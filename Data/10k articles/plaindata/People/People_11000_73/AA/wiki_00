{"id": "11893373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11893373", "title": "Allen West (politician)", "text": "Allen West (politician)\n\nAllen Bernard West (born February 7, 1961) is an American political commentator, retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, and former member of the U.S. House of Representatives. A member of the Republican Party, West represented in the House from 2011 to 2013.\n\nWest was born in Georgia and joined the United States Army in 1983. He was deployed to Kuwait in 1991 and Iraq in 2003. In 2003, West was charged in an incident that involved the beating and simulated execution of an Iraqi policeman. After an Article 32 hearing was held, West accepted non-judicial punishment, was fined $5,000, and allowed to retire as a lieutenant colonel.\n\nAfter leaving the military, he and his family moved to Florida, where he taught at a high school for a year and worked for a defense contractor, part of this time spent in Afghanistan as a civilian adviser to the Afghan National Army. West entered politics in 2008 as the Republican nominee for Florida's 22nd congressional district in 2008, losing to Democratic incumbent Ron Klein. In a re-match in 2010, he won the seat, coinciding with significant Republican gains in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nWest took office in January 2011 as the first African-American Republican Congressman from Florida since Josiah T. Walls left office in 1876 near the end of Reconstruction. In Congress, West served on the Armed Services and Small Business Committees and was a high-profile member of the Tea Party Caucus and the Tea Party movement.\n\nRedistricting due to the 2010 census resulted in West switching to for the 2012 House elections. He lost by 2,146 votes to Democratic nominee Patrick Murphy in what would turn out to be the most expensive congressional race in U.S. history to date. After a recount extended Murphy's lead, the original results were certified and West conceded to Murphy on November 20, 2012. He is a contributor for Fox News and his first book, \"Guardian of the Republic\", was published in April 2014.\n\nAllen Bernard West was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Elizabeth (née Thomas; 1931–1994) and Herman West, Sr. (1920–1986) on February 7, 1961. His father and older brother were both career military officers; West's father served in World War II, and his brother served in Vietnam. His mother was a civilian employee of the United States Marine Corps. Although both of his parents were registered Democrats, West has remarked that they raised him \"very conservatively\".\n\nIn the tenth grade, West joined the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program and entered the United States Army in 1983 when he graduated from the University of Tennessee. West is the third of four consecutive generations in his family to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. He later received a master's degree in political science from Kansas State University. He also earned a master of military arts and sciences degree from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff Officer College in political theory and military history and operations.\n\nWest entered active duty on November 1, 1983, at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he completed the Field Artillery Officer's Basic Course (FACBOC). He then proceeded to airborne training at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he received his Parachutist Badge. West's first assignment was as an airborne infantry fire support officer and platoon leader, as well as battalion training officer for the 4th B.C.T.(Brigade Combat Team), 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg N.C. under the command of Lt. Col. Thomas R. Needham at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza, Italy. In 1987, West was promoted to captain and attended the Field Artillery Officer's Advanced Course. Following graduation, West took command of B Battery, 6th Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. He served as the battalion task force fire support officer for 2d Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment. As a member of the 1st Infantry Division he deployed for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.\n\nAfter redeployment from Kuwait, West served as an Army ROTC instructor at Kansas State University from 1991 to 1994, becoming the U.S. Army ROTC Instructor of the Year in 1993. In January 1995 he was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division Support Command as the assistant operations/combat plans officer. West was promoted to major before he attended the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College in 1997. Upon completion, he became the operations officer for the 18th Field Artillery Brigade before being assigned as executive officer of 1st Battalion, 377th Field Artillery Regiment. Afterwards, West served as an Army exchange officer at the II Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune from 1999 to 2002 and was promoted to lieutenant colonel.\n\nThe culminating assignment of West's career was his assumption of command of the 2d Battalion, 20th Field Artillery Regiment, 4th Infantry Division on June 6, 2002. During the Iraq War in 2003, he deployed with his battalion until he was relieved of command by the Army following a use-of-force incident concerning an Iraqi policeman. At his Article 32 hearing, West admitted violating Army rules by holding the policeman captive, punching him in the face, conducting a mock execution and by firing a pistol held against the Iraqi's head. West was subsequently allowed to retire in 2004.\n\nWest's awards and decorations include the Bronze Star; Meritorious Service Medal (two Oak Leaf Clusters); Army Commendation Medal (three Oak Leaf Clusters, one Valor Device); Army Achievement Medal (one Oak Leaf Cluster); Valorous Unit Award; Air Assault Badge; and the Master Parachutist Badge.\n\nWhile serving in Taji, Iraq, West received information from an intelligence specialist about a plot to ambush his unit. The alleged plot involved Yahya Jhodri Hamoodi, an Iraqi police officer. West had his men detain Hamoodi. Soldiers testified that in the process of detaining Hamoodi, he appeared to reach for his weapon and needed to be subdued. Hamoodi was beaten by four soldiers from the 2/20th Field Artillery Battalion on the head and body. West then fired his pistol near Hamoodi's head, after which Hamoodi provided West with names and information, which Hamoodi later described as \"meaningless information induced by fear and pain\". At least one of these suspects was arrested as a result, but no plans for attacks or weapons were found. West said \"At the time I had to base my decision on the intelligence I received. It's possible that I was wrong about Mr. Hamoodi.\"\n\nWest was charged with violating Articles 128 (assault) and 134 (general article) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During a hearing held as part of an Article 32 investigation in November 2003, West stated, \"I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted to take care of my soldiers.\" The charges were ultimately referred to an Article 15 proceeding rather than court-martial, at which West was fined $5,000. West accepted the judgment and retired with full benefits as a lieutenant colonel in the summer of 2004. Asked if he would act differently under similar circumstances, West testified, \"If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can.\" At his hearing, West said that there were no ambushes against American forces in Taji until he was relieved of his leadership post a month later. After West's retirement he received more than 2,000 letters and e-mails offering him moral support. A letter supporting West was signed by 95 members of the U.S. Congress and sent to the Secretary of the Army.\n\nAfter retiring from the Army, West and his family moved to Florida. He taught U.S. history and coached track and field at Deerfield Beach High School for a year. He then spent two years working for Military Professional Resources Inc. (MPRI), a defense contractor. While with MPRI, West was positioned in Kandahar, Afghanistan. In that capacity, he was an adviser to the Afghan National Army.\n\n\nIn 2006, 25-year incumbent Republican E. Clay Shaw, Jr. was defeated by Democrat Ron Klein in Florida's 22nd Congressional District. Allen West entered politics in 2008 to regain the lost House seat, challenging freshman incumbent Klein. West received the Republican nomination without opposition. However, he lost to Klein by a margin of 9.4% of the votes. The official results were Klein with 169,041 votes (54.7%), West with 140,104 votes (45.3%), and write-in candidate Michael Prysner with 6 votes.\n\nWest spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference on February 20, 2010, and was endorsed by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. West was one of 32 African-American Republican candidates for Congress in 2010. He said he supported the Tea Party movement and rejected the notion that the movement was motivated by racism, saying the accusation was a creation of liberal critics and the news media. West has been described as a \"tea party star\" became a member of the congressional Tea Party Caucus in February 2011.\n\nIn September 2010, the Florida Democratic Party produced a flyer that contained West's unredacted Social Security number. While the party called it an \"oversight\" and offered to pay for identity theft protection, West harshly condemned the flyer for exposing his family to identity theft.\n\nWest defeated incumbent Ron Klein by a margin of 8.8%. West, along with newly elected Tim Scott, were the first African-American Republicans in Congress since J.C. Watts retired in 2003. West raised $5.4 million for his campaign, while his incumbent opponent raised $2.5 million. According to West, \"...over 97 percent of our donations have come from individual contributions.\"\n\nWest raised more than $1.5 million in the 2011 second quarter to support his 2012 reelection bid. The \"National Journal\"s Cook Political Report in 2011 named West one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012.\n\nRedistricting made the 22nd, which already had a modest Democratic lean, even more Democratic. West faced the prospect of running against West Palm Beach mayor Lois Frankel in the general election. On February 1, 2012, West announced that he would run for reelection in the neighboring 18th District. That district had previously been the 16th, represented by fellow Republican Tom Rooney. However, Rooney opted to seek reelection in the newly created 17th District, a move that was considered likely to dramatically improve West's chances of reelection, although it was still a competitive race.\n\nIn the new district, West received a primary challenge from Martin County Sheriff Robert Crowder. West did not debate Crowder and said \"debating an uninformed opponent would waste voters' time\". Incumbent West defeated Crowder in a landslide, receiving 74.4% of the vote.\n\nHis general election opponent was Democrat Patrick Murphy, a political newcomer and a Republican until 2011. The campaign featured several negative ads, including one released by American Sunrise PAC that was extremely critical of West's policies and depicted him in violent cartoon action against several individuals. West issued a statement condemning the ad, stating that it \"plays on stereotypes\" with the goal of diverting Americans from more pressing matters at hand such as high unemployment. He claimed the ad was released by the family of his opponent. The campaign manager of his opponent, said the ad was from a third party and therefore held no liability for it. After primary opponent Crowder endorsed Murphy, a spokesman of the West campaign said \"Crowder is a Democrat and a sore loser. I'm shocked he waited this long. Perhaps Crowder hopes to continue cozying up to local Democrats so he can be their nominee against Allen West in 2014.\"\n\nInitial vote counts showed Murphy defeating West by a narrow margin of 2,000 votes. West did not concede, citing irregularities in St. Lucie County where some early ballots may have been counted twice. Florida state election officials unofficially certified Murphy as the winner, A partial recount of early ballots cast between November 1 and 3, 2012, in St. Lucie County slightly decreased the margin separating the candidates, and the West campaign sought further recounts. West said that if the final results show a loss, he would not cling to his title as a member of Congress, but wanted to ensure a fair election was carried out, raising the potential of a protracted legal battle. As of the November 18 state deadline, the St. Lucie County election officials had not completed a recount of all of the early ballots, and so the previously submitted vote count which showed Murphy as the winner by 2,146 votes was submitted to the state election officials. The West campaign conceded the election on November 20, 2012. Meanwhile, Frankel went on to victory in the 22nd.\n\nWest's rhetoric won him both support and condemnation from differing groups along the American political spectrum. Members of the conservative movement viewed him as a \"torch bearer\" and \"conservative icon\", with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent both suggesting him for vice president, and Glenn Beck supporting him for president. In January 2013, U.S. Representatives Paul Broun (R-Georgia) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) both voted for West as Speaker of the House, even though he was no longer a member of Congress. Some of his statements include calling President Barack Obama \"an abject failure\", ordering both pro-Palestinian demonstrators and the views of \"chicken men\" Democrats to \"get the hell out\" of the United States, opining that drivers with Obama bumper stickers are \"a threat to the gene pool\", and pronouncing that African American Democrats are trying to keep African Americans \"on the plantation\", while casting himself as the \"modern-day Harriet Tubman\" ferrying them to rescue. In a critical summation of West's style, the liberal magazine \"Mother Jones\" opined that \"[for West] every sentence is a proxy war in the larger struggle between patriots and the 'people in this world that just have to have their butts kicked.'\".\n\nIn January 2011, West joined House Foreign Affairs Committee chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) in condemning the official flying of a Palestine Liberation Organization flag in Washington D.C. West said that the raising of the flag is \"an attempt to legitimize an organization with a known history of terrorist actions\". In February, West described Michael Ledeen as one of his \"foreign policy heroes\", and implored his followers to read Saul Alinsky's \"Rules for Radicals\" to \"understand what they're up against\". Other authors West has cited in helping him shape his worldview include philosopher John Stuart Mill and Union Army General William Tecumseh Sherman.\n\nOn June 2, 2011 Allen West wrote a letter to President Obama urging him to grant clemency to Jonathan Pollard. Mr. West wrote, \"After serving 26 years behind bars, Jonathan Pollard's health is deteriorating, as is his wife's. If we can consent to the release by the British of the Lockerbie bomber back to Libya due to health concern, how can we justify keeping Mr. Pollard behind bars when his crimes were clearly not as serious as a terrorist who murdered hundreds of Americans?\" Pollard was released on November 20, 2015, in accordance with federal guidelines in place at the time of his sentencing. Anne Pollard, his ex-wife, said \"No one helped him. No government reduced his sentence by even one day.\"\n\nWest attempted to cast his work overseas in historical terms, theorizing that America is following in the footsteps of Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours, or the 300 Spartan Hoplites at the Battle of Thermopylae, in defending Western civilization against Muslim threats from the Middle East. In speaking on what he believed to be Islam's proclivity for violence, West remarked that \"Something happened when Mohammed enacted the Hijra and he left Mecca and he went out to Medina, it became violence.\" Because of this view, in February 2011, West cited the threat of \"radical Islamic terrorists\" as his motivation for voting to extend provisions of the Patriot Act; He voted against another extension in May 2011. When asked during an interview with \"The Shalom Show\" how he would work with others \"like Keith Ellison, who supports Islam\", West stated that Ellison, a Minnesota representative and practicing Muslim, represents the \"antithesis of the principles upon which this country was established\". West later argued that his initial comment was misconstrued. He said the comments were \"not about his Islamic faith, but about his continued support of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)\". In a Boynton Beach Town Hall meeting, West told the Miami leader of CAIR that \"I will always defend your right to practice a free religion under the First Amendment, but what you must understand, if I am speaking the truth, I am not going to stop speaking the truth. The truth is not subjective.\"\n\nOn July 19, 2011, West sent an email to Democratic representative and Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in response to comments directed at him in a speech the congresswoman made on the floor of the House of Representatives after West had departed the chamber. West's email, which he copied to members of House Democratic and Republican leadership, characterized Wasserman as \"the most vile, unprofessional, and despicable member of the US House of Representatives\", said that she was \"not a lady\" and asked that she focus, instead, on her own congressional district. This is a long-standing dispute that West says \"dates back to the disgusting protest you ordered at my campaign headquarters, October 2010 in Deerfield Beach\".\n\nAt a town hall meeting in Palm City, Florida on April 11, 2012, West was asked by a man in the audience, \"What percentage of the American legislature do you think are card carrying Marxists or International Socialists?\" West responded that \"there's about 78 to 81 members of the Democrat Party that are members of the Communist Party.\" When asked to name them, he replied \"It's called the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\"\n\nWest was appointed to the House Armed Services Committee and the Small Business Committee.\n\n\nWhen West joined the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) on January 5, 2011, he became the first Republican to join the CBC since former Congressman Gary Franks of Connecticut retired in 1997.\n\nOn May 16, 2013, Fox News announced it had hired West as a contributor to offer political commentary during the network's daytime and prime time shows.\n\nFollowing the Charleston church shooting in 2015, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley called for the Confederate Battle flag to be removed from a memorial outside the state capital. West referred to the debate over the flag as a \"manufactured crisis\" invented by liberals to distract from black-on-black violence.\n\nOn December 9, 2016, West's official Facebook page posted a call for the extermination of Muslims. The editor and chief of allenbwest.com later removed and apologized to his readers for posting inappropriate content and stated West had no part in the post.\n\nIn 2014 column, West described himself as a classical liberal.\n\nWest is a Life and Endowment Member of the National Rifle Association (NRA). In May 2016, he announced that he had been elected as a member of the NRA Board of Directors for a three-year term.\n\nWest was an Executive Director and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a free-market public policy research organization.\n\nIn September 2015, West was nominated to the Sunset Advisory Commission, which oversees the need for Texas state agencies, as the Texas Senate's appointed public member.\n\nWest was first married to Gayle Mosby. Later, West married Angela M. Graham on December 24, 1989. She holds a Ph.D. in education from Kansas State University, and received a gubernatorial appointment to the board of trustees of Florida Atlantic University. They have two daughters. West and his family moved to Texas after he became CEO of the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis in January 2015. He is a Christian.\n\nHe is a certified master scuba diver, motorcycle enthusiast and honorary member of the Blue Knights International Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club. He was a co-host for Troopathon 2013.\n\n"}

{"id": "471154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=471154", "title": "Anthony Barber", "text": "Anthony Barber\n\nAnthony Perrinott Lysberg Barber, Baron Barber, TD, PC, DL (4 July 1920 – 16 December 2005) was a British Conservative politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nAfter serving in both the Territorial Army and the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Barber studied at Oxford and became a barrister. Elected as MP for Doncaster in 1951, Barber held various posts in government under Harold Macmillan, including Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Minister of Health. After losing his seat in 1964, he won the 1965 by-election in Altrincham and Sale and returned to Parliament.\n\nBarber was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer by Edward Heath in 1970, and oversaw a major liberalisation of the banking system, replaced purchase tax and Selective Employment Tax with Value Added Tax, and also relaxed exchange controls. During his term the economy suffered due to stagflation and industrial unrest, including a miners strike which led to the Three-Day Week. In 1972 he delivered a budget which was designed to return the Conservatives to power in an election expected in 1974 or 1975. This budget led to a period known as \"The Barber Boom\". The measures in the budget led to high inflation and wage demands from public sector workers. He was forced to introduce anti-inflation measures, along with a Prices Commission and a Pay Board. After the Conservatives lost the first election in 1974, he did not stand in the second election of that year. Barber became Chairman of Standard Chartered Bank until 1987 and died in 2005.\n\nBarber was the third son of John Barber and his Danish wife, Musse. His birth was registered in Sculcoates, a suburb of Kingston upon Hull. Barber's unusual middle names arose from his mother, who contributed the \"Lysberg\", and French grandmother, who contributed the \"Perrinott\". His father was secretary-director of a Doncaster confectionery works. He had two brothers: Noel, who became a well-known journalist and novelist, and Kenneth, who became secretary of Midland Bank.\n\nBarber was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in Retford, Nottinghamshire. He became an articled clerk, but joined the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry shortly before the Second World War started. He was commissioned into the Territorial Army Royal Artillery in 1939 and served in France with a unit from Doncaster as part of the British Expeditionary Force. He was evacuated from Dunkirk in 1940, but later he became a pilot in the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit of the RAF. He ran out of fuel on a reconnaissance mission on 25 January 1942 and ditched near Mont St Jean, but was captured by the Germans.\n\nHe was mentioned in dispatches for helping escapes from the prison camp at Stalag Luft III; he himself once escaped as far as Denmark. His PoW experiences were recalled by his friend and fellow RAF pilot PoW Thomas D. Calnan who met Barber at Oflag IX-A/H at Spangenberg in February 1942:\n\nBarber is a prominent figure throughout Calnan's book:\n\nBarber also wrote a brief foreword to this volume: \"What has struck me most forcibly is how, after more than twenty years, he has recounted our adventures with such accuracy. He has managed to make a reality, once again, of the hopes and fears, the depression and the excitement which, for most of us who were there, now seems more like a dream.\"\n\nWhile still a prisoner, Barber took a law degree with first-class honours through the International Red Cross. On his return to England, he was awarded a state grant to Oxford University, where he took a degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics in two years at Oriel College, and a scholarship to the Inner Temple. He then practised as a barrister from 1948, and specialised in taxation. From 1967 to 1970 he was chairman of Redfearn National Glass, with which his wife Jean's family was connected.\n\nAnthony Barber stood in Doncaster at the 1950 general election but lost by 878 votes. He contested the seat again at the 1951 general election, however, and beat the incumbent Labour Member of Parliament, Raymond Gunter by 384 votes. He held a series of offices: Parliamentary private secretary to George Ward (Under Secretary for Air) from 1952 to 1958; junior Government whip from 1955 to 1958; and Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan from 1958 to 1959. He then served four years as a junior minister in the Treasury, Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 1959 to 1962, and, following the \"Night of the Long Knives\" on 13 July 1962, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1962 to 1963 (under the Chancellorships of Derick Heathcoat Amory, Selwyn Lloyd and Reginald Maudling). He became a Cabinet minister, as Minister of Health, in 1963, but lost his seat in the Commons in the 1964 general election to Labour's Harold Walker.\n\nHis absence from Parliament was short-lived, as he won a 1965 by-election in Altrincham and Sale caused by the elevation to the peerage of Frederick Erroll. In opposition, he led Ted Heath's campaign to become Conservative party leader in 1965, and became party chairman in 1967. The Conservatives won the general election in 1970, and Barber held his seat until the general election of October 1974, when he himself entered the House of Lords.\n\nAfter winning the election in 1970, Edward Heath appointed Barber as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and gave him the responsibility for negotiating the entry of the UK into the European Economic Community. However, following the sudden death of Iain Macleod on 20 July, only 6 weeks after the election, Barber became the new Chancellor of the Exchequer. His appointment prompted Harold Wilson to remark that it was the first time that he had realised that Heath had a sense of humour. In line with the initial liberal instincts of Heath's 1970 government, he oversaw a major liberalisation of the banking system under the title of 'Competition and Credit Control', leading to a high level of lending, much of it to speculative property concerns. In his first Budget, in March 1971, he proposed to replace purchase tax and Selective Employment Tax with Value Added Tax, and also relaxed exchange controls; both were prerequisites to membership of the EEC. VAT came into force in 1973 at a standard rate of 10%. A year later, the rate was cut to 8%.\n\nBarber also reduced direct taxes. High levels of economic growth followed, but the traditional capacity constraints of the British economy - especially currency and balance of trade concerns - quickly choked the economic boom. The banking system fell towards crisis as the bubble burst.\n\nDuring his term the economy suffered due to stagflation and industrial unrest. In 1972 he delivered a budget which was designed to return the Conservative Party to power in an election expected in 1974 or 1975. This budget led to a period known as \"The Barber Boom\". The measures in the budget led to high inflation and wage demands from Public Sector workers. He was forced to introduce anti-inflation measures in September 1972, along with a Prices Commission and a Pay Board. The inflation of capital asset values was also followed by the 1973 oil crisis which followed the Yom Kippur War, adding to inflationary pressures in the economy and feeding industrial militancy (already at a high as a result of the struggle over the Industrial Relations Act 1971).\n\nIn 1972, having said a week earlier in the House of Commons that he had \"no reason to believe that the pound was overvalued\", he floated it (most of the world currencies were floated at that time) \"as a temporary measure\". The pound immediately plunged on the markets, and it was impossible during his time as Chancellor to impose a new parity. It has remained floating ever since.\n\nAfter a strike by the miners, and a Three-Day Week, Heath called for a general election on 28 February 1974 with the slogan \"Who governs Britain?\" The election returned a minority Labour government and Harold Wilson as Prime Minister.\n\nBarber did not seek re-election at the general election of October 1974, and left front-line politics. He was made a life peer on 6 January 1975 as Baron Barber of Wentbridge in the County of West Yorkshire, and served as Chairman of Standard Chartered Bank from 1974 to 1987, where future Prime Minister John Major was his personal assistant. In 1987, he was appointed to be a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of West Yorkshire. Barber was also a director of BP from 1979 to 1988. He visited Nelson Mandela in prison, and was a member of the Franks Committee that investigated the Falklands War. In 1991, he became chair of the RAF Benevolent Association’s appeal for the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, which raised £26 million.\n\nHe suffered from Parkinson's disease in later years, and died in Suffolk in 2005. He was married twice, with two daughters from his first marriage.\n\n\n\n"}

Anukulchandra registered the Bengali branch of Satsang in Himaitpur.\n\nOn 2 September 1946 before the Partition of India, Anukulchandra moved to Deoghar in India from his birthplace Himaitpur, Pabna. This is where Satsang currently has its main center. Anukulchandra died on 27 January 1969.\n\nAnukulchandra was born on September 14, 1888 in Himaitpur village in the Pabna district of Bangladesh. His father was Sivachandra Chakravarty and his mother was Manomohini Devi. He started his formal education at Himaitpur village elementary school in 1893. In 1898, he was admitted to Pabna Institute and studied there up to the eighth grade. He attended Raipur High School at Amirabad for a short period and then in Naihati High School in the 24 Parganas of West Bengal until 1905. He did not graduate, having given away his matriculation exam registration fees to a classmate who he found crying as he was not able to afford the registration fees. Later, he was admitted to the Calcutta National Medical College, having tested-out of the school's high school diploma requirement.\n\nIn high school, he wrote several short plays, the first in 1905. He also wrote songs and poems which were later published in a book, \"Debjani-O-Anyanya\". In 1910, Anukulchandra wrote some guiding instructions for one of his friend Atulchandra Bhattachariya, that was later published in 1918 as booklet called \"Satyanusaran\" (The Pursuit of Truth).\n\nIn 1906, his parents arranged for him to marry Sorashibala, aged 11, daughter of Ramgopal Bhattacharya. He later also also married Sarbomangala Devi who is popularly known as Choto Ma.\n\nAfter finishing medical school, Anukulchandra started practicing homeopathy in Himaitpur in 1912. He reportedly paid for his patients' medicine and provided financial help. Anukulchandra did not have a fixed rate for seeing patients and he accepted fruits and vegetables as payment for his services.\n\nAs the number of people who started to follow him increased rapidly, an organization came into being. He did not formally establish or lay the foundation of Satsang ceremoniously. Satsang evolved normally, naturally, spontaneously. The philanthropic activities of Satsang multiplied and spread far within a few years. Thakur Anukulchandra’s interest in science seeped into those with a scientific bent of mind and pat came Vishya Bigyan Kendra (World Science Centre) where with a few simple apparatus began researches in various fields. Then came up Satsang Chemical Works where manufacturing of medicines based on Sree Sree Thakur’s formulae began. Then Satsang Press, Satsang Publishing House, and other establishments found the light of the day as the necessity arose. The construction work for these establishments and other rooms for the purpose of habitation were carried out by the ashramites themselves including the women, starting from digging soil to making bricks and doing masonry. And it was the women who ran the works of Satsang Press. Satsang is currently headquartered in Deoghar, India. \n\nAfter the ashram was rebuilt in Deoghar, numerous institutes were started. Tapovan school was started with a particular focus on building character, self-dependence in addition to regular studies. Satsang ananda bazar, which was initially established by Manmohini Devi, was also resumed, to feed visitors, refugees were fed free of cost. Till date, this institution exists and feeds thousands of people twice a day free of cost. Deoghar being a rain-starved region faces acute scarcity of water in summer. To alleviate these problems, Satsang Water Works department was started which supplies fresh water drawn from the river Dwarka to the ashram. A number of deep wells and water harvesting techniques are used to meet the water requirements of the ashram as well as town-dwellers.\n\nChittaranjan Das, one of the eminent leaders in India’s struggle for independence was a disciple of Anukulchandra. He visited the ashram with his family on a number of occasions. He also had invited Mahatma Gandhi to visit the ashram. On visiting the ashram, Mahatma Gandhi was in particular impressed by Anukulchandra’s devotion for his mother and also by the magnificent personality of Manmohini Devi.\n\nNetaji Subhashchandra Bose, another eminent leader in Indian independence movement, also visited the ashram in Pabna, Bangladesh on couple of occasions. His parents were followers of Anukulchandra. He commented on the uniqueness of the ashram in that unlike a “sanyasi” who renounced all wordly ties, the ashram was a pioneer in establishing a place where people could live the life of a “sanyasi” along with their families. \n\nAfter his death on 27 January 1969, his oldest son Amarendranath Chakravarty (21 November 1911 – 6 August 1995), known as Sree Sree Borda, led the activities of Satsang Today the activities are headed by Ashok Chakravarty, grandson of Anukulchandra and son of Amarendranath Chakravarty.\n\nAnukulchandra wrote \"The degeneration of humanity began at that moment when the unseen God was made infinite and, ignoring the seers, the worship of their sayings began. Oh mankind! If you desire to invoke your good, forget sectarian conflict. Be regardful to all the past prophets. Be attached to your living master or God and take only those who love Him as your own. Because all the past prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present.\" Anukulchandra did not accept anyone as his disciple if he or she wanted to change his or her faith. According to Ramesh Nagaraj Rao, Anukulchandra advocated that people of all faiths could come together and strengthen communal harmony. Ray Hauserman, one of his American devotees, wrote a book \"Commitment to a Christian Renewal: Conversations with an Indian Sage\" which describes Anukulchandra's convergence philosophy in the West.\n\nExcept a few short plays, poems, and songs published as \"Debojani O Ananya\", the only book written by Anukulchandra is \"Satyanusaran\". His dictations in the form of rhymes has been compiled into multiple volumes of books by Satsang Publishing House, which was established by Anukulchandra. Many of his conversations and found new episodes within of which lectures have been recorded by appointed followers and have also been published. He wrote numerous pamphlets in Bengali to promote his organization.\n\nAccording to Sree Sree Thakur, all the past prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present. He said the so-called religions are just views, and each individual may have an independent view of their own. There is absolutely no opposition among the views, rather the same way feeling of the One in many forms.\n\nHe promoted several controversial ideas such as polygamy, Eugenics and unscientific world views. He suggested his female devotees that women should never complain to their abusive husbands in any condition and should accept that her ultimate goal is to submit herself to Husbands will.\n\nSatsang Centres (places where devotees assemble regularly) are present in multiple places around the world (US, Canada, UK, Australia, Singapore, UAE, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India). Satsang Vihars are present in many states of India Gujarat, West Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Orissa, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra to name a few).\n\nOn 2 September 1987 (100th anniversary) of Sree Sree Thakur, Government of India has released a postage stamp on Him.\n\n \n"}

{"id": "1189627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1189627", "title": "Caroline Norton", "text": "Caroline Norton\n\nCaroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton (22 March 1808 – 15 June 1877) was an English social reformer and author active in the early and mid-nineteenth century. Caroline left her husband in 1836, following which he sued her close friend Lord Melbourne, the then Whig Prime Minister, for criminal conversation (i.e. adultery). The jury threw out the claim, but Caroline was unable to obtain a divorce and was denied access to her three sons. Caroline's intense campaigning led to the passing of the Custody of Infants Act 1839, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 and the Married Women's Property Act 1870. Caroline modelled for the fresco of \"Justice\" in the House of Lords by Daniel Maclise, who chose her because she was seen by many as a famous victim of injustice.\n\nCaroline was born in London to Thomas Sheridan and the novelist Caroline Henrietta Callander. Her father was an actor, soldier, and colonial administrator, and the son of the prominent Irish playwright and Whig statesman Richard Brinsley Sheridan and his wife Elizabeth Ann Linley. Caroline's mother was Scottish, the daughter of a landed gentleman, Col. Sir James Callander of Craigforth and Lady Elizabeth MacDonnell, the sister of an Irish peer, the 1st Marquess of Antrim. Mrs. Sheridan authored three short novels described by one of her daughter's biographers as \"rather stiff with the style of the eighteenth century, but none without a certain charm and wit...\"\n\nIn 1817, her father died in South Africa, where he was serving as the colonial secretary at the Cape of Good Hope. His family was left virtually penniless. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, an old friend of her grandfather's, arranged for Caroline's family to live at Hampton Court Palace in a \"grace and favour\" apartment, where they remained for several years.\n\nThe combined beauty and accomplishments of the Sheridan sisters led to their being collectively referred to as the Three \"Graces\". The eldest sister, Helen, was a songwriter who married Price Blackwood, the 4th Baron Dufferin and Claneboye. Through her, Caroline became the aunt of Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, who later served as the third Governor General of Canada and eighth Viceroy of India. Her younger sister, Georgiana, considered the prettiest of the three, later became the wife of Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset.\n\nIn 1827, Caroline married George Chapple Norton, barrister, M.P. for Guildford, and the younger brother of Lord Grantley. Norton was a jealous and possessive husband, given to violent fits of drunkenness, and the union quickly proved unhappy due to his mental and physical abuse of Caroline. To make matters worse, Norton was unsuccessful in his chosen career as a barrister, and the couple fought bitterly over money.\n\nDuring the early years of her marriage, Caroline used her beauty, wit, and political connections, to establish herself as a major society hostess. Caroline's unorthodox behaviour and candid conversation raised more than a few eyebrows among 19th-century British high society; she made enemies and admirers in almost equal measure. Among her friends she counted such literary and political luminaries as Samuel Rogers, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Edward Trelawny, Abraham Hayward, Mary Shelley, Fanny Kemble, Benjamin Disraeli, the future King Leopold I of Belgium and William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire.\n\nIn spite of his jealousy and pride, Norton encouraged his wife to use her connections to advance his career. It was entirely due to her influence that in 1831 he was made a Metropolitan Police Magistrate. During these years, Caroline turned to prose and poetry as a means of releasing her inner emotions and earning money. Her first book, \"The Sorrows of Rosalie\" (1829), was well received. \"The Undying One\" (1830), a romance founded upon the legend of the Wandering Jew, soon followed.\n\nIn 1836, Caroline left her husband. Caroline managed to subsist on her earnings as an author, but Norton claimed these as his own, arguing successfully in court that, as her husband, Caroline's earnings were legally his. Paid nothing by her husband, her earnings confiscated, Caroline used the law to her own advantage. Running up bills in her husband's name, Caroline told the creditors when they came to collect, that if they wished to be paid, they could sue her husband.\n\nNot long after their separation, Norton abducted their sons, hiding them with relatives in Scotland and later in Yorkshire, refusing to tell Caroline anything of their whereabouts. Norton accused Caroline of being involved in an ongoing affair with her close friend, Lord Melbourne, the then Whig Prime Minister. Initially, Norton demanded £10,000 from Melbourne, but Melbourne refused to be blackmailed, and Norton instead took the Prime Minister to court.\n\nLord Melbourne wrote in a letter to Lord Holland that, \"The fact is he (Norton) is a stupid brute, and she had not temper nor dissimulation enough to enable her to manage him.\" Despite this admission, hoping to avert an even worse scandal, he pleaded with Caroline to return to Norton, insisting that \"a woman should never part from her husband whilst she can remain with him.\" Lord Melbourne relented a few days later, stating that he understood her decision to leave:\n\nThis conduct upon his part seems perfectly unaccountable...You know that I have always counselled you to bear everything and remain to the last. I thought it for the best. I am afraid it is no longer possible. Open breaches of this kind are always to be lamented, but you have the consolation that you have done your utmost to stave this extremity off as long as possible.\n\nThe trial lasted nine days, and in the end the jury threw out Norton's claim, siding with Lord Melbourne. However, the resulting publicity almost brought down the government. The scandal eventually died away, but not before Caroline's reputation was ruined and her friendship with Lord Melbourne destroyed. Norton continued to prevent Caroline from seeing her three sons, and blocked her from receiving a divorce. According to English law in 1836, children were the legal property of their father, and there was little Caroline could do to regain custody.\n\nCaroline was soon faced with an additional tragedy; the death of her youngest son, William, in 1842. The child, out riding alone, suffered a fall from his horse and was injured. According to Caroline, the child’s wounds were minor; however, they were not properly attended and blood-poisoning set in. Norton, realising that the child was near death, sent for Caroline. Unfortunately, William died before she arrived in Scotland. Caroline blamed Norton for the child's death, accusing him of neglect. After William's death, Norton allowed Caroline to visit their sons, but he retained full custody, and all of her visits were supervised.\n\nDue to her dismal domestic situation, Caroline became passionately involved in the passage of laws promoting social justice, especially those granting rights to married and divorced women. Her poems \"A Voice from the Factories\" (1836) and \"The Child of the Islands\" (1845) centred on her political views.\n\nWhen Parliament debated the subject of divorce reform in 1855, Caroline submitted to the members a detailed account of her own marriage, and described the difficulties faced by women as the result of existing laws.\n\nAn English wife may not leave her husband's house. Not only can he sue her for restitution of \"conjugal rights,\" but he has a right to enter the house of any friend or relation with whom she may take refuge...and carry her away by force...\n\nIf her husband take proceedings for a divorce, she is not, in the first instance, allowed to defend herself...She is not represented by attorney, nor permitted to be considered a party to the suit between him and her supposed lover, for \"damages.\"\n\nIf an English wife be guilty of infidelity, her husband can divorce her so as to marry again; but she cannot divorce the husband, a vinculo, however profligate he may be...\n\nThose dear children, the loss of whose pattering steps and sweet occasional voices made the silence of [my] new home intolerable as the anguish of death...what I suffered respecting those children, God knows ... under the evil law which suffered any man, for vengeance or for interest, to take baby children from the mother.\nPrimarily because of Caroline's intense campaigning, which included a letter to Queen Victoria, Parliament passed the Custody of Infants Act 1839, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 and the Married Women's Property Act 1870. Her most recent biographer Diane Atkinson notes that unlike in 1839 and 1857, Caroline played no part in the campaigning for the 1870 Act. Under the Custody of Children Act legally separated or divorced wives, provided they had not been found guilty of criminal conversation, were granted the right to custody of their children up to the age of seven, and periodic access thereafter. The Act applied in England, Wales and Ireland only. While Caroline could have hoped for custody of her youngest son, and access to her older sons who were seven and ten when the Act was passed into law, her husband insisted that her sons stay in Scotland.\n\nThe Act gave married women, for the first time, a right to their children. However, because women needed to petition in the Court of Chancery, in practice few women had the financial means to petition for their rights. The Matrimonial Causes Act reformed the law on divorce, amongst others making divorce more affordable, and established a model of marriage based on contract. The Married Women's Property Act 1870 allowed married women to inherit property and take court action on their own behalf. The Act granted married women in the UK, for the first time, a separate legal identity from their husband.\n\nIn 1849 Daniel Maclise finished his fresco of \"Justice\" in the House of Lords, for which Norton had modelled. He chose her because she was seen by many as a famous victim of injustice. Caroline's old friend, Lord Melbourne, opposed the reforms she fought for. He was scolded for his opposition by Queen Victoria; the Queen wrote that he defended his actions, stating: \"I don't think you should give a woman too much right...there should not be two conflicting powers...a man ought to have the right in a family.\"\n\nWhile Caroline fought to extend women's legal rights, she wasn't involved in further social activism, and had no interest in the 19th-century women's movement with regard to issues such as women's suffrage. In fact, in an article published in \"The Times\" in 1838, countering a claim that she was a \"radical\", Caroline stated: \"The natural position of woman is inferiority to man. Amen! That is a thing of God's appointing, not of man's devising. I believe it sincerely, as part of my religion. I never pretended to the wild and ridiculous doctrine of equality.\"\n\nCaroline is said to have had a five-year affair with prominent Conservative politician Sidney Herbert in the early 1840s; however, Herbert married another woman in 1846. In middle age, she befriended the author George Meredith. She served as the inspiration for Diana Warwick, the intelligent, fiery-tempered heroine of Meredith's novel \"Diana of the Crossways\", published in 1885. Caroline finally became free with the death of George Norton in 1875. She married an old friend, Scottish historical writer and politician Sir W. Stirling Maxwell in March 1877. Caroline died in London three months later.\n\nHer eldest son, Fletcher Norton, died of tuberculosis in Paris at the age of thirty. Caroline was devastated by the loss.\n\nIn 1854, her remaining son, Thomas Brinsley Norton, married a young Italian, Maria Chiara Elisa Federigo, whom he met in Naples. Thomas also suffered from poor health, and spent much of his life as an invalid, reliant upon his mother for financial assistance. Despite his ill health, he lived long enough to succeed his uncle as 4th Baron Grantley of Markenfield. Lord Grantley also predeceased his mother, dying in 1877.\n\nHis son, John, inherited the title and estates. The 5th Lord Grantley was a numismatist, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, the Royal Numismatic Society and the British Numismatic Society. He assembled a large collection of coins and also grew orchids. Caroline Norton's grandson caused a scandal in 1879, when he ran off with another man's wife, the former Katharine McVickar, daughter of a wealthy American stockbroker. The jilted husband was the 5th Lord Grantley's older cousin, Major Charles Grantley Campbell Norton. Katharine's marriage to Charles was annulled, and Katharine and John were married that November, five days before the birth of their first child. Despite her scandalous introduction to British society, Katharine went on to become a successful London hostess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3422293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3422293", "title": "Cassie Turner", "text": "Cassie Turner\n\nCassandra \"Cassie\" Turner is a fictional character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera \"Home and Away\", played by Sharni Vinson. She debuted on-screen during an episode that aired on 18 March 2005. Vinson originally auditioned for the role of Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon), but later secured the role of Cassie. She admitted it was a challenge to portray a character six years her junior who was still attending school. Cassie's backstory reveals that she was abused as a child by her uncle. However, her characterisation is out of conjunction with the usual victims of such crimes. She is portrayed as \"fiercely independent and headstrong\" female who has a knack for \"winning friends and influencing people\". Cassie is popular with the serial's male characters, while her allure also broadened off-screen to male viewers. Cassie is given a foster family when Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) and Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) take her into their home.\n\nCassie has featured in various romance storylines; in one she begins a relationship with Macca MacKenzie (Trent Baines). The serial decided to portray as domestic abuse through the two characters. Cassie was seen pushing those closest to her away, while Macca continued his abuse. Vinson also visited females with the virus as part of the research process. The storyline was well received by carriers of the virus and Vinson said it was a \"big moment\" in her acting career. Vinson has received one Logie Award nomination for her portrayal of Cassie. In 2007, Vinson decided to leave \"Home and Away\" because of personal commitments. Cassie departed screens on 2 April 2008, when she left to go travelling.\n\nSharni Vinson appeared in \"Home and Away\" in 2001 and 2003, as guest characters named Tonya and Summer respectively. In 2004, Vinson's agent submitted her to audition for the role of Martha MacKenzie. Vinson received a re-call for the role and was also handed scripts for another character, Cassie Turner. However, fellow actress Jodi Gordon went on to secure the role of Martha. Vinson said she wanted to play Martha because she was characterised as a tomboy, a trait which Vinson attributes to herself. Soon after, Vinson signed up to play Cassie. Vinson was twenty one at the time, while Cassie was portrayed as a fifteen-year-old student. Vinson later described the experience as \"such a stretch\" because she \"well out of school and then I was back into a school uniform, with the pigtails, no makeup, playing this real young character.\" In her first few months on-screen, producers decided to cast Todd Lasance as Aden Jefferies. Aden was introduced as a new boyfriend for Cassie and was planned to heavily feature in her early storylines. \n\nIn 2006, rival channel Network Ten tried to tempt Vinson into joining pop group Girlband, however she decided to stay in \"Home and Away\". In July 2007, media outlets reported that Vinson wanted to quit the serial in order to pursue other projects in Los Angeles. In November that year it was confirmed that Vinson had quit \"Home and Away\" so she could move to Los Angeles to be with her boyfriend. However, the serial refused to comment on her departure because Cassie would still be seen on-screen into 2008. Vinson said she was happy that she got to play Cassie, because she enjoyed the work and portraying her storylines. By the time Vinson left, Cassie had appeared in a total of one hundred and three episodes.\n\nCassie has been described as having a \"fiercely independent and headstrong\" persona. While she is able to learn from her mistakes and has a knack when it comes to \"winning friends and influencing people\". Cassie's independence and \"strong-will\" is attributed to her upbringing. After many problems in her childhood she was forced to live with her grandmother, Joy (Elaine Lee) after her mother abandoned her. She was the only family Cassie had and has been described as \"devastated\" when she died. Cassie has also been the victim of child abuse; this initially meant she was \"deeply troubled\". However counseling helped her to \"learn how to live without anxiety.\" Vinson told Yahoo!7 that Cassie is \"mature\" for a fifteen-year-old. As she has had to go through so much in her life, she \"is older in the head than she realises\". She also said that at the same time she can act \"naive because she is young\". In 2005, the characters of Cassie, Martha and Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans) were used by the Seven Network to promote their clothing range. The characters were seen on-screen dressed in items from their clothing line.\n\nIn one storyline Cassie begins a relationship with Macca MacKenzie (Trent Baines), which turns violent when Macca starts to hit her. Cassie initially leaves Macca, but decides she loves him and dates him in secret. Those closest to Cassie are ashamed of her when they discover the truth. \"Female First\" opined that Cassie \"cried her heart out\" and \"wished the whole world would just swallow her up\" because of her dilemma. The publication also felt that there was nothing Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) could do to help Cassie, because she herself would not admit the truth.\n\nAfter being assaulted by Macca, he convinces her to leave her family and friends behind and move away with him. The \"Daily Record\" said that Macca had \"hardly been the ideal boyfriend\" and said it wasn't hard to see why Cassie had doubts about leaving with him. Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) tries to help Cassie, but she proves \"stubborn\" and decides to leave with Macca. He uncharacteristically warns Sally that she is in danger of losing her foster daughter for good. They said it was the first point in the storyline that Macca did a \"mature, sensible thing\". Five said that Macca would \"trash her as soon as he looked at her\". They opined that they were sure she would realise the truth about him in the end. They also hoped that other residents would listen to her. As the storyline came to a conclusion, Cassie finally became brave enough to leave Macca. However, he tracked her down and hit her again.\n\nCassie was later involved in a notable storyline in which she contracts HIV from Henk Van Patten (Damian De Montemas). \"Home and Away\" producers first informed Vinson about the HIV storyline in mid-2007. They also asked for her opinion on the development. Vinson was initially worried about the serial's early timeslot on the Seven Network, coupled with the \"intense\" nature of the storyline. However, she changed her mind upon receiving the scripts because she thought they were well written. When the storyline was screened, Vinson explained that Cassie is \"in love, engaged and expecting a baby\" so she thinks her life \"couldn't be more fantastic\". When Cassie discovers she is HIV positive, she feels as though she has hit \"the bottom of the barrel\" and knows that \"her life's changed forever\". Vinson added that after, Cassie finds the situation \"incomprehensible\" and cannot \"understand\" what has been told. She goes \"numb\" and is \"overcome with shock\". Cassie cannot cope with her \"nightmare\" and rushes out into the street, \"straight into the path of an oncoming car\". Cassie is then rushed to hospital following being run over and viewers were kept guessing as to whether her baby would survive.\n\nThe storyline was the first that Vinson \"actually bothered\" to go out and research. Vinson and her drama coach visited hospitals to meet with HIV positive females. Vinson received letters from HIV positive people, praising her portrayal of the issue. The moment that Cassie discovers she has the virus was well received by viewers. Vinson said that the feedback had made her \"happy\" and that playing the scenario was a \"big moment\" for herself as an actor. In early 2008, Cassie's exit storyline reported in the media over two months before she was due to depart. It was revealed that Cassie would leave to travel the world with Sally, before the birth of her daughter.\n\nCassie meets Ric while jet-skiing, it soon becomes clear she stole the vehicle and they escape the owner. She meets Ric once again and they go skinny dipping at the beach. Cassie steals his clothes and forces him to go home naked. Cassie attends the \"Miss Groper\" pageant where her grandmother, Joy is taking part. When she does not win, she gets into an argument with Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood), collapses and later dies. Cassie's uncle turns up, but she has flashbacks from her childhood where it is revealed he used to abuse her. He is reported to the police and Sally and Flynn decided to take Cassie into their home. Cassie becomes close to Ric, who is also fostered by Sally and Flynn. Their sexual tension becomes too much, but when it came to sleeping together, Cassie has flashbacks of her uncle Ben (Craig Elliot) abuse and subsequently breaks up with Ric. Cassie starts dating Aden and Ric becomes jealous of their relationship. Ric tackles Aden during a football match, so Aden's brother, Sean (Gabriel Egan) attacks Ric, causing Cassie to dump Aden and later gets back with Ric. Cassie is distraught when she discovers that Flynn is dying from cancer. She cannot cope with him wanting to end his life and goes on a rampage during a cyclone. She becomes trapped with Ric when an electricity cable falls on them. Sally and Flynn rescue them, but are electrocuted in doing so. Although they survive, Flynn later dies from his tumor and Cassie finds it hard to cope with his death.\n\nWhen Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) arrives in Summer Bay, she feels threatened by her friendship with Ric and dumps him. She then meets Martha's adoptive brother, Macca and starts to date him. Their romance faces problems when she complains about not being able to see him often and the effect his prescription medication has on him. After more arguments Macca hits Cassie and she decides to forgive him, but reconciles with Ric after he dumps Belle. However, Belle still wants Ric so she convinces Cassie to tutor Drew Curtis (Bobby Morley), while she unsuccessfully attempted to steal Ric back. Ric attends a mechanical course in the city, while Macca returns claiming to have overcome his anger issues. Cassie realises she still has feelings for Macca and gets back together with him. When Ric finds out she has cheated, Cassie decides to move out of her home despite Sally telling her that she does not want her to go and stay with Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). Macca later receives a job offer in the city and asks Cassie to move with him. After an argument with Sally, Cassie decides to take up his offer. Macca feels bad and tells Sally that she should fight for Cassie; however she does not listen to Sally's pleas and moves. Cassie visits Summer Bay as much as she can; however her visits annoy Macca who begins to beat her up again. After a few more assaults, Cassie feels she has to move back home, but agrees to continue their relationship. Macca tracks her down and hits her again, before handing himself into the police.\n\nCassie decides to start at a charity helpline for domestic abuse victims. Brad Armstrong (Chris Sadrinna) helps her set the charity up and Dan Baker (Tim Campbell) acts as a counsellor. Cassie's first caller for help, Lily Nelson (Kathryn Beck) intrigues Cassie, who then meets up with her. Cassie wins Lily's trust and discovers she is being domestically abused by her boyfriend Kyle Sanders (Anthony Gee). Cassie uses her own experiences with Macca to convince Lily to leave Kyle. Cassie moves Lily into Summer Bay House, but when Sally finds out the truth she forces Lily to leave. Cassie goes to visit Lily, but Kyle turns violent, prompting Sally and Brad to save them. Lily moves back in with Cassie, but she becomes obsessed with protecting her. When Jules Munro (Joel Phillips) arrives, she warns Lily off him believing that he is bad. When Lily nearly drowns in the sea, Jules does not help her. This makes Cassie believe she is correct about him, however they soon realise they are attracted to one another. Jules lures Cassie into a driving lesson, but sabotages the car so he can spend time with her. Jules keeps trying to impress Cassie and even undresses for her. However, she seems more interested in Alex Poulos (Danny Raco). Jules becomes jealous and steals Alex's bike, which forces him to leave town and before he leaves he tells Cassie that he loves her. Cassie becomes close with Alex but is shocked when she discovers that he is dealing drugs. Jules later turns up again and they become close again. Jazz Curtis (Rachel Gordon) ruins their relationship when she lies to Cassie, claiming that she has been sleeping with Jules.\n\nCassie starts dating Henk which annoys Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), who reveals that Henk raped her when she was younger. However, Cassie refuses to believe it and begins a serious relationship with him. Henk later comes bored and dumps Cassie. She later attends a party with Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans) and where Aden is smoking marijuana. Cassie drives them home despite drinking; when Aden distracts her she crashes the car and is arrested for drunk driving. Henk returns to support Cassie, who is let off with her offence. Cassie discovers that she is pregnant and she and Henk decide to get married. Cassie takes a blood test and discovers that she has contracted HIV from Henk. She runs out of the surgery and is run over by an oncoming car. Although she recovers, Henk leaves her once again and Rachel supports her through her troubles. When Henk returns to win Cassie back, she refuses and tells him she needs to be alone. Aden has to take a HIV test after he got Cassie's blood on her in the crash, but the test returns negative but refuses to forgive Cassie. She is heartbroken when Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Cassie he wants nothing to do with her because she has HIV. Colleen also voices her prejudice by implying she may infect Sally's baby. They both later apologize when Cassie raises awareness of the virus and gains everyone's support. Sally suggests that Cassie goes travelling with her, which she accepts. Cassie decides to have one last road trip with her best friend, Matilda and travel by car. Cassie feels her baby kick for the first time and waves goodbye to the town’s residents as she leaves for her new life.\n\nFor her portrayal of Cassie, Vinson was nominated in the category of \"Most Popular New Female Talent\" at the 2006 Logie Awards. Soap opera magazine \"Inside Soap\" said that whenever fictional characters are happy, \"disaster lurks around the corner\". They opined that it was \"no surprise\" that Cassie's world \"came crashing down\" when she discovers she is HIV positive. The \"Birmingham Mail\" chose the moment that Cassie realised Jules fancied her as their \"pick of the day\". A columnist for the \"Sunday Mirror\" said that Cassie \"set pulses racing\" and branded her a \"sexy soap siren\". They also opined that Vinson herself was a \"sexy Home & Away starlet\" and that her departure was \"bad news\" and \"disappointing\" for men who watch the serial. While the \"Daily Record\" opined that Cassie's actions over Lily were always set to lead her into trouble. While they acknowledged that she is a \"well-meaning teen\", they felt that by going to such lengths to save one caller in-turn endangered \"the future\" of the helpline charity.\n\n"}

It is now recognised as the first Chinese imperial dynasty in the modern sense of the term; in recognition of this, its rulers were for the first time titled \"Emperor\" (皇帝), a title of which the components are drawn from legend, higher than the previous title \"King\" (王). The ancestral name of the family was Ying (嬴), although it is anachronistic to regard this as a family name in the modern sense: it would not have been used together with a given name. The titles of the Qin emperors were literally regnal numbers: \"Qin Shi Huang\" (秦始皇), in full \"Qin Shi Huangdi\" (秦始皇帝) means literally \"the first Emperor of Qin\", \"Qin Er Shi\" (秦二世), in full \"Qin Er Shi Huangdi\" (秦二世皇帝) means \"the second Emperor of Qin\", and so forth.\n\nEmperor Xian, the last emperor of the Han dynasty, was a descendant of the first emperor Liu Bang. Lasting for over 400 years, the Han Dynasty is regarded as one of the golden ages of Chinese history. The Han Dynasty was interrupted by the reign of the usurper Wang Mang, who declared the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD); on this basis, the Han Dynasty is generally divided into the Western Han (206 BC – 9 AD and 23–25 AD) and the Eastern Han (25–220 AD). The rulers of the Shu Han, one of the three successor states to the Han Dynasty during the Three Kingdoms period, were descended from the Han imperial family, and considered themselves a continuation of the Han Dynasty; they are included below.\n\n- - - - - = The dashed line denotes an adoption\n\nThe following is a family tree for the Jin dynasty, which ruled a unified China during the Western Jin Dynasty (265–316 AD). Although greatly weakened by the War of the Eight Princes during the reign of the developmentally disabled Emperor Hui, when members of the clan fought among themselves for imperial control, and forced Eastwards after the conquest of their capital in 316 AD, the dynasty nonetheless continued in the form of the Eastern Jin Dynasty until 420 AD.\n"}
{"id": "49895669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49895669", "title": "Clotilde Micheli", "text": "Clotilde Micheli\n\nBlessed Clotilde Micheli (11 September 1849 - 24 March 1911) was an Italian Roman Catholic professed religious who established the order known as the Sisters of Angels; she assumed the new name of \"Maria Serafina of the Sacred Heart\" upon the order's foundation and her profession into it. She had once before been part of a religious order in which she received the name of \"Maria Annunziata\" but discarded it when she left their ranks.\n\nMicheli was beatified in Benevento in 2011 after Pope Benedict XVI granted approval for her beatification to take place. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the celebration on the behalf of the pontiff.\n\nClotilde Micheli was born in Imer, Austrian Empire on 11 September 1849. She received Confirmation at the age of three in 1852 from the Bishop of Trent Blessed Johann Nepomuk von Tschiderer zu Gliefheim.\n\nDuring her childhood she had her first apparition in which her Guardian Angel came to her with an invitation from the Blessed Mother to consecrate herself as a virgin to her. She had her First Communion in 1858 at the age of nine and after this felt a strong pull to the religious life; she spent her nights in long periods of adoration to the Eucharist. As a child she received her education from her mother who instilled in her a sense of virtue and the fundamental Christian ethics. On the night of 2 August 1867 - in the parish church of her hometown - the Blessed Mother appeared with angels around her and showed her that it was Micheli's mission to found a religious congregation that would have as its crucial aim the adoration of God and Jesus Christ as the spirit under her patronage.\n\nMicheli received the consolation of a friend and went to Venice for the spiritual guidance of Mgr. Domenico Agostini - future cardinal and Patriarch of Venice - who advised her to draft a Rule; she was frightened at the prospect of this and believed she had no inspiration so returned in sadness to her hometown having written nothing. Micheli relocated to Padua in 1867 close to the priest Angelo Piacentini whom she confided her doubts to. She remained under his spiritual direction until his death in 1876; in 1878 she realized that her parents - without her knowledge - was in the process of arranging a marriage for her. Her response to this was to flee to Epfendorf in the German Kingdom. Micheli remained there until 1885 where she worked as a nurse in a clinic that the Elizabethan Sisters ran. However her mother died in 1883 and her father followed in 1885 around the time she left Epfendorf for her hometown and remained there alone until 1887 when she decided to discern her project for a congregation.\n\nWhile she was in Epfendorf - on 10 November 1883 - she passed through to find a church for her to reflect in and found a church that she failed to realize was in fact a Protestant church. Her Guardian Angel came to her and said: Arise for this is a Protestant church. But I want to make you see the place where Martin Luther was condemned and the pain he suffered as a punishment for his pride\"; Micheli saw demons who had forced Luther to his knees and confirmed he was consigned to the fires of Hell.\n\nAlongside her niece Giuditta she - in May 1887 - set out on foot for a pilgrimage to Rome and made it an objective to stop at all Marian sanctuaries along the route as a means of receiving further inspiration for her project. In August she arrived in Rome and joined the order known as the Suore Immacolatine; she took the habit and received the name of \"Maria Annunziata\". She remained with that order until 1891 and served as the Mother Superior of a convent in the village of Sgurgola in the Diocese of Anagni. She came to know the Franciscan priest Francesco Fusco da Trani while she was in Assisi during her pilgrimage and he wrote to her in order to advise her to leave her order and go to Piedimonte d'Alife where the Bishop Antonio Scotti had plans for an order of his own. However upon meeting Scotti she realized their plans were not at all similar.\n\nMicheli then travelled to Caserta and - alongside the nun Filomena Scaringi - remained in a household with people who provided her with both material and spiritual support. She set her own house in Casolla with two women and led to the Bishop of Caserta Enrico De Rossi authorizing the small congregation Micheli had established as the Sisters of the Angels on 28 June 1891. She discarded her previous religious name and took the name of \"Maria Serafina of the Sacred Heart\". During her lifetime her order flourished with a total of fifteen houses being established. The order would later spread elsewhere to places such as Indonesia and Benin. A house in Faicchio opened in June 1899 as a place for formation.\n\nShe became quite ill in 1895 - almost close to death - and refused herself medical treatment. Instead she was moved elsewhere for a period of rest in order to recover from her illness. On one particular occasion a seminarian - whom Satan had possessed - arrived in the garden adjacent to the convent and asked for her. The sisters did not want to fatique Micheli so said she wasn't there; the seminarian knew this was a lie and began to inveigh against the sisters in an inhuman voice. Micheli then approached and demanded he be quiet to which the voice said: \"You are damned!\"; the sisters inquired about the demons present to which the inhuman voice said: \"we are seven\". Micheli took the seminarian aside to listen to him and then applied both holy water and the sign of the Cross on him - this succeeded in driving the devils out of him and was a successful exorcism.\n\nMicheli died on 24 March 1911. Her remains are interred in Faicchio.\n\nThe beatification process commenced on 9 July 1990 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints - under Pope John Paul II - declared \"nihil obstat\" (nothing against) to the cause which also granted her the posthumous title of Servant of God. The diocesan process spanned from 1 October 1990 until 15 March 1992 and saw the thorough investigation of her life as well as the visions that she was prone to. Upon the closure of this process all documentation was submitted to Roman officials for investigation on their end; the so-called \"Roman Phase\" commenced on 2 July 1993 after the diocesan process was cleared of having done its work according to the set criteria.\n\nThe postulation compiled and submitted the Positio to Rome for further investigation while the large dossier included biographical details as well as attesting to the manner in which she led her life according to Christian values. This also had to face the historical commission on 14 January 2003 who had to determine whether or not there were obstacles to the cause; the historians approved it and thus would allow the cause to continue.\n\nOn 3 July 2009 she was conferred the title of Venerable after Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged the fact that Micheli had practiced a model Christian life of heroic virtue - both cardinal and theological.\n\nThe process for the miracle required for her beatification opened on 28 November 2003 in the diocese of its origin and closed on 25 January 2005; it was then submitted to Roman officials for further investigation and received formal ratification on 20 May 2005. The Rome-based medical board met in order to discuss if the healing was indeed a credible miracle and approved it after meeting on 3 December 2009 while consulting theologians approved it on 26 March 2010; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints followed suit on 8 June 2010 and passed it to Benedict XVI for his approval on 1 July 2010.\n\nMicheli received beatification on 28 May 2011 in Benevento; Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the behalf of Benedict XVI.\n\nThe current postulator assigned to the cause is Sr. Giuseppina Romano.\n\n"}

He played in all five matches as halfback.\n\nGoodsir-Cullen was born in Kerala, India and educated at St. George's College at Musoorie, and Madras University where he qualified as a medical doctor. During World War II he served as an officer in the Indian Army Medical Corps where he was attached to several different regiments and was posted to Iraq and Palestine on active service. In 1945 he married Captain Elsie Victoria Spratt, a QA officer in the British Army and their first son, Sean Patrick, was born in March 1946 in Poona. In 1947 the family went to live with Elsie's mother in Portstewart, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland and Ernest had to re-qualify as a doctor at Queen's University, Belfast.\n\nGoodsir-Cullen continued playing hockey. At club level he played for Portrush and Queen's University. He also played for Ulster and was asked to play at the 1952 Olympics for Ireland, 16 years after representing India in Berlin.

He was nicknamed Burbulieus (after an actor) for the way he moved his body while speaking. Curio was noted as a public orator and for the purity of his Latin language.\n\nCurio was a tribune of the plebs in 90 BC. He later served as a legate under Lucius Cornelius Sulla in Greece and Asia during the campaign against Mithridates. He laid siege to the tyrant Aristion, who had taken position on the Acropolis, during the attack on Athens. Several years later, in 76 BC, he was elected consul with Gnaeus Octavius.

{"id": "244245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244245", "title": "George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville", "text": "George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville\n\nGeorge Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville, PC (26 January 1716 – 26 August 1785), styled The Honourable George Sackville until 1720, Lord George Sackville from 1720 to 1770 and Lord George Germain from 1770 to 1782, was a British soldier and politician who was Secretary of State for America in Lord North's cabinet during the American War of Independence.\n\nHis ministry received much of the blame for Britain's loss of thirteen American colonies. His issuance of detailed instructions in military matters, coupled with his failure to understand either the geography of the colonies or the determination of the colonists, may justify this conclusion. He had two careers. His military career had distinction, but ended with a court martial.. Sackville served in the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, including at the decisive Battle of Minden. His political career ended with the fall of the North government in March 1782.\n\nSackville was the third son of Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant-General Walter Philip Colyear. His Godfather George I attended his baptism. He was educated at Westminster School in London and graduated from Trinity College in Dublin in 1737. Between 1730 and 1737 and again from 1750 to 1755, his father held the post of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. While in Dublin he befriended the celebrated writer Jonathan Swift. He also encountered Lord Ligonier who would later assist his career in the military.\n\nHe then entered the army. Sackville was elected Grandmaster of the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1751, serving in this post for the next two years.\n\nHe married Diana Sambrooke, daughter of John Sambrooke and Elizabeth Forester, on 3 September 1754. They had two sons and three daughters, including:\n\nSackville started as a captain in the 7th Horse (later the 6th Dragoon Guards). In 1740, he transferred to the Gloucestershire Regiment of Foot as a lieutenant colonel. The regiment was sent to Germany to participate in the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1743. Sackville was advanced to brevet colonel.\n\nHe saw his first battle, leading the charge of the Duke of Cumberland's infantry in the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. He led his regiment so deep into the French lines that when he was wounded and captured he was taken to the tent of Louis XV. When he was released and returned home, it was to duty in Scotland as the Colonel of the 20th Foot Regiment.\n\nIn 1747 and 1748, he again joined the Duke of Cumberland. He became colonel of the 7th Irish horse and served in Holland. There was a break in his military career between wars (1750-1755) when he served as first secretary to his father.\n\nDuring the Seven Years' War, Sackville returned to active military service. He had been considered for the post of Commander-in-Chief in North America, which eventually went to Edward Braddock who led his force to disaster during the Braddock Campaign. In 1755, he was promoted to major general and returned to active service to oversee ordnance. In 1758, he was given a fourth regiment and joined the Duke of Marlborough as a lieutenant general. He was sworn of the Privy Council in January 1758.\n\nIn June 1758 Sackville was second in command of a British expedition led by Marlborough which attempted an amphibious Raid on St Malo. While it failed to take the town as instructed, the raid was still considered to have been largely successful as a diversion. Follow-up raids were considered against Le Havre, Caen and other targets in Normandy but no further landings were attempted and the force returned home.\n\nLater in 1758 they joined the allied forces of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick in Germany, with the first detachment of British troops sent to the Continent. When Marlborough died, Sackville became Commander of the British contingent of the army, although still under the overall command of the Duke of Brunswick.\n\nIn the Battle of Minden on 1 August 1759, British and Hanoverian infantry of the centre made an advance on the French cavalry and artillery in that sector. They apparently went in without orders and their attacking line formation even repulsed repeated French cavalry charges, holding until the last moment then firing a massive volley when the charge came within ten yards. As the disrupted French began to fall back on Minden, Ferdinand called for a British cavalry charge to complete the victory, but Sackville withheld permission for their advance. Ferdinand sent his order several times, but Sackville was estranged from Lord Granby, the force commander. He continued to withhold permission for Granby to \"gain glory\" through an attack. For this action, he was cashiered and sent home. Granby replaced him as commander of the British contingent for the remainder of the war.\n\nSackville refused to accept responsibility for refusing to obey orders. Back in England, he demanded a court martial, and made it a large enough issue that he obtained his demand in 1760. The court found him guilty, and imposed one of the strangest and strongest verdicts ever rendered against a general officer. The court's verdict not only upheld his discharge, but ruled that he was \"...unfit to serve his Majesty in any military capacity whatsoever\", then ordered that their verdict be read to and entered in the orderly book of every regiment in the army. The king had his name struck from the Privy Council rolls.\n\nSackville had been a Member of Parliament at intervals since 1733. He had served terms in both the Dublin and the Westminster bodies, sometimes simultaneously, but had not taken sides in political wrangles.\n\nBetween 1750 and 1755 he served as Chief Secretary for Ireland, during his father's second term as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\n\nWhen George III took the throne in 1760, Sackville began his political rehabilitation. There did not seem to be negative repercussions to the European stalemate of the Seven Years' War. The victories over the French within the colonial empire provided a chance for events of the war to be forgotten. The difficulty of repaying the debts incurred to fight the war caused a period of unstable ministries and shifting political alliances. In 1765, King George quietly returned him to the rolls of the Privy Council.\n\nInitially he was a follower of George Grenville's faction but he increasingly lined up as a supporter of Lord North and, in 1769, he made this alliance formal. Then, in 1769, Lady Elizabeth Germain died without natural heirs, and left her estates, including Drayton, Northamptonshire, to him. This not only improved his finances, it also gave him the chance to take that name formally. After 1770, he was known as Lord George Germain.\n\nOn 10 November 1775, Germain was appointed Secretary of State for the American Department replacing Lord Dartmouth in the post. At that time, North's cabinet had three secretaries of state; one each for Europe (the Northern Department), America, and the rest of the world (the Southern Department). Besides international relations, these secretaries were responsible for a great deal of Colonial administration and for military operations within their area. This made Germain the primary minister responsible for suppressing the rebellion that had broken out in 1775 in the colonies. He promoted or relieved Generals, took care of provisions and supplies, and became involved with the strategic planning of the war.\n\nSackville and Lord North made three assumptions about the war they were about to face: firstly, the American forces could not withstand the assaults of the British; secondly, the war would be similar to wars they had fought successfully in Europe; and lastly, their victory would bring about their goal of having the colonies' allegiance. All of their assumptions proved to be false, with the limited and unhelpful exception of the first, in that the American forces usually could not withstand the assaults of the British in open battle but instead adopted other, more successful, tactics.\n\nIn 1776 he worked with General Burgoyne to plan, support and issue orders for the Saratoga campaign. However, his unclear orders to General Howe contributed to the campaign's failure. Following the entry of France, Spain and the Dutch Republic into the conflict, British emphasis shifted to focus increasingly on a global war. British troops were withdrawn from Philadelphia and reinforcements were sent to the valuable sugar-producing West Indies. In 1779 one of Germain's associates, Richard Cumberland was sent to Madrid for talks designed to reach a separate peace settlement with Spain, but this attempt failed.\n\nIn 1781, the confusion involving orders sent to Cornwallis from Clinton contributed to the loss at Yorktown.\nThe news of Yorktown reached London on 25 November 1781 and the messenger went first to Germain's residence at Pall Mall. Germain then went to tell other ministers. Together they went to Lord North who reportedly cried out \"Oh God - It's all over\". It was agreed that Germain, rather than North, should take the news to the King who was at Kew. The King's Speech two days later had to be re-written in light of Yorktown. News of the surrender galvanised the Opposition and government majorities began to shrink over the following months with calls for resignations of senior ministers. Germain drew up a plan to continue the war using the existing British bases in Charleston, New York, Savannah and Canada to harass the American coastline and frontiers. He also advocated re-occupying Newport in Rhode Island to give a foothold in New England.\n\nGermain became a target for the opposition, and was eventually persuaded to step down in exchange for a peerage, and in February 1782 he was made Baron Bolebrooke, in the County of Sussex, and Viscount Sackville, of Drayton in the County of Northampton. This was considered essential if the North government was to survive by bringing in factions of the opposition, to whom Germain was personally objectionable. He was replaced by Welbore Ellis. In spite of Germain's departure, the North government fell shortly afterwards in February 1782 and was followed by a period of political instability. Shortly after the fall of the North government, news arrived of the decisive British naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes in the Caribbean, which would have boosted the government had it still been in power. The Shelburne government agreed to the Peace of Paris, bringing an end to the war in 1783 and recognising the independence of the United States.\n\nThe controversy over Lord Sackville's handling of the war continued. Some members were opposed to his taking a seat in the House of Lords, an almost unprecedented incident. In spite of this he was admitted to the Lords, where he was staunchly defended by Lord Thurlow, and his declining health soon made the issue irrelevant. He retired to his country home at Stoneland Lodge and died there in 1785. He maintained to his dying day that he had not been a coward at Minden. Following his death, a defence of Sackville's reputation, \"The character of the late Viscount Sackville\", was written by Richard Cumberland.\n\nThe Drayton House estate passed to his son Charles, who later became the 5th (and last) Duke of Dorset. The Stoneland estate (or Buckhurst Park as it came to be known) passed via the wife of the late 3rd Duke of Dorset to her daughter Countess de la Warr on the Dowager Duchess's death in 1825.\n\n\n"}

One of the first Balinese dancers to study in the United States, Bandem earned his master's degree in dance from UCLA, and his PhD in ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University. Bandem's academic career includes sixteen years as the director of the Indonesian College of the Arts in Denpasar, and was also the Rector(President) of Indonesia's oldest cultural institution, the Institut Seni Indonesia - Jogjakarta (Indonesian Institute of The Arts - Jogjakarta). Dr. Bandem is succeeded by Prof. Soeprapto Soedjono, B.A., M.F.A., Ph.D as the current Rector(President) of The Indonesian Institute of the Art - Jogjakarta. Dr. Bandem is currently a professor of Balinese dance and music at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nAt Holy Cross, Bandem currently teaches both music and dance dealing with the Bali-Gamelan. He is well respected throughout Bali and many other countries as an integral component to the recognition, respect, and continuation of the Balinese culture.\n\nAs an artist and as a visiting scholar, Bandem has taught and performed Balinese dance throughout the world.\n\nBandem’s accomplishment and contribution to arts and culture can be group into four major domains including achievements in ethnomusicology, , arts and culture management, and political career.\n\nBandem is the first Indonesian to accomplish the Ph.D title in ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut (1980). As a scholar in the field of world music, Bandem fathoms and advances a school of thought popularly termed as the “bi-musicality” that was initially promoted by Prof. Dr. Mantle Hood. Bandem refers bi-musicality as a conception that music is a universal language and every ethnomusicologist must comprehend more than one genre of world music.\n\nDuring his studies in the USA, Bandem learnt and came to terms with sounds and rhythms from around the world including music genre of Japan, Thailand, Korea, as well as China. In return, such experience gave Bandem the capabilities and firmness to conduct in-depth research of various Nusantara (Indonesian) music including Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Java, and Bali. Aside from immersing himself in the studies of world music, Bandem also mastered the integral aspects of dance and theatre – all influencing his scientific approaches.\n\nAs an ethnomusicologist, Bandem has published plenty of books and scientific articles pertaining arts and culture, both nationally and internationally. One of his writing that is highly regarded as a classic by artists of music, dance, and theatre is the book \"\" (1981; reprinted 1995) and distributed by Oxford University Press, Kuala Lumpur. This book has induced worldwide appreciation upon the arts and culture of Bali. Other theoretical publications about music, dance, and theatre of Indonesia include \"\", \"Wayang Wong in Contemporary Bali\", \"Traditional Theatre of Indonesia\", and \"Encyclopedia of Balinese Dance\" – all these books are text books and reference for those studying Indonesian arts. Aside from writings concerning performing arts, Bandem also possess great interest in fine arts, and many of his articles are closely related to historical and aesthetic studies of Indonesian fine arts.\nBandem’s commitment in ethnomusicology augmented with the establishment of an Indonesian music association namely Masyarakat Musicology Indonesia (MMI) by him and a group of friends in 1985. MMI hails from Surakarta, Central Java, and Bandem was the first chairman of the non-profit association. Today, MMI has advanced as Masyarakat Seni Pertunjukan Indonesia (MSPI), as a center for research, creation, and development of Indonesian arts, both classic and contemporary. With this organization, Bandem has managed to raise and popularize ethnomusicology as a major discipline in art universities in Indonesia.\n\nIn 1986, Bandem initiated The First International Gamelan Festival; an evaluation on the advancement of gamelan in the global milieu that was conducted in conjunction with the 1986 Vancouver Expo in Canada. During the festival, more than 250 delegates participated and represented gamelan (traditional Indonesian music orchestra) and ethnic music groups from all over the world. The festival is evidence that Indonesian music especially its various sorts of gamelan are integral part of the world music setting.\n\nBandem played an important role in the progression of Indonesian arts and culture through teachings in many universities including the University of Hawaii, University of California, Los Angeles, Wesleyan University, University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Brown University.\n\nThe outstanding response led to the amplification of studies upon the Indonesian arts and culture particularly in the learning of the music and dance.\n\nConsequently, many leading universities in the United States of America, Canada, Japan and Europe sought the inclusion of Indonesian art and culture studies into their curriculum. According to Balungan and Ear Magazine, there are more than 300 active gamelan groups around North America, Europe, Japan and Australia.\n\nIn 2006, Bandem was awarded the Fumio Koizumi Prize for his dedication and long life achievement in the field of ethnomusicology.\n\nAfter attaining his Ph.D, Bandem returned to Indonesia from the USA and was appointed as the Chancellor of the Indonesia Dance Academy (ASTI) Denpasar by the Ministry of Education and Culture (1982). Since then, Bandem exerted great effort to amplify the institution’s status to become Indonesian Arts College (STSI) Denpasar and now Indonesia Institute of Arts. The efforts to increase the status of the institution to a higher level is not only a matter of political administration, but more a struggle to advocate arts as science, to equally position art in contrast to other field of studies. This struggle becomes imperative as the majority of Indonesia still view art as a profession (vocation), not a substantial field of study.\n\nBandem’s formulation of art from the perspective of ontology, epistemology, and axiology became the groundwork for the Ministry Department of National Education Indonesia to permit Indonesian art universities to conduct S-1, S-2 (Master of Art), and S-3 (Ph.D.) programs. Bandem’s effort with the collective support from other art scientists in Indonesia entitled Indonesia Institute of Arts (ISI) Jogjakarta to conduct and award Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Doctor of Creative Art (DCA) in the field of art.\n\nAs an educational administrator, Bandem was trusted by the Ministry Department of National Education Indonesia to lead ASTI Denpasar (1981-1989), STSI Denpasar (1989-1997) and ISI Jogjakarta (1997-2006). In his 25 years in office, many of his conceptions became the model for the development of art universities in Indonesia.\n\nIn 1998, Bandem successfully established Badan Kerjasama Perguruan Tinggi Seni Indonesia (Indonesia Art University Cooperative Board). This association has initiated and produced the “New Paradigm of Art Universities”, a manual being used as the foundation to conduct higher learning of arts in Indonesia. Bandem truly plays a central role in increasing the quality of art education in Indonesia.\n\nIn conjunction to his duties as Rector of art universities over the past 25 years, Bandem was also given responsibility by the National Government as Secretary and Consortium Member of Komisi Disiplin Ilmu Seni (Commission for Art Discipline) that is an integral aspect of Indonesian Academy of Sciences. Bandem was also member of Badan Pertimbangan Pendidikan Nasional (Advisory Board of National Education), an organization pertaining national education under the direct supervision of the President of Republic Indonesia. Bandem dedicated his ideas through this governing body to make education in Indonesia as education for unity in diversity and to influence the government to implement multimedia based education. In response to such policy, currently Bandem is the chancellor of a leading information and computer technology university in Bali.\n\nAs an artist, Bandem also learns and performs the dances and music of other cultures. While Bandem is well known for his creative directing in monumental works in Balinese performing arts, he also masters the Gagaku and Bugaku, the classical Japanese music and dance that he learned from his teacher Matsaro Togi, a national treasure of classical Japanese dance.\n\nFurthermore, Bandem is also a culture engineer. His policy on preservation and development of the traditional Balinese arts and culture is formulated into a strategic development plan termed Sustainable Development with Cultural Orientation. One interesting interpretation of this policy is Continuity in Change, an aspect elaborated and practiced in many occasions including the Bali Arts Festival.\n\nTogether with Prof. Dr. Ida Bagus Mantra, the Governor of Bali (1978-1988), Bandem is among the founding fathers and driving force behind the Bali Arts Festival. This annual event has become a mental model for the preservation and development of the Balinese arts and culture as a whole. Currently, The Bali Arts Festival has entered its 27th year\n\nBandem has been actively involved in outlining the annual theme of the Bali Arts Festival from 1980 to 1997, as well as being executive producer and creative directors of numerous performances for the festival.\n\nThe successful impact of the Bali Arts Festival as means for arts and culture development has influenced the province of Yunnan in China to implement such festival. Bandem became the consultant for the festival particularly outlining preservation and development strategies for the arts and culture of minority groups within.\n\nBandem was also the Artistic Director for many Indonesian performances in numerous World Expos and other International Arts Festival. These include Expo Vancouver (1986), Expo Brisbane (1988), Indonesian Festival in USA (1990, 1991), Expo Sevilla (1992), Hanover Fair (1995) and Indonesia Japan Friendship Festival (1997).\n\nFor his role and influence in increasing quality of output and abundance of art masterpieces receiving great reviews in and abroad, Collin's Guide to Bali refers Bandem as the \"Bali Art Czar\".\n\nIn 1997, Bandem also accomplished the establishment of the Museum Gamelan (The Museum for Musical Instruments of Indonesia) within the dynamic compounds of the Indonesian Arts College (STSI, now ISI) Denpasar. The museum itself holds the largest collection of musical ensembles native to Indonesia, where all musical ensembles as well as the hundreds of various musical instruments being displayed are intended to become a medium for arts education. The museum is equipped with an archive centre that holds various forms of recordings, all representing documentation of the arts and culture. Other collections on exhibit include dance costumes, masks, shadow puppets, sculpture and paintings.\n\nHis devotion to fine arts is profuse and is advanced through active participation within the fine art scene. Together with his diverse network of arts and culture enthusiasts, Bandem established the first ever Bali Biennale; the biannual visual arts exhibition in 2005.\n\nThe holding of both the Pre-Bali Biennale in 5 cities in Java and 9 venues in Bali, as well as the Summit Event Bali Biennale in 9 venues in Bali as well as the Cartoon Pavilion is a reconstruction upon the traditional creative propensities of Balinese visual arts, as creativity is not grouped on the base of its customary aesthetic style, school and movement but is viewed from the perspective of Bali as a geo-culture unity that corresponds to the greater multiculturalism in today’s global society.\n\nBandem is the current chairman of the Bali Biennale Organizing Committee.\n\nIn 1994, UNESCO awarded the International UNESCO Music Council Award to Bandem as recognition upon his wholehearted attention and dedication upon the world of arts and culture as well as the implementation of his concepts.\n\nBandem grew interest in the field of practical politics since senior high school and he has been trusted by his colleagues to lead a political organization called GSNI. Bandem not only took charge of the senior high school level organization, but also became the Vice Chairmen of GSNI for Bali.\n\nDuring his time in the USA particularly in Hawaii and California, Bandem actively lead PERMIAS (Indonesian Student Association in United States of America). Bandem’s extensive network abroad has been constructed since these times.\n\nAfter completing his doctoral studies in USA, Bandem returned to Bali and continued his enthusiasm in Indonesian politics. Soon after his return, Bandem was appointed as the Vice Chairmen of the major political party Golongan Karya in Bali from 1982-1998. This position permitted Bandem to become a member of the Indonesian House Assembly (MPR-RI) as state representative for the Province of Bali (1988-1998).\n\nDuring his time as member of the Indonesian House Assembly (MPR-RI), Bandem was elected as the Secretary and Speaker for the Ad Hoc II Committee that is responsible for strategies and decisions of the national politics. Through this committee, Bandem demonstrated his keenness for Indonesian character building from the viewpoint of arts and culture.\n\nFurthermore, although unsuccessful, Bandem was supported by the Balinese public as candidate for the 1998-2003 Governor of Bali during the 1998 election.\n\nTaken as a whole, Bandem’s stance towards the significance of arts and culture as a vibrant counterpart to the pulsating dynamics of socio-culture, political, and technology represents a notion that arts and culture are imperative elements for peace, concord, and the betterment of the world.\n\nHis belief for cordial cross-border interconnectedness by the means of arts and culture has bestowed him the Habibie Award in 2003 from the Habibie Center. \nHis pro-active approach has emphasized the importance of arts and culture as a reflective conscious to attain harmony among nations especially between respective cultures and the global forces.\n"}
{"id": "163704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163704", "title": "Joachim du Bellay", "text": "Joachim du Bellay\n\nJoachim du Bellay (also Joachim Du Bellay; ; c. 1522 – 1 January 1560) was a French poet, critic, and a member of the Pléiade.\n\nJoachim du Bellay was born at the Castle of La Turmelière, not far from Liré, near Angers, being the son of Jean du Bellay, Lord of Gonnor, first cousin of the cardinal Jean du Bellay and of Guillaume du Bellay. His mother was Renée Chabot, daughter of Perceval Chabot and heiress of La Turmelière (\"Plus me plaît le séjour qu'ont bâti mes aïeux\").\n\nBoth his parents died while he was still a child, and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother, René du Bellay, who neglected his education, leaving him to run wild at La Turmelière. When he was twenty-three, however, he received permission to study law at the University of Poitiers, no doubt with a view to his obtaining preferment through his kinsman the Cardinal Jean du Bellay. At Poitiers he came in contact with the humanist Marc Antoine Muret, and with Jean Salmon Macrin (1490–1557), a Latin poet famous in his day. There too he probably met Jacques Peletier du Mans, who had published a translation of the \"Ars Poetica\" of Horace, with a preface in which much of the program advocated later by La Pléiade is to be found in outline.\n\nIt was probably in 1547 that du Bellay met Ronsard in an inn on the way to Poitiers, an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the French school of Renaissance poetry. The two had much in common, and became fast friends. Du Bellay returned with Ronsard to Paris to join the circle of students of the humanities attached to Jean Dorat at the Collège de Coqueret.\n\nWhile Ronsard and Jean-Antoine de Baïf were most influenced by Greek models, du Bellay was more especially a Latinist, and perhaps his preference for a language so nearly connected with his own had some part in determining the more national and familiar note of his poetry. In 1548 appeared the \"Art poétique\" of Thomas Sébillet, who enunciated many of the ideas that Ronsard and his followers had at heart, though with essential differences in the point of view, since he held up as models Clément Marot and his disciples. Ronsard and his friends dissented violently from Sébillet on this and other points, and they doubtless felt a natural resentment at finding their ideas forestalled and, moreover, inadequately presented.\n\nThe famous manifesto of the Pléiade, the \"Défense et illustration de la langue française\" (Defense and Illustration of the French Language, 1549), was at once a complement and a refutation of Sébillet's treatise. This book (inspired in part by Sperone Speroni's \"Dialogo delle lingue\", 1542) was the expression of the literary principles of the Pléiade as a whole, but although Ronsard was the chosen leader, its redaction was entrusted to du Bellay. This work also bolstered French political debate as a means of learned men to reform their country. To obtain a clear view of the reforms aimed at by the Pléiade, the Defence should be further considered in connection with Ronsard's \"Abrégé d'art poétique\" and his preface to the \"Franciade\". Du Bellay maintained that the French language as it was then constituted was too poor to serve as a medium for the higher forms of poetry, but he contended that by proper cultivation it might be brought on a level with the classical tongues. He condemned those who despaired of their mother tongue, and used Latin for their more serious and ambitious work. For translations from the ancients he would substitute imitations, though he does not in the Defense explain precisely how one is to go about this. Not only were the forms of classical poetry to be imitated, but a separate poetic language and style, distinct from those employed in prose, were to be used. The French language was to be enriched by a development of its internal resources and by discreet borrowing from Italian, Latin and Greek. Both du Bellay and Ronsard laid stress on the necessity of prudence in these borrowings, and both repudiated the charge of wishing to Latinize their mother tongue. The book was a spirited defence of poetry and of the possibilities of the French language; it was also a declaration of war on those writers who held less heroic views.\n\nThe violent attacks made by du Bellay on Marot and his followers, and on Sébillet, did not go unanswered. Sébillet replied in the preface to his translation of the \"Iphigenia\" of Euripides; Guillaume des Autels, a Lyonnese poet, reproached du Bellay with ingratitude to his predecessors, and showed the weakness of his argument for imitation as opposed to translation in a digression in his \"Réplique aux furieuses defenses de Louis Meigret\" (Lyons, 1550); Barthélemy Aneau, regent of the Collège de la Trinité at Lyons, attacked him in his \" Horatian\" (Lyons, 1551), the authorship of which was commonly attributed to Charles Fontaine. Aneau pointed out the obvious inconsistency of inculcating imitation of the ancients and depreciating native poets in a work professing to be a defence of the French language.\n\nDu Bellay replied to his various assailants in a preface to the second edition (1550) of his sonnet sequence \"Olive\", with which he also published two polemical poems, the \"Musagnaeomachie\", and an ode addressed to Ronsard, \"Contre les envieux fioles\". \"Olive\", a collection of sonnets modeled after the poetry of Petrarch, Ariosto, and contemporary Italians published by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari, first appeared in 1549. With it were printed thirteen odes entitled \"Vers lyriques\". \"Olive\" has been supposed to be an anagram for the name of a \"Mlle Viole\", but there is little evidence of real passion in the poems, and they may perhaps be regarded as a Petrarchan exercise, especially as, in the second edition, the dedication to his lady is exchanged for one to Marguerite de Valois, daughter of Henry II. Du Bellay did not actually introduce the sonnet into French poetry, but he acclimatized it; and when the fashion of sonneteering became a mania he was one of the first to ridicule its excesses.\n\nAbout this time du Bellay had a serious illness of two years' duration, from which dates the beginning of his deafness. He had further anxieties in the guardianship of his nephew. The boy died in 1553, and Joachim, who had up to this time borne the title of \"sieur de Liré\", became \"seigneur\" of Gonnor. In 1549 he had published a \"Recueil de poésies\" dedicated to the Princess Marguerite. This was followed in 1552 by a version of the fourth book of the \"Aeneid\", with other translations and some occasional poems.\n\nIn the next year he went to Rome as one of the secretaries of Cardinal du Bellay. To the beginning of his four and a half years' residence in Italy belong the forty-seven sonnets of his \"Antiquités de Rome\", which were rendered into English by Edmund Spenser (\"The Ruins of Rome\", 1591). These sonnets were more personal and less imitative than the Olive sequence, and struck a note which was revived in later French literature by Volney and Chateaubriand. His stay in Rome was, however, a real exile. His duties were those of an attendant. He had to meet the cardinal's creditors and to find money for the expenses of the household. Nevertheless, he found many friends among Italian scholars, and formed a close friendship with another exiled poet whose circumstances were similar to his own, Olivier de Magny.\n\nTowards the end of his sojourn in Rome he fell violently in love with a Roman lady called Faustine, who appears in his poetry as Columba and Columbelle. This passion finds its clearest expression in the Latin poems. Faustine was guarded by an old and jealous husband, and du Bellay's eventual conquest may have had something to do with his departure for Paris at the end of August 1557. In the next year he published the poems he had brought back with him from Rome, the Latin Poemata, the \"Antiquités de Rome\", the \"Divers Jeux Rustiques\", and the 191 sonnets of the \"Regrets\", the greater number of which were written in Italy. The \"Regrets\" show that he had moved away from the theories of the \"Défence\".\n\nThe simplicity and tenderness specially characteristic of du Bellay appear in the sonnets telling of his unlucky passion for Faustine, and of his nostalgia for the banks of the Loire. Among them are some satirical sonnets describing Roman manners, and the later ones written after his return to Paris are often appeals for patronage. His intimate relations with Ronsard were not renewed, but he formed a close friendship with the scholar Jean de Morel, whose house was the centre of a learned society. In 1559 du Bellay published at Poitiers \"La Nouvelle Manière de faire son profit des lettres\", a satirical epistle translated from the Latin of Adrien Turnèbe, and with it \"Le Poète courtisan\", which introduced the formal satire into French poetry. The Nouvelle Manière is believed to be directed at Pierre de Paschal, who was elected as royal historiographer, and who had promised to write Latin biographies of the great, but who in fact never wrote anything of the sort. Both works were published under the pseudonym of J Quintil du Troussay, and the courtier-poet was generally supposed to be Mellin de Saint-Gelais, with whom du Bellay had always, however, been on friendly terms.\n\nA long and eloquent \"Discours au roi\" (detailing the duties of a prince, and translated from a Latin original written by Michel de l'Hôpital, now lost) was dedicated to Francis II in 1559, and is said to have secured for the poet a tardy pension, although it was not published until 1567, after his death. In Paris he was still in the employ of the cardinal, who delegated to him the lay patronage which he still retained in the diocese. In the exercise of these functions Joachim quarrelled with Eustache du Bellay, bishop of Paris, who prejudiced his relations with the cardinal, less cordial since the publication of the outspoken \"Regrets\". His chief patron, Marguerite de Valois, to whom he was sincerely attached, had gone to Savoy. Du Bellay's health was weak; his deafness seriously hindered his official duties; and on 1 January 1560 he died at the age of 38. There is no evidence that he was in priest's orders, but he was a clerk, and as such held various preferments. He had at one time been a canon of Notre Dame of Paris, and was accordingly buried in the cathedral. The statement that he was nominated archbishop of Bordeaux during the last year of life is unauthenticated by documentary evidence and is in itself extremely improbable.\n\nThe best edition of his collected works in French is still that produced by Henri Chamard in six volumes. Also, there are the \"Œuvres francaises\" (2 vols., 1866–1867), edited with introduction and notes by C. Marty-Laveaux in his \"Pléiade française\". His \"Œuvres choisies\" were published by L. Becq de Fouquières in 1876. The chief source of his biography is his own poetry, especially the Latin elegy addressed to Jean de Morel, \"\"Elegia ad Janum Morellum Ebredunensem, Pytadem suum\",\" printed with a volume of Xenia (Paris, 1569). A study of his life and writings by H. Chamard, forming vol. viii. of the \"Travaux et mémoires de l'université de Lille\" (Lute, 1900), contains all the available information and corrects many common errors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15993", "title": "John Napier", "text": "John Napier\n\nJohn Napier of Merchiston (; 1550 – 4 April 1617); also signed as Neper, Nepair; nicknamed Marvellous Merchiston) was a Scottish landowner known as a mathematician, physicist, and astronomer. He was the 8th Laird of Merchiston. His Latinized name was Ioannes Neper.\n\nJohn Napier is best known as the discoverer of logarithms. He also invented the so-called \"Napier's bones\" and made common the use of the decimal point in arithmetic and mathematics.\n\nNapier's birthplace, Merchiston Tower in Edinburgh, is now part of the facilities of Edinburgh Napier University. Napier died from the effects of gout at home at Merchiston Castle and his remains were buried in the kirkyard of St Giles. Following the loss of the kirkyard there to build Parliament House, he was memorialised at St Cuthbert's at the west side of Edinburgh.\n\nNapier's father was Sir Archibald Napier of Merchiston Castle, and his mother was Janet Bothwell, daughter of the politician and judge Francis Bothwell, Lord of Session, and a sister of Adam Bothwell who became the Bishop of Orkney. Archibald Napier was 16 years old when John Napier was born.\n\nAs was the common practice for members of the nobility at that time, he was privately tutored and did not have formal education until he was 13, when he was sent to St Salvator's College, St Andrews. \n\nHe did not stay in college very long. It is believed that he dropped out of school in Scotland and perhaps travelled in mainland Europe to better continue his studies. Little is known about those years, where, when, or with whom he might have studied, although his uncle Adam Bothwell wrote a letter to John's father on 5 December 1560, saying \"I pray you, sir, to send John to the schools either to France or Flanders, for he can learn no good at home\", and it is believed that this advice was followed.\n\nIn 1571, Napier, aged 21, returned to Scotland, and bought a castle at Gartness in 1574. On the death of his father in 1608, Napier and his family moved into Merchiston Castle in Edinburgh, where he resided the remainder of his life. He died at the age of 67.\n\nMany mathematicians at the time were acutely aware of the issues of computation and were dedicated to relieving practitioners of the calculation burden. In particular, the Scottish mathematician John Napier was famous for his devices to assist with computation. He invented a well-known mathematical artifact, the ingenious numbering rods more quaintly known as “Napier's bones,” that offered mechanical means for facilitating computation. (For additional information on “Napier's bones,” see the article, “John Napier: His Life, His Logs, and His Bones” (2006).) \n\nIn addition, Napier recognized the potential of the recent developments in mathematics, particularly those of prosthaphaeresis, decimal fractions, and symbolic index arithmetic, to tackle the issue of reducing computation. He appreciated that, for the most part, practitioners who had laborious computations generally did them in the context of trigonometry. Therefore, as well as developing the logarithmic relation, Napier set it in a trigonometric context so it would be even more relevant.\n\nHis work, \"Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio\" (1614) contained fifty-seven pages of explanatory matter and ninety pages of tables of numbers related to natural logarithms (see Napierian logarithm). The book also has an excellent discussion of theorems in spherical trigonometry, usually known as Napier's Rules of Circular Parts.\n\nModern English translations of both Napier's books on logarithms and their description can be found on the web, as well as a discussion of Napier's Bones (see below) and Promptuary (another early calculating device). \n\nHis invention of logarithms was quickly taken up at Gresham College, and prominent English mathematician Henry Briggs visited Napier in 1615. Among the matters they discussed were a re-scaling of Napier's logarithms, in which the presence of the mathematical constant now known as \"e\" (more accurately, \"e\" times a large power of 10 rounded to an integer) was a practical difficulty. Neither Napier nor Briggs actually discovered the constant \"e\"; that discovery was made decades later by Jacob Bernoulli.\n\nNapier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table. The computational advance available via logarithms, the converse of powered numbers or exponential notation, was such that it made calculations by hand much quicker. The way was opened to later scientific advances, in astronomy, dynamics, and other areas of physics.\n\nNapier made further contributions. He improved Simon Stevin's decimal notation. Lattice multiplication, used by Fibonacci, was made more convenient by his introduction of Napier's bones, a multiplication tool using a set of numbered rods.\n\nNapier may have worked largely in isolation, but he had contact with Tycho Brahe who corresponded with his friend John Craig. Craig certainly announced the discovery of logarithms to Brahe in the 1590s (the name itself came later); there is a story from Anthony à Wood, perhaps not well substantiated, that Napier had a hint from Craig that Longomontanus, a follower of Brahe, was working in a similar direction. \n\nIt has been shown that Craig had notes on a method of Paul Wittich that used trigonometric identities to reduce a multiplication formula for the sine function to additions.\n\nNapier had an interest in the \"Book of Revelation\", from his student days at St Salvator's College, St Andrews. Under the influence of the sermons of Christopher Goodman, he developed a strongly anti-papal reading. He further used the \"Book of Revelation\" for chronography, to predict the Apocalypse, in \"A Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of St. John\" (1593), which he regarded as his most important work; he also applied the Sibylline Oracles, to calculate the date of the end of the world. Napier believed that would occur in 1688 or 1700. He dated the seventh trumpet to 1541.\n\nIn his dedication of the \"Plaine Discovery\" to James VI, dated 29 Jan 1594, Napier urged the king to see \"that justice be done against the enemies of God's church,\" and counselled the King \"to reform the universal enormities of his country, and first to begin at his own house, family, and court.\" The volume includes nine pages of Napier's English verse. It met with success at home and abroad. In 1600 Michiel Panneel produced a Dutch translation, and this reached a second edition in 1607. In 1602 the work appeared at La Rochelle in a French version, by Georges Thomson, revised by Napier, and that also went through several editions (1603, 1605, and 1607). A new edition of the English original was called for in 1611, when it was revised and corrected by the author, and enlarged by the addition of \"With a resolution of certain doubts, moved by some well affected brethren.\"; this appeared simultaneously at Edinburgh and London. The author stated that he still intended to publish a Latin edition, but it never appeared. A German translation, by Leo de Dromna, of the first part of Napier's work appeared at Gera in 1611, and of the whole by Wolfgang Meyer at Frankfurt-am-Main, in 1615. Among Napier's followers was Matthew Cotterius (Matthieu Cottière).\n\nIn addition to his mathematical and religious interests, Napier was often perceived as a magician, and is thought to have dabbled in alchemy and necromancy. It was said that he would travel about with a black spider in a small box, and that his black rooster was his familiar spirit.\n\nA contract still exists for a treasure hunt, made between Napier and Robert Logan of Restalrig. Napier was to search Fast Castle for treasure allegedly hidden there, wherein it is stated that Napier should \"do his utmost diligence to search and seek out, and by all craft and ingine to find out the same, or make it sure that no such thing has been there.\"\n\nAmong Napier's early followers were the instrument makers Edmund Gunter and John Speidell. The development of logarithms is given credit as the largest single factor in the general adoption of decimal arithmetic. The \"Trissotetras\" (1645) of Thomas Urquhart builds on Napier's work, in trigonometry.\n\nAn alternative unit to the decibel used in electrical engineering, the neper, is named after Napier, as is Edinburgh Napier University in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nThe crater Neper on the Moon is named after him.\n\nIn 1572, Napier married 16-year-old Elizabeth, daughter of James Stirling, the 4th Laird of Keir and of Cadder. They had two children. Elizabeth died in 1579, and Napier then married Agnes Chisholm, with whom he had ten more children. His father-in-law James Chisholm of Cromlix was later mixed up in the Spanish blanks plot, over which Napier with others petitioned the king.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "556393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=556393", "title": "Kenneth Arnold", "text": "Kenneth Arnold\n\nKenneth Albert Arnold (March 29, 1915 – January 16, 1984) was an American aviator and businessman. He is best known for making what is generally considered the first widely reported modern unidentified flying object sighting in the United States, after claiming to have seen nine unusual objects flying in tandem near Mount Rainier, Washington on June 24, 1947.\n\nArnold was born in Sebeka, Minnesota, but grew up in Scobey, Montana. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he was coached in football by Bernie Bierman. He was an avid swimmer and diver being good enough at the latter to try out for the U.S. Diving team.\n\nArnold began Great Western Fire Control Supply in Boise, Idaho in 1940, a company that sold and installed fire suppression systems, a job that took him around the Pacific Northwest.\n\nArnold was regarded as a skilled and experienced pilot, with over 9,000 total flying hours, almost half of which were devoted to Search and Rescue Mercy Flyer efforts.\n\nHe ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of Idaho in 1962.\n\nOn June 24, 1947, while flying near Mt. Rainier in Washington State, Arnold claimed to have seen nine unusual objects flying in the skies. Arnold also claimed to have seen UFOs on several subsequent occasions.\n\nArnold originally described the objects' shape as \"flat like a pie pan\", \"shaped like a pie plate\", \"half-moon shaped, oval in front and convex in the rear\", \"something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear\", or simply \"saucer-like\" or \"like a big flat disk\" (see quotes), and also described their erratic motion being \"like a fish flipping in the sun\" or a saucer skipped across water. From these, the press quickly coined the new terms \"flying saucer\" and \"flying disc\" to describe such objects, many of which were reported within days after Arnold's sighting. Later Arnold would add that one of the objects actually resembled a crescent or flying wing.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force formally listed the Arnold case as a mirage; this is one of many explanations that have been disputed by critics, and researchers Jerome Clark, author of \"The UFO Book\" (1998) and Ronald Story, editor of \"The Encyclopedia of UFOs\" (1980). Both argue that there has never been an entirely persuasive conventional explanation of the Arnold sighting.\n\nAfter his UFO sighting, Arnold became a minor celebrity, and for about a decade thereafter, he was somewhat involved in interviewing other UFO witnesses or contactees. Notably, he investigated the claims of Samuel Eaton Thompson, one of the first contactees. Arnold wrote a book and several magazine articles about his UFO sighting and his subsequent research.\n\nBy the 1960s, Arnold had tired of his noteriety and UFOs in general, and he eventually declined all interviews. On June 24, 1977, however, he attended the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, curated by \"Fate\" to mark the 30th anniversary of the \"birth\" of the modern UFO age. Some of his comments at the event reflected his displeasure at the general ignorance concerning the matter:\n\nArnold and his wife Doris had four daughters, Kiska, Karla, Kim (Purvis) and April Katri. He died, aged 68, from colon cancer at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, Washington per his bio. Arnold did not practice any organized religion, and he was in the habit of handing out a \"philosophy card\" which seemed to exalt the virtues of the \"unbeliever\". His daughter Kim would however explain later that this merely implied his belief in questioning dogma and his support for independent decision making. In her view his belief in a divine creator caused him to defend the authenticity of his sighting of June 24, 1947, until his death. \n\nThe actual CallAir A-2 airplane which Kenneth Arnold was piloting when he made his famous UFO sighting back in 1947 still exists. It is currently at the North Cascade Vintage Aircraft Museum in Concrete, Washington and is still in excellent flying condition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24189541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24189541", "title": "Kurt Hummel", "text": "Kurt Hummel\n\nKurt Hummel is a fictional character and one of the male leads in the Fox musical comedy-drama series \"Glee\". Series creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan initially conceived of him as a fashionable gay countertenor who is routinely bullied at school. Kurt is portrayed by actor Chris Colfer, and has appeared as a character on the show since its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. \"Glee\" follows the trials of the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of Lima, Ohio, of which Kurt is a member. His storylines in the first season focus on his struggle with his sexual identity as he discloses his homosexuality to his father and friends, and deals with his romantic feelings for Finn Hudson, the heterosexual co-captain of the glee club.\n\nIn the show's second season, Kurt is forced to transfer to a private school for his own safety after a closeted classmate bullies him relentlessly and then threatens to kill him. Kurt joins the Dalton Academy Warblers, the school's glee club, which is a competition rival of New Directions, and is befriended by their openly gay lead singer Blaine Anderson. Later on, the two become romantically involved. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named \"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\" by Jarett Wieselman of the \"New York Post\". Kurt eventually transfers back to McKinley and rejoins New Directions, but continues his relationship with Blaine, who transfers to McKinley in the third season. In the fourth season, Kurt moves to New York City with his best friend and rival Rachel Berry, where he pursues his musical education while interning for Vogue.com. For the remainder of the series, \"Glee\" charts Kurt's life in Lima and New York as he grapples with young adulthood and realising his career ambitions.\n\nColfer describes Kurt as projecting a very confident \"I'm better than you\" personality, despite being a typically scared and anxious teenager. Kurt's solos for New Directions tend to be songs—usually show tunes—traditionally performed by women, which best suit his countertenor voice. His occasionally complex—but always loving—relationship with his father has been a focus for the show. Colfer's portrayal of Kurt has received much critical praise, and he has been the recipient of several awards, including Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards. He has also garnered many award nominations, which include the 2010 and 2011 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. In April 2011, Colfer was named one of the 2011 Time 100, \"Time\"'s list of the 100 most influential people.\n\nPrior to being cast in \"Glee\", Colfer had no professional acting experience. He originally auditioned for the role of Artie Abrams, performing \"Mr. Cellophane\" from the musical \"Chicago\". Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show. Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from \"The Sound of Music\", a role that Colfer once played as a child. The Hummel surname comes from the popular German Hummel figurines; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion. Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, \"I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual. I've never seen anyone who looks like him or acts like him or sounds like him. You'd think he’d been at Juilliard for six years but he hasn't.\" Murphy saw something of himself in the young actor, a fact that Colfer says is \"completely mind-blowing\". Colfer added, \"For him to see me in him, I can't even describe it.\"\n\nAfter being cast, Colfer said that he was happy \"to be a part of something that is so new and different and so needed at this time\", and added, \"It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, who need a little pick-me-up.\" Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode \"Grilled Cheesus\", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin. Although Kolkin was thirteen at the time of the audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was \"so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback\". Kurt has also been shown even younger—in the episode \"The Substitute\", club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children.\n\nIn December 2010, Murphy announced that the cast of \"Glee\" would be replaced at the end of the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, \"Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot.\" He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: \"I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives.\" Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving at the end of the third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, \"We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming.\" However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation did not mean that they would leave the show. Falchuk insisted that \"it was never our plan or our intention to let them go... They are not done with the show after this season.\"\n\nIn the show's pilot episode, Kurt auditions for the New Directions glee club by performing \"Mr. Cellophane\" from \"Chicago\". Although he initially hides his homosexuality, many of the other members assume he is gay. He confides that he is gay to fellow glee club member Mercedes (Amber Riley) in \"Acafellas\", and the two develop a close friendship. In the following episode, \"Preggers\", Kurt joins the school football team as a kicker in order to impress his widowed father, Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), and helps the failing team win its first game by kicking the tie-breaking extra point. His heightened confidence leads him to disclose his homosexuality to his father, who not only responds with love and acceptance, but also surprises Kurt by telling him that he has long been aware that Kurt was gay. Kurt quits the football team in \"Mash-Up\", when Coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) forces the glee club members of the team to choose between the club and the team.\n\nKurt competes against the glee club's star singer Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) for a solo on \"Defying Gravity\" from the musical \"Wicked\". However, after Burt receives a phone call labeling his son \"a fag\", Kurt intentionally misses the song's high note in order to lose the competition and save his father from further harassment. In the episode \"Ballad\", Kurt is teamed with club member and quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), for whom he harbors romantic feelings. He is aware that Rachel is also attracted to Finn, and attempts to sabotage her chances with him by giving her a bad makeover. In \"The Power of Madonna\", Kurt and Mercedes, dissatisfied with their limited solo opportunities within the glee club, become singers for the school's cheerleading squad, the Cheerios. Although Mercedes soon resigns from the squad, Kurt stays through the National cheerleading competition, and performs a major solo in the routine that wins the Cheerios their sixth consecutive national championship.\n\nKurt introduces his father to Finn's mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) in the hope that if the two began dating, it would bring Kurt closer to Finn. Finn is initially unhappy when he finds out his mother is in a serious relationship, but he soon bonds with Burt over sports and other traditionally masculine activities. Kurt, who becomes jealous over their growing relationship, briefly attempts to reclaim his father's attention by acting more masculine: he imitates Burt's style of dress, asks him for advice on performing songs by his favorite artist, John Mellencamp, and arranges to have Burt walk in on him kissing cheerleader and glee club member Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris). In the episode \"Theatricality\", Burt invites Carole and Finn to move in with him and Kurt. Aware of Kurt's attraction to him, Finn is uncomfortable with sharing a bedroom with Kurt. In the hopes of pleasing Finn, Kurt redecorates their bedroom, but Finn is appalled by its fancy appearance and lack of privacy. During the ensuing argument, when Kurt refuses to acknowledge his infatuation, Finn loses his temper and calls the new furnishings \"faggy\". Burt overhears Finn's words, angrily berates Finn, and throws him out. However, at the end of the episode, when two bullies are about to attack Kurt, Finn redeems himself by defending him.\n\nBurt suffers a heart attack early in the second season. He is comatose for several days, and Kurt is terrified that he might lose him. When members of the glee club sing religious songs to comfort him, Kurt, who does not believe in God, feels alienated, and lashes out at them. Burt eventually regains consciousness, and Kurt takes charge of his recovery. In the episode \"Duets\", Kurt suspects new glee club member and transfer student Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is gay and recruits Sam to be his teammate in the club's duets competition. Finn attempts to dissuade Kurt from partnering with Sam by predicting that Sam will be bullied to the point of quitting the club if he sings a duet with another male student. After Burt points out that Kurt may be taking advantage of Sam, Kurt terminates the partnership, and performs a \"duet\" with himself, singing \"Le Jazz Hot!\" from \"Victor Victoria\". With unusual empathy, Rachel notices how lonely and unhappy Kurt seems, and realizes how hard it is for him to be the only publicly gay student at school. She reminds Kurt that the club members value him highly and that he is not alone, and asks him to sing the Judy Garland / Barbra Streisand duet of \"Get Happy\" and \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" with her.\nIn \"Never Been Kissed\", Kurt goes to spy on the Dalton Academy glee club, the Warblers—New Directions' primary competition for Sectionals—and meets openly gay student Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), who then flirts with him while singing lead in a Warblers performance of \"Teenage Dream\". Kurt tells Blaine that he is being tormented by a homophobic bully at his high school, and Blaine convinces him to stand up for himself. When the bully, Dave Karofsky, throws Kurt against a locker, Kurt confronts him, and an increasingly agitated Karofsky abruptly grabs Kurt and kisses him. Before Karofsky can initiate a second kiss, Kurt shoves him away. Kurt and Blaine try to talk to Karofsky about being gay and closeted, but he denies the kiss. The bullying intensifies, and Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt if Kurt reveals their kiss to anyone. After Burt learns about Karofsky's threat to his son, Karofsky is expelled. Burt and Carole get married, but when Karofsky's expulsion is reversed by the school board, the newlyweds decide to spend the money they had saved for their honeymoon on tuition to transfer Kurt to Dalton Academy, which enforces a zero-tolerance policy against bullying.\n\nAt Dalton, Kurt joins the Warblers. When the Warblers and New Directions meet at the show choir Sectionals competition, they tie for first place, making both groups eligible for Regionals. Kurt and Blaine become good friends, and Kurt soon falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine is initially oblivious to Kurt's regard. However, in the episode \"Original Song\", Blaine realizes his true feelings for Kurt, and they share a kiss. To Kurt's disappointment, the Warblers lose to New Directions at the Regionals competition. He transfers back to McKinley in \"Born This Way\" after Karofsky starts an anti-bullying club with glee club member Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), and personally assures Kurt that he regrets his earlier threats.\n\nKurt invites Blaine to the McKinley junior prom in \"Prom Queen\". The attendees greet Karofsky's election as Prom King with great enthusiasm, but a stunned silence falls when Kurt is declared Prom Queen due to having received an overwhelming number of unwanted write-in votes in the secret balloting. Humiliated, Kurt flees in tears, but is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—\"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton\"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. The traditional dance between King and Queen is next, and Karofsky is faced with having to partner with a boy in front of his classmates. He rejects Kurt's suggestion to come out at the prom, and abandons Kurt on the dance floor as the music begins; Blaine dances with Kurt instead. At the end of the season, the glee club travels to the Nationals competition in New York City. Kurt and Rachel sneak into the Gershwin Theatre where \"Wicked\" is playing, and from the stage they sing \"For Good\", a song from the musical. They both decide to come back to New York after graduation. New Directions finishes in twelfth place at Nationals, and upon Kurt's return to Ohio, he and Blaine declare their love for one another.\n\nBlaine gives in to Kurt's urgings and wishes and transfers to McKinley High so they can spend more time together during Kurt's senior year. Kurt and Rachel decide they want to apply to a top school for the dramatic arts in New York City, NYADA, but are intimidated when they meet some of their competition and decide their applications need to include more accomplishments: Rachel proposes that McKinley do \"West Side Story\" as the school musical so she can star in it, and Kurt runs for class president. Brittany volunteers to be his campaign manager, and he accepts, but when he objects to her suggestions for posters and paraphernalia as overemphasizing his sexuality, she decides to run for the office herself. Kurt tries out for the musical, but the directors aren't convinced that he's masculine enough to portray Tony, the romantic male lead, and cast Blaine instead, even though he's only a junior; Kurt is given the minor role of Officer Krupke. When Rachel believes that she might not be cast as Maria, the female lead, she panics and decides to run for class president as well, infuriating Kurt. She eventually withdraws and throws her support behind Kurt, and secretly decides to help him further by stuffing the ballot box in his favor. He nevertheless loses to Brittany, and Rachel is suspended from school for cheating. The same day that Kurt loses, his father wins a special congressional election against Sue.\n\nIn \"The First Time\", Kurt and Blaine discuss whether or not to have sex. When Blaine goes to Dalton to invite the Warblers to see him in \"West Side Story\", he is pursued by a new warbler Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin). Sebastian convinces Kurt and Blaine to go with him to a local gay bar—he supplies the fake IDs—and spends half the night dancing with Blaine. When they leave, a drunk and aroused Blaine urges Kurt to have sex with him in the back seat of the car. Kurt refuses, and Blaine walks home. He later tells Kurt that he was just nervous about the possibility of their first time, and that he cares nothing for Sebastian. They kiss onstage in the empty auditorium, and Kurt proposes that they go over to Blaine's house for the night, where they have sex together for the first time. In the episode \"Michael\", New Directions and the Warblers compete for the right to perform Michael Jackson's music at Regionals by singing his song \"Bad\". Sebastian, who has been unsuccessful in his attempts to steal Blaine from Kurt, throws a slushie laced with rock salt at Kurt, but Blaine jumps in front of Kurt and is badly injured by it; the cornea in his right eye is deeply scratched and requires surgery. Neither group ultimately uses Jackson's music at Regionals, and New Directions wins the competition. Later, Kurt succeeds in becoming a finalist for NYADA, as does Rachel.\n\nIn \"Dance with Somebody\", Kurt feels that Blaine has been distant, and confides in a boy named Chandler he meets at the local music store. The two hit it off instantly with their common interest of moving to New York after high school. Kurt begins texting Chandler quite often soon after that. Rachel thinks he's being in the wrong that Kurt is cheating on Blaine instead of talking to Blaine about the rut they are in. Blaine finds out about Chandler and is extremely hurt. Both Kurt and Blaine sing Whitney songs to express how they feel about their situation with Blaine singing It's Not Right but It's Okay and Kurt singing I Have Nothing as an apology. Eventually after having a talk in Emma's office, the two make up and are stronger than ever. In \"Goodbye\", Blaine is worried that he and Kurt will not make it as a couple after Kurt graduates and moves off to New York. Kurt reassures him that they will be okay as a couple. After graduation, Kurt, Rachel and Finn's letters from the New York schools they applied to come in. Kurt does not get accepted to NYADA.\n\nIn Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York after she reveals that she is unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the encouragement of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.\n\nKurt continues working at Vogue throughout the season, and Isabelle encourages him to try to forgive Blaine, and at Thanksgiving, she brings her friends over to their loft and throws him a \"kiki.\" When Kurt reauditions for NYADA, he is initially rejected, because Carmen Tibideaux sees his technical skill and tells him that he can sell a number, but doesn't believe that he is emotional enough to be an artist. Later, when Kurt is at the Winter Showcase to support Rachel, she sees him moved by Rachel's piece, and announces that he will be auditioning after the intermission. Though he initially panics, Rachel convinces him that he doesn't need his bells and whistles to perform, and he chooses to sing \"Being Alive\" from Company, which impresses the NYADA audience, and he later gets a letter telling him that he has gotten in.\n\nAt Christmas, Kurt elects not to go back home, and so his father comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and spend some time with him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has prostate cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.\n\nWhen Santana moves in with him and Rachel, Kurt tries to keep Santana from telling Rachel about Brody prostituting himself. But Santana tells Rachel anyway, much to Kurt's dismay. Later, Kurt and Rachel confront Santana for working at a club dancing and try to encourage her to take a dance class from the extension school of NYADA to keep her skills honed. Still working at Vogue, Kurt is put in charge of a ballet gala, and invites Rachel and Santana to help. He and Rachel reveal that they both had experiences with ballet as children, and Kurt started ballet at the age of three years when his mother decided to take him. He bribes Santana to go with a designer dress, and once they are at the gala, she admits she was in ballet as a child too and loved it. When Kurt returns to Lima, it is to be there for his father's doctor's visit, and his anxiety is apparent throughout his interactions with his friends. However, in the doctor's office, Kurt, Burt, and Carole learn that Burt's cancer has gone into remission, and Kurt takes his father to the Glee club to sing \"Sunshine of My Life\" to him, which Kurt says Burt used to sing to him when he was little.\n\nIn the season premiere, \"Love, Love, Love\", Kurt, who is still in Lima, agrees to get back together with Blaine. Emboldened, Blaine decides to ask Kurt to marry him, which he does in an extravagant proposal at Dalton Academy, in the spot where the two met. Kurt accepts. He is back in New York in \"Tina in the Sky with Diamonds\", and gets a job at the diner where Rachel and Santana are working. He then returns to Lima in \"The Quarterback\" for his stepbrother Finn's funeral and subsequent memorial, and he grieves with his parents and friends.\n\nKurt was still living in New York, but he was visiting his father in Lima\n\nDuring the season, Kurt and Blaine have broken up but eventually reunite in time for Brittany and Santana's wedding. At the two's insistence, Kurt and Blaine get married alongside them. In 2020, they are still married and are a celebrity couple. Rachel is pregnant with their child who is assumed to be a girl.\n\nAccording to Colfer, \"Glee\"s creators initially \"were leaning on [Kurt] being overly flamboyant\". However, the actor stated that he did not want to take that approach \"because it's so overdone\". Instead, he decided to portray the character as \"more internal and superior.\" Colfer has explained that Kurt \"puts on a very confident, 'I'm better than you' persona,\" but that \"underneath it all he's the same anxious and scared teen everyone is/was at some point.\" Colfer also commented, \"In later episodes, [Kurt] goes through an identity crisis, accepting and finding acceptance for who he is. He's a tough guy in designer clothes.\" In contrasting Kurt to his own personality, Colfer stated that Kurt is \"very flamboyant and superior and uppity and into fashion\", while Colfer had never heard of fashion designer Marc Jacobs before Kurt referenced him in the pilot episode. The second-season episode \"Grilled Cheesus\" centered around Kurt's atheism, with Murphy explaining that Kurt is \"saying to the world, 'Prove [me] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.\n\nKurt reveals himself to be gay early in the show's first season. The scene in which he tells his father was taken verbatim from Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was \"a great thing to put on television\", because, while gay characters are often isolated and attacked, audiences have rarely seen an openly gay character who \"wins and triumphs\". He further explained, \"The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism and the power of your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I've done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough.\" Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt \"honest\" and not comical or \"used as a punchline\". He explained, \"I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV.\"\n\nKurt’s acute sense of fashion is exhibited in his on-screen wardrobe. \"Glee\"s costume designer Lou Eyrich said in an interview with the \"Seattle Times\" that Kurt is one of her favorite characters to dress: \"He never, ever repeats and you get to push yourself creatively. He's a perfect doll to dress because he'll try on anything.\" Eyrich sets out to dress Kurt with tailored pieces that \"exude his quietly flashy dapper dandyism\", mindful that as the son of a car mechanic, \"he doesn't have a lot of money\".\n\nKurt has a close relationship with his father Burt, who openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, \"Preggers\". As the series progresses their relationship continues to grow stronger. Colfer has credited his off-screen relationship with O'Malley with improving the quality of their scenes together. Kurt has twice fallen in love. The first occurrence is initially alluded to in the episode \"Acafellas\", in which Kurt tells his friend Mercedes that he does have feelings for someone. Mercedes mistakenly assumes that Rachel, the glee club's lead singer, is the object of Kurt's affections, and although he later tells Mercedes that he is gay, he does not reveal to her that he is actually in love with the club's male lead, Finn. After Kurt hints to Finn of his attraction, their friendship becomes strained as Finn resists Kurt's machinations to get them together. The episode in which Burt defends his son against Finn's name-calling prompted a response from Eric Goldman of \"IGN\", who declared it \"one of the heaviest scenes \"Glee\" has ever delved into\".\n\nBefore production on the second season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest. According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest. However, Sam's storyline was later adjusted to pair him with glee club member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) after producers observed the chemistry between Overstreet and Agron. Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, a member of the rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, \"Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of the middle of the season.\" Kurt transfers from McKinley High to Dalton Academy and falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine only considers him a close friend. However, when Kurt sings the Beatles song \"Blackbird\" in \"Original Song\", Blaine finally realizes his true feelings and the two kiss, marking the start of the relationship. Criss noted, \"We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up.\" When imagining Blaine and Kurt's potential future together, Murphy expected to treat them the same as all other \"Glee\" relationships by making their pairing \"as flawed and as exposed as everyone else's.\" This plan was confirmed by Falchuk after the characters kissed for the first time, though he later clarified: \"They're solid. They have problems—you have two stars dating each other, there's going to be some competition there.\" In the second-season finale, they each tell the other, \"I love you\", and early in the third season they decide to have sex for the first time. The Kurt–Blaine relationship has been well received by critics, and they were named \"one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium\" late in the second season by Jarett Wieselman of the \"New York Post\".\n\nIn a July 2012 interview with \"E! News\", Colfer elaborated in regard to the progression of the Kurt-Blaine relationship in the show's fourth season. Colfer said, \"I would like to do something besides say 'I love you,' and I think Darren [Criss] and I agree on that. We're ready for the next step. They've been together for a while. Let's throw some spice and drama into that.\" In September 2012, Criss echoed Colfer's sentiment, \"We're like an old married couple now. Let's shake it up!\"\n\nTo begin the show's fourth season, Kurt moves to New York while Blaine continues to go to high school in Ohio, though he and Blaine remain a couple. However, after Blaine cheats on him, Kurt breaks up with Blaine. The two later agree to remain friends, though Kurt is unwilling to resume their relationship. That winter, Kurt begins to see Adam Crawford, a senior at his new school, NYADA. Despite this, Kurt has sex with Blaine when in Ohio to attend a wedding, putting into question whether Kurt still wants to be with Blaine.\n\nDespite all this, Kurt and Blaine do get back together in a romantic relationship in the first episode of the fifth season, \"Love Love Love\", which is incidentally the same episode that Blaine proposes marriage. Kurt says yes immediately.\n\nKurt heads back to New York while Blaine finishes high school back in Lima. Eventually, midway through the fifth season, Blaine graduates and moves in with Kurt. They have difficulties and agree that it would be best for them to continue with their engagement but as Blaine lives somewhere else for now as they both need their space. They will cohabitate in the season five finale.\n\nAt the beginning for the sixth season, it seems as though Kurt and Blaine have broken off the engagement due to difficulties living together and Blaine has moved back to Lima. Kurt later regrets this and decides to continue his schooling in Lima, to try to win Blaine back.\n\nWhen Kurt returns, he finds that Blaine is in a relationship with Karofsky. Despite everything that goes on in the beginning of the sixth season, Kurt and Blaine get back together in the beginning of the episode, \"A Wedding\". Later in the same episode, Brittany and Sue Sylvester persuade the couple to get married at Brittany and Santana's wedding to make a double gay wedding.\n\nThey continue through the rest of the sixth season as a wed couple and in the season six finale, \"Dreams Come True\", it is revealed that five years in the future, Rachel is carrying their child, a daughter.\n\nAs Kurt, Colfer features in many songs that have been released as singles available for digital download and are also included in the show's soundtrack albums. In the episode \"Wheels\", Kurt performs \"Defying Gravity\" from the Broadway musical \"Wicked\". Murphy selected \"Defying Gravity\" for the episode after Colfer related a story in which his own high school drama teacher had refused him the opportunity to perform the song because it was written to be sung by a female singer. Murphy explained, \"I found a way to write it into the show because that's in a nutshell what this show is about: someone being told that they can't do something because of what the perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is.\" Colfer stated that the opportunity to sing the song \"meant the world\" to him, and that \"it's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a long time. I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance. Although I do some very 'Kurtsy' things in the song, it's probably one of the most honest and close-to-heart scenes I've ever filmed or performed for that matter.\" Colfer's recording of the performance was released as a single, as well as two additional versions—one sung by co-star Michele, and another that was arranged as a duet for the two singers. The duet version charted at number thirty-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and was included on the show's first soundtrack album, \"\".\nIn \"Grilled Cheesus\", when members of the glee club are singing songs about religion and spirituality, Kurt sings The Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", dedicating the song to his father, who is in a coma in the hospital. Murphy stated that it would have been easy to have Kurt, an atheist, sing an anti-religion song, but instead chose to have him sing about love. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of this song choice. Anthony Benigno of the \"Daily News\" said he \"found it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing 'I wanna be your man' about his father\", but Jessica Derschowitz of \"CBS News\" and \"MTV\" Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" brought new meaning to the song, which Semigran named her favorite number of the episode. In \"Special Education\", when given his first opportunity to audition for a Warblers solo, Kurt asks Rachel for advice on selecting a song and she recommends \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" from \"Evita\"; the episode cuts between the two as they each sing the song. Both Colfer's and Michele's versions were released as singles, available for digital download, although neither appears on an album. Kurt and Blaine perform the duet \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" during the Christmas-oriented episode \"A Very Glee Christmas\". The number was released on \"\", and although it was not also released as a single, it nevertheless reached number fifty-seven on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. As a Dalton Academy Warbler, Kurt sings the harmony line to Blaine's lead in \"Animal\" by Neon Trees in the episode \"Sexy\", and in \"Original Song\" he sings \"Blackbird\" by The Beatles. He also sings primary lead in a duet version of \"Candles\" by Hey Monday, with Blaine as the other lead. All three songs were included on the soundtrack \"\", released on April 19, 2011.\n\nColfer's performances have been well received by critics, particularly \"As If We Never Said Goodbye\" in the episode \"Born This Way\". Meghan Brown of \"The Atlantic\" stated that the song was \"absolutely stunning in every conceivable way\". She thought that he had the emotional connection, the musicality, and the storytelling ability \"down pat\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" Sandra Gonzalez also praised the rendition: \"Kurt apparently picked up a few helpful notes ... from his Warbler brothers and emerged an even better solo singer than I recall. ... Most enjoyable, however, was a tenderness Kurt added to the song that I don't think could have been duplicated by any other member of this ensemble.\" In his review, Michael Slezak of \"TVLine\" commended Kurt's voice and gave the song an \"A\": \"I feel like we haven’t had too many strong musical moments from Kurt this season, but this number, which pushed Chris Colfer’s countertenor to impressive heights, went a long way to erase the deficit.\" \"Rolling Stone\" Erica Futterman wrote that it was \"a sweeter moment than last season's 'Rose's Turn', but the high notes and big vocals are still there\".\n\nKurt has received mainly positive reviews from television critics. James Poniewozik, writing for \"Time\", deemed his coming out \"beautifully handled\" and praised the series for subverting expectations with Burt's acceptance. Rick Bentley of \"McClatchy Newspapers\" praised Colfer's performance in the episode \"Home\" and deemed him deserving of an Emmy nomination. \"IGN\" Robert Canning noted that \"Grilled Cheesus\", which focuses on Kurt's atheism and his father's heart attack, showed again that the Hummels' relationship was \"the most affecting\" of the show. Poniewozik appreciated the focus on Kurt and Burt in the episode and also named their relationship one of \"Glee\" \"strongest and most nuanced relationships\". The primary criticism by \"CNN\" Lisa Respers France of that episode was that it appeared to be an Emmy submission showpiece for Colfer. She said that \"Grilled Cheesus\" felt forced and disliked Kurt's angry \"overwrought\" reaction to his friends' prayers. Christie Keith, writing for the lesbian and bisexual media website \"AfterEllen.com\", praised Kurt's storylines and suggested that Colfer should win an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Kurt dealing with his identity.\n\nCritics were polarized by Kurt's storyline in the episode \"Never Been Kissed\". \"NPR\" Linda Holmes found it \"absurd\" that a teenager as deeply in denial as Karofsky would transition from bullying to kissing Kurt so quickly and described it as \"emotionally and behaviorally unsound\". Leah Anthony Libresco of the \"Huffington Post\" called the episode \"extraordinarily counterproductive\", and disapproved of Will treating Kurt's upset as the key problem, rather than the unchecked bullying provoking it. She found Blaine's advice to Kurt \"misleading and dangerous\", especially the suggestion that targeted children should be held responsible for confronting their attackers and putting themselves at risk of further injury, rather than for protecting themselves. Poniewozik noted that the storyline was inherently flawed, as the show had previously treated bullying in a light-hearted rather than serious manner, but said that its saving grace was the focus it placed on Colfer: \"probably the strongest actor with the most interesting character among the \"Glee\" kids\".\n\nThe love story involving Kurt and Blaine was met with critical acclaim, especially the events in the \"Original Song\" episode where the characters first kissed. Katie Morgan of \"Billboard\" stated, \"It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy.\" The \"Boston Herald\" Mark Perigard wrote, \"It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold the hell out of the moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery.\" Kevin Fallon of \"The Atlantic\" thought the kiss was \"sweet\" and said that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Semigran praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, and characterized the kiss scene as a \"sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment\". She went on to commend the acting in the scene, and wrote that both actors \"handled it with dignity and honesty\".\n\nCritics were enthusiastic about Kurt and Blaine's decision to have sex for the first time in \"The First Time\" episode. Canning said that Kurt and Blaine's \"attempts to get a little wild\", and \"trying to grow up faster than they should\", were \"the better parts of the episode as they felt the most realistic\". Futterman praised their departure from the bar as a \"very faithful and honest scene\". Crystal Bell of \"HuffPost TV\" was impressed by the way the characters' relationship \"inspires gay youth in a way that we haven't seen on network television yet\" and called them \"amazing role models for all teens\", and \"The Atlantic\" writer Kevin Fallon said it was \"remarkable\" and a \"milestone\" that \"the decision by gay teen characters to lose their virginities is given equal weight to that of a straight couple\".\n\nColfer has won several awards for his portrayal of Kurt. He was named Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 68th Golden Globe Awards. His performance in the groundbreaking role earned him a spot on the 2011 Time 100, \"Time\"'s 2011 list of the 100 most influential people in the world. He and the other series regulars won Favorite New Diverse Ensemble Cast at the 2009 Diversity Awards. In 2010, Colfer was awarded Favorite Breakout Actor, Favorite TV Actor and Gay/Bi Man of the Year by gay entertainment website \"AfterElton.com\", who also rated Kurt as the seventh best gay character of all time. \"AfterElton.com\" said, \"Colfer's portrayal of Kurt is that he's taken a character that's in many ways a gay stereotype ... and turned him into a well-rounded person who can both make us laugh and break our hearts.\" Colfer also won the 2010 Choice TV: Male Scene Stealer accolade at the Teen Choice Awards, and was part of the \"Glee\" cast ensemble given the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series award at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards. At the 2011 Dorian Awards, Colfer tied with co-star Jane Lynch for the TV Comedy Performance of the Year award. In addition to Colfer's own 2010 Golden Globe Award, the show won for Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy. \"Glee\" also received the 2010 and 2011 GLAAD Media Awards for Outstanding Series Comedy.\n\nThe role has earned Colfer nominations for further awards. He was nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards for his performance in the episode \"Laryngitis\", and at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards for his performance in \"Grilled Cheesus\". He received consecutive Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film nominations at the 2009 and 2010 Satellite Awards. At the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards, he was nominated for the Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series, and was included in the cast ensemble nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, and was again included in the cast ensemble nomination for the 18th Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\n"}

From 1872, when Ludwig was seven, his father suffered a long term illness and was often bed-ridden. One consequence of this was that he not only spent a lot of time with his father, but also met a variety of bankers, writers, scientists, doctors, artists and university professors who came to visit his father. These included the politician Ludwig Bamberger, the surgeon Theodor Billroth , the philosopher of history, Theodor Gomperz, the legal historian Adolf Exner and the historian Heinrich Friedjung. After his father's death, his mother prioritised his education with support from Bamberger. He subsequently attended Gymnasium Wasagasse and went on to study history, legal history and political economy at the Universities of Vienna and Berlin.

{"id": "33759585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33759585", "title": "Martin Shkreli", "text": "Martin Shkreli\n\nMartin Shkreli (; born March 17, 1983) is a former American businessman and hedge fund manager, and a convicted felon. He was the co-founder of the hedge funds Elea Capital, MSMB Capital Management, and MSMB Healthcare; co-founder and former chief executive officer (CEO) of the biotechnology firm Retrophin; and founder and former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Shkreli is the former CEO of start-up software company Gödel Systems, which he founded in August 2016.\n\nIn September 2015, Shkreli received widespread criticism when Turing obtained the manufacturing license for the antiparasitic drug Daraprim and raised its price by a factor of 56 (from to $750 per pill), leading him to be referred to by the media as \"the most hated man in America\" and \"'Pharma Bro'\".\n\nShkreli was charged in federal court, then convicted on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud. He was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and up to $7.4 million in fines.\n\nShkreli was born in Coney Island Hospital, Brooklyn, New York City, New York. His birth date is March 17, 1983. Shkreli threw an online party to celebrate his 33rd birthday on March 17, 2016. His parents are Albanian and Croatian who emigrated from Montenegro and worked as janitors. The Shkreli tribe is native to the Shkrel region in northern Albania. He, his two sisters, and his brother grew up in a working-class community in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Shkreli was raised Catholic and attended Sunday school as a child.\n\nShkreli attended Hunter College High School. He dropped out before his senior year but received the credits necessary for his diploma through a program that placed him in an internship at Wall Street hedge fund Cramer, Berkowitz and Company when he was 17. Sources differ on whether Shkreli graduated from Hunter or whether he received sufficient credits there but actually graduated from City-As-School High School. In March 2015, Hunter College High School announced that Shkreli had donated $1,000,000 which was the largest donation in the school's history.\n\nShkreli told \"Vanity Fair\" that he developed an interest in chemistry when a family member suffered from treatment-resistant depression.\n\nDuring Shkreli's time at Cramer, Berkowitz and Company, he recommended short-selling the stock of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company testing a weight-loss drug. When its price dropped in accordance with Shkreli's prediction, Cramer's hedge fund profited. Shkreli's prediction drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigated Shkreli's knowledge about the stock but was unable to prove wrongdoing on his part.\n\nAfter four years as an associate at Cramer Berkowitz, Shkreli worked as a financial analyst for Intrepid Capital Management and UBS Wealth Management. He then started his first hedge fund, Elea Capital Management, in 2006. In 2007, Lehman Brothers sued Elea in New York state court for failing to cover a 'put option transaction' in which Shkreli bet the wrong way on a broad market decline. When stocks rose, Shkreli didn't have the funds to make the bank whole. In October 2007, Lehman Brothers won a $2.3 million default judgment against Shkreli and Elea, but Lehman collapsed before it could collect on the ruling.\n\nIn September 2009, Shkreli started his own business. He launched MSMB Capital Management, which took its name from the initials of the two founding portfolio managers, Shkreli and his childhood friend, Marek Biestek. Shkreli and Biestek shorted biotech companies, then described flaws in the companies on stock trading chat rooms.\n\nOn February 1, 2011, in a naked short sale on an account it held with Merrill Lynch, MSMB Capital sold short 32 million shares of Orexigen Therapeutics stock at about $2.50 per share the day after its price plunged from $9.09, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve the drug Contrave. The stock price rebounded; MSMB could not cover the position, although it had told Merrill Lynch that it could. Merrill Lynch lost $7 million on the trade and MSMB Capital was virtually wiped out. Retrophin's 2015 SEC Complaint contended Shkreli had created MSMB Healthcare and Retrophin \"so that he could continue trading after MSMB Capital became insolvent and to create an asset that he might be able to use to placate his MSMB Capital investors.\"\n\nIn 2011, Shkreli filed requests with the FDA to reject a new cancer diagnostic device from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals and an inhalable insulin therapy from MannKind Corporation while publicly short-selling both companies' stocks, the values of which dropped after Shkreli's interventions. The companies had difficulty launching the products as a result, although the FDA ultimately approved both.\n\nIn 2011, MSMB made an unsolicited cash bid for AMAG Pharmaceuticals, . Matthew Herper of \"Forbes\" wrote that the attempted hostile takeover was \"done for the specific purpose of firing the company's management and stopping a proposed merger with Allos Therapeutics. When the merger plans stopped, so did Shkreli.\"\n\nShkreli founded Retrophin (a portmanteau of \"recombinant dystrophin\") in 2011 under the MSMB umbrella, and ran it as a portfolio company with an emphasis on biotechnology, to create treatments for rare diseases.\n\nRetrophin's board decided to replace Shkreli in September 2014, and he resigned from the company the following month. He was replaced by Stephen Aselage. During Shkreli's tenure as CEO, the company's employees used alias Twitter accounts to make gangster rap jokes and encourage short selling of other biotech stocks.\n\nAfter Shkreli's departure, Retrophin filed a lawsuit against him in August 2015, claiming that he had breached his duty of loyalty to the biopharmaceutical company in a long-running dispute over his use of company funds and \"committed stock-trading irregularities and other violations of securities rules\". The lawsuit alleged that Shkreli had threatened and harassed a former MSMB employee and his family.\n\nShkreli and some of his business associates have been under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York since January 2015. Shkreli invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying during civil depositions.\n\nShkreli's name is on two patents held by Retrophin for drugs to treat PKAN.\n\nCritics argued that Shkreli was intelligent but too immature and unfocused for the job of CEO. In July 2017, at Shkreli's criminal trial, Aselage testified: \"He's [Shkreli] a brilliant intellect, visionary.\"\n\nIn May 2014, Shkreli had difficultly accessing public markets for capital, but received a $4 million series A funding round and a PIPE deal valued at $10 million underwritten by Roth Capital Partners. After obtaining the financing, Shkreli was able to acquire rights to market tiopronin (brand name, Thiola), a drug used to treat the rare disease cystinuria and Chenodal and subsequently raise the price of each drug substantially, with Thiola subsequently being marked up about 20 fold, from $1.50 to $30 per pill (patients must take 10 to 15 pills a day), and Chenodal about five fold. Retrophin did not lower the price of these drugs after Shkreli's departure.\n\nIn 2016 Imprimis Pharmaceuticals introduced a lower cost version marketed as a compounded drug.\n\nShkreli founded Turing Pharmaceuticals in February 2015, after his departure from Retrophin. He launched Turing with three drugs in development acquired from Retrophin: an intranasal version of ketamine for depression, an intranasal version of oxytocin, and Vecamyl for hypertension. Shkreli set a business strategy for Turing: to obtain licenses on out-of-patent medicines and reevaluate the pricing of each in pursuit of windfall profits for the new company, without the need to develop and bring its own drugs to market. As markets for out-of-patent drugs are often small, and obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture a generic version is expensive, Turing calculated that with closed distribution for the product and no competition, it could set high prices.\n\nOn August 10, 2015, in accordance with Shkreli's business plan, Turing acquired Daraprim (pyrimethamine), a medication approved by the FDA in 1953, from Impax Laboratories for . The drug's most prominent use as of late 2015 was as an anti-malarial and an antiparasitic, in conjunction with leucovorin and sulfadiazine to treat patients with AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated toxoplasmosis.\n\nThe patent for Daraprim had expired, but no generic version was available. The Turing–Impax deal included the condition that Impax remove the drug from regular wholesalers and pharmacies, and so in June 2015, two months before the sale to Turing was announced, Impax switched to tightly controlled distribution. In keeping with its strategy for pricing in the face of limited competition (see above), Turing maintained the closed distribution. The \"New York Times\" noted that the deal \"made sense only if Turing planned to raise the price of the drug substantially.\"\n\nOn September 17, 2015, Dave Muoio of \"Healio\", an in-depth clinical information website for health care specialists, reported on a letter from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association to executives at Turing, questioning a new pricing for Daraprim. The price of a dose of the drug in the U.S. market increased from to per pill, overnight, a factor of 56.\n\nThe price increase was initially criticized, jointly, by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association, by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, and soon thereafter by presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump.\n\nA subsequent organized effort called on Turing to return pricing to pre-September levels and to address several matters relating to the needs of patients, an effort that garnered endorsements from more than 160 medical‑specialty and patient‑related organizations (, 164 organizations from thirty-one states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico).\n\nIn response to the controversy, the record label Collect Records publicly ended its business relationship with Shkreli, who had invested in the company.\n\nIn a September 2015 interview with \"Bloomberg Markets\", Shkreli claimed that despite the price increase, patient co-pays would actually be lower, that many patients would get the drug at no cost, that Turing had expanded its free drug program, and that it sold half of its drugs for one dollar. He defended the price hike by saying, \"If there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don't think that that should be a crime.\"\n\nA few days later, Shkreli announced that he planned to lower the price by an unspecified amount, \"in response to the anger that was felt by people\". But in late November, Turing reversed course and said it would not lower the price after all.\n\nFollowing a request by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings for details of Turing Pharmaceuticals' finances and price-setting practices in September 2015, the company hired four lobbyists from Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney with backgrounds in health care legislation and pharmaceutical pricing. In addition to lobbyists, Shkreli hired a crisis public relations firm to help explain the pricing decision.\n\nOn October 22, 2015, Mark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, announced that his company would provide a combination product containing pyrimethamine (the active ingredient in Daraprim) and leucovorin at \"$1-a-pill\" as a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Daraprim. This product is intended to be used alongside sulfadiazine in the standard protocol to treat toxoplasmosis typically seen in AIDS patients.\n\nBaum noted, \"This is not the first time a sole supply generic drugespecially one that has been approved for use as long as Daraprimhas had its price increased suddenly and to a level that may make it unaffordable\". He announced the availability of the compounded replacement for Daraprim as a part of a larger corporate program, \"Imprimis Cares\", to make \"novel and customizable medicines available to physicians and patients at accessible prices\". Imprimis is now offering its compounded, orally taken formulations of pyrimethamine and leucovorin beginning at for a 100‑count bottle, essentially a dollar a dose.\n\nOn November 23, 2015, Turing announced that the company would not reduce the list price of Daraprim, but said it planned instead to negotiate volume discounts of up to 50% for hospitals. Turing issued a statement that it was not as important to cut the list price as to reduce the cost to hospitals, where most patients get their initial treatment. The company pledged that no patient needing Daraprim would ever be denied access.\n\nInfectious disease specialists and patient advocates, including Tim Horn of the Treatment Action Group and Carlos del Rio of the HIV Medicine Association, said Turing's actions were insufficient, given that patients initially treated for days at a hospital typically have to continue the treatment for weeks or months after leaving.\n\nIn November 2015, an investor group led by Shkreli acquired a majority stake in KaloBios Pharmaceuticals (), a biopharmaceutical company based in South San Francisco, California. Shkreli was named CEO of the company and also planned to continue in the role of CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals. After his December 2015 arrest, KaloBios Pharmaceuticals terminated him as CEO. On December 29, 2015, KaloBios filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This followed NASDAQ delisting its shares, and the resignation of two directors.\n\nShkreli founded Gödel Systems in August 2016 as \"a professional software company that aims to be the leading information provider of data, workflow, and communications solutions for financial, law, and scientific professionals.\" By February 2017 Gödel Systems was looking to raise $1 million through a debt offering, and had raised $50,000 out of the $1 million in debt it began issuing in mid-January 2017, according to regulatory filings. Ralph Holzmann, a former senior engineer at Twitter, is the firm's chief technology officer.\n\nShkreli was subpoenaed to appear before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives to answer questions about the Daraprim price increase. Shkreli's efforts to quash the subpoena were unsuccessful.\n\nOn February 4, 2016, Shkreli appeared before the House committee, along with Nancy Retzlaff, the Chief Commercial Officer of Turing, and Howard B. Schiller, the interim CEO of Valeant.\n\nShkreli followed his lawyer's advice and refused to answer any questions, except to confirm his nameincluding those related to his acquisition of the most expensive music album ever madeby exercising his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nOn December 17, 2015, Shkreli was arrested by the FBI after a federal indictment in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York was filed, charging him with securities fraud. The charges were filed after an investigation into his tenure at MSMB Capital Management and Retrophin. He was accused of running a Ponzi-like scheme.\n\nFederal prosecutors said that Shkreli \"engaged in multiple schemes to ensnare investors through a web of lies and deceit\". In an interview with \"The Wall Street Journal\", Shkreli said that he was targeted by law enforcement for his price hikes of the drug Daraprim and his flamboyant personality.\n\nIn early 2016, Shkreli retained criminal defense attorney Benjamin Brafman to defend him. At his 2017 trial, Shkreli argued that none of his investors actually lost money (some actually turned a profit) and thus his actions did not constitute a crime. Shkreli's frequent criticisms of the federal prosecutors in New York's Eastern District, whom he called \"junior varsity\" compared to their counterparts in the Southern District across the East River, both on his Facebook streaming video feed and in the hallways of the courthouse, led those prosecutors to request that judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto issue a gag order to prevent what they called a \"campaign of disruption.\" Brafman claimed in response that his client was responding to baiting from the media and was also suffering from extreme anxiety because of his situation. Matsumoto ordered Shkreli not to speak with reporters, either in the courthouse or its immediate vicinity.\n\nOn August 4, 2017, the trial jury found Shkreli guilty on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and not guilty on five other counts. Shkreli said he was delighted with the outcome and described his prosecution as \"a witch hunt of epic proportions.\"\n\nOn September 13, 2017, his bail was revoked following a Facebook post offering $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair which the judge perceived as solicitation to assault, which is not protected under the First Amendment. Shkreli's post was preceded by others that suggested he might have plans to clone Hillary Clinton. Shkreli said that his post was satire, and his lawyer described it as tasteless but not a threat. Shkreli edited the post to add a disclaimer that it was satire, and later said he did this minutes after publication. Shkreli apologized for the post. He was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn while awaiting sentencing.\n\nShkreli is appealing his conviction.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, Shkreli was ordered to forfeit nearly $7.4 million in assets. The court ordered that if Shkreli had insufficient cash to fulfill the forfeiture order, his assets—including a piece of art by Pablo Picasso, his unique Wu-Tang album \"Once Upon a Time in Shaolin\", the unreleased Lil Wayne album\" Tha Carter V\", and Shkreli's pharmaceutical company shares—could be seized. In April he was ordered to pay $388,000 in restitution.\n\nDuring his sentencing, judge Kiyo Matsumoto said Shkreli seemed \"genuinely remorseful,\" regarding his \"egregious multitude of lies,\" but said he had \"repeatedly minimized\" his misconduct. Shkreli, who reportedly cried as he gave his statement to the court, stated \"I was never motivated by money.\"\n\nOn March 9, 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to seven years in federal prison. He is federal inmate number 87850-053 and was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn prior to being transferred to federal prison. On March 27, 2018 it was reported that Judge Kiyo Matsumoto agreed to recommend Shkreli serve his prison sentence at the minimum security federal camp at USP Canaan, which he had previously requested. On April 18, 2018, Shkreli was transferred from Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn to FCI Fort Dix after his request to serve at USP Canaan was denied.\n\nAs of October 25, 2018, with the assistance of a friend, Shkreli is keeping an online blog while incarcerated wherein he posts regularly on his thoughts on investing, the pharmaceutical industry, as well as personal notes on his incarceration.\n\nIn December 2016, the New York state Department of Taxation and Finance issued a tax warrant for $1.26 million for unpaid taxes owed by Shkreli. After Shkreli made partial payments, the state recouped another $134,500 from Shkreli by seizing and auctioning off an Enigma machine for $65,000, a manuscript signed by Isaac Newton, a letter from Charles Darwin, and another letter written by English mathematician and writer Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace.\n\nOn April 23, 2018, it was reported that in court filings New York's attorney general had asked Judge Matsumoto for priority on more than $480,000 in court-ordered forfeitures, to recover additional unpaid taxes and penalties owed to the state, over the federal government's claims for Shkreli's forfeited assets. Prior to Shkreli's conviction, the state of New York had been aggressively attempting to collect the tax debts from Shkreli and had already seized and auctioned off several of items including the rare Nazi Enigma code machine.\n\nAt the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Shkreli had agreed to an order that would bar him from the securities industry in order to settle a pending SEC administrative action against him, however, Shkreli is eligible to apply for readmission to the industry subject to applicable laws and regulations governing the process.\n\nIn January 2016, \"Fortune\" estimated the 32-year-old Shkreli's net worth as at least $45 million but later updated its profile to reflect that this article was published the value of Shkreli's E*Trade account has dropped by more than $40 million\". Shkreli leveraged a $4 million E-Trade account for his bail.\n\nIn June 2017, Reuters reported that Shkreli had reported his net worth at $70 million after being arrested in 2015 and that his attorney Benjamin Brafman, in a hearing before Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, had conceded that his client still owned shares of Turing Pharmaceuticals worth between $30 to $50 million.\n\nIn October 2015, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders acknowledged having received a $2,700 donation from Shkreli, whom he had previously called a \"poster child of greed\". Sanders, however, said he would forward the money to Whitman-Walker Health, a D.C. community clinic known for its expertise in HIV/AIDS healthcare. Shkreli told medicine news portal STAT that among his reasons for donating to Sanders' campaign was that he supports some of Sanders' positions, excluding the ones about drug prices. He claimed he hoped to gain Sanders' attention in order to explain to him in a private meeting the drug companies' price-setting mechanisms.\n\nShkreli has a variety of interests ranging from collecting rare music albums to video gaming. He is an avid \"League of Legends\" player and in May 2014 he began expressing interest in purchasing an eSports team, Enemy eSports announced that it had rejected a offer from Shkreli. He later founded his own team, Odyssey eSports, and aimed to qualify for the 2015 North American League of Legends Challenger Series. The team failed to qualify. In August 2015, Odyssey merged with another team to become the organisation Team Imagine, with Shkreli becoming chairman of the team. During the merger, the organization signed the \"Dota 2\" team Leviathan.\n\nIn November 2015, Shkreli began livestreaming on YouTube. His streams, which last for hours at a time, have shown him working and idly passing time in mundane ways, such as playing video games, using social media or taking telephone calls. Later he conducted lessons in market analysis and chemistry, explaining the basics of each subject. He had previously streamed on the website Twitch but switched to YouTube. When Shkreli was arraigned in December and released on bail, he continued streaming from his apartment.\n\nShkreli was revealed as the winner of an auction for the Wu-Tang Clan album \"Once Upon a Time in Shaolin\" after the single copy of the album was sold via Paddle8 on November 24, 2015, for to what was reported to be a \"private American collector\". On December 9, 2015, \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" identified Shkreli as the purchaser. In October 2016, Shkreli claimed on his Twitter that he would release the album for free download if Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election and would destroy the album if Hillary Clinton won. He shared the intro and one track the day after Trump became the President-elect. In early September 2017, he put the album for sale on eBay, selling for $1,025,100.\n\nIn February 2016, he announced in an offer letter $10 million to become the sole owner of Kanye West's album \"The Life of Pablo\". On February 12, 2016, Shkreli increased his offer for West's \"The Life of Pablo\" from $10 million to $15 million.\n\nShkreli was formerly a benefactor of Collect Records, a record label run by musician Geoff Rickly, and offered to bail out rapper Bobby Shmurda; Shkreli retracted this offer after his own arrest.\n\nIn February 2017, Shkreli was invited to speak at Harvard University. The requested travel was approved by a judge.\n\n"}
{"id": "2267752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2267752", "title": "Mary, Lady Heath", "text": "Mary, Lady Heath\n\nMary, Lady Heath (10 November 1896 – 9 May 1939) was an Irish aviator and began life as Sophie Catherine Theresa Mary Peirce-Evans in Knockaderry, County Limerick, near the town of Newcastle West. She was one of the best known women in the world for a five-year period from the mid-1920s.\n\nWhen the young Sophie Peirce-Evans was one year old, her father John Peirce-Evans, bludgeoned her mother Kate Theresa Dooling to death with a heavy stick. He was found guilty of murder and declared insane. His daughter was taken to the home of her grandfather in Newcastle West where she was brought up by two maiden aunts, who discouraged her passion for sports.\n\nAfter schooldays in Rochelle School, Cork; Princess Garden Belfast and St Margaret's Hall on Mespil Road in Dublin, where she played hockey and tennis, Sophie enrolled in the Royal College of Science in Ireland (which later became subsumed into UCD and is currently home to the Taoiseach's office on Merrion Street).\n\nThe college was designed to produce the educated farmers which the country then needed. Sophie, one of the few women in the college, duly took a top-class degree in science, specialising in agriculture. She also played with the college hockey team and contributed to a student magazine, copies of which are held in the National Library of Ireland.\n\nBefore becoming a pilot Lady Heath had already made her mark. During the First World War, she spent two years as a dispatch rider, based in England and later France, where she had her portrait painted by Sir John Lavery. By then, she had married the first of her three husbands and as Sophie Mary Eliott-Lynn, was one of the founders of the Women's Amateur Athletic Association after her move from her native Ireland to London in 1922, following a brief sojourn in Aberdeen. She was Britain's first women's javelin champion and set a disputed world record for the high jump. She was also a delegate to the International Olympic Committee in 1925, the same year that she took her first flying lessons. In 1923 she represented the United Kingdom at the 1923 Women's Olympiad in Monte Carlo, during the games she came third place at the high jump, javelin throw and the Women's pentathlon, later that year she participated in the first WAAA Championships. In 1924 she participated in the 1924 Women's Olympiad winning the silver medal in the long jump, in 1926 she again represented the United Kingdom at javelin at the 1926 Women's World Games in Gothenburg, coming fourth with a throw of 44.63 metres.\n\nThe following year, Lady Heath became the first woman to hold a commercial flying licence in Britain and along the way, set records for altitude in a small plane and later a Shorts seaplane, was the first woman to parachute from an aeroplane (landing in the middle of a football match). After her great flight from the Cape, she took a mechanic's qualification in the USA, the first woman to do so.\n\nIn an era when the world had gone aviation-mad due to the exploits of Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart, Lady Heath was more than able to hold her own. \"Britain's Lady Lindy,\" as she was known in the United States, made front-page news as the first pilot, male or female, to fly a small open-cockpit aircraft from Cape Town to London (Croydon Aerodrome). She had thought it would take her three weeks; as it turned out, it took her three months, from January to May 1928.\n\nA scale model of the plane used by Lady Mary is on display at The Little Museum of Dublin. She wrote about the experience later in a book \"Woman and Flying\", that she co-wrote with Stella Wolfe Murray. In July 1928 she spent a few weeks volunteering as a co-pilot with a civil airline, KLM. She was hoping to be appointed to the newly created Batavia route, which would have made her the first woman pilot with a commercial airline. The world was not ready for female pilots and her hope was not fulfilled.\n\nJust when her fame was at its height, with her life a constant whirl of lectures, races and long-distance flights, Lady Heath (she married Sir James Heath in October 1927) was badly injured in a crash just before the National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio in 1929. Before her accident Lady Heath applied for American citizenship, intending to remain in the USA where she had made a good living on the lecture circuit and as an agent for promote Cirrus engines. Lady Heath was never the same after her accident.\n\nAfter divorce in Reno, Nevada, from Heath in 1930, she returned to Ireland with her third husband G.A.R. Williams, a horseman and pilot of Caribbean origin, and became involved in private aviation, briefly running her own company at Kildonan, near Dublin in the mid-1930s, and helping produce the generation of pilots that would help establish the national airline Aer Lingus.\n\nLady Heath first marriage was to Major William Elliot Lynn after which she was well known as Mrs Elliot Lynn. She divorced her husband, alleging cruelty and after he died in London in early 1927, married Sir James Heath on 11 October 1927 at Christ Church in Mayfair, London. In January 1930 she filed for a divorce from Heath in Reno, Nevada, United States and was awarded a decree nisi in May of the same year.\n\nOn 12 November 1931, she married G.A.R Williams in Lexington, Kentucky, United States.\n\nOn 9 May 1939, aged 42, she died in St Leonard's Hospital, Shoreditch, London following a fall inside a double-decker tram. At the inquest the conductor gave evidence that she was sitting on the top deck and she seemed \"very vague\"; another passenger commented to the conductor that \"I think the lady is asleep\", before she fell down the stairs and hit her head on the driver's controller box. In the previous years, with alcoholism now a serious problem, she had left Ireland and her husband for England and had made a number of appearances in court on charges relating to drunkenness.\n\nA pathologist said he found no evidence of alcohol but detailed evidence of an old blood clot which may have caused the fall; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. On 15 May 1939, according to newspaper reports, her ashes were scattered over Surrey from an aircraft flown by her estranged husband from Croydon Airport although legend has it that her ashes were returned to Ireland where they were scattered over her native Newcastle West. \n\nIn 2013, aviator Tracey Curtis-Taylor retraced Lady Heath's 1928 South Africa to England flight in a biplane.

{"id": "25254918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25254918", "title": "Maurice Clemmons", "text": "Maurice Clemmons\n\nMaurice Clemmons (February 6, 1972 – December 1, 2009) was the shooter in the November 29, 2009 murder of four police officers in Parkland, Washington. After evading police for two days following the shooting, Clemmons was shot and killed by a police officer in Seattle.\n\nPrior to his involvement in the shooting, Clemmons had at least five felony convictions in Arkansas and at least eight felony charges in Washington. His first incarceration began in 1989, at age 17. Facing sentences totaling 108 years in prison, the burglary sentences were reduced in 2000 by Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee to 47 years, which made him immediately eligible for parole. The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously moved to release him in 2000. Clemmons was subsequently arrested on other charges and was jailed several times. In the months prior to the Parkland shooting, he was in jail on charges of assaulting a police officer and raping a child. One week prior to the Parkland shooting, he was released from jail after posting a $150,000 bail bond. \n\nAt the time, Clemmons' murder of four police officers represented the largest number of law enforcement officers killed by a lone perpetrator in a single incident in U.S. history. It was surpassed in July 2016 when a mass shooting occurred in Dallas, Texas, resulting in the deaths of five police officers.\n\nMaurice Clemmons's father made frames for automobile seats at a Chrysler factory, and his mother, Dorothy Mae Clemmons, worked in a nursing home. He had five siblings. Clemmons lived in Marianna, Arkansas in his early youth, and moved to Little Rock as a teen. He was arrested when he was a junior at Hall High School for carrying a .25-caliber pistol on school property. He claimed to be carrying the gun because he was \"beaten by dopers\", and said he had \"something for them\" if they attacked him again. Clemmons did not return to school, and finished his education at eleventh grade. In 1989, a 17-year-old Clemmons and two other accomplices robbed a woman at midnight in the parking lot of a Little Rock hotel bar. Clemmons pretended to have a gun in his pocket and threatened to shoot her if she did not give him her purse. When she responded, \"Well, why don't you just shoot?\", he punched her in the head and ran off with the purse, which contained $16 and a credit card.\n\nClemmons was accused multiple times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal door stop and hid it in his sock to use as a weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.\n\nBy 1990, Clemmons was sentenced to 108 years in prison for eight felony charges from his teenage years in Arkansas. The total prison term stemmed from multiple sentences, some of which were concurrent to others and some were consecutive. The largest sentencing came in 1990, when he was given a 60-year prison term for breaking into an Arkansas state trooper's home and stealing about $6,700-worth of items, including a gun. \n\nDuring his sentencing on the charges, a circuit judge told Clemmons that he had broken his mother's heart, to which he responded, \"I have broken my own heart.\" Clemmons was sentenced in 1989 to 35 years in prison for robbing the woman in front of the Little Rock hotel bar. Among his other sentences were six years for weapon possession based on his high school arrest; and eight years for burglary, theft and probation in Pulaski County on September 9, 1989. He was ineligible for parole until 2015 or later. He was originally held at the Tucker Correctional Facility in Tucker, Arkansas, but was eventually transferred to the Cummins Unit near Grady.\n\nIn 1999, after having served 10 years of his sentence, Clemmons filed a clemency appeal with Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. \n\nIn his petition to Huckabee, Clemmons wrote he came from \"a very good Christian family\" and was \"raised much better than my actions speak\". Clemmons claimed he had just moved from Seattle, Washington, to Arkansas as a teenager, and because he had no friends he gave in to peer pressure and \"fell in with the wrong crowd\" to be accepted by his young peers, which led him to commit his crimes. Although he apologized for his actions, Clemmons also complained that he received overly harsh sentences. He also claimed to have changed and expressed regret that his mother had recently died without seeing him turn his life around. Clemmons' clemency application was supported by Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Marion Humphrey, who argued the cumulative sentence was excessive and cited Clemmons' young age at the time he committed the crimes.\n\nThe decision was made over the objections of some victims and prosecutors involved in Clemmons' previous cases but was supported by the bipartisan parole board and the trial court judge in Clemmons' case. Mark Fraiser, an attorney who prosecuted early cases against Clemmons in Pulaski County, argued Clemmons was extremely likely to commit further acts of violence in the future, and said for a teen to receive such a lengthy prison sentence without committing a murder, \"you've got to be a bad little dude\". On May 3, 2000, Huckabee commuted Clemmons' 108-year sentence to 47 years, 5 months and 19 days, which made him eligible for parole that day. As a factor in his decision, Huckabee cited the unusually long sentence for Clemmons' age at the time the crimes were committed. The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously approved Clemmons' release on July 13, 2000, and he was set free on August 1, 2000.\n\nIn March 2001, Clemmons violated parole by committing aggravated robbery and theft again in Ouachita County. He was convicted on July 13, 2001 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He faced charges of parole violations, but due to problems with the case, he was not served with the charges until 2004. His attorney argued the parole violation charges should be dropped because so much time had passed, and they were subsequently dismissed. Clemmons was granted parole on the robbery charges in 2004. He told the parole board he was \"not ready\" the first time he was released, but that he \"doesn't want to die in prison\" and will \"try to do the right thing\". Clemmons moved to Washington in 2004 while still on parole, which was approved by Arkansas authorities. That year, he married a woman named Nicole Smith, although \"The Seattle Times\" later reported the relationship had \"been tumultuous\". He was placed under the supervision of the Washington State Department of Corrections and classified as \"high risk to reoffend\". His supervision was to continue until October 2015. He lived in Tacoma, where he ran a landscaping and power-washing business out of his house. Over the next five years, Clemmons bought six houses, including one in Arkansas and five in Washington.\n\nFollowing his parole in 2004, Clemmons had no arrests or problems with the law until May 2009. \"The Seattle Times\" referred to four days in May 2009 as the time when \"Maurice Clemmons' behavior and mental state deteriorated\". On May 9, a Pierce County sheriff's deputy responded to Clemmons' home after reports he was throwing rocks at houses, cars and people. When the deputy tried to enter the house, one of Clemmons' cousins grabbed his wrist. After a struggle, Clemmons emerged from the house and punched the deputy in the face, and assaulted a second deputy who arrived to help. Clemmons was placed under arrest and taken to Pierce County Jail, where he continued to struggle and told jail workers, \"I'll kill all you bitches.\" He was charged with two felony assault charges and two felony malicious mischief charges, and released from jail the next day after posting a $40,000 bail bond without seeing a judge.\n\nOn May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons appeared naked in his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old into his bedroom along with Clemmons' wife. Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family back into the living room and demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world was coming to an end and that he was \"going to fly to heaven\". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. Child Protective Services investigated and substantiated the sexual abuse complaint. Latanya Clemmons, Clemmons's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was \"not in his right mind\".\n\nClemmons was arrested on July 1, 2009, after he appeared in a Pierce County court trying to have his bench warrant thrown out. He was charged with second-degree rape of a child, as well as being a fugitive from Arkansas. At the time of his arrest, Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as \"the beast\". He also told a police officer that President Barack Obama and LeBron James were his brothers, and Oprah Winfrey was his sister. Pierce County prosecutors asserted that Clemmons' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons' parole in Arkansas, and that he faced years in prison if he was returned to the state. However, the Arkansas Department of Community Correction notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his extradition and that he should be adjudicated on his Washington charges. Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County, said of the Arkansas decision, \"There's a built-in incentive to not following through. In a way, the more violent they are, the less you want them in your community.\"\n\nDuring a court-ordered mental health evaluation, Clemmons told psychologists he had experienced hallucinations in May 2009 of \"people drinking blood and people eating babies, and lawless on the streets, like people were cannibals\". He claimed the visions had since passed. He also claimed to have no faith in the American justice system and thought he was being \"maliciously persecuted because I'm black and they believe the police\". The evaluation, completed by two psychologists from the Western State Hospital on October 19, concluded Clemmons was dangerous and presented an increased risk of future criminal acts. Pierce County Judge John McCarthy set bail for Clemmons' assault charges at $40,000, considerably below the $100,000 prosecutors sought based on Clemmons' history of violence. Pierce County Judge Thomas Felnagle set bail for the child-rape charges at $150,000, lower than the $200,000 sought by prosecutors, but higher than usual for the charges. \n\nAfter a mental evaluation, a psychologist concluded Clemmons was competent to stand trial on the charges, which eliminated him as a candidate for involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an insanity or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release. Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court.\n\nClemmons failed to check in with his community corrections officer within 24 hours of his release as required, but nothing was done in response. On November 26, 2009, less than one week after Clemmons posted his bail bond, during a Thanksgiving gathering at the home of Clemmons' aunt, Clemmons told several people he was angry about his Pierce County legal problems and that he planned to use a gun to murder police officers and others, including school children. He showed a gun to the people in the room and told them he had two others in his car and home. Clemmons said he planned to activate an alarm by removing a court-ordered ankle monitor, then he would shoot the police officers who responded to his house. In describing the planned murder, Clemmons said, \"Knock, knock, knock, boom!\" \n\nDarcus Allen, a convicted murderer who previously served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly present for the conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice tried to go to a Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.\n\nOn the morning of November 29, Clemmons drove a white pickup truck to Allen's home, and then Allen drove him past the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop in Parkland, Washington, a suburb of Tacoma. After they saw marked police patrol cars in the parking lot, Allen drove back past the coffee shop and parked nearby. Some reports from witnesses said Clemmons parked his truck in a car wash north of the coffee shop and pretended to clean the vehicle, but never turned the hose on. Around 8 a.m, Clemmons walked into the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop, where four police officers were working on laptops before their shift. Clemmons opened fire on the officers, shooting them to death. \n\nInvestigators said the murders were a targeted, execution-style attack and not associated with a robbery; Clemmons did not aim at any other customers or the two baristas working at the time. The four slain officers were Mark Renninger, 39 (killed with a shot to the head); Ronald Owens, 37 (shot in the neck); Tina Griswold, 40 (shot in the head); and Greg Richards, 42 (shot in the head).\n\nAs Clemmons fled, Officer Richards struggled with him in the restaurant's doorway, then shot Clemmons in the back before the officer succumbed to a bullet wound to his head. The shooter stole Richards' Glock pistols before escaping. Clemmons returned to the truck and Allen drove him away. Allen later told detectives he stopped at an intersection and abandoned Clemmons and the truck, claiming he \"wants no part of this\". Authorities however, later disputed this claim and said there was no evidence Allen abandoned the vehicle. Clemmons was identified later that day as a \"person of interest\" in the murders, but soon after was identified as a wanted suspect. Police identified no motive for the murders, and Detective Ed Troyer, Pierce County Sheriff’s Office spokesman, said, \"We're going to be surprised if there is a motive worth mentioning.\" Police initially believed the suspect might have died from his injuries shortly after the shooting.\n\nClemmons went back to his house and told Hinton he had been shot by police, and Hinton allegedly gave Eddie and Douglas Davis a car to \"get Clemmons out of here\". As they drove, Clemmons told the brothers he \"had taken care of his business\". The Davis brothers took Clemmons to other friends, who bandaged his wounds. Later that day, police received a tip that Clemmons was seeking shelter from friends in Seattle. Police pulled over a white car they believed to have been transporting him, and the female driver admitted Clemmons was a friend and she had brought him to Seattle after he told her \"he had killed a police officer or officers\".\n\nCoffee shop employees who witnessed the shooting identified Clemmons as the shooter from a series of photos. Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle-Tacoma area had ever seen, and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest. Authorities also surrounded the homes of Clemmons' friends and family in order to prevent him from finding shelter, and to determine who was helping him. A relative learned that Clemmons was coming to her home in the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle, informed the police and fled. Police locked down the house for 11 hours in the early morning of November 30, believing Clemmons to be holed up inside. After several attempts to coax or force him out of the house, including use of a robot and flashbang grenades, police entered and discovered Clemmons was not inside. Later that day, police searched multiple locations in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, including a park where they found a handgun carried by Clemmons and his pickup truck, which had blood stains inside.\n\nOn December 1, 2009, Clemmons was shot and killed by Seattle police officer Benjamin L. Kelly. \nAround 2:45 a.m., Kelly was on patrol and stopped to investigate a broken-down car on the side of the road, which was idling with its hood up. Kelly recognized the vehicle as having been reported stolen. While sitting in his patrol car and writing a report, Kelly noticed Clemmons approaching him and recognized him as the suspect in the Lakewood shooting. Kelly ordered him to stop and show his hands, but he instead began to flee around the disabled vehicle. Police claim that Clemmons reached into his waist area for a gun. Kelly fired several rounds at Clemmons and hit him at least twice, killing him. Clemmons was carrying a handgun that had belonged to Lakewood Officer Greg Richards. Kelly was placed on routine administrative leave following the shooting. Police later said Clemmons would have eventually died from the gunshot wound he sustained at the Lakewood shooting.\n\nSince his death, multiple people have been arrested for helping Clemmons during and after the Lakewood shooting. Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts, gave him cell phones and money, applied first aid to his gunshot wounds and tried to help him leave the state. Among those arrested were Clemmons' sister, who bandaged his wounds and provided him transportation. Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons: Letricia Nelson, Quiana Williams, Douglas Davis, Eddie Davis, and Ricky Hinton. Darcus Allen was arrested and charged with aggravated first-degree murder for his alleged role as Clemmons' getaway driver. Allen claims he did not know Clemmons' plans when he drove him to the coffee shop, but authorities argued he had known for days that Clemmons planned to murder police officers.\n\nFuneral arrangements were kept private by the family due to the circumstances of his crime.\n\n"}

He was Professor of Psychological Medicine at the University of Edinburgh from 1961 to 1973, President of the World Mental Health Organization from 1968 to 1972, and Vice-Chancellor of the University of York from 1973 to 1978. In his youth, he had been a distinguished long-distance runner.\n\nCarstairs was born on 18 June 1916 in Mussoorie, India, then part of the British Raj. He was the son of the Reverend Dr George Carstairs, a Church of Scotland missionary, and Elizabeth Huntley Carstairs (née Young). He spent his childhood living in India and became fluent in both English and Hindi. At the age of ten, he and his family moved to Edinburgh, Scotland. He was educated at George Watson's College, then an all-boys independent school in Edinburgh. He went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. In 1941, he graduated Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MB ChB).\n\nHe was an accomplished long-distance runner in his youth. He was the Scottish 3 miles champion in 1937, 1938 and 1939. He represented Scotland at the 1937 International University Games, winning a silver medal in the 5000 metres in a time of 15:24.2. He also represented Scotland at the 1939 International University Games, winning a gold medal in the 5000 metres in a time of 15:20.2. He represented Great Britain at the 1938 European Athletics Championships, coming sixth in the Men's 5000 metres with a time of 14:51.3.\n\nHaving completed medical training, Carstairs was called up for active service during World War II as a medical officer with the Royal Air Force. He was commissioned into the Medical Branch of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 15 May 1942 as a flying officer (emergency). He was promoted to flight lieutenant (war substantive) on 15 May 1943. He was demobilised in 1946.\n\nFollowing graduation in 1941, Carstairs worked in general medicine. He was an assistant physician at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital for a year. He served as a medical officer with the Royal Air Force between 1942 and 1946.\n\nIn 1953, he began his career in psychiatry when he was appointed a senior registrar at the Maudsley Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in London, England. There he worked with chronic psychiatric patients under the supervision of Sir Aubrey Lewis. During his work, he come to the conclusion that patients with schizophrenia needed a neutral environment to cope with their condition and returning them to an 'emotionally charged family setting' would only set back their recovery. He also discovered that improved motivation in patients helped their rehabilitation.\n\nIn 1960, he was appointed head of a new Medical Research Council unit based at University College London. This unit led the study of psychiatric epidemiology in the United Kingdom. When he moved to Edinburgh in 1961, he moved the unit with him and continued its research. He stood down as director in 1971, and was followed by Norman Kreitman.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1972, he was President of the World Mental Health Organization. While holding that post, he was involved in the development of psychiatric facilities in under-developed countries. In 1978, he left academia and devoted his time to advising the World Health Organization on developing psychiatric services in India, with emphasis on making them appropriate to Asian needs.\n\nIn 1961, Carstairs was appointed Professor of Psychological Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. At the university he created a new working group of academics and practising psychiatrists for research and teaching; it was the first such group created outside London. At the university he taught a wide range of course at both undergraduate and graduate level.\n\nHe gave the 1962 Reith Lectures, a renowned public lecture series broadcast on BBC Radio, titled \"This Island Now\". In one lecture he condoned pre-marital sex, which produced controversy. His statement of belief was offensive to many British Christians, particularly given that he was the son of a clergyman.\n\nIn January 1973, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the University of York. He was only the second person to head the university as it had only been established in 1963. The 1970s were a difficult time to be involved in university leadership in the United Kingdom. The country was in recession and student protests were frequent. He had plans to expand the university both physically and in the number of subjects it taught, but because of the hostile atmosphere he faced these were not achieved during his vice-chancellorship. This experience meant that he never returned to full-time academia after leaving the post in the summer of 1978.\n\nCarstairs suffered from senile dementia in his later years. He withdrew from professional life, and was cared for by his first wife. He died at his Edinburgh home on 17 April 1991.\n"}
{"id": "21444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21444", "title": "Niccolò Machiavelli", "text": "Niccolò Machiavelli\n\nNiccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (, ; 3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527) was an Italian diplomat, politician, historian, philosopher, humanist, writer, playwright and poet of the Renaissance period. He has often been called the father of modern political science. For many years he was a senior official in the Florentine Republic, with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He also wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is renowned by Italian scholars. He was secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power. He wrote his most well-known work \"The Prince\" (\"Il Principe\") in 1513, having been exiled from city affairs.\n\n\"Machiavellianism\" is widely used as a negative term to characterize unscrupulous politicians of the sort Machiavelli described most famously in \"The Prince.\" Machiavelli described immoral behavior, such as dishonesty and the killing of innocents, as being normal and effective in politics. He even seemed to encourage it in some situations. The book gained notoriety due to claims that it teaches \"evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power\".\n\nThe term \"Machiavellian\" is often associated with political deceit, deviousness, and realpolitik. On the other hand, many commentators, such as Baruch Spinoza, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Denis Diderot, have argued that Machiavelli was actually a republican, even when writing \"The Prince\", and his writings were an inspiration to Enlightenment proponents of modern democratic political philosophy. In one place, for example, he noted his admiration for the selfless Roman dictator Cincinnatus.\n\nMachiavelli was born in Florence, Italy, the third child and first son of attorney Bernardo di Niccolò Machiavelli and his wife, Bartolomea di Stefano Nelli. The Machiavelli family is believed to be descended from the old marquesses of Tuscany and to have produced thirteen Florentine Gonfalonieres of Justice, one of the offices of a group of nine citizens selected by drawing lots every two months and who formed the government, or Signoria; but he was never a full citizen of Florence because of the nature of Florentine citizenship in that time even under the republican regime. Machiavelli married Marietta Corsini in 1502.\n\nMachiavelli was born in a tumultuous era in which popes waged acquisitive wars against Italian city-states, and people and cities often fell from power as France, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire battled for regional influence and control. Political-military alliances continually changed, featuring condottieri (mercenary leaders), who changed sides without warning, and the rise and fall of many short-lived governments.\n\nMachiavelli was taught grammar, rhetoric, and Latin. It is thought that he did not learn Greek even though Florence was at the time one of the centers of Greek scholarship in Europe. In 1494 Florence restored the republic, expelling the Medici family that had ruled Florence for some sixty years. Shortly after the execution of Savonarola, Machiavelli was appointed to an office of the second chancery, a medieval writing office that put Machiavelli in charge of the production of official Florentine government documents. Shortly thereafter, he was also made the secretary of the \"Dieci di Libertà e Pace.\"\n\nIn the first decade of the sixteenth century, he carried out several diplomatic missions: most notably to the Papacy in Rome. Moreover, from 1502 to 1503, he witnessed the brutal reality of the state-building methods of Cesare Borgia (1475–1507) and his father, Pope Alexander VI, who were then engaged in the process of trying to bring a large part of Central Italy under their possession. The pretext of defending Church interests was used as a partial justification by the Borgias. Other excursions to the court of Louis XII and the Spanish court influenced his writings such as \"The Prince\".\n\nBetween 1503 and 1506, Machiavelli was responsible for the Florentine militia. He distrusted mercenaries (a distrust that he explained in his official reports and then later in his theoretical works for their unpatriotic and uninvested nature in the war that makes their allegiance fickle and often too unreliable when most needed) and instead staffed his army with citizens, a policy that was to be repeatedly successful. Under his command, Florentine citizen-soldiers defeated Pisa in 1509.\n\nHowever, Machiavelli's success did not last. In August 1512 the Medici, backed by Pope Julius II, used Spanish troops to defeat the Florentines at Prato, but many historians have argued that it was due to Piero Soderini's unwillingness to compromise with the Medici, who were holding Prato under siege. In the wake of the siege, Soderini resigned as Florentine head of state and left in exile. The experience would, like Machiavelli's time in foreign courts and with the Borgia, heavily influence his political writings.\n\nAfter the Medici victory, the Florentine city-state and the republic were dissolved, and Machiavelli was deprived of office in 1512. In 1513 the Medici accused him of conspiracy against them and had him imprisoned. Despite having been subjected to torture (\"with the rope\" in which the prisoner is hanged from his bound wrists, from the back, forcing the arms to bear the body's weight and dislocating the shoulders), he denied involvement and was released after three weeks.\n\nMachiavelli then retired to his estate at Sant'Andrea in Percussina, near San Casciano in Val di Pesa, and devoted himself to studying and writing of the political treatises that earned his place in the intellectual development of political philosophy and political conduct.\n\nDespairing of the opportunity to remain directly involved in political matters, after a time, he began to participate in intellectual groups in Florence and wrote several plays that (unlike his works on political theory) were both popular and widely known in his lifetime. Still, politics remained his main passion and, to satisfy this interest, he maintained a well-known correspondence with more politically connected friends, attempting to become involved once again in political life.\n\nIn a letter to Francesco Vettori, he described his exile:\n\nWhen evening comes, I go back home, and go to my study. On the threshold, I take off my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an ambassador would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed to talk to them and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.\n\nMachiavelli died in 1527 at 58 after receiving his last rites. He was buried at the Church of Santa Croce in Florence. An epitaph honouring him is inscribed on his monument. The Latin legend reads: (\"So great a name (has) no adequate praise\" or \"No eulogy (would be) a match for such a great name\").\n\nCommentators have taken very different approaches to Machiavelli and not always agreed. Major discussion has tended to be about two issues: first, how unified and philosophical his work is, and second, concerning how innovative or traditional it is.\n\nThere is some disagreement concerning how best to describe the unifying themes, if there are any, that can be found in Machiavelli's works, especially in the two major political works, \"The Prince\" and \"Discourses\". Some commentators have described him as inconsistent, and perhaps as not even putting a high priority in consistency. Others such as Hans Baron have argued that his ideas must have changed dramatically over time. Some have argued that his conclusions are best understood as a product of his times, experiences and education. Others, such as Leo Strauss and Harvey Mansfield, have argued strongly that there is a very strong and deliberate consistency and distinctness, even arguing that this extends to all of Machiavelli's works including his comedies and letters.\n\nCommentators such as Leo Strauss have gone so far as to name Machiavelli as the deliberate originator of modernity itself. Others have argued that Machiavelli is only a particularly interesting example of trends which were happening around him. In any case Machiavelli presented himself at various times as someone reminding Italians of the old virtues of the Romans and Greeks, and other times as someone promoting a completely new approach to politics.\n\nThat Machiavelli had a wide range of influences is in itself not controversial. Their relative importance is however a subject of on-going discussion. It is possible to summarize some of the main influences emphasized by different commentators.\n\n1. The Mirror of Princes genre. summarized the similarities between \"The Prince\" and the genre it obviously imitates, the so-called \"Mirror of Princes\" style. This was a classically influenced genre, with models at least as far back as Xenophon and Isocrates. While Gilbert emphasized the similarities, however, he agreed with all other commentators that Machiavelli was particularly novel in the way he used this genre, even when compared to his contemporaries such as Baldassare Castiglione and Erasmus. One of the major innovations Gilbert noted was that Machiavelli focused upon the \"deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom\". Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. (Xenophon is also an exception in this regard.)\n\n2. Classical republicanism. Commentators such as Quentin Skinner and J.G.A. Pocock, in the so-called \"Cambridge School\" of interpretation, have been able to show that some of the republican themes in Machiavelli's political works, particularly the \"Discourses on Livy\", can be found in medieval Italian literature which was influenced by classical authors such as Sallust.\n\n3. Classical political philosophy: Xenophon, Plato and Aristotle. The Socratic school of classical political philosophy, especially Aristotle, had become a major influence upon European political thinking in the late Middle Ages. It existed both in the Catholicised form presented by Thomas Aquinas, and in the more controversial \"Averroist\" form of authors like Marsilius of Padua. Machiavelli was critical of Catholic political thinking and may have been influenced by Averroism. But he cites Plato and Aristotle very infrequently and apparently did not approve of them. Leo Strauss argued that the strong influence of Xenophon, a student of Socrates more known as an historian, rhetorician and soldier, was a major source of Socratic ideas for Machiavelli, sometimes not in line with Aristotle. While interest in Plato was increasing in Florence during Machiavelli's lifetime, Machiavelli does not show particular interest in him, but was indirectly influenced by his readings of authors such as Polybius, Plutarch and Cicero.\n\nThe major difference between Machiavelli and the Socratics, according to Strauss, is Machiavelli's materialism, and therefore his rejection of both a teleological view of nature and of the view that philosophy is higher than politics. With their teleological understanding of things, Socratics argued that desirable things tend to happen by nature, as if nature desired them, but Machiavelli claimed that such things happen by blind chance or human action.\n\n4. Classical materialism. Strauss argued that Machiavelli may have seen himself as influenced by some ideas from classical materialists such as Democritus, Epicurus and Lucretius. Strauss however sees this also as a sign of major innovation in Machiavelli, because classical materialists did not share the Socratic regard for political life, while Machiavelli clearly did.\n\n5. Thucydides.\nSome scholars note the similarity between Machiavelli and the Greek historian Thucydides, since both emphasized power politics. Strauss argued that Machiavelli may indeed have been influenced by pre-Socratic philosophers, but he felt it was a new combination:-\n...contemporary readers are reminded by Machiavelli's teaching of Thucydides; they find in both authors the same \"realism,\" i.e., the same denial of the power of the gods or of justice and the same sensitivity to harsh necessity and elusive chance. Yet Thucydides never calls in question the intrinsic superiority of nobility to baseness, a superiority that shines forth particularly when the noble is destroyed by the base. Therefore Thucydides' History arouses in the reader a sadness which is never aroused by Machiavelli's books. In Machiavelli we find comedies, parodies, and satires but nothing reminding of tragedy. One half of humanity remains outside of his thought. There is no tragedy in Machiavelli because he has no sense of the sacredness of \"the common.\" — \n\nAmongst commentators, there are a few consistently made proposals concerning what was most new in Machiavelli's work.\n\nMachiavelli is sometimes seen as the prototype of a modern empirical scientist, building generalizations from experience and historical facts, and emphasizing the uselessness of theorizing with the imagination.\n\nMachiavelli felt that his early schooling along the lines of a traditional classical education was essentially useless for the purpose of understanding politics. Nevertheless, he advocated intensive study of the past, particularly regarding the founding of a city, which he felt was a key to understanding its later development. Moreover, he studied the way people lived and aimed to inform leaders how they should rule and even how they themselves should live. For example, Machiavelli denies that living virtuously necessarily leads to happiness. And Machiavelli viewed misery as \"one of the vices that enables a prince to rule.\" Machiavelli stated that \"it would be best to be both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved.\" In much of Machiavelli's work, it seems that the ruler must adopt unsavory policies for the sake of the continuance of his regime.\n\nA related and more controversial proposal often made is that he described how to do things in politics in a way which seemed neutral concerning who used the advice—tyrants or good rulers. That Machiavelli strove for realism is not doubted, but for four centuries scholars have debated how best to describe his morality. \"The Prince\" made the word \"Machiavellian\" a byword for deceit, despotism, and political manipulation. Even if Machiavelli was not himself evil, Leo Strauss declared himself inclined toward the traditional view that Machiavelli was self-consciously a \"teacher of evil,\" since he counsels the princes to avoid the values of justice, mercy, temperance, wisdom, and love of their people in preference to the use of cruelty, violence, fear, and deception. Italian anti-fascist philosopher Benedetto Croce (1925) concludes Machiavelli is simply a \"realist\" or \"pragmatist\" who accurately states that moral values in reality do not greatly affect the decisions that political leaders make. German philosopher Ernst Cassirer (1946) held that Machiavelli simply adopts the stance of a political scientist—a Galileo of politics—in distinguishing between the \"facts\" of political life and the \"values\" of moral judgment. On the other hand, Walter Russell Mead has argued that \"The Prince\"s advice presupposes the importance of ideas like legitimacy in making changes to the political system.\n\nMachiavelli is generally seen as being critical of Christianity as it existed in his time, specifically its effect upon politics, and also everyday life. In his opinion, Christianity, along with the teleological Aristotelianism that the church had come to accept, allowed practical decisions to be guided too much by imaginary ideals and encouraged people to lazily leave events up to providence or, as he would put it, chance, luck or fortune. While Christianity sees modesty as a virtue and pride as sinful, Machiavelli took a more classical position, seeing ambition, spiritedness, and the pursuit of glory as good and natural things, and part of the virtue and prudence that good princes should have. Therefore, while it was traditional to say that leaders should have virtues, especially prudence, Machiavelli's use of the words \"virtù\" and \"prudenza\" was unusual for his time, implying a spirited and immodest ambition. Famously, Machiavelli argued that virtue and prudence can help a man control more of his future, in the place of allowing fortune to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, humanism in Machiavelli's time meant that classical pre-Christian ideas about virtue and prudence, including the possibility of trying to control one's future, were not unique to him. But humanists did not go so far as to promote the extra glory of deliberately aiming to establish a new state, in defiance of traditions and laws.\n\nWhile Machiavelli's approach had classical precedents, it has been argued that it did more than just bring back old ideas and that Machiavelli was not a typical humanist. argues that the way Machiavelli combines classical ideas is new. While Xenophon and Plato also described realistic politics and were closer to Machiavelli than Aristotle was, they, like Aristotle, also saw Philosophy as something higher than politics. Machiavelli was apparently a materialist who objected to explanations involving formal and final causation, or teleology.\n\nMachiavelli's promotion of ambition among leaders while denying any higher standard meant that he encouraged risk-taking, and innovation, most famously the founding of new modes and orders. His advice to princes was therefore certainly not limited to discussing how to maintain a state. It has been argued that Machiavelli's promotion of innovation led directly to the argument for progress as an aim of politics and civilisation. But while a belief that humanity can control its own future, control nature, and \"progress\" has been long lasting, Machiavelli's followers, starting with his own friend Guicciardini, have tended to prefer peaceful progress through economic development, and not warlike progress. As Harvey wrote: \"In attempting other, more regular and scientific modes of overcoming fortune, Machiavelli's successors formalised and emasculated his notion of virtue.\"\n\nMachiavelli however, along with some of his classical predecessors, saw ambition and spiritedness, and therefore war, as inevitable and part of human nature.\n\nStrauss concludes his 1958 \"Thoughts on Machiavelli\" by proposing that this promotion of progress leads directly to the modern arms race. Strauss argued that the unavoidable nature of such arms races, which have existed before modern times and led to the collapse of peaceful civilisations, provides us with both an explanation of what is most truly dangerous in Machiavelli's innovations, but also the way in which the aims of his apparently immoral innovation can be understood.\n\nMachiavelli explains repeatedly that he saw religion as man-made, and that the value of religion lies in its contribution to social order and the rules of morality must be dispensed with if security requires it. In \"The Prince,\" the \"Discourses,\" and in the \"Life of Castruccio Castracani,\" he describes \"prophets\", as he calls them, like Moses, Romulus, Cyrus the Great, and Theseus (he treated pagan and Christian patriarchs in the same way) as the greatest of new princes, the glorious and brutal founders of the most novel innovations in politics, and men whom Machiavelli assures us have always used a large amount of armed force and murder against their own people. He estimated that these sects last from 1,666 to 3,000 years each time, which, as pointed out by Leo Strauss, would mean that Christianity became due to start finishing about 150 years after Machiavelli. Machiavelli's concern with Christianity as a sect was that it makes men weak and inactive, delivering politics into the hands of cruel and wicked men without a fight.\n\nWhile fear of God can be replaced by fear of the prince, if there is a strong enough prince, Machiavelli felt that having a religion is in any case especially essential to keeping a republic in order. For Machiavelli, a truly great prince can never be conventionally religious himself, but he should make his people religious if he can. According to he was not the first person to ever explain religion in this way, but his description of religion was novel because of the way he integrated this into his general account of princes.\n\nMachiavelli's judgment that democracies need religion for practical political reasons was widespread among modern proponents of republics until approximately the time of the French Revolution. This therefore represents a point of disagreement between himself and late modernity.\n\nDespite the classical precedents, which Machiavelli was not the only one to promote in his time, Machiavelli's realism and willingness to argue that good ends justify bad things, is seen as a critical stimulus towards some of the most important theories of modern politics.\n\nFirstly, particularly in the \"Discourses on Livy,\" Machiavelli is unusual in the positive side he sometimes seems to describe in factionalism in republics. For example, quite early in the \"Discourses,\" (in Book I, chapter 4), a chapter title announces that \"the disunion\" of the plebs and senate in Rome \"kept Rome free.\" That a community has different components whose interests must be balanced in any good regime is an idea with classical precedents, but Machiavelli's particularly extreme presentation is seen as a critical step towards the later political ideas of both a division of powers or checks and balances, ideas which lay behind the US constitution, as well as many other modern state constitutions.\n\nSimilarly, the modern economic argument for capitalism, and most modern forms of economics, was often stated in the form of \"public virtue from private vices.\" Also in this case, even though there are classical precedents, Machiavelli's insistence on being both realistic and ambitious, not only admitting that vice exists but being willing to risk encouraging it, is a critical step on the path to this insight.\n\nMansfield however argues that Machiavelli's own aims have not been shared by those he influenced. Machiavelli argued against seeing mere peace and economic growth as worthy aims on their own, if they would lead to what Mansfield calls the \"taming of the prince.\"\n\nMachiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, \"The Prince\", written in 1513 but not published until 1532, five years after his death. Although he privately circulated \"The Prince\" among friends, the only theoretical work to be printed in his lifetime was \"The Art of War\", which was about military science. Since the 16th century, generations of politicians remain attracted and repelled by its apparently neutral acceptance, or even positive encouragement, of the immorality of powerful men, described especially in \"The Prince\" but also in his other works.\n\nHis works are sometimes even said to have contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words \"politics\" and \"politician\", and it is sometimes thought that it is because of him that \"Old Nick\" became an English term for the Devil. More obviously, the adjective \"Machiavellian\" became a term describing someone or something that is \"marked by cunning, duplicity, or bad faith\". \"Machiavellianism\" also remains a popular term used in speeches and journalism; while in psychology, it denotes a personality type.\n\nWhile Machiavellianism is notable in the works of Machiavelli, Machiavelli's works are complex and he is generally agreed to have been more than just \"Machiavellian\" himself. For example, J.G.A. saw him as a major source of the republicanism that spread throughout England and North America in the 17th and 18th centuries and Leo , whose view of Machiavelli is quite different in many ways, agreed about Machiavelli's influence on republicanism and argued that even though Machiavelli was a teacher of evil he had a nobility of spirit that led him to advocate ignoble actions. Whatever his intentions, which are still debated today, he has become associated with any proposal where \"the end justifies the means\". For example, Leo wrote:\n\nTo quote Robert Bireley:\n\nMachiavelli's ideas had a profound impact on political leaders throughout the modern west, helped by the new technology of the printing press. During the first generations after Machiavelli, his main influence was in non-Republican governments. Pole reported that \"The Prince\" was spoken of highly by Thomas Cromwell in England and had influenced Henry VIII in his turn towards Protestantism, and in his tactics, for example during the Pilgrimage of Grace. A copy was also possessed by the Catholic king and emperor Charles V. In France, after an initially mixed reaction, Machiavelli came to be associated with Catherine de' Medici and the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. As reports, in the 16th century, Catholic writers \"associated Machiavelli with the Protestants, whereas Protestant authors saw him as Italian and Catholic\". In fact, he was apparently influencing both Catholic and Protestant kings.\n\nOne of the most important early works dedicated to criticism of Machiavelli, especially \"The Prince\", was that of the Huguenot, Innocent Gentillet, whose work commonly referred to as \"Discourse against Machiavelli\" or \"Anti Machiavel\" was published in Geneva in 1576. He accused Machiavelli of being an atheist and accused politicians of his time by saying that his works were the \"Koran of the courtiers\", that \"he is of no reputation in the court of France which hath not Machiavel's writings at the fingers ends\". Another theme of Gentillet was more in the spirit of Machiavelli himself: he questioned the effectiveness of immoral strategies (just as Machiavelli had himself done, despite also explaining how they could sometimes work). This became the theme of much future political discourse in Europe during the 17th century. This includes the Catholic Counter Reformation writers summarised by Bireley: Giovanni Botero, Justus Lipsius, Carlo Scribani, Adam Contzen, Pedro de Ribadeneira, and Diego Saavedra Fajardo. These authors criticized Machiavelli, but also followed him in many ways. They accepted the need for a prince to be concerned with reputation, and even a need for cunning and deceit, but compared to Machiavelli, and like later modernist writers, they emphasized economic progress much more than the riskier ventures of war. These authors tended to cite Tacitus as their source for realist political advice, rather than Machiavelli, and this pretense came to be known as \"Tacitism\". \"Black tacitism\" was in support of princely rule, but \"red tacitism\" arguing the case for republics, more in the original spirit of Machiavelli himself, became increasingly important.\nModern materialist philosophy developed in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, starting in the generations after Machiavelli. This philosophy tended to be republican, more in the original spirit of Machiavellian, but as with the Catholic authors Machiavelli's realism and encouragement of using innovation to try to control one's own fortune were more accepted than his emphasis upon war and politics. Not only was innovative economics and politics a result, but also modern science, leading some commentators to say that the 18th century Enlightenment involved a \"humanitarian\" moderating of Machiavellianism.\n\nThe importance of Machiavelli's influence is notable in many important figures in this endeavor, for example Bodin, Francis Bacon, Algernon Sidney, Harrington, John Milton, Spinoza, Rousseau, Hume, Edward Gibbon, and Adam Smith. Although he was not always mentioned by name as an inspiration, due to his controversy, he is also thought to have been an influence for other major philosophers, such as Montaigne, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke and Montesquieu.\n\nAlthough Jean-Jacques Rousseau is associated with very different political ideas, it is important to view Machiavelli's work from different points of view rather than just the traditional notion. For example, Rousseau viewed Machiavelli's work as a satirical piece in which Machiavelli exposes the faults of a one-man rule rather than exalting amorality.\n\nIn the seventeenth century it was in England that Machiavelli's ideas were most substantially developed and adapted, and that republicanism came once more to life; and out of seventeenth-century English republicanism there were to emerge in the next century not only a theme of English political and historical reflection—of the writings of the Bolingbroke circle and of Gibbon and of early parliamentary radicals—but a stimulus to the Enlightenment in Scotland, on the Continent, and in America.\n\nScholars have argued that Machiavelli was a major indirect and direct influence upon the political thinking of the Founding Fathers of the United States due to his overwhelming favoritism of republicanism and the republic type of government. According to John McCormick, it is still very much debatable whether or not Machiavelli was \"an advisor of tyranny or partisan of liberty.\" Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson followed Machiavelli's republicanism when they opposed what they saw as the emerging aristocracy that they feared Alexander Hamilton was creating with the Federalist Party. Hamilton learned from Machiavelli about the importance of foreign policy for domestic policy, but may have broken from him regarding how rapacious a republic needed to be in order to survive George Washington was less influenced by Machiavelli.\n\nThe Founding Father who perhaps most studied and valued Machiavelli as a political philosopher was John Adams, who profusely commented on the Italian's thought in his work, \"A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America\". In this work, John Adams praised Machiavelli, with Algernon Sidney and Montesquieu, as a philosophic defender of mixed government. For Adams, Machiavelli restored empirical reason to politics, while his analysis of factions was commendable. Adams likewise agreed with the Florentine that human nature was immutable and driven by passions. He also accepted Machiavelli's belief that all societies were subject to cyclical periods of growth and decay. For Adams, Machiavelli lacked only a clear understanding of the institutions necessary for good government.\n\nThe 20th-century Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci drew great inspiration from Machiavelli's writings on ethics, morals, and how they relate to the State and revolution in his writings on Passive Revolution, and how a society can be manipulated by controlling popular notions of morality.\n\nJoseph Stalin read \"The Prince\" and annotated his own copy.\n\nIn the 20th century there was also renewed interest in Machiavelli's \"La Mandragola\" (1518), which received numerous stagings, including several in New York, at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1976 and the Riverside Shakespeare Company in 1979, as a musical comedy by Peer Raben in Munich's antiteater in 1971, and at London's National Theatre in 1984.\n\nMachiavelli's best-known book \"Il Principe\" contains several maxims concerning politics. Instead of the more traditional target audience of a hereditary prince, it concentrates on the possibility of a \"new prince\". To retain power, the hereditary prince must carefully balance the interests of a variety of institutions to which the people are accustomed. By contrast, a new prince has the more difficult task in ruling: He must first stabilise his newfound power in order to build an enduring political structure. Machiavelli suggests that the social benefits of stability and security can be achieved in the face of moral corruption. Machiavelli believed that public and private morality had to be understood as two different things in order to rule well. As a result, a ruler must be concerned not only with reputation, but also must be positively willing to act immorally at the right times. Machiavelli believed as a ruler, it was better to be widely feared than to be greatly loved; A loved ruler retains authority by obligation while a feared leader rules by fear of punishment. As a political theorist, Machiavelli emphasized the occasional need for the methodical exercise of brute force or deceit including extermination of entire noble families to head off any chance of a challenge to the prince's authority.\n\nScholars often note that Machiavelli glorifies instrumentality in state building, an approach embodied by the saying \"The ends justify the means.\" This quote has been disputed and may not come from Niccolò Machiavelli or his writings. Violence may be necessary for the successful stabilisation of power and introduction of new legal institutions. Force may be used to eliminate political rivals, to coerce resistant populations, and to purge the community of other men strong enough of a character to rule, who will inevitably attempt to replace the ruler. Machiavelli has become infamous for such political advice, ensuring that he would be remembered in history through the adjective, \"Machiavellian\".\n\nNotwithstanding some mitigating themes, the Catholic Church banned \"The Prince\", putting it on the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\". Humanists also viewed the book negatively, including Erasmus of Rotterdam. As a treatise, its primary intellectual contribution to the history of political thought is the fundamental break between political realism and political idealism, due to it being a manual on acquiring and keeping political power. In contrast with Plato and Aristotle, Machiavelli insisted that an imaginary ideal society is not a model by which a prince should orient himself.\n\nConcerning the differences and similarities in Machiavelli's advice to ruthless and tyrannical princes in \"The Prince\" and his more republican exhortations in \"Discourses on Livy\", many have concluded that \"The Prince\", although written as advice for a monarchical prince, contains arguments for the superiority of republican regimes, similar to those found in the \"Discourses\". In the 18th century, the work was even called a satire, for example by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. More recently, commentators such as Leo Strauss and Harvey Mansfield have agreed that \"The Prince\" can be read as having a deliberate comical irony.\n\nOther interpretations include for example that of Antonio Gramsci, who argued that Machiavelli's audience for this work was not even the ruling class but the common people because the rulers already knew these methods through their education.\n\nThe \"Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy\", published in 1531, written 1517, often referred to simply as the \"Discourses\" or \"Discorsi\", is nominally a discussion regarding the classical history of early Ancient Rome although it strays very far from this subject matter and also uses contemporary political examples to illustrate points. Machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic \"should\" be started and structured. It is a larger work than \"The Prince\", and while it more openly explains the advantages of republics, it also contains many similar themes. Commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other, frequently referring to leaders of democracies as \"princes\". It includes early versions of the concept of checks and balances and asserts the superiority of a republic over a principality. It became one of the central texts of republicanism, and has often been argued to be a superior work to \"The Prince\".\n\nFrom \"The Discourses\":\n\n\nBesides being a statesman and political scientist, Machiavelli also translated classical works, and was a playwright (\"Clizia\", \"Mandragola\"), a poet (\"Sonetti\", \"Canzoni\", \"Ottave\", \"Canti carnascialeschi\"), and a novelist (\"Belfagor arcidiavolo\").\n\nSome of his other work:\n\n\"Della Lingua\" (Italian for \"Of the Language\") (1514), a dialogue about Italy's language is normally attributed to Machiavelli.\n\nMachiavelli's literary executor, Giuliano de' Ricci, also reported having seen that Machiavelli, his grandfather, made a comedy in the style of Aristophanes which included living Florentines as characters, and to be titled \"Le Maschere\". It has been suggested that due to such things as this and his style of writing to his superiors generally, there was very likely some animosity to Machiavelli even before the return of the Medici.\n\nChristopher Marlowe's play \"The Jew of Malta\" (ca. 1589) contains a prologue by a character called Machiavel, a Senecan ghost based on Machiavelli. Machiavel expresses the cynical view that power is amoral, saying \"I count religion but a childish toy,/And hold there is no sin but ignorance.\"\n\nNiccolò Machiavelli plays a vital role in the young adult book series \"The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel\". He is an immortal working in national security for the French government.\n\nNiccolò Machiavelli aids Cesare Borgia and protagonist Nicholas Dawson in their dangerous intrigues in Cecelia Holland's 1979 historical novel \"City of God\". David Maclaine writes that in the novel, Machiavelli \"is an off-stage presence whose spirit permeates this work of intrigue and betrayal ... It is a brilliant introduction to the people and events that gave us the word 'Machiavellian.'\" Machiavelli appears as an Immortal adversary of Duncan MacLeod in Nancy Holder's 1997 \"Highlander\" novel \"The Measure of a Man\", and is a character in Michael Scott's novel series \"The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel\" (2007–2012). Machiavelli is also one of the main characters in \"The Enchantress of Florence\" (2008) by Salman Rushdie, mostly referred to as \"Niccolò 'il Macchia\", and the central protagonist in the 2012 novel \"The Malice of Fortune\" by Michael Ennis.\n\nTelevision dramas centering on the early Renaissance have also made use of Machiavelli to underscore his influence in early modern political philosophy. Machiavelli has been featured as a supporting character in \"The Tudors\" (2007–2010), Borgia (2011–2014) and \"The Borgias\" (2011–2013).\n\nMachiavelli appears in the popular historical video games \"Assassin's Creed II\" (2009) and \"\" (2010), in which he is portrayed as a member of the secret society of Assassins.\n\nA highly fictionalised version of Machiavelli appears in the BBC children's TV series \"Leonardo\" (2011–2012), in which he is \"Mac\", a black streetwise hustler who is best friends with fellow teenagers Leonardo da Vinci, Mona Lisa, and Lorenzo di Medici. In the 2013 episode \"Ewings Unite!\" of the television series \"Dallas\", legendary oil baron J.R. Ewing wills his copy of \"The Prince\" to his adopted nephew Christopher Ewing, telling him to \"use it, because being smart and sneaky is an unbeatable combination.\" In \"Da Vinci's Demons\" (2013–2015)—an American historical fantasy drama series that presents a fictional account of Leonardo da Vinci's early life—Eros Vlahos plays a young Niccolò \"Nico\" Machiavelli, although the character's full name is not revealed until the finale of the second season.\n\nThe 1967 \"The Time Tunnel\" episode \"The Death Merchant\" stars famed character actor Malachi Throne as Niccolò Machiavelli, who has been time-displaced to the Battle of Gettysburg. The character's personality and behaviour seem to portray Cesare Borgia rather than Machiavelli himself, suggesting that the writers may have confused the two.\n\nMachiavelli is played by Damian Lewis in the 2013 BBC radio play \"The Prince\" written by Jonathan Myerson. Together with his defence attorney Lucrezia Borgia (Helen McCrory), he presents examples from history to the devil to support his political theories and appeal his sentence in Hell.\n\nThe historical novel \"The City of Man\" (2009) by author Michael Harrington fully portrays the complex personalities of the two main characters—Girolamo Savonarola and a formative Niccolò Machiavelli—in opposition during the turbulent last decade of 15th century Florence. The portrayal of Machiavelli draws from his later writings and observations of the chaotic events of his youth before rising from obscurity to be appointed as Second Chancellor of the Florentine Republic at the age of twenty-nine, only one month after Savonarola's execution. Major characters include Lorenzo de' Medici, his son Piero, Michelangelo, Sandro Botticelli, Pico della Mirandola, Marsilio Ficino, Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia), Cesare Borgia (model for The Prince), Piero and Tommaso Soderini, Il Cronaca and the diarist, Luca Landucci.\n\nThe American rapper Tupac Shakur studied Machiavelli while in prison and became greatly influenced by his work. Upon his release from prison, Tupac honored Machiavelli in 1996 by changing his own rap name from 2Pac to Makaveli.\n\nIn the 1993 crime drama \"A Bronx Tale\", local mob boss Sonny tells his young protege Calogero that while he was doing a 10-year sentence in jail, he passed the time and stayed out of trouble by reading Machiavelli, whom he describes as \"a famous writer from 500 years ago\"—and then tells him how Machiavelli's philosophy, including his famous advice about how it is preferable for a leader to be feared rather than loved if he cannot be both—have made him a successful mob boss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His parents were Claus Felix von Amsberg and Baroness Gösta von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen. His father, a member of the untitled German nobility, operated a large farm in Tanganyika (formerly German East Africa) from 1928 until World War II. From 1938 Claus and his six sisters grew up on their maternal grandparents' manor in Lower Saxony; he attended the Friderico-Francisceum-Gymnasium in Bad Doberan from 1933 to 1936 and a boarding school in Tanganyika from 1936 to 1938.\n\nClaus was a member of such Nazi youth organisations as Deutsches Jungvolk and the Hitler Youth (membership in both was mandatory for all fit members of his generation). From 1938 until 1942, he attended the Baltenschule Misdroy.\n\nIn 1944, he was conscripted into the German Wehrmacht, becoming a soldier in the German 90th Panzergrenadier Division in Italy in March 1945. He was taken prisoner of war by the American forces at Meran before taking part in any fighting. After his repatriation, he finished school in Lüneburg and studied law in Hamburg. He then joined the German diplomatic corps and worked in Santo Domingo and Ivory Coast. In the 1960s, he was transferred to Bonn.\n\nClaus met Princess Beatrix for the first time on New Year's Eve 1962 in Bad Driburg at a dinner hosted by the count von Oeynhausen-Sierstorpff who was a distant relative of both of them. They met again at the wedding-eve party of Princess Tatjana of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse, in the summer of 1964. With memories of German oppression still very strong 20 years after the war, sections of the Dutch population were unhappy that Beatrix's fiancé was a German and former member of the Hitler Youth. Nonetheless, Queen Juliana gave the engagement her blessing after giving serious thought to canceling it. The engagement was approved by the States-General—a necessary step for Beatrix to remain heiress to the throne—in 1965. He was granted Dutch citizenship later that year and changed the spellings of his names to Dutch.\n\nThe pair were married on 10 March 1966. Their wedding day saw violent protests, most notably by the anarchist-artist group Provo. They included such memorable slogans as \"Claus, 'raus!\" (Claus, get out!) and \"Mijn fiets terug\" (Give me back my bike), a reference to the memory of occupying German soldiers confiscating Dutch bicycles. A smoke bomb was thrown at the wedding carriage by a group of Provos. For a time, it was thought that Beatrix would be the last monarch of the Netherlands.\n\nHowever, over time, Claus became accepted by the public, so much so that during the last part of his life he was considered by some to be the most popular member of the Royal Family. This change in Dutch opinion was brought about by Claus's strong motivation to contribute to public causes (especially Third World development, on which he was considered an expert), his sincere modesty and his candor (within but sometimes on the edge of royal protocol).\n\nThe public also sympathised with Claus for his efforts to give meaning to his life beyond the restrictions that Dutch law imposed on the Royal Family's freedom of speech and action. However, these restrictions were gradually loosened; Claus was even appointed as senior staff member at the Department of Developing Aid, albeit in an advisory role.\n\nOne example of his attitude toward protocol was the \"Declaration of the Tie\". In 1998, after presenting the annual Prince Claus Awards to three African fashion designers, Claus told \"workers of all nations to unite and cast away the new shackles they have voluntarily cast upon themselves\", meaning the necktie, that \"snake around my neck,\" and encouraged the audience to \"venture into open-collar paradise\". He then removed his tie and threw it on the floor.\n\nClaus battled depression for a number of years, and underwent a surgery in 1998 to remove his prostate. In 2001, he underwent another surgery to remove one of his kidneys. He eventually died on 6 October 2002 from Parkinson's disease and heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrince Claus was also appointed Honorary Fellow of the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) in 1988. Prince Claus was held in very high esteem in the international development cooperation community, partly because of his considerable insight and understanding of the problems involved, and partly because of his exceptional gift for expressing the hopes and anxieties felt by all.\n\nClaus suffered various health problems, such as depression, cancer and Parkinson's disease. He died of complications of pneumonia and Parkinson's at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam on 6 October 2002 after a long illness, aged 76. He died less than 4 months after the birth of his first grandchild.\n\nHe was interred in the Royal Family's tomb in Delft on 15 October. It was the first full state funeral since Queen Wilhelmina's in 1962.\n\n"}

He was the first Indian to fly in a balloon and land in a parachute. He was also the first Indian to take up ballooning as a profession. His daring acts with the balloon and the parachute made him a national hero.\n\nRam Chandra Chatterjee was a resident of Kansaripara, in the locality of Shimulia in North Kolkata. He started his career as an acrobat in the National Circus Company of Nabagopal Mitra, the founder of Hindu Mela. He was a flying trapeze player. Later he became the director of Great United Indian Circus Company. He also worked as teacher of gymnastics in the Government Normal School.\n\nWhen Percival G. Spencer, a British balloonist arrived in Kolkata for his show, Chatterjee requested him to teach the art of ballooning. Spencer complied and Chatterjee had to pay him five hundred rupees for that.\n\nHe took the first flight with Percival Spencer on 10 April 1889, in the balloon named 'The Viceroy' from the grounds of the Oriental Gas Company in Narkeldanga. The Viceroy was filled with 20,000 cu.ft. of coal gas from a 6-inch gas main under the supervision of D. Coats Niven, the director of the gas company. The balloon took off at 3-30 PM and after an hour's journey they descended at the village of Palpakira-Kazipara, three miles away from Barasat.\n\nThe flight was reported in all the local newspapers and he was heralded as the first Indian aeronaut. Chatterjee was sponsored by Gopal Chandra Mukherjee, the maternal grandson of Jatindramohan Tagore, the landlord of Pathuriaghata and M. Mullick. After the successful flight Chatterjee announced his intention to run a balloon of his own and to make an extensive tour of India.\n\nThereafter, Chatterjee purchased 'The Viceroy' from Spencer and christened it 'The City of Calcutta'. He also floated the Calcutta Balloonists Company and announced his intention to make the first solo ascent on 27 April 1889. However, due to bad weather the flight was postponed till 4 May. A week later arrived the D-Day. A capacity crowd of 8,000 gathered to witness the spectacular event at the gas works grounds in Narkeldanga. J. Reid, the assistant manager of the gas company supervised the filling of the balloon. Clad in a light suit, with a binocular around his neck Chatterjee waved his cap as the balloon took off at 5-10 PM. After flying for 40 minutes in the northerly direction, he descended at Natagore, a village two miles from Sodepur. The account of the trip was published in The Bengalee on 11 May.\n\nVery soon, Chatterjee decided to embark upon the career of a professional balloonist and launched the Chatterjee's Ballooning Company for the purpose. He made himself open to engagements at any place where gas was available. He intended to visit Allahabad, Lahore, Jaipur, Lucknow, Dhaka and Kashmir.\n\nOn 27 June 1889, Chatterjee made his second solo ascent in 'The City of Calcutta' from Khusrobagh in Allahabad. A capacity crowd of 10,000 had gathered to witness the spectacular event. But due to insufficient filling or poor quality of the gas, the balloon failed to take off, even when all the ballasts were completely removed from the basket. As a true professional, he decided not to dishearten the crowd. He, therefore, detached the basket and clung to the steel hoof and made the ascent. It was a daring act, as without the basket the descent was extremely treacherous, but with his courage and pluck he was able to land with ease.\n\nOn 22 March 1890, Chatterjee set off in 'The Empress of India', fitted with a parachute from the Tivoli Gardens, near Minto Park in Kolkata at 5-30PM. And then arrived the moment he made history, when he leaped from an altitude of 3,500 ft and landed by parachute. The event was attended by His Excellency, the Amban, the Chinese Ambassador, Percival Spencer, Abanindranath Tagore and Yogindranath Sarkar. After the successful descent in a parachute, Chatterjee was given a public reception.\n\nThe City of Calcutta was not meant for parachuting and Chatterjee therefore procured one for the purpose. He renamed it 'Star of India'.\n\nIn November 1890, he made an ascent from Tis Hazari in Delhi and descended in the parachute, which earned him a prestigious reward from Nawab Jalal-ud-Dowlah Muhammad Mumtiaz Ali Khan. He repeated his feat on 8 March 1891 in Lahore and then in Rawalpindi. At his next stop in Indore he performed his feat on November, 1891 at the request of the Maharaja of Indore in presence of the Viceroy. He followed it up in Agra in February 1892 and Varanasi in April 1892.\n\nHe met with a serious accident while performing the show in a native state, when his balloon collided with a hill. He was rushed to Kolkata, where he died in Gopal Chandra Mukherjee's garden house on 9 August 1892.\n\nChatterjee's remarkable feats inspired his compatriots into embracing the new adventure game. Prabodh Chandra Laha ascended the sky alongside Spencer in 'The City of York' on 15 February 1890 from Kolkata. He followed it up with a solo ascent on 8 March in 'The Viceroy of India' which he subsequently purchased from Spencer. Laha made another successful attempt from Kanpur in March 1892.\n\nThe third Indian balloonist happened to be Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri, the famous barrister, professor at the Metropolitan College and son-in-law of Surendranath Banerjee. He was the first Indian to make an ascent for scientific purposes.\n\nMajor Harry Hobbs, a long-time resident of Kolkata has mentioned in his memoirs that Ram Chandra Chatterjee's daughter was also as plucky as her father and she also flew balloons several times.\n"}

The village is made up of a two kilometre (1¼ mi) coastal belt between Puthenkadapuram and Kettungal in Parappanangadi. The village is named after former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, in an act of solidarity during the 1991 Gulf War. The beach name was suggested by Indian maids working in the gulf, especially Kuwait.\n\nThe village used to be called Tipu Sultan Beach after the Mysore king Tippu Sultan who took an aggressive stance against the British colonial forces during the late 18th century. Since the Gulf War of 1991, the villagers have decided to rename the village to its present name, expressing solidarity with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The villagers, mostly Muslim, claim to be inspired by \"Saddam and his fight against policies of the United States.\n\nThe coastal hamlet that is now Saddam Beach shot into prominence when it was renamed after the Iraqi leader. The villagers of the region have since been particularly vocal about their admiration of Saddam and his 'anti-imperialist' stance. The United States-led invasion of Iraq was received with much condemnation. In 2003, expressing anguish over the renaming of \"Saddam International Airport\" to \"Baghdad International Airport\", some Saddam fans raised a large signpost on the beach with the message \"Welcome to Saddam Beach\".\n\nDuring the course of the invasion of Baghdad, the village witnessed many anti-American and anti-British demonstrations. Goods made in these countries were generally boycotted and even thrown into the sea. Many of the villagers who had work in Gulf countries were forced to return to Saddam Beach as their jobs were lost due to the aftereffects of the Gulf War, further increasing animosity to the West. Large cut-outs and posters of Saddam, along with Iraqi flags were erected along the roadside by the locals, marking their protest.\n\nIn November 2006, villagers reacted to the death sentence of Saddam Hussein by staging a protest rally, mouthing slogans against American President George W. Bush. Around fifty people, including women and children, participated in the march.\n\nOn 30 December 2006, angry supporters of Saddam Hussein gathered at the beach, and shouted slogans denouncing US President George W. Bush, describing the execution of Saddam Hussein as \"cruel\"\n\nSaddam Beach village is a predominantly Muslim populated area. Hindus exist in comparatively smaller numbers. So the culture of the locality is based upon Muslim traditions. Duff Muttu, Kolkali and Aravanamuttu are common folk arts of this locality. There are many libraries attached to mosques giving a rich source of Islamic studies. Most of the books are written in Arabi-Malayalam which is a version of the Malayalam language written in Arabic script. People gather in mosques for the evening prayer and continue to sit there after the prayers discussing social and cultural issues. Business and family issues are also sorted out during these evening meetings. The Hindu minority of this area keeps their rich traditions by celebrating various festivals in their temples. Hindu rituals are done here with a regular devotion like other parts of Kerala.\n\nSaddam Beach village connects to other parts of India through Parappanangadi town. National highway No.66 passes through Ramanattukara and the northern stretch connects to Goa and Mumbai. The southern stretch connects to Cochin and Trivandrum. State Highway No.28 starts from Nilambur and connects to Ooty, Mysore and Bangalore through Highways.12,29 and 181. The nearest airport is at Kozhikode. The nearest major railway station is at Parappanangadi.\n"}
{"id": "1847198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847198", "title": "Sadiq Khan", "text": "Sadiq Khan\n\nSadiq Aman Khan (; born 8 October 1970) is a British politician serving as Mayor of London since 2016. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tooting from 2005 to 2016. A member of the Labour Party and its regional London Labour Party, he is on the party's soft left wing and has been ideologically characterised as a social democrat.\n\nBorn in Tooting, South London, to a working-class British Pakistani family, Khan earned a law degree from the University of North London. He subsequently worked as a solicitor specialising in human rights, and chaired Liberty for three years. Joining the Labour Party, Khan was a Councillor for the London Borough of Wandsworth from 1994 to 2006 before being elected as Member of Parliament for Tooting at the 2005 general election. Under the Labour government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Khan was appointed Minister of State for Communities in 2008, later becoming Minister of State for Transport. A key ally of former Labour leader Ed Miliband, he served in the Miliband's Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, Shadow Lord Chancellor, and Shadow Minister for London.\n\nKhan was elected Mayor of London at the May 2016 mayoral election, succeeding Conservative Party mayor Boris Johnson. He immediately resigned as MP for Tooting upon his victory at the mayoral election. He is London's first ethnic minority mayor. Khan won the largest number of votes in one election of any politician in British history. As mayor, he has introduced reforms to limit charges on London's public transport, backed London Gatwick Airport expansion, and focused on uniting the city's varied communities. He was a vocal supporter of the unsuccessful Britain Stronger in Europe campaign to retain UK membership of the European Union. He has been included in the \"Time\" 100 list of world's most influential people.\n\nKhan was born on 8 October 1970 at St George's Hospital in Tooting, South London to a working-class Sunni Muslim family. His grandparents migrated from Lucknow in United Provinces, British India to Pakistan following the partition of India in 1947.\nHis father Amanullah and mother Sehrun arrived in London from Pakistan in 1968. Khan was the fifth of eight children, all but one of whom were boys. In the city, Amanullah worked as a bus driver and Sehrun as a seamstress.\nKhan and his siblings grew up in a three-bedroom council flat on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield. He attended Fircroft Primary School and then Ernest Bevin School, a local comprehensive. Khan studied science and mathematics at A-level, in the hope of eventually becoming a dentist. A teacher recommended that he read law instead, as he had an argumentative personality. The teacher's suggestion, along with the American television programme \"L.A. Law\", inspired Khan to do so. He read Law at the University of North London (now London Metropolitan University). His parents later moved out of their council flat and purchased their own home. Like his brothers, Khan was a fan of sport, particularly enjoying football, cricket, and boxing.\n\nFrom his earliest years, Khan worked: \"I was surrounded by my mum and dad working all the time, so as soon as I could get a job, I got a job. I got a paper round, a Saturday job—some summers I laboured on a building site.\" The family continues to send money to relatives in Pakistan, \"because we're blessed being in this country.\" He and his family often encountered racism..., which led to him and his brothers taking up boxing at the Earlsfield Amateur Boxing Club. While studying for his degree, between the ages of 18 and 21, he had a Saturday job at the Peter Jones department store in Sloane Square.\n\nBefore entering the House of Commons in 2005, Khan practised as a solicitor.\nAfter completing his law degree in 1991, Khan took his Law Society finals at the College of Law in Guildford. In 1994 he married Saadiya Ahmed, who was also a solicitor.\n\nIn 1994 he became a trainee solicitor at a firm of solicitors called \"Christian Fisher\"; the firm specialised in legal aid cases. The partners were Michael Fisher and Louise Christian. Khan became a partner in 1997, and like Christian, specialised in human rights law. When Fisher left in 2002, the firm was renamed \"Christian Khan\". Khan left the firm in 2004, after he became the prospective Labour candidate for the Tooting parliamentary constituency.\n\nDuring his legal career, he acted in actions against employment and discrimination law, judicial reviews, inquests, the police, and crime, and was involved in cases including the following:\n\nBefore entering Parliament, Khan represented Tooting as a Councillor for the London Borough of Wandsworth from 1994 to 2006, and was granted the title of Honorary Alderman of Wandsworth upon his retirement from local politics.\n\nIn 2003, Tooting Constituency Labour Party decided to open its parliamentary selection to all interested candidates, including the incumbent MP since 1974, Tom Cox. This prompted Cox, then in his mid-70s, to announce his retirement rather than risk de-selection. In the subsequent selection contest, Khan defeated five other local candidates to become Labour's candidate for the seat. He was elected to Parliament at the 2005 general election.\n\nKhan was one of the Labour MPs who led the successful opposition to Prime Minister Tony Blair's proposed introduction of 90 days' detention without charge for those suspected of terrorism offences. In recognition of this, \"The Spectator\"—a right-wing magazine then edited by Boris Johnson—awarded him the \"Newcomer of the Year Award\" at the 2005 Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. The magazine's editorial board stated that he had received the award \"for the tough-mindedness and clarity with which he has spoken about the very difficult issues of Islamic terror\". In August 2006, he was a signatory of an open letter to Tony Blair that was signed by prominent Muslims and published in \"The Guardian\". The letter criticised UK foreign policy and in particular the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stating that Blair's policies had caused great harm to civilians in the Middle East and provided \"ammunition to extremists who threaten us all\".\n\nKhan had to repay £500 in expenses in 2007 in relation to a newsletter sent to constituents featuring a 'Labour rose', which was deemed to be unduly prominent. While the content of the newsletter was not deemed to be party political, the rose logo was found to be unduly prominent which may have had the effect of promoting a political party. There was no suggestion that Khan had deliberately or dishonestly compiled his expenses claims, which were not explicitly disallowed under the rules at that time. The rules were retrospectively changed disallowing the claim, which had previously been approved by the House of Commons authorities.\n\nOn 3 February 2008, \"The Sunday Times\" claimed that a conversation between Khan and prisoner Babar Ahmad – a constituent accused of involvement in terrorism – at Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes had been bugged by the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch. An inquiry was launched by the Justice Secretary, Jack Straw. There was concern that the bugging contravened the Wilson Doctrine that police should not bug MPs. The report concluded that the doctrine did not apply because it affected only bugging requiring approval by the Home Secretary, while in Khan's case the monitoring was authorised by a senior police officer. The Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, then announced a further policy review and said the bugging of discussions between MPs and their constituents should be banned.\n\nIn June 2007, Blair stood down as both Prime Minister and Labour Party leader, to be replaced by Gordon Brown. Brown thought highly of Khan, who moved up the parliamentary ranks under Brown's Premiership. Brown made Khan a party whip, who was therefore charged with ensuring that Labour-sponsored legislation successfully made it through the parliamentary process to become law. In July 2008, Khan helped push through a government proposal to permit the detention of those suspected of terror offenses for 42 days without charge. For his part in this, Khan was criticised by Liberty's Shami Chakrabarti and others, who claimed that Khan had contravened his principles on civil liberties issues.\n\nOn Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Cabinet reshuffle of 3 October 2008, Khan was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.\nIn 2008, the Fabian Society published Khan's book, \"Fairness Not Favours\". In this work, Khan argued that the Labour Party had to reconnect with British Muslims, arguing that it had lost the trust of this community as a result of the Iraq War. He also said that British Muslims had their own part to play in reconnecting with politicians, arguing that they needed to rid themselves of a victim mentality and take greater responsibility for their own community. In the House of Commons in January 2009, Khan criticised Pope Benedict XVI for the rehabilitation of Bishop Richard Williamson following his remarks about the Holocaust, a move he described as \"highly unsavoury\" and of \"great concern\".\n\nIn June 2009 he was promoted to Minister of State for Transport. In what was believed to be a first for an MP, Khan used his Twitter account to self-announce his promotion. Though Khan was not a member of the cabinet, he attended meetings for agenda items covering his policy area, thus becoming the first Muslim to sit in on the British Cabinet. As Transport Minister, Khan supported plans to expand Heathrow Airport with the addition of a third runway.\n\nDuring this period, Khan served as chairman of the socialist Fabian Society, remaining on its Executive Committee. In 2009, he won the Jenny Jeger Award (\"Best Fabian Pamphlet\") for his writing \"Fairness not Favours: How to re-connect with British Muslims\".\n\nIn March 2010, Khan publicly stated that for a second successive year he would not be taking a pay rise as an MP or Minister, declaring \"At a time when many people in Tooting and throughout the country are having to accept pay freezes I don't think it's appropriate for MPs to accept a pay rise.\"\n\nIn 2010, Khan was re-elected as the MP for Tooting despite a swing against his party of 3.6% and a halving of his previous majority. In the subsequent Labour leadership election Khan was an early backer of Ed Miliband, becoming his campaign manager. In the wake of Labour's 2010 election defeat, Acting Leader Harriet Harman appointed Khan Shadow Secretary of State for Transport. Khan orchestrated Ed Miliband's successful campaign to become Labour leader, and was appointed to the senior roles of Shadow Lord Chancellor and Shadow Justice Secretary.\n\nIn April 2010 it was revealed that Khan had repaid falsely claimed expenses on two occasions, when literature was sent to his constituents. The first incident concerned letters sent out before the 2010 General Election which were ruled to have the \"unintentional effect of promoting his return to office\", the second a £2,550 repayment for Christmas, Eid, and birthday cards for constituents, dating back to 2006. Under House of Commons rules, pre-paid envelopes and official stationery can only be used for official parliamentary business. Khan's claim for the greetings cards was initially rejected, but he presented a new invoice no longer identifying the nature of the claim, and this was accepted. Khan attributed the improper claim for the cards to \"inexperience\" and human error and apologised for breaking the expenses rules.\n\nIn early 2013, Miliband appointed Khan as the Shadow Minister for London, a position that he held in addition to his other responsibilities. In December 2013, the Fabian Society published a collection of essays edited by Khan that was titled \"Our London\". Khan was also tasked with overseeing Labour's campaign for the 2014 London local elections, in which the party advanced its control in the city, gaining hold of twenty of the thirty-two boroughs. By this point, there was much talk of Khan making a bid for the London Mayoralty in 2016, when incumbent Mayor Boris Johnson would be stepping down. His options were affected by the outcome of the 2015 general election; if Labour won, then he would be expected to become a government minister, but if they lost then he would be free to pursue the Mayoralty. In December 2015, Khan voted against the Cameron government's plans to expand the bombing of targets in the Islamic State.\n\nPolls had suggested that Labour could be the largest party in a hung parliament following the 2015 general election, but ultimately the Conservatives secured victory. In the vote, Khan was returned for a third term as MP for Tooting, defeating his Conservative rival by 2,842 votes. He was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015, but has said that he was \"no patsy\" to Corbyn and would stand up to him. He later stated that he nominated Corbyn to \"broaden the debate\" but did not then vote for him.\n\nOn 9 May 2016, Khan resigned as an MP by his appointment to the ancient office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of The Three Chiltern Hundreds, a customary practice in the UK. This triggered a by-election in Tooting to be held in June 2016.\n\nHe is regularly named among the Top 100 London politicians in the \"London Evening Standard\"s annual poll of the 1,000 most influential Londoners and is an Ambassador for Mosaic Network, an initiative set up by Prince Charles.\n\nAfter Labour's defeat at the 2015 general election, Khan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet. He then announced himself as a candidate to be the Labour nominee for the London Mayoral elections of 2016: his rivals in this were Diane Abbott, Christian Wolmar, Gareth Thomas, David Lammy, and Tessa Jowell. Jowell, who had been an MP for 23 years and had led London's successful nomination to host the 2012 Olympic Games, was widely regarded as the favourite to win by bookmakers and opinion polls. Khan soon gained the support of prominent figures in the party, including former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, who was on Labour's leftist, socialist wing, and Oona King, who was on its centrist, Blairite wing. He also received the backing of the Labour-affiliated GMB and Unite unions, and the nomination of 44 of Labour's 73 parliamentary constituent parties in London, leaving him as one of the top two contenders alongside Jowell.\n\nKhan's main rival was Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith; Khan described him as a spoiled dilettante who \"never finishes anything he starts\". A YouGov poll for LBC suggested that while Jowell would defeat Goldsmith in a Mayoral election, Khan would not.\nIn hustings, Khan placed an emphasis on his working-class origins, which would play against Jowell's wealthier upbringing, and argued for the need for change in London, thereby insinuating that Jowell would represent too much continuity with the outgoing Johnson administration. In September 2015, Khan was announced as the winning nominee. He gained 48,152 votes (58.9%) against Jowell's 35,573 (41.1%). He was the favourite candidate in all three voting categories; Labour Party members, members of affiliated trade unions and organisations, and registered supporters who had paid £3 in order to vote.\n\nKhan vowed that if elected, he would freeze public transport fares in London for four years. He claimed that this would deprive Transport for London (TfL) of £452 million, but TfL stated that it would deprive them of £1.9 billion, taking into account projected population growth over this period. Although he had previously backed Heathrow expansion, he now opposed it, instead calling for expansion at Gatwick Airport; he was likely aware that supporting the former was a vote loser in London. Aware of the severe housing shortage in London, he also spoke of clamping down on foreign property investors, and proposed the establishment of both a \"London living rent\" tenure and a not-for-profit lettings agency that could undercut commercial operators in order to ease the high cost of renting in the city. He also called for house building on land owned by TfL, insisting that at least 50% of those constructed should be \"genuinely affordable\".\n\nThe YouGov poll had revealed that 31% of Londoners stated that they would not be \"comfortable\" with a Muslim mayor. Aware that many voters were suspicious regarding the loyalties of British Muslims to the British state, Khan emphasised his commitment to liberal social values. As part of this, he declared his opposition to homophobia, and said that he would have \"zero tolerance for anti-Semitism\". He openly condemned Islamic extremism and called on the Muslim community to take a leading role in combating it, although at the same time acknowledged the Islamophobia that many British Muslims faced. He also distanced himself from Corbyn, rebuking Labour's socialist leader for his links to armed anti-Israel groups, and criticising him for not singing the national anthem at an event commemorating the Battle of Britain. Concerned that Corbyn's socialist platform was alienating many of London's businesses, Khan declared that he would be \"the most pro-business mayor ever\", and met with groups like the Federation of Small Businesses and City of London Corporation. He also ensured that his campaign was run entirely separate from Corbyn.\n\nConversely, Goldsmith's Conservative campaign—which was orchestrated by Lynton Crosby's company—emphasised connections between Khan and Corbyn. Both the Conservative campaign and several Conservative-aligned newspapers sought to tar Khan as an apologist for, or even sympathiser with, Islamic extremism. Goldsmith's campaign material referred to Khan as \"radical and divisive\", while comments on the Conservatives' Facebook campaign material often displayed anti-Muslim sentiment. Labour accused Goldsmith's campaign of using rhetoric that was a \"dog-whistle\" to Islamophobia, while the Conservatives responded that it was \"utterly predictable that Labour label their opponents as racists\", citing the fact that during the 2008 mayoral campaign, the party had also accused Johnson of employing racist rhetoric. Goldsmith claimed that his references to Khan's \"radical\" views referred to connections with Corbyn rather than to any connection with Islamic extremism, adding that Khan was playing \"the race card\".\n\nHe is London's first ethnic minority mayor. Various press sources noted that Khan's election made him the first actively affiliated Muslim to become mayor of a major Western capital. International press sources often focused on his religious identity, with many right-wing American media outlets reacting with horror at his election. The far right party Britain First issued a press statement declaring Khan a Muslim \"occupier\" engaged in entryism and threatened to target where he \"lives, works and prays\" with direct action protest.\n\nKhan was officially sworn in as Mayor in a multi-faith ceremony held in Southwark Cathedral the following day. His first act as mayor was his appearance at a Holocaust memorial ceremony in a rugby stadium in North London, although due to delays with the results of the election, he only officially took office on 9 May. In his first major interview upon being elected, he emphasised the need for Labour to do more to win-over those who did not normally vote for the party, a statement seen as a criticism of Corbyn's leadership.\n\nIn the buildup to the referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the European Union (EU), Khan was a vocal supporter of the 'Remain' camp. He agreed to attend a Britain Stronger in Europe campaign event with the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to demonstrate cross-party support for remaining within the EU, for which he was criticised by Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who claimed that sharing a platform with the Conservatives \"discredits us\". After the murder of MP Jo Cox during the campaign, Khan called for the country to \"pause and reflect\" on the manner in which the Leave and Remain camps had been approaching the debate, stating that it had been marred by a \"climate of hatred, of poison, of negativity, of cynicism\". Following the success of the 'Leave' vote, Khan insisted that all EU citizens living in London were welcome in the city and that he was grateful for the contribution that they made to it. He endorsed the Metropolitan Police's 'We Stand Together' campaign to combat the rise in racial abuse following the referendum, and later backed the 'London is Open' campaign to encourage businesses, artists, and performers to continue coming to the city despite Brexit.\nWhile fasting for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in 2016, Khan declared that he would use the period as an opportunity to help \"break down the mystique and suspicion\" surrounding Islam in Britain and help to \"get out there and build bridges\" between communities, organising iftars to be held at synagogues, churches, and mosques. He then appeared at a Trafalgar Square celebration of Eid al-Fitr, endorsing religious freedom and lambasting \"criminals who do bad things and use the name of Islam to justify what they do\". Following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Khan attended a vigil in Old Compton Street, Soho, and insisted that he \"will do everything in [his] power to ensure that LGBT Londoners feel safe in every part of our city\"; later that month he marched in the LGBT Pride London parade.\n\nIn August 2016, Khan declared his support for Owen Smith's bid to oust Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party. Although describing him as a \"principled Labour man\", Khan said that Corbyn had failed to gain popularity with the electorate and that Labour would not win a general election under Corbyn's leadership.\n\nOn transport, Khan immediately announced the introduction of a \"Hopper\" bus ticket which would allow a passenger to take two bus journeys within an hour for the price of one; it was intended to benefit those on low incomes most. In June, Khan announced that his electoral pledge to prevent transport fare rises would only apply to \"single fares\" and pay as you go fares, and not daily, monthly, weekly, or yearly railcards; he was widely criticised for this, including by the Liberal Democrat Caroline Pidgeon, who accused him of having broken his promise. In June 2016 he ordered TfL to ban any advertising on its network that was deemed to engage in body shaming and the demeaning of women. In July he urged the government to allow TfL to take control of the failing Southern rail service, and in August launched the 24-hour Underground service on Fridays and Saturdays, an idea initially proposed by Johnson two years previously.\n\nIn his first weeks as Mayor, Khan criticised foreign investors for treating homes in London as \"gold bricks for investment\", instead urging them to invest in the construction of \"affordable homes\" for Londoners through a new agency, Homes for Londoners, which would be funded by both public and private money. However, in contrast to a pre-election statement, he revealed that he no longer supported rent freezes in the city. Insisting that he would \"oppose building on the Green Belt, which is now even more important than when it was created\", Khan vetoed the construction of a football stadium and two blocks of flats on Green Belt land in Chislehurst, after the plan had already been supported by Bromley Council.\n\nKhan backed expansion of London City Airport, removing the block on this instituted by Johnson's administration; environmentalist campaigners like Siân Berry stated that this was a breach of Khan's pledge to be London's \"greenest ever\" mayor.\nOpposing expansion at Heathrow Airport, he urged Prime Minister Theresa May to instead support expansion at Gatwick Airport, stating that to do so would bring \"substantial economic benefits\" to London.\n\nKhan launched a \"No Nights Sleeping Rough\" taskforce to tackle youth homelessness in London in October 2016.\n\nKhan has called air pollution “the biggest public health emergency of a generation.” In April 2017, Khan announced plans to clean up London's air by establishing an \"ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez)\" across London that would charge owners of the most polluting cars with a fine between £3 or £12.50 per day. The zone is planned to be introduced in 2019.\n\nKhan criticised Great Britain's government in June 2017 for its lack of drive in improving general air quality. He stated that the government’s action plan on the issue lacked “serious detail, fails to tackle all emission sources, such as from buildings, construction or the river, and does not utilise the government’s full resources and powers”, reflecting its low prioritisation of the issue in the past.\n\nIn September, he announced that the first 50 air quality audits for primary schools in the worst-polluted areas of the city had been launched with the objective to reduce air pollution around public schools. The audits will continue until the end of 2017, with reports being published in 2018.\nKhan has been criticised for failing to deal with a knife crime epidemic during his term in office. In an interview with LBC, he accepted responsibility for the situation as the Police and Crime Commissioner for the city but blamed budgetary cuts by the UK Government.\n\nWriting for \"The Spectator\", the political commentator Nick Cohen described Khan as a centre-left social democrat, while the journalist Amol Rajan termed him \"a torch-bearer for the social democratic wing\" of the Labour Party. The BBC describe Khan as being located on the party's soft left. Conversely, in an article for Al Jazeera, the Marxist commentator Richard Seymour described Khan as a centrist, while Matt Wrack, the General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, characterised Khan as belonging to \"that part of the Labour Party that was in government under Blair and Brown\".\n\nThe journalist Dave Hill described Khan as a social liberal, and Khan has self-described as a \"proud feminist\".\n\nKhan received death threats from Islamic extremists after voting in favour of the same-sex marriage equality bill. He was also threatened by the far-right group Britain First, which in 2016 threatened to take \"direct action\" against Khan where he \"lives, works and prays\" as part of an anti-Muslim campaign.\n\nIn January 2013 and 2015, Khan was nominated for the Politician of the Year Award at the British Muslim Awards. He later won the award in February 2016.\nNot all British Muslims have however supported him; some of the supporters of Lutfur Rahman—whom Khan opposed—claimed that Khan was part of an Islamophobic Labour establishment.\n\nJournalist Dave Hill has said that Khan was \"savvy, streetwise and not averse to a scrap\", whilst also describing him as having a \"joshing, livewire off-stage personality\" which differed from the formal image he often projected while onstage.\nKhan used to perform stand-up comedy before running for Mayor, including a ten-minute money-raising \"Stand Up for Labour\" routine. Comedian Arthur Smith stated that Khan could become a \"good club-level comedian one day\". During the 2016 Mayoral campaign, Goldsmith referred to Khan as \"a caricature machine politician... the sort of politician who justified peoples' mistrust in politics\", as evidence citing Khan's U-turn on supporting Heathrow expansion.\nAnother rival in the 2016 Mayoral campaign, George Galloway of the Respect Party, referred to Khan as a \"flip-flop merchant\" and a \"product of the Blairite machine\".\n\nKhan is a practising Muslim, who observes the fast during Ramadan, and regularly attends Al-Muzzammil Mosque in Tooting. Writing in \"The Guardian\", the journalist Dave Hill described Khan as \"a moderate, socially liberal Muslim\". He has expressed the view that \"too often the people who are 'representing' the Islamic faith aren't representative, they're angry men with beards. And that is not what Islam is about.\"\n\nKhan married Saadiya Ahmed, a fellow solicitor, in 1994. They have two daughters, both raised in the Islamic faith.\n\n\n"}

He reportedly clashed with the Ottomans in 1918 before their withdrawal from Syria, killing two Ottoman soldiers who were harassing a wife of his father. This act gained him a local reputation as a rebel. After his father's death, he built a shrine for him and reportedly performed miracles at the site, according to local legend.\n\nIn 1918 the French occupied the Syrian coast and began to move into the interior. On December 15, 1918, Saleh al-Ali called for a meeting of prominent Alawi notables in the town of Sheikh Badr. Al-Ali alerted the attendees that the French had occupied the Syrian coast with the intention of separating the region from the rest of the country, and urged them to revolt and expel the French from Syria. When the French authorities heard of the meeting, they sent a force from Al-Qadmus to the town of Sheikh Badr in order to arrest Saleh al-Ali. Al-Ali and his men ambushed the force at the village of Niha, west of Wadi al-Oyoun. The French forces were defeated and suffered more than 35 casualties.\n\nAfter the initial victory, al-Ali started to organize his rebels into a disciplined force, with its own general command and military ranks. The army was supported by the local population, and some women supplied water and food and replaced the men at work in the fields. Al-Ali also allied himself with the rebellion of Ibrahim Hananu in Aleppo, the uprising in Talkalakh by the Dandashi tribe and the revolt in Antioch by Subhi Barakat. He also received funds and arms from Kemal Atatürk of Turkey which was also at war with France at the time.\n\nIn July 1919, in retaliation to French attacks against rebel positions, al-Ali attacked and occupied several Ismaili villages that were allied to the French. A truce was concluded between the two, but the French violated it by occupying and burning the village of Kaf al-Jaz. Al-Ali retaliated by attacking and occupying al-Qadmus from which the French conducted their military operations against him.\n\nThe balance of power began to shift in favor of the French after they conquered Damascus, defeating a makeshift army at the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920. In November, General Henri Gouraud mounted a full-fledged campaign against Saleh al-Ali's forces in the An-Nusayriyah Mountains. They entered al-Ali's village of Ash-Shaykh Badr and arrested many Alawi notables. Al-Ali fled to the north, but a large French force overran his positions and al-Ali went into hiding. A French court-martial convened in Latakia and sentenced him to death \"in absentia\".\n\nAl-Ali remained in hiding until General Gouraud issued a general amnesty in 1922. He returned to his home and abstained from all political activity until his death on 13 April 1950 in Tartus.\n\nSaleh Al-Ali became a celebrated figure after the Syria's independence. Al-Ali, in his first public appearance since 1922, was a guest of honor of president Shukri al-Quwatli at the Evacuation Day celebrations on 17 April 1946.\n"}
{"id": "29405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29405", "title": "Sikh", "text": "Sikh\n\nA Sikh (; ' ) is a person associated with Sikhism, a monotheistic religion that originated in the 15th century, in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent, based on the revelation of Guru Nanak. The term \"Sikh\" has its origin in the Sanskrit words शिष्य ('), meaning a disciple, or a student. A Sikh, according to Article I of the \"Sikh Rehat Maryada\" (the Sikh code of conduct), is \"any human being who faithfully believes in One Immortal Being; ten Gurus, from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh; Guru Granth Sahib; the teachings of the ten Gurus and the baptism bequeathed by the tenth Guru\".\n\nThe Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent has been the historic homeland of the Sikhs, and was ruled by the Sikhs for significant parts of the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the Punjab state in northwest India has a majority Sikh population, and sizeable communities of Sikhs exist around the world. Many countries, such as the United Kingdom, recognize Sikhs as a designated religion on their censuses. The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has sought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as a ethnicity, arguing that Sikhs \"self-identify as an 'ethnic minority and believe \"that they are more than just a religion\".\n\nMale Sikhs generally have \"Singh\" (Lion) as their middle or last name (not all Singhs are Sikhs), and female Sikhs have \"Kaur\" (Princess) as their middle or last name. Sikhs who have undergone the \"Khanḍe-kī-Pahul\" (the Sikh initiation ceremony) may also be recognized by the five Ks: Kesh, uncut hair which is kept covered, usually by a turban; \"Kara\", an iron or steel bracelet; \"Kirpan\", a sword tucked into a \"gatra\" strap or a \"kamal kasar\" belt; \"Kachehra\", a cotton undergarment; and \"Kanga\", a small wooden comb. Initiated male and female Sikhs must cover their hair with a turban.\n\nGuru Nanak (1469–1539), founder of Sikhism, was born to Mehta Kalu and Mata Tripta, in the village of Talwandi, now called Nankana Sahib, near Lahore. Guru Nanak was a religious leader and social reformer. However, Sikh political history may be said to begin with the death of the fifth Sikh guru, Guru Arjan Dev, in 1606. Religious practices were formalised by Guru Gobind Singh on 30 March 1699. Gobind Singh initiated five people from a variety of social backgrounds, known as the \"Panj Piare\" (the five beloved ones) to form the Khalsa, or collective body of initiated Sikhs. During the period of Mughal rule in India (1556–1707) several Sikh gurus were killed by the Mughals for opposing their persecution of minority religious communities including Sikhs. Sikhs subsequently militarized to oppose Mughal rule.\n\nAfter defeating the Afghan and Mughal, sovereign states called Misls were formed, under Jassa Singh Ahluwalia. The Confederacy was unified and transformed into the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh Bahadur, which was characterised by religious tolerance and pluralism, with Christians, Muslims and Hindus in positions of power. The empire is considered the zenith of political Sikhism, encompassing Kashmir, Ladakh and Peshawar. Hari Singh Nalwa, the commander-in-chief of the Sikh Khalsa Army in the North West Frontier, expanded the confederacy to the Khyber Pass. Its secular administration implemented military, economic and governmental reforms.After the annexation of the Sikh kingdom by the British, the latter recognized the martial qualities of the Sikhs and Punjabis in general and started recruiting from that area. During the 1857 Indian mutiny, the Sikhs stayed loyal to the British. This resulted in heavy recruiting from Punjab to the colonial army for the next 90 years of the British Raj. The distinct turban that differentiates a Sikh from other turban wearers is a relic of the rules of the British Indian Army. The British colonial rule saw the emergence of many reform movements in India including Punjab. This included formation in 1873 and 1879 of the First and Second Singh Sabha respectively. The Sikh leaders of the Singh Sabha worked to offer a clear definition of Sikh identity and tried to purify Sikh belief and practice.\n\nThe later part of British colonial rule saw the emergence of the Akali movement to bring reform in the gurdwaras during the early 1920s. The movement led to the introduction of Sikh Gurdwara Bill in 1925, which placed all the historical Sikh shrines in India under the control of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).\n\nThe months leading up to the partition of India in 1947 were marked by conflict in the Punjab between Sikhs and Muslims. This caused the religious migration of Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus from West Punjab, mirroring a similar religious migration of Punjabi Muslims from East Punjab.\nThe 1960s saw growing animosity between Sikhs and Hindus in India, with the Sikhs demanding the creation of a Punjab state on a linguistic basis similar to other states in India. This was promised to Sikh leader Master Tara Singh by Jawaharlal Nehru, in return for Sikh political support during negotiations for Indian independence. Although the Sikhs obtained the Punjab, they lost Hindi-speaking areas to Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. Chandigarh was made a union territory and the capital of Haryana and Punjab on 1 November 1966.\n\nSikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale triggered violence in the Punjab. The prime minister Indira Gandhi ordered an operation to remove Bhindranwale from the Golden Temple in Operation Blue Star.This led to her assassination by her Sikh bodyguards. Gandhi's assassination resulted in an explosion of violence against Sikh communities and the killing of thousands of Sikhs throughout India. Since 1984, relations between Sikhs and Hindus have moved toward a rapprochement aided by economic prosperity. However, a 2002 claim by the Hindu right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) that \"Sikhs are Hindus\" disturbed Sikh sensibilities.\n\nDuring the 1999 Vaisakhi, Sikhs worldwide celebrated the 300th anniversary of the creation of the Khalsa. Canada Post honoured Sikh Canadians with a commemorative stamp in conjunction with the 300th anniversary of Vaisakhi. On April 9, 1999, Indian president K.R. Narayanan issued a stamp commemorating the 300th anniversary of the Khalsa.\n\nFrom the Guru Granth Sahib,\n\nThe five Ks (\"panj kakaar\") are five articles of faith which all baptized Sikhs (Amritdhari Sikhs) are obliged to wear. The symbols represent the ideals of Sikhism: honesty, equality, fidelity, meditating on Waheguru and never bowing to tyranny.\nThe five symbols are:\n\nThe Sikhs have a number of musical instruments: the rebab, dilruba, taus, jori and sarinda. Playing the sarangi was encouraged by Guru Hargobind. The rebab was played by Bhai Mardana as he accompanied Guru Nanak on his journeys. The jori and sarinda were introduced to Sikh devotional music by Guru Arjan. The taus was designed by Guru Hargobind, who supposedly heard a peacock singing and wanted to create an instrument mimicking its sounds (\"taus\" is the Persian word for peacock). The dilruba was designed by Guru Gobind Singh at the request of his followers, who wanted a smaller instrument than the taus. After Japji Sahib, all of the shabad in the Guru Granth Sahib were composed as raags. This type of singing is known as Gurmat Sangeet.\n\nWhen they marched into battle, the Sikhs would play a \"Ranjit Nagara\" (victory drum) to boost morale. Nagaras (usually two to three feet in diameter, although some were up to five feet in diameter) are played with two sticks. The beat of the large drums, and the raising of the Nishan Sahib, meant that the \"singhs\" were on their way.\n\nNumbering about 27 million worldwide, Sikhs make up 0.39 percent of the world population; approximately 83 percent live in India. About 76 percent of all Sikhs live in the north Indian State of Punjab, where they form a majority (about two-thirds) of the population. Substantial communities of Sikhs live in the Indian states or union territories of Chandigarh where they form 13.11% of the population, Haryana (more than 1.2 million), Rajasthan, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nSikh migration from British India began in earnest during the second half of the 19th century, when the British completed their annexation of the Punjab. The British Raj recruited Sikhs for the Indian Civil Service (particularly the British Indian Army), which led to Sikh migration throughout India and the British Empire. During the Raj, semiskilled Sikh artisans were transported from the Punjab to British East Africa to help build railroads. Sikhs emigrated from India after World War II, most going to the United Kingdom but many to North America. Some Sikhs who had settled in eastern Africa were expelled by Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in 1972. Economics is a major factor in Sikh migration, and significant communities exist in the United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, East Africa, Australia, Singapore and Thailand. Due to this, Canada is the country that has the highest number of Sikhs in proportion to the population in the world at 1.4% of Canada's total population.\n\nAlthough the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high, traditional patterns of Sikh migration favouring English-speaking countries (particularly the United Kingdom) have changed during the past decade due to stricter immigration laws. Moliner (2006) wrote that as a consequence of Sikh migration to the UK \"becom[ing] virtually impossible since the late 1970s\", migration patterns evolved to continental Europe. Italy is a rapidly growing destination for Sikh migration, with Reggio Emilia and Vicenza having significant Sikh population clusters. Italian Sikhs are generally involved in agriculture, agricultural processing, the manufacture of machine tools and horticulture.\n\nJohnson and Barrett (2004) estimate that the global Sikh population increases annually by 392,633 (1.7 percent per year, based on 2004 figures); this percentage includes births, deaths and conversions. Primarily for socio-economic reasons, Indian Sikhs have the lowest adjusted growth rate of any major religious group in India, at 16.9 percent per decade (estimated from 1991 to 2001). The Sikh population has the lowest gender balance in India, with only 903 women per 1,000 men according to the 2011 Indian census.\n\nGuru Nanak in Sri Granth Sahib calls for treating everyone equally. Other Sikh Gurus also denounced the hierarchy of the caste system. However they all came from just one caste, the Khatris. Despite that social stratification exists in the Sikh community.\n\nOver 60% of Sikhs belong to the Jat caste which is an agrarian caste.Despite being very small in numbers, the mercantile Khatri and Arora castes wield considerable influence within the Sikh community. Other common Sikh castes include Sainis(kshatriyas), Rajputs, Ramgarhias (artisans), Ahluwalias (formerly brewers), Kambojs (rural caste), Rai Sikh (rural caste), Labanas (merchants), Kumhars and the two Dalit castes, known in Sikh terminology as the Mazhabis (the Chuhras) and the Ravidasias (the Chamars).\n\nAccording to Surinder Singh Jodhka, the Sikh religion does not advocate discrimination against any caste or creed, however, in practice, Sikhs belonging to the landowning dominant castes have not shed all their prejudices against the Dalit castes. While Dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar (Communal meal). Therefore, wherever they could mobilise resources, the Sikh Dalits of Punjab have tried to construct their own gurdwara and other local level institutions in order to attain a certain degree of cultural autonomy. In 1953, Sikh leader, Master Tara Singh, succeeded in persuading the Indian Government to include Sikh castes of the converted untouchables in the list of scheduled castes. In the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, 20 of the 140 seats are reserved for low-caste Sikhs.,\n\nAccording to a 1994 estimate, Punjabis (Sikhs and non-Sikhs) comprised 10 to 15 percent of all ranks in the Indian Army, although the state contained less than 3% of the country's population. The Indian government does not release religious or ethnic origins of the military personnel, but a 1991 report by Tim McGirk estimated that 20 percent of Indian Army officers were Sikhs. Together with the Gurkhas recruited from Nepal, the Maratha Light Infantry from Maharashtra and the Jat Regiment, the Sikhs are one of the few communities to have exclusive regiments in the Indian Army. The Sikh Regiment is one of the most-decorated regiments in the army, with 73 Battle Honours, 14 Victoria Crosses, 21 first-class Indian Orders of Merit (equivalent to the Victoria Cross), 15 Theatre Honours, five COAS Unit Citations, two Param Vir Chakras, 14 Maha Vir Chakras, five Kirti Chakras, 67 Vir Chakras and 1,596 other awards. The highest-ranking general in the history of the Indian Air Force is a Punjabi Sikh, Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh. Plans by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence for a Sikh infantry regiment were scrapped in June 2007.\n\nHistorically, most Indians have been farmers and 66 percent of the Indian population are engaged in agriculture. Indian Sikhs are employed in agriculture to a lesser extent; India's 2001 census found 39 percent of the working population of the Punjab employed in this sector. The success of the 1960s Green Revolution, in which India went from \"famine to plenty, from humiliation to dignity\", was based in the Punjab (which became known as \"the breadbasket of India\"). The Punjab is the wealthiest Indian state per capita, with the average Punjabi income three times the national average. The Green Revolution centred on Indian farmers adopting more intensive and mechanised agricultural methods, aided by the electrification of the Punjab, cooperative credit, consolidation of small holdings and the existing, British Raj-developed canal system. According to Swedish political scientist Ishtiaq Ahmad, a factor in the success of the Indian green revolution was the \"Sikh cultivator, often the Jat, whose courage, perseverance, spirit of enterprise and muscle prowess proved crucial\". However, not all aspects of the green revolution were beneficial. Indian physicist Vandana Shiva wrote that the green revolution made the \"negative and destructive impacts of science [i.e. the green revolution] on nature and society\" invisible, and was a catalyst for Punjabi Sikh and Hindu tensions despite a growth in material wealth.\nPunjabi Sikhs are engaged in a number of professions which include science, engineering and medicine. Notable examples are nuclear scientist Piara Singh Gill (who worked on the Manhattan Project), fibre-optics pioneer Narinder Singh Kapany and physicist, science writer and broadcaster Simon Singh.\n\nIn business, the UK-based clothing retailers New Look and the Thai-based Jaspal were founded by Sikhs. India's largest pharmaceutical company, Ranbaxy Laboratories, is headed by Sikhs. UK Sikhs have the highest percentage of home ownership (82 percent) of any religious community. UK Sikhs are the second-wealthiest (after the Jewish community) religious group in the UK, with a median total household wealth of £229,000.\nIn Singapore Kartar Singh Thakral expanded his family's trading business, Thakral Holdings, into total assets of almost $1.4 billion and is Singapore's 25th-richest person. Sikh Bob Singh Dhillon is the first Indo-Canadian billionaire. The Sikh diaspora has been most successful in North America.\nSikh intellectuals, sportsmen and artists include poet and Bollywood lyricist Rajkavi Inderjeet Singh Tulsi, writer Khushwant Singh, England cricketer Monty Panesar, former 400m runner Milkha Singh, Indian wrestler and actor Dara Singh, former Indian hockey team captains Ajitpal Singh and Balbir Singh Sr., former Indian cricket captain Bishen Singh Bedi, Harbhajan Singh (India's most successful off spin cricket bowler), Navjot Singh Sidhu (former Indian cricketer turned politician). Bollywood actresses include Neetu Singh, Simran Judge, Poonam Dhillon, Mahi Gill, Esha Deol, Parminder Nagra, Gul Panag, Mona Singh, Namrata Singh Gujral and director Gurinder Chadha, Parminder Gill .\n\nSikhs have migrated worldwide, with a variety of occupations. The Sikh Gurus preached ethnic and social harmony, and Sikhs comprise a number of ethnic groups. Those with over 1,000 members include the Ahluwalia, Arain, Arora, Bhatra, Bairagi, Bania, Basith, Bawaria, Bazigar, Bhabra, Chamar, Chhimba, Darzi, Dhobi, Gujar, Jatt, Jhinwar, Kahar, Kalal, Kamboj, Khatri, Kumhar, Labana, Lohar, Mahtam, Mazhabi, Megh, Mirasi, Mochi, Mohyal, Nai, Rajput, Ramgarhia, Saini, Sansi, Sudh, Tarkhan, Kashyap Rajput .\n\nAn order of Punjabi Sikhs, the Nihang or the Akalis, was formed during Ranjit Singh's time. Under their leader, Akali Phula Singh, they won many battles for the Sikh Confederacy during the early 19th century.\n\nSikhs supported the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. By the beginning of World War I, Sikhs in the British Indian Army totaled over 100,000 (20 percent of the force). Until 1945 fourteen Victoria Crosses were awarded to Sikhs, a per-capita regimental record. In 2002 the names of all Sikh VC and George Cross recipients were inscribed on the monument of the Memorial Gates on Constitution Hill, next to Buckingham Palace. Chanan Singh Dhillon was instrumental in campaigning for the memorial.\nDuring World War I, Sikh battalions fought in Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Gallipoli and France. Six battalions of the Sikh Regiment were raised during World War II, serving in the Second Battle of El Alamein, the Burma and Italian campaigns and in Iraq and receiving 27 battle honours. Around the world, Sikhs are commemorated in Commonwealth cemeteries.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Sikhs began to emigrate to East Africa, the Far East, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1907 the Khalsa Diwan Society was established in Vancouver, and four years later the first gurdwara was established in London. In 1912 the first gurdwara in the United States was founded in Stockton, California.\n\nSince Sikhs (like many Middle Eastern men) wear turbans and keep beards, some people in Western countries have mistaken Sikh men for Muslim or Arabic and Afghan men since the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War. Several days after the 9/11 attacks Sikh Balbir Singh Sodhi was murdered by Frank Roque, who thought Sodhi was connected with al-Qaeda. CNN suggested an increase in hate crimes against Sikh men in the United States and the UK after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nSince Sikhism has never actively sought converts, the Sikhs have remained a relatively homogeneous ethnic group. The 3HO organisation claim to have inspired a moderate growth in non-Indian adherents of Sikhism. In 1998 an estimated 7,800 3HO Sikhs, known colloquially as ‘gora’ (ਗੋਰਾ) or ‘white’ Sikhs, were mainly centred around Española, New Mexico and Los Angeles, California. Sikhs and the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund overturned a 1925 Oregon law banning the wearing of turbans by teachers and government officials.\n\nIn an attempt to foster Sikh leaders in the Western world, youth initiatives by a number of organisations exist. The Sikh Youth Alliance of North America sponsors an annual Sikh Youth Symposium, a public-speaking and debate competition held in gurdwaras throughout the U.S. and Canada. There are a number of Sikh office holders in Canada. In the United States, the current U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and former governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley, was born and raised as a Sikh, but converted to Christianity after her marriage. She still actively attends both Sikh and Christian services.\n\nThe Khalistan movement is a Sikh separatist movement, which seeks to create a separate country called Khalistān (\"The Land of the Pure\") in the Punjab region of South Asia to serve as a homeland for Sikhs. The territorial definition of the proposed country Khalistan consists of both the Punjab, India along with Punjab, Pakistan and includes parts of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Rajasthan.\n\nKhalistan movement began as an expatriate venture. In 1971, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in an advertisement published in the \"New York Times\" by an expat Jagjit Singh Chohan. By proclaiming the formation of Khalistan he was able to collect millions of dollars from the Sikh diaspora.On 12 April 1980 he declared the formation of \"National Council of Khalistan\", at Anandpur Sahib. He declared himself as the President of the Council and Balbir Singh Sandhu as its Secretary General. In May 1980, Jagjit Singh Chauhan travelled to London and announced the formation of Khalistan. A similar announcement was made by Balbir Singh Sandhu, in Amritsar, who released stamps and currency of Khalistan. The inaction of the authorities in Amritsar and elsewhere was decried by Akali Dal headed by the Sikh leader Harchand Singh Longowal as a political stunt by the Congress(I) party of Indira Gandhi.\nWith financial and political support of the Sikh diaspora the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab, which has a Sikh-majority population and reached its zenith in the late 1970s and 1980s when the secessionist movement caused large scale violence among the local population. \nOperation Blue Star was an Indian military operation carried out between 1 and 8 June 1984, ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to remove militant religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib complex in Amritsar, Punjab. In July 1983, the Sikh political party Akali Dal's President Harchand Singh Longowal had invited Bhindranwale to take up residence in Golden Temple Complex to evade arrest. Bhindranwale later on made the sacred temple complex an armoury and headquarters. In the violent events leading up to the Operation Blue Star since the inception of Akali Dharm Yudh Morcha, the militants had killed 165 Hindus and Nirankaris, even 39 Sikhs opposed to Bhindranwale were killed. The total number of deaths was 410 in violent incidents and riots while 1,180 people were injured. Casualty figures for the Army were 83 dead and 249 injured. According to the official estimate presented by the Indian government, 1592 were apprehended and there were 493 combined militant and civilian casualties. High civilian casualties were attributed to militants using pilgrims trapped inside the temple as human shields.\n\nAssassination of PM Indira Gandhi and bombing of Air India plane killing 328 passengers happened in that period. Various pro-Khalistan outfits have been involved in a separatist movement against the Government of India ever since. There are claims of funding from Sikhs outside India to attract young people into these pro-Khalistan militant groups.\n\nIn January 1986, the Golden Temple was occupied by militants belonging to All India Sikh Students Federation and Damdami Taksal. On 26 January 1986, a gathering known as the Sarbat Khalsa (a de-facto parliament) passed a resolution (\"gurmattā\") favouring the creation of Khalistan. Subsequently, a number of rebel militant groups in favour of Khalistan waged a major insurgency against the government of India. Indian security forces suppressed the insurgency in the early 1990s, but Sikh political groups such as the Khalsa Raj Party and SAD (A) continued to pursue an independent Khalistan through non-violent means. Pro-Khalistan organisations such as Dal Khalsa (International) are also active outside India, supported by a section of the Sikh diaspora.\n\nIn the 1990s the insurgency petered out, and the movement failed to reach its objective due to multiple reasons including a heavy police crackdown on separatists, divisions among the Sikhs and loss of support from the Sikh population.\n\nSikh art and culture are nearly synonymous with that of the Punjab, and Sikhs are easily recognised by their distinctive turban (Dastar). The Punjab has been called India's melting pot, due to the confluence of invading cultures from the rivers from which the region gets its name. Sikh culture is therefore a synthesis of cultures. Sikhism has forged a unique architecture, which S. S. Bhatti described as \"inspired by Guru Nanak's creative mysticism\" and \"is a mute harbinger of holistic humanism based on pragmatic spirituality\".\n\nDuring the Mughal and Afghan persecution of the Sikhs during the 17th and 18th centuries, the latter were concerned with preserving their religion and gave little thought to art and culture. With the rise of Ranjit Singh and the Sikh Raj in Lahore and Delhi, there was a change in the landscape of art and culture in the Punjab; Hindus and Sikhs could build decorated shrines without the fear of destruction or looting.\n\nThe Sikh Confederacy was the catalyst for a uniquely Sikh form of expression, with Ranjit Singh commissioning forts, palaces, bungas (residential places) and colleges in a Sikh style. Sikh architecture is characterised by gilded fluted domes, cupolas, kiosks, stone lanterns, ornate balusters and square roofs. A pinnacle of Sikh style is Harmandir Sahib (also known as the Golden Temple) in Amritsar.\n\nSikh culture is influenced by militaristic motifs (with the Khanda the most obvious), and most Sikh artifacts—except for the relics of the Gurus—have a military theme. This theme is evident in the Sikh festivals of Hola Mohalla and Vaisakhi, which feature marching and displays of valor.\n\nAlthough the art and culture of the Sikh diaspora have merged with that of other Indo-immigrant groups into categories like \"British Asian\", \"Indo-Canadian\" and \"Desi-Culture\", a minor cultural phenomenon which can be described as \"political Sikh\" has arisen. The art of diaspora Sikhs like Amarjeet Kaur Nandhra and Amrit and Rabindra Kaur Singh (the \"Singh Twins\") is influenced by their Sikhism and current affairs in the Punjab.\n\nBhangra and Giddha are two forms of Punjabi folk dancing which have been adapted and pioneered by Sikhs. Punjabi Sikhs have championed these forms of expression worldwide, resulting in Sikh culture becoming linked to Bhangra (although \"Bhangra is not a Sikh institution but a Punjabi one\").\n\nSikh painting is a direct offshoot of the Kangra school of painting. In 1810, Ranjeet Singh (1780–1839) occupied Kangra Fort and appointed Sardar Desa Singh Majithia his governor of the Punjab hills. In 1813 the Sikh army occupied Guler State, and Raja Bhup Singh became a vassal of the Sikhs. With the Sikh kingdom of Lahore becoming the paramount power, some of the Pahari painters from Guler migrated to Lahore for the patronage of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh and his Sardars.\n\nThe Sikh school adapted Kangra painting to Sikh needs and ideals. Its main subjects are the ten Sikh gurus and stories from Guru Nanak's Janamsakhis. The tenth Guru, Gobind Singh, left a deep impression on the followers of the new faith because of his courage and sacrifices. Hunting scenes and portraits are also common in Sikh painting.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47439088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47439088", "title": "Steve Moxon (whistleblower)", "text": "Steve Moxon (whistleblower)\n\nSteve Moxon is a British former civil servant who first came to prominence as a whistleblower in March 2004 while he was employed as a caseworker at the Home Office, which is the ministerial department of the United Kingdom that handles immigration, security, and law and order. Since being dismissed from his job at the Home Office and accepting an out-of-court settlement to an employment tribunal case he brought against his former employer, he has worked as an independent researcher on the relationship between the sexes. He was selected as a UK Independence Party (UKIP) candidate for the 2012 local elections in Sheffield, but was forced to stand as an independent candidate after UKIP deselected him following comments that he made on his blog about the Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik. Moxon has written two books: one on immigration and the other on the science of the relationship between the sexes. The former attracted praise from some critics, but was criticised by others as \"highly selective\" and Islamophobic. The latter has been described as \"singularly odd\" and \"wilfully controversial\".\n\nMoxon came to public prominence as a whistleblower in March 2004, while working at the Home Office. Moxon was a caseworker in the Home Office's Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Sheffield. He claimed that immigration checks had been waived for people from the eight countries in central and eastern Europe that were due to join the European Union in May of that year, so as to make migration flows following EU enlargement look less dramatic. The allegations were published in the \"Sunday Times\". Moxon's revelations, along with those of two other whistleblowers, resulted in the resignation of junior minister Beverley Hughes. Moxon himself was dismissed from his civil service job. Initially, he was feted by figures from the opposition Conservative Party including Michael Howard and David Davis, but they distanced themselves from him when it was revealed that Moxon had e-mailed the website of the BBC's \"Panorama\" programme claiming that: \"An international alliance of Islamic Year Zeros feverishly exporting death to 'infidel' and non-fundamentalist Muslims alike...eventually will have to be silenced by nuclear weapons\".\n\nMoxon subsequently wrote a book, \"The Great Immigration Scandal\", which was published by Imprint Academic in August 2004. David Davis had been scheduled to chair the launch event for the book, but withdrew \"amid claims that the book was an Islamophobic rant\". A Conservative Party spokesman reported that Davis \"had agreed to go provisionally and talk in favour of Steve as a whistleblower. But that was before he saw the contents of the book. He then felt unable to attend\". According to \"The Guardian\", the book \"claims the term 'paki' is not racist; predicts immigration leading to Ulster-style civil war; and Asians are more likely to be organised criminals\". Labour MP Frank Field reviewed the book for the \"Sunday Times\", describing it as a \"slow-burn Molotov cocktail on immigration\". It received positive endorsements from commentators including Andrew Green of MigrationWatch UK and David G. Green of Civitas. Academic Neil Lunt, reviewing the book in the journal \"Political Studies Review\", gave it one star and wrote that: \"Scandals are everywhere and doomsday scenarios litter the text. There is a lack of clear and judicious argument: referencing is highly selective, and there are frequent sweeping and unsupported statements. Moxon fails to convey an understanding of many issues including structural discrimination, the 1951 Refugee Convention and Britain's relationship to Empire. In some places the text is well written; in others it resembles a teenager's diary. Further, alongside the now familiar caricatures of migrant scroungers, there were also inappropriate and offensive references \"vis-à-vis\" women, disability and race\".\n\nFollowing his sacking, Moxon announced that he would take the Home Office to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal. In July 2005, on the day the tribunal was scheduled for, Moxon and the Home Office reached an out-of-court settlement. Moxon reportedly accepted a settlement of between £40,000 and £50,000, and signed a gagging clause.\n\nIn a study of media coverage of whistleblowing, academics Karin Wahl-Jorgensen and Joanne Hunt use Moxon's case as an example of how, in a sample covering the period 1 January 1997 to 20 March 2009, \"whistleblower stories featured prominently in tabloids when they chimed with the political orientation of that particular newspaper\". They note \"the right-leaning, anti-immigration \"Express\"' coverage\" of his whistleblowing. They also note that the \"Express\" compared the whistleblowing of Moxon with that of Clare Short and Katherine Gunn. The newspaper described Moxon as \"brave\" and suggested that he \"said what he did to protect his country\", and Gunn as \"acting on principle\", while it claimed Short's revelations about the British government's illegal surveillance at the United Nations \"hurt her country\".\n\nIn 2012, Moxon was due to stand as a UK Independence Party candidate in local elections in Sheffield, but he was deselected by the party after endorsing the analysis contained in the \"manifesto\" of Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik. Moxon had written on his blog that: \"That pretty well everyone—myself not excluded—recoiled at his actions, does not belie the accuracy of Breivik's research and analysis in his 'manifesto', which is in line with most scholarship in respect of both Political Correctness and Islam\". Moxon and UKIP both noted that he had not said that he condoned Breivik's crimes, but the party noted that \"he has made a number of remarks on subjects such as the Breivik manifesto and Islam that are at odds with UKIP policy and perspective\". He eventually stood as an independent candidate, winning 363 votes in the Dore and Totley ward.\n\nAccording to Moxon's personal website, his politics were originally \"centre-Left/'green'\". He states that he was \"a Liberal-Democrat activist for the best part of two decades\". According to a 2004 article in the \"Sheffield Star\", Moxon also \"claims to have played a part in the backroom team for the election campaign of Hallam MP Richard Allan\".\n\nIn an interview with the \"Evening Standard\" published in 2007, Moxon stated that he didn't \"have a particular interest\" in debates about immigration, noting that his passion was instead for psychology, and that he had previously dropped out of a psychology degree course. Moxon now describes himself as an independent researcher. He stated in 2007 that the payout he received from the Home Office as a result of their out-of-court settlement enabled him \"to not have to work for a while, so that's when I started writing\". In 2008, his second book, \"The Woman Racket: The New Science Explaining How the Sexes Relate at Work, at Play and in Society\", was published by Imprint Academic. According to Andy McSmith of \"The Independent\", the book expounds Moxon's \"thesis that men are the disadvantaged sex\". In a review, philosopher George Williamson wrote that it was \"a singularly odd book\". He argued that, despite the book's subtitle, \"the science presented isn't all that new, nor is much science presented\" and that \"there are myriad concerns with the details of the science <nowiki>[Moxon]</nowiki> invokes\". Novelist Lionel Shriver wrote in the \"Guardian\" that it was a \"wilfully controversial book claiming that men are the downtrodden sex, so pretentious and badly written that even the happy prospect of finding it offensive couldn't pull me through\".\n\nIn 2012, Moxon was ranked by an anti-feminist website as one of the ten most powerful people in the men's rights movement. He has also given evidence to a House of Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee inquiry into women in the workplace. It was reported that Moxon had suggested to the committee that women were \"incapable\" of rising to senior management positions. Feminist writer Laura Bates argued that it was worrying that the select committee \"should be seeking out the view of someone who has openly expressed these opinions and demonstrated that he is prejudiced against women as a gender\". Committee member Robin Walker noted that Moxon was chosen to ensure \"a wide range of views\" was represented, but that \"He was definitely on the extreme end and he didn't come across as very reasonable at all\".\n\nMoxon made a complaint to the BBC Trust about coverage of the select committee's inquiry in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme \"Woman's Hour\", broadcast in December 2012. He complained that he had not in fact claimed that women were incapable of becoming bosses. Moxon's claim that the programme \"had over many years displayed unfairness to men generically and had dismissed scientific research on men/women\" was dismissed, as were three of Moxon's other complaints, including that about the characterisation of his evidence to the inquiry. His complaint that the presenter misreprestented him as \"a man who describes himself as an academic\" was, however, upheld. In his complaint, Moxon stated that he describes himself as an \"independent cross-disciplinary researcher/writer on the biological roots of human sociality with a particular interest in the sexes\", and noted that he did not have a university affiliation.\n"}
