In 2011, Ahlam joined MBC's \"Arab Idol\" judging panel, and retained as judge for four consecutive seasons.\n\nAhlam bint Ali bin Hazeem Alshamsi was born in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates to an Emirati father and a Bahraini mother. Her father is an Emirati folk singer, Ali Alshamsi. Ahlam was raised as a child in Bahrain. She is married to the famous Qatari rally champion, Mubarak Al-Hajiri, with whom she has three children. She is one of the Arab Stars in the Middle East. Mohammed Abdo, a prominent and well-known musician within the Arab world, gave her the nickname: Star of the UAE. however, Ahlam was crowned queen at the Festival in Doha 2003 Qatar.\n\nShe participated in many festivals around the Arab region and western region , particularly the \"Layali Dubai\" festival.

Let them prove they love their country and pick up the rubbish from their streets\" which majority of people considered to be a disrespectful generalization to the people of Lebanon. Nidal launched a hashtag on Twitter which became a popular trend easily in Lebanon and other Arab countries \"\" (Ban Ahlam from entering Lebanon).\n\nAfter that, Ahlam reportedly took other news channels to explain the situation that she referred only to few people which she doesn't consider journalists or media and that she wouldn't even insult the sand of Lebanon, let alone insulting Lebanon as a whole, she never apologized because according to her she never made a mistake.\n\nWhether directly or indirectly, she was reportedly replaced as judge with Samira Said for Arab Idol Season 4.\n\n\nShe was rewarded by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the United Arab Emirates by his Highness Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed at the \"Lamst Wafa\" honouring Event.

Deshong (September 30, 1837 - April 19, 1913) was an American industrialist, philanthropist and art collector in Chester, Pennsylvania. Deshong came from a wealthy family including his grandfather Peter Deshong and father John O. Deshong. He operated a successful quarry business for years, was a director in the Delaware County National Bank and invested his fortune in the collection of art.\n\nDeshong donated liberally to support the Chester Hospital and upon his death, donated his trust and land to the city of Chester which resulted in the creation of the Deshong Art Museum and Deshong Park. Over time, the museum fell into disrepair, suffered theft and eventually closed. The art museum is now vacant and the art collection resides with Widener University.\n\nAlfred Odenheimer Deshong was born in Chester, Pennsylvania to John O. Deshong and Emmeline L. (Terrill) Deshong and educated in the local schools. He attended Bolmar Academy in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1862, Deshong enlisted as a private in Company K, Tenth Regiment of the Pennsylvania Militia and served in the Battle of Antietam under Captain Thatcher. He was honorably discharged on September 27, 1862.\n\nIn 1863, Deshong re-enlisted when Robert E. Lee invaded Pennsyvlvania. He enlisted in company A of the 37th Regiment, Emergency Corps, known as the \"Slipher Phalanx\". He served in the Battle of Gettysburg and was honorably discharged on August 4, 1863.\n\nIn 1865, he entered into partnership with his brother, John O. Deshong, Jr., and operated the Deshong quarries in Ridley Township, Pennsylvania. The partnership was successful and lasted for 30 years until John's death on November 1, 1895.\n\nIn 1895, Deshong was elected a director of the Delaware County National Bank.\n\nDeshong donated liberally to support Chester Hospital, located at 9th and Barclay Streets in Chester. The Alfred O. Deshong sanitary cottage for the treatment of tuberculosis was built by Deshong and donated to the Chester Hospital. After his death, he left in trust his art collection, mansion and 27 acre estate to the city of Chester as an art gallery and for educational purposes. The bequest resulted in the establishment of the Deshong Memorial Park and the building of an art gallery.\n\nThe Deshong mansion was built in 1850 on 22 acres off Edgemont Avenue in the Greek Revival Italianate style by Alfred's father, John O. Deshong, Sr. It was willed to the people of Chester after Alfred's death. The land was turned into a public park named Deshong Park and an art museum was built on the property. The mansion and art museum fell into disrepair in the 1980s. The trust was dissolved and the property was taken over by the Delaware County Industrial Development Authority. The mansion suffered a partial collapse in 2013 and was demolished in 2014.\n\nThe Deshong Art Museum was built in 1914 after his death on the same property as the Deshong Mansion. The building was designed to be fireproof with exterior walls of Dover marble. The large main gallery for paintings was modeled after the Emperor of Germany's famous gallery at Cassel. It housed over 300 pieces of art including carved Japanese ivory figures, Chinese carved hard stone vessels and 19th century American and European paintings including American Impressionists Edward Redfield, Robert Spencer and George L. Noyes\n\nOther select works from the collection include:\n\nDeshong's last art purchase was a pair of large Foo dogs cast in bronze. The statues were placed flanking the doors of the Deshong mansion.\n\nAt one time it was the only public art gallery on the East Coast. From 1961 to 1978 the building was operated as a library, but over the years the museum fell into disrepair.\n\nIn July 1977 the museum was looted and several pieces of art were stolen. The heist was carried out by 15 year old Laurence McCall from Chester, Pennsylvania who would skip school and frequent the museum. The museum had limited security and McCall was able to steal paintings valued at the time at $450,000 by simply taking them off the wall and sliding them out of the museum's windows. Many of the stolen items were sold through Sotheby's and other art auction houses in New York City. McCall was eventually caught when he was 19. The authorities were not able to prove that he stole the artwork, but he was convicted for failure to pay taxes, sentenced to fifteen years in prison and served three. A majority of the artwork was recovered.\n\nIn 1979, Widener University leased the building and restored the museum. In July 1984 the remaining trustees that managed the art museum dissolved the trust. The Asian and impressionistic art collection and $500,000 of the trust were given to Widener University where the collection is currently displayed.\n\nDeshong was known as a lavish host, entertaining artists, musicians and political figures at the Deshong mansion. He never married and became reclusive toward the end of his life.\nDeshong is interred at Chester Rural Cemetery. His grave is marked by the bronze sculpture, \"Sorrow\" by Samuel Murray.\n\n"}

First names in East-Slavic languages mostly originate from three sources: Orthodox church tradition (which is itself of Greek origin), Catholic church tradition (which is itself of Latin origin) and native pre-Christian Slavic origin lexicons. Most names have several diminutive forms.\n\n\n\nIn Belarus and most of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, surnames first appeared during the late Middle Ages. They initially denoted the differences between various people living in the same town or village and bearing the same name. The conventions were similar to those of English surnames, using occupations, patronymic descent, geographic origins, or personal characteristics.\n\nBelarusian surnames, like those in most of Europe, are hereditary and generally patrilineal, i.e., passed from the father on to his children.\n\nDepending on the region, Belarusian surnames could have a different form and different ending.\n\nOne very large group of surnames end with the common Slavonic suffixes -vič (wicz) and -ič (icz) (Daškievič, Šuškievič, Vajciuškievič, Mackievič, Mickievič, Misilievič) or -cki and -ski (feminine form -ckaja and -skaja: Navicki, Kalinoŭski, Piliecki, Rusiecki, Sadoŭski, Caŭloŭski, Bialiaŭski).\n\nOne common suffix in surnames is \"-čuk\" (Ramančuk, Kačuk, Kavaĺčuk) or its simplified versions \"-iuk\" and \"-juk\" (Maliuk, Masiuk).\n\nOther group includes surnames with the suffix \"-ka\", corresponding to the suffix \"-ko\" Ukrainian names (Lukašenka, Jakavienka, Haponienka), \"-onak, -jonak (-ionak)\" (Malašonak, Manionak).\n\nAnother suffix is \"-jenia (-ienia)\" (Majsienia, Astapienia, Jurčenia, Hierasimienia).\n\n\n"}

His parents were unable to support his studies for long, so he chose to support himself by selling copies of the old masters he made at the local museums, but eventually concluded that portrait painting would be most profitable. Soon after, he acquired an important patron; Count János Waldstein-Wartenberg (1809-1876), a well-known art collector. \n\nHe spent some time at the Count's estate in Várpalota, doing portraits, some of his first animal paintings and frescoes for the library at Zichy Castle. In 1867, he was able to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, thanks to a state grant that the Count was able to obtain for him from Prime Minister Gyula Andrássy. His primary instructor there was Eduard von Engerth.\n\nIn 1871, he received an extension of his grant and went to study at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where his teachers were Wilhelm von Diez and Karl von Piloty. It was there that he decided to devote himself to animal painting. He had his first showing at the 1873 World Exposition in Vienna. In 1874, he returned to Budapest and soon became popular with the aristocracy, so he continued to do portraits along with paintings of their favorite dogs and horses. \nBy 1880, he was successful enough to buy an old church, where he set up apartments and a studio. Unfortunately, the amount of work he had been doing created a severe case of eyestrain and, on his doctor's advice, he gave up painting for a while. Rather than remain inactive, he began to take singing lessons. In 1883, encouraged by his friends and family, he sold his studio (which later became a church again) and toured Germany; performing in several major cities, including Weimar, singing opera arias. He eventually learned thirty different operatic roles and was especially successful with the works of Richard Wagner. Düsseldorf became his base of operations and he spent his summers in Nordkirchen, at the Esterházy estates.\n\nOnce that he felt his eyes had sufficiently recovered, he had sheep brought to Düsseldorf and started painting again. With the help of Prince Nikolaus, he was able to re-establish himself in the art world. In 1887, he took up residence at the Esterházy Palace in Tata, where he continued to display his singing talent at the castle theater and directed some productions as well as painting the theater's ceiling. He also exhibited widely, including a show at the Salon in 1890. That same year, he acquired property in the Epreskert Art Colony and built a studio there. It is currently known as the \"Atelier Kernstok\" after a famous later resident, the artist Károly Kernstok.\n\n\n"}

Staton is a four-time Grammy Award nominee.\n\nAt the age of 11 or 12, Staton and her sister Maggie were sent to the Jewell Christian Academy in Nashville, Tennessee. Her vocal abilities quickly set her apart from the crowd; the school's pastor teamed the two sisters with a third girl (Naomi Harrison) to form the Jewell Gospel Trio. As teenagers, they toured the traditional gospel circuit in the 1950s with the Soul Stirrers, C. L. Franklin and Mahalia Jackson. They recorded several sides for Nashbro, Apollo and Savoy Records between 1953 and 1963.\n\nIn 1968, Staton was introduced to Rick Hall by Clarence Carter, who became her second husband in 1970, and launched her solo career as a Southern soul stylist, garnering 16 R&B hits for Rick Hall's Fame Studios and gaining the title of \"First Lady of Southern Soul\" for her Grammy-nominated R&B renditions of the songs \"Stand by Your Man\" and \"In the Ghetto\".

In that year she published at Melbourne a volume of poems \"The Explorers and other Poems.\" The book was credited to 'M.C.' and her name remained unknown to the public. She came to Adelaide and did journalistic work, including a serial story, \"Bohemian Born\". For a period she was a clerk in the Education Department.

His works are notable for their simplicity, balance, and good taste, and as the origin of a distinctive Federal style of classical domes, columns, and ornament that dominated early 19th-century American architecture.\n\nBulfinch was born in Boston to Thomas Bulfinch, a prominent physician, and his wife, Susan Apthorp. He was educated at Boston Latin School and Harvard University, from which he graduated with an AB in 1781 and master's degree in 1784.\n\nHe then made a grand tour of Europe from 1785 to 1787, where he was influenced by the classical architecture in Italy and the neoclassical buildings of Sir Christopher Wren, Robert Adam, William Chambers and others in the United Kingdom. Thomas Jefferson became something of a mentor to him in Europe, as he would later be to Robert Mills.\n\nUpon his return to the United States in 1787, he became a promoter of the ship Columbia Rediviva's voyage around the world under command of Captain Robert Gray (1755–1806). It was the first American ship to circumnavigate the globe. In 1788 he married Hannah Apthorp, his first cousin. Their sons include Thomas Bulfinch (1796–1867), author of \"Bulfinch's Mythology\", and Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch (1809–1870), Unitarian clergyman and author.\n\nBulfinch's first building was the Hollis Street Church (1788). Among his other early works are a memorial column on Beacon Hill (1789), the first monument to the American Revolution; the Federal Street theater (1793); the \"Tontine Crescent\" (built 1793–1794, now demolished), fashioned in part after John Wood's Royal Crescent; the Old State House in Hartford, Connecticut (1796); and the Massachusetts State House (1798). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1791.\n\nOver the course of ten years, Bulfinch built a remarkable number of private dwellings in the Boston area, including Joseph Barrell's Pleasant Hill (1793), a series of three houses in Boston for Harrison Gray Otis (1796, 1800, 1806), and the John Phillips House (1804). He built several churches in Boston, of which New North (built 1802–1804) is the last standing.\n\nServing from 1791 to 1795 on Boston's board of selectmen, he resigned due to business pressures but returned in 1799. From 1799 to 1817, he was the chairman of Boston's board of selectmen continuously, and served as a paid Police Superintendent, improving the city's streets, drains, and lighting. Under his direction, both the infrastructure and civic center of Boston were transformed into a dignified classical style. Bulfinch was responsible for the design of the Boston Common, the remodeling and enlargement of Faneuil Hall (1805), and the construction of India Wharf. In these Boston years he also designed the Massachusetts State Prison (1803); Boylston Market (1810); University Hall for Harvard University (1813–1814); the Meeting House in Lancaster, Massachusetts (1815–17); and the Bulfinch Building home of the Ether Dome at Massachusetts General Hospital (1818), its completion overseen by Alexander Parris, who was working in Bulfinch's office at the time the architect was summoned to Washington.\n\nDespite this great activity and civic involvement, Bulfinch was insolvent several times starting in 1796, including at the start of his work on the statehouse, and was jailed for the month of July 1811 for debt (in a prison he had designed himself). There was no payment for his services as selectman, and he received only $1,400 for designing and overseeing the construction of the State House.\n\nIn the summer of 1817, Bulfinch's roles as selectman, designer and public official coincided during a visit by President James Monroe. The two men were almost constantly in each other's company for the week-long visit, and a few months later (1818) Monroe appointed Bulfinch the successor to Benjamin Henry Latrobe (1764–1820) as Architect of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. (The Capitol Building had been partially burned by the British in 1814.) In this position he was paid a salary of $2,500 per year plus expenses.\n\nAs Commissioner of Public Building, Bulfinch completed the Capitol's wings and central portion, designed the western approach and portico, and constructed the Capitol's original low wooden dome to his own design (replaced by the present cast-iron dome completed in the mid-1860s). In 1829 Bulfinch completed the construction of the Capitol, 36 years after its cornerstone was laid. During his interval in Washington, Bulfinch also drew plans for the State House in Augusta, Maine (1829–1832), a Unitarian Church and prison in Washington, D.C.. In 1827, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary member. He returned to Boston in 1830, where he died on April 15, 1844, aged 80, and was buried in King's Chapel Burial Ground in Boston. His tomb was later moved to Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1943, a United States Liberty ship named the SS \"Charles Bulfinch\" was launched. The ship was scrapped in 1971.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The audit claims that 21 of the report's 44 chapters used fewer than 60% peer-reviewed sources, with the other sources being non-peer-reviewed material, commonly called \"grey literature\". The IPCC has clear guidelines allowing the use of non peer-reviewed grey literature where appropriate, subject to evaluation by the IPCC authors. An IPCC spokesman has stated that such sources include government statistics or reports from industry associations, and said \"We do not believe that it is appropriate to keep out such material from the process.\"\n\nIn 2011, she published a book about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \"The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World's Top Climate Expert\". She promotes her perspective on Global warming on her noconsensus.org blog. Laframboise claims that the IPCC's appeal to authority doesn't live up to its own promises. and this book has received some critical attention. Her 2011 book has been translated in Norwegian and German. The German translation was by (among others), a retired Geography professor affiliated with the German climate skeptical think tank . The Norwegian translation was provided by Jan-Erik Solheim, an astrophysicist at the University of Oslo, and Knut Bakke, a retired engineer. In September 2013, she published a new book, repeating her criticisms of IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri which she had originally published as blog posts. In a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed, she wrote that Pachauri had repeatedly claimed the IPCC based its conclusions solely on peer-reviewed literature.\n\nIn 2013, Laframboise received leaked drafts of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report WG II section on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, and commented on them on her blog. She wrote that NGOs like the World Wide Fund for Nature, Conservation International and Germanwatch had provided comments based on grey literature, to push a political agenda. IPCC Spokesman Jonathan Lynn commented that the data leak broke a confidentiality agreement which did not have legal force. Authors of the report also included industry representatives such as the insurer Munich Re and the oil company ExxonMobil.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

He won two elections with landslide margins in the Electoral College in both 1992 and 1996. Most of his early life was spent in his home state of Arkansas, where he was born and raised for his entire childhood in varying cities from Hope to Hot Springs. He served in multiple political offices in the state including as the state's Attorney General for two years and as the Governor for almost twelve total, but not consecutive, years.\n\nBill Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas. He was the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr. (1918–1946), a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley: 1923–1994). His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe had never divorced his third wife and was therefore still married to her.\nSoon after Bill was born, Virginia traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana to study nursing. She left her son in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store. At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races. In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas with his brother and Earl T. Ricks. The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.\nAlthough he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15 that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather. Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., to a point where he often had to threaten violence against Roger to protect them.\n\nAs a student in Hot Springs, Clinton attended several schools, including St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School. There, he was an active student leader, an avid reader, and a musician. Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music instead of politics, but as he noted in his autobiography \"My Life\":\n\nClinton began an interest in taking a career path in law at Hot Springs High when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class. After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck that it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\".\n\nClinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. The first was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet then-President John F. Kennedy. The second moment he has identified was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on television, impressing him so much that he ended up memorizing it. In 1998, during an address commemorating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the March on Washington, Clinton stated his belief that watching the march on television \"had a more profound impact\" on his life than his meeting with President Kennedy.\n\nBill Clinton met his future wife, Hillary, at Yale University and married her in 1975. They moved to Arkansas, where Clinton began to pursue a career in politics by running for and eventually being elected to the position of Attorney General of Arkansas. He was sworn into office in 1977. Had he not decided to study law, he may have never met Hillary at Yale.\n\nHe eventually decided to run for Governor of Arkansas two years later. He was sworn in as Governor for the first time in 1979. At the time, the Governor and Attorney General served only two-year terms. He lost his 1980 election, but ran again in 1982, and was therefore sworn in for the second time in 1983. During his tenure, the Arkansas General Assembly changed the constitution to have the Governor serve four-year terms. He subsequently ran again in 1984, 1986, and 1990. He resigned halfway through his last term after becoming elected President.\n"}

Hers was an international career, and she sang regularly at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, and the Royal Opera House, London.\n\nCalvé was born on 15 August 1858 in Decazeville, Aveyron. Her birth name was Rosa Emma Calvet. Her father, Justin Calvet, was a civil engineer. She spent her childhood at first in Spain with her parents, then in different convent schools in Roquefort and Tournemire (Aveyron). After her parents separated, she moved with her mother to Paris. There she attempted to enter the Paris Conservatory, while she studied singing under Jules Puget.\n\nShe started learning music in Paris from Mathilde Marchesi, a retired German mezzo-soprano and Manuel García. She made a tour of Italy, where she saw the famous actress Eleonora Duse, whose impersonations made a deep impression on the young singer. She trained herself in stage craft and gesture by closely observing Duse's performances.\n\nShe made her operatic debut on 23 September 1881 in Gounod's \"Faust\" at Brussels' La Monnaie. Later she sang at La Scala in Milan, and also at the principal theatres of Naples, Rome, and Florence.\n\nReturning to Paris in 1891, she created the part of Suzel in \"L'amico Fritz\" by Pietro Mascagni, playing and singing the role later at Rome. Because of her great success in it, she was chosen to appear as Santuzza in the French premiere of \"Cavalleria rusticana\", which was viewed as one of her greatest parts. She repeated her success in it in London.\n\nIn 1892, she spent 6 months in Rome, studying under Mustafa, the last castrato Head of the Sistine Chapel Choir, adding half an octave to the top of her range.\n\nHer next triumph was Bizet's \"Carmen\". Before beginning the study of this part, she went to Spain, learned the Spanish dances, mingled with the people and patterned her characterization after the cigarette girls whom she watched at their work and at play. In 1894, she made her appearance in the role at the Opéra-Comique, Paris. The city's opera-goers immediately hailed her as the greatest Carmen that had ever appeared, a verdict other cities would later echo. She had had many famous predecessors in the role, including Adelina Patti, Minnie Hauk and Célestine Galli-Marié, but critics and musicians agreed that in Calvé they had found their ideal of Bizet's cigarette girl of Seville.\n\nCalvé first appeared in America in the season of 1893–1894 as Mignon. She would make regular visits to the country, both in grand opera and in concert tours. After making her Metropolitan Opera debut as Santuzza, she went on to appear a total of 261 times with the company between 1893 and 1904. She created the part of Anita, which was written for her, in Massenet's \"La Navarraise\" in London in 1894 and sang \"Sapho\" in an opera written by the same composer.\n\nShe sang Ophélie in Ambroise Thomas's \"Hamlet\" in Paris in 1899, but the part was not suited to her and she dropped it. She appeared with success in many roles, among them, as the Countess in \"The Marriage of Figaro\", the title role in Félicien David's \"Lalla-Roukh\", as Pamina in \"The Magic Flute\", and as Camille in Hérold's \"Zampa\", but she is best known as Carmen.\n\nCalvé's Metropolitan Opera career ended abruptly in 1904, as Irving Kolodin described in his book THE METROPOLITAN OPERA [Knopf 1968]. She was to sing a group of Provençal songs at the Met's Sunday evening concert. Music director Felix Mottl was to accompany her at the piano. \"As they were about to begin, she turned and asked him to transpose the music a tone lower. When he refused, she walked off the stage and out of the Metropolitan's history. When she reappeared in New York, it was with Hammerstein's company (1907).\"\n\nCalvé developed an interest in the paranormal and was once engaged to the occult author Jules Bois.\n\nIn the winter of 1893/1894 the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) executed a life-size portrait of her standing full-length in a green-blue dress, wearing an opera cloak of white and gold with a sable edge, clutching American Beauty roses. It is now lost, but a pastel he made of her in March 1894 has been discovered in a London private collection.\n\nCalvé died on 6 January 1942 at Montpellier, Hérault, and is buried in Millau. Her voice is preserved in a number of recordings made between 1902 and 1920. These are available on CD transfers.\n\nCalvé wrote of Swami Vivekananda in her autobiography: \"[He] truly walked with God, a noble being, a saint, a philosopher and a true friend. His influence upon my spiritual life was profound [...] my soul will bear him eternal gratitude\".\n\nShe also visited Belur Math, Swami Vivekananda's tribute to his guru Ramakrishna Paramahansa. She said of this visit and her association with the monks there: \"The hours that I spent with these gentle philosophers have remained in my memory as a time apart. These beings – pure, beautiful and remote seemed to belong to another universe, a better and wiser world\"\n\nSwami Vivekananda wrote of Calvé:\nShe was born poor but by her innate talents, prodigious labour and diligence, and after wrestling against much hardship, she is now enormously rich and commands respect from kings and emperors...The rare combination of beauty, youth, talents, and \"divine\" voice has assigned Calve the highest place among the singers of the West. There is, indeed, no better teacher than misery and poverty. That constant fight against the dire poverty, misery, and hardship of the days of her girlhood, which has led to her present triumph over them, has brought into her life a unique sympathy and a depth of thought with a wide outlook.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Le Mesurier's career spanned from 1934 until his death in 1983. He is best remembered for his role as Sergeant Arthur Wilson in the BBC situation comedy \"Dad's Army\", between 1968 and 1977.\n\nLe Mesurier made his professional stage debut in September 1934 in \"Dangerous Corner\" at the Palladium Theatre in Edinburgh under his birth name, and appeared on television for the first time four years later as Seigneur de Miolans in the BBC Television broadcast of \"The Marvellous History of St Bernard\". The broadcast was adapted from a 15th-century manuscript by Henri Ghéon. After wartime service as a captain in the Royal Tank Regiment, Le Mesurier returned to acting and made his radio debut on the BBC Home Service in a March 1947 broadcast of \"Escape or Die\". He continued working in television roles throughout his career, but it was his portrayal in the BBC television play \"Traitor\", of a character loosely based on Kim Philby, which earned him the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor in 1972.\n\nIn 1948, Le Mesurier worked on his first film, \"Death in the Hand\", a mystery in which he played the character Jack Mottram.

He is based in Boulder, Colorado. His career spans over 30 years. In 2011, he was included by the Watkins Review as 74 on its list of \"100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People in the World\".\n\nAccording to Goldman, his interest in using sound as a healing modality originated from his own experiences during live performances as a guitarist in the Boston punk scene in the late 1970s. While playing, he became aware of how sound could be made to affect listeners, determined, in part, by the intention of the musician, not just the physical act of playing an instrument, nor the emotional energy expressed by the musician while playing. Based on these experiences, Goldman began to research the science of sound and music psychology, directing his overall studies towards the use of sound as a healing force.\n\nIn 1982, he founded the Sound Healers Association (SHA) in Lexington, Massachusetts. SHA was a small, informal gathering of musicians, artists, scientists, teachers and authors, and anyone interested in sound healing. Meetings were held in his home once a month and typically included a guest speaker's presentation, followed by a question-and-answer session. Guest speakers included Steven Halpern, John Beaulieu, Randall McClellan and Dr. Peter Guy Manners. Subjects discussed at SHA meetings included the work of Hans Jenny; Resonance; Musica universalis; Harmonics and Entrainment.\n\nDuring this time, Goldman worked on his master's degree program in Independent Study from Lesley University, researching the uses of sound and music for Healing, which became the main source of material for his first published works. He began recording his own music and he formed Spirit Music, one of the first record labels dedicated to the therapeutic use of sound and music.The label has recorded and released music by Goldman, as well as Don Campbell, Sarah Benson, Sam McClellan, Laraaji, the Gyume Monks and more recently, Lama Tashi, among others.\n\nGoldman's healing music and writing has been influenced by the early SHA meetings as well as mythology; psychology; multi-cultural music traditions; ancient religions; mathematics and speculative fiction. The theory that runs beneath all of his written and music works is:\n\n\nDuring his research, Goldman worked with the Gyume Monks, whose sacred chanting of ancient mantras is said to be encoded with healing properties and to be of great benefit to its listeners. Goldman met and became a student of the monks during their 1988 US Tour. During this time, Goldman recorded and produced a concert of the Gyume Monks' chanting, and he learned the art of deep voice chanting and the 'One Voice Chord' technique from the monks.\n\nHe later went on to meet the Tibetan Buddhist Monk, Rinchen Chugyal, then Chant Master for the Drepung Loseling Monastery. In 1995 Rinchen Chugyal ordained Goldman as a Chant Master, empowering him to teach Tibetan Chanting in the West. He also met the Venerable Ngawang Tashi Bapu (Lama Tashi), who succeeded Rinchen Chugyal as Chant Master. Lama Tashi recorded several sessions of Tibetan chanting with Goldman. His 'Tibetan Master Chants', recorded and produced by Goldman, was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2004.\n\nGoldman's chanting has been featured on several recordings, notably the 1999 Grammy Award-winning album by Kitaro, 'Thinking of You'; his own 'Chakra Chants' series; 'Chakra Dance', which was produced for the opening of a holistic dance club in New York City, and 'Medicine Buddha', made for the US teachings of the Dalai Lama in 2001.\n\nGoldman produces and hosts an annual 'Healing Sounds Intensive' course in Loveland, Colorado. He also hosts private clinics . He has lectured and taught internationally at major sound conferences and health expos, including National Music & Health Conference, Harvard University, Wesak Festival, American Association of Music Therapy Conference, Tufts University, Global Sound Conference and the University of Hawaii. He also is the presenter of a monthly online radio show on www.healthylife.net.\n\nAs of June 2018, there are over 30 albums of Jonathan Goldman's own music released on Spirit Music and other labels. His music has ranged from new-age, chanting, ambient, minimalist, to techno as well as music intended to be played during specific activities such as meditation, reiki yoga and massage. In 2011 Jonathan Goldman was inducted into the Massage Therapy Hall of Fame. In Spring 2011, Jonathan was named as one of Watkins’ Mind Body Spirit magazine’s “100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People.”\n\nAs of June 2018 Goldman has written eight books in the field of sound healing which have been published. Four of Goldman's books have been published in numerous languages and are Best Sellers.\n\nGoldman continues to work out of his private recording studio, Spirit Studios, which is located in his home in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nGoldman grew up in New Jersey, at a family-owned kosher hotel. His father, Irving B. Goldman was an otolaryngologist and plastic surgeon. Jonathan's wife, Andi Goldman, is a licensed therapist.\n\n"}

He is considered to have been the creator of the Corps of Military Engineers of the Chilean Army.\n\nHe was born John MacKenna (or Seán Mac Cionath in Irish) in Monaghan, Co. Monaghan, Ireland, the son of William MacKenna of Willville House near Monaghan town and Eleanora O'Reilly and, on his mother's side, a nephew to Count Alejandro O'Reilly. Count O'Reilly took an interest in the young Mackenna and took him to Spain where he studied at the Royal School of Mathematics in Barcelona. He also trained in the Royal Military Academy as a Military Engineer between 1785 and 1791.\n\nIn 1787 he was accepted into the Irish Brigade of the Spanish army, and joined the army fighting in Ceuta in northern Africa, under Lieutenant Colonel Luis Urbina, and was promoted to Second Lieutenant. In 1791 Mackenna resumed his studies in Barcelona and acted as liaison with mercenaries recruited in Europe. The following year he was promoted to Lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Engineers. In the War of the Pyrenees against the French, Juan Mackenna fought in Rosselló under General Ricardos and there met the future liberator of Argentina, José de San Martín. For his exploits in defence of the Plaza de Rozas, he was promoted to captain in 1795.\n\nFor the purpose of a new assignment, in October 1796, Juan Mackenna left Spain for South America. He arrived in Buenos Aires and then travelled to Mendoza and to Chile across the Andes and then to Peru. Once in Lima, he contacted Ambrosio O'Higgins, another Irishman, at that time Viceroy of Perú, who named him Governor of Osorno and put him in charge of the reconstruction works for this southern Chilean town.\n\nIn this capacity, Juan Mackenna convinced the families of Castro, on the island of Chiloé, to move to Osorno to found a colony there. He built the storehouse and two mills, as well as the road between Osorno and present-day Puerto Montt. His successful administration provoked jealousy from Chile's captain-general Gabriel de Avilés, who feared that Juan Mackenna and Ambrosio O'Higgins would create an Irish colony in Osorno. Both Irishmen were loyal to the Spanish crown, though Juan Mackenna had good relations with O'Higgins' son Bernardo, the future emancipator of Chile, and was also connected with the Venezuelan Francisco de Miranda and his group of supporters of South American independence. When Ambrosio O'Higgins died in 1801, Avilés was appointed viceroy of Peru. It took him eight years to remove O'Higgins's protégé Juan Mackenna from Osorno.\n\nIn 1809 Juan Mackenna married Josefina Vicuña y Larraín, an eighteen-year-old Chilean woman from a family with revolutionary connections, with whom he had three children: María del Carmen Dolores, Juan Francisco María del Tránsito, and Félix. After the Declaration of Chilean Independence in 1810, he adhered to the Patriot side and was commissioned by the first Chilean government to prepare a plan for the defense of the country and oversaw the equipment of the new Chilean Army. At this juncture he trained the first military engineers for the new army.\n\nThe following year he was called to the defence committee of the new Republic of Chile, and in 1811 was appointed governor of Valparaíso. Owing to political feuds with José Miguel Carrera and his brothers, Juan Mackenna was dismissed from the post and taken prisoner. He was a firm ally of Bernardo O'Higgins, who appointed him as one of the key officers to fight the Spanish army of General Antonio Pareja. Mackenna's major military honour was attained in 1814 at the Battle of Membrillar, in which the general assured a temporary collapse of the royal forces.\n\nAs a reward for his victory, he was appointed commandant-general by Bernardo O'Higgins, but after a coup d'état led by Luis Carrera he was exiled to Argentina in 1814, when Carrera took over power. Juan Mackenna died in Buenos Aires late in 1814, after a duel with Luis Carrera.\n\nA bust of General MacKenna was publicly presented to Monaghan County Museum on 5 August 2004 by his direct descendant . At the presentation ceremony General MacKenna, the man \"unreservedly regarded as the greatest of Co. Monaghan's exiles\" was commemorated in speeches by Most Rev. Dr Joseph Duffy, Bishop of Clogher and by his descendant Senor Ferrada who declared, \"In this city of Monaghan, very near to Willville House, the tombs of my ancestors are in the old cemetery. There, my own blood is interred in the sacred earth.\"\n\nMackenna was the great-grandfather of Chilean composer Carmela Mackenna.\n\n\n\n"}

He played college football for the TCU Horned Frogs at Texas Christian University. Berry was selected in the 1950 NFL Draft, and played professional football for two seasons with the Edmonton Eskimos in what later became the Canadian Football League (CFL). In 1950, he received the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy for the CFL West Division's most valuable player.\n\nBerry attended Wichita Falls High School in Wichita Falls, Texas. While there, he played football under head coach Thurman \"Tugboat\" Jones. During his junior season in 1944, he led the Coyotes to an 8–3 record and the district championship. Nevertheless, Berry said, \"There was this café in town where people went on Saturday mornings to rehash the game from the night before. One morning I heard a couple of guys in there talking about me. One said, 'He will never make it.' I said to myself, 'We'll see.'\" As a senior in 1945, Berry led Wichita Falls to an 11–1–1 record. The Coyotes' sole loss was to the eventual state champions, Highland Park High School, which eliminated Wichita Falls in the semifinals.\n\nBerry attended Texas Christian University where he played on the Horned Frogs varsity football team all four seasons. In addition to playing quarterback, he was also TCU's punt and kickoff returner and played safety on defense. His passing duo with end Morris Bailey was nicknamed the \"Berry-to-Bailey Battery.\" Wichita Falls' \"Times Record News\" reported an incident that demonstrated Berry was \"tough as nails\". In one unspecified game against the Texas Longhorns, Berry dropped back in the pocket looking to pass. A Longhorns defender, Errol Fry, dodged a block and sacked Berry. During the tackle, Fry's elbow struck Berry in the face and knocked out two of his front teeth and broke his jaw. Nevertheless, Berry played the following week, while wearing a hockey mask to protect his jaw that had been wired shut.\n\nHe earned his first letter as a freshman in 1946. In 1947, he led the team in passing with 429 yards, 31 completions on 67 attempts, and one touchdown. He also led the team in rushing with 379 yards on 112 attempts and four touchdowns. In 1948, Berry recorded 706 passing yards, 61 completions on 134 attempts, and two touchdowns. Midway through the season, he ranked second in the nation in total offensive yards until surpassed by Charlie Justice of North Carolina. Berry finished the season as the team's rushing leader with 783 yards on 190 attempts and four touchdowns. He was named an All-Southwest Conference selection. He also received the Rogers Trophy as the team's most valuable player. In 1949, Berry compiled 1,445 passing yards, 106 completions on 220 attempts, and seven touchdowns. He also threw 23 interceptions, which to date remains the school record. He was named a first-team All-American and an All-Southwest Conference selection. After the season, he participated in the East-West Shrine Game. During that season, he compiled 1,445 passing yards in 10 games. At the time, only one other TCU quarterback had exceeded that in a season, Heisman Trophy winner Davey O'Brien, and he had the benefit of playing in one additional game.\n\nDuring his college career, Berry had recorded 1,745 rushing yards, 1,372 punt return yards, 729 kickoff return yards, 185 interception return yards, and 32 receiving yards. He graduated from TCU as its all-time career leader in all-purpose yardage, a distinction which stood through the mid-1980s when his mark was surpassed by Tony Jeffery. Berry's 2,101 total kick return yards set a school record that stood until 2005, when it was broken by Cory Rodgers.\n\nBerry was selected in the seventh round of the 1950 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers as the 89th overall pick. He played two seasons for the Edmonton Eskimos in what later became known as the Canadian Football League (CFL) from 1950 to 1951. He was awarded the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy in 1950 as the West Division's most valuable player. He was named to the CFL's 1950 All-West second team.\n\nIn 1951, Berry married Mary, the secretary of his former college coach Dutch Meyer. Their grandson, Charlie Berry, played for Highland Park High School and the SMU Mustangs at Southern Methodist University as a defensive lineman. Since those are both rivals of the elder Berry's alma maters, he said, \"It wasn't easy but I had to cheer for Charlie.\"\n\nBerry was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2004. In 2008, he was inducted into the Oil Bowl Hall of Fame, which honors the most outstanding past participants of a high school football all-star game between Texas and Oklahoma players. That same year, \"Sports Illustrated\" listed him among six others as \"worthy of consideration\" as the best player to have ever worn the number 43.\n\nBerry is the great-uncle of Lana Berry, a popular figure on Twitter and other social media sites, and sports podcaster. \n\n"}

The law requires all citizens of Turkey to adopt the use of hereditary, fixed, surnames. Much of the population, particularly in the cities as well as Turkey's Christian and Jewish citizens, already had surnames, and all families had names by which they were known locally. The Surname Law of 1934 enforced not only the use of official surnames but also stipulated that citizens choose Turkish names. Until it was repealed in 2013 in Turkey the eldest male was the head of household and the law appointed him to choose the surname. However in his absence, death or mental incapacitation the wife would do so.\n\nThis law was modeled after a 1926 Fascist Italianization law 'restoring' German, Slovene and Croat surnames to their 'original Italian form'.\n\nMuslims in the Ottoman Empire carried titles such as “Pasha”, “Hoca”, “Bey”, “Hanım”, “Efendi”, etc. These titles either defined their formal profession (such as Pasha, Hoca, etc.) or their informal status within the society (such as Bey, Hanım, Efendi, etc.). Ottoman prime ministers (Sadrazam/Vezir-î Azam or Grand Vizier), ministers (Nazır/Vezir or Vizier) and other high-ranking civil servants also carried the title Pasha. Retired generals/admirals or high-ranking civil servants continued to carry this title in civilian life. A “Pasha” did not become a “Bey” after retiring from active military or political service.\n\nThe articles of the Soy Adı Kanunu stipulated that: \n\nThe surname law specifically forbade certain surnames that contained connotations of foreign cultures, nations, tribes, and religions. New surnames had to be taken from the Turkish language. The surname could be used with the \"oğlu\" ending, and it was forbidden to use Armenian endings such as \"ian\" or \"yan\", Slavic endings such as \"of\" (or \"ov\"), \"vich\", \"ic\", Greek endings such as \"is\", \"dis\", \"pulos\", \"aki\", Persian endings such as \"zade\", and Arab endings such as \"mahdumu\", \"veled\", and \"bin\", \"referring to other ethnicities or taken from another language.\" For example, names such as \"Arnavutoğlu\" (the Albanian’s son) or \"Kürtoğlu\" (the Kurd’s son), could not be used. Names of clans or tribes could not be used, or re-used. Additionally, names could not be duplicated in the same district, and, in case of any dispute, the family that registered first got the right to keep the claimed name.\n\nAs a result, many Greeks, Bulgarians, Albanians, Bosniaks, Jews, Arabs, Armenians, Assyrians, Georgians and Kurds were and are still forced to adopt last names of a more Turkish rendition, sometimes directly translating their original surnames, or otherwise just replacing markers such as Pontic Greek “ides” (son of) with Turkish “oğlu” (Kazantzoglou, Mitroglou, Mouratoglou, etc.).\n\n"}
{"id": "83094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83094", "title": "Tereus", "text": "Tereus\n\nIn Greek mythology, Tereus (; Ancient Greek: Τηρεύς means \"watcher\") was a Thracian king, the son of Ares and the naiad Bistonis. He was the brother of Dryas. Tereus was the husband of the Athenian princess Procne and the father of Itys.\n\nWhen Tereus desired his wife's sister, Philomela, he came to Athens to his father-in-law Pandion to ask for his other daughter in marriage, stating that Procne had died. Pandion granted him the favour, and sent Philomela and guards along with her. But Tereus threw the guards into the sea, and finding Philomela on a mountain, forced himself upon her. He then cut her tongue out and held her captive so she could never tell anyone. After he returned to Thrace, Tereus gave Philomela to King Lynceus and told his wife that her sister had died. Philomela wove letters in a tapestry depicting Tereus's crime and sent it secretly to Procne. Lynceus' wife Lathusa who was a friend of Procne, at once sent the concubine (Philomela) to her. \n\nWhen Procne recognized her sister and knew the impious deed of Tereus, the two planned to return the favour to the king. Meanwhile it was revealed to Tereus by prodigies that death by a relative's hand was coming to his son Itys. When he heard this, thinking that his brother Dryas was plotting his son's death, he killed the innocent man. Procne, however, killed her son Itys by Tereus, served his flesh in a meal at his father's table in revenge, and fled with her sister.\n\nWhen Tereus learned what the crime she had done, he pursued the sisters and tried to kill them but all three were changed by the Olympian Gods into birds out of pity: Tereus became a hoopoe or a hawk; Procne became the swallow whose song is a song of mourning for the loss of her child; Philomela became the nightingale. Incidentally, the female nightingale has no song. (Hyginus, \"Fabulae\", 45).\n\nTereus was also a common given name among Thracians.\n\nThe Attic playwrights Sophocles and Philocles both wrote plays entitled \"Tereus\" on the subject of the story of Tereus.\n\nShakespeare refers to Tereus in \"Titus Andronicus\", after Chiron and Demetrius have raped Lavinia and cut out her tongue and also both her hands.

{"id": "1812610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812610", "title": "Vættir", "text": "Vættir\n\nThe Vættir (Old Norse; singular Vættr) of Norse myth are spirits. The term can be used to refer to the full Norse cosmos of supernatural beings, including the Álfar (elves), Dvergar (dwarves), Jötnar (giants), and gods (the Æsir and Vanir). Vættir can also refer more specifically to Landvættir (nature spirits), Sjóvættir (sea spirits), vatnavættir (guardians of the specific waters), or Húsvættir (house spirits.) \n\nThe Old Norse term \"véttr/vættr\" and its English cognate \"wight\" are descended from Proto-Germanic \"*wihtiz\" (thing, creature), from Proto-Indo-European \"*wekti-\" (\"object, thing\"). Vættr and wight normally refer to supernatural 'being', especially landvættr (land spirit), but can refer to any creature. The Norwegian \"vette\" is used much in the same way as the Old Norse \"vættr\", as are the corresponding Swedish cognate \"vätte\" (dialect form vätter - Old Swedish vætter) and the Danish \"vætte\". A related form in the Slavic languages can be seen in Old Church Slavonic \"вєшть\", (veštĭ), meaning thing, matter, or subject.\n\nLandvættir (land spirits) are chthonic guardians of specific grounds, such as wild places or farms. When Vikings approached land, they reportedly removed their carved dragon heads from the bows of their longships, so as not to frighten and thus provoke the \"landvættir\" to attack, thereby incur bad luck from them. Icelandic culture continues to celebrate the supernatural protection over the island, and four \"landvættr\" can still be seen in the Icelandic coat-of-arms: a troll-bull, troll-eagle, dragon, and handsome giant. The troll-animals are actually Jötnar who shapeshifted into the form (and mentality) of an animal, and such animals are supernaturally strong. Even the dragon is generally a troll-snake: compare the Jötunn Loki whose children include a wolf, a serpent, and a horse.\n\nHúsvættir is a collective term for keepers of the household, like the English brownie and the Swedish \"tomte\". The \"tomte\" or \"nisse\" is a solitary vätte, living on the farmstead. He is usually benevolent and helpful, which can not be said about an innately mischievous \"illvätte\". However, a \"nisse\" can cause a lot of damage if he is displeased or angry, including killing of livestock or causing serious accidents.\n\nScandinavian folklore features a class of beings similar to the Old Norse \"landvættir\". They are known by many names, although the most common are \"vättar\" in southern Sweden (singular: vätte), \"vittra\" in northern Sweden and \"huldrefolk\" in Norway (although the singular \"vittra\" and \"huldra\", respectively, refer to a solitary and quite different being).\n\nDuring the 19th century, Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe compiled the folk tales among Norwegians, as part of the emotive, nationalistic and anti-rational values of the Romantic Era. These stories reflected the animistic 'folk belief' that preserved earlier elements deriving from the Viking Age but strongly influenced by the medieval Biblical cosmology of Germany, Britain and France. Prominent are stories that reflect later views of the Vættir, usually called the Huldrefolk (from Old Norse Huldufólk), meaning 'concealed people' and referring to their otherworldliness or their power of invisibility.\n\nThe English surname 'Wightman' retains the meaning of the word 'wight' and could be transliterated as 'Elf-friend'.\n\n\n\n"}
