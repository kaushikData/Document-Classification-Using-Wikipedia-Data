{"id": "18951309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18951309", "title": "Ambrose Bierce", "text": "Ambrose Bierce\n\nAmbrose Gwinnett Bierce (June 24, 1842 – circa 1914) was an American short story writer, journalist, poet, and Civil War veteran.\n\nBierce's book \"The Devil's Dictionary\" was named as one of \"The 100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature\" by the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration. His story \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" has been described as \"one of the most famous and frequently anthologized stories in American literature\"; and his book \"Tales of Soldiers and Civilians\" (also published as \"In the Midst of Life\") was named by the Grolier Club as one of the 100 most influential American books printed before 1900.\n\nA prolific and versatile writer, Bierce was regarded as one of the most influential journalists in the United States, and as a pioneering writer of realist fiction. For his horror writing, Michael Dirda ranked him alongside Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft. His war stories influenced Stephen Crane, Ernest Hemingway, and others, and he was considered an influential and feared literary critic. In recent decades Bierce has gained wider respect as a fabulist and for his poetry.\n\nIn December 1913, Bierce traveled to Chihuahua, Mexico, to gain first-hand experience of the Mexican Revolution. He disappeared, and was rumored to be traveling with rebel troops. He was never seen again.\n\nBierce was born in a log cabin at Horse Cave Creek in Meigs County, Ohio, on June 24, 1842, to Marcus Aurelius Bierce (1799–1876) and Laura Sherwood Bierce. He was of entirely English ancestry: all of his forebears came to North America between 1620 and 1640 as part of the Great Puritan Migration. He often wrote critically of both \"Puritan values\" and people who \"made a fuss\" about genealogy. He was the tenth of thirteen children, all of whom were given names by their father beginning with the letter \"A\": in order of birth, the Bierce siblings were Abigail, Amelia, Ann, Addison, Aurelius, Augustus, Almeda, Andrew, Albert, and Ambrose. His mother was a descendant of William Bradford.\n\nHis parents were a poor but literary couple who instilled in him a deep love for books and writing. Bierce grew up in Kosciusko County, Indiana, attending high school at the county seat, Warsaw.\n\nHe left home at 15 to become a printer's devil at a small abolitionist Ohio newspaper, the \"Northern Indianan\".\n\nAt the outset of the American Civil War, Bierce enlisted in the Union Army's 9th Indiana Infantry. He participated in the operations in Western Virginia (1861), was present at the Battle of Philippi (the first organized land action of the war), and received newspaper attention for his daring rescue, under fire, of a gravely wounded comrade at the Battle of Rich Mountain. Bierce fought at the Battle of Shiloh (April 1862), a terrifying experience that became a source for several short stories and the memoir \"What I Saw of Shiloh\".\n\nIn April 1863 he was commissioned a first lieutenant, and served on the staff of General William Babcock Hazen as a topographical engineer, making maps of likely battlefields. As a staff officer, Bierce became known to leading generals such as George H. Thomas and Oliver O. Howard, both of whom supported his application for admission to West Point in May 1864. General Hazen believed Bierce would graduate from the military academy \"with distinction\" and William T. Sherman also endorsed the application for admission even though stating he had no personal acquaintance with Bierce. In June 1864, Bierce sustained a serious head wound at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, and spent the rest of the summer on furlough, returning to active duty in September. He was discharged from the army in January 1865.\n\nHis military career resumed, however, in mid-1866, when he joined General Hazen as part of an expedition to inspect military outposts across the Great Plains. The expedition traveled by horseback and wagon from Omaha, Nebraska, arriving toward year's end in San Francisco, California.\n\nBierce married Mary Ellen \"Mollie\" Day on December 25, 1871. They had three children: sons Day (1872–1889) and Leigh (1874–1901) and daughter Helen (1875–1940). Both of Bierce's sons died before he did. Day committed suicide after a romantic rejection, and Leigh died of pneumonia related to alcoholism. Bierce separated from his wife in 1888, after discovering compromising letters to her from an admirer. They divorced in 1904. Mollie Day Bierce died the following year.\n\nBierce was an avowed agnostic. He suffered from lifelong asthma, as well as complications from his war wounds.\n\nIn San Francisco, Bierce was awarded the rank of brevet major before resigning from the Army. He remained in San Francisco for many years, eventually becoming famous as a contributor or editor of a number of local newspapers and periodicals, including \"The San Francisco News Letter\", \"The Argonaut\", the \"Overland Monthly\", \"The Californian\" and \"The Wasp\". A selection of his crime reporting from \"The San Francisco News Letter\" was included in The Library of America anthology \"True Crime\".\n\nBierce lived and wrote in England from 1872 to 1875, contributing to \"Fun\" magazine. His first book, \"The Fiend's Delight\", a compilation of his articles, was published in London in 1873 by John Camden Hotten under the pseudonym \"Dod Grile\".\n\nReturning to the United States, he again took up residence in San Francisco. From 1879 to 1880, he traveled to Rockerville and Deadwood in the Dakota Territory, to try his hand as local manager for a New York mining company. When the company failed he returned to San Francisco and resumed his career in journalism.\n\nFrom January 1, 1881 until September 11, 1885 he was editor of \"The Wasp\" magazine, in which he began a column titled \"Prattle\". He also became one of the first regular columnists and editorialists on William Randolph Hearst's newspaper, \"The San Francisco Examiner\", eventually becoming one of the most prominent and influential writers and journalists of the West Coast. He remained associated with Hearst Newspapers until 1909.\n\nThe Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroad companies had received large, low-interest loans from the U.S. government to build the First Transcontinental Railroad. Central Pacific executive Collis P. Huntington persuaded a friendly member of Congress to introduce a bill excusing the companies from repaying the loans, amounting to $130 million (worth $ today).\nIn January 1896 Hearst dispatched Bierce to Washington, D.C. to foil this attempt. The essence of the plot was secrecy; the railroads' advocates hoped to get the bill through Congress without any public notice or hearings. When the angered Huntington confronted Bierce on the steps of the Capitol and told Bierce to name his price, Bierce's answer ended up in newspapers nationwide: \"My price is one hundred thirty million dollars. If, when you are ready to pay, I happen to be out of town, you may hand it over to my friend, the Treasurer of the United States.\"\n\nBierce's coverage and diatribes on the subject aroused such public wrath that the bill was defeated. Bierce returned to California in November.\n\nBecause of his penchant for biting social criticism and satire, Bierce's long newspaper career was often steeped in controversy. On several occasions his columns stirred up a storm of hostile reaction, which created difficulties for Hearst. One of the most notable of these incidents occurred following the assassination of President William McKinley, when Hearst's opponents turned a poem Bierce had written about the assassination of Governor William Goebel of Kentucky in 1900 into a \"cause célèbre\".\n\nBierce meant his poem to express a national mood of dismay and fear, but after McKinley was shot in 1901, it seemed to foreshadow the crime:\n\nHearst was thereby accused by rival newspapers—and by then-Secretary of State Elihu Root—of having called for McKinley's assassination. Despite a national uproar that ended his ambitions for the presidency (and even his membership in the Bohemian Club), Hearst kept employing Bierce.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Bierce was better known as a journalist than as a fiction writer. His most popular stories were written in rapid succession between 1888 and 1891, in what was characterized as \"a tremendous burst of consummate art\". Bierce's works often highlight the inscrutability of the universe and the absurdity of death.\n\nBierce wrote realistically of the terrible things he had seen in the war in such stories as \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\", \"A Horseman in the Sky\", \"One of the Missing\", and \"\". His grimly realistic cycle of 25 war stories has been called \"the greatest anti-war document in American literature\".\n\nAccording to Milton Subotsky, Bierce helped pioneer the psychological horror story. In addition to his ghost and war stories, he also published several volumes of poetry. His \"Fantastic Fables\" anticipated the ironic style of grotesquerie that became a more common genre in the 20th century.\n\nOne of Bierce's most famous works is his much-quoted \"The Devil's Dictionary\", originally an occasional newspaper item, first published in book form in 1906 as \"The Cynic's Word Book.\" Described as \"howlingly funny\", it consists of satirical definitions of English words which lampoon cant and political double-talk. Bierce edited the twelve volumes of \"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce\", which were published from 1909 to 1912. The seventh volume consists solely of \"The Devil's Dictionary\".\n\nBierce has been criticized by his contemporaries and later scholars for deliberately pursuing improbability and for his penchant toward \"trick endings\". In his later stories, apparently under the influence of Maupassant, Bierce \"dedicated himself to shocking the audience\", as if his purpose was \"to attack the reader's smug intellectual security\".\n\nBierce's bias towards Naturalism has also been noted: \"The biting, deriding quality of his satire, unbalanced by any compassion for his targets, was often taken as petty meanness, showing contempt for humanity and an intolerance to the point of merciless cruelty\".\n\nStephen Crane was of the minority of Bierce's contemporaries who valued Bierce's experimental short stories. In his essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", H. P. Lovecraft characterized Bierce's fictional work as \"grim and savage.\" Lovecraft goes on to say that nearly all of Bierce's stories are of the horror genre and some shine as great examples of weird fiction.\n\nCritic William Dean Howells said, \"Mr. Bierce is among our three greatest writers.\" When told this, Bierce responded, \"I am sure Mr. Howells is the other two.\"\n\nIn October 1913, Bierce, then age 71, departed from Washington, D.C. for a tour of his old Civil War battlefields. By December he had passed through Louisiana and Texas, crossing by way of El Paso into Mexico, which was in the throes of revolution. In Ciudad Juárez he joined Pancho Villa's army as an observer, and in that role he witnessed the Battle of Tierra Blanca.\n\nBierce is known to have accompanied Villa's army as far as the city of Chihuahua. His last known communication with the world was a letter he wrote there to Blanche Partington, a close friend, dated December 26, 1913. After closing this letter by saying, \"As to me, I leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination,\" he vanished without a trace, his disappearance becoming one of the most famous in American literary history. Skeptic Joe Nickell argued that no letter had ever been found; all that existed was a notebook belonging to his secretary and companion, Carrie Christiansen, containing a rough summary of a purported letter and her statement that the originals had been destroyed.\n\nThere was an official investigation by U.S. consular officials of the disappearance of one of its citizens. Some of Villa's men were questioned at the time of his disappearance and afterwards, with contradictory accounts. Pancho Villa's representative in the U.S., Felix A. Sommerfeld, was contacted by U.S. chief of staff Hugh L. Scott and Sommerfeld investigated the disappearance. Bierce was said to have been last seen in the city of Chihuahua in January.\n\nOral tradition in Sierra Mojada, Coahuila, documented by a priest named James Lienert, states that Bierce was executed by firing squad in the town cemetery there. However, Nickell finds this story to be unreliable. He quotes Bierce's friend and biographer Walter Neale as saying that Bierce had not ridden for quite some time, was suffering from serious asthma, and had been severely critical of Pancho Villa. Neale concludes that it would have been highly unlikely for Bierce to have gone to Mexico and joined Villa.\n\nAll investigations into his fate have proven fruitless, and Nickell concedes that despite a lack of hard evidence that Bierce had gone to Mexico, there is also none that he had not. Therefore, despite an abundance of theories (including death by suicide), his ultimate fate remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nBierce has been fictionalized in more than 50 novels, short stories, movies, television shows, stage plays, and comic books. Most of these works draw upon Bierce's vivid personality, colorful wit, relationships with famous people such as Jack London or William Randolph Hearst, or, quite frequently, his mysterious disappearance.\n\nBierce has been portrayed by such well-known authors as Ray Bradbury, Jack Finney, Carlos Fuentes, Winston Groom, Robert Heinlein, and Don Swaim. Some works featuring a fictional Ambrose Bierce have received favorable reviews, generated international sales, or earned major awards.\n\nBierce's short stories, \"Haita the Shepherd\" and \"An Inhabitant of Carcosa\" are believed to have influenced early weird fiction writer Robert W. Chambers' tales of The King in Yellow (1895), which featured Hastur, Carcosa, Lake Hali and other names and locations initiated in these tales. Chambers in turn went on to influence H. P. Lovecraft and much of modern horror fiction.\n\nIn 1918, H. L. Mencken called Bierce \"the one genuine wit that These States have ever seen.\"\n\nAt least three films have been made of Bierce's story \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\". A silent film version, \"The Bridge\", was made in 1929. A French version called \"La Rivière du Hibou\", directed by Robert Enrico, was released in 1962; this black-and-white film faithfully recounts the original narrative using voiceover. It aired in 1964 on American television as one of the final episodes of the television series \"The Twilight Zone\": \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\". Prior to \"The Twilight Zone\", the story had been adapted as an episode of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". Another version, directed by Brian James Egen, was released in 2005. It was also adapted for the CBS radio programs \"Suspense\" and \"Escape\".\n\nIn his 1932 book \"Wild Talents\", American writer and researcher into anomalous phenomena Charles Fort wrote about the unexplained disappearances of Ambrose Bierce and Ambrose Small, and asked, \"Was somebody collecting Ambroses?\"\n\nActor James Lanphier (1920-1969) played Bierce, with James Hampton as William Randolph Hearst, in the 1964 episode \"The Paper Dynasty\", of the syndicated western television series \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Hearst struggles to turn a profit despite increased circulation of \"The San Francisco Examiner\". Robert O. Cornthwaite appears as Sam Chamberlain.\n\nCarlos Fuentes's 1985 novel \"The Old Gringo\" is a fictionalized account of Bierce's disappearance; it was later adapted into the film \"Old Gringo\" (1989), starring Gregory Peck in the title role. Fuentes stated: \"What started this novel was my admiration for Ambrose Bierce and for his \"Tales of Soldiers and Civilians\".\"\n\nTwo adaptations were made of Bierce's story \"Eyes of the Panther\". One version was developed for Shelley Duvall's \"Nightmare Classics\" series and was released in 1990. It runs about 60 minutes. A shorter version was released in 2007 by director Michael Barton and runs about 23 minutes.\n\nBierce was a major character in a series of mystery books written by Oakley Hall and published between 1998 and 2006.\n\nBiographer Richard O'Conner argued that, \"War was the making of Bierce as a man and a writer... [he became] truly capable of transferring the bloody, headless bodies and boar-eaten corpses of the battlefield onto paper.\"\n\nEssayist Clifton Fadiman wrote, \"Bierce was never a great writer. He has painful faults of vulgarity and cheapness of imagination. But... his style, for one thing, will preserve him; and the purity of his misanthropy, too, will help to keep him alive.\"\n\nAuthor Alan Gullette argues that Bierce's war tales may be the best writing on war, outranking his contemporary Stephen Crane (author of \"The Red Badge of Courage\") and even Ernest Hemingway.\n\nThe short film \"Ah! Silenciosa\" (1999), starring Jim Beaver as Bierce, weaves elements of \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" into a speculation on Bierce's disappearance.\n\nBierce's disappearance and trip to Mexico provide the background for the vampire horror film \"\" (2000), in which Bierce's character plays a central role. Bierce's fate is the subject of Gerald Kersh's \"The Oxoxoco Bottle\" (aka \"The Secret of the Bottle\"), which appeared in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" on December 7, 1957, and was reprinted in the anthology \"Men Without Bones\". Bierce reappears in the future on Mount Shasta in Robert Heinlein's novella, \"Lost Legacy\".\n\nIn the fall of 2001, \"An Occurrence Remembered\", a theatrical retelling of Bierce's \"An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge\" and \"Chickamauga\", premiered off-Broadway in New York City under the production and direction of Lorin Morgan-Richards and lead choreographer Nicole Cavaliere.\n\nAmerican composer Rodney Waschka II composed an opera, \"Saint Ambrose\" (2002), based on Bierce's life.\n\nIn 2005, author Kurt Vonnegut stated that he considered \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" the \"greatest American short story\" and a work of \"flawless... American genius\".\n\n\"The Damned Thing\" was adapted into a 2006 \"Masters of Horror\" episode of the same title directed by Tobe Hooper.\n\nDon Swaim writes of Bierce's life and disappearance in \"The Assassination of Ambrose Bierce: A Love Story\" (2015).\n\nAmbrose Bierce features as a character in Winston Groom's 2016 novel \"El Paso\". In the novel, Bierce is personally executed by Pancho Villa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbrose Bierce was a prolific writer of short fiction. He wrote 249 short stories, 846 fables, and more than 300 humorous Little Johnny stories. The following list provides links to more information about notable stories by Bierce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1804, with the Armatolos Vassilios Romfeis, he defended Naoussa from the attacking forces of Ali Pasha, but he didn't managed to save the city, that was captured five months later. In March 1821, when Emmanouel Pappas started the Revolution in Chalkidiki, he collaborated with him trying to spread it through the entire region, but their actions were not well coordinated. Large numbers of Ottoman forces from Thessaloniki were able to defeat the Greek revolutionary forces, and Emmanuel Pappas was retired to Mount Athos. He returned to Naoussa which was liberated from Ottomans on February 19, 1822 under the leadership of Zafeirakis Theodosiou. \n\nIn April 1822, the Pasha οf Thessaloniki, Abdul Abut with 18,000 men besieged Naoussa, and, fourteen days later, he captured and destroyed the city.

She became a nationally renowned motivational speaker.\n\nAslaug Haviland was born in Bergen, Norway, January 19, 1913. At age 12 she contracted scarlet fever, and as a result lost both her hearing and vision. Little is known about her early life except that after the loss of her hearing she first attended Norway's school for the deaf, where she learned sign language, and later went on to attend the Royal School for the Blind. At the age of 16, Haviland's family was able to save up enough money to send her to the Perkins School for the Blind. There was not, however, enough money for anyone to travel with her, so Haviland traveled alone by boat to Boston. She recorded that all of the individuals on the boat, including the captain, looked after her. Even though she was ill for both the journey and most of her time in Boston, Haviland had a great desire to learn English. Though Haviland returned to Norway after her studies at the Perkins School for the Blind had finished, she eventually was able to teach herself English.\n\nHaviland married and had a son, George. In 1952 she, her husband Arne, and her son immigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Aslaug and her son joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Norway, and in 1958 after the death of her husband, she and George immigrated to the United States and traveled to Utah.\n\nHaviland moved to Murray, and over time became known as \"Utah's Helen Keller\". Haviland was a popular speaker in Utah and the west coast, giving both motivational speeches and training on handicaps and rehabilitation. Haviland spoke to the general public at open meetings, but also to professional and government organizations, including both the Governor's Advisory Council for the Visually Handicapped and the Coordinating Council of Organizations and Agencies Serving the Blind at their 1974 conference at Brigham Young University. Haviland was also heavily involved in planning and implementing job training programs for the deaf and blind.\n\nDespite her double handicap, Haviland strove for independence and had a strong desire to learn new things. In 1977 she was given a scholarship to attend a nine-week ceramics class at the Salt Lake Art Center school. The class was designed specifically for the blind, and Haviland was named one of the \"star pupils\".\n\nHaviland's son George would go on to graduate from the University of Utah and serve an LDS mission in Denmark. He worked as an admissions counselor at BYU.\n\nHaviland was made an American citizen in 1964. Though Federal Judge A. Sherman Christensen offered to waive the repetition of the oath of citizenship, Haviland requested to be able to participate in the ceremony. Senator Wallace F. Bennett reported that it was \"one of 1964's most unusual naturalization cases\". An arrangement was made by which as the judge read the oath, a friend of Havilands translated it into sign language and tapped it out into Haviland's palm.\n\nHaviland died in Utah on January 6, 2003, at the age of 89.\n\n"}

His revolt was fueled by grievances stemming from Spanish taxation and abuses, and by his belief in self-government, that the administration and leadership of the Roman Catholic Church and government in the Ilocos be invested in trained Ilocano officials. He met an Itneg woman with the name of Gabriela Cariño. He married her and raised a family in the Ilocos Province.\n\nBorn in Aringay, Pangasinan (an area in present-day Caba or Aringay, La Union), Silang's mother was Ilocano; his father was Pangasinense. Young Diego worked as a messenger for a local Castilian priest in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. Bright, passionate, and fluent in Spanish, he ferried correspondence from the Ilocos to Manila; journeys that gave him his first glimpse of colonial injustice and that planted the seed of rebellion.\n\nSpain allied with France during the Seven Years' War, in opposition to Great Britain. The British in response sought to diminish the Spanish Empire. The seizure of Manila by British naval forces in October 1762, and the subsequent surrender of the Spanish Philippines to Britain during the British occupation of the Philippines, inspired uprisings in the farthest north of Ilocos Norte and Cagayan, where anti-Spanish sentiments festered. Though Silang initially wanted to replace Spanish functionaries in the Ilocos with native-born officials and volunteered to head Ilocano forces against the British, desperate Spanish administrators instead transferred their powers to the Catholic Bishop of Nueva Segovia (Vigan), who rejected Silang's offer. Silang's group attacked the city and imprisoned its priests. He then began an association with the British who appointed him governor of the Ilocos on their behalf and promised him military reinforcement. The British force never materialized.\n\nDiego Silang was killed by one of his friends, a Spanish-Ilocano mestizo named Miguel Vicos, whom church authorities paid to assassinate Silang with the help of Pedro Becbec. He was 32 years old.\n\nAfter Silang's death, his Spanish-Itneg mestiza wife, Gabriela Silang, took command of the revolt and fought courageously. The Spanish sent a strong force against her. She was forced to retreat to Abra. Gabriela led her troops towards Vigan but was driven back. She fled again to Abra, where she was captured. Gabriela and her men were summarily hanged on September 20, 1763; she being hanged the last.\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He played college football at Akron. He was also a member of New York Giants, with whom he became a two-time Super Bowl winner against the New England Patriots twice, as well as, a member of the Carolina Panthers and the Chicago Bears.\n\nHixon was born to an African American father and a German mother. He attended Whitehall-Yearling High School in Whitehall, Ohio and was a letterman in football, basketball, track, and baseball. In basketball, he was named Honorable Mention All-State as a point guard. In track, he cleared 6-5 in the high jump event.\n\nHixon was a high school teammate of NFL defensive back Keiwan Ratliff.\n\nHixon was one of Charlie Frye's passing weapons during his first 3 years at Akron. In the 2005 MAC Championship game, Luke Getsy found Hixon for what would be the game winning 36 yard touchdown pass with 11 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, earning Akron its first MAC Championship in school history.\n\nHixon played 4 games for the Denver Broncos to start the 2007 season then was released in early October. He functioned as the team's starting kick returner. At the start of the second quarter in the first game of the season against the Buffalo Bills, tight end Kevin Everett suffered a serious spinal cord injury while tackling Hixon. Everett had a near-full recovery after a grim prognosis but never played another NFL game.\n\nThe New York Giants quickly signed Hixon and soon he took over the main kickoff returning duties. Domenik had one reception for 5 yards against the Minnesota Vikings on November 25. He made his mark by returning a kickoff 74 yards for a touchdown in the Giants' 2007 regular season finale against the undefeated New England Patriots. Hixon's touchdown put the Giants ahead 14-10 in the 2nd quarter, but the Giants lost 38-35.\n\nAs the main kickoff returner, Hixon returned 10 kickoffs for an average of 25.3 yards during the Giants' run to Super Bowl XLII. His returns provided the Giants with good field position and helped propel their offense into the end zone on several occasions. He recovered a critical fumble late in the 4th quarter of the NFC Championship game on January 20 at frigid Lambeau Field, a game the Giants eventually won in overtime. Hixon also recorded 2 special teams tackles in the 2007 playoffs.\n\nHixon later broke out in the Giants second preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, catching two touchdown passes and then returned an 82-yard kickoff for a touchdown, all in the first quarter.\n\nIn week 5 of the 2008 season, Hixon was forced to start after Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress was suspended for breaking team rules.\n\nHixon would have 4 catches for 102 yards and a touchdown in his first career start. He left the game late in the first half after suffering a concussion.\n\nIn Week 14, Hixon would again be placed in the starting role for the rest of the season, due to the suspension of Burress for conduct detrimental to the team after suffering an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound to his leg.\n\nOn June 16, 2010, Hixon suffered a torn ACL at a practice at the Giants' new home in the New Meadowlands, and was pronounced out for the season. He was waived/injured and subsequently placed on the injured reserve list on July 17.\n\nOn August 13, 2011, Hixon returned to the team in the New York Giants and Carolina Panthers preseason game.\n\nOn week 2 of the 2011 Season, Hixon tore his ACL while making a spectacular bobbling catch in the endzone. He was declared out for the season.\n\nIn his career, he's made 31 special teams tackles, caught 63 passes for 838 yards (13.3 avg) and 4 touchdowns, ran 3 times on reverse plays for 18 yards, returned 51 punts for 561 yards and a touchdown and 80 kickoffs for 1,966 yards and a touchdown.\n\nOn March 3, 2012 Hixon re-signed with the New York Giants.\n\nAt the start of free agency, Hixon reportedly turned down an offer from the Detroit Lions. After receiving interest from the Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers, Hixon ultimately agreed to terms on a one-year deal with the Panthers on April 3, 2013. In a week 16 game against the New Orleans Saints, Hixon caught a game winning 14 yard TD pass from Cam Newton to give the Panthers a 17-13 win and give them first place in the NFC South.\n\nOn March 13, 2014, Hixon signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Bears. On May 27, 2014, during the Organized Team Activities (OTA), he suffered a torn ACL for the third time in his career.\n\nOn the same day that his injury during the Bears' OTAs was announced, Hixon announced through his Facebook page that he would be retiring from the NFL. On June 3, 2014, the Bears terminated Hixon's contract with an injury settlement.\n\nHixon hosts the Next Level Football Camp, with co-founder Anthony Jordan, which provides underprivileged children in the Columbus, Ohio area with a summer football training program. In the past, the camp has been staffed by current and former NFL players such as Lance Moore, Chase Blackburn, and Gary Joshua.\n\n"}

He is based in San Diego, California.\n\nLinwood was born July 14, 1956 in Lowell and attended Billerica Memorial High School in Massachusetts before moving to New York City when he was nineteen. He came out as a gay man just before the AIDS epidemic struck. Testing positive for the HIV virus in the early 1980s led him to a life of activism around this condition. Linwood worked in the field of electronic publishing most of his life. He earned dual Bachelor degrees in sociocultural anthropology and philosophy from New York University (NYU) in 1982, then attended the University of Chicago through 1983. He earned dual Masters degrees in Arts and Education from San Francisco State University’s (SFSU) Interdisciplinary Arts Program in 1993. He attended New College School of Law in San Francisco through a state-funded HIV empowerment grant, and became a California attorney in 2002.\n\nLinwood was influenced by the work of Christine Tamblyn, a feminist media artist and critic, who was Linwood’s instructor and mentor at SFSU. Tamblyn studied under Allan Kaprow, the originator of Happenings and Life Art, at the University of California San Diego. Through Tamblyn’s tutelage Linwood learned about the performative aspects of Life Art. In a 1991 interview with her Linwood wrote, “In her role as art instructor, Christine Tamblyn teaches that happenings, process-oriented conceptual art, body art, feminist art, persona art, even documentation art . . . can all be considered ‘Life Art.\" At NYU Linwood was also introduced to works of anthropologist Gregory Bateson which analyzed rituals using cybernetics and systems theory models. These ideas, combined with his practical knowledge of computer programming and design of index and list publications, informed his art practice.\n\nFilm director Dereck Jarman’s movie \"Blue\"\",\" also influenced work that Linwood presented in “Share Your Vision,” for which he won first place and an award. This outreach exhibition was organized to raise awareness about CMV retinitis, a preventable condition that causes blindness in people with compromised immune systems. Organized by Visual AIDS and Roche Pharmaceuticals, the show was presented at Artists Space in New York City in 2003. An homage to Jarman’s film (consisting entirely of a blue lit movie screen with dialog of the artist visiting doctors about his loss of sight) appears in Linwood’s \"Halos,\" which reads as blurred silhouettes like dark pupils immersed in a field of iris blue light.\n\nLinwood developed core graduate curricula in Life Art which he taught at SFSU. These seminars explored conceptual and de-materialized art forms, and ephemera (printed matter, video, digital communication, etc.) generated around performance spectacles, as documentary records, which might then be commodified.\n\nLinwood wrote for \"High Performance Magazine\" in Los Angeles, and the \"Bay Area Reporter\", \"The Sentinel\" and \"PhotoMetro\" in San Francisco from 1990 to 1994. Some of the writers and artists Linwood wrote about include Christine Tamblyn, Nao Bustamante, Sheree Rose, Millie Wilson, Carrie Mae Weems, Diamanda Gallas, The Theory Girls, Jerome Caja, Cliff Hengst, Paul Monette, Sapphire, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Justin Chin, The Hittite Empire, Joe Goode and others.\n\nDescribing the phenomenon of witnessing several prominent Bay Area theorists using body art and other types of performance to demonstrate the gaps between subcultural concerns and dominant cultural assumptions, Linwood coined the term “Stand Up Theory” to highlight how these performance artists highjacked the mic to seduce, ambush, and educate their audiences. Linwood’s sculptural works deploy these strategies. Of \"Initiation,\" a sculpture referencing AIDS and made of honey, Tamblyn wrote, “The piece adroitly expressed the melancholic sensibility that the disease evokes by capitalizing on honey’s association with seduction, entrapment and preservation.”\n\nLinwood is best known for his large-scale photo grids composed of original and found images culled from the environment, the Internet, cult movies and magazine ads. His cross-referencing installations are similarly made up of found and fabricated objects. Both bodies of work share similar characteristics, such as a non-linear viewpoint and an indexical relationship between the images and objects presented, which in turn point to things outside their framing device. His sculptures, \"Initiation,\" and \"Resistance,\" and his projection \"Citizen Pan,\" were displayed in \"A Living Testament of the Blood Fairies\" at Artists Space in New York in 1997, an exhibition that Frank Moore curated around text-based work.\n\nHolland Cotter in the April 1997 \"Art in America\" wrote of the exhibition: “The bittersweet tone was set [by] pieces by Elliott Linwood which opened the show. One was a slide projection of words from Sir J.M. Barrie’s \"Peter Pan:\" ‘When the first baby laughed for the first time, the laugh broke into a thousand pieces and spread over the entire world, and that was the beginning of fairies. But all the fairies are dying now because children know such a lot they don’t believe or laugh anymore.’” Bill Arning, in the December 10, 1996 \"Village Voice\" also wrote about Linwood’s work in the exhibition, “This synthesis of queer politics, camp humour, dark children’s stories, and magic sets us up for a different kind of AIDS show than New York has seen before.”\n\n\n"}

For his personal contribution, Magheru was decorated with the Order of Saint Anne III class — and the golden sable ″For Bravery″ to wear it — by the personal edict of Tsar Nicholas I.\n\nHe was one of the first Pandurs to join the Wallachian uprising of 1821 under the leadership of Tudor Vladimirescu. After the latter's assassination and the rebellion's failure, he returned to life as a local outlaw, only to join the Wallachian Army after a few years.\n\nA competent soldier, Magheru went through several ranks in quick succession; at the same time, his past and career made him an important asset for the young radicals, who quickly won him for their side. He joined the Freemasonry-inspired \"Frăţia\" (\"Brotherhood\") secret society, founded in 1834 by Bălcescu, Christian Tell, and Ion Ghica, one which aimed to counter the arbitrary rule of Alexandru Ghica, and then plotting against Gheorghe Bibescu.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the 1848 Wallachian Revolution, Magheru served in the Provisional government formed by the radicals.\n\nHe is noted for organizing the revolutionary and Pandur army camp in Râureni—on the grounds belonging to the Schitu Troianu Monastery, at the time near Râmnicu Vâlcea (and now part of the city).\n\nMagheru intended to use the army camp as a base for opposing threats to the Revolution, as early as the summer of that year. However, when the Ottoman troops swept into Bucharest in September, he ordered his troops to disband. In this, he probably followed the advice of the United Kingdom consul in the Wallachian capital. The pro-Ottoman attitude remained prevalent among revolutionaries: they had been well received by the Turks, who saw them as a means to oppose the overwhelming Russian influence over the Danubian Principalities, and were probably right in seeing the Turkish move as prompted exclusively by Russian requests (with Abd-ul-Mejid I careful not to leave the countries opened to the full force of Russian repression, which soon joined the Turkish armies in the occupation). This created the paradox of Russia enforcing conservative policies in Wallachia and Moldavia, while most revolutionaries were taking refuge in Istanbul. Magheru was very likely aware of such nuances, and he probably thought it best not to provoke a violent response.\n\nIn exile in Paris (mainly), Magheru was involved in many activities of the Wallachian émigrés. He expressed his concern that the Transylvanian Revolution of Romanian Austrian subjects, aimed at the separatist Hungarian government, was likely to provoke the Romanian fighters under Avram Iancu to side with a Russian intervention, thus making it impossible for Wallachia to negotiate or fight its way out of the occupation.\n\nHe approached the Hungarian leader Lajos Kossuth in January 1849, with a project that would have replaced the tight centralization with a confederation between Hungary and a more Romanian than not Transylvania.\n\nThe project was ignored by both sides: the Transylvanian Romanians thought of themselves as loyal subjects of the Habsburg Crown, and had already suffered waves of violence after Józef Bem's armies marched into the region (in the very same project, Magheru asked that Kossuth renounce the politics of repression and revolutionary terror).\n\nMagheru returned to Wallachia and was active in \"Partida Naţională\", the movement working for the Union of Moldavia and Wallachia (it was largely composed of former 1848-activists in the two countries). Their political ideal was fulfilled on 24 January 1859, when the already Prince of Moldavia Alexandru Ioan Cuza was elected in Bucharest.\n\nOne of the main arteries in Bucharest bears Magheru's name (\"see Bulevardul Magheru\"), and the campsite in Râureni is now a museum. He is honored on a postage stamp issued by the Romanian Postal Service.\n\n"}

From 1810 or so, Ward started to paint horses within landscapes; slightly later, he turned to very large-scale landscapes, of which \"Gordale Scar\" (Tate, London), completed in 1814 or 1815 and depicting Gordale Scar (Yorkshire) as an example of the sublime, is considered his masterpiece and a masterpiece of English Romantic painting.\nWard devoted much of the period 1815-21 to the painting of a gigantic work titled \"Allegory of Waterloo\" (now lost); this neither was much praised nor brought in the revenue Ward had hoped for. The experience may have embittered him, and the deaths of his first wife and a daughter were among other tragedies. Like many artists of the time, Ward sought commissions from wealthy gentry of their favorite horses, their favorite hunting dogs or their children.\n\nOne such family that Ward painted and drew repeatedly, and whom he counted among his friends, were the Levett family of Wynchnor Park, Staffordshire. One of Ward's best-known portraits was his \"Theophilus Levett hunting at Wychnor, Staffordshire\" of 1817. Another was Ward's 1811 painting entitled \"The Reverend Thomas Levett and his favourite dogs, cock-shooting\".\nWard also painted a group portrait of three Levett children — John, Theophilus and Frances Levett. (For the Levetts, see link to the Ward exhibit at the Yale Center for British Art.)\n\nJames was the son of James and Rachael Ward. He was first married to Mary Ann Ward (no known relation) in 1794 and after her death to Charlotte Fritche in 1827 (supposedly a relative of his first wife).\nJames and Mary Ann Ward had several children including:\n\nJames Ward was the paternal grandfather of the painter Henrietta Ward and the great-grandfather of Leslie Ward, the \"Vanity Fair\" caricaturist.\n\nIn 1830, Ward moved to Cheshunt (Hertfordshire) with his second wife, but he continued to work, particularly on religious themes. A stroke in 1855 ended his work, and he died in poverty. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\nJames Ward was one of the outstanding artists of the day, his singular style and great skill set him above most of his contemporaries, markedly influencing the growth of British art. Regarded as one of the great animal painters of his time, James produced history paintings, portraits, landscapes and genre. He started off as an engraver, trained by William, who later engraved much of his work. The partnership of William and James Ward produced the best that English art had to offer, their great technical skill and artistry having led to images that reflect the grace and charm of the era. He was admitted for membership into the Royal Academy in 1811.\n\nOne of Ward's best-known paintings,\"The Deer Stealer\", was commissioned in 1823 for the sum of 500 guineas by Ward's patron Theophilus Levett. When the work was finished, Levett pronounced himself delighted with the results, and consequently raised the remuneration to 600 guineas. Subsequently, Ward was said to have been offered 1,000 guineas for the painting by 'a nobleman,' which he declined. The painting now hangs at Tate in London.\n\n\n\n"}

Lai Châu Province is the most sparsely populated in Vietnam, and it shares a border with China. It was once a semi-independent White Tai confederation known as Sip Song Chau Tai, but was absorbed by France into French Indochina in the 1880s and subsequently became part of Vietnam following Vietnamese independence in 1954. It became part of the Northwest Autonomous Area of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from 1955 to 1975, when Lai Châu Province was formed. Điện Biên Province was carved out of Lai Châu in 2004.\n\n\"Sip Song Chau Tai\" is a Tai Lü compound consisting of \"sibsong\" \"twelve\" and \"chu\" \"master\". It is cognate to , and may rendered in English as \"Twelve Tai Kingdoms\" or \"Chiefdoms\", according to relative standing in the Southeast Asian mandala political model, in allusion to either a Chief of the Name or a tribal chief. \"Sibsong\" derives from Chinese 十 (ten) and 雙 (pair). \"Chu\", (rendered in Tai as จุ or in longer form เจ้า,) derives from Middle Chinese 主 (ćǘ) \"master.\"\n\nLai Châu is subdivided into eight district-level sub-divisions:\n\nThey are further subdivided into seven commune-level towns (or townlets), 96 communes, and five wards.\n\nLanguages spoken in Lai Châu Province include the following.\n\nLai Châu has long been the poorest province in Vietnam. It is also the least industrialised province. In 1974, the industrial output of Hanoi - the richest province in North Vietnam at that time - was 47 times as high as that of Lai Châu. The province became even more backward after the more industrialised south was separated to become Điện Biên Province. In 2007, Hanoi's industrial output (before its merger with Hà Tây Province) was 93 times that of Lai Châu. Industrial output has, however, grown rapidly in recent years, more than tripling between 2000 and 2007, making the fastest growing sector in the province compared to an agriculture and forestry sector that has grown by less than 50% and a service sector that has more than doubled in the same time. Industrial products include liquor, bricks, cement and electricity. Industrial output in 2007 was 476.6 billion Vietnamese đồngs, accounting for 28.9% of the province's economy, compared to only 16.5% in 2000.\n\nLai Châu's main agricultural products (in 2007) are rice (99,900t), maize (35,000t), cassava (48,900t) and tea (16,532t). The production of rice and maize tripled since 2000, while the output of cassava and tea has been increasing by around 40% and 120%. Tea from Lai Châu is sold to other provinces in Vietnam and also exported to other countries.\n\nLai Châu has a relatively large forestry sector with an output of 176.3 billion đồngs in 2007. It has, however, been far overtaken by the agricultural, industrial and service sectors and contributed little to recent growth. It has grown by only 1.66% in 2007 and 1.69% in 2006, after declining by almost 19% between 2000 and 2005.\n\nThere are plans to exploit rare-earth elements in Lai Châu.\nVietnam's central government signed an agreement in October 2010 to supply Japan with rare-earth elements in Lai Châu Province. This is part of Japan's efforts to diversify its supply of rare earths and decrease its dependence on imports from China.\n\nLai Châu's economy grew by 14.56% in 2007, 12.3% in 2006 and 50.75% between 2000 and 2005.\n\nNational Road 4 connects Lai Châu to Lào Cai Province, National Road 12 to Điện Biên Province and National Road 32 to Yên Bái Province. There is also a road to Gejiu in China. There is neither an airport nor a railway in the province.\n\nRoad transport has grown rapidly in recent years. Freight traffic increased from 1 million tons.km in 2000 to 21.3 tons.km in 2007, while passenger traffic increased from 4.4 to 16.7 million passenger km.\n\nRoad infrastructure is still not very developed. Only 19.36% of the roads in the province are paved and only 10.53% of respondents to a survey of local businesses think that road quality is good or very good.\n\nAs of 2007, there 22,100 telephone subscribers in Lai Châu, a significant increase from the 14,200 in the previous year. Only 35.59% of the respondents to a survey assessed telecommunications quality as good or very good, the lowest value among all the provinces in Vietnam.\n\n"}

During the revolution, when local figures often gained power in control of small armed forces, Desrances became a local military leader in the mountains surrounding Port-au-Prince and Saint-Marc.\n\nAt the time of the War of Knives, Desrances was loyal to André Rigaud in his battle with Toussaint Louverture, and was one of the few black officers in the predominantly mulatto northern Rigaud-loyal army. After Rigaud's defeat by Louverture, Desrances is referred to as a rebel in Louverture's autobiography. Céligny Ardouin argues that Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines saw Desrances as a growing rival due to his power in the region, and determined to defeat him. Louverture marched on Desrances' forces in November 1802, and they scattered into the local forest.\n\nTwo months later, the French forces arrived under Charles Leclerc and during L'Ouverture's open conflict with the French, Desrances notably changed his loyalty to the French under General Pampile de Lacroix to fight against Dessalines' forces. An enemy of L'Ouverture in both instances, L'Ouverture wrote of him: \"L’Amour Desrances, who had caused all the inhabitants of the Plain of Cul-de-Sac to be assassinated; who urged the laborers to revolt; who pillaged all this part of the island.\" The combined force of French and Desrances' and others' local militias defeated Dessalines army at Port-au-Prince and forced their retreat.\n"}

It consists of a series of stars imbedded in 13 designated blocks worth of sidewalks in Toronto, located in front of Roy Thomson Hall, the Princess of Wales Theatre, and the Royal Alexandra Theatre on King and Simcoe streets. The first group of members was inducted in 1998, and it has since expanded to include the RBC Emerging Artist Music Mentorship Prize competition, which assists emerging Canadian musicians with getting their careers off the ground. \n\nThe Walk of Fame was first conceived in 1996 when Peter Soumalias suggested the idea of a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his idea but he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians. Canada's Walk of Fame runs an annual contest in which Canadians can nominate potential inductees. In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, fax and e-mail. The committee then analyzes the nominees based on the following criteria: the nominee was born in Canada or has spent their formative or creative years in Canada; they have had a minimum of 10 years experience in their field; they have had a national or international impact on Canada’s Cultural heritage. Following the Selection Committee's evaluation, the nominees that meet all of the requirements are forwarded to the board of directors, who then select the inductees.\n\nNew inductees are inducted annually at an unveiling ceremony where their star, a stylized maple leaf, is revealed. The first was held in 1998 and only four of the twelve then-living inductees attended: Karen Kain, Norman Jewison, Barbara Ann Scott and Rich Little. Since 2008, the Walk of Fame also hands out the Cineplex Legends Award, which is posthumously awarded \"to Canadian pioneers in film, music, sport, arts, and innovation.\" In 2010 the Allan Slaight Award was introduced, which recognizes the achievements of young Canadians who have the ability to turn their talent into inspiration. The award is presented annually to a young Canadian who is making a positive impact in the field of music, film, literature, visual or performing arts, sports, innovation or philanthropy. The list of recipients of the Allan Slaight Award include: Nikki Yanofsky in 2010, Drake in 2011, Melanie Fiona in 2012, Carly Rae Jepsen in 2013, The Weeknd in 2014 and Shawn Mendes in 2015.\n\nOf the 168 stars on the walk of fame, 154 are for individuals, including athletes; coaches; actors, directors, writers and producers of movies, television and stage; singers, songwriters and musicians; playwrights; authors; comedians; cartoonists; and supermodels.

Garcia. The program was launched at the time the country was experiencing a shortage of supply on rice and was credited for the launching of the Philippine Green Revolution in 1973 which allowed the country to export rice to other Asian countries.\n\nHowever, the program eventually failed because its credit subsidy component proved unsustainable.

The plan met opposition from MASIPAG, a group of farmers and scientist, saying that revival of the program will bring back issues such as debt, replacement of traditional varieties with newer ones, and the promotion of pesticide use which they say will harm animals, farmers and crops and insisted that only large firms benefited from the program. The Department of Agriculture notes that the old variety used in the Masagana 99 program is already phaseout and the Masagana 99 can use newer varieties of rice and insists that environmentally friendly pesticides will be promoted under the potentially revived Masagana 99.\n"}

His father was a bank clerk in Wates, Mas Martoredjo.\n\nIn Batavia, Musso studied at teacher school. He met Alimin, disciple of G.A.J. Hazeu and D. van Hinloopen Labberton. According to Soemarsono, one of PKI leaders in Madiun affair, Musso continued to Hogere Burger School in 1913. Musso stayed at Tjokroaminoto's boarding house with Alimin and Sukarno. According to Arnold C. Brackman, at the time Musso worked as cashier at Surabaya post office. In Surabaya, Musso also met Henk Sneevliet.\n\nMusso and Alimin had more important task in infiltrating Sarekat Islam than Surjopranoto. They were members of both PKI and SI before they were arrested due to Afdeling B affair. Musso involved in farmer revolt in Cimareme, Garut supported by Sarekat Islam Afdeling B. In the trial, while Alimin confessed the false statement he made to help Tjokroaminoto, Musso didn't do the confession. In the prison, Dutch government handled him poorly. Agus Salim complained to Voolksraad for this treatment. According to McVey, Musso held a grudge to Dutch government after this treatment. After Musso and Alimin were released in 1923, the former was offered to teach Indonesian language with English as language of instruction in Japan by van Hinloopen Labberton. However Japanese government rejected Musso reasoning he didn't have sufficient academic diploma, though McVey assumed the main reasons were his experience in prison and his political view. Musso then reorganize Batavia PKI branch and led the new one.\n\nIn January 1925, committee of Indies National Congress conducted a meeting resulting the neutral, Surabaya-based association Indonesian Study Club. There was presence of Musso at the club first convention in February supporting the club agenda and wishing it to be closer to grassroots. Also in early 1925, Musso and Alimin gave speech in a rally organized by VTSP in Banten increasing communism influence there. After the failure of machinists' strike on 5 October, Musso concluded that the strike was too early than expected.\n\nIn December 1925, PKI leaders planned to rebel to the Dutch Indies government. The government knew this and arrested most of the leaders in January 1926. Musso was one of who managed to escape. He along with Budisutjitro and Sugono fled to Singapore meeting PKI agent Subakat and Alimin who previously staying with Tan Malaka in Manila. The five plus Sardjono, Mohammad Sanusi, and Winanta discussed for three days concluding the execution of revolt middle of the year. The meeting also resulted sending Alimin to Manila to request Tan Malaka to support the idea which was rejected. In February, another meeting was held but Alimin didn't mention the rejection by Tan Malaka.\n\nSome times in March 1926, Musso and Alimin went to Moscow via Canton to ask for support from Comintern for a revolt. Knowing the plan from meeting in Singapore remained to be implemented, Tan Malaka arrived in Singapore in June to prevent Musso and Alimin, but he was too late because both of them had already gone to Russia. The plan was if Comintern supported, they instructed PKI in Dutch Indies to refrain of the revolt until aid stuff arrived there then PKI launched full revolt, else if Comintern didn't support, PKI launched guerrilla and terror attacks. Comintern rejected the request reasoned that Dutch Indies government was still too solid. To prevent the revolt idea brought up by Musso and Alimin, Comintern instructed them to stay in Moscow longer studying the Trotskyist deviation. However, in October Musso still managed to instruct his people in Dutch Indies to do revolt.\n\nIn 1927, Musso and Alimin went to Russia and studied at Lenin school for several years.\n\nIn July 1928, Musso under the name Manavar along with Alimin, Semaoen, Darsono, and Tadjudin attended the Sixth Congress of Comintern led by Stalin. He expressed his opinion about the failure of the revolt in Jawa and Sumatra the year before. After the congress, Musso served as member of executive committee of Comintern. Musso also continued his study at Lenin University in Moscow but he didn't finish it.\n\nMusso married a Russian woman in 1929 and became father of two children.\n\nIn April 1935, Musso went to Surabaya meeting Siti Larang Djojopanatas, wife of Musso's old friend Sosrokardono to request residence for several months. Musso was sent there to consolidate the old PKI that crushed in 1927. Musso explained Dimitrov line, a new Communist tactical approach, in several newspaper, including three times in\"Indonesia Berdjoeang\". Focusing in Surabaya and Solo, in this consolidation, Musso managed to persuade Pamudji, Azis, Sukajat, Djoko Soedjono, Amir Sjarifudin, and Tan Ling Djie to join PKI. Musso instructed the new members to infiltrate and join the nationalist organizations. The Dutch Indies government discovered this and exiled the members to Boven Digul. However Musso went back to Moscow before the government arrested and exiled him.\n\nArticle written in \"Bintang Merah\" stated that Musso went to Prague in early November 1947 helping Soeripno that represented Indonesia to discuss consular agreement with USSR. However, Soeripno himself claimed that Musso went there in March 1948. In January 1948 after the signing of Renville Agreement, Musso defended his comrades in Indonesia from criticism by Moscow, especially Amir Sjarifudin, stating that it was \"just a tactic, in order not to draw attention of anti-communist faction.\" After the talks in Prague finished on the third week of May that concluded the establishment of diplomatic relations between USSR and Indonesia, Musso, under the name Soeparto, and Soeripno returned to Indonesia on 21 June 1948. They dropped in New Delhi and stayed for half a month or three weeks waiting Indonesian Air Force finished the transaction of aircraft. They join the flight of a newly bought aircraft to Indonesia, stopped by in Thailand then stayed in Bukittinggi for eight days.\n\nMusso planned a Communist revolution idea, consistent with Soviet policy, named \"A New Road for the Indonesian Republic\" whether in Prague or on the way home. During in Prague, Musso discussed with Soeripno and Paul de Groot, a Dutch communist, about Netherlands-Indonesia relation whether Indonesia became Netherlands' commonwealth or fully independent. The plan, according to Ann Swift, was doubtlessly instructed by Moscow, though Musso himself denied this. According former Armed Force Chief of Staff Himawan Soetanto, the idea was influenced by \"Zhdanov line\". The idea was named New Road because it was different from old PKI which was influenced by Dimitrov line.\n\nMusso and Soeripno landed in a swamp in Tulungagung on 10 August. After picked up, they moved to Solo to meet the military governor Wikana. They arrived in Yogyakarta on 11 August 1948. On 12 August, \"Merdeka\", a newspaper based in Solo, wrote that \"there was a possibility that Musso the veteran leader that was very popular had returned\". Later on 13 August, he met Sukarno to discuss about revolution. During a meeting of Politbiro PKI on 13–14 August, Musso presented the New Road. He criticized the Indonesian revolution as bourgeois revolution, not proletariat. He also demanded more labor representatives in government and armed force. Musso also criticized PKI movement while he was not there: use of funds from van der Plas 25000 gulden by Amir Sjarifudin to fight Japanese army, the resignation of Amir as prime minister without consulting to the party, leader of illegal PKI didn't hasten the formation of legal party after independence, and complexity of the communist organizations which divided into PKI, Pesindo, and SOBSI.\n\nMusso then through Politbiro announced to merge PKI that had a poor leadership with Pesindo and SOBSI which was under Front Demokrasi Rakyat on 21 August and turned PKI as a mass based party, though the idea of merger was rejected by Asrarudin and SK Trimurti. Other cadres that refused to merge under PKI were from Pesindo and Barisan Tani Indonesia which was inclined to Sjahrir and from Murba and Angkatan Komunis Muda (Akoma) which was inclined to Tan Malaka. The merger was officially conducted on 27 August.\n\nOn 28 August, Musso discussed with Ibnu Parna from Gerakan Revolusi Rakjat (GRR) and Akoma leaders for a possibility both organizations merged with PKI. However, after PKI published its reorganization on 31 August, GRR criticized Musso and PKI.\n\nIn early September, leftist parties were merged to PKI. After the reorganization, the new Politbiro was created on 1 September. The new members were younger and more amenable of Musso's idea including D.N. Aidit, M.H. Lukman, Njoto, and Sudisman.\n\nTo publicize PKI's new course and gain more support, Musso conducted speeches and mass meetings. On 3 September Musso met Barisan Tani Indonesia, while on the 5th Musso met with students. Started on 7 September, Musso, Wikana, Setiadjit, and Amir Sjarifudin attended mass meetings in Central and East Java, beginning in Solo, Madiun the day after, Kediri on the 11th, Jombang and Bojonegoro on the 13th and 14th, and Cepu and Purwodadi on the 16th and 17th.\n\nIn the middle of the month, an incident between PKI influenced armed force and government loyalist armed force occurred in Solo. After this incident, according to \"Bintang Merah\", on 16 September in Cepu, Musso ordered his men in Solo to prevent the incident to spread. On 18 September, the crossfire broke up in Madiun. PKI sympathizer stated that the new government called National Front was formed after killing government loyalist officers and taking strategic places over. Hearing this, Musso, Amir, and the others went to Madiun to control the rebellion. According to the PKI-influenced militia leader Soemarsono, his action was approved by Musso when Soemarsono visited Musso and Amir two days before. However, according to Ann Swift and Himawan Soetanto, Musso didn't know about this.\n\nOn the evening of 19 September, Sukarno ordered his people to choose himself and Hatta over Musso. According to M.C. Ricklefs, Musso had no experience in Indonesia so he had no power over majority of Indonesian people compared to Sukarno, even local militias that influenced by anti-government side didn't support Musso. Responding this, Musso formed Front Nasional Daerah Madiun, appointed Soemarsono as military governor and Djoko Soedjono as militia commander. Hatta was dissatisfied with the response, and stated that Musso wanted to take over the government and \"establish Soviet government.\"\n\nThe rebels were pushed after Siliwangi Division was ordered to attack PKI force in Madiun. Musso and Amir knew that they couldn't resist Subroto-led attack instructed PKI force to escaped to and hid in hills. On 28 September, Musso, Amir, and Soemarsono left Madiun to Ngebel and Dungus, Ponorogo. When in Balong, Ponorogo, Musso and Amir had a disagreement. Musso wanted to move to south while Amir preferred north.\n\nOn 31 October, in mountain in Ponorogo, Musso was killed by government force in an assault while trying to escape.\n\nMusso was a Stalinist that thought there can only be one party for the proletarian. After returning from Moscow, Musso created idea \"Jalan Baru untuk Republik Indonesia\" (\"The New Road for Indonesian Republik\") which changed the direction of PKI from Dimitrov to Zhdanov. The next PKI leader after Madiun affair, Alimin, disagreed the idea and offered the idea that PKI as little party but has militant cadres throughout Indonesia. However, young cadres in Alimin era such as Njoto, Aidit, and M.H. Lukman were influenced by Musso.\n\nSukarno described Musso as \"jago\", a rooster pet for fighting because when Sukarno and Musso lived together in Tjokroaminoto's house, Musso \"liked to fight\". Ruth T. McVey paired Musso with Alimin as the leaders of revival of PKI in 1920s. Soe Hok Gie described Musso similar to Haji Misbach who \"liked to run amok\" and rather reckless.\n\nMusso Statue will be built in a park in Phnom Penh as a tribute to Musso who visited Phnom Penh in 1931.\n\n"}

{"id": "37365927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37365927", "title": "Peter Joseph Bis", "text": "Peter Joseph Bis\n\nPeter Joseph Bis (c. 1951 - August 16, 2012) was a homeless man in Washington, D.C., known by the Capitol Hill community for his social personality and keen, savant-like memory. His usual daytime location was the corner of Second Street and Massachusetts Avenue Northeast, sitting on a crate under a tree outside an Exxon station by Union Station. According to his brother, James Bis, Bis suffered from schizophrenia. He would greet and converse with passers-by, often offering repetitive, random advice such as “No skinny dipping!” or pointing out the number of days until the weekend. He never drank alcohol or used drugs, but did use cigarettes and drink coffee. He took pride in his neighborhood, spent his days saying hello to the regulars who passed him on the sidewalk, and was provided with food and clothes by the local community. He was even given an apartment at one point, but was eventually evicted because his hoarding tendencies filled up his residence. He would usually sleep in the garage of the Exxon station, and the Exxon workers would let him use a computer in the office.\n\nLittle is known about Bis’s childhood or pre-college years. He grew up in Kalamazoo near Western Michigan University, the son of two teachers. According to his younger brother James, Peter Bis attended Monsignor John R. Hackett High School graduating class of 1969, graduated from Western Michigan University in 1974 with a bachelor’s degree in history. He went to Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan for a year, then worked as a hotel night clerk, then started a car-painting company. He was unable to stick with these plans, however, and eventually started wandering the country as a result of his developing schizophrenia.\n\nJames Bis reported that the illness appeared in Peter Bis’s adult years, as the latter frequently started wearing a lead-lined baseball cap with red lights. The schizophrenia was eventually diagnosed, and his family petitioned that he be committed for treatment, but after only a few months of in-patient treatment, Bis began wandering the country. Though he was never known to have purposefully hitchhiked, he would accept rides from drivers. James Bis described his brother as “a harmless kind of schizophrenic” who avoided getting help for his illness.\nBis’s schizophrenia often made it difficult for listeners to figure out what was accurate in his stories of his past. He claimed that he had received the equivalent of five or six doctorates, that he had studied in the Vatican, that he had been married and divorced, and that he once had a job as a cab driver in Michigan. While most of his claims were ungrounded, these claims endeared Bis to the community, since they could never fully figure out his true background.\n\nThe people of the local community frequently knew him for his keen memory. After his death, personal blogs and D.C. newspapers alike produced articles in memory of him, specifically mentioning his uncanny memory. Washington, D.C. journalist and professor, Terry Mattingly, an Orthodox Christian, referenced a conversation with Bis in which Bis wished him a happy Easter. After Mattingly had gone a few steps, Bis stopped him and recalled that Orthodox Easter was not until a week later. “He was right, of course. Had I shared that personal detail with him or did he glean that tidbit of liturgical minutia from one of the newspapers he read, day after day? Anyone who knew him could describe similar mysterious encounters,” wrote Mattingly in his column for Scripps Howard News Service.\n\nBesides his sharp memory, Bis was known by the community for his conspiracy theories, which he delved into on his personal blog, which according to the title, focused on “Vatican, Finances, Mafia, Kalamazoo.” The blog was written in third person and was one long post, which Bis added to routinely. The blog may have actually been written for him by another person, according to one source, but the identity of the person is unknown, apart from a theory that the blog’s dictation “to a friend” may have been the blog’s scribe. Bis reportedly believed he was an alien, and was especially known for his claim that he was Princess Diana’s ex-lover, and that the Central Intelligence Agency was responsible for her death. He preferred not to refer to himself as homeless, preferring the term “political refugee.”\n\nNumerous bloggers and Capitol Hill voices have referenced him as being extremely influential on the local community. After a period of time living by the United Nations building in New York City, Bis moved to Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. He stationed himself outside the Exxon station next to Union Station in D.C., particularly under the tree in front of the station. He usually sat on a crate under the tree, where he would greet passers-by every day. He would use the restrooms at the Exxon station, and help to keep it clean; he would only sleep inside the garage on especially cold nights—other than that, he insisted on sleeping outside.\n\nSince he usually kept his belongings under his tree, the D.C. local city government once threatened to remove his belongings. Betsy Woodruff of National Review Online reports that 24 of his acquaintances—including lobbyists and hill staffers—signed a petition against the removal of his possessions. Woodruff herself was acquainted with Bis from her time as an intern for the Heritage Foundation, which was right next to Bis’s Exxon station. She said that upon introducing a friend of hers to Bis one day, he proceeded to take them into the Exxon to watch YouTube videos, smoke, and weep over the death of his ex-girlfriend Princess Diana. “So he probably didn’t date Lady Di,” wrote Woodruff. “But I’ve never heard anyone talk about a significant other with as much passion and kindness as Pete.”\nA 2006 post from The World According to Marc blog reported meeting Bis while Bis happened to be sitting on a bench near Union Station and three United States Senate buildings. The blogger, Marc, included a picture of Bis and shared the story of how Bis would never ask for money, but seemed particularly interested in the people he would meet. The blogger also mentioned that Bis had given him a business card and told him to follow his own—Bis’s—blog, which featured a lengthy, convoluted path of far-reaching conspiracy theories. Marc said that after initially meeting, he would make a point to walk to work early so that he could sit and chat with Bis for a bit.\n\nSimilarly, Josie of TellMeAStoryJosie blog reported having had a number of personal interactions with Bis. She reported his common “Three more days ‘til the weekend!” greeting, and his just as common, unrelated “No skinny dipping!” advice. “Pete was as much a part of the landscape of our life here on the Hill as the Capitol dome in the distance,” she wrote in her post about him, following the news of his death.\n\nBis was a popular individual for many D.C. interns, including the interns for Talk Radio News, two of whom performed an interview with him in 2008. This also included interns from the Washington Journalism Center, one of whom blogged about him on the program’s blog, also in 2008.\n\nHis death on August 16, 2012 was initially reported by the Running For 28 Years blog by bloggers from the local D.C. area. The blogger reported that he awoke to flashing blue and red lights around 1:30 a.m. outside his apartment window, not far from the Exxon station. After walking over to the station, the blogger asked a police officer who confirmed that Bis had been found dead inside the Exxon garage from an apparent heart attack. His body was later cremated and sent to his brother, James Bis.\n\nA neighborhood Catholic church, St. Joseph’s on Capitol Hill, held a memorial Mass for him several weeks later. Terry Mattingly reported that a painting of Bis, titled, “A Contemplation of Justice,” was placed near the entrance of the church. The homilist, Deacon Gary Bockweg, said that over the years many people had suggested opportunities for Bis to get off the streets and into an actual job, including Bockweg’s own suggestion to work as a Wal-Mart greeter. However, Bockweg said that Bis had turned down the offer, saying he was over-qualified to work as a Wal-Mart greeter. Additionally, Bockweg shared information that when he had first seen Bis many years ago, Bis had been in St. Joseph’s and was well-dressed but quiet. As time passed, Bis began to arrive with less propriety, and even began bringing a wheelchair of what could only have been his personal effects. He also grew more talkative, which drew Bockweg to get to know him better.\n\n“The last thing people do today when talking to a stranger is call them by name,” said Bockweg. “That’s how Pete connected. … He called us by name and that slowed us down. That made Pete real to us.”\n"}

He was considered a liberal – at least in comparison to others in the ruling National Party and among the Afrikaner community – but the bulk of his career was spent defending South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation against foreign criticism.\n\nBotha was nicknamed 'Pik' (short for \"pikkewyn\", Afrikaans for 'penguin') because of a perceived likeness to a penguin in his stance, accentuated when he wore a suit. \n\nHe was not related to Prime Minister (later President) P. W. Botha, under whom he served as foreign minister.\n\nBotha was born at Rustenburg in the Transvaal. \nAt the age of four, he was struck by meningitis in Lourenço Marques (modern-day Maputo, Mozambique); he received treatment at a small hospital in Barberton, Transvaal, and his mother vowed that if he survived, he would become a church minister.\n\nBotha attended Paul Kruger Primary School where his father was principal. He excelled in high school, becoming chairman of the debating society, captain of the first rugby team and officer in the school cadets. Botha was also a keen writer of both prose and poetry in Afrikaans, and his writing supplemented his salary in his early years as a diplomat. In his first year studying law at the University of Pretoria, a theologian explained to him that God would not expect him to keep his mother's promise to become a church minister.\n\nBotha began his career in the South African foreign service in 1953, serving in Sweden and West Germany. From 1963 to 1966, he served on the team representing South Africa at the International Court of Justice in The Hague in the matter of \"Ethiopia and Liberia v. South Africa\", over the South African occupation of South-West Africa (now Namibia).\n\nIn 1966, Botha was appointed legal adviser at the Department of Foreign Affairs, in which capacity he served on the delegation representing South Africa at the United Nations from 1967 to 1977. In 1974, he was appointed South Africa's permanent representative to the United Nations and presented his credentials to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim on 15 October 1974; in November of that year, however, South Africa was suspended from membership of the General Assembly and, over the ensuing years, the country was excluded from official participation in virtually all of the UN's organs and agencies.\n\nIn the elections of 1970 and 1974, Botha was elected to the House of Assembly as MP for Wonderboom in the Transvaal. In 1975, he was appointed South Africa's Ambassador to the United States, in addition to his UN post. In 1977, he re-entered Parliament as MP for Westdene, and was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs by Prime Minister B. J. Vorster. He continued to represent Westdene for the remainder of his political career.\n\nBotha entered the contest to be the leader of the National Party in 1978. He was allegedly considered Vorster's favourite and received superior public support among whites (\"We want Pik!\") but withdrew after criticism concerning his young age, lack of experience (having spent 16 months as foreign minister) and alleged liberal beliefs as opposed to the ultra-conservative NP machinery (in which he lacked a significant position), instead throwing his support behind P. W. Botha, who was ultimately elected.\n\nIn 1985, Pik Botha helped to draft a speech that would have announced common decision-making on all levels in a single constitutional unit and a formula for bringing about the release of Nelson Mandela, but this draft was rejected by P. W. Botha. \n\nThe next year, he stated publicly (during a press conference in Parliament, asked by German journalist Thomas Knemeyer) that it would be possible for South Africa to be ruled by a black president provided that there were guarantees for minority rights, but was quickly forced to acknowledge that this position did not reflect government policy. Botha recalled in 2011 that he had been \"severely reprimanded and almost fired\" over his remarks.\n\nThroughout 1988 Pik Botha was instrumental in lengthy peace talks between South Africa, Cuba, and the People's Republic of Angola aimed at ending the South African Border War. In December of that year Botha and Defence Minister Magnus Malan ratified the Brazzaville Protocol, which led to the effective cessation of hostilities in that conflict.\n\nOn 22 December 1988, Pik Botha signed the tripartite agreement involving Angola, Cuba and South Africa at United Nations headquarters in New York City which led to the implementation of Security Council Resolution 435, and to South Africa's granting of independence to Namibia.\n\nOn 21 December 1988, Botha, with a 22-strong South African delegation from Johannesburg, was initially booked to travel to the Namibian independence ratification ceremony in New York on Pan Am Flight 103 from London. Instead, the booking was cancelled as he and six delegates took an earlier flight, thereby avoiding the fatal PA103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n\nBotha subsequently served as Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs in South Africa's first post-apartheid government from 1994 to 1996 under President Nelson Mandela. Botha had first met Mandela in May 1990 at the historic Groote Schuur Minute, and was highly impressed by Mandela's knowledge of Afrikaner history. \n\nBotha became deputy leader of the National Party in the Transvaal from 1987 to 1996. He retired from politics in 1996 when F. W. de Klerk withdrew the National Party from the government of national unity. \n\nIn 2000, Botha declared his support for President Thabo Mbeki. Botha expressed criticism for the government's affirmative action policies saying that the South African government of 1994 would never have reached a constitutional settlement with the ANC had it insisted on its current affirmative action programme. \n\nIn an interview on affirmative action, Botha publicly declared that he had never been a member of the ANC, and would not join under its current policies.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, Botha appeared on the BBC's \"Question Time\", hosted in Johannesburg, discussing the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela.\n\nBotha married Helena Bosman in 1953, with whom he had two sons, the rock musician Piet Botha and the economist Roelof Botha, and two daughters, Anna Hertzog and the artist Lien Botha. Among Botha's eight granchildren is grandson Roelof Botha, former CFO of PayPal. Helena died in 1996, after having been ill, including being partially paralysed, following a fall in her home in 1991. Two years later, Botha took Ina Joubert, a former journalist with the SABC, as his second wife.\n\nBotha died of natural causes at his home in Pretoria on 12 October 2018 at the age of 86.\n\n"}

The best known poet-diplomats are perhaps Geoffrey Chaucer and Thomas Wyatt; the category also includes recipients of the Nobel Prize in Literature: Ivo Andrić, Gabriela Mistral, Saint-John Perse, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Pablo Neruda, George Seferis, Czesław Miłosz and Octavio Paz. Contemporary poet-diplomats include Abhay K, Indran Amirthanayagam, Kofi Awoonor, Philip McDonagh and Yiorgos Chouliaras.\n\nAbhay Kumar wrote, \"There seems to be a connection between poetry and diplomacy as several diplomats over the ages have excelled in poetry\". He further adds, \"Diplomacy is a complex art that involves the mixing of political acumen, cultural finesse, language abilities and conversation skills to wield the power of persuasion. Diplomacy is generally conducted in short sentences which reveal as much as much they hide. Poetry is no different\". He adds that poetry and diplomacy share a few attributes such as ambiguity and brevity in expressions, a detached handling of the subject matter among others.\n\nAldo Matteucci wrote, \"Many diplomats have used poetry in their diplomatic work: wrapping words in silk is the diplomat’s job. A diplomat may turn a lie into a ‘constructive ambiguity’ – which is a way of defining poetry. Some poets have been diplomats – Neruda, Claudel, St. John Perse. It’s an occupational hazard: the stimulating place, the sheltered existence – and the ability to paraphrase the unknowable. Few diplomats will admit to using poetry as a survival strategy\".\n\nKamel S. Abu Jaber wrote,\"The language of diplomacy, often like poetry, has the ability to move people from mood to mood\".\n\nStefano Baldi and Pasquale Baldocci wrote in their book \"Through the Diplomatic Looking Glass\",\"The publication of poetry by diplomats seems more inspired by an inner need to express oneself freely than the wish to share sensations and feelings developed during the career. Only verses with their detachment from reality can present an escape from cold and bureaucratic style often imposed by the profession\".\n\nBrazil bestowed the rank of Ambassador posthumously to its poet-diplomat Vinicius de Moraes recognizing his poetic talent.\n\nRussian diplomats have a curious obsession with poetry. “Poets and diplomats use the same building blocks: the idea and the word,” said Vladimir Kazimirov\n\n“Poetry and diplomacy both rely on the alchemy of paradox. We mix fear and hope, power and weakness, love and hate to find a way out of the impossible,” said Dominique de Villepin, French Foreign Minister and a published poet in July 2002.\n\n\n\n"}

He then went to study law at the University of Copenhagen but also studied history and the fine arts, especially singing. He returned to Iceland in 1840 when he married his first wife, Jórunn Ísleifsdóttir. They lived in Álftanes for several years where Páll started working on his first book, \"Ágrip af merkisatburðum mannkynssögunnar\" [\"A Synopsis of the Significant Events of History\"], which was printed in Viðey in 1844. He had also started work on a history of Iceland but in 1844 his house burnt down and his manuscripts were lost.\n\nPáll now moved to Reykjavík where he was the prime mover in founding \"Reykjavíkurpósturinn\" at a time when no newspaper was being published in Iceland.

They were to work together on establishing Kvennaskólinn, the first girls' school of Iceland.\n\nFrom 1862 to 1885 Páll worked as a lawyer in Reykjavík. In 1868 he started teaching part-time at the Learned School and in 1885 he became a full-time history professor. In the 1860s Páll wrote and published a multi-volume work on world history, \"Fornaldarsagan\" (1864), \"Miðaldarsagan\" (1866), \"Nýja sagan\" (1868). In 1891 his \"Norðurlandasaga\" [\"History of the Nordic Countries\"] was published. He also wrote a number of historical articles in various periodicals. Páll's historical writings were praised for their lively and lucid writing style but criticized for their heavy emphasis on warfare and giving short shrift to cultural history. Páll's memoirs, \"Endurminningar\", were published posthumously in 1912.\n\n"}

{"id": "44136736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44136736", "title": "Research-based design", "text": "Research-based design\n\nThe research-based design process is a research process proposed by Teemu Leinonen inspired by design theories. It is strongly oriented towards the building of prototypes and it emphasizes creative solutions, exploration of various ideas and design concepts, continuous testing and redesign of the design solutions. This method is also influenced by the Scandinavian participatory design approach. Therefore, most of the activities take place in a close dialogue with the community that is expected to use the tools designed.\n\nThe process can be divided into four major phases, although they all happen concurrently and side-by-side. At different times of the research, researchers are asked to put more effort into different phases. The continuous iteration, however, asks researchers to keep all the phases alive all the time: contextual inquiry, participatory design, product design, prototype as hypothesis.\n\nContextual inquiry refers to the exploration of the socio-cultural context of the design. The aim is to understand the environment, situation, and culture where the design takes place. The results of the contextual inquiry are better understanding of the context by recognizing in it possible challenges and design opportunities. In this phase, design researchers use rapid ethnographic methods, such as participatory observation, note-taking, sketching, informal conversations, and interviews. At the same time as the field work, the design researchers are doing a focused review of the literature, benchmarking existing solutions, and analyzing trends in the area in order to develop insights into the design challenges.\n\nThroughout the contextual inquiry design researchers start to develop some preliminary design ideas, which would be validated during the next stage—participatory design—in workshops with different stakeholders. The participatory design sessions tend to take place with small groups of 4 to 6 participants. A common practice is to present the results as scenarios made by the design researchers containing challenges and design opportunities. In the workshop, the participants are invited to come up with design solutions to the challenges and to bring to the discussion new challenges and solutions.\n\nSince one of the main features of the research-based design is its participatory nature, the user's involvement is an integral part of the process. In this regard, participatory design workshops are organized during the different stages in order to validate initial ideas and discuss the prototypes at different stage of development.\n\nThe results of the participatory design are analyzed in a design studio by the design researchers who use the feedback to redefine the design problems and redesign the prototypes. By keeping a distance from the stakeholders, in the product design phase the design researchers will get a chance to analyze the results of the participatory design, categorize them, use specific design language related to implementation of the prototypes, and finally make design decisions.\n\nUltimately, the prototypes are developed to be functional on a level that they can be tested with real people in their everyday situations. The prototypes are still considered to be a hypothesis, prototypes as hypothesis, because they are expected to be part of the solutions for the challenges defined and redefined during the research. It remains to the stakeholders to decide whether they support the assertions made by the design researchers.\n\nResearch-based design is not to be confused with design-based research. In research-based design, which builds on art and design tradition, the focus is on the artifacts, the end-results of the design. The way the artifacts are, the affordances and features they have or do not have, form an important part of the research argumentation. As such, research-based design as a methodological approach includes research, design, and design interventions that are all intertwined.\n"}

He served as Cuba's Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) for nearly 30 years and later served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1992 to 1993. Subsequently, Alarcón was President of the National Assembly of People's Power from 1993 to 2013, and because of this post, was considered the third-most powerful figure in Cuba. He also was a Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba until 2013.\n\nA graduate of the University of Havana with a doctorate in philosophy, he served in various diplomatic posts following the Cuban Revolution. His first post in connection with Cuba's foreign policy was as Head of the Americas Division of Cuba's Foreign Ministry. During his tenure as Permanent Representative to the UN Alarcón held several leading offices, such as Vice President of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n\nAlarcón was born in Havana on 21 May 1937. He entered the University of Havana in 1954 and graduated with a degree as a Doctor of Philosophy and Humanities. Alarcón became active in the Federation of University Students (FEU), serving as the secretary of culture for the FEU from 1955 to 1956. Alarcón would become active in Castro's 26th of July Movement, which was attempting to oust Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, in July 1955. Alarcón assisted in the organization of the student apparatus of the guerrilla organization's youth brigade. Alarcón was elected the FEU's Vice President in 1959, and would serve as the President of the Student Organization from 1961 to 1962. However, unlike the Castros, Alarcón was active in the urban underground resistance, and not the guerilla movement located in the countryside.\n\nIn 1962, the new Castro-led government appointed Alarcón as the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Americas division, where he would begin his diplomatic career. Between 1966 and 1978 he served as Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations, Vice President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, President of the Council of Administration to the United Nations Development Programme, and Vice-President of the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. In 1978 Alarcón was promoted to first vice-minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While serving as Permanent Representative to the UN for a second time, Alarcón was President of the Security Council in February 1990 and July 1991. In 1992 was made Minister of Foreign Affairs, and in February 1993 he became the President of the National Assembly.\n\nAlarcón took over the office of President of the National Assembly of People's Power in 1993 in what Ben Corbett, a historian, considered a \"demotion\" from his earlier post as Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, William E. Ratliff and Roger W. Fontaine, in their book, \"A Strategic Flip-flop in the Caribbean: Lift the Embargo on Cuba\", ranks Alarcón as third-most powerful figure in Cuba.\n\nOne year after taking office, Alarcón travelled to the United States as the head of a five-member delegation to talk about the migration issues between the two countries. In a Government statement, Alarcón was described as the \"best qualified\" to deal with such delicate issues as emigration, and his knowledge of the \"fundamental causes\" to mass emigration from Cuba. Alarcón, along with the Cuba's Government, believes that the United States economic embargo against Cuba is the main blame for the mass emigration from the country. The negotiations were suspended for a while when he abruptly travelled to Cuba to discuss the situation with the Cuban Government. After his abrupt visit to Cuba, he returned to the United States and continued the negotiations. When he returned to the United States, he was more positive in tone, and several Cuban officials told the media that an agreement could be reached. Alarcón was able to reach an agreement with the United States Government on 9 September 1994, and the United States promised to issue at least 20,000 immigrant visas a year for Cuban citizens seeking to leave their homeland.\n\nIn August 2000, Alarcón was involved in a minor dispute with the United States when he was denied a visa to attend an international conference in New York City. Alarcón lived in Manhattan for over twelve years but because of his status as a Cuban government official he is only allowed within a 25-mile radius of the United Nations.\n\nOn 2 December 2003, United States Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security John R. Bolton charged that Cuba, along with Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Libya, were \"rogue states...whose pursuit of weapons of mass destruction makes them hostile to U.S. interests [and who] will learn that their covert programs will not escape either detection or consequences.\" In response, Alarcón called Bolton \"a liar\" and cited US claims pertaining to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in justification of the Iraq War which were later found to be incorrect.\n\nIn 2006, Alarcón stated: \"At some moment, US rhetoric changed to talk of democracy... For me, the starting point is the recognition that democracy should begin with Pericles's definition – that society is for the benefit of the majority – and should not be imposed from outside.\" During Fidel Castro's transfer of presidential duties to his brother Raúl Castro, Alarcón told the foreign media that Fidel would be fit to run for re-election to the assembly in January 2008 parliamentary election. However, in an interview with the CNN, Alarcón said he was unsure if Fidel would accept the post or not. Alarcón, in an interview on the topic on who would succeed Fidel Castro, said; \"All those who have been trying to fool the world and put out the idea that something terrible would happen in Cuba, that people would take to the streets, that there would be great instability, the door slammed on them and they must have very swollen hands now\".\n\nAlarcon was married to Margarita Perea Maza. She died on 9 February 2008.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2109238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2109238", "title": "Rima", "text": "Rima\n\nRima, also known as Rima the Jungle Girl, is the fictional heroine of W. H. Hudson's 1904 novel \"Green Mansions: A Romance of the Tropical Forest\". In it, Rima, a primitive girl of the shrinking rain forest of South America, meets Abel, a political fugitive. A movie of \"Green Mansions\" was made in 1959 starring Audrey Hepburn. In 1974, the character was adapted into the comic book \"Rima the Jungle Girl\", published by DC Comics. Though \"Rima the Jungle Girl\" ceased publication in 1975, the comic book version of Rima appeared in several episodes of Hanna-Barbera's popular Saturday morning cartoon series, \"The All-New Superfriends Hour\", between 1977 and 1980.\nLike her literary cousins Tarzan and Mowgli, Rima sprang from an Edwardian adventure novel; in her case, \"Green Mansions: A Romance of the Tropical Forest\", by W. H. Hudson, published in 1904. Hudson was an Argentine-British naturalist who wrote many classic books about the ecology of South America. Hudson based Rima on a South American legend about a lost tribe of white people who lived in the mountains. The book has a religious tone and Rima's speech is poetic. It is a romantic adventure set in the South American jungle in which a political fugitive named Abel meets Rima, a girl living in the forest. Its theme is the loss of wilderness and the return-to-nature dream, and how unpleasant it would be for a savage to meet modern man (the reverse case is not considered).\n\nActor and director Mel Ferrer adapted \"Green Mansions\" into a 1959 film for MGM Studios, with Audrey Hepburn as Rima. The adaptation deviated far from the novel.\n\nRima starred in a seven-issue comic book series, DC Comics' \"Rima the Jungle Girl\" (May 1974 – May 1975), adapted by an uncredited writer and with artwork by penciler-inker Nestor Redondo and covers by Joe Kubert. DC writer-editor Robert Kanigher is the credited writer from issue #5 on. A variation of the character debuted in a six-issue DC Comics limited series May 2010 to Mar 2011 \"First Wave\", written by Eisner Award–winning writer Brian Azzarello. Rima is here portrayed as a South American native with piercings and tattoos; she does not speak, but instead communicates in bird-like whistles.\nAlthough the DC character is a fully grown and powerful woman with ash blonde hair, the novel's Rima was 17, small (4′ 6″), demure, and dark-haired. Natives avoided her forest, calling her \"the Daughter of the Didi\" (an evil spirit). Rima's only defense was a reputation for magic earned through the display of strange talents such as talking to birds, befriending animals, and plucking poison darts from the air. Although in the original book Rima was burned alive by Indian savages, in the comics she escaped the fire to have further adventures.\n\nThese comic book titles feature the Rima character:\n\nClassics Illustrated published a short adaptation from the novel, with direct quotes. In this adaptation Rima is blond. (Copyright December 1951 Gilberton Company).\n\nTitle character 1974–1975\n\nRima is mentioned, but not seen, in America's Best Comics' \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" vol. 2, #3 (2003), by writer Alan Moore and artists Kevin O'Neill and Ben Dimagmaliw: \"...it is near here that the world-famous 'bird girl' Riolama or Rima was discovered...\"\n\nRima is re-imagined in DC's 2010 title \"First Wave\".\n\nRima the Jungle Girl appeared in three episodes of Hanna-Barbera's \"The All-New Super Friends Hour\" during the 1977–78 season, alongside such mainstays as Aquaman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. In her run with the \"Super Friends\" TV series, she is often known for being one of the new 'affirmative action heroes' during that period. Along with characters Apache Chief, Black Vulcan, and Samurai, Rima is considered a minority character.\n\nShe first appears in \"Fire\" (October 1, 1977). Batman, Robin, and Rima the Jungle Girl contend with a spreading forest fire, and have to search for a pair of escaped prisoners who have stolen a forestry truck filled with dynamite. Rima's main contribution is to call upon a nearby bear to push down some trees for an emergency bridge across a wide gap. Her next appearance is in \"River of Doom\" (November 4, 1977): Wonder Woman and Rima the Jungle Girl search for archaeologists who have accidentally stumbled onto a burial ground of angry natives. The archaeologists are captured and sentenced to death on the River of Doom. The superheroes find the would-be victims by using indigenous animals to scout them out at Rima's command. They later rescue the scientists. Rima's main contribution is summoning crocodiles to attack their pursuers' canoes. Finally, she is featured in \"Return of Atlantis\", from October 25, 1980. Aquaman is captured by Queen Ocina when the lost city of Atlantis rises from the sea. Ocina plans to conquer the world with her female warriors, but Wonder Woman and Rima gather the Amazons of Paradise Island to stop her. Note: In breach of both DC Comics' and the \"Super Friends\" TV show's continuities, this \"Atlantis\" is not the kingdom over which Aquaman reigns.\n\nRima was mentioned in Ray Bradbury's 1950 short story, \"The Veldt\". Rima was also mentioned in \"Watcher in the Shadows\" by Geoffrey Household (1960; reissued 2010) and also in \"Vane Pursuit\" by Charlotte MacLeod (1989).\n\nDornford Yates mentioned her in Chapter I of his 1931 comic-detective novel \"Adele and Co.\", in connection with the Hudson Memorial (see below).\n\nThe Hudson Memorial in London's Hyde Park, created in 1925, has a bas-relief of Rima the Bird Girl sculpted by Jacob Epstein.\n\n"}

He was in command of the first failed efforts to break the siege of Kut in 1916. From a military background, Aylmer was commissioned into the Indian Army, and immediately involved in fierce fighting on the north-west frontier. In a singularly heroic action, still in his twenties, he helped rescue Townshend's garrison at Chitral, spearheading the relief column. For his valorous conduct he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and rapid promotion through the officer class.\n\nBorn the son of Captain Fenton John Aylmer (24 December 1835 – 9 April 1862) and Isabella Eleanor Darling (died 27 December 1908). Aylmer attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a Gentleman Cadet and was promoted Lieutenant on 27 July 1880. He took part in the Burma expedition between 1886 and 1887.\n\nFenton was 29 years old, and a captain in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army and Bengal Sappers & Miners (British Indian Army), during the Hunza–Nagar Campaign, India when he won the Victoria Cross in 1891 for the following deed:\nHe was promoted Major on 18 October 1893 in recognition of his services during the Hunza-Nagar Expedition, and was part of the Chitral Expedition in 1895. Further service with the Royal Engineers saw him promoted a brevet Lieutenant-colonel. In July 1901 he was appointed Assistant Quartermaster general in India, and promoted to the substantive rank of Colonel. Ten years later, in March 1912, having been promoted to major-general, he became Adjutant-General, India.\n\nIn 1913 he married Lady Risley, the widow of Sir Herbert Risley, head of the Indian Civil Service. Born Elsie Julie Oppermann, daughter of Friedrich Oppermann, she was considered a great beauty and had, for many years prior to her marriage to him had an affair with Aylmer—an affair that was well-known within Indian society and apparently tolerated by Sir Herbert. Lady Aylmer died on 18 July 1934.\n\nHaving been promoted to lieutenant general, Aylmer was put in charge of the first effort to end the siege of Kut. General Aylmer was in command of the Tigris Corps, consisting of the 7th (Meerut) Division, the 12th Indian Division, and a number of other smaller military units. All told he had more than 20,000 men. They left Basra in late December 1915 and arrived at Sheikh Sa'ad on 3 January 1916. While the 12th Indian Division (under command of General George Gorringe) made a diversionary move near Nasiriyeh, the 7th (under the command of General Younghusband) staged a direct assault on the Ottoman positions on 6 January (the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad). After two days of fighting, the Ottoman army withdrew. The British sustained approximately 4,000 casualties - much more than the medical units could cope with. The Ottoman troops, under the generalship of Baron von der Goltz only withdrew some six miles up river and occupied another defensive position near the edge of the Suwaikiya Marshes. A British assault on this position on 13 January was partially successful, the position was carried but again with significant losses (some 1,600 casualties) (the Battle of Wadi).\n\nBy now, a third division had been added to Aylmer's Tigris Corps, the 3rd (Lahore) Division. This new division, along with the weakened 7th Division, attacked Ottoman defensive works at Hanna on 21 January (the Battle of Hanna). This assault was a complete failure. The Ottoman troops held their trench lines while some 2,700 British soldiers were killed or wounded.\n\nGeneral Aylmer was reinforced with another division, the 13th (Western) Division. The next month was spent resting the troops and probing the Ottoman defensive positions. With time running out on Major-General Townshend's garrison in Kut, Aylmer finally launched a two pronged attack on the Ottoman positions, one attack at the Sinn Abtar Redoubt, the other attack at the Dujaila Redoubt. The attacks were launched on 7 March 1916. Both attacks failed due to lack of initiative and an inability to coordinate the timing of the assaults: they ended up being sequential, not simultaneous as was intended. The British lost some 4,000 casualties.\n\nFenton Aylmer was replaced by the former commander of the 12th Indian division, Major-General George Gorringe. He did not command in battle again, retiring from the British Army in 1919. However, from 1922 till his death he was the Commandant of the Royal Engineers. Following his death in 1935 he was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium where his ashes remain.\n\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Chatham, Kent, England.\n\n\n"}

Upon his release, he starred in a theater show by that name which was a hit in the 1950s—running more than a thousand times—and which was eventually made into a film version.\n\nBodo performed on the stages of the institutionalized theaters Zira Theatre, Habima Theatre, Haifa Theatre as well as commercial theater, mostly in Yiddish, where he was successful. In 1992, he joined the Yiddish-Shpiel theatre, where he mostly performs in leading roles. Among the more notable plays he performed in were \"Maagal HaGir\" (lit. \"The Chalk Circle\"), and \"Karnafim\" (lit. \"Rhinoceroses\").\n\nIn 1964 he performed in Ephraim Kishon's critically acclaimed film \"Sallah Shabati\" (), alongside notable actors and performers such as Chaim Topol, Gila Almagor, Zaharira Harifai, Shaike Levi, and Arik Einstein. The film was a satirical portrayal of the poor conditions and the integration of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands living in the maabara.\n\nIn 1966, Bodo's character, \"Moishe Ventilator\", was picked up and made into a parody film by the same name (), where, under the direction of Uri Zohar, Bodo, accompanied by Shaike Ophir and the Gashah HaHiver trio, portrayed a frugal private whose cost cutting ideas include cutting on maps in the operation room, which are coveted by a spy who infiltrates the IDF ranks.\n\nIn 1967, he performed in Kishon's film \"Ervinka\" (, Starred by Chaim Topol), about an incorrigible layabout who becomes involved in a robbery of the Israeli lottery under the cover of making a documentary.\n\nBodo has also performed in the films \"The Fox in the Chicken Coop\" (), \"Nahche and The General\" (), \"Millionaire in Trouble\" (), \"Margo Sheli\" (), \"Take When They Give\" (), \"Five Five\" (), \"A Miracle in The Village\" (), \"Just Not on Saturday\" (), \"Not a Word to Morgenstern\" (), and others.\n\nYaakov Bodo has been awarded the 2009 Israeli Theater Award lifetime achievement award, the Edith and Israel Pollack Award for 1999, and the Lerner Yiddish Foundation Award for 2000.\n\nBodo is married with three children and has five grandchildren. He is still married to his wife and personal manager, Ester, whom he met in Afula, the city that his family was sent to soon after they emigrated to Israel in the early 1950s.\n\n"}
