By the age of 15, she had appeared on stage with Shania Twain and by 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records worth more than $2 million.\n\nHer debut studio album, \"Let Go\" (2002), emphasized a skate punk persona in which she has since been often referred by critics and music publications as the \"Pop Punk Queen\", due to her achievement and impact in the industry. Lavigne is considered a key musician in the development of pop punk music, since she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music. Since her professional debut, Lavigne has sold more than 40 million albums and over 50 million singles worldwide, making her the third-best-selling Canadian female artist of all time, behind Celine Dion and Shania Twain.\n\nLavigne's breakthrough single, \"Complicated\", reached number one in several countries worldwide and led to Lavigne becoming the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album in the United Kingdom. Her second studio album, \"Under My Skin\" (2004), became Lavigne's first album to reach the top of the \"Billboard\" 200 chart in the United States, going on to sell 10 million copies worldwide. \"The Best Damn Thing\" (2007), Lavigne's third studio album, reached number one in seven countries worldwide and saw the international success of its lead single \"Girlfriend\", which became her first single to reach the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, \"Goodbye Lullaby\" (2011) and \"Avril Lavigne\" (2013), saw continued commercial success and were both certified gold in Canada, the United States, and other territories.\n\nIn addition to music, Lavigne voiced Heather, a Virginia opossum, in the animated film \"Over the Hedge\" (2006), and made her screen acting debut in \"Fast Food Nation\" (2006). In 2008, Lavigne introduced her clothing line, Abbey Dawn, and in 2009, she released her first perfume, Black Star, which was followed by Forbidden Rose in 2010, and Wild Rose in 2011. Lavigne has been married twice: to Deryck Whibley from 2006 to 2010, and Chad Kroeger from 2013 to 2015.\n\nLavigne was born in 1984 at Belleville, Ontario, Canada. Her mother is of English, Scottish, and German descent, and her father, Jean-Claude Joseph Lavigne, is of French-Canadian origin. She was named \"Avril\" by her father after the French word for the month of April. He and Lavigne's mother, Judith-Rosanne \"Judy\" Lavigne (née Loshaw), recognized their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang \"Jesus Loves Me\" on the way home from church. Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle, both of whom teased her when she sang. \"My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying.\" She is the sister-in-law of Japanese band One OK Rock bassist Ryota Kohama.\n\nWhen Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to Greater Napanee, Ontario, a town with a population of approximately 5,000. In school, she was sometimes kicked out of class for misbehaving. Her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio; following his own love for music Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Center in Kingston, Ontario, where he often played bass. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions. Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks, and Shania Twain. She also began writing her own songs. Her first song was called \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\", about a teenage crush, which she described as \"cheesy cute\".\n\nIn 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with the Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people. Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, \"What Made You Say That\", and Lavigne told Twain that she was going to be \"a famous singer\". During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, \"Touch the Sky\", for his 1999 album, \"Quinte Spirit\". She later sang on \"Temple of Life\" and \"Two Rivers\" for his follow-up album, \"My Window to You\", in 2000.\n\nIn December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing country covers at a Chapters bookstore in Kingston, Ontario. Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives. Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, Nettwerk, received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement. Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer Peter Zizzo during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song \"Why\". Lavigne was noticed by Arista Records during a trip to New York.\n\nIn November 2000, Ken Krongard, an A&R representative, invited Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition \"so impressed\" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25 million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance. By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed skateboarding, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career. Lavigne's band was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the Canadian punk rock scene who would fit with Lavigne's personality.\n\nReid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told HitQuarters that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with The Matrix production team—including \"Complicated\", later released as her debut single—that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording of Lavigne's debut album, \"Let Go\", finished in January 2002.\n\nLavigne released \"Let Go\" in June 2002 in the US, where it reached number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK—this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the UK Albums Chart at that time. By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and \"Let Go\" the top-selling debut of the year. By May 2003, \"Let Go\" had accumulated over 1 million sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association. By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide. By March 2018, the RIAA certified the album seven-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over seven million units in the US.\n\nLavigne's debut single, \"Complicated\", peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the US. \"Complicated\" was one of the bestselling Canadian singles of 2002, and one of the decade's biggest hits in the US, where subsequent singles \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm with You\" reached the top ten. With these three singles, Lavigne became the second artist in history to have three top-ten songs from a debut album on \"Billboard\"s Mainstream Top 40 chart. Lavigne was named Best New Artist (for \"Complicated\") at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, won four Juno Awards in 2003 out of six nominations, received a World Music Award for \"World's Bestselling Canadian Singer\", and was nominated for eight Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for \"Complicated\".\n\nIn 2002, Lavigne made a cameo appearance in the music video for \"Hundred Million\" by the pop punk band Treble Charger. In March 2003, Lavigne posed for the cover of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, and in May she performed \"Fuel\" during MTV's Icon tribute to Metallica. During her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour, Lavigne covered Green Day's \"Basket Case\".\n\nLavigne's second studio album, \"Under My Skin\", was released in May 2004 and debuted at number one in Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the US. The album was certified five-times Platinum in Canada and has sold 10 million copies, including 3.2 million in the US. Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, and Kreviazuk's husband, Our Lady Peace front man Raine Maida, co-produced the album with Butch Walker and Don Gilmore. Lavigne said that \"Under My Skin\" proved her credentials as a songwriter, saying that \"each song comes from a personal experience of mine, and there are so much[sic] emotions in those songs\". \"Don't Tell Me\", the lead single off the album, reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia. \"My Happy Ending\", the album's second single, was a top five hit in the UK and Australia. In the US, it was a top ten entry on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and became a number-one pop radio hit. The third single, \"Nobody's Home\", did not manage to make the top 40 in the US and performed moderately elsewhere.\n\nDuring early 2004 Lavigne went on the 'Live and By Surprise' acoustic mall tour in the US and Canada to promote \"Under My Skin\", accompanied by her guitarist Evan Taubenfeld. In late 2004, Lavigne embarked on her first world tour, the year-long Bonez Tour. Lavigne won two World Music Awards in 2004, for 'World's Best Pop/Rock Artist' and 'World's Bestselling Canadian Artist', and won three Juno Awards from five nominations in 2005, including 'Artist of the Year'. She also won in the category of 'Favorite Female Singer' at the eighteenth annual Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nLavigne co-wrote the song \"Breakaway\", which was recorded by Kelly Clarkson for the soundtrack to the 2004 film \"\". \"Breakaway\" was released as a single in mid 2004 and subsequently included as the title track on Clarkson's second album, \"Breakaway\". Lavigne performed the Goo Goo Dolls song \"Iris\" with the band's lead singer John Rzeznik at Fashion Rocks in September 2004, and she posed for the cover of \"Maxim\" in October 2004. She recorded the theme song for \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\" (released in November 2004) with producer Butch Walker.\n\nIn February 2006, Lavigne represented Canada at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics. Fox Entertainment Group approached Lavigne to write a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 fantasy-adventure film \"Eragon\"; her contribution, \"Keep Holding On\", was released as a single to promote the film and its soundtrack.\nLavigne's third album, \"The Best Damn Thing\", was released in April 2007 and debuted at number one on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200, and subsequently achieved Platinum status in Canada. The album sold more than 2 million copies in the US. Its lead single, \"Girlfriend\", became Lavigne's first number-one single on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and one of the decade's biggest singles. The single also peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and Japan, and reached number two in the UK and France. As well as English, \"Girlfriend\" was recorded in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Japanese, and Mandarin. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked \"Girlfriend\" as the most-downloaded track worldwide in 2007, selling 7.3 million copies, including the versions recorded in eight different languages. \"When You're Gone\", the album's second single, reached the top five in Australia and the United Kingdom, the top ten in Canada, and the top forty in the US. \"Hot\" was the third single and charted only at number 95 in the US, although it reached the top 10 in Canada and the top 20 in Australia.\n\nLavigne won two World Music Awards in 2007, for 'World's Bestselling Canadian Artist' and 'World's Best Pop/Rock Female Artist'. She won her first two MTV Europe Music Awards, received a Teen Choice Award for 'Best Summer Single', and was nominated for five Juno Awards. In December 2007, Lavigne was ranked number eight in \"Forbes\" magazine's list of 'Top 20 Earners Under 25', with annual earnings of $12 million. In March 2008, Lavigne undertook a world tour, The Best Damn World Tour, and appeared on the cover of \"Maxim\" for the second time. In mid-August, Malaysia's Islamic opposition party, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, attempted to ban Lavigne's tour show in Kuala Lumpur, judging her stage moves \"too sexy\". Her concert on August 29 was thought that it would promote wrong values ahead of Malaysia's independence day on August 31. On August 21, 2008, MTV reported that the concert had been approved by the Malaysian government.\n\nIn January 2010, Lavigne worked with Disney clothing designs inspired by Tim Burton's feature film \"Alice in Wonderland\". She recorded a song for its soundtrack, \"Alice\", which was played over the end credits and included on the soundtrack album \"Almost Alice\". In February, Lavigne performed at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony. Lavigne's song \"I'm with You\" was sampled by Rihanna on the track \"Cheers (Drink to That)\", which is featured on Rihanna's fifth studio album, \"Loud\" (2010). \"Cheers (Drink to That)\" was released as a single the following year, and Lavigne appeared in its music video. In December 2010, American singer Miranda Cosgrove released \"Dancing Crazy\", a song written by Lavigne, Max Martin and Shellback. It was also produced by Martin.\n\nLavigne began recording for her fourth studio album, \"Goodbye Lullaby\", in her home studio in November 2008, its opening track, \"Black Star\", was written to help promote her first fragrance of the same name. Lavigne described the album as being about her life experiences rather than focusing on relationships, and its style as less pop rock than her previous material, reflecting her age. The release date for \"Goodbye Lullaby\" was delayed several times, which Lavigne said was because of her label. \"Goodbye Lullaby\" was released in March 2011, and its lead single, \"What the Hell\", premiered in December 2010. \"Goodbye Lullaby\" received Juno Award nominations for Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year. By March 2018, \"Goodbye Lullaby\" sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified one Gold by the RIAA.\n\nThree months after the release of \"Goodbye Lullaby\", Lavigne announced that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, describing it as the musical opposite of \"Goodbye Lullaby\" and \"pop and more fun again\". In late 2011, she confirmed that she had moved to Epic Records, headed by L. A. Reid. Lavigne contributed two cover songs to the 2012 Japanese animated film \"\": \"How You Remind Me\" (originally by Nickelback) and \"Bad Reputation\" (originally by Joan Jett).\n\nThe lead single from Lavigne's fifth studio album, \"Here's to Never Growing Up\" (produced by Martin Johnson of the band Boys Like Girls), was released in April 2013 and reached top 20 positions on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, Australia and the UK. The second single, \"Rock n Roll\", was released in August 2013 and the third, \"Let Me Go\" (featuring Lavigne's then-husband Chad Kroeger of Nickelback), was released in October 2013.\n\nThe album, eponymously titled \"Avril Lavigne\", was released in November 2013; in Canada, it was certified gold and received a Juno Award nomination for Pop Album of the Year. The fourth and last single from \"Avril Lavigne\", \"Hello Kitty\", was released in April 2014. The music video sparked controversies. During mid 2014, Lavigne opened for boy band the Backstreet Boys' In a World Like This Tour and played at the music festival Summer Sonic in Tokyo, Japan. By March 2018, the album sold more than 500,000 copies in the US, and it was certified one Gold by the RIAA.\n\nIn an April 2015 interview with \"Billboard\", Lavigne announced a new single titled \"Fly\", which was released on April 26 in association with the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.\n\nLavigne features in the song \"Listen\" from Japanese rock band One Ok Rock's eighth studio album, \"Ambitions\", released on January 11, 2017. Lavigne also features in the song \"Wings Clipped\" by Grey with Anthony Green for the duo's debut EP \"Chameleon\", released on September 29, 2017.\n\nOn September 19, 2018, Lavigne released \"Head Above Water\" as the lead single from her upcoming sixth studio album of the same name. The album will include the tracks \"Dumb Blonde\", \"Birdie\", \"It Was in Me\", \"Warrior\" and \"I Fell in Love with the Devil\".\n\nLavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video \"Nobody's Home\" involved the most \"acting\". Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\", performing \"Sk8er Boi\" with her band in a nightclub. She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film \"Going the Distance\". The main characters bump into her backstage at the MuchMusic Video Awards after her performance of \"Losing Grip\".\n\nShe moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to New Mexico to film a single scene in the 2007 film, \"The Flock\". She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and Richard Gere. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes. On her role in \"The Flock\", Lavigne said, \"I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast\". \"The Flock\" was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7 million in the foreign box office.\nLavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film \"Over the Hedge\", based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, \"All the actors went in individually, and [director] Tim and [screenwriter Karey] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of.\" Lavigne found the recording process to be \"easy\" and \"natural\", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. \"I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still.\" Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. \"[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude\". The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38 million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336 million worldwide.\n\nIn December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in \"Fast Food Nation\", based on the book \"Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal\". The fictionalized adaptation, directed by Richard Linklater, traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses. Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows. The film opened on November 17, 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2 million worldwide.\n\nBoth \"Over the Hedge\" and \"Fast Food Nation\" opened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the \"right parts and the right movies.\" Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. \"I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part.\" In August 2006, \"Canadian Business\" magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.\n\nIn July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line \"Abbey Dawn\", featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by Kohl's, which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself. Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a \"juniors lifestyle brand\", which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and \"hot pinks and blacks\". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. \"I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all.\" The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, \"after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career\".\n\nThe designs were also featured on the Internet game \"Stardoll\", where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne. On September 14, 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the New York Fashion Week, returning in 2011. In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website. \"It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find.\"\n\nLavigne released her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter & Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on March 7, 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada. When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, \"I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are.\" Black Star won the 2010 Best \"Women's Scent Mass\" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW). Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, \"Forbidden Rose\", which took two years to develop. It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. Its message is an extension of Black Star's \"follow your dreams\", though the tagline for the new perfume is \"Dare to Discover\". The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting, where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose. Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is \"Dare to discover more\". It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crème brûlée.\n\nIn January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate \"Alice in Wonderland\"-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing. Her designs were exhibited at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in California beginning in May through September, alongside Colleen Atwood's costumes from the 2010 film.\n\nThemes in Lavigne's music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her \"songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true.\" On her debut album, \"Let Go\", Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as \"Losing Grip\", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as \"Complicated\", saying that \"the songs I did with the Matrix ... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore.\" Lavigne's second album, \"Under My Skin\", had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that \"I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about ... Like boys, like dating or relationships\". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. In contrast, her third album, \"The Best Damn Thing\", was not personal to her. \"Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through.\" Her objective in writing the album was simply to \"make it fun\". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. \"Goodbye Lullaby\", Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as \"more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional\". Ian McKellen defined her as \"a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian\" on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\" in 2007.\n\nMost critics and publications, such as \"The New York Times\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"NME\", \"MusicMight\", IGN and \"PopMatters\", have identified Lavigne as a mix of alternative rock, pop punk and pop rock, influenced by a post-grunge sound.\n\nWhile Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. She said \"I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me\", adding that she had been writing \"full-structured songs\" since she was 14. Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles \"Complicated\", \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"I'm with You\". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that \"[N]one of those songs aren't from me\".\n\nIn 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk, who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism and criticized her songwriting, saying that \"Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything.\" Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for \"clear defamation\" against her character. Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that \"Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her.\" Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band the Rubinoos, sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\" for her song \"Girlfriend\". Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, \"me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a Sum 41 song. It's the Sex Pistols, not the Rubinoos.\" In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.\n\nLavigne's earlier influences came from country music acts such as Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain; and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia and Janis Joplin. By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk and punk rock acts such as blink-182, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Incubus and the Used; as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, the Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind and Matchbox Twenty.\n\nBecause of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's personal style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, \"It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest\". Lavigne commented on the matter: \"I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel ... punk, and I am \"so\" not any of them.\" However, she has also said that her music has punk influences: \"I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do.\"\n\nIn 2003, Lavigne won an International Achievement Award for the song \"Complicated\" at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto. Lavigne received eight Grammy Awards nominations in two years, including Best New Artist. She has also received three American Music Awards nominations, one Brit Award nomination, and one MTV Video Music Award. She has received a total of 221 awards and 301 nominations.\n\nBy 2013, Lavigne had sold more than 50 million singles and 40 million copies of her albums worldwide, becoming one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the US, with over 12.4 million copies certified by the RIAA. In 2009, \"Billboard\" named Lavigne the number 10 pop artist in the \"Best of the 2000s\" chart. She was listed as the 28th overall best act of the decade based on album and single chart performance in the US.\n\nLavigne is considered a highlight in the pop-punk and alternative pop-rock scene since she helped to paved the way for the success of female-driven punk-influenced pop music, such as Paramore, Skye Sweetnam, Fefe Dobson, Lillix, Kelly Osbourne, Krystal Meyers, Tonight Alive, Courage My Love and Hey Monday. She has been compared to alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s such as Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair and Courtney Love and earned a reputation as the greatest female representative of pop-punk music, and has been called one of the female singers who best represent 2000s rock music. Lavigne also was seen as a fashion icon for her skatepunk and rocker style. \"Sk8er Boi\", \"He Wasn't\" and \"Girlfriend\" are frequently listed among the best pop-punk songs of all time by critics.\n\nLavigne holds a Guinness World Record as being the youngest female solo artist to top the UK album chart, on January 11, 2003 at the age of 18 years and 106 days. The album \"Let Go\" reached number one in its 18th chart week. She also was the first to reach 100 million views on a YouTube video, with her 2007 single \"Girlfriend\". Lavigne was the first western artist to do a full tour in China, with The Best Damn Tour in 2008; and is considered the biggest western artist in Asia, especially in Japan where her first three albums have sold more than 1 million copies, being the only Female Western Artist since the 2000s to achieve it. Avril Lavigne is the only artist to have performed on three different multi-sport event, such as two closing ceremonies of Winter Olympic Games (Torino 2006 and Vancouver 2010) and in the opening ceremony of the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.\n\nThe singer's influences extend beyond pop rock, pop punk and teen pop to include acts such as Aly & AJ, Busted, Hilary Duff, Rob Halford (Judas Priest), Courage My Love, Ed Sheeran, Miley Cyrus, Vanessa Hudgens, Jessie J, Jonas Brothers, Brie Larson, Lesley Roy, Selena Gomez, Ashley Tisdale, Ariana Grande, Paramore, Amy Studt, Meghan Trainor, Hey Monday, Kelly Osbourne, Amanda Palmer, Misono, YUI, Demi Lovato, Kirstin Maldonado, and PVRIS. Lavigne also has fueled a ferocity influence on indie rock singer-songwriters, such as, Soccer Mommy, Snail Mail and Liz Phair.\n\nOn the rise of mid-to-late 2010s emo hip hop and emo rap, Lavigne have been noted as an influence of various musicians from that scene, like: Lil Uzi Vert, Princess Nokia, Lloyd Banks, Vic Mensa, Nipsey Hussle, John River, Baly Baby, Noname and Rico Nasty. American rapper Fat Tony, explained that Lavigne's traces of influences on hip hop and rap music comes because \"she [Avril] delivered a great visual catchy package [punk music, pop music and skater culture] that describes all of them\". Rico Nasty named one of her alter egos, Trap Lavigne, citing \"She is a perfect representation of being hard and soft [...] she hated the term punk, but she was so punk rock\".\n\nLavigne was featured in the 2003 game \"\" as a non-playable celebrity.\n\nIn mid-2007, Lavigne was featured in a two-volume graphic novel, \"Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Wishes\". She collaborated with artist Camilla d'Errico and writer Joshua Dysart on the manga, which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero, Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, \"I know that many of my fans read manga, and I'm really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy.\" The first volume was released in April 2007, and the second followed in July 2007. The publication \"Young Adult Library Services\" nominated the series for \"Great Graphic Novels for Teens\".\n\nIn September 2011, Lavigne appeared on the Hub Network televised singing competition \"Majors & Minors\" as a guest mentor, alongside other singers including Adam Lambert and Leona Lewis.\n\nLavigne has been involved with many charities, including Make Some Noise, Amnesty International, Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, Special Olympics, Camp Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields, US Campaign for Burma, Make-A-Wish Foundation and War Child. She has also appeared in ALDO ads with YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne took part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of UNICEF on November 28, 2007 at the Bell Centre in Montréal, Québec, Canada. In November 2010, Lavigne attended the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nLavigne worked with Reverb, a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east coast tour. She covered \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" for War Child's \"Peace Songs\" compilation, and she recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" as her contribution to the compilation album \"\". Released on June 12, 2007, the album was produced to benefit Amnesty International's campaign to alleviate the crisis in Darfur.\n\nOn December 5, 2009, Lavigne returned to the stage in Mexico City during the biggest charity event in Latin America, \"Teleton\". She performed acoustic versions of her hits \"Complicated\" and \"Girlfriend\" with Evan Taubenfeld and band member, Jim McGorman. In 2010, Lavigne was one of several artists who contributed their voices to a cover of K'naan's \"Wavin' Flag\" as a benefit single to help raise money for several charity organizations related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\nOn September 14, 2010, Lavigne introduced her charity, \"The Avril Lavigne Foundation\", which aims to help young people with serious illnesses and disabilities and works with leading charitable organizations. The foundation partners with the Easter Seals, Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS, Lavigne has worked with the latter two. Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating, \"I just really wanted to do more\". Lavigne said on the foundation's website, \"I have always looked for ways to give back because I think it's a responsibility we all share\". Philanthropist Trevor Neilson's 12-person firm, Global Philanthropy Group, advises Lavigne with her foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician John Legend.\n\nIn September 2014, she launched a personal fundraising campaign for Special Olympics as part of her birthday celebration. Proceeds from her \"Team Rockstar\" event helped sponsor athletes from around the world competing in the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Los Angeles. According to an \"ABILITY Magazine\" interview with Lavigne, the athletes were the stars of the music video for \"Fly\", which was shot in Canada.\n\nWhen Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her tomboyish style, in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses, wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. During photo shoots, instead of wearing \"glittery get-ups\", she preferred wearing \"old, crumpled T's\". In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the \"pop punk princess\" and the female answer to Blink-182. Press and fans regarded her as the \"anti-Britney\", in part because of her less commercial and \"real\" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. \"I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not.\" By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was \"wearing a costume\". Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career.\n\nLavigne eventually took on a more gothic style as she began her second album, \"Under My Skin\", trading her skating outfits for black tutus and developing an image marked by angst. During \"The Best Damn Thing\" years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits, including \"tight jeans and heels\", and modelled for magazines such as \"Harper's Bazaar\". Lavigne defended her new style: \"I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all ... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on\".\n\nLavigne has been the subject of a conspiracy theory that states that she committed suicide in 2003, and was replaced by a body double who had previously been recruited to distract paparazzi. This originated as a joke on a Brazilian blog, but has since been embraced by some theorists. In an interview with Australia's KIIS 106.5 in November 2018, Lavigne responded to the rumour, dismissing it as weird.\n\nOnly a few of Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her; the rest are matched with those of her friends. Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and musical associate Ben Moody's identical tattoo. In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter \"D\" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley. Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday. In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.\n\nHer love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos of the word \"fuck\" on their ribs. Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for \"Inked\" magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an \"Abbey Dawn\" on her left forearm and an \"XXV\" and star on her right. Although she confirmed the \"fuck\" tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her \"favorite word\") she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot. She added that she eventually wanted to get a \"big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name ... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life.\" In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, \"Brody\", tattooed beneath her right breast. The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.\n\nLavigne has been legally French from birth, because her father is French and France applies jus sanguinis. She applied for her French passport and received it in February 2011. In January 2012, Lavigne's house in Bel-Air, on the market since May 2011, sold, and Lavigne moved to Paris, France, to study the French language. She rented an apartment and attended a Berlitz school. She later held her second wedding in the South of France.\n\nLavigne and Sum 41 lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley began dating when Lavigne was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17. In June 2005, Whibley proposed to her. The couple married on July 15, 2006 in Montecito, California. On October 9, 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, \"I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship.\" The divorce was finalized on November 16, 2010.\n\nLavigne started dating \"The Hills\" star Brody Jenner in February 2010. After almost two years of dating, the couple split in January 2012.\n\nLavigne began dating fellow Canadian rocker Chad Kroeger, frontman of the band Nickelback, in July 2012. The relationship blossomed after they began working together in March 2012 to write and record music for Lavigne's fifth album. Lavigne and Kroeger became engaged in August 2012, after one month of dating. The couple married at the Château de La Napoule, a reconstructed medieval castle on the Mediterranean in the South of France, on July 1, 2013 (which is Canada Day), after a year of being together. They had their honeymoon in Portofino, Italy. On September 2, 2015, Lavigne announced her separation from Kroeger via her official Instagram account.\n\nIn April 2015, she revealed to \"People\" magazine that she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease. In an interview with \"Billboard\" that same month, Lavigne said that she was in the recovery process and that she wanted to increase awareness of the disease.\n\nCurrent members\nFormer members\n\n\nHeadlining tours\nPromotional tours\n\n"}

He practiced homeopathy in London during part of his life, and became a renowned practitioner of mesmerism—the theories first developed by Franz Mesmer involving animal magnetism.\n\nHe was born at Sennevoy-le-Haut, the son of Charles Jean-Baptiste Dupotet, seigneur de La Chapelle et de Sennevoy, and Pierrette Babeau Simone. He was married twice, to Aglaé Saunier in Paris in 1833, and the second time to Marie Isaure Hérault. He died in Paris and is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.\n\nDu Potet was a highly successful mesmerist. Some attributed this to the fact he was missing the thumb on his right hand. His reputation was such, apparently, that a man was convicted of murder and executed based on evidence given by \"one of Du Potet's clairvoyantes\". He operated a free school of magnetism in Paris from 1826 on, and from 1837 to 1845 practised as a homeopathic physician in London, where he successfully treated epileptic girls at the North London Hospital and according to a letter to the editor of \"The Lancet\" his experiments became the talk of the town.\n\nFor du Potet, who was in correspondence with mesmerists worldwide, mesmerism was, not unlike Utopian socialism, an aid in bringing about social transformation, even a revolution. An 1890 article in the English occult magazine \"Lucifer\" praises him as an ardent supporter of mesmerism whose \"powerful voice\" might have stopped the \"travesty\" of hypnotism.\n\nDu Potet also pursued occult applications of mesmerism. Eliphas Levi praised him highly in his \"History of Magic\", and said that magnetism had unlocked for him the secrets of magic. Unlike Levi, he believed that trance enabled contact with the dead and with never incarnated spirits, and his circle believed in remote influence by means of magnetic currents. He was a member of the Theosophical Society; his writings were quoted extensively by Helena Blavatsky, who regarded him as an adept. In \"The Discovery of the Unconscious\", Henri Ellenberger considers him to have \"developed ... delusions of grandeur\".\n\nDu Potet published and edited the \"Journal du magnetisme\" from 1845 to 1861. Books he wrote include \"Introduction to the Study of Animal Magnetism\" (1838) and \"La magie dévoilée et la science occulte\" (1852), a copy of which was owned by Victor Hugo.\n\n\n"}

He was the highest ranking American agent of Coptic descent employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as of 2009, as a Unit Chief in the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division. Prior to holding this position, Youssef coordinated the national counterterrorism investigation into the Islamic Group, the organization responsible for the first World Trade Center bombing.\n\nYoussef was born in Egypt in a Coptic Christian family. He speaks fluent Arabic (the highest ranking FBI official with this skill).\n\nIn 1994, he earned the Intelligence Community’s prestigious and coveted award, the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal, awarded by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The award was for outstanding accomplishments in a terrorism case involving an al-Qaeda-related investigation. \n\nAfter obtaining the DCI award, he was selected by the former FBI Director Louis Freeh to head of the FBI’s overseas office with responsibility for Saudi Arabia and the contiguous Gulf States, including UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, Bahrain and Qatar. The FBI’s internal inspection of that office, conducted in 2000, highly praised Youssef’s performance. Inspection reports are kept confidential within the FBI, and are tasked with identifying problems in various programs. \n\nAccording to an FBI report drafted in 2000, within three months of his arrival in Saudi Arabia Youssef's \"efforts led to the establishment of direct communications with senior officials of the Mabahith [Saudi Arabia's security service] which had previously been unavailable to US Embassy personnel.\" These contacts were crucial in establishing a first-ever meeting between then-FBI director Louis Freeh and Saudi officials.\n\nIn July, 2006 the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility concluded that the FBI illegally retaliated against Youssef because he had allegedly made whistleblower disclosures to the Director of the FBI and a Member of Congress.\n\n"}

The exact dating of his reign is unclear; the sources point at either the second half of the 14th century or the early 16th century.\n\nAccording to the 18th-century chronicle Babad Dalem, Dalem Samprangan succeeded his father Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan who had been established as vassal king by Majapahit after the conquest of Bali in 1343. His residence was Samprangan in the present-day Gianyar regency, to the southeast of the ancient royal seat Bedaulu. The chronicle characterizes him as an incompetent and vain figure. He spent much time on his outward appearance, and let his ministers wait in the council hall for him to show up. This behaviour irritated the grandees of the kingdom. After waiting for hours in vain one morning, one of them, Kubon Klapa, left the palace in anger and looked up Dalem Samprangan's youngest brother Ketut, who was a well-known gambler. He persuaded the prince to take royal titles and offered him his residence in Gelgel, a village in the present-day Klungkung residency, near the south coast. In that way, the Samprangan palace quickly lapsed into obscurity, while Gelgel rose as the political centre of the island under the new king Dalem Ketut. No more is heard in the \"Babad Dalem\" about Samprangan which became a minor village immediately to the east of Gianyar.\n\nA complex of legendary texts called \"Babad Pulasari\" relate the fortunes of Dalem Samprangan's other brother Dalem Tarukan, who had a residence close to modern Ubud. He fell out with his royal brother which resulted in a series of internecine wars on the island. At length, Dalem Tarukan was defeated, and his descendants were demoted from the Ksatria caste. Certain Balinese texts date the defeat of Tarukan in 1502. This is incompatible with the \"Babad Dalem\", which indicates Dalem Samprangan about one generation after the Majapahit conquest of 1343. The historical background of these persons and events is therefore uncertain.\n\nIn the central Balinese temple Pura Besakih, the most important shrine is Pura Padharman Dalem Gelgel, which honours a series of six ancient Balinese kings. After Dewa Tegal Besung (often identified as Dalem Ketut), who is accorded a \"meru\" (tower-like structure) with 11 roofs, Dewa Samprangan follows with a \"meru\" with 9 roofs, in turn followed by Dewa Enggong (Dalem Baturenggong) and three later kings. Dalem Samprangan is also listed as king in the early religious text \"Usana Bali\", as successor of Ken Angrok and predecessor of Dalem Baturenggong. All this complicates the question of his original place in the succession of Balinese rulers.\n\n"}

Sampson was the last native speaker of the Klallam language, as well as the oldest member of the Klallam communities at the time of her death in 2014. She was a member of the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe of Washington.\n\nThe Klallam language is still spoken as a second language by some members of the four indigenous Klallam communities: the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe of Washington's Olympic Peninsula, the Port Gamble Band of S’Klallam Indians of Washington's Kitsap Peninsula,as well as the Beecher Bay Klallam of British Columbia, Canada.\n\nSampson was born Hazel Hall to William Hall and Ida Balch Hall on May 26, 1910, in Jamestown, Washington. She was the granddaughter of Chief James Balch, the founder of Jamestown and the namesake of both the town and the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe of Washington. Her parents taught her the Klallam language as a native speaker, though she later learned English as a second language. Her father, William Hall, founded the first Indian Shaker Church on the Olympic Peninsula in Dungeness, Washington, circa 1910.\n\nIn 1934, Sampson and her husband, Edward C. Sampson Sr., moved from Jamestown to Port Angeles, Washington. There, the Sampsons became one of the thirteen founding families who purchased and owned land on the Lower Elwha Klallam Reservation. She was married to Edward Sampson for 75 years, until his death in 1995. She was also a member of the Jamestown S'Klallam Band, which was established as a separate Klallam political entity during the 1980s. According to Jamestown chairman Ron Allen, Sampson, \"considered herself a S'Klallam first. She associated closely with all three bands\" in Washington state.\n\nHazel Sampson was a key contributor in the work to preserve the Klallam language. Timothy Montler, a professor of linguistics at the University of North Texas, began working on Klallam language preservation beginning in 1990. Montler partnered with Jamie Valadez, a Klallam language teacher at Port Angeles High School and member of the Lower Elwha Klallam, compile Klallam language materials and teaching tools. The two began work to save Klallam from potential extinction.\n\nMontler and Valdez collaborated closely with local native speaking Klallam, including Hazel and Ed Sampson, Adeline Smith and Bea Charles. In 1999, Montler published several guidebooks and lesson plans aimed at teaching Klallam language basics through storytelling. Montler also published the first Klallam dictionary in 2012 through the University of Washington Press. He used terms and definitions contributed by Hazel Sampson, Smith and Charles to compile the dictionary.\n\nHazel Sampson had declined to be named as an official member of Montler and Valadez's project, citing tradition. However, she collaborated closely with her husband and other members. The researchers believed she understood the Klallam language better than her husband and the other members of the project. According to Valadez, \"She said, 'This is Ed's work.' She was very traditional.\" Adeline Smith died in March 2013, leaving Sampson as the last surviving, native speaker of the Klallam language.\n\nHazel Sampson resided in her Port Angeles home until her death in 2014. She died on February 4, 2014, at the age of 103. Her death marked the passing of the last native speaker of Klallam, though some younger members continued to speak it as a second language. According to Klallam cultural teacher Jamie Valadez, \"She was the last one...[Her death] changes the dynamics of everything...They carry so much knowledge of our culture and traditions.\" Sampson was survived by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren; great-great grandchildren and great-great-great grandchildren.\n"}

She is an expert on the intersection of women, economics and public policy. Dr. Hartmann is also a Research Professor at George Washington University and the editor of the \"Journal of Women, Politics & Policy\".\n\nOn August 14, 1945, Hartmann was born to Henry Hartmann and Hedwig (Bercher) Hartmann in Elizabeth, New Jersey. She attended Swarthmore College, where she received a B.A. in economics with honors in 1967. During that same year, she married Frank Blair Cochran, birthed Jessica Lee Cochran then divorced a year later. Hartmann then attended Yale University, where she received a M. Phil. in economics in 1972 and a Ph.D in the subject in 1974. In 1979, she married John Varick Wells and had two daughters—Katherine Lina Hartman Wells and Laura Cameron Hartmann Wells.\n\nHartmann began her career in 1969 as a computer programmer and researcher for the city planning department of New Haven, Connecticut, from 1969 until 1972. After, she became an acting instructor at Yale University for one year. She moved to New York City, where from 1974 to 1976 she was a visiting assistant professor of economics at the New School for Social Research.

Hartmann held an American Statistical Association fellowship at the Census Bureau up until 1987, when she founded the Institute for Women's Policy and Research. She is also the editor of the \"Journal of Women, Politics & Policy\".\n\nBefore finding IWPR, Hartmann did many things. She began her career in 1969 as a computer programmer and researcher for the city planning department of New Haven, Connecticut, from 1969 until 1972. After, she became an acting instructor at Yale University for one year. She moved to New York City, where from 1974 to 1976 she was a visiting assistant professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. Hartmann then took her talents to Washington, D.C., where she worked for two years as a senior research economist at the Office of Research of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and then for eight years as a staff member of the National Academy of Science/National Research Council. Here she worked on many reports listed in the 'Publications' section below. Hartmann held an American Statistical Association fellowship at the Census Bureau up until 1987, when she founded the Institute for Women's Policy and Research (IWPR).\n\nHartmann believes women's part in the economy is split in two halves: work for pay and family care. Women are increasingly getting out of the home and into the marketplace but at the same time are still taking on most of the workload at home. In order to achieve equality for women, Hartmann argues that society needs to improve opportunities in the labor market and also make the ability of women and men to make work and home care more manageable.\n\nHartmann argues women's employment progress has significantly increased over the past five decades. Women have entered occupations, that have historically been closed off to them and are able to contribute to their family income and the economy more than ever before. According to a 2014 report by Women's Policy Research, growth for women's occupations over the past seven years was strongest in professional and business services (42,000 jobs were gained by women). Despite all this, Hartmann still thinks that women's employment has a long way to go—see Social Security and Wage Gap/Discrimination.\n\nSocial Security provides many advantages as well as disadvantages for women, according to Hartmann's studies. In terms of advantages, it covers everyone (including women) that has worked at least ten years at a salary of $4,360 per year. It provides benefits to wives regardless of whether they have worked for pay or not, former wives (who had at least a ten-year marriage) and for widows. Social Security also is adaptive to inflation processes and does not discriminate against lower or higher earning women workers. Hartmann also makes note of disadvantages of the United States' current social security system that are particular to women. In 2013, Social Security cuts (known as Chained CPI) hurt women more than it helps them. Elderly women rely on Social Security for most of their income, because they have less access to other forms of income such as pensions and savings that men have more access too. Besides the recent cuts to benefits, years when women are caregiving are averaged as zeroes, which drag's down a woman's overall average income. Additionally, there are no benefits to caregiving outside of marriage, whereas the married caregiver can received spousal benefits from Social Security.\n\nHartmann advocates greatly for equal opportunity in the labor market. In \"Still A Man's Labor Market: The Long-Term Earnings Gap; Unnecessary Losses\", Hartmann argues that the wage gap has a major influence on many aspects of family life—such as choices, poverty rates, single mother's ability to care for their children and older women's retirement rates. If women's wages were higher, Hartmann concludes that nearly all families with women earners would have a higher standard of living. She attributes the lower average earnings of women not to their preferences for low wage work, but because of the degree of sex segregation. Labor market discrimination leads to lower earnings for women, meaning women cannot pay for child care, which takes them away from their jobs to commit to their children, a commitment that in turn contributes to discrimination against them in the workplace. Hartmann recognizes the gender wage gap across all racial and ethnic groups. According to a 2013 report, women of all racial and ethnic groups earn less than men of the same group, and also earn less than white men. Hispanic workers have lower median weekly earnings than white, black and Asian workers, the lowest of any race/ethnic group reported on. Asian workers have the highest median weekly earnings—primarily because of higher rates of educational attainment for both males and females.\n\nThis concept, created by Hartmann, is grounded in her belief that equal pay for jobs of equal value. \"The general goal of a comparable worth strategy is pay equity—equitable occupational wage rates that are not influenced by the sex, race, or ethnicity of the incumbents.\" (\"Comparable Worth\", 4). She emphasized a certain type of wage discrimination that arises when a firm is substantially segregated by sex and the two groups are not performing the same sort of tasks, but tasks that are of \"comparable worth\" to the employer (Women, Work, and Wages 9). Hartmann's exploration of comparable worth forced her to not only look into the issue of wage gaps between men and women but also the significance of gender bias/sex segregation in employment. She defines sex segregation in the workplace as the concentration of men and women in different jobs that are predominantly of a single sex. Hartmann works towards a goal of complete integration, with different proportions of men and women within every occupation identical to their representation in the labor force as a whole. She points out, however, that due to differences between men and women deeply rooted in certain cultures, this goal may take decades to reach. Therefore, an appropriate policy goal would be to eliminate barriers in the way of women's full exercise of employment rights.\n\nAccording to Hartmann, patriarchy is defined as \"controlling women's access to resources and their sexuality, which in turn, allows men to control women's labor power, both for the purpose of serving men in many personal and sexual ways and for the purpose of rearing children\". Before capitalism, a patriarchal system was established in which men controlled the labor of women and children in the family, and that through this they learned the techniques of hierarchal control. Today, Hartmann argues the labor market perpetuates this hierarchal control. Low wages keep women dependent on men, encouraging them to marry. Married women must perform domestic tasks for their husbands, and thus men benefit—both from earning higher wages and by not having to participate in domestic tasks.\n\nIn 1981, Hartmann wrote the lead article \"The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism\" in the publication \"Women and Revolution\". The article argues that \"the marriage of Marxism and feminism has been like that between husband and wife depicted in English common law; Marxism and feminism are one, and that one is Marxism ... either we need a healthier marriage or we need a divorce\". Hartmann argues that the attempts to integrate Marxism and feminism are not sufficient enough because they don't incorporate the feminist struggle into the larger struggle against capitalism—it places the concerns of class over those of gender. Hartmann believes Marxism provides good analysis but is sex-blind. She says the way that radical feminists describe characteristics of men- competitive, rationalistic, dominating- are much like the characteristics of capitalistic society. Therefore, it is in a capitalist society that it makes sense for people to look down on women as emotional or irrational—looking at them as \"dependent\". Because of this, a feminism analysis is also necessary to describe the relations between men and women. She says that society must use the strengths of both Marxism and feminism to judge capitalism and acknowledge the present situation of women in it.\n\nWomen face a double-bind in many aspects of society, but in particular the economy. A woman is expected to work and provide for her family, while also making sure everything is taken care of in the home. In \"Contemporary Marxist Theory and Practice: A Feminist Critique\", Hartmann along with Ann Markusen argue that in order to overcome the issues feminist economists are working to correct (wage gap, discrimination in the workplace, and social security), the relation of women's reproductive processes to economic production need to be emphasized along with their importance to being a part of the actual work force. Hartmann also says that although a couple's share of work outside of the home has become more equal over the past thirty years, the couple's share of housework has hardly changed. In order to progress in the area of housework, the family needs to be understood not just as a unit of common ancestry but also as a location where conflicts regarding production and redistribution are sorted out. Conflicts of production deal with how housework is distributed, the standards for this, and who will work for wages outside the home. Conflicts of redistribution deal with how the money should be spent and who will decide this.\n\nHartmann has won various awards. In 1994, she won the MacArthur Fellowship Award—a five-year grant from the MacArthur Foundation give to individuals who show exceptional creativity for their research and the prospect for more in the future—for her work on women and economics. She is also the recipient of two honorary degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He also published a genealogy of his family extending back to Thomas Olcott, one of the founders of Hartford, Connecticut, in 1636.\n\nIn 1860 Olcott married Mary Epplee Morgan, daughter of the rector of Trinity parish, New Rochelle, New York. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy.\n\nHe served in the US Army during the American Civil War and afterward was admitted as the Special Commissioner of the War Department in New York. He was later promoted to the rank of colonel and transferred to the Department of the Navy in Washington, DC. He was well respected, and in 1865, following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, assisted in the investigation of the assassination.\n\nIn 1868 he became a lawyer specializing in insurance, revenue, and fraud.\nIn 1874 he became aware of the séances of the Eddy Brothers of Chittenden, Vermont. His interest aroused, Olcott wrote an article for the \"New York Sun\", in which he investigated Eddy Farms. His article was popular enough that other papers, such as the \"New York Daily Graphic\", republished it. His 1874 publication \"People from the Other World\" began with his early articles concerning the Spiritualist movement.\n\nAlso in 1874, Olcott met Helena Blavatsky while both were visiting the Eddy farm. His foundational interest in the Spiritualist movement and his budding relationship with Blavatsky helped foster his development of spiritual philosophy.\n\nOlcott continued to act as a lawyer during the first few years of the establishment of the Theosophical Society, in addition to being a financial supporter of the new religious movement. In early 1875 Olcott was asked by prominent Spiritualists to investigate an accusation of fraud against the mediums Jenny and Nelson Holmes, who had claimed to materialize the famous \"spirit control\" Katie King (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 269–277).\n\nIn 1880 Helena Blavatsky and Olcott became the first Westerners to receive the refuges and precepts, the ceremony by which one traditionally becomes a Buddhist; thus Blavatsky was the first Western woman to do so. Olcott once described his adult faith as \"pure, primitive Buddhism,\" but his was a unique sort of Buddhism.\n\nFrom 1874 on, Olcott's spiritual growth and development with Blavatsky and other spiritual leaders would lead to the founding of the Theosophical Society.\nIn 1875, Olcott, Blavatsky, and others, notably William Quan Judge, formed the Theosophical Society in New York City, USA. Olcott financially supported the earliest years of the Theosophical Society and was acting President while Blavatsky served as the Society's Secretary.\n\nIn December 1878, they left New York in order to move the headquarters of the Society to India.\nThey landed at Bombay on February 16, 1879. Olcott set out to experience the native country of his spiritual leader, the Buddha. The headquarters of the Society were established at Adyar, Chennai as the Theosophical Society Adyar, starting also the Adyar Library and Research Centre within the headquarters.\n\nWhile in India, Olcott strove to receive the translations of sacred oriental texts which were becoming available as a result of western researches. His intent was to avoid the Westernized interpretations often encountered in America, and to discover the pure message of texts from the Buddhist, Hindu, and Zoroastrian religions, in order to properly educate Westerners.\n\nOlcott's research and translation efforts put him in dialogue with early, ostensibly secular anthropologists and scholars of religion. He corresponded extensively with Max Müller, asking questions related to his interest in Hinduism and Buddhism and sharing discoveries from his travels in South Asia. He also personally met both Müller and Edward Burnett Tylor at least once at the University of Oxford.\n\nOlcott's main religious interest was Buddhism, and he is commonly known for his work in Sri Lanka. After a two-year correspondence with Ven. Piyarathne Thissa, he and Blavatsky arrived in the then capital Colombo on May 16, 1880. Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steele Olcott took Five Precepts at the Wijayananda Viharaya located at Weliwatta in Galle on May 19, 1880.\nOn that day Olcott and Blavatsky were formally acknowledged as Buddhists, although Olcott noted that they had previously declared themselves Buddhists, while still living in America.\n\nDuring his time in Sri Lanka Olcott strove to revive Buddhism within the region, while compiling the tenets of Buddhism for the education of Westerners. It was during this period that he wrote the \"Buddhist Catechism\" (1881), which is still used today.\n\nThe Theosophical Society built several Buddhist schools in Ceylon, most notably Ananda College and Nalanda College, Colombo, Dharmaraja College in Kandy, Mahinda College in Galle,Musaeus Girls College, Colombo Maliyadeva College in Kurunegala and Dharmasoka College in Ambalangoda.\nOlcott also acted as an adviser to the committee appointed to design a Buddhist flag in 1885. The Buddhist flag designed with the assistance of Olcott was later adopted as a symbol by the World Fellowship of Buddhists and as the universal flag of all Buddhist traditions.\n\nHelena Blavatsky eventually went to live in London, where she died in 1891, but Olcott stayed in India and pursued the work of the Theosophical Society there.\nOlcott's role in the Theosophical Society would still be as President, but the induction of Annie Besant sparked a new era of the movement. Upon his death, the Theosophical Society elected her to take over as President and leader of the movement.\n\nOlcott's \"Buddhist Catechism\", composed in 1881, is one of his most enduring contributions to the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, and remains in use there today. The text outlines what Olcott saw to be the basic doctrines of Buddhism, including the life of the Buddha, the message of the Dharma, the role of the Sangha. The text also treats how the Buddha's message correlates with contemporary society. Olcott was considered by South Asians and others as a Buddhist revivalist.\n\nIt is presented in the same format of question and answer used in some Christian catechisms. Here are a few examples from that text:\n\nOlcott's catechism reflects a new, post-Enlightenment interpretation of traditional Buddhist tenets. As David McMahan stated, \"[Olcott] allied Buddhism with scientific rationalism in implicit criticism of orthodox Christianity, but went well beyond the tenets of conventional science in extrapolating from the Romantic- and Transcendentalist-influenced 'occult sciences' of the nineteenth century.\"\n\nThe Theosophists combination of spiritualism and science to investigate the supernatural reflected the society's desire to combine of religion and reason and to produce a rationally spiritual movement. This \"occult science\" within the Theosophical Society was used to find the \"truth\" behind all of the world's major religions. Through their research, Olcott and Blavatsky concluded that Buddhism best embodied elements of what they found significant in all religions.\n\nOlcott utilized scientific reasoning in his synthesis and presentation of Buddhism. This is clearly seen in a chapter of his \"Buddhist Catechism\", entitled \"Buddhism and Science\". Notably, his efforts represent one of the earliest attempts to combine scientific understanding and reasoning with Buddhist religion. The interrelationship he saw between Buddhism and Science paralleled his Theosophical approach to show the scientific bases for supernatural phenomena such as auras, hypnosis, and Buddhist \"miracles\".\n\nOlcott was President of the Theosophical Society until his death on February 17, 1907.\n\nTwo major streets in Colombo and Galle have been named Olcott Mawatha, to commemorate him. A statue of him has been erected in front of Colombo Fort Railway Station. Many other schools that he helped found or have been founded in his memory possess commemorative statues in honour of his contribution to Buddhist education. He is still remembered fondly by many Sri Lankans today. On September 10, 2011, a statue of Colonel Olcott was unveiled at a Buddhist temple near Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nThe date of his death is often remembered by Buddhist centers and Sunday schools in present-day Sri Lanka, as well as in Theosophical communities around the globe. Olcott believed himself to be Asia's savior, the outsider hero who would sweep in at the end of the drama to save a disenchanted subcontinent from spiritual death.\n\nThe effort to revitalize Buddhism within Sri Lanka was successful and influenced many native Buddhist intellectuals. Sri Lanka was dominated by British colonial power and influence at the time, and many Buddhists heard Olcott's interpretation of the Buddha's message as socially motivating and supportive of efforts to overturn colonialist efforts to ignore Buddhism and Buddhist tradition. This was despite the fact that his re-interpretation of the Buddha was along modern liberal ideas promoted by the British in Sri Lanka. As David McMahan wrote, \"Henry Steel Olcott saw the Buddha as a figure much like the ideal liberal freethinker – someone full of 'benevolence,' 'gratitude,' and 'tolerance,' who promoted 'brotherhood among all men' as well as 'lessons in manly self-reliance\". His Westernized view of Buddha influenced Sri Lankan leaders, such as Anagarika Dharmapala.\n\nOlcott and Anagarika Dharmapala were associates, which reflects both men's awareness of the divide between East and West—as seen in their presentation of Buddhism to the West. Olcott helped financially support the Buddhist presence at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, 1893. The inclusion of Buddhists in the Parliament allowed for the expansion of Buddhism within the West in general and in America specifically, leading to other Buddhist Modernist movements.\n\nAs Stephen Prothero wrote,\n\nIt was Olcott who most eloquently articulated and most obviously embodied the diverse religious and cultural traditions that shaped Protestant Buddhism, who gave the revival movement both its organizational shape and its emphasis on education-as-character-building. The most Protestant of all early Protestant Buddhists, Olcott was the liminoid figure, the griot who because of his awkward standing betwixt and between the American Protestant grammars of his youth and the Asian Buddhist lexicon of his adulthood was able to conjure traditional Sinhalese Buddhism, Protestant modernism, metropolitan gentility, and academic Orientalism into a decidedly new creole tradition. This creole tradition Olcott then passed on to a whole generation of Sinhalese students educated in his schools.\nOlcott is probably the only major contributor to the nineteenth-century Sinhalese Buddhist revival who was actually born and raised in the Protestant Christian tradition, though he had already left Protestantism for Spiritualism long before he became a Buddhist. His childhood Protestantism is a reason that many scholars have referred to the Buddhist modernism he influenced as \"Protestant Buddhism\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, the term has grown to also have strong negative connotations of a marriage that is of short duration and quickly ends in separation or divorce. The term developed the negative connotations fairly early; by the 1930s, a \"Hollywood marriage\" was a marriage both glamorous and short-lived. This connotation may also have related, at times, to moral panics over Hollywood's influence on the culture.\n\nSympathetic views of celebrities point out that in Hollywood, it is mostly the bad marriages that are documented by the media, giving a skewed perspective that might make \"Hollywood marriages\" appear to have a worse success rate than they have in reality. In 1972 Bob Thomas of the Associated Press remarked specifically about the tendency to ignore lasting celebrity marriages with the examples he gave including Bob Hope's marriage to Dolores Hope and Rosalind Russell's marriage to producer Frederick Brisson.\n\nNegative views of Hollywood marriages take the position that the divorce rates are indeed unusually high among celebrities and that this is caused by faults within Hollywood as a culture or by personal faults of the celebrities themselves. They point to the usage of weddings as publicity stunts, the egotism or immaturity of celebrities or \"celebrity culture\", and high rates of infidelity or promiscuity. Bee Wilson, in an article for \"The Daily Telegraph\", critiqued \"Hollywood marriages\" for often being based on the unrealistic dreams of what she termed \"permanent children,\" although she points to some classic Hollywood couples, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart or Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, as exceptions to these criticisms. While the introduction to the \"Cultural Sociology of Divorce: An Encyclopedia\" edited by Robert E. Emery specifically mentions Hollywood divorces as epitomizing a \"consumerist, throw-away-marriage view found in the West.\"\n\nThe actors and entertainers themselves vary in perspective on the commonality or reason for divorce in Hollywood. In 1961 Anne Baxter stated Hollywood was \"the most difficult place in America for marriage\" due, in part, to the \"terrible extremes of success and failure\" both spouses may face. In a 1964 interview Mitzi Gaynor, who would remain married to the husband mentioned in the interview until his death, took the more \"defensive\" position that \"Hollywood\" couples look different mostly because \"everything we do is magnified.\" Although she conceded they might be slightly different because \"you have to be a little off-center to get into this business in the first place.\"\n\nBeyond anecdote or opinion the actual evidence on the matter is complicated by differing definitions of who qualifies as a \"celebrity\" or \"Hollywood.\" That stated a study from Radford University placed \"dancers and choreographers\" as the occupations having the highest percent currently divorced with \"Entertainers and performers, sports and related workers, all other\" still being above average at tenth. That placed them between \"Nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides\" at ninth and \"Baggage porters and concierges\" at eleventh. In 1900 \"actors, professional showmen\" were listed as having the highest divorce rate of occupations, but as this predates even the incorporation of Hollywood it refers to the profession itself rather than \"Hollywood\" or \"celebrity culture\" as we know it. A Forbes article placed \"professional athletes and entertainers\" together and with a high divorce rate.\n\nThe idea that the term \"Hollywood marriage\" equates to something short-term is sometimes displayed by citing celebrities who had marriages that ended in divorce, separation, or annulment within approximately one year. The following examples of that are primarily restricted to marriages involving a notable actor or director linked to \"Hollywood\" in some way.\n\nEntertainment couples that last for decades, and/or life, are occasionally used as a counterpoint when referring to \"Hollywood marriage\". In relation to that, here is a selection of entertainers who have or had marriages that lasted over 50 years.\n\nLegend:\n\nAdd marriage\nJohn McIntire Jeanette Nolan married 1935 to January 30, 1991 (his death)\n\n\n\n"}

He then became the Commissioner General of Indigenous People (Commissioner of Bantu Affairs) from 1970 to 1978.

{"id": "143436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143436", "title": "John Reed (journalist)", "text": "John Reed (journalist)\n\nJohn Silas \"Jack\" Reed (October 22, 1887 – October 17, 1920) was an American journalist, poet, and socialist activist, best remembered for \"Ten Days That Shook the World\", his first-hand account of the Bolshevik Revolution. He married the writer and feminist Louise Bryant in 1916. Reed died of typhus in Russia in 1920. He is one of three Americans honored by being buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis (the others are labor organizer Bill Haywood and Charles Ruthenburg, founder of the Communist Party USA).\n\nJohn Silas Reed was born on October 22, 1887, in his maternal grandparents' mansion in what is now the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. His grandmother's household had Chinese servants. Reed wrote of paying a nickel to a \"Goose Hollowite\" (young toughs in a gang in the working-class neighborhood below King's Hill) to keep from being beaten up. In 2001 a memorial bench dedicated to Reed was installed in Washington Park, which overlooks the site of Reed's birthplace (the mansion no longer exists). \n\nHis mother, Margaret (Green) Reed, was the daughter of Portland industrialist Henry Dodge Green, who had made a fortune founding and operating three businesses: the first gas & light company, the first pig iron smelter on the West Coast, and the Portland water works (he was its second owner). SW Green Avenue was named in his honor.\n\nJohn's father, Charles Jerome Reed, was born in the East and came to Portland as the representative of an agricultural machinery manufacturer. With his ready wit, he quickly won acceptance in Portland's business community. The couple had married in 1886, and the family's wealth came from the Green side, not the Reed side. \n\nA sickly child, young \"Jack\" grew up surrounded by nurses and servants. His mother carefully selected his upper-class playmates. He had a brother, Harry, who was two years younger. Jack and his brother were sent to the recently established Portland Academy, a private school. Jack was bright enough to pass his courses but could not be bothered to work for top marks, as he found school dry and tedious. In September 1904, he was sent to Morristown, a New Jersey prep school, to prepare for college. His father, who did not attend college, wanted his sons to go to Harvard. At Morristown Jack continued his poor classroom performance, but made the football team and showed some literary promise.\nReed failed his first attempt at Harvard College's admission exam but passed on his second try, and enrolled in the fall of 1906. Tall, handsome, and lighthearted, he threw himself into all manner of student activities. He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club, served on the editorial boards of the \"Lampoon\" and \"The Harvard Monthly\", and was president of the Harvard Glee Club. In 1910 he held a position in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and also wrote music and lyrics for their show \"Diana's Debut\". Reed failed to make the football and crew teams, but excelled in swimming and water polo. He was also made \"Ivy orator and poet\" in his senior year.\n\nReed attended meetings of the Socialist Club, over which his friend Walter Lippmann presided, but never joined. The group introduced legislation into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration to establish a course on socialism. Reed later recalled:\n\nAll this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like H.G. Wells and Graham Wallas, wrenching us away from the Oscar Wildian dilettantism which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.\n\nReed graduated from Harvard College in 1910. That summer he set out to see more of the \"dull outside world,\" visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring. Reed worked as a common laborer on a cattle boat to pay his fare to Europe. His travels were encouraged by his favorite professor, Charles Townsend Copeland (\"Copey\"), who told him he must \"see life\" if he wanted to successfully write about it.\n\nReed had determined to become a journalist, and set out to make his mark in New York, a center of the industry. Reed made use of a valuable contact from Harvard, Lincoln Steffens, who was establishing a reputation as a muckraker. He appreciated Reed's skills and intellect at an early date. Steffens landed his young admirer an entry-level position on \"The American Magazine\", where he read manuscripts, corrected proofs, and later helped with the composition. Reed supplemented his insufficient salary by taking an additional job as the business manager of a new short-lived quarterly magazine called \"Landscape Architecture.\"\nReed made his home in Greenwich Village, a burgeoning hub of poets, writers, activists, and artists. He came to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it. His formal jobs on the magazines paid the rent, but it was as a freelance journalist that Reed sought to establish himself. He collected rejection slips, circulating an essay and short stories about his six months in Europe, eventually breaking through in \"The Saturday Evening Post.\" Within a year, Reed had other work accepted by \"Collier's,\" \"The Forum,\" and \"The Century Magazine.\" One of his poems was set to music by composer Arthur Foote. The editors at \"The American\" came to see him as a contributor and began to publish his work.\n\nReed's serious interest in social problems was first aroused about this time by Steffens and Ida Tarbell. He moved beyond them to a more radical political position than theirs. In 1913 he joined the staff of \"The Masses\", edited by Max Eastman. Reed contributed more than 50 articles, reviews, and shorter pieces to this socialist publication.\n\nThe first of Reed's many arrests came in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of strikers in the New Jersey silk mills. The harsh treatment meted out by the authorities to the strikers and the short jail term he served further radicalized Reed. He allied with the syndicalist trade union, the Industrial Workers of the World. His account of his experiences was published in June as an article, \"War in Paterson.\" During the same year, following a suggestion made by IWW leader Bill Haywood, Reed put on \"The Pageant of the Paterson Strike\" in Madison Square Garden as a benefit for the strikers.\n\nIn the autumn of 1913, Reed was sent to Mexico by the \"Metropolitan Magazine\" to report the Mexican Revolution. He shared the perils of Pancho Villa's army for four months and was with Villa's Constitutional (Constitutionalist) Army (whose \"Primer Jefe\" political chief was Venustiano Carranza) when it defeated Federal forces at Torreón, opening the way for its advance on Mexico City. Reed adored Villa, but Carranza left him cold.\n\nReed's reporting on the Villistas in a series of outstanding magazine articles gained him a national reputation as a war correspondent. Reed deeply sympathized with the peons and vehemently opposed American intervention; US forces occupied Veracruz. Reed's reports were collected and published as the book \"Insurgent Mexico\" (1914). \n\nOn April 30, 1914, Reed arrived in Colorado, scene of the recent Ludlow massacre, a result of owners' suppression of labor organizing. There he spent a little more than a week, during which he investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, and wrote an impassioned article on the subject (\"The Colorado War\", published in July). He came to believe much more deeply in class conflict. \n\nReed spent summer 1914 in Provincetown, Massachusetts with Mabel Dodge and her son, putting together \"Insurgent Mexico\" and interviewing President Wilson on the subject. The resulting report, much watered down at White House insistence, was not a success.\n\nOn August 14, 1914, shortly after Germany declared war on France, Reed set sail for neutral Italy, on assignment for the \"Metropolitan\". He met his lover Mabel Dodge in Naples, and the pair made their way to Paris. Reed believed the war was the result of imperialist commercial rivalries and felt little sympathy for any of the parties. \n\nIn an unsigned piece titled \"The Traders' War,\" published in the September 1914 issue of \"The Masses,\" Reed wrote:\n\nIn France, Reed was frustrated by wartime censorship and the difficulty of reaching the front. Reed and Dodge went to London, and Dodge soon left for New York, to Reed's relief. The rest of 1914 he spent drinking with French prostitutes and pursuing an affair with a German woman. The pair went to Berlin in early December. While there, Reed interviewed Karl Liebknecht, one of the few socialists in Germany to vote against war credits. Reed was deeply disappointed by the general collapse in working-class solidarity promised by the Second International, and by its replacement with militarism and nationalism.\n\nHe returned to New York in December and wrote more about the war. In 1915 he traveled to Central Europe, accompanied by Boardman Robinson, a Canadian artist and frequent \"Masses\" contributor. Traveling from Thessaloniki, they saw scenes of profound devastation in Serbia (including a bombed-out Belgrade), also going through Bulgaria and Romania. They passed through the Jewish Pale of Settlement in Bessarabia. In Chełm they were arrested and incarcerated for several weeks. At risk of being shot for espionage, they were saved by the American ambassador.\n\nTraveling to Russia, Reed was outraged to learn that the American ambassador in Petrograd was inclined to believe they were spies. Reed and Robinson were rearrested when they tried to slip into Romania. This time the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) finally secured permission for them to leave, but not until after all their papers were seized in Kiev. In Bucharest, the duo spent time piecing together more of their journey. At one point Reed traveled to Constantinople in hopes of seeing action at Gallipoli. From these experiences he wrote the book, \"The War in Eastern Europe,\" published in April 1916.\n\nAfter returning to New York, Reed visited his mother in Portland. There he met and fell in love with Louise Bryant, who joined him on the East coast in January 1916. Though happy, both also had affairs with others, in accordance with their bohemian circle and ideas about sexual liberation. Early in 1916 Reed met the young playwright Eugene O'Neill. Beginning that May, the three rented a cottage in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a summer destination on Cape Cod for many artists and writers from Greenwich Village. Not long after, Bryant and O'Neill began a romance.\n\nThat summer Reed covered the Presidential nominating conventions. He endorsed Woodrow Wilson, believing that he would make good on his promise to keep America out of the war. In November 1916 he married Bryant in Peekskill, New York. The same year, he underwent an operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital to remove a kidney. He was hospitalized until mid-December. The operation rendered him ineligible for conscription and saved him from registering as a conscientious objector, as had been his intention. During 1916 he privately published \"Tamburlaine and Other Verses\", in an edition of 500 copies.\n\nAs the country raced towards war, Reed was marginalized: his relationship with the \"Metropolitan\" was over. He pawned his late father's watch and sold his Cape Cod cottage to the birth control activist and sex educator Margaret Sanger. \n\nWhen Wilson asked for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, Reed shouted at a hastily convened meeting of the People's Council in Washington: \"This is not my war, and I will not support it. This is not my war, and I will have nothing to do with it.\" In July and August Reed continued to write vehement articles against the war for \"The Masses\", which the United States Postal Service refused to mail, and for \"Seven Arts.\" Due to antiwar articles by Reed and Randolph Bourne, the arts magazine lost its financial backing and ceased publication. Reed was stunned by the nation's pro-war fervor, and his career lay in ruins.\n\nOn August 17, 1917, Reed and Bryant set sail from New York to Europe, having first provided the State Department with legally sworn assurances that neither would represent the Socialist Party at a forthcoming conference in Stockholm. The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. Traveling by way of Finland, the pair arrived in the capital city of Petrograd immediately after the failed military coup of monarchist General Lavr Kornilov. This was an attempt to topple the Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky by force of arms. Reed and Bryant found the Russian economy in shambles. Several of the subject nations of the old empire, such as Finland and Ukraine, had gained autonomy and were seeking separate military accommodations with Germany.\n\nReed and Bryant were in Petrograd for the October Revolution, in which the Bolshevik Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, headed by Vladimir Lenin, toppled the Kerensky government; the Bolsheviks believed this was the first blow of a worldwide socialist revolution.\n\nFood shortages made the situation dire in the capital, and social disorder reigned. Reed later recalled:\n\nThe last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down — milk and everything of that sort.\n\nA mood for radical change was in the air. The Bolsheviks, seeking an all-socialist government and immediate end to Russian participation in the war, sought the transfer of power from Kerensky to a Congress of Soviets, a gathering of elected workers' and soldiers' deputies to be convened in October. The Kerensky government considered this a kind of coup, and moved to shut down the Bolshevik press. It issued warrants of arrest for the Soviet leaders and prepared to transfer the troops of the Petrograd garrison, believed to be unreliable, back to the front. A Military Revolutionary Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik Party, determined to seize power on behalf of the future Congress of Soviets. At 11 pm on the evening of November 7, 1917, it captured the Winter Palace, the seat of Kerensky's government. Reed and Bryant were present during the fall of the Winter Palace, the symbolic event that started the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nReed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new revolutionary socialist government. He went to work for the new People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, translating decrees and news of the new government into English. \"I also collaborated in the gathering of material and data and distributing of papers to go into the German trenches,\" Reed later recalled.\n\nReed was close to the inner circle of the new government. He met Leon Trotsky and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the Constituent Assembly on January 18, 1918. By December, his funds were nearly exhausted, and he took a job with American Raymond Robins of the International Red Cross. Robins wanted to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied. But in the dummy issue he prepared, he included a warning beneath the masthead: \"This paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital.\"\n\nThe dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved. Two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of Red Guards prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack. Reed attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, saying he hoped it would \"call forth an answer from America's oppressed and exploited masses.\" American journalist Edgar Sisson told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted. \n\nIn January, Trotsky, responding to Reed's concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York. As the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, Reed's credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he would have faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). Most Americans in Petrograd considered Reed's appointment a massive blunder. Businessman Alexander Gumberg met with Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for setting up a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. Lenin found the proposal unsavory and withdrew Reed's nomination. Learning of Gumberg's intervention, Reed always denigrated him afterward.\n\nReed and Bryant wrote and published books about their Russian experiences. Bryant's \"Six Red Months in Russia\" appeared first, but Reed's \"10 Days That Shook the World\" (1919) garnered more notice.\n\nBryant returned to the United States in January 1918, but Reed did not reach New York City until April 28. On his way back, Reed traveled from Russia to Finland; he did not have a visa or passport while crossing to Finland. In Turku harbor, when Reed was boarding a ship on his way to Stockholm, Finnish police arrested him; he was held at Kakola prison in Turku until he was released. From Finland, Reed traveled to Kristiania, Norway via Stockholm. \n\nBecause he remained under indictment in the \"Masses\" case, federal authorities immediately met Reed when his ship reached New York, holding him on board for more than eight hours while they searched his belongings. Reed's papers, the material from which he intended to write his book, were seized. He was released upon his own recognizance after his attorney, Morris Hillquit, promised to make him available at the Federal Building the next day. His papers were not returned to him until November.\n\nBack in America, Reed and Bryant defended the Bolsheviks and opposed the American intervention. Incensed at Russia's departure from the war against Germany, the public gave Reed a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in \"The Masses\", particularly one headlined \"Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy\", had been instrumental in the government gaining an indictment for sedition against the magazine (antiwar agitation was considered sedition and treason). \n\nThe first \"Masses\" trial ended in a hung jury the day before Reed reached New York. The defendants, including him, were to be retried. He immediately posted $2,000 bail on April 29. The second \"Masses\" trial also ended in a hung jury.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Reed stood outside a closed hall on May 31, and harangued a crowd of 1,000 about the case and the war until police dragged him away. He was arrested for inciting a riot, and posted $5,000 bail. Reed became more aggressively political, intolerant, and self-destructive. On September 14, he was arrested for the third time since returning from Russia, charged with violating the Sedition Act and freed on $5,000 bail. This was a day after possibly the largest demonstration for Bolshevik Russia was held in the United States (in The Bronx). Reed had passionately defended the revolution, which he seemed to think was coming to America as well. He tried to prevent Allied intervention in Russia, arguing that the Russians were contributing to the war effort by checking German ambitions in the Ukraine and Japanese designs on Siberia, but this argument came to naught. \n\nOn February 21–22, 1919, Bryant was fiercely grilled before a Senate committee exploring Bolshevik propaganda activities in the US, but emerged resilient. Reed followed her. According to Homberger, his testimony was \"savagely distorted\" by the press. Later that day Reed went to Philadelphia to stand trial for his May speech; despite a hostile judge, press, and patriotic speech by the prosecutor, Reed's lawyer convinced the jury the case was about free speech, and he was acquitted. Returning to New York, Reed continued speaking widely and participating in the various twists of socialist politics that year. He served as editor of \"The New York Communist,\" the weekly newspaper issued by the Left Wing Section of Greater New York.\n\nAffiliated with the Left Wing of the Socialist Party, Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919. The radicals split into two bitterly hostile groups, forming the Communist Labor Party of America (Reed's group, which he helped create) and, the next day, the Communist Party of America. Reed was the international delegate of the former, wrote its manifesto and platform, edited its paper, \"The Voice of Labor\", and was denounced as \"Jack the Liar\" in the Communist Party organ, \"The Communist\". Reed's writings of 1919 displayed doubts about Western-style democracy and defended the dictatorship of the proletariat. He believed this was a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy \"based upon equality and the liberty of the individual.\"\n\nIndicted for sedition and hoping to secure Comintern backing for the CLP, Reed fled America with a forged passport in early October 1919 on a Scandinavian frigate; he worked his way to Bergen as a stoker. Given shore leave, he disappeared to Kristiania, crossed into Sweden on October 22, passed through Finland and made his way to Moscow by train. In the cold winter of 1919–20, he traveled in the region around Moscow, observing factories, communes, and villages. He filled notebooks with his writing and had an affair with a Russian woman.\n\nReed's feelings about the revolution became ambivalent. Activist Emma Goldman had recently arrived aboard the \"Buford\", among hundreds of aliens deported by the United States under the Sedition Act. She was especially concerned about the Cheka. Reed told her that the enemies of the revolution deserved their fate, but suggested that she see Angelica Balabanoff, a critic of the current situation. He wanted Goldman to hear the other side.\n\nThough facing the threat of arrest in Illinois, Reed tried to return to the United States in February 1920. At that time, the Soviets organized a convention to establish a United Communist Party of America. Reed attempted to leave Russia through Latvia, but his train never arrived, forcing him to hitch a ride in the boxcar of an eastbound military train to Petrograd. In March, he crossed into Helsinki, where he had radical friends, including Hella Wuolijoki, the future politician and SDKL member of parliament. With their help, he was hidden in the hold of a freighter. \n\nOn the 13th, customs officials in Finland found Reed in a coal bunker on the ship. He was taken to the police station, where he maintained that he was seaman \"Jim Gormley\". Eventually, the jewels, photographs, letters, and fake documents he had in his possession forced him to reveal his true identity. Although beaten several times and threatened with torture, he refused to surrender the names of his local contacts. Because of his silence, he could not be tried for treason. He was charged and convicted of smuggling and having jewels in his possession (102 small diamonds worth $14,000, which were confiscated).\n\nThe US Secretary of State was satisfied with Reed's arrest and pressured the Finns for his papers. American authorities, however, remained indifferent to Reed's fate. Although Reed paid the fine for smuggling, he was still detained illegally. His physical condition and state of mind deteriorated rapidly. He suffered from depression and insomnia, wrote alarming letters to Bryant, and on May 18 threatened a hunger strike. He was finally released in early June, and sailed for Tallinn, Estonia, on the 5th. Two days later, he traveled to Petrograd, recuperating from malnutrition and scurvy caused by having been fed dried fish almost exclusively. His spirits were high.\n\nAt the end of June, Reed traveled to Moscow. After he discussed with Bryant the possibility of her joining him, she gained passage on a Swedish tramp steamer and arrived in Gothenburg on August 10. At the same time, Reed attended the second Comintern congress. Although his mood was as jovial and boisterous as ever, his physical appearance had deteriorated.\n\nDuring this congress, Reed bitterly objected to the deference other revolutionaries showed to the Russians. The latter believed the tide of revolutionary fervor was ebbing, and that the Communist party needed to work within the existing institutions – a policy Reed felt would be disastrous. He was contemptuous of the bullying tactics displayed during the congress by Karl Radek and Grigory Zinoviev, who ordered Reed to attend the Congress of the Peoples of the East to be held at Baku on August 15.\n\nThe journey to Baku was a long one, five days by train through countryside that was devastated by civil war and infected by typhus. Reed was reluctant to go. He asked for permission to travel later, as he wanted to meet Bryant in Petrograd after she arrived from Murmansk. Zinoviev insisted that Reed take the official train: \"the Comintern has made a decision. Obey.\" Reed, needing Soviet goodwill and unprepared for a final break with the Comintern, made the trip with reluctance. Years after having abandoned Communism himself, his friend Benjamin Gitlow asserted that Reed became bitterly disillusioned with the Communist movement because of his treatment by Zinoviev.\n\nDuring his time in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant's arrival in Moscow. He followed her there, arriving on September 15, and was able to tell her of the events of the preceding eight months. He appeared older and his clothes were in tatters. While in Moscow, he took her to meet Lenin, Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, and other leading Bolsheviks, and also to visit Moscow's ballet and art galleries.\n\nReed was determined to return to the United States but fell ill on September 25. At first thought to have influenza, he was hospitalized five days later and diagnosed with spotted typhus. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied blockade. His mind started to wander, and then he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920. After a hero's funeral, his body was buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. He is one of three Americans honored by being buried there.\n\nThe interpretation of Reed in popular culture has been varied. Some have dismissed him as a \"romantic revolutionary\" and a \"playboy\", a vapid dilettante pretending to profess revolutionary sensibilities. For the Communist movement to which he belonged, Reed became a symbol of the international nature of the Bolshevik revolution, a martyr buried at the Kremlin wall amidst solemn fanfare, his name to be uttered reverently as a member of the radical pantheon. Others, such as his old friend and comrade Benjamin Gitlow, claimed that Reed had begun to shun the bureaucracy and violence of Soviet Communism late in his life. They sought to posthumously enlist Reed in their own anti-communist cause.\n\n\nTwo films are based on Reed's accounts of the Mexican Revolution, one with two parts released a year apart. Mexican director Paul Leduc made \"\" (1973). A Mexican–Soviet-Italian co-production released \"Red Bells\" (1982) and \"Red Bells II\" (1983), both directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, with Franco Nero as Reed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jebsen recruited Dušan Popov (who became the British agent Tricycle) to the and through him later joined the Allied cause. Kidnapped from Lisbon by the Germans shortly before the Normandy landings, Jebsen was tortured in prison and spent time in a concentration camp before disappearing, presumed killed, at the end of the war.\n\nJebsen was born in Hamburg in 1917, heir to the shipping firm Jebsen & Jebsen. His parents, who both died whilst Jebsen was still a child, were of Danish origin but held German citizenship, after moving the company to the country. Even early on, Jebsen considered his citizenship a convenience, with deep roots remaining in his Danish ancestry. During childhood he visited England and became enamoured with the country, adopting the mannerisms and the language.\n\nJebsen attended the University of Freiburg during the 1930s, where he became close friends with Duško Popov. During this time, both showed distaste for the Nazi regime that was emerging in Germany. After graduation Jebsen moved to England, intending to study at Oxford University, although it appears he never did this. Over the next few years he moved amongst the London social set, befriending P. G. Wodehouse amongst others.\n\nAt the outset of the Second World War, Jebsen joined the German military intelligence agency—the —largely as a way to avoid compulsory service in the army. He was given a vague brief as an independent \"researcher\" and assigned the rank of private. In reality it meant he could continue his normal activities as an international businessman, so long as he was available to help the when it required.\n\nIn 1940, Jebsen arranged an introduction between Popov, who the Germans hoped to recruit as an agent, and a senior officer in Belgrade. The meeting led to Popov's recruitment, upon which he instantly offered his services to the Allies as a double agent. It is likely that Jebsen knew this early on, and often passed information to Popov which the latter believed was intended for Allied hands.\n\nDuring the war, Jebsen travelled freely on business, although it was not clear what he did. He married Eleonore Bothilde Peterson, an actress from Frankfurt, but had a string of mistresses across Europe. Jebsen's anti-Nazi stance led to clashes with the SS, and its intelligence office, the .\n\nThrough 1943, Jebsen, Dušan Popov and his brother Ivo (also an agent, codenamed Dreadnought) ran an operation to recruit double agents from Yugoslavia. Ivo Popov identified potential candidates, who were told they would be working for the British. First they were sent to Berlin, under the care of Jebsen, for training in the spy school before ultimately ending up in Britain (via Spain and Portugal) to work for MI5.\n\nOn , Jebsen was abducted from Lisbon, Portugal, and driven overnight to France. Aloys Schreiber, the head of German counter-intelligence in Lisbon, had invited Jebsen to his office on the pretext of discussing his pending War Merit Medal. After a brief struggle Jebsen and his friend (Heinz Moldenhauer) were overpowered and bundled into a car.\n\nJebsen's disappearance was a serious concern for the Allies. He had been privy to a great deal of information, not just the knowledge of Popov's double agent role, but the fact that Agent Garbo's network of sub-agents was fiction and familiarity with many details of Operation Fortitude. If he talked, the entire cover plan for the Normandy landings was at risk. After much analysis the intelligence services decided that Jebsen had been snatched because the believed he was planning to defect, rather than that he had already turned. It is possible that Jebsen was abducted to protect Popov, who the Germans considered one of their most important agents. As a precaution, the Allies suspended Popov's network of fictional sub-agents and his transmissions to his German handlers.\n\nAt first Jebsen was taken to the Gestapo headquarters in Berlin, where his interrogation began. After a few weeks the Allies were encouraged, intercepts of German communications showed the Germans were interested in Jebsen's finances (he had been defrauding a number of SS officers) – there was no mention of his activities as an agent. As time progressed it appeared that agent Artist had not cracked under pressure and the \"Fortitude\" deception was safe.\n\nIn July 1944, Jebsen was moved to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. When he arrived he had broken ribs and was malnourished, but still harboured thoughts of escape. He told Allied soldiers, also held in the camp, that he had been accused of helping the British and when he had refused to talk his financial fraud had been investigated. Eventually he got a message to London via a British Commando, Jack Churchill, however the War Office had no record of Jebsen's name and so the plea for help was ignored. In February 1945, Gestapo agents removed Jebsen from Sachsenhausen; it is the last sighting of him and he is presumed to have been murdered soon after. Several attempts to find him after the war were unsuccessful and he was legally declared dead on .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3194143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3194143", "title": "Julian the Hospitaller", "text": "Julian the Hospitaller\n\nJulian the Hospitaller is a Roman Catholic saint.\n\nThe earliest known reference to Julian dates to the late twelfth century.\n\nThere are three main theories of his origin:\n\nThe location of the hospitals built by him is also debated between the banks of the River Gardon in Provence and an island near the River Potenza heading to Macerata.\n\nHe was known as the patron of the cities of Ghent and Macerata. The Paternoster (Our Father prayer) of St. Julian can be found as early as 1353 in Boccaccio's \"Decameron\", and is still passed on by word of mouth throughout some places in Italy. The account is included the 13th-century \"Leggenda Aurea\" of Genoan Giacomo da Varazze, a Dominican priest. Beautiful stained glass depicting St. Julian by an unknown artist in the Cathedral of Chartres also dates back to the 13th century. Early fresco paintings of him are found in the Cathedral of Trento (14th century) and the Palazzo Comunale di Assisi.\n\nAccording to de Varazze, on the night Julian was born, his father, a man of noble blood, saw pagan witches secretly lay a curse on the boy that would make him kill both his parents. His father wanted to get rid of the child, but his mother did not let him do so. As the boy grew into a handsome young man, his mother would often burst into tears because of the sin her son was destined to commit. When he finally found out the reason for her tears, he swore he \"would never commit such a sin\" and \"with great belief in Christ went off full of courage\" as far away from his parents as he could. Some versions say that it was his mother who told him at the age of 10, while others say it was a stag he met in the forest while hunting (a situation used in depicting St. Julian in statues and pictures). After fifty days of walking he finally reached Galicia where he married a \"good woman\", said to be a wealthy widow.\n\nTwenty years later, his parents decided to go look for their now thirty-year-old son. When they arrived, they visited the altar of St. James, and \"as soon as they came out of the church they met a woman sitting on a chair outside, whom the pilgrims greeted and asked, for Jesus' love, whether she would host them for the night as they were tired.\" She let them in and told them that her husband, Julian, was out hunting. (This is why he is also known as the patron of hunters.) The mother and father were overjoyed to have found their son, as was Julian's wife. \"She took care of them well and had them rest in her and Julian's bed.\" But \"the enemy\" went off seeking Julian and told him: 'I have sour news for you. While you are here, hunting, your wife is in bed embracing another man. There they are right now, still sleeping.'\"\n\nDe Verazze continues: \"And Julian felt deep sadness and his face drew into a frown. He rode back home, went to his bed and found a man and a woman sleeping in it. He drew his sword and killed them both. He was about to take off and never again set foot in that land, but as he was leaving he saw his wife sitting among the other women. She told him: 'There are your mother and father resting in your room.' And so Julian knew, and fell into a rage. 'The shrewd enemy lied to me when he said my wife was betraying me', and while kissing their wounds he cried 'Better had I never been born, for I am cursed in soul and body.' And his good wife comforted him and said 'Have faith in Christ Almighty, a stream of life and mercy.' They had no children... Gold and silver they had a lot... And after seeking redemption in Rome, Julian built seven hospitals and twenty-five houses. And the poor started flowing to him, to Jesus' Almighty's love.\"\nDe Verazze continues: \"\"The enemy\" conspired again to ruin Julian—disguised as a weak pilgrim, he was let in by Julian with the others. At midnight he woke up and made a mess of the house.\" The following morning Julian saw the damage and swore never to let in anyone else in his home. He was so furious he had everyone leave. \"And Jesus went to him, again as a pilgrim, seeking rest. He asked humbly, in the name of God, for shelter. But Julian answered with contempt: 'I shall not let you in. Go away, for the other night I had my home so vandalized that I shall never let you in.' And Christ told him 'Hold my walking-stick, please.' Julian, embarrassed, went to take the stick, and it stuck to his hands. And Julian recognized him at once and said 'He tricked me, \"the enemy\" who does not want me to be your faithful servant. But I shall embrace you, I do not care about him; and for your love I shall give shelter to whoever needs.' He knelt and Jesus forgave him, and Julian asked, full of repentance, forgiveness for his wife and parents. Some versions skip the second mistake and tell of an angel visiting Julian and announcing to him that he is forgiven.\n\nDevotion to St. Julian started in the Maltese Islands in the 15th century after the discovery of his relics in the city of Macerata. It was introduced by the noble family of De Astis, high-ranking in Malta at the time, who had strong connections with the Bishop of Macerata. Three churches were built in his honor before the arrival of the Knights: in Tabija, towards Mdina; in Luqa; and in Senglea (Isla). This last one had a storage room for hunters, and served to popularize this devotion through the sailors arriving at the Three Cities. In the 16th century there existed a hospital, \"Ospedale di San Giuliano\", in the Citadel in Gozo, showing a wide devotion to the saint. Being an order of hospitaliers, the Knights of St. John helped widen further this devotion. In 1539 they rebuilt the church in Senglea and in 1590 built another church in the parish of Birkirkara, a section that since then was called St. Julian's. In 1891 the church was made a parish, the only one ever dedicated to the saint in Malta.\n\nSt. Julian was invoked as the patron of hospitality by travelers on a journey and far from home pray hoping to find safe lodging.\n\n\nThe Life of Saint Julian Hospitaller, (translated by Tony Devaney Morinelli).

The honors have been presented annually since 1978, culminating each December in a star-studded gala celebrating the honorees in the Kennedy Center Opera House.\n\nGeorge Stevens Jr. created the Kennedy Center Honors with the late Nick Vanoff, and produced the first gala in 1978. He was the producer and co-writer through the 2014 awards, after which he sold the production rights to the Kennedy Center.\n\nThe Kennedy Center Honors started in 1977, after that year's 10th-anniversary White House reception and Kennedy Center program for the American Film Institute (AFI). Roger L. Stevens, the founding chairman of the Kennedy Center, asked George Stevens, Jr., (no relation), the founding director of the AFI, to hold an event for the Center. George Stevens asked Isaac Stern to become involved, and then \"pitched\" the idea to the television network CBS, who \"bought it.\" With the announcement of the first honors event and honorees, CBS vice president for specials Bernie Sofronski stated:\n\nThe first host was Leonard Bernstein in 1978, followed by Eric Sevareid in 1979 and Beverly Sills in 1980. Walter Cronkite hosted from 1981 to 2002 and Caroline Kennedy hosted from 2003 until 2012. Glenn Close hosted in 2013 and Stephen Colbert hosted from 2014 to 2016. There was no formal host in 2017, though Caroline Kennedy delivered an introduction.\n\nRicky Kirshner and Glenn Weiss of White Cherry Entertainment were selected as Executive Producers of the 38th annual Kennedy Center Honors (2015) after George Stevens, Jr. stepped down.\n\nThis is one of the few awards shows that does not air live (with the exception of closed-circuit venues), but a re-edited version lasting approximately two hours is normally televised on CBS after Christmas.\n\nHonoree recommendations are accepted from the general public, and the Kennedy Center initiated a Special Honors Advisory Committee, which comprises two members of the Board of Trustees as well as past Honorees and distinguished artists. The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees selects the Honoree recipients based on excellence in music, dance, theater, opera, motion pictures or television. The selections are typically announced sometime between July and September.\n\nThe invitation-only weekend-long ceremony includes the Chairman's Luncheon, State Department dinner, White House reception, and the Honors gala performances and supper.\n\nSurrounded by the Honorees, the luncheon is held on Saturday at the Kennedy Center, with a welcoming speech by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees. At that evening's reception and dinner at the State Department, presided over by the Secretary of State, the Honorees are introduced and the Honors medallions are presented by the Chairman of the Board. The wide rainbow-colored ribbon then hung around the necks of the recipients, and prominently noticeable when the events are televised, symbolizes \"a spectrum of many skills within the performing arts\" according to creator Ivan Chermayeff.\n\nOn Sunday, there is an early-evening White House reception hosted by the President of the United States and the First Lady, followed by the Honors gala performance at the Kennedy Center and supper.\n\nFor the 2015 gala performance, President Barack Obama did attend, after addressing the nation in a live telecast. There have been four occasions where the President did not attend the gala performances: President Jimmy Carter did not attend the December 1979 gala performance during the hostage crisis, President George H.W. Bush did not attend in December 1989 and President Bill Clinton did not attend in 1994.\n\nOn August 19, 2017, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, have decided not to participate in events honoring recipients of the 2017 Kennedy Center Honors awards to \"allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction.\" At the 2017 ceremony, held on December 3, 2017, President and Mrs. Trump did not attend. Caroline Kennedy was the hostess and presented the honorees. The traditional dinner at the State Department on the Saturday evening before the ceremony was hosted by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the White House reception was canceled.\n\nThere have been 213 recipients to date of the Kennedy Center Honors Awards during the Honor's 40 years (as of 2017), although the one given to Bill Cosby in 1998 was rescinded in 2018, following his sexual assault conviction. The vast majority have been bestowed on individuals. On ten occasions since 1985, awards have been presented to duos or groups, including three married couples who were actors: Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, and Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. The dancers Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas of the Nicholas Brothers were honored, along with three musical theater songwriting duos: Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and John Kander and Fred Ebb. The musicians of three rock groups were also awarded: Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey of The Who, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, and Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh and (posthumously) Glenn Frey of the Eagles.\n\nThe 2018 award ceremony will present the honor, for the first time, to the creators of the musical \"Hamilton\": Lin-Manuel Miranda, Thomas Kail, Andy Blankenbuehler and Alex Lacamoire for \"trailblazing creators of a transformative work that defies category.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPianist Vladimir Horowitz was to be an honoree, but the selection committee withdrew the offer when Horowitz conditioned his acceptance on being honored alone and at 4 in the afternoon.\n\nActress Katharine Hepburn declined the committee's first offer, though she relented in 1990.\n\nDoris Day repeatedly turned down the honors because her fear of flying prevented her from attending the ceremony.\n\nWhen considering Irving Berlin for the 1987 awards because of criticism for overlooking him, the Center was informed that Berlin wanted to be honored only if he surpassed his 100th birthday (which would not be until May 1988). Also, he was in failing health, used a wheelchair following a series of strokes, and could not attend a public event. The Center instead chose to pay special tribute to him at the 1987 Gala. He died in 1989.\n\nPaul McCartney was selected as an honoree in 2002, but was unable to attend because of an \"inescapable personal obligation,\" his cousin's previously planned wedding. After initially saying that McCartney's award would be postponed until the following year, the Kennedy Center announced in August 2003 that \"Paul McCartney will not be receiving a Kennedy Center Honor.\" McCartney later became a 2010 honoree.\n\nMel Brooks has stated that he refused the honor when George W. Bush was in office, due to his distaste for Bush's Iraq policy, but Brooks was an honoree in 2009, the first year Barack Obama was President.\n\nIn November 2015, one month before the actual ceremony, the Eagles postponed their honors until the following year because Glenn Frey had intestinal problems that required major surgery and a long recovery period. Despite their absence, they were still honored in 2015 via a performance of \"Desperado\" by country singer Miranda Lambert. Glenn Frey died on January 18, 2016, though the Center made him and the three surviving members 2016 honorees.\n\nIn 2017, Norman Lear announced that he would accept the honors, but would boycott the White House ceremony because of his opposition to President Donald Trump, citing Trump's proposal to end the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts. Lear did attend the 2017 events and ceremony, but Donald and Melania Trump were not present, becoming the first U.S. presidential couple to skip the event, in order \"to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction\".\n\n\n"}

Her popularity was further enhanced by her film roles, such as \"I'll Never Forget What's'isname\" (1967), \"The Girl on a Motorcycle\" (1968), and \"Hamlet\" (1969). However, her popularity was overshadowed by personal problems in the 1970s. During that time she was anorexic, alcoholic and a heroin addict. \n\nNoted for her distinctive voice, Faithfull's previously melodic and higher registered vocals (which were prevalent throughout her career in the 1960s) were affected by severe laryngitis, coupled with persistent drug abuse during the 1970s, permanently altering her voice, leaving it raspy, cracked and lower in pitch. This new sound was praised as \"whisky soaked\" by some critics for helping capture the raw emotions expressed in her music.\n\nAfter a long commercial absence, Faithfull made a comeback with the 1979 release of her critically acclaimed album \"Broken English.\" The album was a commercial success and marked a resurgence of her musical career. \"Broken English\" earned Faithfull a nomination for Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and is often regarded as her \"definitive recording.\" She followed with a series of albums, including \"Dangerous Acquaintances\" (1981), \"A Child's Adventure\" (1983), and \"Strange Weather\" (1987). Faithfull also wrote three books about her life: \"\" (1994), \"Memories, Dreams & Reflections\" (2007), and \"Marianne Faithfull: A Life on Record\" (2014).\n\nFaithfull is listed on VH1's \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\" list. She received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Women's World Awards and was made a \"Commandeur\" of the \"Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\" by the government of France.\n\nFaithfull was born in Hampstead, London. Her half-brother is artist Simon Faithfull. Her father, Major Robert Glynn Faithfull, was a British intelligence officer and professor of Italian Literature at Bedford College of London University. Robert Glynn Faithfull's family lived in Ormskirk, Lancashire, while he completed a doctorate at Liverpool University. \n\nFaithfull's mother, Eva, was the daughter of an Austro-Hungarian nobleman, Artur Wolfgang, Ritter von Sacher-Masoch (1875–1953). Eva chose to style herself as Eva von Sacher-Masoch, Baroness Erisso. \n\nFaithfull's mother had been born in Budapest and moved to Vienna in 1918. The family of Sacher-Masoch had secretly opposed the Nazi regime in Vienna. Faithfull's father's intelligence work for the British Army brought him into contact with the family, and he thus met Eva, his future wife. Faithfull's maternal grandfather had aristocratic roots in the Habsburg Dynasty, while Faithfull's maternal grandmother was Jewish. Eva had been a ballerina for the Max Reinhardt Company during her early years, and danced in productions of works by the German theatrical duo Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. \n\nFaithfull's maternal great great uncle was Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, whose erotic novel, \"Venus in Furs,\" spawned the word \"masochism.\" In regard to her roots in the Austrian nobility, Faithfull discovered on the British television series \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" that the title was Ritter von Sacher-Masoch, the relative corresponding English title being that of Baronet, an inherited knighthood. \n\nShe spent some of her early life at the commune at Braziers Park, Oxfordshire, formed by Dr John Norman Glaister, where her father also lived and participated. Her parents divorced when she was six years old, after which she moved with her mother to Milman Road in Reading. Her primary school was in Brixton. Living in reduced circumstances, Faithfull's girlhood was marred by bouts of tuberculosis. She was a charitably subsidized (bursaried) pupil at St Joseph's Roman Catholic Convent School, Reading, where she was, for a time, a weekly boarder. While at St Joseph's, she was a member of the Progress Theatre's student group.\n\nFaithfull began her singing career in 1964, landing her first gigs as a folk music performer in coffeehouses. She soon began taking part in London's exploding social scene. In early 1964 she attended a Rolling Stones launch party with artist John Dunbar and met Andrew Loog Oldham, who discovered her. Her first major release, \"As Tears Go By\", was written and composed by Jagger, Keith Richards, and Oldham, and became a chart success. (The Rolling Stones recorded their own version one year later, which also became successful.) She then released a series of successful singles, including \"This Little Bird\", \"Summer Nights\", and \"Come and Stay With Me\". Faithfull married John Dunbar on 6 May 1965 in Cambridge with Peter Asher as the best man. The couple lived in a flat at 29 Lennox Gardens in Belgravia just off Knightsbridge, London SW1. On 10 November 1965, she gave birth to their son, Nicholas. She left her husband shortly after to live with Mick Jagger.\nIn 1966 she took Nicholas to stay with Brian Jones and Anita Pallenberg in London. During that time period, Faithfull started smoking marijuana and became best friends with Pallenberg. She also began a much publicised relationship with Mick Jagger that same year. The couple became notorious and largely part of the hip Swinging London scene. She was found wearing only a fur rug by police executing a drug search at Keith Richards's house in West Wittering, Sussex. In an interview 27 years later with A.M. Homes for \"Details\", Faithfull discussed her wilder days and admitted that the drug bust fur rug incident had ravaged her personal life: \"It destroyed me. To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising. A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.\" In 1968, Faithfull, by now addicted to cocaine, miscarried a daughter (whom she had named Corrina) while retreating to Jagger's country house in Ireland.\n\nFaithfull's involvement in Jagger's life would be reflected in some of the Rolling Stones's best known songs. \"Sympathy for the Devil\", featured on the 1968 album \"Beggars Banquet,\" was partially inspired by \"The Master and Margarita,\" written by Mikhail Bulgakov, a book to which Faithfull introduced Jagger. The song \"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\" on the 1969 album \"Let It Bleed,\" was supposedly written and composed about Faithfull; the songs \"Wild Horses\" and \"I Got the Blues\" on the 1971 album \"Sticky Fingers\" were also allegedly influenced by Faithfull, and she co-wrote \"Sister Morphine\". (The writing credit for the song was the subject of a protracted legal battle; the resolution of the case has Faithfull listed as co-author of the song.) In her autobiography, Faithfull said Jagger and Richards released it in their own names so that her agent did not collect all the royalties and proceeds from the song, especially as she was homeless and battling with heroin addiction at the time. Faithfull appeared in \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\" concert, giving a solo performance of \"Something Better\".\n\nFaithfull ended her relationship with Jagger in May 1970, and she lost custody of her son in that same year, which led to her attempting suicide. Faithfull's personal life went into decline, and her career went into a tailspin. She only made a few appearances, including a 1973 performance at NBC with David Bowie, singing Sonny & Cher's \"I Got You Babe\".\n\nFaithfull lived on London's Soho streets for two years, suffering from heroin addiction and anorexia nervosa. Friends intervened and enrolled her in an NHS drug programme, from which she could get her daily fix on prescription from a chemist. She failed at controlling or stabilising her addiction at that time. In 1971, producer Mike Leander found her on the streets and made an attempt to revive her career, producing part of her album \"Rich Kid Blues\". The album was shelved until 1985.\n\nSevere laryngitis, coupled with persistent drug abuse during this period, permanently altered Faithfull's voice, leaving it cracked and lower in pitch. While the new sound was praised as \"whisky soaked\" by some critics, journalist John Jones, of the \"Sunday Times\", wrote that she had \"permanently vulgarised her voice\". In 1975 she released the country-influenced record \"Dreamin' My Dreams\" (a.k.a. \"Faithless\"), which reached No.1 on the Irish Albums Chart. Faithfull moved into a squat without hot water or electricity in Chelsea with then-boyfriend Ben Brierly, of the punk band the Vibrators. She later shared flats in Chelsea and Regent's Park with Henrietta Moraes.\n\nFaithfull's career returned full force in 1979 (the same year she was arrested for marijuana possession in Norway) with the album \"Broken English\", one of her most critically hailed albums. The album was partially influenced by the punk explosion and her marriage to Brierly in the same year. In addition to the punk-pop sounds of the title track (which addressed terrorism in Europe, being dedicated to Ulrike Meinhof), the album also included \"Why D'Ya Do It?\", a punk-reggae song with aggressive lyrics adapted from a poem by Heathcote Williams. The musical structure of this song is complex; though on the surface hard rock, it is a tango in 4/4 time, with an opening electric guitar riff by Barry Reynolds in which beats 1 and 4 of each measure are accented on the up-beat, and beat 3 is accented on the down beat. Faithfull, in her autobiography, commented that her fluid yet rhythmic reading of Williams' lyric was \"an early form of rap\". \"Broken English\" was also the album which revealed the full extent of Faithfull's drinking and drug use and its effect on her singing voice, with the melodic vocals on her early records being replaced by a raucous, deep voice which helped capture the raw emotions expressed in the album's songs.\n\nFaithfull began living in New York after the release of the follow-up to \"Broken English\", \"Dangerous Acquaintances\", in 1981. Despite her comeback, she was still battling with addiction in the mid-1980s, at one point breaking her jaw tripping on a flight of stairs while under the influence. In another incident her heart stopped. A disastrous appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" was blamed on too many rehearsals, but it was suspected that drugs had caused her vocal cords to seize up. \"Rich Kid Blues\" (1985) was another collection of her early work combined with new recordings, a double record showcasing both the pop and rock 'n' roll facets of her output to date. In 1985, Faithfull performed \"Ballad of the Soldier's Wife\" on Hal Willner's tribute album \"\". Faithfull's restrained readings lent themselves to the material, and this collaboration informed several subsequent works.\n\nIn 1985, she was at the Hazelden Foundation Clinic in Minnesota for rehabilitation. She then received treatment at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. While living at a hotel in nearby Cambridge, Faithfull started an affair (while still married to Brierly) with a dual diagnosis (mentally ill and drug dependent) man, Howard Tose, who later committed suicide by jumping from a 14th floor window of the flat they shared. In 1987, Faithfull dedicated a \"thank you\" to Tose within the album package of \"Strange Weather\", on the back sleeve: \"To Howard Tose with love and thanks\". Faithfull's divorce from Brierly was also finalised that year. In 1995, she wrote and sang about Tose's death in \"Flaming September\" from the album \"A Secret Life\".\n\nIn 1987, Faithfull again reinvented herself, this time as a jazz and blues singer, on \"Strange Weather\", also produced by Willner. The album became her most critically lauded album of the decade. Coming full circle, the renewed Faithfull cut another recording of \"As Tears Go By\" for \"Strange Weather\", this time in a tighter, more gravelly voice. The singer confessed to a lingering irritation with her first hit. \"I always childishly thought that was where my problems started, with that damn song,\" she told Jay Cocks in \"Time\" magazine, but she came to terms with it as well as with her past. In a 1987 interview with Rory O'Connor of \"Vogue\", Faithfull declared, \"forty is the age to sing it, not seventeen.\" The album of covers was produced by Hal Willner after the two had spent numerous weekends listening to hundreds of songs from the annals of 20th-century music. They chose to record such diverse tracks as Bob Dylan's \"I'll Keep It with Mine\" and \"Yesterdays\", written by Broadway composers Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach. The work also includes tunes first made notable by such blues luminaries as Billie Holiday and Bessie Smith; Tom Waits wrote the title track. In 1988, Faithfull married writer and actor Giorgio Della Terza, but they divorced in 1991.\n\nWhen Roger Waters assembled an all-star cast of musicians to perform the rock opera \"The Wall\" live in Berlin in July 1990, Faithfull played the part of Pink's overprotective mother. Her musical career rebounded for the third time during the early 1990s with the live album \"Blazing Away,\" which featured Faithfull revisiting songs she had performed over the course of her career. \"Blazing Away\" was recorded at St. Ann's Cathedral in Brooklyn. The 13 selections include \"Sister Morphine\", a cover of Edith Piaf's \"Les Prisons du Roy\", and \"Why D'Ya Do It?\" from \"Broken English\". Alanna Nash of \"Stereo Review\" commended the musicians whom Faithfull had chosen to back her—longtime guitarist Reynolds was joined by former Band member Garth Hudson and pianist Dr. John. Nash was also impressed with the album's autobiographical tone, noting \"Faithfull's gritty alto is a cracked and halting rasp, the voice of a woman who's been to hell and back on the excursion fare which, of course, she has.\" The reviewer extolled Faithfull as \"one of the most challenging and artful of women artists,\" and \"Rolling Stone\" writer Fred Goodman asserted: \"\"Blazing Away\" is a fine retrospective – proof that we can still expect great things from this greying, jaded contessa.\"\n\n\"A Collection of Her Best Recordings\" was released in 1994 by Island Records to coincide with the release of the Faithfull autobiography; the two products originally shared the same cover art. It contained Faithfull's updated version of \"As Tears Go By\" from \"Strange Weather,\" several cuts from \"Broken English\" and \"A Child's Adventure\" and a song written by Patti Smith scheduled for inclusion on an Irish AIDS benefit album. This track, \"Ghost Dance\", suggested to Faithfull by a friend who later died of AIDS, was made with a trio of old acquaintances: Stones' drummer Charlie Watts and guitarist Ron Wood backed Faithfull's vocals on the song, while Keith Richards coproduced it. The retrospective album also featured one live track, \"Times Square\", from \"Blazing Away\" as well as a new Faithfull original, \"She\", penned with composer and arranger Angelo Badalamenti to be released the following year on \"A Secret Life\", with additional songs co written with Badalamenti. Faithfull also sang \"Love is Teasin,\" an Irish folk standard, with The Chieftains on their album The Long Black Veil, released in 1995. Faithfull sang a duet and recited text on the San Francisco band Oxbow's 1997 album Serenade in Red. Faithfull also sang interlude vocals on Metallica's song \"The Memory Remains\" from their 1997 album \"ReLoad\" and appeared in the song's music video; the track reached No. 28 in the U.S. (No.3 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart) and No.13 in the UK.\n\nAs her fascination with the music of Weimar-era Germany continued, Faithfull performed in \"The Threepenny Opera\" at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, playing Pirate Jenny. Her interpretation of the music led to a new album, \"Twentieth Century Blues\" (1996), which focused on the music of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht as well as Noël Coward, followed in 1998 by a recording of \"The Seven Deadly Sins\", with the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. A hugely successful concert and cabaret tour accompanied by Paul Trueblood at the piano, culminated in the filming, at the Montreal Jazz Festival, of the DVD \"Marianne Faithfull Sings Kurt Weill\".\n\nIn 1998 Faithfull released \"A Perfect Stranger: The Island Anthology\", a two-disc compilation that chronicled her years with Island Records. It featured tracks from her albums \"Broken English\", \"Dangerous Acquaintances\", \"A Child's Adventure\", \"Strange Weather\", \"Blazing Away\", and \"A Secret Life\", as well as several B sides and unreleased tracks.\n\nFaithfull's 1999 DVD \"Dreaming My Dreams\" contained material about her childhood and parents, with historical video footage going back to 1964 and interviews with the artist and several friends who have known her since childhood. The documentary included sections on her relationship with John Dunbar and Mick Jagger, and brief interviews with Keith Richards. It concluded with footage from a 30-minute live concert, originally broadcast on PBS for the series \"Sessions at West 54th\". That same year, she ranked 25th in \"VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll\".\n\nRoger Waters (Pink Floyd) wrote the song \"Incarceration of a Flower Child\" in 1968; it was never recorded by Pink Floyd. The song was eventually recorded by Marianne Faithfull on her 1999 album \"Vagabond Ways\".\n\nFaithfull released several albums in the 2000s that received positive critical response, beginning with \"Vagabond Ways\" (1999), which was produced and recorded by Mark Howard. It included collaborations with Daniel Lanois, Emmylou Harris, Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, and writer (and friend) Frank McGuinness. Later that year she sang \"Love Got Lost\" on Joe Jackson's \"Night and Day II\".\n\nHer renaissance continued with \"Kissin Time\", released in 2002. The album contained songs written with Blur, Beck, Billy Corgan, Jarvis Cocker, Dave Stewart, David Courts and the French pop singer Étienne Daho. On this record, she paid tribute to Nico (with \"Song for Nico\"), whose work she admired. The album also included an autobiographical song she co-wrote with Cocker, called \"Sliding Through Life on Charm\".\n\nIn 2005, she released \"Before the Poison\". The album was primarily a collaboration with PJ Harvey and Nick Cave, though Damon Albarn and Jon Brion also contributed. \"Before the Poison\" received mixed reviews from both \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Village Voice\". In 2005 she recorded (and co-produced) \"Lola R Forever\", a cover of the Serge Gainsbourg song \"Lola Rastaquouere\" with Sly & Robbie for the tribute album \"Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited\". In 2007, Faithfull collaborated with the British singer-songwriter, Patrick Wolf on the duet \"Magpie\" from his third album \"The Magic Position\" and wrote and recorded a new song for the French film \"Truands\" called \"A Lean and Hungry Look\" with Ulysse.\n\nIn March 2007 she returned to the stage with a touring show entitled \"Songs of Innocence and Experience\". Supported by a trio, the performance had a semi-acoustic feel and toured European theatres throughout the spring and summer. The show featured many songs she had not performed live before including \"Something Better\", the song she sang on \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\". The show also included the Harry Nilsson song \"Don't Forget Me\", \"Marathon Kiss\" from Vagabond Ways and a version of the traditional \"Spike Driver Blues\".\n\nArticles published at that time hinted Faithfull was looking to retirement and was hoping that money from \"Songs of the Innocence and Experience\" would enable her to live in comfort. She said: \"I'm not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I’m going to have to get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means I have to put away 10 per cent every year of my old age. I want to be in a position where I don’t have to work. I should have thought about this a long time ago but I didn’t.\" However, she still lived in her flat in Paris (located in one of the most expensive streets of the capital) and had a house in County Waterford, Ireland. Recording of \"Easy Come, Easy Go\" commenced in New York City on 6 December 2007; the album was produced by Hal Willner who had previously recorded \"Strange Weather\" in 1997. A version of Morrissey's \"Dear God Please Help Me\" from his 2006 album, \"Ringleader of the Tormentors\" is one of the songs featured. In March 2009, she performed \"The Crane Wife 3\" on \"The Late Show\". In late March, she began the Easy Come, Easy Go tour, which took her to France, Germany, Austria, New York City, Los Angeles and London.\n\nOn 16 April 2009, while preparing to board a British Airways flight at London's Gatwick Airport bound for a concert appearance in Bologna, François Ravard, accompanying Faithfull, was detained and then later arrested. In a statement, British Airways said: \"A male customer became aggressive and abusive at check-in when he was refused travel on a flight from Gatwick to Bologna. He appeared to be intoxicated on arrival at check-in. In such circumstances, an assessment is made as to whether the passenger is fit to travel. When he was refused travel, he became physically and verbally abusive. Police were called and he was arrested. Such behaviour will not be tolerated.\" Faithfull, however, had not been drinking and was allowed to board. The pair was flying to Italy on a leg of her world tour promoting \"Easy Come, Easy Go\". According to her spokesperson, \"Marianne was at Gatwick airport but was not involved in any way in the situation that occurred and she managed to travel on to Bologna as planned. Her gig tonight there will go ahead as planned, and Francois travelled from Britain to join her yesterday. Marianne hadn't been drinking at the time of the incident and she does not drink alcohol. She is enjoying life and loving it as she is sober and clean.\" \n\nIn April 2009, Faithfull stated that although Ravard was still her manager, their 15-year relationship had ended some months ago. Faithfull said, \"I'm all right but I have had a bit of an adventure – my relationship broke up. I felt very betrayed and lonely. I am much, much better now, but it is not good for your self-esteem.\" On 3 May 2009, she was featured on \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" and interviewed by Anthony Mason in the \"Sunday Profile\" segment. Both in-studio and on-the-street (New York City) interview segments with Faithfull and Mason were interspersed with extensive biographical and musical footage.\n\nIn November, Faithfull was interviewed by Jennifer Davies on World Radio Switzerland, where she described the challenges of being stereotyped as a \"mother, or the pure wife\". Because of this, she insisted, it has been hard to maintain a long career as a female artist, which, she said, gave her empathy for Amy Winehouse when they met recently.\n\nIn 2010, she was honoured with the Icon of the Year award from Q magazine.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, Faithfull released her 18th studio album \"Horses and High Heels\" in mainland Europe with mixed reviews from the most important media.\n\nOn 7 May 2011 she appeared on BBC Radio 2's \"Graham Norton Show\". She reunited with Metallica in December 2011 for their 30th anniversary celebration at the Fillmore where she performed \"The Memory Remains\".\n\nIn 2012, Faithfull recorded a cover version of a Stevie Nicks track from the Fleetwood Mac album \"Tusk\" as part of a Fleetwood Mac tribute project. The track \"Angel\" was released on 14 August 2012 as part of the tribute album \"Just Tell Me That You Want Me\".\n\nOn 22 June 2013, she made a sell-out concert appearance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with jazz musician Bill Frisell playing guitar, as a part of Meltdown Festival curated by Yoko Ono.\n\nIn September 2014, Faithfull released an album of all-new material, titled \"Give My Love to London.\" She started a 12-month 50th anniversary tour at the end of 2014.\n\nDuring a webchat hosted by \"The Guardian\" on 1 February 2016, Faithfull revealed plans to release a live album from her 50th Anniversary tour. She also had ideas for a follow-up for \"Give My Love to London,\" but had no intention of recording new material for at least a year and a half.\n\nA new album from Faithfull, which she titled \"Negative Capability,\" was slated to be released sometime in 2018, via BMG. Promotions for the album described it as channeling Keats and Shakespeare, having a folky feel, and including collaborations with Nick Cave, Ed Harcourt, and Mark Lanegan. It was reported, in the \"Daily Beast,\" that \"Negative Capability\" would be released on 2 November 2018.\n\nIn 1999, Faithfull ranked 25th on VH1's 100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll.\n\nOn 4 November 2007, the European Film Academy announced that Faithfull had received a nomination for Best Actress, for her role as Maggie in \"Irina Palm\". At the 20th annual European Film Awards ceremony held in Berlin, on 1 December 2007, Faithfull lost to Helen Mirren.\n\nOn 5 March 2009, Faithfull received the World Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement at the 2009 Women's World Awards. \"Marianne's contribution to the arts over a 45-year career including 18 studio albums as a singer, songwriter and interpreter, and numerous appearances on stage and screen is now being acknowledged with this special award.\" The award was presented in Vienna, with ceremonies televised in over 40 countries on 8 March 2009 as part of International Women's Day.\n\nOn 23 March 2011, Faithfull was awarded the Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, one of France's highest cultural honours.\n\nFaithfull's touring and work schedule has been repeatedly interrupted by health problems. In late 2004 she called off the European leg of a world tour, promoting \"Before The Poison\" after collapsing on stage in Milan, and was hospitalised for exhaustion. The tour resumed later and included a US leg in 2005. In September 2006, she again called off a concert tour, this time after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The following month, she underwent surgery in France and no further treatment was necessary owing to the tumour having been caught at a very early stage. Less than two months after she declared having beaten the disease, Faithfull made her public statement of full recovery.\n\nIn October 2007, Faithfull stated she suffered from hepatitis C on the UK television programme \"This Morning\", and that she had first been diagnosed with the condition 12 years before. She discusses both the cancer and hepatitis diagnoses in further depth in her second memoir, \"Memories, Dreams and Reflections.\" On 27 May 2008, Faithfull released the following blog posting on her MySpace page, with the headline \"Tour Dates Cancelled\" and credited to FR Management – the company operated by her boyfriend/manager François Ravard: \"Due to general mental, physical and nervous exhaustion doctors have ordered Marianne Faithfull to immediately cease all work activities and rehabilitate. The treatment and recovery should last around six months.\"\n\nIn August 2013, Faithfull was forced to cancel a string of concerts in the US and Lebanon following a back injury while on holiday in California.\n\nOn 30 May 2014, Faithfull suffered a broken hip after a fall while on holiday on the Greek island of Rhodes and underwent surgery. Afterwards, an infection formed where the prosthetic was placed, causing Faithfull to cancel or postpone parts of her 50th Anniversary tour for additional surgery and rehabilitation.\n\n\nIn addition to her music career, Faithfull has had a career as an actress in theatre, television and film.\n\nHer first professional theatre appearance was in a 1967 stage adaptation of Chekhov's \"Three Sisters\", at the Royal Court Theatre, London, in which she played Irina, co-starring with Glenda Jackson and Avril Elgar. Before that she played herself in Jean-Luc Godard's film \"Made in U.S.A.\" Faithfull has also appeared in the 1967 film \"I'll Never Forget What's'isname\" alongside Orson Welles (where she notably became the first person to say \"fuck\" in a mainstream studio picture), in the French television film \"Anna\", starring Anna Karina (in which Faithfull sang Serge Gainsbourg's \"Hier ou Demain\"), as a leather-clad motorcyclist in the 1968 French film \"La Motocyclette\" (English titles: \"Girl on a Motorcycle\" and \"Naked Under Leather\") opposite Alain Delon, and in Kenneth Anger's 1969 film \"Lucifer Rising\", in which she played Lilith. In 1969, Faithfull played Ophelia opposite Nicol Williamson's title character in \"Hamlet\", directed by Tony Richardson and featuring Anthony Hopkins as Claudius.\n\nHer stage work also included Edward Bond's \"Early Morning\" at the Royal Court Theatre, London, in which she played a lesbian Florence Nightingale, \"The Collector\" at St Martin's Theatre in the West End opposite Simon Williams, \"Mad Dog\" at Hampstead Theatre opposite Denholm Elliott, \"A Patriot for Me\" by \"John Osborne\", at the Palace Theatre, Watford and the role of Lizzie Curry in N. Richard Nash's \"The Rainmaker\", which toured the UK and in which Faithfull's co-star was Peter Gilmore. Other film roles in the 1970s included Sophy Kwykwer in Stephen Weeks's \"Ghost Story\" (AKA \"Madhouse Mansion\"), released on a newly mastered DVD in the UK in 2009, and Helen Rochefort in \"Assault on Agathon\".\n\nHer television acting in the late 1960s and early 1970s included \"The Door of Opportunity\" (1970) with Ian Ogilvy, adapted from W. Somerset Maugham's story, followed by August Strindberg's \"The Stronger\" (1971) with Britt Ekland, and \"Terrible Jim Fitch\" (1971) by James Leo Herlihy, which once more paired Faithfull with Nicol Williamson.\n\nIn 1993, she played the role of Pirate Jenny in \"The Threepenny Opera\" at the Gate Theatre in Dublin. Later she performed Kurt Weill's \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" with the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, a CD of which was released in 1998.\n\nShe has played both God and the Devil. She appeared as God in two guest appearances in the British sitcom \"Absolutely Fabulous\" opposite friend Jennifer Saunders, with another close friend, Anita Pallenberg, playing the Devil. In 2004 and 2005, she played the Devil in William Burroughs' and Tom Waits' musical, \"The Black Rider\", directed by Robert Wilson, which opened at London's Barbican Theatre, toured to San Francisco, but from which she was forced to withdraw prior to performances at the Sydney Festival, owing to exhaustion.\n\nIn 2001 Faithfull appeared with Lucy Russell and Lambert Wilson in C.S. Leigh's \"Far From China\". She has also appeared in Patrice Chéreau's \"Intimacy\" (2001) and, in 2004, in Jose Hayot's \"Nord-Plage\". Faithfull appeared as Empress Maria Theresa in Sofia Coppola's 2006 biopic, \"Marie Antoinette\". She starred in the film \"Irina Palm\", released at the Berlinale film festival in 2007. Faithfull plays the central role of Maggie, a 60-year-old widow who becomes a sex worker to pay for medical treatment for her ill grandson.\n\nFaithfull lent her voice to the 2008 film \"\", although this was recorded several years earlier when the project was still titled \"Alone in the Dark\". She has appeared in the 2008 feature documentary by Nik Sheehan on Brion Gysin and the dreamachine, entitled FLicKeR.\n\nIn 2008, Faithfull toured readings of Shakespeare's sonnets, drawing on the \"Dark Lady\" sequence. Her accompanist was the cellist Vincent Ségal.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012 Faithfull had supporting roles in the films \"Faces in the Crowd\" and \"Belle du Seigneur\".\n\nFaithfull starred in a production of Kurt Weill's \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" at Landestheater Linz, Austria. The production ran from October 2012 to January 2013.\n\nOn 18 September 2013, Faithfull was featured in the genealogy documentary series, \"Who Do You Think You Are?\", tracing her family's roots, in particular her mother's side of the family in pre World War II Austria.\n\n\n\n"}

On August 18, 2000, a federal jury found EPA guilty of violating the civil rights of Coleman-Adebayo on the basis of race, sex, color and a hostile work environment, under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Her experience inspired passage of the Notification and Federal Employee Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (No FEAR Act).\n\nDuring the legal proceedings, Coleman-Adebayo remained employed at the EPA. When she was diagnosed with hypertension, the agency agreed to let her work from home. After five years of telecommuting and another lawsuit, the EPA ordered Coleman-Adebayo to return to the office, placing her on unpaid leave when she did not comply.\n\nColeman-Adebayo is a founder and leader of the No FEAR Coalition and EPA Employees Against Racial Discrimination. Through her leadership the No FEAR Coalition, working closely with Representative James Sensenbrenner, organized a successful grass-roots campaign and secured passage of the \"Notification of Federal Employees Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act,\" the first Civil Rights Law of the 21st Century. The Act was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2002.\n\nColeman-Adebayo currently serves on the Board of Directors of the National Whistleblower Center, a nonpartisan, nonprofit, advocacy group dedicated to protecting the rights of employee whistleblowers. \"Good Housekeeping\" presented her with its Women in Government award in 2003. Her first book, \"No Fear: A Whistleblower's Triumph Over Corruption and Retaliation at the EPA\" was published in September 2011 by Lawrence Hill Books.\n\nAs of April 2015, she also serves on the Green Shadow Cabinet of the United States as \"Director of Governmental Transparency and Accountability\".\n\nIn June 2015, Coleman-Adebayo endorsed Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein while speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.\n\n"}

{"id": "923203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=923203", "title": "Norris Bradbury", "text": "Norris Bradbury\n\nNorris Edwin Bradbury (30 May 1909 – 20 August 1997), was an American physicist who served as Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory for 25 years from 1945 to 1970. He succeeded Robert Oppenheimer, who personally chose Bradbury for the position of director after working closely with him on the Manhattan Project during World War II. Bradbury was in charge of the final assembly of \"the Gadget\", detonated in July 1945 for the Trinity test.\n\nBradbury took charge at Los Alamos at a difficult time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor and there was a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay, and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.\n\nIn the 1950s Bradbury oversaw the development of thermonuclear weapons, although a falling out with Edward Teller over the priority given to their development led to the creation of a rival nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In later years, he branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science, and during the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory developed the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The Bradbury Science Museum is named in his honor.\n\nNorris Bradbury was born in Santa Barbara, California, on 30 May 1909, one of four children of Edwin Pearly and his wife Elvira née Clausen. One sister died as an infant, and the family adopted twins Bobby and Betty, both of whom served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. Bradbury was educated at Hollywood High School and Chaffey High School in Ontario, California, graduating at the age of 16. He then attended Pomona College in Claremont, California, from which he graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in chemistry in 1929. This earned him membership of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. At Pomona, he met Lois Platt, an English Literature major who was the sister of his college roommate. They were married in 1933, and had three sons, James, John, and David.\n\nBradbury became interested in physics, and did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a teaching fellow from 1929 to 1931, and then a Whiting Foundation fellow from 1931 to 1932. He submitted a PhD thesis on \"Studies on the mobility of gaseous ions\" under the supervision of Leonard B. Loeb, and was awarded a National Research Council fellowship.\n\nAs well as supervising Bradbury's thesis, Loeb, who had served as a naval reservist during World War I, encouraged Bradbury to apply for a commission as a naval reservist. Bradbury's commission as an ensign was signed by Lieutenant Commander Chester W. Nimitz, who was the head of the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps at Berkeley at the time.\n\nAfter two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bradbury became an assistant professor of physics at Stanford University in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became an expert on the electrical conductivity of gases, the properties of ions, and the behavior of atmospheric electricity, publishing in journals including the \"Physical Review\", \"Journal of Applied Physics\", \"Journal of Chemical Physics\", and the \"Journal of Atmospheric Electricity and Terrestrial Magnetism\". He invented the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter, a type of electrical ion gate, widely used in mass spectrometry in both time-of-flight mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers.\n\nBradbury was called up for service in World War II in early 1941, although the Navy allowed him to stay at Stanford until the end of the academic year. He was then sent to the Naval Proving Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia, to work on external ballistics. Already working at Dahlgren were Loeb and Commander Deak Parsons.\nIn June 1944, Bradbury received orders from Parsons, who was now the Deputy Director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, to report to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Parsons explained that he needed Bradbury to work on the explosive lenses required by an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Bradbury was less than enthusiastic about the prospect, but he was a naval officer, and ultimately agreed to go.\n\nAt Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, which put him in charge of the implosion field test program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.\n\nIn March 1945, Oppenheimer created Project Alberta under Parsons to carry out the Manhattan Project's ultimate mission: the preparation and delivery of nuclear weapons in combat. Bradbury was transferred to Project Alberta to head the Fat Man assembly group. In July 1945, Bradbury supervised the preparation of \"the Gadget\", as the bomb was known, at the Trinity nuclear test. \"For me to say\", Bradbury later recalled, \"I had any deep emotional thoughts about Trinity... I didn't. I was just damned pleased that it went off.\"\n\nOppenheimer submitted his resignation as Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, but remained until a successor could be found. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted someone with both a solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who liked the fact that as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis.\n\nParsons arranged for Bradbury to be quickly discharged from the Navy, which awarded him the Legion of Merit for his wartime services. He remained in the Naval Reserve, though, ultimately retiring in 1961 with the rank of captain. On 16 October 1945, there was a ceremony at Los Alamos at which Groves presented the laboratory with the Army-Navy \"E\" Award, and presented Oppenheimer with a certificate of appreciation. Bradbury became the laboratory's second director the following day.\n\nThe first months of Bradbury's directorship were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It soon became clear that this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.\n\nMost of the scientists at Los Alamos were eager to return to their laboratories and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had left, but a talented core remained. Darol Froman became head of Robert Bacher's G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, John H. Manley for Physics, George Placzek for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance. The number of personnel at Los Alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation. To make matters worse, the water pipe to Los Alamos froze and the water had to be supplied by tanker trucks. Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear tests in the Pacific.\nBradbury pushed continued development of nuclear weapons to take them from laboratory devices to production models. There were numerous improvements that could make them more safe, reliable and easy to store and handle, and make more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel. While Bradbury gave priority to improved fission weapons, research still continued on \"Alarm Clock\", a boosted nuclear weapon, and the \"Super\", a thermonuclear weapons design. The new fission designs were tested during Operation Sandstone in 1948. The Mark 4 nuclear bomb became the first nuclear weapon to be mass-produced on an assembly line.\n\nAs the future became more certain, Bradbury began looking for a new site for the laboratory away from the crowded town center. In 1948, Bradbury submitted a proposal to the Atomic Energy Commission for a new $107 million facility on the South Mesa, linked to the town by a new bridge over the canyon.\n\nAll this time, Bradbury remained nominally a professor in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University to terminate the contract three months after the end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.\n\nBy 1951, the laboratory had come up with the Teller-Ulam design, and thermonuclear tests were conducted during Operation Greenhouse. Tensions between Bradbury and Edward Teller over the degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development led to the creation of a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.\n\nIn later years, Bradbury branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science. During the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory worked on Project Rover, developing the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The laboratory demonstrated the feasibility and value of nuclear rocket propulsion.\n\nFor many years, Bradbury was responsible for much of the administration of the town of Los Alamos. The town established impressive health and education facilities. Eventually the new technical area was built outside the town, and on 18 February 1957 the security gates were taken down. Finally, the town became an incorporated community and the director's civic responsibilities ended.\n\nIn 1966, Bradbury was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service for \"exceptionally meritorious civilian service to the Armed Forces and the United States of America in a position of great responsibility as director, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory\". His citation went on to say that \"The outstanding international reputation of the Los Alamos Laboratory is directly attributable to his exceptional leadership. The United States is indebted to Dr. Bradbury and his laboratory, to a very large degree, for our present nuclear capability.\" He also received the Enrico Fermi Award in 1970.\n\nBradbury retired as director of Los Alamos Laboratory in 1970. His successor, Harold Agnew, invited him to become a senior consultant, but Bradbury declined the offer, although he did serve as a consultant for other government agencies, including the National Academy of Sciences, and as a member of the boards of the Los Alamos Medical Center, the First National Bank of Santa Fe, the Los Alamos YMCA and the Santa Fe Neurological Society.\n\nIn 1969 the Governor of New Mexico, David Cargo, appointed Bradbury as a regent of the University of New Mexico, but this was a turbulent time for the university. In response to the Kent State Shootings in May 1970, students and antiwar activist Jane Fonda marched on the home of Ferrel Heady, the President of the University of New Mexico. When he refused to meet with them, the students called a strike. Classes were cancelled, rallies were held and students occupied the Student Union Building. Cargo called in the New Mexico National Guard to remove them, and eleven people were bayoneted. Cargo's successor, Bruce King, replaced Bradbury and another regent.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while chopping firewood. Gangrene set in, and his right leg was amputated below the knee. It spread to his left leg, and part of his left foot was amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on 20 August 1997. He was survived by his wife Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.\n\n"}

Prima ballerina at La Scala Theatre Ballet, and the Chicago Ballet, she was also the \"première danseuse\" at the Teatro di San Carlo and the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nGalli was born in Naples, where her father was a lawyer. She studied dance at the Teatro di San Carlo's ballet school, becoming the company's \"première danseuse\" at the age of 14. When she was offered the première danseuse position at La Scala Theatre Ballet, the family moved to Milan. She debuted in 1910, at the age of eighteen, dancing in \"Pietro Micca\" and \"Ballo Excelsior\" of Luigi Manzotti.\n\nIn 1911, her father and two brothers escorted Galli to Genoa, from where Galli and her mother proceeded to Chicago, US. Galli performed first as soloist, and then as prima ballerina of the Chicago Ballet. In 1913, she was hired by the Metropolitan Opera House. Though she sported a petite figure, characterized as elfish, Galli demonstrated a rigorous technique and performed powerful pirouettes, continuing to dance there until 1931. Her partner at the Met was Giuseppe Bonfiglio. Her studies in America were under Luigi Albertieri.\n\nIn 1919, she began teaching dance at the Met, also serving as ballet mistress until 1935.

Her first break came in 1985 when she was cast on the CBC's first nations TV series \"Spirit Bay\", and later, in 1997, she found a role on the CBC's TV series \"The Rez\".\n\nShe was named chancellor of Brock University in July 2015, the institution's first female and first aboriginal chancellor.\n\nShirley Cheechoo was born in 1952 in Eastmain, Quebec, and grew up in Moose Factory and Hearst, Ontario. Shirley spent her early life on traplines with her parents and brothers, but at the age of nine was sent to a residential school, Shingwauk Residential School, now known as Algoma University College. At this school Cheechoo, like many other residential school survivors, experienced violence and abuse and was told that \"her parents would die if she ran away.\" After leaving school at fifteen, Cheechoo experienced problems with substance abuse, but eventually, she turned her life around and began to work in film and theatre to explore themes of healing and survivance post-trauma. Her experiences at a residential school and her road to healing are documented in her stage play 1991 \"Path with No Moccasins.\"\n\nShirley attended art classes at the Manitou Arts Foundation during the summer of 1966.\n\nShirley founded De-ba-jeh-mu-jig theatre, which developed out of the children's theatre. After starting the theatre company, partner Blake Debassige, a visual artist, served on the board of directors and as president of the board during the early years of De-Ba-Jeh-Mu-Jig theatre group.\n\nDuring her time at Debaj, Shirley fulfilled the role of artistic director, president of the board of directors, as well as fulfilling much of the administrative roles, actor, and playwright.\n\nShirley is the first First Nations woman to \"write, produce, direct, and act in a feature length film from Canada\".\n\nShirley first gained national attention with \"Path With No Moccasins\". Her directorial debut was with a short film called \"Silent Tears\", which won several film festival awards for Best Short Film and was \"screened at the 1998Sundance Film Festival.\"\n\nHer first feature film was \"Backroads\", a journey into the harsh contemporary life of Cree women. The movie was financed and executive-produced by Offline Entertainment Group.\n\nShirley realized that she could \"ease a pain or raise an issue with her film work\" and so dedicated herself to creating film by enrolling in writing classes, director's labs, acting workshops and film schools.\n\nMuch of her art is based on biographical elements. \"Path With No Moccasins\" gave Shirley the opportunity to \"speak about her life and the struggle to retain her identity, and Cree heritage\". \"Silent Tears\" chronicles the events of a \"harsh winter trip with her parents to a northern trap line when she was eight years old\".\n\nIn order to promote Aboriginal artists, Shirley and Blake Debassige co-own Kasheese Studios art gallery. She is also the president of Spoken Song film production company and founded the Weengushk Film Institute on Manitoulin Island that will train, develop and guide independent filmmakers.\n\nHer artwork is inspired by Woodlands School, which is a concept given birth by Norval Morrisseau. Her art has been exhibited around the world, and her commissions include:\n\n\nShe is a mentor to many in the Native arts community and one of Canada's most well-known and respected artists. She visits other communities and schools and holds workshops. On the topic of visiting schools to host acting and playwrighting workshops, Shirley has said\n\nthe kids that come into the theatre, into the drama workshops, are the kids that I pick. I feel that they need some kind of self-esteem, and drama does it. Anything in the arts gives these kids a lot of self-esteem ... the arts are really important for children and they're not taught in the schools\n\nShirley is concerned with Indigenous people's complacency with \"small advancements and the slight changes that appear when it comes to equality and respect\" and believes that \"We must continue to fight in the most positive way to try and find a level playing field for Indigenous people to work, live, and create in the main\".\n\nIn February 2008, Shirley was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award in the area of art by the National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation. She was also awarded the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Award in 2013 to recognize her commitment to education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "406364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=406364", "title": "Sir Kay", "text": "Sir Kay\n\nIn Arthurian legend, Sir Kay (, Middle Welsh Kei or Cei; ; French: \"Keu\"; French Romance: \"Queux\"; Old French: \"Kès\" or \"Kex\") is Sir Ector's son and King Arthur's foster brother and later seneschal, as well as one of the first Knights of the Round Table. In later literature he is known for his acid tongue and bullying, boorish behavior, but in earlier accounts he was one of Arthur's premier warriors. Along with Bedivere, with whom he is frequently associated, Kay is one of the earliest characters associated with Arthur.\n\nCai or Cei is one of the earliest characters to be associated with the Arthurian cycle, appearing in a number of early Welsh texts, including \"Culhwch ac Olwen\", \"Geraint fab Erbin, Iarlles y Ffynnon, \"Peredur fab Efrawg\", Breuddwyd Rhonabwy, Pa Gur yv y Porthaur\" and the Welsh Triads. His father is given as Cynyr, his son as Garanwyn and his daughter as Kelemon.\n\nBefore Cai's birth, Cynyr Ceinfarfog prophesied that his son's heart would be eternally cold, that he would be exceptionally stubborn and that no one would be able to brave fire or water like him. Cai is attributed with a number of further superhuman abilities, including the ability to go nine days and nine nights without the need to breathe or to sleep, the ability to grow as \"tall as the tallest tree in the forest if he pleased\" and the ability to radiate supernatural heat from his hands. Furthermore, it is impossible to cure a wound from Cai's sword. Cai is killed by Gwyddawg fab Menestyr, who is in turn killed in vengeance by Arthur.\n\nOne of the earliest direct reference to Cai can be found in the 10th-century poem \"Pa Gur\", in which Arthur recounts the feats and achievements of his knights so as to gain entrance to a fortress guarded by Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr, the titular porter. The poem concerns itself largely with Cai's exploits:\n\nCulhwch's father, King Cilydd son of Celyddon, loses his wife Goleuddydd after a difficult childbirth. When he remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother's attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful Olwen, daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin Arthur. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in Celliwig in Cornwall and asks for support and assistance. Cai is the first knight to volunteer to assist Culhwch in his quest, promising to stand by his side until Olwen is found. A further five knights join them in their mission. They travel onwards until they come across the \"fairest of the castles of the world\", and meet Ysbaddaden's shepherd brother, Custennin. They learn that the castle belongs to Ysbaddaden, that he stripped Custennin of his lands and murdered the shepherd's twenty-three children out of cruelty. Custennin set up a meeting between Culhwch and Olwen, and the maiden agrees to lead Culhwch and his companions to Ysbadadden's castle. Cai pledges to protect the twenty-fourth son, Goreu with his life. The knights attack the castle by stealth, killing the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and enter the giant's hall. Upon their arrival, Ysbaddaden attempts to kill Culhwch with a poison dart, but is outwitted and wounded, first by Bedwyr, then by the enchanter Menw, and finally by Culhwch himself. Eventually, Ysbaddaden relents, and agrees to give Culhwch his daughter on the condition that he completes a number of impossible tasks (\"anoethau\"), including hunting the Twrch Trwyth and recovering the exalted prisoner Mabon ap Modron.\n\nCai is a prominent character throughout the tale and is responsible for completing a number of the tasks; he kills Wrnach the Giant, rescues Mabon ap Modron from his watery prison and retrieving the hairs of Dillus the Bearded. However, when Arthur makes a satirical englyn about Cai, he grows angry and hostile towards the king, ultimately abandoning the quest and his companions. The narrative tells us that Cai would \"have nothing to do with Arthur from then on, not when the latter was waning in strength or when his men were being killed.\" As a result, he did not take part in the hunt for Twrch Trwyth.\n\nIn the Life of St. Cadoc (c.1100) Bedwyr is alongside Arthur and Cai in dealing with King Gwynllyw of Gwynllwg's abduction of St. Gwladys from her father's court in Brycheiniog. Cai appears prominently in the early Welsh version of \"Tristan and Isolde\", in which he assists the two lovers and is himself infatuated with a maiden named Golwg Hafddydd, and in the early dialogue poems relating to Melwas' abduction of Gwenhwyfar. The context suggests that Cai is rescuing the queen from the otherwordly suitor, and may imply a romantic relationship between Cai and Gwenhwyfar.\nThe Welsh Triads name Cai as one of the \"Three Battle-Diademed Men of the Island of Britain\" alongside Drystan mab Tallwch and Hueil mab Caw. In the \"Triads of the Horses\", his horse is named as Gwyneu gwddf hir (Gwyneu of the Long Neck). According to tradition, Cai is intimately associated with the old Roman fort of Caer Gai.\n\nIn the Welsh Romances (specifically \"Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain\" and \"Peredur son of Efrawg\"), Cai assumes the same boorish role he takes in the continental romances. However, manuscripts for these romances date to well after Chrétien de Troyes, meaning that Cai as he appears there may owe more to Chrétien's version of the character than to the indigenous Welsh representation.\n\nKay is ubiquitous in Arthurian literature but he rarely serves as anything but a foil for other characters. Though he manipulates the king to get his way, his loyalty to Arthur is usually unquestioned. In the Vulgate Cycle, the Post-Vulgate and Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", Kay's father Ector adopts the infant Arthur after Merlin takes him away from his birth parents, Uther and Igraine. Ector raises him and Kay as brothers, but Arthur's parentage is revealed when he draws the Sword in the Stone at a tournament in London. Arthur, serving as squire to the newly knighted Kay, is locked out of the house and cannot get to his brother's sword and uses the Sword in the Stone to replace it. Kay shows his characteristic opportunism when he tries to claim it was he that pulled the sword from the stone, making him the true King of the Britons, but he relents and admits it was Arthur. He becomes one of the first Knights of the Round Table and serves his foster-brother throughout his life.\n\nKay's father is called Ector in later literature, but the Welsh accounts name him as Cynyr Fork-Beard. In \"Erec and Enide\", Chrétien de Troyes mentions he had a son called Gronosis, who was versed in evil, while the Welsh give him a son and daughter named Garanwyn and Celemon. Romance rarely deals with Kay's love life, an exception being Girart d'Amiens' \"Escanor\", which details his love for Andrivete of Northumbria, whom he must defend from her uncle's political machinations before they can marry.\n\nKay and Bedivere appear in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", and aid Arthur in defeating the Giant of Mont Saint-Michel. Geoffrey makes Kay the count of Anjou and Arthur's steward, an office he holds in most later literature.\n\nIn the works of Chrétien de Troyes, Kay assumes the characteristics he is most associated with today. He retains his hot-headedness and fiery temper from Welsh literature, but he is more or less an incompetent braggart. Chrétien uses him as a scoffer and a troublemaker; a foil for heroic knights like Lancelot, Ywain, or Gawain. He mocks the chivalric courtesy of Sir Calogrenant in \"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\", and he tricks Arthur into allowing him to try to save Guinevere from Maleagant in \"Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart\", which ends in his humiliating defeat. In \"Perceval, the Story of the Grail\", Sir Kay grows angry with Perceval's naïveté and slaps a maiden who says he will become a great knight; Perceval avenges her later when he breaks Kay's shoulder. Wolfram von Eschenbach, who tells the same story in his \"Parzival\", asks his audience not to judge Kay too harshly, as his sharp words actually serve to maintain courtly order.\n\nScholars have pointed out that Kay's scornful, overly boastful character never makes him a clown, a coward or a traitor, except in the Grail romance \"Perlesvaus\", where he murders Arthur's son Loholt and joins up with the king's enemies. This strange work is an anomaly, however, and Kay's portrayal tends to range from merely cruel and malicious, as in the \"Roman de Yder\" or Hartmann von Aue's \"Iwein\" to humorously derisive and even endearing, as in \"Durmart le Gallois\" and \"Escanor\".\n\nDespite his ubiquity, Kay's death is not frequently dealt with. In Welsh literature, it is mentioned he was killed by Gwyddawg and avenged by Arthur. In Geoffrey of Monmouth and the \"Alliterative Morte Arthure\", he is killed in the war against the Roman emperor Lucius, while the Vulgate Cycle has him die in France, also in battle against the Romans.\n\nAccording to Malory's version of Book 5, Kay did not die in the war against Rome, but survived and later was part of a party sent to try and retrieve Excalibur's sacred scabbard, prior to the Battle of Camlann. He was also among the few people who survived the battle of Camlann, although it is ambiguous as to how he survived. In later interpretations it is suggested that he never participated in that battle.\n\n\n"}
