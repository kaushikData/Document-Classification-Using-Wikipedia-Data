His Montana birth certificate lists him as being 13/16th Cree by blood-quantum, but one of his full sisters, Shirley, is listed as 16/16ths. He is a former Department Head (2007–2010) of Indian Fine Arts at the First Nations University of Canada in Regina, Saskatchewan and former Chair (1999–2007) of Native American Studies, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. He is Professor Emeritus at the University of Lethbridge and University of Regina.\n\nBorn in 1948 on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Browning, Montana, Young Man is the ninth child of fifteen brothers and sisters. His father Joseph Young Man White Horse (Sau-sti-qua-ńis) and mother Lillian Katherine Boushie were both Cree and fluent in Cree and English.\n\nYoung Man's paternal Cree grandmother Theresa Ground Woman Big Springs spoke Cree only and was married to Don't Talk Many White Horses, a Blackfeet Indian man. Since Don't Talk was deaf, he went by the nickname Deafy (pronoun: Deé-fee). Deafy was stricken with scarlet fever as a child in the late 19th century, as many Blackfeet children of his generation were, rendering him mute. Theresa and Deafy communicated their entire married lives using Indian sign-language. Theresa outlived Deafy to the approximate age of 113 years. Young Man's maternal grandfather Edward Boushie was Cree/Métis and Edward's wife Eliza was also Cree from the Erminskin Reserve in Hobbema, Alberta.\n\nYoung Man grew up in East Glacier Park, Montana and spoke Cree as a child. Like nearly all Indian children of his generation, when Alfred was six years old he and his siblings were taken away to Cut Bank Boarding School, a Bureau of Indian Affairs government school located a short distance north of Browning. Physical punishment was an everyday occurrence and Cree and Blackfeet traditions and customs were illegal to practise under US government law. Young Man stayed in government Indian boarding schools at various times and places until he was 20 years old when he went to the Slade School of Art in London, England in 1968 which was the first time ever that he attended an all-white school for any length of time. Alfred's memory of the Cree language is sparse and he speaks and understands only a little.\n\nYoung Man attended the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico (1963–1968) where the German painter Fritz Scholder was his painting teacher for two years (1966–68). The IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts retains a considerable number of Young Man's paintings in its collection from the five years he spent there. Young Man went on to study painting, film history and photography at the Slade School of Fine Arts, University College London in London, England for four years (1968–72) where he met many famous and influential artists and musicians, amongst these were Pop artist's Richard Hamilton and David Hockney who were visiting artists and who stopped by his painting studio on random occasions. While at the Slade, Young Man was tutored and mentored for two years (1970–1972) by Bernard Cohen; another tutor was landscape painter William Townsend (1909–1973). The director of the Slade during Young Man's time at the school was Sir William Coldstream, founder of the Euston Road School. While in London, Young Man met Jimi Hendrix just a month before the famous rock musician died in September 1970, introduced to Hendrix by Steven Stills of CSN&Y who was cutting what Stills described as his pink giraffe album in a sound studio in London.\n\nYoung Man earned his M.A. at the University of Montana (1972–74) where George Longfish (Seneca-Tuscarora) was his teacher and mentor in the Graduate Program in American Indian Art. He graduated with his doctor of philosophy degree (Ph.D.) in Anthropology from Rutgers University in New Jersey in 1997 where he studied anthropology as a student of William Powers.\n\nYoung Man has been an art teacher since the early 1970s, beginning on his home reservation at the Rocky Boy Elementary School (1973–1974) after which he moved to the K.W. Bergan Elementary School in Browning, Montana on the Blackfeet Indian reservation for a short time. He continued on to the Flathead Valley Community College in Kalispell, Montana (1975 – 77) where he helped found the Total Community Education television training program. When that program came to a close he moved on to the University of Lethbridge in 1977 where he eventually became Chair of Native American Studies (1999–2010). He taught in the Faculty Exchange Program at the University of Lethbridge/Leeds University Leeds, UK in 1985 and the Faculty Exchange Program University of Lethbridge/Hokkai Gakuen University Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan in 1992. He remained tenured at the U of L up until 2007 when he chose early retirement and began work as Department Head of Indian Fine Art at the First Nations University of Canada in Regina, Saskatchewan. In addition to his teaching activities at the First Nations University, Young Man also worked as archival curator and custodian of the school's 1500 piece art collection. In August 2010 his employment at FNUC was terminated along with approximately 52 other professors and support staff, due to financial exigency budget cuts. He was appointed in 2015 Adjunct Professor to the Art Department, University of Calgary.\n\nMost recently in terms of his lifetime, Young Man did an artist/writer's residency at the Lab 26 Tejiendo Identitdad Entre Las Culturas Originarias de America, Galeria de Arte Contemporaneo Paul Bardwell, Centro Colombo Americano de Medellin, Medellin, Colombia in 2011. He has spoken at numerous conferences and other venues held on every continent on the planet throughout his long professional career.\n\nPedagogically Young Man teaches his courses from the Native perspective, something unheard of when he began teaching Indian fine art at the University of Lethbridge in 1977 and something that, even today, very few if any Native art professionals of whatever category claim to do.\n\nYoung Man served as chair of the board of the Society of Canadian Artists of Native Ancestry, which was instrumental in convincing the National Gallery of Canada to include First Nations art and artists in its vast collection.\n\nThe Last Great Indian Art Movement of the 20th Century, to be published by J.Charlton Publishing Ltd. 3104 30th Ave., Suite 228, Vernon, BC V1T 9M9, Fall 2016\n\nThe Buckskin Ceiling: A Native perspective on Native art politics.

{"id": "1412016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1412016", "title": "Antiope (mother of Amphion)", "text": "Antiope (mother of Amphion)\n\nIn Greek mythology, Antiope (; Ancient Greek: Ἀντιόπη derived from \"αντι \"anti \"against, compared to, like\" and \"οψ \"ops \"voice\") was the daughter of the Boeotian river god Asopus, according to Homer; in later sources she is called the daughter of the \"nocturnal\" king Nycteus of Thebes or, in the \"Cypria\", of Lycurgus, but for Homer her site is purely Boeotian. She was the mother of Amphion and Zethus.\n\nHer beauty attracted Zeus, who, assuming the form of a satyr, took her by force. A.B. Cook noted that her myth \"took on a Dionysiac colouring, Antiope being represented as a Maenad and Zeus as a Satyr\". This is the sole mythic episode in which Zeus is transformed into a satyr. After this she was carried off by Epopeus, who was venerated as a hero in Sicyon; he would not give her up till compelled by her uncle Lycus.\n\nOn the way home she gave birth, in the neighbourhood of Eleutherae on Mount Cithaeron, to the twins Amphion and Zethus, of whom Amphion was the son of the god, and Zethus the son of Epopeus. Both were left to be brought up by herdsmen. At Thebes Antiope now suffered from the persecution of Dirce, the wife of Lycus, but at last escaped towards Eleutherae, and there found shelter, unknowingly, in the house where her two sons were living as herdsmen. This is the situation in Euripides' \"Antiope\", which turns upon the recognition of mother and sons and their rescue of her.\n\nHere she was discovered by Dirce, who had come to celebrate a Bacchic festival; she ordered the two young men to tie Antiope to the horns of a wild bull. They were about to obey, when the old herdsman, who had brought them up, revealed his secret, and they carried out the punishment on Dirce instead, for cruel treatment of Antiope, their mother, who had been treated by Dirce as a slave. In Euripides, the descent of Hermes stops the brothers from putting their uncle to death; Lycus then resigns power in the Cadmeia of Thebes to the twins.\n\nFor the treatment of Dirce, it is said, Dionysus, to whose worship she had been devoted, visited Antiope with madness, which caused her to wander restlessly all over Greece until she was cured, and married by Phocus of Tithorca, on Mount Parnassus, where both were buried in one grave.\nAmphion became a great singer and musician after Hermes taught him to play and gave him a golden lyre; Zethus was a hunter and herdsman. For Greeks of the Classical age, the contrast between the lifestyles of the two became the most salient element in the narrative; in Euripides' \"Antiope\" the best-recalled scene was where the two brothers in debate contrasted their active and contemplative lives. Together they built and fortified Thebes, huge blocks of stone forming themselves into walls at the sound of Amphion's lyre. Amphion married Niobe, and killed himself after the loss of his wife and children. Zethus married Aedon, or sometimes Thebe. The brothers were buried in one grave.\n\nAt Sicyon, Antiope was important enough that a chryselephantine cult image was created of her and set up in the temple of Aphrodite. Pausanias speaks of it. Only one priestess, an elderly woman, was permitted to enter the \"cella\" of the temple, with a young girl chosen each year, to serve as \"Lutrophoros\".\n\nEuripides' \"Antiope\", presented about 408 BCE, was widely quoted, in Plato's \"Gorgias\" and many other authors, resulting in a large array of fragments. In 1890 Flinders Petrie discovered further papyrus fragments, which had been reused in constructing a 3rd-century BCE Ptolemaic mummy case found in the Fayoum; the palaeography suggested that the scroll was old before it was reused as waste, making these fragments the earliest surviving text of any Greek play; the discovery occasioned a rash of new readings of the existing fragments. The modern comprehensive reconstruction of all the fragments is that of Jean Kambitsis, ed. and commentator, \"L'Antiope d'Euripide\" (Athens, 1972).\n\nThe myth of Amphion, the legendary founder of Thebes, and Antiope inspired a lot of other similar myths in several areas of Greece. Amphion was son of Zeus and of Antiope, daughter of the Boeotian river god Asopus. The myth took a Dionysiac colour because Zeus was transformed into a satyr in a sole mythic event and Antiope into a maenad. After this she was carried off by Epopeus in Sicyon, where he was venerated later as a hero in the temenos of Athena. Burkert notices the similarity with the myth of Athena Polias and Erechtheus in Athens.\n\nReturning to Thebes, on Mount Cithaeron she gave birth to the twins Amphion, son of the god, and Zethus, son of the mortal Epopeus. The story is mentioned in fragments of the Hesiodic \"Catalogue of Women\" (frr. 182, 183) and Asius of Samos (fr. 1). Other twins of similar dual parentage are the Greek Dioscuri who often appear as snakes, protecting the temples. Amphion, the founder of Thebes, became a great singer and musician with a golden lyre, and huge blocks of stone formed themselves into the walls of \"Thebes\", the city with the seven gates. His brother \"Zethus\" became a hunter and a herdsman and the two brothers represent the contrast between two different lifestyles. In Euripides' tragedy \"Antiope\" they contrasted in debate their active and contemplative lives.\n\nDionysos, to whose worship Antiope was devoted, visited her with madness, causing her to wander restlessly all over Greece until she was cured. This myth is similar to that of Io, a priestess of the goddess Hera in Argos who was stung by a gadfly and wandered in madness to Egypt. Her sons Cadmus and Danaos returned to Greece, where they became kings of \"Thebes\" and \"Argos\".\n\n\n"}

He joined the army medical staff in Portugal in 1798, was gazetted next year assistant-surgeon to the Royals, served in Holland, at Ferrol, in Egypt, the Mediterranean, the West Indies, and through the Peninsular War, having been appointed to the staff in 1808 and made deputy inspector-general of hospitals in 1813. He retired in 1814 with that rank and the war medal with five clasps, and commenced practice as a physician in Argyll Street, London. He graduated from Edinburgh University in 1808 with a Doctor of Medicine, and joined the College of Physicians of London in 1814, becoming a fellow in 1841.\n\nIn 1816 he was appointed physician to the newly founded Royal Westminster Infirmary for Diseases of the Eye in Warwick Street, Golden Square, having George James Guthrie as his surgical colleague. In 1827 a difference of opinion arose between Forbes and Guthrie as to the treatment of inflammatory affections of the eye; the subject was noticed in \"The Lancet\" adversely to Guthrie, who began an action for libel against the journal, but abandoned it on learning that Forbes had been subpoenaed as a witness. Having been insulted at the hospital by one Hale Thomson, a young surgeon in Guthrie's party, Forbes challenged Thomson to a duel. It was fought with pistols on Clapham Common at half-past three in the afternoon of 29 December 1827; when each had fired twice without effect, the seconds interposed, but another encounter was demanded by the principals, which was also harmless. The seconds then declared the duel at an end, against the wishes of the parties.\n\nForbes resigned his appointment at the hospital, carrying a number of its subscribers with him. He declined an offer by Guthrie to give him the satisfaction of a gentleman and an officer of the same service, on the ground that the offer was not made until after events at the hospital had been allowed to take their course. He had a considerable practice among a number of families of the nobility. He was a Knight of the Crescent, in 1837 was made a Guelphic knight of Hanover, and in 1844 an English knight.

She was a co-anchor on \"Ten Eyewitness News\". Dragun, who had been diagnosed with depression and had a history of anorexia, died by suicide on 2 November 2007.\n\nDragun graduated from the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts with a degree in broadcast journalism. She began her career as a radio journalist and newsreader at Perth radio stations 6PR and 96FM. She was nominated for \"Young Journalist of the Year\" and won both the Australian and state \"Best Radio Reports\" award.\n\nDragun switched from radio to television when she was offered a position at Network Ten. She started out reporting a wide range of stories from entertainment news to major national news stories and eventually began court reporting regularly. She occasionally filled in as a presenter on Perth's \"Ten News at Five\" and on 4 July 2005, she was appointed as permanent news anchor for the show, which was broadcast from Network Ten's Sydney studio TEN at Pyrmont, New South Wales. She was a main co-anchor of \"Ten Eyewitness News\" and also filled in on the national morning and weekend news bulletins and presented \"Ten Late News\" on Fridays. Dragun's co-anchor, veteran broadcaster Tim Webster, described her as \"one of the most professional I've ever seen, very meticulous...if she made a mistake she was distraught about it.\"\n\nCharmaine Margaret Dragun was born in Perth, Western Australia to Estelle and Michael Dragun. According to her mother, Dragun was a perfectionist and developed anorexia while she was attending university at the WA Academy of Performing Arts and continued to have problems related to anorexia periodically for the next several years. When she was 18 years old, she saw a psychiatrist to address the eating disorder and was also diagnosed with depression and started on a class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that she continued taking for several years.\n\nDragun was engaged to Simon Struthers, a forensic investigator, whom she had been dating since she was 16 years old, and they were planning to marry on Dragun's 30th birthday.\n\nIn 2004, eight months before moving to Sydney, Dragun told her mother that her medication made her feel numb and she started seeing a psychiatrist who recommended that Dragun discontinue medication altogether. Her mother said that Dragun's symptoms started to go \"down hill\" after six weeks off antidepressants. She moved back home with her parents and temporarily ended her relationship with Struthers, stating that she couldn't give him happiness. She restarted pharmacotherapy on a new class of antidepressants, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), prescribed by her general practitioner (GP), which she took until 2007.\n\nWhen she moved to Sydney in 2005, Dragun and Struthers reunited and after a few months, were living together in Sydney. Dragun had difficulty adjusting to the new city and being so far from family. She started working with a clinical psychologist there that she reportedly had a good rapport with, according to Dragun's mother.\n\nAround August or September 2007, Dragun's symptoms worsened and her psychologist recommended that Dragun consult a psychiatrist about adjusting her medication. In October 2007, her new psychiatrist had initiated a cross-taper to change Dragun from the SNRI to a different brand of SSRI, a change which can take up to six weeks to take effect. Dragun initially told her mother that she was optimistic about the switch, but after less than three weeks, she told her mother over the phone that she was having thoughts of suicide and that she felt \"worthless.\" Dragun died by suicide a few days later.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, at age 29, Dragun died by suicide near The Gap in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. According to news reports, Dragun sat near the gully for around two hours, something she had done several times in the weeks leading up to her suicide, and sent a farewell text message to Struthers before jumping to her death. Witnesses who had seen someone sitting near the popular suicide spot had contacted the police, but Dragun was dead by the time officers arrived. A funeral was held ten days later at All Saints Church in Greenwood, Western Australia.\n\nDuring 2010, an official inquest into the medical support surrounding Dragun at the time of her death was held by the Coroner's Court in Glebe, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney. The deputy state coroner stated that the ease of access to the Gap had been a causal factor. He also speculated that Dragun may have been misdiagnosed with depression, but according to \"The Australian\", he also said that her medication did not \"put [suicidal] ideas into her head or cause her to behave in an irrational way and with no control over her actions\".\n"}

It includes established ethnic groups who have lived within the borders of China since at least the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). The term \"zhonghua minzu\" was used during the Republic of China from 1911–1949 to refer to a subset of five ethnic groups in China. The term \"zhongguo renmin\" (), \"Chinese people\", was the government's preferred term during the life of Mao Zedong; \"zhonghua minzu\" is more common in recent decades.\n\nThe Nationality law of the People's Republic of China regulates nationality within the PRC.

{"id": "3113151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3113151", "title": "Early life of Joseph Smith", "text": "Early life of Joseph Smith\n\nJoseph Smith (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was an American religious leader and the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement whose current followers include members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) and members of the Community of Christ. The early life of Joseph Smith covers his life from his birth to the end of 1827.\n\nSmith was born in Sharon, Vermont, the fifth of eleven children born to Joseph and Lucy Mack Smith. By 1817, Smith's family had moved to the \"burned-over district\" of western New York, an area repeatedly swept by religious revivals during the Second Great Awakening. Smith family members held divergent views about organized religion, believed in visions and prophecies, and engaged in certain folk religious practices typical of the era. Smith briefly investigated Methodism, but he was generally disillusioned with the churches of his day.\n\nAround 1820 Smith is said to have experienced a theophany, now known as his First Vision among adherents. Around this time he, along with other male members of his family, was hired to assist in searching for buried treasure. In 1823, Smith said an angel directed him to a nearby hill where he said was buried a book of golden plates containing a Christian history of ancient American civilizations. According to Smith, the angel prevented him from taking the plates in 1823, telling him to come back in exactly a year. Smith made annual visits to the hill over the next three years, reporting to his family that he had not yet been allowed to take the plates.\n\nMeanwhile, during one of Smith's treasure hunting expeditions, he met and fell in love with Emma Smith from Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, whom he married in 1827. Returning with Emma to the hill in 1827, Smith said the angel allowed him to take the plates but forbade him from showing them to anyone except those to whom the angel directed. As news of the plates spread, Smith's former treasure hunting associates sought to share in the proceeds, ransacking places they thought the plates were hidden. Intending to translate the plates himself, Smith moved to Harmony Township to live with his in-laws.\n\nSmith was born in Sharon, Vermont, the fifth of eleven children born to Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. Through modern DNA testing of Smith's relatives, it's likely that the Smith family were of Irish descent originally. Smith carried the Y-DNA marker R-M222, a subclade of Haplogroup R1b found almost entirely in people of Northwestern Irish descent today.\n\nThe Smiths were a middling farm family, but suffered a fateful loss when Smith Sr., after speculating in ginseng and being cheated by a business associate, was financially ruined. After he sold the family farm to pay his debts, the Smiths \"crossed the boundary dividing independent ownership from tenancy and day labor.\" In the next fourteen years, the Smiths moved seven times.\n\nDespite the moves and the financial woes, Lucy Smith remembered the period of Joseph Smith's early childhood as \"perfectly comfortable both for food and raiment as well as that which is necessary to a respectable appearance in society.\" Then during the winter of 1812–1813, typhoid fever struck along the Connecticut Valley, including the area around Lebanon, New Hampshire, where the Smiths had recently moved. A number of family members fell ill, and Joseph experienced a common complication whereby typhoid bacteria infected bone, in Smith's case, the shin bone. Lucy later claimed that she had refused to permit her son's leg to be amputated; in fact, the Smiths had chanced on one of New England's most respected physicians, Nathan Smith, who \"probably alone in American medicine at this time\" advocated removal of the dead portion of the bone rather than amputation of the leg. After the typically horrific early nineteenth-century surgery without either anesthetic or antiseptic, Smith eventually recovered, though he used crutches for several years and had a slight limp for the remainder of his life.\nIn 1814 the Smiths moved back across the Connecticut River to Norwich, Vermont, where they suffered three seasons of crop failures, the last the result of the Year Without a Summer. The extended Smith clan had already moved west to New York, and in 1817, Joseph Smith Sr. traveled alone to Palmyra, New York, followed shortly by the rest of his family—although not before Lucy Smith was forced to settle with some last-minute creditors. In Palmyra village, Smith Sr. and his oldest sons hired themselves out as common laborers, ran a \"cake and beer shop,\" and peddled refreshments from a cart; Lucy painted cloth coverings for tables and stands.\n\nIn 1820, the family contracted to pay for a farm just outside Palmyra in Manchester Township. The Smith family first built a log home, then in 1822, under the supervision of Joseph Smith's oldest brother Alvin, they began building a larger frame house. Alvin died in November 1823, possibly as a result of being given calomel for \"bilious fever\", and the house remained uncompleted for a year. By this time Joseph Smith Sr. may have partially abdicated family leadership to Alvin, and in 1825, the Smiths were unable to make their mortgage payments. When their creditor foreclosed, the family persuaded a local Quaker, Lemuel Durfee, to buy the farm and rent it to them. Nevertheless, in 1829, the Smiths and five of their children moved back into the log house, with Hyrum Smith and his wife.\n\nJoseph Smith had little formal schooling, but may have attended school briefly in Palmyra and received instruction in his home. Young Joseph worked on his family farm and perhaps took an occasional odd job or worked for nearby farmers. His mother described him as \"much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of the children, but far more given to meditation and deep study.\" Lucy Smith also noted that though he never read through the Bible until he was at least eighteen, he was imaginative and could regale the family with \"the most amusing recitals\" of the life and religion of ancient Native Americans \"with as much ease, seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life with them.\" Smith was variously described as \"remarkably quiet,\" \"taciturn,\" \"proverbially good-natured,\" and \"never known to laugh.\" One acquaintance said Smith had \"a jovial, easy, don't-care way about him,\" and he had an aptitude for debating moral and political issues in a local junior debating club. Biographer Fawn Brodie wrote, \"He was a gregarious, cheerful, imaginative youth, born to leadership, but hampered by meager education and grinding poverty.\"\n\nSmith grew to maturity during the Second Great Awakening, a period of religious excitement in the United States. New York west of the Catskill and Adirondack Mountains became known as the \"Burned-over district\" because it was \"repeatedly singed by the fires of revival that swept through the region in the early years of the nineteenth century.\" Major multi-denominational religious revivals occurred in the Palmyra area in both 1816-17 (when the Smiths were in the process of migrating from Vermont) and in 1824-25. Small denominational revivals and camp meetings occurred during the intervals.\nJoseph Smith's ancestors had an eclectic variety of religious views and affiliations. For instance, Joseph Smith's paternal grandfather, Asael, was a Universalist who opposed evangelical religion. According to Lucy Smith, Asael once came to Joseph Smith Sr.'s door after he had attended a Methodist meeting with Lucy and \"threw Tom Paine's \"Age of Reason\" into the house and angrily bade him read that until he believed it.\" Conversely, in 1811 Smith's maternal grandfather, Solomon Mack, self-published a book describing a series of heavenly visions and voices he said had led to his conversion to Christianity at the age of seventy-six.\n\nSmith's parents also experienced visions. Before Joseph was born, his mother Lucy, prayed in a grove about her husband's refusal to attend church and later said she had had a dream-vision, which she interpreted as a prophecy that Joseph Sr. would later accept the \"pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God.\" According to Lucy, Joseph Smith Sr. also had seven visions between 1811 and 1819, coming at a time when he was \"much excited upon the subject of religion.\" These visions confirmed in his mind the correctness of his refusal to join any organized church and led him to believe that he would be directed in the proper path toward salvation. Lucy's account, recorded thirty years after the period in which the visions are said to have occurred, suggests \"a tendency to make her husband the predecessor of her son\" by echoing passages in the Book of Mormon.\n\nLike perhaps thousands of contemporary Americans, the Smith family practiced various forms of folk magic such as using divining rods and seer stones to search for buried treasure. Four witnesses reported that the Smiths used divining rods in the Palmyra area, and sometime between Joseph Smith's eleventh and thirteenth years, he began \"following his father's example in using a divining rod.\" Magical parchments handed down in the Hyrum Smith family may have belonged to Joseph Sr. Lucy Mack Smith noted in her memoirs that while family members were \"trying to win the faculty of Abrac, drawing magic circles or sooth saying,\" they did not neglect manual labor, \"but whilst we worked with our hands we endeavored to remember the service of & the welfare of our souls.\" Smith's reputation among his Palmyra neighbors was that of a \"nondescript farm boy\" who was \"lazy and superstitious,\" and townspeople viewed his family as \"treasure-seekers, not eager Christians.\" Thus, Smith was reared in a family that believed in prophecy and visions, was skeptical of organized religion, and was interested in both folk magic and new religious ideas.\n\nSmith said he had become concerned about religion \"at about the age of twelve years,\" although later he seems to have wondered whether \"a Supreme being did exist.\" Smith apparently attended the Presbyterian Sunday school as a child, and later as an adolescent, he displayed interest in Methodism. One of Smith's acquaintances said that Smith had caught \"a spark of Methodism\" at camp meetings \"away down in the woods, on the Vienna road.\" He even reportedly spoke during some of these meetings, and the acquaintance described Smith as a \"very passable exhorter.\"\n\nNevertheless, at some point after 1822, Smith withdrew from organized religion. According to his mother, Smith claimed, \"I can take my Bible, and go into the woods, and learn more in two hours, than you can learn at meeting in two years, if you should go all the time.\" Still, Smith seems to have been significantly influenced by the interdenominational revival of 1824-25.\n\nLike his father, the younger Smith reportedly had his own set of visions, the first of which occurred in the early 1820s when Smith was in his early teens and is called by Latter Day Saints the First Vision. The first description of this event was not published until 1832, which said the event occurred in 1821; however, most accounts date the event to the year 1820. The First Vision was a theophany (a personal and direct communication from God). The details of the theophany have varied as the story was retold throughout Smith's life.\n\nAccording to accounts by Joseph and his brother, William, the First Vision was prompted in part by a reading of James 1:5, which in the King James Version reads, \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him\"; William suggested that Smith \"ask of God\". William also suggested that much of the \"religious excitement\" in the area was caused by the Rev. George Lane, a \"great revival preacher\". Lane is never recorded as having visited Palmyra until 1824, although he visited nearby Vienna in 1819 for a large Methodist conference. Joseph and his family could have traveled to sell cake and beer at this event, as they did other events in the Palmyra vicinity, but this is pure speculation.\nThe exact details of the First Vision vary somewhat depending upon who is recounting the story and when. Smith's first account in 1832 dated the vision to 1821 and stated that he saw \"a piller [sic] of fire light above the brightness of the sun at noon day\", and that \"the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord and he spake unto me saying Joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee\". Whether Smith regarded this event as a \"vision\" or as an actual \"visitation\" by a physical being has been debated, because a missionary tract published for Smith's church in 1840 stated that after Smith saw the light, \"his mind was caught away, from the natural objects with which he was surrounded; and he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision\".\n\nIn an account Smith dictated in 1838 for inclusion in the official church history, he described the First Vision as an appearance of two divine personages sometime during the spring of 1820:\n\"I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me…When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name, and said, pointing to the other, 'This is my Beloved Son. Hear Him!'\".\n\nIt is unclear who, if anyone, Smith told about his vision prior to his reported discovery of the golden plates in 1823. According to Smith, he told his mother at the time that he had \"learned for [him]self that Presbyterianism is not true\"; however, mention of this conversation is omitted from Lucy's own history, and Joseph never stated that he described the details of the vision to his family in 1820 or soon thereafter. He \"did\" say that he spoke about the vision with \"one of the Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before-mentioned religious excitement\". Many have presumed this to be the Rev. Lane, but there is no record of Lane visiting the Palmyra vicinity in 1820. Joseph's brother William was apparently unaware of any visions until 1823, although he would have only been nine years old in 1820.\n\nSmith stated that the retelling of his vision story \"excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase\". Tales of visions and theophanies, however, were not unusual at the time, though the clergy of many organized religions often resisted the stories. Early prejudice against Smith may have taken place by clergy, but there is no contemporary record of this. The bulk of Smith's persecution seems to have arisen among laity, and not because of his First Vision, but because of his later assertion to have discovered the golden plates in a hill near his home; the statement was widely publicized and ridiculed in local newspapers beginning around 1827.\n\nYears later, one non-Mormon neighbor summed up views of Smith and his family by their Palmyra neighbors by saying, \"To tell the truth, there was something about him they could not understand; some way he knew more than they did, and it made them mad.\"\n\nFrom about 1819, Smith regularly practiced scrying, a form of divination in which a \"seer\" looked into a seer stone to receive supernatural knowledge. Smith usually practiced crystal gazing by putting a stone at the bottom of a white stovepipe hat, putting his face over the hat to block the light, then divining information from the stone. Smith and his father achieved \"something of a mysterious local reputation in the profession—mysterious because there is no record that they ever found anything despite the readiness of some local residents to pay for their efforts.\"\n\nIn late 1825, Josiah Stowell, a well-to-do farmer from South Bainbridge, Chenango County, New York, who had been searching for a lost Spanish mine near Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania with another seer, traveled to Manchester to hire Smith \"on account of having heard that he possessed certain keys, by which he could discern things invisible to the natural eye.\"\n\nSmith agreed to take the job of assisting Stowell and Hale, and he and his father worked with the Stowell-Hale team for approximately one month, attempting, according to their contract, to locate \"a valuable mine of either Gold or Silver and also...coined money and bars or ingots of Gold or Silver\". Smith boarded with an Isaac Hale (a relative of William Hale), and fell in love with Isaac Hale's daughter Emma, a schoolteacher he would later marry in 1827. Isaac Hale, however, disapproved of their relationship and of Smith in general. According to an unsupported account by Hale, Smith attempted to locate the mine by burying his face in a hat containing the seer stone; however, as the treasure hunters got close to their objective, Smith said that an enchantment became so strong that Smith could no longer see it. The failed project disbanded on November 17, 1825; however, Smith continued to work for Stowell on other matters until 1826.\nIn 1826 Smith was arrested and brought to court in Bainbridge, New York, on the complaint of Stowell's nephew who accused Smith of being \"a disorderly person and an imposter.\" Court records show that Smith, identified as \"The Glass Looker,\" stood before the court on March 20, 1826, on a warrant for an unspecified misdemeanor charge, and that the judge issued a \"mittimus\" for Smith to be held, either during or after the proceedings. Although Smith's associate Oliver Cowdery later stated that Smith was \"honorably acquitted,\" the result of the proceeding is unclear, with some claiming he was found guilty, others claiming he was \"condemned\" but \"designedly allowed to escape,\" and yet others (including the trial note taker) claiming he was \"discharged\" for lack of evidence.\n\nBy November 1826, Josiah Stowell could no longer afford to continue searching for buried treasure; Smith traveled to Colesville, New York, for a few months to work for Joseph Knight Sr., one of Stowell's friends. There are reports that Smith directed further excavations on Knight's property and at other locations around Colesville. Smith later commented on his working as a treasure hunter: \"'Was not Joseph Smith a money digger?' Yes, but it was never a very profitable job for him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.\"\n\nBecause Smith had been unable to gain Isaac Hale's approval, he and Emma Hale Smith eloped to South Bainbridge on January 18, 1827, after which Joseph and Emma went to live with Smith's parents in Manchester, New York.\n\nWhile Smith was working as a treasure hunter, he was also frequently occupied with another more religious matter: acquiring a set of golden plates he said were deposited, along with other artifacts, in a prominent hill near his home.\n\nIn Smith's own account dated 1838, he stated that an angel visited him on the night of September 21, 1823. Concerning the visit, Smith dictated the following:\n\nHe called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.\n\nHe said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness[sic] of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants; also that there were two stones in silver bows—and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim—deposited with the plates\".\nThe words \"Urim and Thummim\" derive from passages in the Old Testament which describe the use of \"the Urim and the Thummim\" as a means for divination by Israelite priests (see, e.g., Exodus 28:30).\n\nAfter the messenger departed, Smith said he had two more encounters with him that night and an additional one the next morning, after which he told his father and soon thereafter the rest of his family, who believed his story, but generally kept it within the family.\nThus, on September 22, 1823, a day listed in local almanacs as the autumn equinox, Smith said that he went to a prominent hill near his home, and found the location of the artifacts. There are varying accounts as to how Smith reportedly found the precise location of the golden plates. In 1838, Smith stated that this location was shown to him in a vision while he conversed with Moroni. This conforms to an account by Smith's friend Joseph Knight Sr., though he refers to Smith's guide only as \"the personage.\" However, according to a Palmyra resident Henry Harris, who said Smith told him he located the plates using his seer stone. In yet another account, the angel required Smith to follow a sequence of landmarks until he arrived at the correct location.\n\nThe plates, according to Smith, were inside a covered stone box. However, Smith stated he was unable to obtain the plates at his first visit. According to an account by Willard Chase, the angel gave Smith a strict set of \"commandments\" which he was to follow in order to obtain the plates. Among these requirements, according to Chase, was that Smith must approach the site \"dressed in black clothes, and riding a black horse with a switch tail, and demand the book in a certain name, and after obtaining it, he must go directly away, and neither lay it down nor look behind him\". Smith's close friend Joseph Knight Sr. corroborates the requirement that Smith was to \"take the Book and go right away\". According to Smith's mother, the angel forbade him to put the plates on the ground until they were under lock and key. He was, however, according to a retelling of an account by Smith Sr., allowed to put down the plates on a napkin he was to bring with him for that purpose.\n\nWhen Smith arrived at the place where the plates were supposed to be, he reportedly took the plates from the stone box they were in and set them down on the ground nearby, looking to see if there were other items in the box that would \"be of some pecuniary advantage to him\". When he turned around, however, the plates were said to have disappeared into the box, which was then closed. When Smith attempted to get the plates back out of the box, the angel hurled him back to the ground with a violent force (\"id.\"). After three failed attempts to retrieve the plates, the angel told him that he could not have them then, because he \"had been tempted of the advisary and saught the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should have\".\n\nThus, Smith said the angel directed him to return the next year on September 22, 1824, with the \"right person\", whom the angel reportedly said was his brother Alvin. However, Alvin died within a few months, and when Smith returned to the hill in 1824, he did not return with the plates. Once again, the angel reportedly told Smith that he must return the next year with the \"right person\", the identity of whom the angel would not say. According to Smith's associate Willard Chase, Smith originally thought this person was to be Samuel Tyler Lawrence, a \"seer\" himself who worked in Smith's treasure-seeking company in Palmyra, and therefore Smith reportedly took Lawrence to the hill in 1825. At Lawrence's prompting, Smith reportedly ascertained through his seer stone that there was an additional item together with the plates in the box, which Smith later called the \"Urim and Thummim\". However, Lawrence was apparently not the \"right person\", because Smith did not obtain the plates in his 1825 visit.\n\nLater, Smith reportedly determined by looking into his seer stone that the \"right person\" was Emma Hale Smith, his future wife. There is no specific record of Smith seeing the angel in 1826, however, after Joseph and Emma were married on January 18, 1827, Smith returned to Manchester, and as he passed by Cumorah, he said he was chastised by the angel for not being \"engaged enough in the work of the Lord\". He was reportedly told that the next annual meeting was his last chance to get the plates and the Urim and Thummim.\nJust days prior to the day Smith said he was to meet with the angel on September 22, 1827, Smith's treasure-seeking associate, Josiah Stowell, and Joseph Knight Sr. arranged to be in Palmyra for the attempt to retrieve the plates. Because Smith was concerned that Samuel Lawrence, his earlier confidant, might interfere, Smith sent his father to spy on Lawrence's house the night of September 21 until dark. Late that night, Smith took the horse and carriage of Joseph Knight Sr. to Cumorah with his wife Emma. Leaving Emma in the wagon, where she knelt in prayer, he reportedly walked to the site of the golden plates, retrieved them, and hid them in a fallen tree-top on or near the hill. He also reportedly retrieved the Urim and Thummim, which he showed to his mother the next morning. According to Knight, Smith was more fascinated by this artifact than he was the plates.\n\nOver the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby Macedon to obtain money to buy a solid lockable chest in which he said he would put the plates. By then, however, some of Smith's treasure-seeking company had heard that Smith was successful in obtaining the plates, and they wanted what they believed was their cut of the profits from what they saw as part of their joint venture. Spying once again on the house of Samuel Lawrence, Smith Sr. determined that a group of ten–twelve of these men, including Lawrence and Willard Chase, had enlisted the talents of a renowned and supposedly talented seer from sixty miles away, in an effort to locate where the plates were hidden by means of divination. When Emma heard of this, she went to Macedon and informed Smith Jr., who reportedly determined through his Urim and Thummim that the plates were safe, but nevertheless he hurriedly traveled home by horseback. Once home in Palmyra, he then walked to Cumorah and said he removed the plates from their hiding place, and walked back home with the plates wrapped in a linen frock under his arm, suffering a dislocated thumb as he fended off attackers.\n\nAccording to Smith, the plates \"had the appearance of gold\", and were:\nsix inches wide and eight inches long and not quite so thick as common tin. They were filled with engravings, in Ancient Egyptian characters and bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed. The characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity in its construction and much skill in the art of engraving.\n\nSmith refused to allow anyone, including his family, to view the plates directly. Some people, however, were allowed to heft them or feel them through a cloth. At first, he reportedly kept the plates in a chest under the hearth in his parents' home. Fearing it might be discovered, however, Smith hid the chest under the floor boards of his parents' old log home nearby. Later, he said he took the plates out of the chest, left the empty chest under the floor boards, and hid the plates in a barrel of flax, not long before the location of the empty box was discovered and the place ransacked by Smith's former treasure-seeking associates, who had enlisted one of the men's sisters to find that location by looking in her seer stone.\n\nJoseph Smith's intention was to keep the box reportedly containing the golden plates safe from his Palmyra neighbors while he dictated a translation of the book's reputed contents, which he would then publish. To do so, however, he needed an investment of money, and at the time he was penniless. Therefore, Smith sent his mother to the home of Martin Harris, a local landowner said at the time to be worth about $8,000 to $10,000.\n\nHarris had apparently been a close confidant of the Smith family since at least 1826, and he may have heard about Smith's attempts to obtain the plates from the angel even earlier from Smith Sr. He was also a believer in Smith's powers with his seer stone. When Lucy visited Harris, he had heard about Smith's report to have found golden plates through the grapevine in Palmyra, and was interested in finding out more. Thus, at Lucy Smith's request, Harris went to the Smith home, heard the story from Smith, and hefted a glass box that Smith said contained the plates. Smith convinced Harris that he had the plates, and that the angel had told him to \"quit the company of the money-diggers\". Convinced, Harris immediately gave Smith $50, and committed to sponsor the translation of the plates.\n\nThe money provided by Harris was enough to pay all of Smith's debts in Palmyra, and for him to travel with Emma and all of their belongings to Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, where they would be able to avoid the public commotion in Palmyra over the plates. Thus, in early October 1827, they moved to Harmony, with the glass box reportedly holding the plates hidden during the trip in a barrel of beans.\n\n"}

Hjörleifur Einarsson and Guðlaug Eyjólfsdóttir. His name was originally Einar Hjorleifsson but he adopted the family name Kvaran in 1916 along with his brothers Sigurdur and Trygvi and the sons of his deceased brother Joseph. (The name is taken from \"Laxdæla saga\". In 1913, the Althing passed a law, since rescinded, which permitted Icelanders to adopt family names. Einar Hjörleifsson was on a committee that proposed to allow certain categories of names, including those with ancient origins.)\n\nEinar graduated in 1881 from the College of Iceland, known as the Latin School. As a student in economics at the University of Copenhagen in 1882, he was one of four students to publish the single issue of the literary periodical \"Verðandi\", which introduced to Iceland the Modern Breakthrough expounded by Georg Brandes. Einar was one of the pioneers of realism in Icelandic writing; his stories and novels represent a break with past admiration of the sagas: they are written in educated contemporary language and deal with ordinary people and problems.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1895 Einar emigrated to Icelandic Canada, where he lived in Winnipeg and helped found two Icelandic-language weekly publications, \"Heimskringla\" (\"Globe\") and \"Lögberg\" (\"Tribune\"). On his return to Iceland he was a journalist and editor in both Reykjavík and Akureyri; he participated in the struggle for independence and also wrote about education, temperance and theatre. He was co-editor of \"Ísafold\", then Iceland's leading newspaper, and editor of \"Fjallkonan\". He edited \"Skírnir\", the journal of the Icelandic Literary Society, from 1892 to 1895 and from 1908 to 1909. \n\nEinar wrote numerous short stories, novels, plays, and a volume of early poems. His breakthrough work was the story \"Vonir\" (\"Hopes\"), which he wrote in 1890 while in Canada and which deals with the emigrant experience. In 1906 the Government of Iceland granted him a stipend to enable him to devote himself entirely to writing. \n\nEinar was also a prominent Spiritualist, author of the first positive assessment of spiritualism in Icelandic and co-founder and President of the Experimental Society which gave rise to the Icelandic Society for Psychical Research (\"Sálarrannsóknarfélag Íslands\"), of which he was the first president. He played a major part in the investigation and publicising of many Icelandic mediums, notably Indriði Indriðason and Hafstein Björnsson. His later writings were dominated by spiritualism, particularly the novel \"Sögur Rannveigar\" (\"Rannveig's Tales\", parts I and II 1919 and 1922), but also by Christian humanism. He influenced Icelanders to be less rigidly orthodox and to be less harsh in rearing their children. \n\nIn the 1920s, there was a rumour that Kvaran was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in response Sigurður Nordal disparaged him as overly focused on forgiveness and thus tolerant of things that should rather be opposed; in the spirit of Icelandic nationalism and contemporary interpretations of Nietzsche, he considered the blood feud a better ethical model. In the 1930s Halldór Laxness criticised him more sharply yet for his spiritualism.\n\nEinar was married twice. His first wife, Mathilde Petersen, was Danish; she died in Canada, and their two children both died in infancy. In 1888 he married Gíslína Gísladóttir. They had five children; the eldest, Sigurður, died of tuberculosis when he was 15.\n\n"}

He attended Corydon Central High School and then Indiana University, where he met his wife Judy. In Corydon he served as a practicing attorney and a newspaper publisher for \"The Corydon Democrat\" before his entrance into the political arena.\n\nOriginally elected to the state senate in 1969, O'Bannon worked his way up in leadership, becoming one of the body's most prominent members. He was briefly a candidate for Governor of Indiana in 1988, however, instead of facing a hotly competitive primary, O'Bannon dropped out of the race and accepted the position of running mate under Evan Bayh. The Bayh/O'Bannon ticket was successful, and O'Bannon served in the role as lieutenant governor for 8 years. In this position he served as President of the state senate, and directed the state's agriculture and commerce programs.\n\nIn 1996, O'Bannon made a bid for governor. He was initially considered a heavy underdog, but emerged a narrow victor over Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith. He was heavily re-elected in 2000 over Congressman David M. McIntosh. As governor, O'Bannon was known for advocating for education-related issues and helped create the state's AMBER Alert System. He presided over a period of economic prosperity for the state in the 1990s and served as a term as Chairman of Midwestern Governors Association.\n\nIn 2003, O'Bannon suffered a massive stroke in Chicago, Illinois, while attending a trade conference. He died days later and was succeeded by his Lieutenant Governor Joe E. Kernan. Several memorials were dedicated to his memory and his wife still remains active in community and political issues.\n\nO'Bannon was a native of Corydon, Indiana (the first state capital of Indiana), where his family owned the \"Corydon Democrat\", the town's newspaper. He attended Indiana University, where he played one season of basketball for the Hoosiers. At IU, he was president of the Zeta Chapter of the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity. He earned a B.A. in government in 1952, and a J.D. in 1957 from the Indiana University School of Law – Bloomington.\n\nHe also spent two years in the United States Air Force. While at IU, he met his wife, Judith Asmus, and they married in 1958. Following law school, he opened a law office in Corydon, was chairman of the board of the family newspaper publishing firm (a position he held until the time of his death), and was a member of the board of the Corydon Savings and Loan.\n\nFirst elected to the state senate in 1969-70 to a seat occupied by his father, Robert P. O'Bannon from 1950 to 1970, he was the primary sponsor of legislation reintroducing the death penalty. He rose to the rank of Senate Minority Leader among Democrats during his tenure in the legislative body. He served one two-year stint as chair of the Senate Finance Committee following a short-lived Democratic majority. He launched his first campaign for governor in May 1987 from Corydon, Indiana and initially faced off against then-Secretary of State Evan Bayh and Kokomo Mayor Steve Daily. O'Bannon abandoned his own bid for governor in January 1988 and joined forces with Bayh and won election as the 46th Lieutenant Governor of Indiana in November 1988. His candidacy for lieutenant governor matched that of his grandfather, Lew M. O'Bannon, who was the 1924 Democratic nominee for the state's second highest office. As lieutenant governor, he presided as President of the State Senate, served as the state's Director of Commerce and Commissioner of Agriculture.\n\nIn 1996 O'Bannon was the Democratic nominee for governor. He overcame an early deficit in the polls against his Republican opponent, Indianapolis mayor Stephen Goldsmith and won in a close race, 52% to 47%. He was re-elected by a larger margin, 57% to 42%, in 2000 against second district Congressman David M. McIntosh.\n\nDuring the boom years of the 1990s, when Indiana amassed a record $2 billion surplus, O'Bannon was able to cut taxes by $1.5 billion, hire 500 more police officers in the state and win increased funding for schools and extended health insurance for poor families. He also signed landmark legislation creating the AMBER Alert program in Indiana, as well as legislation requiring drivers to slow or change lanes for emergency vehicles stopped along Hoosier roadways.\n\nIn the years of 1998 and 1999 O'Bannon served as the Chairman of Midwestern Governors Association. In 1999, O'Bannon created the Public Access Counselor Office by executive order after a statewide collaboration of seven newspapers found great obstacles in obtaining government information in Indiana. In 1999, the Indiana General Assembly established it by statute.\n\nIn 2000 he won an easy re-election bid under the theme of Keeping Indiana Moving in the Right Direction. His campaign featured memorable advertisements with O'Bannon reprising his basketball past by shooting a perfect jump shot.\n\nAfter the 9/11 disaster and subsequent market downturn, Indiana lost 120,000 jobs, tax revenues dropped, and O'Bannon had to cut social services and other services in order to spare education. In 2001 he worked with the state legislature to formulate a major restructuring of the state tax system. His opponents blamed him for various problems arising in the second term, including a slow response by his environmental agency to a big fish kill, and problems at two state centers for the developmentally disabled.\n\nHis record, however, was firmly established as an educational leader for the state. He helped lead development of Indiana's first community college system, pushed for early-childhood learning opportunities, development of alternative high schools, and charter schools. His work as chair of the state's landmark Education Roundtable ensured that Indiana was one of only five states whose schools immediately qualified as meeting all standards set by the federal No Child Left Behind act upon enactment.\n\nO'Bannon suffered a massive stroke on September 8, 2003, while he was in Chicago, Illinois, attending the U.S. Midwest–Japan trade conference. He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where he remained unconscious.\n\nOn September 10, 2003, the Speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, B. Patrick Bauer (D-South Bend), and the President Pro Tempore of the Indiana Senate, Robert D. Garton (R-Columbus), sent official notice to the Indiana Supreme Court noting that Governor O'Bannon was incapacitated and unable to fulfill the duties of his office. As such, the court approved naming Lieutenant Governor Joe E. Kernan as acting governor.\n\nDays later, O'Bannon's condition worsened and based on his living will, his family decided to use no further means of support and care. He died on September 13, 2003, aged 73, leaving behind his wife Judy (Asmus), three children (Polly, Jennifer and Jonathan) and five grandchildren. O'Bannon donated organs (after having signed legislation making organ donation easier in Indiana), including his cornea which helped an Illinois woman regain her sight. He was cremated and buried in the O'Bannon family plot at Cedar Hill Cemetery in his hometown of Corydon, Indiana.\n\nHe was succeeded in office by Lieutenant Governor Joe E. Kernan of South Bend, who was sworn into office just hours after O'Bannon's death in an emotional ceremony.\n\nO'Bannon is the subject of the 2006 biography \"Legacy of a Governor: The Life of Indiana's Frank O'Bannon\". The book, written by former O'Bannon staffer Andrew E. Stoner, contains a foreword by his wife, Judy O'Bannon. The book was published by Rooftop Publishing, Inc. of Bloomington, Indiana.\n\nIn February 2006, a memorial bust of O'Bannon was placed outside the Indiana Statehouse Senate chambers.\n\nThe Frank O'Bannon Public Service Award is given annually by Ivy Tech Community College. The 2007 winner was former State Senator Wayne Townsend of Hartford City, the Democratic candidate for governor in 1984.\n\nIn June 2008 a memorial was created in honor of Frank O'Bannon next to the state's original capitol building in his hometown of Corydon. The memorial was built at a cost of $200,000, collected from private donations, and features a life-size statue of O'Bannon sitting on a park bench. Frank O'Bannon Elementary School located in Hammond, Indiana is named after him, as was a section of highway in southern Indiana. The O'Bannon Woods State Park in Harrison County is also named for the O'Bannon family.\n\nJudy O'Bannon resides in her husband's hometown of Corydon, Indiana, and remains active in Corydon Democratic politics and in her husband's newspaper \"The Corydon Democrat\". She endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential race, and often toured with Bill Clinton throughout the state during the 2008 Democratic primary campaign. During the general election she backed Barack Obama for president. She was the vice chair for Jim Schellinger's unsuccessful campaign for governor. She has hosted a statewide public television program, \"Communities Building Community.\" In November 2013, she married Donald Willsey.\n\n\n"}

Melges (2 December 1935 – 29 July 1988) was an American psychiatrist and professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine, notable for his interest in time and for his pioneering work on the role of distortions of time in various psychiatric disorders.\n\nMelges led research work at Stanford University in the 1970s on cannabis users. Melges and colleagues were the first to report that cannabis induced \"temporal disintegration\" or a disorganization of sequential thought and impaired goal-directedness. This phenomenon stems partly from impaired immediate memory. Melges and colleagues also showed that depersonalization is closely associated with the degree of temporal disintegration. This work led Melges to conclude that the disorientation in the sense of time might represent a key action of the drug from which many other effects followed.\n\nMelges went on to propose a future oriented therapy. Melges (1982, p. 35) argued that: \"Many forms of mental illness are characterized by a bleak, foreshortened or fragmented future time perspective.\" He proposed that time distortions are prevalent in psychiatric illnesses and that they can cloud the personal future of an individual distorting their view of their future and thereby disrupting goal-directed behavior. Melges's emphasis on the importance of the future in understanding mental illness provided a framework for focusing psychiatric treatment on time and the future. The most significant work to document his findings on the essential value of time and his ideas on future oriented therapy are found in his only book, \"Time and the Inner Future\" (1982).\n\nMelges suffered from Type I diabetes and at times wondered whether he would live to see his life's work completed. In his book's epilogue, Melges explains:\n\nWhile I was writing this book, my own future was under almost constant threat. The specter of death made time ever so precious.\nSince I had been conducting studies on time and the mind for 18 years, and since I had come to realize the importance of time and the personal future in clinical work with my patients, I had a great desire to complete this book before I died.\nThe year that I started the first draft was the very year that the long-term complications of my juvenile diabetes began to take their greatest toll. (p. 289)\n\nDuring his battle with diabetes, Melges's kidneys failed, and required a transplant, which at the age of 43 was donated to him by his mother. Melges died years later, in 1988.\n\n\n"}

He was an ethicist, a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Biology (since 1994), and a founding member of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences. He was an officer of the International Society for Human Ethology. Caton held a National Humanities Fellowship at the National Humanities Center in 1982–83. He was the inaugural Professor of Humanities at Griffith University in Brisbane, and later the Professor of Politics and History and Head of the School of Applied Ethics there.\n\nCaton studied at the University of Chicago and received a PhD degree from Yale, with an (earned) D.Litt degree from Griffith University for his work in modern history.\n\nCaton's work has been concerned with ethics in the sciences (particularly in life sciences and medicine), the history of ideas, and on biological bases for individual, social, and political behaviour. He has published some 175 articles, across six or seven fields—medical ethics and bioethics, human ethology, modern political and economic history, anthropology (with special attention to the Freeman-Mead controversy), philosophy (with emphasis on rationalism and positivism), crowd studies, identity psychology, and problems of the integration of biological/evolutionary factors into the social sciences, especially political science.\n\nHe achieved notoriety as an AIDS denialist in the mid-1990s for his book \"The AIDS Mirage\" (1994), in which he charged Donald Francis with \"inventing a viral epidemic\" in 1982 at the Centers for Disease Control. He also wrote \"The Politics of Progress: The Origins and Development of the Commercial Republic, 1600–1835\" in which he explores what he considers to be the political forces surrounding the application of technology to subduing nature. Modern science, he argues, was born more from these political forces than from the ideological ones (such as the Protestant Reformation) that he feels are more usually credited with it.\n\nThe book was reviewed in more than 20 professional journals. Some reviewers stressed that it set forth a new interpretation of what drove the creation of capitalism, partly by tapping little-known historical sources. In it, Caton attributes the key phase to events and leaders in France, the Netherlands, and England in the 1650–1700 period. It offers interpretations of the French Revolution, of the founding of the United States of America, of Adam Smith's \"Wealth of Nations\", and of the origin of the legend of wicked capitalism. Caton argues that Smith's conception of economics was pre-industrial (it failed to recognise that industrial technology had become a commodity) and states that the wicked capitalism legend was created in the 1820–1840 period by a clique of factory owners. In the book, Caton rejects the belief that the human species is evolving to a higher type.\n\nIn \"The Origin of Subjectivity: An Essay on Descartes\", Caton argues that Descartes based his epistemology on optics ('optical epistemology'); and that he used his metaphysics 'as a flag to cover the goods'-- a rationalist philosophy dedicated to 'the mastery and possession of nature'.\n\nCaton's publications on Margaret Mead, Derek Freeman, and the Samoa controversy are part of the standard literature. His edited volume, \"The Samoa Reader: Anthropologists Take Stock\", remains the one comprehensive reader on the subject. Among his contributions to the volume are two studies on Freeman's psychology. They were featured in 2005 in a lead article in the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\". Also in 2005, Caton was a consultant to the BBC for its documentary on the Freeman-Mead controversy, \"Tales from the Jungle\".\n\nHis last work focused on Charles Darwin. As a former officer of the International Society of Human Ethology, he worked to integrate the Society into the web of activities celebrating the bicentenary of Darwin's birth (2009). Caton also published a reinterpretation of Darwin's contribution to the establishment of evolution. He has also devised a new interpretation of Darwin's famous illness, which he presented at the ISHE conference in Detroit, August 2006. This research was to be included in \"The Darwin Legend\". Caton was an evolutionist skeptical of Darwinian mechanisms, and was also a catastrophist. \nCaton contributed a paper to a young earth creationist journal on the evolutionary basis for eugenics, the Holocaust, and euthanasia. There is no indication that Caton was a creationist.\n\n\n"}

After being elected to a tenth term in November 2006, Hunter died on January 7, 2007, before the new legislature convened. He was born in Washington, D.C.\n\nHis son, Howard J. Hunter III, sought to replace his father in the seat, but local Democratic Party leaders instead nominated retired court clerk Annie Mobley. The younger Hunter was eventually elected to the House, in 2014.\n\n"}

An ardent socialist and a Zionist, he remained a backbencher throughout his four decades in the House of Commons. He was a member of National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 1950–59 and 1960–78, and Chairman of the Labour Party in 1970–1971. He was also Chairman of the International Committee of the Labour Party in 1973–78, Vice-President of the Socialist International (1978–1983) and Honorary President (1983–1993).\n\nMikardo was a Labour Member of Parliament for Reading 1945–50, Reading South 1950–55, Reading 1955–59, Poplar 1964–74, Bethnal Green and Bow 1974–83 and Bow and Poplar 1983–87. He was Chairman of the House of Commons Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, 1966–70. He issued many pamphlets, the most famous were \"Keep Left\" (1947) and \"Keeping Left\" with Dick Crossman, Michael Foot and Jo Richardson, 1950. He was also a Fabian essayist, staunch friend of Israel, as well as friend and mentor to many in the Labour movement, where he made a great impact.\n\nHis parents were Jewish refugees from the Tsarist Empire. His mother, Bluma 'Bloomah' (died 1961 in Hampshire) came from a town called Yampil, Khmelnytskyi Oblast in the Volyn region, of the Western Ukraine. His father, Moshe 'Morris' (died 1940 in Hampshire) came from Kutno, a textile-manufacturing town west of Warsaw. They came to East End of London separately around 1900, and married some years later. They worked as tailors and in 1907 moved to Portsmouth where they were employed repairing uniforms for the Royal Navy. Mikardo was born there in 1908. He had two brothers, Sidney Mikardo (1915-1999) and Norman Mikardo. His brother (Neville) Norman Mikardo (1924–2004), a mechanical engineer, was a Labour Party councillor for Tokyngton Ward of Brent South, from 1978–82. His niece Barbara Tayler (1931–2012) was a publisher, writer and political activist. Mikardo became a surrogate father to her after her father died when she was two years old.\n\nWhen he began school aged three, his lack of English words made him the butt of jokes. His parents spoke Yiddish.\nHe attended The Old Beneficiary School known as \"The Old Benny\", in Portsea, Portsmouth, and the Omega Street School in Portsmouth. In 1919, he came top in Portsmouth's pass-list for the 11-plus, and went to Portsmouth Southern Grammar School for Boys. From the age of eleven he also attended Aria College, a rabbinical seminary. However the life of a cleric was not for him and he transferred to Portsmouth Grammar School. At this time he followed Portsmouth FC and he had an encyclopedic knowledge of all their matches.\n\nConcerned by injustice and inequality from boyhood, Mikardo was influenced by the works of R. H. Tawney and George Bernard Shaw in his teens. He attended political lectures at various clubs and societies in London in the 1920s, principally amongst the Jewish community. He joined both the Labour Party and Poale Zion, the Zionist workers' movement affiliated to the Labour Party. He was already a Zionist, and had given his first public speech at a meeting of the Portsmouth Zionist Society in 1922, aged 13.\n\nAfter leaving school, Mikardo settled in Stepney, where he had a variety of jobs. In 1930 he met Mary (b. 1907), the daughter of Benjamin Rosetsky. They married at Mile End and Bow District synagogue on 3 January 1932, and Mary joined the Labour Party and Poale Zion. They had two daughters by 1936. Mary suffered a heart attack in 1959 which was progressively disabling. She died in Cheshire in 1994, a few months after him.\n\nHe studied scientific management, but was sceptical and developed his own theories. He became a freelance management consultant and during the Second World War, worked on increasing efficiency in aircraft and armaments manufacturing, principally at Woodley Aerodrome in Reading. He was treasurer of the World Airways Joint Committee of National Air Communications.\n\nAfter settling in Reading at the end of the war he was selected by the local Constituency Labour Party for the 1945 general election, beating James Callaghan and Austen Albu. On every topic, the National Health Service, education, social deprivation, nationalisation or socialism, he was seen as an inspiration to others. Mik, as he introduced himself, showed he had planned where he was going and the constituency members wanted to go with him. His integrity was obvious and beguiling, quite rare amongst professional politicians.\n\nHe was elected Member of Parliament for Reading constituency overturning a large Conservative majority. Labour's effective get out the vote campaign used in this election was universally adopted and came to be known as the Reading system. He held Reading, which became a highly marginal seat, until the 1959 general election when he was ousted by Peter Emery of the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians, later the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs and Manufacturing Science and Finance trade union. Ian Mikardo Way, a road in Lower Caversham, Reading, commemorates his role as the town's MP.\n\nMikardo was a member of the left wing of the Labour Party throughout his political career, writing for \"Tribune\". In the post-war period the Fabian Society was at the heart of Labour and social democratic thinking, and Mikardo contributed to the New Fabian Essays of 1952, edited by Anthony Crosland. These helped to reinvigorate debate on the left after the fall of the Attlee government. Other contributors included Roy Jenkins, Richard Crossman and Denis Healey.\n\nMikardo's secretary at the time was Jo Richardson (1923–94) who began her political career working for him and later became a Member of Parliament herself. She co-ordinated the 'Keep Left Group' and went on to become the secretary of the Tribune Group. In 1951 Richardson was elected to Hornsey Borough Council and became the full-time secretary and working partner of Mikardo in his business, which involved trade with eastern Europe. In February 1958 Mikardo joined Stephen Swingler, Richardson, Harold Davies, Konni Zilliacus, Walter Monslow and Sydney Silverman, to form Victory for Socialism (VFS), which was co-ordinated by Richardson.\n\nMikardo was defeated in his Reading seat in 1959 but won Poplar in the General Election of 1964, representing the area of London where his parents had first settled. As the constituencies were reorganised over time, he went on to represent Bethnal Green and Bow from 1974 until 1983 and the Bow and Poplar from 1983 until his retirement from Parliament in 1987. Mikardo served as member of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party from 1950–59 and 1960–78. He was also chairman of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries 1966–70 and Chairman of the Labour Party 1970–71.\n\nIn February 1973 Mikardo joined James Callaghan, Shadow Foreign Secretary, and Tom McNally, Secretary, International Department in an official Labour Party delegation visiting the Far East. On 27 March 1974 Mikardo, having already served as Chairman of the Labour Party, was elected chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, defeating a candidate from the right of the party, Arthur Bottomley, by 99–85 votes. A necessarily anonymous and discerning experienced clerk of the House of Commons remarked 'Ian Mikardo was simply the most skillful operator in committee that any of us ever saw.' Within Parliament, he was known as the Commons' bookmaker, willing to take bets on all manner of political events.\n\nIn early 1947 a small number of the 'King's Speech dissenters' in the Labour Party formed the 'Keep Left' group and met on a regular basis during that year. Along with Richard Crossman, Michael Foot and Konni Zilliacus, Mikardo published a pamphlet of the same name in May 1947 in which the authors criticized the United States cold war policies and urged a closer relationship with Europe in order to create a \"Third Force\" in politics. This included the idea of nuclear disarmament and the formation of a European Security Treaty. During the period of office of Clement Attlee's Labour government, the Keep Left group attempted, through discussion and pamphlets, to produce practical proposals informed by socialist values. The group survived until April 1951. After that month's ministerial resignations it became one element within the much larger Bevanite faction.\n\nKeep Left's concern was with modernisation and socialist ethics. This was evident in Harold Wilson's governments in the 1960s. Such sentiments contributed to ministerial conflicts with the trade unions over incomes policy and most thoroughly over Barbara Castle's proposals for trade union reform. The vision of a more rational and ethical society discussed by a group of talented young politicians two decades earlier was at odds with sentiments deeply rooted in their party.\n\nThe Mikardo Committee on the docks was set up by the Labour Party. Mikardo served on it, along with Andrew Cunningham, leader of the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union (GMB) in north-east England, John Hughes, of Ruskin College, Oxford, Jack Jones, later general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union then directly responsible for dockers, Michael Montague, later of the English Tourist Board, and Peter Shore MP.\n\nA report in March 1965 exposed the problems of the docks industry. It recommended total restructuring of the docks under public ownership and with a system of decentralisation and workers' participation in management wider than for any other industry. The 1966 Labour Cabinet accepted the report. George Brown fought hard for it against ministerial resistance. However, the Labour government was unable to produce the Ports Bill until the last session of that parliament. The Bill when it came was a disappointment it was a long way short of implementing the proposals. Had the committee's proposals been put into practice, the seamen's strike and its crippling effect on the economy might have been avoided. Sourness was created in the Labour movement by suggestions of 'Reds under the bed'. It created the conditions for Labour's defeat in 1970.\n\nMikardo outlined in the House of Commons attempts by some members of the Parliamentary Select Committee, of which he was a member, to find the truth about the sinking of the Belgrano during the Falklands War.\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Select Committee's minority report was published in 1984. Mikardo complained that dogmatic views were being expressed. He stated that he had spent months going through all the evidence, but still could not make up his mind about the truth. He complained that other members who had not looked at all the evidence could not be so sure and dogmatic. He complained that information was being withheld and this would devalue its work and its report. Mikardo accused the Government of lying to the House, to the Select Committee and to the country. This followed revelations from the trial of Clive Ponting. He also stated that a civil servant had advised Ministers to deceive the Select Committee by withholding information. Mikardo quoted one of the reasons given for withholding, namely that the rules of engagement would have to be paraphrased considerably or they would be almost incomprehensible to the layman. Mikardo stated that the rules had been given to the War Cabinet whose members were all laymen and the rules had been fully understood by them. The Secretary of State subsequently agreed that it was nonsense and he had now given the rules to the Select Committee.\n\nMikardo stated that a number of people had said that they could not understand why the Government had prosecuted Clive Ponting (who had been acquitted). Mikardo stated that the Government's lying to the House of Commons was in the national interest. He stated that they wanted to protect themselves against criticism from the Select Committee, and others, and to be able to say that, however reprehensible, it was done in the national interest. Mikardo stated that the acquittal of Ponting got rid of that. Twelve British citizens had dismissed the judge's opinion, shared by the Prime Minister and some of her Ministers, that the national interest is whatever the Government of the day want to do. Mikardo stated: \"That is a monstrous doctrine, because if confers on a Government a cachet of papal infallibility. I do not doubt that all Governments do what they judge to be in the national interest, but no Government have the right to assume that their judgment can never be wrong. No Government should assume that they can never be wrong and that what they do cannot sometimes therefore vary from the national interest. As has been said, that is the cherished doctrine of General Pinochet and of General Jaruzelski. It is the codex of all courts in police states. Before the time of our present Prime Minister and Mr Justice McCowan, that doctrine was unheard of in our country.\"\n\nJohn Browne (MP for Winchester) asked: \"What greater test can any Government face than to fight a military campaign and have a disloyal adviser in a key area of defence? I am reminded of the betrayal of the Spartans at Thermopylae to the Persians. In what other country would the Government have to balance disclosure against national security in such a blaze of examination, comment and publicity?\"\n\nMikardo responded: \"The United States.\"\n\nBrowne: \"No, not the President.\"\n\nMikardo: \"Yes.\" (Sinking of the General Belgrano, Hansard, 18 February 1985) See also: ARA General Belgrano: Controversy over the sinking\n\nMikardo and his wife were immersed in Jewish causes and help for Israel, which they often visited. He worked with Mapam, the Israeli United Workers' Party, and abhorred gratuitous provocation of the Palestinian Arabs. Instances include:\n\n\n\nMikardo died, age 84, on 6 May 1993 from a stroke, whilst being treated for sarcoma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport, Cheshire. He was survived by his wife Mary and daughters Ruth and Judy.\n\nIan Mikardo High School in Bow is named after him.\n\n\n"}

Matthys baptized thousands of converts, and after Hoffman's imprisonment, rose to prominent leadership among the Anabaptists. Matthys rejected the pacifism and non-violence theology of Hoffman, adopting a view that oppression must be met with resistance.\n\nIn 1534, an Anabaptist insurrection took control of Münster, the capital city of the Holy Roman Empire's Prince-Bishopric of Münster. John of Leiden, a Dutch Anabaptist disciple of Matthys, and a group of local merchants, summoned Matthys to come. Matthys identified Münster as the \"New Jerusalem\", and on January 5, 1534, a number of his disciples entered the city and introduced adult baptism.

{"id": "997014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=997014", "title": "Jeanne Baret", "text": "Jeanne Baret\n\nJeanne Baret (sometimes spelled Baré or Barret) (July 27, 1740 – August 5, 1807) was a member of Louis Antoine de Bougainville's expedition on the ships \"La Boudeuse\" and \"Étoile\" in 1766–1769. Baret is recognized as the first woman to have completed a voyage of circumnavigation of the globe.\n\nJeanne Baret joined the expedition disguised as a man, calling herself Jean Baret. She enlisted as valet and assistant to the expedition's naturalist, Philibert Commerçon (anglicized as Commerson), shortly before Bougainville's ships sailed from France. According to Bougainville's account, Baret was herself an expert botanist.\n\nJeanne Baret was born on July 27, 1740, in the village of La Comelle in the Burgundy region of France. Her record of baptism survives and identifies her as the legitimate issue of Jean Baret and Jeanne Pochard. Her father is identified as a day laborer and seems likely to have been illiterate, as he did not sign the parish register.\n\nNothing definitive is known of Baret's childhood or young adulthood. She later told Bougainville that she had been orphaned and lost her fortune in a lawsuit before taking to disguising herself as a man. While she might well have been an orphan given the low life expectancies of the time, historians agree that other details of the story she gave Bougainville were a fabrication to shield Commerson from complicity in her disguise. Burgundy was at this time one of the more backward provinces of France in terms of the condition of the peasant classes, and it is likely that Baret's family was quite impoverished.\n\nOne of the mysteries of Baret's life is how she obtained at least the rudiments of an education, as her signature on later legal documents provides evidence that she was not illiterate. One of her biographers, Glynis Ridley, suggests that her mother might have been of Huguenot extraction, a group that had a higher tradition of literacy than was otherwise typical of the peasant classes of the time. Another biographer, John Dunmore, suggests that she was taught by the parish priest or taken on as a charity case by a member of the local gentry.\n\nAt some point between 1760 and 1764, Baret became employed as housekeeper to Commerson, who had settled in Toulon-sur-Arroux, some 20 km to the south of La Comelle, upon his marriage in 1760. Commerson's wife, who was the sister of the parish priest, died shortly after giving birth to a son in April 1762, and it seems most likely that Baret took over management of Commerson's household at that time, if not before.\n\nIt is also evident that Baret and Commerson shared a more personal relationship, as Baret became pregnant in 1764. French law at that time required women who became pregnant out of wedlock to obtain a \"certificate of pregnancy\" in which they could name the father of their unborn child. Baret's certificate, from August 1764, survives; it was filed in a town 30 km away and witnessed by two men of substance who likewise had travelled a considerable distance from their homes. She refused to name the father of her child, but historians do not doubt that it was Commerson and that it was Commerson who had also made the arrangements with the lawyer and witnesses on her behalf.\n\nShortly afterwards, Baret and Commerson moved together to Paris, where she continued in the role of his housekeeper.\nBaret apparently changed her name to \"Jeanne de Bonnefoy\" during this period. Her child, born in December 1764, was given the name Jean-Pierre Baret. Baret gave the child up to the Paris Foundlings Hospital. He was quickly placed with a foster mother but died in the summer of 1765. (Commerson had left his legitimate son from his marriage in the care of his brother-in-law in Toulon-sur-Arroux and never saw him again in his lifetime.)\n\nIn 1765, Commerson was invited to join Bougainville's expedition. He hesitated in accepting because he was often in poor health; he required Baret's assistance as a nurse as well as in running his household and managing his collections and papers. His appointment allowed him a servant, paid as a royal expense, but women were completely prohibited on French navy ships at this time. At some point, the idea of Baret disguising herself as a man in order to accompany Commerson was conceived. To avoid scrutiny, she was to join the expedition immediately before the ship sailed, pretending to be a stranger to Commerson.\n\nBefore leaving Paris, Commerson drew up a will in which he left to \"Jeanne Baret, known as de Bonnefoi, my housekeeper\", a lump sum of 600 livres along with back wages owed and the furnishings of their Paris apartment. Thus, while the story Baret concocted for Bougainville's benefit to explain her presence on board ship was carefully designed to shield Commerson from involvement, there is clear documentary evidence of their previous relationship, and it is highly improbable that Commerson was not complicit in the plan himself.\n\nBaret and Commerson joined the Bougainville expedition at the port of Rochefort in late December 1766. They were assigned to sail on the storeship, the \"Étoile\". Because of the vast quantity of equipment Commerson was bringing on the voyage, the ship's captain, François Chesnard de la Giraudais, gave up his own large cabin on the ship to Commerson and his \"assistant\". This gave Baret significantly more privacy than she would have had otherwise on board the crowded ship. In particular, the captain's cabin gave Baret access to private toilet facilities so that she did not have to use the shared head with other members of the crew.\nIn addition to Bougainville's published account, Baret's story figures in three other surviving memoirs of the expedition: a journal kept jointly by Commerson and Pierre Duclos-Guyot; a journal by the Prince of Nassau-Siegen, a paying passenger on the \"Boudeuse\"; and a memoir by François Vivès, surgeon on the \"Étoile\". Vivès has the most to say about Baret, but his memoir is problematical because he and Commerson were on bad terms throughout the voyage, and his account – largely written or revised after the fact – is full of innuendo and spiteful comments directed at both Commerson and Baret.\n\nCommerson suffered badly from both seasickness and a recurring ulcer on his leg in the early part of the voyage, and Baret probably spent most of her time attending to him. Aside from the ceremony of \"crossing the line\", which Commerson described in some detail in his memoir, there was little for the botanists to do until the \"Étoile\" reached Montevideo. There they set out on expeditions to the surrounding plains and mountains. Commerson's leg was still troubling him, and Baret seems to have done much of the actual labor, carrying supplies and specimens. In Rio de Janeiro – a much more dangerous place, where the \"Étoile\"s chaplain was murdered ashore soon after their arrival – Commerson was officially confined to the ship while his leg healed, but he and Baret nonetheless collected specimens of a flowering vine, which he named \"Bougainvillea\".\n\nAfter a second visit to Montevideo, their next opportunity to collect plants was in Patagonia while the ships of the expedition were waiting for favorable winds to carry them through the Strait of Magellan. Here Baret accompanied Commerson on the most troublesome excursions over rugged terrain and gained a reputation for courage and strength. Commerson, still hampered by his leg injury, referred to Baret as his \"beast of burden\" on these expeditions. In addition to the manual labor she performed in collecting plants, stones, and shells, Baret also helped Commerson organize and catalog their specimens and notes in the weeks that followed, as the ships entered the Pacific.\n\nSurviving accounts of the expedition differ on when Baret's gender was first discovered. According to Bougainville, rumors that Baret was a woman had circulated for some time, but her gender was not finally confirmed until the expedition reached Tahiti in April 1768. As soon as she and Commerson landed on shore, Baret was immediately surrounded by Tahitians who cried out that she was a woman. It was necessary to return her to the ship to protect her from the excited Tahitians. Bougainville recorded this incident in his journal some weeks after it happened, when he had an opportunity to visit the \"Étoile\" to interview Baret personally.\n\nIn his account, Vivès reports much speculation about Baret's gender early in the voyage and asserts that Baret claimed to be a eunuch when confronted directly by La Giraudais (whose own official log has not survived). Bougainville's account of Baret's unmasking on Tahiti is not corroborated by the other journal accounts of the expedition, although Vivès describes a similar incident in which Baret was immediately pointed out as a woman by the Tahitian Ahu-toru on board the ship. Vivès also describes a different incident on New Ireland in mid-July in which Baret was caught off-guard, stripped, and \"examined\" by a group of other servants on the expedition. Duclos-Guyot and Nassau-Siegen also recorded that Baret had been discovered to be a woman on New Ireland, but without mentioning details.\n\nAhu-toru travelled back to France with the expedition and was subsequently questioned at some length about Baret. Modern scholars now believe that Ahu-toru actually thought that Baret was a transvestite, or \"mahu\". However, other Tahitian natives reported the presence of a woman in Bougainville's expedition to later visitors to the island, including James Cook in 1769 and Domingo de Bonechea in 1772, which indicates that her gender was known to the Tahitians if not to her shipmates at the time she visited the island.\n\nAfter crossing the Pacific, the expedition was desperately short of food. After a brief stop for supplies in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), the ships made a longer stop at the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. This island, known as Isle de France, was then an important French trading station. Commerson was delighted to find that his old friend and fellow botanist Pierre Poivre was serving as governor on the island, and Commerson and Baret remained behind as Poivre's guests. Probably Bougainville also actively encouraged this arrangement, as it allowed him to rid himself of the problem of a woman illegally on board his expedition.\n\nOn Mauritius, Baret continued in her role as Commerson's assistant and housekeeper. It is likely that she accompanied him in plant-collecting on Madagascar and Bourbon Island in 1770–1772. Commerson continued to have serious health problems, and he died in Mauritius in February 1773. His financial resources on the island had dwindled, his patron Poivre had been recalled to Paris, and Baret was left without the means to immediately return to France to claim the money due her from Commerson's will.\n\nAfter Commerson's death, Baret seems to have found work running a tavern in Port Louis for a time. Then, on May 17, 1774, she married Jean Dubernat, a non-commissioned officer in the French Army who was most likely on the island on his way home to France.\n\nThere is no record of exactly when Baret and her husband arrived in France, thus completing her voyage of circumnavigation. Most likely it was sometime in 1775. In April 1776, she received the money that was due to her under Commerson's will after applying directly to the Attorney General. With this money, she settled with Dubernat in his native village of Saint-Aulaye where he possibly became the blacksmith.\n\nIn 1785, Baret was granted a pension of 200 livres a year by the Ministry of Marine. The document granting her this pension makes clear the high regard with which she was held by this point:\n\nJeanne Barré, by means of a disguise, circumnavigated the globe on one of the vessels commanded by Mr de Bougainville. She devoted herself in particular to assisting Mr de Commerson, doctor and botanist, and shared with great courage the labours and dangers of this savant. Her behaviour was exemplary and Mr de Bougainville refers to it with all due credit... His Lordship has been gracious enough to grant to this extraordinary woman a pension of two hundred livres a year to be drawn from the fund for invalid servicemen and this pension shall be payable from 1 January 1785.\n\nShe died in Saint-Aulaye on August 5, 1807, at the age of 67.\n\nCommerson named many of the plants he collected after friends and acquaintances. One of them, a tall shrub with dark green leaves and white flowers that he found on Madagascar, he named \"Baretia bonafidia\". But Commerson's name for this genus did not survive, as it had already been named by the time his reports reached Paris; it is currently known as Turraea. While over seventy species are named in honor of Commerson, only one, \"Solanum \", honors Baret.\n\nThe New York Botanical Garden includes a plant specimen, attributed to Comerson but believed to be collected by Baret with him, in their herbarium. \n\nFor many years, Bougainville's published journal – a popular bestseller in its day, in English translation as well as the original French – was the only widely available source of information about Baret. More recent scholarship has uncovered additional facts and documentation about her life, but much of the new information remained little-known and inaccessible to the general public, particularly outside France. The first English-language biography of Baret, by John Dunmore, was not published until 2002, and then only in New Zealand. Other articles appeared only in scholarly journals.\n\nThe 2010 biography of Baret by Glynis Ridley, \"The Discovery of Jeanne Baret\", brought Baret to the attention of a wider audience and helped to overturn some of the old misconceptions about her life. However, Ridley's biography has also been highly criticized by some reviewers for its reliance on improbable chains of speculation that are not corroborated by any other primary or secondary sources.\n"}
{"id": "16017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16017", "title": "Joanna Russ", "text": "Joanna Russ\n\nJoanna Russ (February 22, 1937 – April 29, 2011) was an American writer, academic and radical feminist. She is the author of a number of works of science fiction, fantasy and feminist literary criticism such as \"How to Suppress Women's Writing\", as well as a contemporary novel, \"On Strike Against God\", and one children's book, \"Kittatinny\". She is best known for \"The Female Man\", a novel combining utopian fiction and satire, and the story \"When It Changed\".\n\nJoanna Russ was born in The Bronx, New York City, to Evarett I. and Bertha (née Zinner) Russ, both teachers. She began creating works of fiction at a very early age. Over the following years she filled countless notebooks with stories, poems, comics and illustrations, often hand-binding the material with thread.\n\nAs a senior at William Howard Taft High School, Russ was selected as one of the top ten Westinghouse Science Talent Search winners. She graduated from Cornell University, where she studied with Vladimir Nabokov, in 1957, and received her MFA from the Yale Drama School in 1960. After teaching at several universities, including Cornell, she became a full professor at the University of Washington.\n\nRuss came to be noticed in the science fiction world in the late 1960s, in particular for her award-nominated novel \"Picnic on Paradise.\" At the time, SF was a field dominated by male authors, writing for a predominantly male audience, but women were starting to enter the field in larger numbers. Russ, an out lesbian, was one of the most outspoken authors to challenge male dominance of the field, and is generally regarded as one of the leading feminist science fiction scholars and writers. She was also one of the first major science fiction writers to take slash fiction and its cultural and literary implications seriously. Over the course of her life, she published over fifty short stories. Russ was associated with the American New Wave of science fiction.\n\nAlong with her work as a writer of prose fiction, Russ was also a playwright, essayist, and author of nonfiction works, generally literary criticism and feminist theory, including the essay collection \"Magic Mommas, Trembling Sisters, Puritans & Perverts\"; \"How to Suppress Women's Writing\"; and the book-length study of modern feminism, \"What Are We Fighting For?\". Her essays and articles have been published in \"Women's Studies Quarterly\", \"Signs\", \"Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies\", \"Science Fiction Studies\", and \"College English\". Russ was a self-described socialist feminist, expressing particular admiration for the work and theories of Clara Fraser and her Freedom Socialist Party. Both fiction and nonfiction, for Russ, were modes of engaging theory with the real world; in particular, \"The Female Man\" can be read as a theoretical or narrative text. The short story, \"When It Changed,\" which became a part of the novel, explores the constraints of gender and asks if gender is necessary in a society.\n\nRuss's writing is characterized by anger interspersed with humor and irony. James Tiptree Jr, in a letter to her, wrote, \"Do you imagine that anyone with half a functional neuron can read your work and not have his fingers smoked by the bitter, multi-layered anger in it? It smells and smoulders like a volcano buried so long and deadly it is just beginning to wonder if it can explode.\" In a letter to Susan Koppelman, Russ asks of a young feminist critic \"where is her anger?\" and adds \"I think from now on, I will not trust anyone who isn't angry.\"\n\nFor nearly 15 years she was an influential (if intermittent) review columnist for \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\". Though by then she was no longer an active member of science fiction fandom, she was interviewed by phone during Wiscon (the feminist science fiction convention in Madison, Wisconsin) in 2006 by her friend and member of the same cohort, Samuel R. Delany.\n\nHer first SF story was \"Nor Custom Stale\" in F&SF (1959). Notable short works include Hugo winner and Nebula Award finalist \"Souls\" (1982), Nebula Award and Tiptree Award winner \"When It Changed\" (1972), Nebula Award finalists \"The Second Inquisition\" (1970), \"Poor Man, Beggar Man\" (1971), \"The Extraordinary Voyages of Amélie Bertrand\" (1979), and \"The Mystery of the Young Gentlemen\" (1982). Her fiction has been nominated for nine Nebula and three Hugo Awards, and her genre-related scholarly work was recognized with a Pilgrim Award in 1988. Her story \"The Autobiography of My Mother\" was one of the 1977 O. Henry Prize stories.\n\nShe wrote several contributions to feminist thinking about pornography and sexuality including \"Pornography by Women, for Women, with Love\" (1985), \"Pornography and the Doubleness of Sex for Women\", and \"Being Against Pornography\", which can be found in her archival pieces located in the University of Oregon's Special Collections.\n\nThese essays include very detailed descriptions of her views on pornography and how influential it was to feminist thought in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Specifically, in \"Being Against Pornography\", she calls pornography a feminist issue. She sees pornography to be the essence of evil in society, calling it \"a monolithic, easily recognizable, uniquely evil essence; and at the same time, commercially available, explicit, sexual fantasy.\" Her issues with pornography range from feminist issues, to women's sexuality in general and how porn prevents women from freely express their sexual selves, like men can. Russ believed that anti-pornography activists were not addressing how women experienced pornography created by men, a topic that she addressed in \"Being Against Pornography\", she directly addresses the issue in her multiple published and unpublished essays.\n\nHer work is widely taught in courses on science fiction and feminism throughout the English speaking world. Russ is the subject of Farah Mendlesohn's book \"On Joanna Russ\" and Jeanne Cortiel's \"Demand My Writing: Joanna Russ, Feminism, Science Fiction\". Russ and her work are prominently featured in Sarah LeFanu's\" Chinks in the World Machine: Feminism and Science Fiction\" (1988). She was named to the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nHer papers are part of the University of Oregon's Special Collections and University Archives.\n\nThe late 1960s and 1970s marked the beginnings of feminist SF scholarship—a field of inquiry that was all but created single-handedly by Russ, who contributed many essays on feminism and science fiction that appeared in journals such as \"College English\" and \"Science Fiction Studies\". She also contributed 25 reviews to the \"Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\", covering more than 100 books of all genres. In their article \"Learning the 'Prophet Business': The Merril-Russ Intersection,\" Newell and Tallentire described Russ as an \"intelligent, tough-minded reviewer who routinely tempered harsh criticism with just the sort of faint praise she handed out to Judith Merril\", who in turn was among the foremost editors and critics in American science fiction in the late 1960s. Russ was also described as a fearless, incisive, and radical person, whose writing was often characterized as acerbic and angry.\n\nRuss was acclaimed as one of science fiction's most revolutionary and accomplished writers. Helen Merrick went so far as to claim that Russ was an inescapable figure in science fiction history. James Tiptree, Jr. once commented on how Russ could be an \"absolute delight\" one minute, but then she \"rushes out and bites my ankles with one sentence\". For example, Russ criticized Ursula K. Le Guin's 1969 \"The Left Hand of Darkness\", which won both the 1969 Nebula and 1970 Hugo awards for best science fiction novel, arguing that gender discriminations that permeated science fiction by men showed up just as frequently in science fiction by women. According to Russ, Le Guin's novel represented these stereotypes.\n\nHowever, Russ was well aware of the pressures of writing for a living since she was also an author herself. Russ also felt that science fiction gives something to its readers that cannot be easily acquired anywhere else. She maintained that science should be accurate, and seriousness is a virtue. She insisted on the unique qualities of her chosen genre, maintaining that science fiction shared certain qualities with art and its flexibility compared to other forms writing. Russ was also interested in demonstrating the unique potentials of women science fiction writers. As her career moved into its second decade in the 1980s, she started to worry about reviewing standards. She once said, \"The reviewer's hardest task is to define standards.\"\n\nRuss's reviewing style was characterized by anger. She was attacked by readers because of her harsh reviews of Stephen R. Donaldson's \"Lord Foul's Bane\" (1977) and Joy Chant's \"The Grey Mane of Morning\" (1977). She organized attacks into these seven categories, taken directly from the cited article:\n\nHowever, she felt guilty about dire and frank criticism. She apologized for her harsh words on Lloyd Biggle's \"The Light That Never Was\" (1972) by saying, \"It's narsty to beat up on authors who are probably starving to death on turnip soup (ghoti soup) but critics ought to be honest.\"\n\nIn her later life she published little, largely due to chronic pain and chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nOn April 27, 2011, it was reported that Russ had been admitted to a hospice after suffering a series of strokes. Samuel R. Delany was quoted as saying that Russ was \"slipping away\" and had long had a \"do not resuscitate\" order on file. She died early in the morning on April 29, 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "182879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182879", "title": "John Constantine", "text": "John Constantine\n\nJohn Constantine () is a fictional antihero, appearing in comic books published by DC Comics and its alternative imprint Vertigo. The character first appeared in \"The Saga of Swamp Thing\" #25 (June 1984), and was created by Alan Moore, Steve Bissette, John Totleben, Jamie Delano and John Ridgway. He serves as the lead character of the comic books \"Hellblazer\" (1988–2013), \"Constantine\" (2013–2015), \"Constantine: The Hellblazer\" (2015–2016), and \"The Hellblazer\" (2016–2018).\n\nThe titular Hellblazer, Constantine is a working class occult detective and con man stationed in London. He is known for his endless cynicism, deadpan snarking, ruthless cunning and constant chain smoking, but is also a passionate humanitarian driven by a heartfelt desire to do some good in his life. Originally a supporting character who played a pivotal role in the \"American Gothic\" \"Swamp Thing\" storyline, Constantine received his own comic in 1988. The musician Sting was visual inspiration for the character.\n\nA live-action film was released in 2005, in which an Americanized version of the character is played by actor Keanu Reeves. Welsh actor Matt Ryan was cast in the role of Constantine for the 2014 NBC television series, a role he reprised on The CW series \"Arrow\" and \"Legends of Tomorrow\", the animated film \"Justice League Dark\", and again in the \"\" series on CW Seed.\n\nThe \"Hellblazer\" series was the longest-running and most successful title of DC's Vertigo imprint. \"Empire\" ranked Constantine third in their 50 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time, while IGN ranked him No. 29 in their Top 100 Comic Book Heroes, and the character ranked No. 10 in \"Wizard\"s Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time.\n\nJohn Constantine first appeared in 1985 as a recurring character in the horror series \"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\", in which he acted as a \"supernatural advisor\" to the main character.\n\nIn these early appearances, Constantine was depicted as a sorcerer of questionable morality, whose appearance was based on that of the musician Sting (specifically, as Sting appeared in the films \"Brimstone and Treacle\" and \"Quadrophenia\"). Alan Moore created the character after artists Steve Bissette and John Totleben, who were fans of The Police, expressed a desire to draw a character who looked like Sting. They had already drawn at least one character in Sting's likeness, a briefly glimpsed background figure wearing a black-and-red-striped T-shirt in \"Swamp Thing\" #25 (1984), who was later retroactively declared to be John Constantine. In his earliest Swamp Thing appearances, the character is drawn with a marked resemblance to Sting, and in \"Swamp Thing\" #51, Constantine appears on a boat with the name \"The Honourable Gordon Sumner\" on the bow.\n\nJohn Constantine's official debut was not until \"Swamp Thing\" #37, when he was drawn by Rick Veitch. \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #4, his second official appearance in a cameo role, shipped two weeks prior to the release of Swamp Thing #37. In \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #4, written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by George Perez, Constantine is wearing a green suit as opposed to his more traditional black suit and tan trenchcoat ensemble. Moore describes Constantine as being drawn from a number of \"really good ideas... about serial killers, the Winchester House, and... want[ing] to draw Sting in a story.\" Calling these disparate strands a \"big intellectual puzzle\", Constantine was the result of \"fit[ting] it all together.\" Initially created \"purely to get Sting into the story\", by the time of the 1985 San Diego ComicCon, Moore stated that \"It's turning into something more than that now.\" Veitch's contribution was to give Constantine an earring, something he considered risque for 1985.\n\nAsked in 1985 about the similarities between John Constantine and the character Baron Winters (from Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan's \"Night Force\"), Moore revealed that he was a \"big fan\" of Wolfman and \"Night Force\", but that there was \"no intention to rip off Baron Winters\". He said:\n\nConstantine and Winters met each other during Moore's run on \"Swamp Thing\" and again in Neil Gaiman's \"The Books of Magic\".\n\nSpeaking to comics magazine \"Wizard\" in 1993, Moore elaborated:\n\nIn 1988, Constantine was given his own title, \"Hellblazer\". In 1993, at the launch of DC's Vertigo Comics imprint, \"Hellblazer\" was made an official Vertigo publication. It was the longest continuously published Vertigo title. Before the launch of the Vertigo line, Constantine appeared in several DC Universe titles, but for many years afterwards editorial policy forbade the use of Constantine outside the Vertigo line. The policy was reversed in 2011, when a version of Constantine appeared in the DC Universe crossover series \"Brightest Day\", a spin-off series, \"Brightest Day Aftermath: The Search for Swamp Thing\". In 2011, Peter Milligan added him to the inaugural roster of The New 52 series \"Justice League Dark\". Milligan began writing \"Justice League Dark\" while also writing the Vertigo's \"Hellblazer\" series, being a writer of both series at the same time. In an interview, Milligan told Newsarama:\n\nBeginning in \"Justice League Dark\" #9, Jeff Lemire assumed writing duties on the series, replacing Milligan who had remained on the Vertigo title. Lemire said he considers \"Justice League Dark\" his dream gig at DC Comics because Constantine is one of his all-time favourite characters not just in comics, but in all fiction. Lemire also teased that while Constantine, Zatanna and Deadman would remain on the roster, the team would change in his opening arc and expand.\n\nAlthough a compassionate humanist who struggles to overcome the influence of both Heaven and Hell over humanity, and despite his occasional forays into heroism, Constantine is a foul-mouthed, disillusioned, British cynic who pursues a life of sorcery and danger. His motivation has been attributed to an adrenaline addiction that only the strange and mysterious can sate. He also seems to be something of a \"Weirdness Magnet\" (a term also used to describe Blue Devil).\nConstantine is shown to be someone with a wide and international circle of contacts and allies, and is adept at making friends. At the same time, his close friends inevitably suffer or are outright killed simply by being in his life; this has left a severe mark on him. In #69, when the King of Vampires killed the man sleeping beside him and casually asked if he'd been a friend, John replied \"Must be. He's dead.\"\n\nConstantine is bisexual, which was first established in a 1992 comic which referred offhandedly to his having ex-girlfriends and ex-boyfriends. Early stories exclusively showed him dating women, although Brian Azzarello's \"Ashes & Dust in the City of Angels\" showed him as having relationships with men as well. His romantic relationships in the New 52 have included numerous partners, most significantly Zatanna, as well as the sorcerer Nick Necro; all have been fraught with distrust and mutual disappointments. The relaunch \"Constantine the Hellblazer\" #1 (2015) reaffirmed Constantine's bisexuality through his interactions with male and female characters in the issue.\n\nConstantine also has a reputation as being one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world. Despite this, Constantine rarely uses magic, instead choosing to use his wits to trick his opponents. Constantine is also referred to as \"The Constant One\" because of his whole family tree being somewhat connected to the occult. Many of his ancestors are sorcerers from different eras of history, and have taken part in many known historical events. Some of his ancestors have roles in other works outside Hellblazer, such as \"Batman: The Order of Beasts\", \"The Sandman\" and \"Books of Magic\".\n\nWhile Constantine has worn many clothes over the years, he was originally portrayed as often wearing a blue pin-stripe suit, tan trench coat, and occasionally gloves. As the series progressed, his trademark attire became a grungier (or perhaps the same, just older) trench coat, white shirt, and black tie, but eventually returned more to his earlier fashion. Constantine smokes Silk Cut cigarettes, consuming thirty or so a day. Constantine also occasionally breaks the fourth wall, where he talks to the reader and narrates the story himself.\n\nConstantine is unusual among comic book characters in that he has aged in real time since his creation. During the first year of his solo series, Constantine celebrated his 35th birthday. In the relevant issue Constantine is reading a newspaper when he notices the date on the cover is his birthday, making his date of birth May 10, 1953. Five years later, on May 10, 1993, he turned 40. In \"Hellblazer\", it was mentioned multiple times that the aging process of Constantine himself might be different due to the demon blood that he obtained from Nergal. In a 2011 interview, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio said that \"Constantine in the Vertigo universe is in his 60s, and what you have in the DC Universe is a character who is markedly younger\".\n\nIn Constantine's early appearances in \"Swamp Thing\", his past was a mystery; his life as a child and young adult was not developed until Jamie Delano's \"Hellblazer\" stories. John Constantine was born in Liverpool, Lancashire (now Merseyside) on May 10, 1953. His mother, Mary Anne, died giving birth to John and his stillborn twin brother because an earlier abortion—forced on her by John's father, Thomas—had weakened her womb. Because he was unable to accept responsibility for his wife's death, Thomas blamed John and the pair grew up with a deep dislike for one another. Whilst in the womb, John strangled his twin brother with his own umbilical cord; in a parallel universe, the twin survives to become the well-loved and well-adjusted magician that John never was.\n\nIn their childhood, John and his older sister Cheryl lived briefly with their aunt and uncle in Northampton to escape from their father's alcoholism and subsequent imprisonment for stealing a female neighbour's underwear. They moved back to Liverpool when their father was released. John's bloodline and ancestry were known as the Laughing Magicians, legendary mages who have the power over synchronicity and were infamous for bluffing and tricking gods. This ancestry later drives John Constantine to partake in his lineage and practice magic. One of John's first acts of magic, as a child, was to hide all of his childhood innocence and vulnerability in a box to rid himself of it. Later, in the 1960s, a teenage John ran away from home, but not before a botched curse caused his father to become withered and frail. John eventually made his permanent home in London in 1969, rooming with Francis \"Chas\" Chandler, a young man who has since gone on to become John's closest—and longest surviving—friend.\n\nDuring the 1970s, John became involved in occult circles in London. He travelled other countries and visited San Francisco, where he met, and subsequently began a relationship with, the female magician Zatanna Zatara (in DC's The New 52, however, the two met in New York). He also became enamoured of punk rock; after seeing the Sex Pistols at the Roxy Club in London in 1977, John cut his long hair, called himself Johnny Con-Job, and formed his own band, Mucous Membrane, whose members included Chandler (as a roadie), a drummer named Beano and fellow Liverpudlian Gary Lester. They later released an album called \"Venus of the Hardsell\". John also performed as a famous stage magician in the 1980s, where he became famous for predicting the assassination attempt on U.S. President Ronald Reagan.\n\nJohn's first venture into occult \"heroism\" was a disaster. On tour with Mucous Membrane at the Casanova Club in Newcastle, he found the aftermath of a magical orgy gone horribly wrong: an abused child, Astra Logue, had conjured a hideous monster that took revenge on her father, the club's debauched owner, and the other adults who were tormenting her, and the monster refused to leave. With typical recklessness, John convinced some members of the band, along with several occultist friends, to try destroying the creature by summoning a demon of their own. Unfortunately, this demon was not under their control and after it had destroyed the child's monster, it tormented Constantine's friends and took the child to Hell. John had summoned the demon by one of its names, but not its true name - Nergal - which would have been required to bind and control the demon. Nergal would go on to be a regular antagonist throughout the series. John suffered a nervous breakdown after this incident, and was committed to Ravenscar Psychiatric Hospital, which he drifted in and out of over the years.\n\nThe guilt of Astra hung over him for many years until, in his mid-forties, he used some magic and con-artistry to free not only her, but also the souls of all the other children trapped in Hell. As for the rest of the \"Newcastle Crew\", the incident left the group both physically and psychologically scarred. After helping Dream retrieve his sands, Dream in turn relieves Constantine of the nightmares that had plagued him since the incident.\n\nJohn is later freed from Ravenscar by London gangsters, threatening to torture and kill his sister and her family unless he helps to resurrect a mob boss's dead son. Knowing that resurrection is impossible even by magical means, John instead summons a demon to take the boy's place; a desperate act that has bloody consequences many years later. Years later, John was able to reconvene the surviving members of the \"Newcastle Crew\" to help with his investigation of the Brujería cult, as seen in \"Swamp Thing\" Nos. 37–49. The cult murdered most of them, including John's then-lover, Emma. These people, and others who have died due to John's carelessness, have continued to appear to him as silent, reproachful ghosts. Chas is the most prominent one of very few human friends to have survived a long-term association with John.\n\nJohn first met Swamp Thing in 1985 after being interested in the creature. John later acts as the Swamp Thing's protector, guide, and voice of omen, even teaching the Thing to amplify his powers. Both would have further adventure with each other, such as John introducing the Thing to the Parliament of Trees, Thing using John's body to make love to his wife and father a child named Tefe, and fighting off the Damnation Army from summoning the Anti-Christ. Both carry a dull, but nevertheless fruitful friendship with each other. Constantine even invites Swamp Thing to his 40th birthday and assures the Thing he'll try not to bother him again. In 1991 while in his late thirties, John contracted terminal lung cancer. During this time, he sought the help of a dying friend, Brendan, who had sold his soul to the First of the Fallen, the most powerful lord of Hell. When the First came to collect the soul, John tricked him into drinking holy water, which rendered him helpless and prevented him from collecting the friend's soul at the appointed time.\n\nFor this, the First promised to make John suffer unprecedented torment in Hell when he dies. Slowly dying from cancer, John hatched a plan to save himself from eternal torment. He secretly sold his soul to the other two Lords of Hell. When they discovered Constantine's actions they realized that they could not allow him to die, or else they would be forced to go to all-out war over his soul, a war whose only winner would be \"the Lord of the Hosts,\" i.e., God and his angels. They were also far too stubborn and proud, however, to enter anything resembling an alliance. As a result, they were forced to cure John of his cancer. This led to the First plotting a grand revenge on Constantine, who manipulated the demon via his ally Ellie, a succubus, into coming into a trap; the plan only barely succeeded, and while the First was temporarily defeated many of John's friends were killed.\n\nConstantine then went on to have a series of adventures and misadventures playing the role of puppet and puppeteer with his signature style and profane sarcasm. He managed to free Astra and every other child in Hell, but at the cost of the First returning to power; also, as part of the scheme, John's worst attributes were given separate existence as \"Demon Constantine\" which meant he himself could not go to Hell. As part of an attempt to regain his nastier edge, he used Ellie, and this led to her taking out a revenge scheme in 1998 that forced him to turn to the First for help; Ellie ended up in Hell and several of John's oldest friends left him. John, being tired of all this, contacted God. God appears and the two converse in a campfire. John then tells him his reason for contacting Him. He warns God that if his soul is ever sent to Hell, he would easily take over, and do nasty things such as unleashing the demons and locking away Hell so that the damned cannot enter and have no resting place. John blackmails God to do his bidding, and that's to keep his soul away from Hell. God, knowing of John's abilities, does so. But warns him of what will come next.\n\nOn return to Britain in 2003 and after reconciling with his sister (who believed he was dead), he went on to be involved in a magic war in London and was horrified to find his niece Gemma, whom he'd wanted to keep out of this life, had become a witch. He soon ended up organising a counterstrike against a creature known as the Shadow Dog, having been warned of its coming and believing it was an entity that brought death and madness; instead, it was a guardian against the true enemy, the Beast, who was manipulating John into giving it free access to humanity. In the process, he was rendered an amnesiac, leaving him vulnerable to the schemes of the demon Rosacarnis. To get his memories back, he had to spend a day in her service, in which she had him father three demonic children, who went on to massacre anyone who knew Constantine, from friends to enemies to people who'd only briefly met him. Among them was his sister Cheryl; one of his sons had exploited her husband's religious fanaticism to make him see his wife as a witch — and thus a person to be killed. This forced Constantine to go on journey to Hell in the hopes to return his sister's soul. Accompanying him was Nergal, the demon he thought he had killed by sending him to the border of Heaven.\n\nWhile in Hell, John and Nergal met the demon Constantine, who tried to kill the original one. John was forced to let Nergal enter his body in order to finish him. Later they also encountered Ellie, who seemed to have quite pardoned John for him selling her out to the First. She was not subject to any torture or punishment, either. The couple finally arrived at Rosacarnis' hall, where there was a feast with all three of Constantine's children, the First, and many demons from all Hell. Because of Nergal's earlier possession of his body, any damage done to John would be mirrored on Nergal. Nergal, however, calls the bluff, showing that the effect goes both ways by clawing at his chest slightly. John begs Rosacarnis to kill him to save his sister, but just as she's about to, the First of the Fallen intervenes and immediately kills Rosacarnis, since Constantine's soul is his by \"right of insult\" and will only be taken when he deems fit. The First also kills Rosacarnis' two sons, but spares the daughter, who had been dealing with issues of identity and had doubts about whether she wanted to continue to exist.\n\nFollowing this, the First commands Nergal to release the soul he's holding. Cheryl's soul is pure and innocent and does not belong in Hell, but the First offers her a truly devilish deal. Informing her that her husband, Constantine's brother-in-law Tony, has killed himself with her blood still staining his hands, thus making him twice damned, and offering to fairly divide her husband's punishment between the two of them if she stays of her own free will. Constantine attempts in vain to argue that Tony murdered her and does not deserve that mercy. Despite all that has happened, Cheryl still loves her husband enough to accept the First's deal and decides to stay. Constantine can do nothing as the First gloats over his victory and then sends him back home. Unable to look at his niece Gemma's tear-filled eyes because of his failure, Constantine runs barefoot down the stairs and into the Liverpool night.\n\nJohn later revisits Ravenscar Asylum, the place where he was thrown after being framed for Astra's murder. John remembers all the maltreatment he suffered, and remembers every suffering and guilt he had for the past years. At first it appears as though it is too much for him and that he will be overtaken by the images of the ones he has hurt, but the being turns into the form of a baby. This baby, who is the sum of all his guilt and self-hatred, is then promptly thrown off a cliff near the asylum and into the sea. After killing the creature, Constantine is now free, and becomes even a bit more cocky and picks back up his earlier style from the beginning of his book and his appearances from Swamp Thing: a double-breasted blue suit underneath his trench coat, and slicked-back gelled hair.\n\nLater on, a Sudanese shaman who had first bound the hunger demon Mnemoth has been having dreams of Constantine and a war-mage named Mako who is coming to kill him and devour his being. The reason that Constantine is a specific target of the war-mage is because he is \"The Laughing Magician\" who is also known as \"The Constant One.\" Mako wants to devour him so he can absorb that power and have his being made a fixture of the universe. To counter this attack to come, the African magus puts a dream of his into a tree root, with Constantine's true nature in those dreams. After doing this a young man is sent as a messenger to find John and deliver the message. Constantine later notices that something is wrong on the synchronicity lines and it seems that he is going head first against the traffic. Remembering that Mako mentioned Ravenscar when he found out about Constantine, he tries to summon his unborn brother, but instead is summoned to his brother. The soul of Constantine's brother tells John that he was not to be born and that it should have been he who had been born instead, as he is the Laughing Magician, he requests that he and John merge their souls so that they become one and can fix the world, they had previously attempted this but John was apparently too strong willed. John then makes the link that it was the soul of his unborn brother that caused him to get cancer and for his relationships to fail, and that anytime he tried to take control of his life, something bad would happen to make John weaker, so that the souls might be able to merge. After realizing this, John cuts the soul of his brother out of his own soul, so that he can control his life and live his way.\n\nIn the 2010s, John entangles himself in further adventures. He goes to India and fights a ghost of a British soldier of the Sepoy rebellion, fights a Babylonian shape shifter named Julian, gets his thumb cut off to contact , marrying a young girl named Epiphany Greaves who was also the daughter of an infamous gangster, looking for his lost trench coat that his niece sold, finding his sister's long lost son named Finn, and finally getting his sister's soul from Hell.\n\nBy 2013, John was contacted by the Three Fates, who tell him that he will finally die in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, John happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the 5th day came, John Constantine was murdered in his own home when he was ambushed and killed by a gangster. His funeral was attended by many of his friends and family. But it later turns out that he had faked his death yet again. Constantine decides he should keep a low profile, because he doesn't want to hurt the people around him again. He bids farewell with Finn and Epiphany, and finally visits Gemma. In the meanwhile, Gemma, hearing about her uncle's return from the Fates, tries to kill herself with a poisonous revolver, but Constantine sneaks the last remaining dart from his niece. Gemma says her life will be better without him, because he takes up too much of it and she is either hating him or loving him too much. John suggests he leave her be, but Gemma fears he will return and put her life to misery. John tells Gemma to make her own decision, and she reluctantly points the revolver at him. Gemma closes her eyes before muttering, \"Damn you, John Constantine.\" and pulls the trigger, but when she opened her eyes again, Constantine had vanished. The last scene shows Constantine in the Long Journey's End bar, holding a glass of liquor with a vacant look.\n\nIn The New 52, Constantine appears as one of the lead characters in \"Justice League Dark\". His history is slightly altered, such as meeting Zatanna in New York instead of San Francisco, and the origins of how he got his trademark trench coat. During the gap where he travels the world to learn magic, the New 52 added the history of him meeting Nick Necro, who was implied to be John's mentor and original owner of the trench coat. The \"\" storyline would establish that the three characters were all involved in a magical pact and a love triangle, which fell apart due to Zatanna ending her relationship with Nick to pursue John. Nick states \"We were all in love, and you two shut me out!\" The character also stars in the ongoing series \"Constantine\", which replaces \"Hellblazer\".\nHe is still an unsavory trickster in the New 52 universe, as, while during the Trinity War between the three Justice Leagues, he tries to trick Shazam (15-year-old Billy Batson) so that he can steal his magic. He fails, causing Billy to become even more distrustful of other people than he already was.\n\nIn \"Constantine\" #14, it was revealed that John Constantine, as a boy, was taught and cast his first magical spell—at the cost of the lives of his parents and his house burning down (it was implied that his mother, unlike in Hellblazer, survived the childbirth). It was also revealed that he spent his childhood in the '80s in Liverpool, England (it is not shown if he had any sibling, like Cheryl Constantine in Hellblazer). The one who taught John his first spell was Tannarak from the Cult of the Cold Flame (\"Constantine\" #15).\n\nHis primary enemies in \"Constantine\" are Mister E, Sargon the Sorceress (the original Sargon's daughter), and Tannarak: all are members of the Cult of the Cold Flame. Together with his allies Papa Midnite, the psychic mage Spellbinder, and a witch called Julia Everheart, Constantine attempts to destroy the Cult by conspiring a scam to take Sargon and Tannarak by surprise. However, prior to the planned battle, Constantine is thrown into the battlefield in Dar es Salaam in World War I because of a ritual going wrong, making his plan ultimately fail. An encounter with Doctor Occult there results in Constantine being transported to Earth-2 - a world dying under siege from Darkseid and his army of Parademons.\n\nIn Earth-2, he is assaulted by the Parademons, but Wotan comes and rescues him, before trapping him to open a gateway to escape the dying Earth. Constantine manages to convince Wotan to spare his life, then works with the ancient sorcerer to open a door through his body to Earth-0. As Wotan enters the doorway, he is split into two halves, because there are two John Constantines in this world: the original Constantine and the native one of Earth-2, who is surrounded by his friends and even gets married. After the death of Wotan, Constantine resolves to find his Earth-2 counterpart. He travels to Liverpool and witnesses all the horror and despair of the dying world. As soon as John reached the destination, he is shocked to find his \"parents\" (actually the Earth-2 John's parents), his friends Gary Lester, Chas Chandler and his former love interest Maureen still alive.\n\nThe Earth-2 John quickly attacks him by grabbing him in the neck, but they are engulfed in visions of their lives in parallel right after: a dangerous life marred with sorcery, adventures and regrets of Earth-0 John and a much quieter, much happier life of Earth-2 John. Constantine quickly earns the trust of the Earth-2 family, who consider him to be a wonder. Together, they escape to a warehouse where John instructs them to draw sigils to cast a complex spell. As John is lecturing about the unpredictability and the price of magic, Doctor Fate appears in front of his eyes, claims to have foreseen his arrival and offers to help him.\n\nDoctor Fate reminds John of an incoming horde of Parademons and tells him to quickly cast the spell to escape from the dying world, himself hoping to flee with John and the family too. John discovers that the spell requires one Constantine dies: either himself or the Earth-2 John. As the Parademons storm in and take each family member down one by one, John is torn over between saving his own life and let the good, honest Earth-2 John live by sacrificing himself. Finally, he chooses to save his own skin: as he is kissing the other John, he holds his hand and drives the knife into his heart, ultimately kills the \"other John\". As the spells start working, John casts an additional spell to trick Doctor Fate, which masks his presence from the ancient sorcerer, then departs, brings along the family members and many other people.\n\nBy killing the \"proper\" Constantine, he earns the wrath and hatred of the Earth-2 family. Being called \"Devil\", John corrects the family when they reach Heaven while peeling through the layers of the dying world: Heaven itself, also under assault from Darkseid's force, has closed its door and started departing, deems this world beyond salvation. Later, John and his entourage are attacked by Doctor Fate, who manages to detect Constantine's whereabout. Despite succeeding in countering the assault, John loses his \"mother\" Mary-Anne, who is dragged back by Fate's chain. This greatly traumatizes Thomas Constantine, John's father, who even attempts to commit suicide, but is talked out of it by John.\n\nAfter a long and hard trip, Constantine finally makes it back home, but Darkseid has sensed him and is in hot pursuit. As the menacing hand of the Apokolips God is reaching to him, Constantine enacts his \"last trick\": by sacrificing some souls of his entourage, John manages to get enough power to cast the \"Ring of Dolus\" spell, which uses every happy memories, every pleasant thought, every piece of hope in John Constantine to swirl a magical \"web\" made of lies. This powerful spell helps John projecting an illusion of an already dead universe to fool Darkseid, while John manages to bring himself, the family and the Earth-2 civilians to safety - he even \"pickpockets\" some survivors back from Darkseid's clutch.\n\nAs Constantine lands in the Jurassic Coast, England, he is confronted by Thomas, who points a gun at his head. Tired of everything, John yells at his father, begs him to kill him off for good. Unable to do it, Thomas drops his gun, but Maureen quickly puts it up and prepares to shoot John while questioning his actions. John contemplates and sees that he is no hero, but he is the only one willing to sacrifice \"proper John\" to save his family, or trade a hundred people for the safety of six billion. He magically teleports away, leaves the family and the survivors behind. Later, John goes back to New York and visits his old friend Lloyd at his bar to tell him about his latest adventures.\n\nThe New 52 \"Constantine\" series ends at issue #23 and was relaunched as \"Constantine: The Hellblazer\" written by Ming Doyle and James Tynion IV in June 2015.\n\nThe \"Constantine\" tie-in tells the story of John Constantine five years into a possible future of the New 52 universe. He somehow obtains the ultimate occult artifact, the Helmet of Fate, and manages to trick and kill the ancient magician Nabu with the help of an old ifrit.\n\nJohn Constantine's origin in the New 52 universe is seemingly retconned in the Secret Origins series. In the story, a group of kids in Liverpool manages to get their hands on an occult book and uses it to summon a magical creature called \"Legendbreaker\" to discover Constantine's true origin. Instead, the creature tells three conflicting stories: one featuring John's mother dead in childbirth, leaving him to his abusive father; another have John Constantine being born in a loving family with proud and doting parents; the last one is a John born in an unremarkable family, but his older sister is mad and (probably) possessed by a dark force. They all lead to the death of his entire family and set the path for John Constantine into the world of magic, to the fateful incident in Newcastle, albeit the actions and consequences are different. The creature tries to claim the souls of the young \"mystics\", but the real John Constantine shows up and chases it away. He tells the kids to go back home, forget what has just happened, and his true origins will forever remain unknown - but it does not matter.\n\nJohn Constantine stars in the DC You title \"Constantine: The Hellblazer\" written by Ming Doyle and James Tynion IV. The title introduces John in a new outfit and new hairstyle, in his own adventures, unrelated to superheroes business.\n\nConstantine uses magic to trick a cashier in a clothes store and gets himself a new suit. He pickpockets a passengers, uses the money to buy a meal in a small restaurant and gets acquainted to its owner Oliver, a single father of two daughters. As John is busy chatting and flirting with Oliver, an old \"friend\", the demon Blythe, pulls John away and convinces him to help them solve their problems in their latest business place, a soul farm. They want John to eliminate their business partner, which John completes, and he also cons Blythe to banish herself back to Hell. Suddenly, John sees his entire ghost entourage, and Gary Lester's ghost - who has tried to warn him since the beginning - tells him that Frank North's spirit had vanished completely, and something had been after John's ghosts. John tries to set up a scheme to lure and trap the entity which had been after his ghosts, by ramping up quite a number of ghosts from 'haunted sites'. The plan fails and Gary Lester's ghost is also taken by the being. After a few flashbacks and meeting with an old acquaintance named Georgie, John begins to unravel the true identity of the ghost-hunting entity, as his (and Georgie's) old time lover, Veronica. After releasing Veronica's soul, Constantine starts to notice (and is also warned by other beings whom he deems as 'friends') the increasing number of supernatural activities in New York city. Being part of Neron's grand scheme, John manages to con (after quite a bit of struggle) Neron into thinking the souls he had claim to be worthless, and leaves New York city for good. Albeit the cost of Oliver's soul which Blythe had claimed by previously blackmailing the latter and John with the souls of his daughters.\n\nIn \"The Hellblazer: Rebirth\", John gets back to London to remove the curse placed upon him (originally shown in \"Constantine\" #3, which makes him physically sick whenever he sets foot on London soil) and resumes his adventures in the new DC rebirth-initiative \"The Hellblazer\". The series restores many of the traditional aspects of the original \"Hellblazer\" run while still remaining firmly in the larger DC Universe, restoring his original backstory and featuring old allies such as Chas, Mercury and Swamp Thing.\n\nJohn Constantine returns to England and is greeted by his old time friend, Chas Chandler, at the airport. He resolves to dispel the curse, set on him by a demon called \"Laughing Boy\" whom he once crossed in the past, by using a ritual that deflect the curse from him to 8 million souls in London. Shazam and Wonder Woman make an appearance - they notice the ravens in London dying and prepare to intervene, while Swamp Thing appears before them and tells them that they should trust Constantine on this one. The \"Laughing Boy\" demon tells John that he will return Astra's soul if John agrees to cancel his spell. However, it turns out that John is buying time for the psychic Mercury, who is now a young woman, to arrive and tell him the real name of \"Laughing Boy\" (Nybbas). John takes control of the demon, cancels the curse and London returns to normal.\n\nIn the past, the djinn have tried to hide away the secret of their existence from human. One djinn, named Marid, was stopped by his brother when he tried to prevent the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which triggered World War I. In South London, present day, John Constantine is staying in Chas's house when he is contacted by Swamp Thing. Abigail Arcane, the Avatar of the Rot and Swamp Thing's lover, is missing. John enlists Mercury's help, who is eager to help Swamp Thing despite disliking John. Meanwhile, in Paris, Marid resurfaces and attacks his brother.\n\nJohn tells Chas which horse to bet on and makes the cabbie drive him to the Tate Club. Clarice Sackville offers him a deal with \"someone\", but John flatly refuses. That \"someone\" turns out to be Marid, who is shown working with Clarice and Constantine seems to be an obstacle. John is tracked down by two djinns but manages to escape to the London Underground. He meets Map, who behaves oddly and warns John of an upcoming danger in town: the djinn, and that Clarice actually wants John to stop the djinn from finding Swamp Thing. John returns home only to find Chas being tied and gagged by a gang of white supremacists, who manage to deduce Chas's winning bet was due to John, and force the con man to tell them how to win bets. While John is \"doing magick\", Marid and his djinns arrive and kill off the gang. John and Chas manage to escape.\n\nMercury and Swamp Thing travel in the Rot to find Abigail Arcane. Mercury jumps into a \"wormhole\" while Swamp Thing stays behind and battles the forces of the Rot. Mercury returns and rescues Swamp Thing. When asked what she found, Constantine arrives and answer \"djinn\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hellblazer\" boosted the popularity and image of the occult detective fiction genre and shaped it to its modern form. Many modern examples of the genre such as \"Hellboy\", \"Supernatural\", \"Grimm\", \"The Originals\", and \"The Dresden Files\" have been influenced by the character. Many imitators of both the series and its character flourished such as \"Criminal Macabre\", \"Gravel\", \"Planetary\", and others. Its elements and style have been used countless of times in other works and many analogues of the cynical John Constantine have appeared.\n\nUnlike most comic book magicians, Constantine rarely uses magical spells, unless he has to, especially in combat. Constantine faces most of his challenges relying primarily on his cunning, quick-thinking during fights, vast knowledge of the occult, manipulation of opponents and allies, and an extensive list of contacts. These skills are often more useful than his magical ones. He is known to have deceived many of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe, such as The First of the Fallen and The Presence, as well as manipulating Batman and Superman. He is considered by many as being the world's greatest con man. Constantine is one of a few people knowing all the routes to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife, which he uses to escape and teleport without the danger of being chased by enemies. In the graphic novel \"\", he once allowed himself to be killed, but later resurrects himself by exiting the afterlife.\n\nAs a sorcerer, Constantine is armed with the knowledge of many magical spells, rituals, and curses, such as evocation, necromancy, illusions, invisibility, and can even use magic to time travel. He has a wide range of protection magic such as sigils and magic circles that can protect him from both physical and supernatural attacks. John's most signature ability is synchronicity wave travelling, which is an instinctual supernatural ability for Constantine to make his own luck. This has led John to uncanny luck at games of chance, the ability to avoid and escape harm, meet the right kind of ally to help prevent or stop an apocalyptic event from happening, and reshape the battle he's fighting to his own accord. Constantine is highly resistant to many psychic attacks such as telepathy, possessions, and mind control. He can even use magic to block off omnipresence, seen where he once used sigils to hide himself from the First of the Fallen. By the New 52, other magical powers such as teleportation, counter spells, elemental magic, telekinesis, and immobilisation have been added. He can use magic to reflect damages done to him onto his enemies.\n\nAside from sorcery, Constantine has exhibited considerable mastery in \"stage magic skills\"—hypnosis, sleight of hand, pick pocketing and escapology. John carries with him an arsenal of powerful magical artifacts to aid him in battle, such as The House of Mystery, which also serves as his transport to different realms of the universe, and his trademark trench coat that possesses powerful demonic powers. Ever since tricking the Lords of Hell into curing his lung cancer, he was perpetually in good health and physicality. Constantine's blood is demonically tainted, initially by a blood transfusion from the demon Nergal, and later by sex with a succubus. His blood has been shown to have healing properties, and is noted to have an age-managing effect. It also acted as a defence mechanism when attacked by the King of the Vampires, as it is highly corrosive and poisonous. Constantine's skill at unarmed combat varies depending on the writer. Some portray him as a poor physical fighter, others as a capable hand-to-hand combatant. Over time he has won occasional fights using magical weapons, by fighting dirty, or by quick-thinking.\n\nConstantine sold his soul to two lords of Hell, Beelzebub and Azazel, both of whom accepted the deal. This was a trick to make sure that neither they nor Satan himself, who also had a claim, could take possession of his soul without destroying hell and its denizens. Thus until Satan quit and Azazel was sealed away by Dream of the Endless he was protected by the three like guardian angels.\n\nAlan Moore claims to have met his creation on two occasions. In 1993, he told \"Wizard\" magazine:\n\nHis second meeting with his creation was illustrated in 2001's \"Snakes and Ladders\", an adaptation by Eddie Campbell of one of Moore's performance art pieces:\n\nThey met a third time in fiction, when Moore was written into issue No. 120 of \"Hellblazer\" by then-author Paul Jenkins. Moore is seen sitting in silhouette at the back of a bar as John Constantine (who is on a pub crawl with the reader) raises a drink to him.\n\nWriters who had their run on the \"Hellblazer\" series have also admitted meeting the character in real life. Original \"Hellblazer\" writer Jamie Delano also claims to have encountered Constantine, during his run on the character, outside the British Museum. Peter Milligan saw Constantine at a party around 2009 and rushed after him, only to find he'd disappeared. Brian Azzarello once saw him in a Chicago bar but avoided him, saying that \"the thing about John is, the last thing you'd want to be is his friend.\"\n\nThe character won the 1986 \"Favourite Supporting Character\" by Eagle Award, followed by winning it again in the same category a year later. In addition to being ranked third in \"Empire\" magazine's 50 Greatest Comic Characters and being ranked No. 10 in \"Wizard Magazine's\" Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time, he is also listed in IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes as No. 29, stating that \"John Constantine is pretty low on the totem pole as far as DC's magical players go. But through a combination of guile, trickery, and plain old ornery charm, Constantine battles the worst Hell has to offer and lives to tell the tale. Constantine is a byproduct of both the punk rock era and Margaret Thatcher's Britain. He isn't very nice, he drinks and smokes like they're both going out of style, and his friends always seem to pay for his own magical misdeeds. And yet we can't help but love this crusty old magician all the same.\" \"WatchMojo.com\" listed Constantine in its Top 10 Comic Book Anti-Heroes. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Constantine as #30 on their list of the \"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\".\n\nThe character also garnered some negative reception, where UGO.com listed both Constantine and Zatanna in UGO's the Dirtiest Comic Book Sex Scenes, where they comment that, \"One DC heroine who often finds herself unlucky in love is the backwards magician Zatanna, who can never seem to find a quality dude. One of the most fulfilling relationships she's had to date is with that reprobate John Constantine, who is the very definition of a \"love 'em and leave 'em\" kind of dude. The pair hooked up a number of times but their respective worldviews were just too different, plus he's straight Vertigo and she's wiping minds in the Justice League. The commute would be hideous.\" During Brian Azzarello's run on the series, the Ashes & Dust in the City of Angels story arc gained controversy for portraying Constantine in a bisexual relationship, though it wouldn't be the last time Constantine's bisexuality was explored.\n\nFandomania.com ranked the film \"Constantine\" in No. 13 of their Ultimate 20 Comic Book Film Adaptations, stating that Keanu Reeves's performance \"was good\", although saying it might have been better if \"played by the person the character was originally modelled after: Sting of the Police.\" \"TopTenz.net\" ranked him No. 5 in Top 10 Comic Book Anti-Heroes, saying that \"Just knowing John Constantine is likely to get you killed: during his comic's run just about every member of his supporting cast has either been killed, maimed, mutilated, tortured and coerced into making deals with fiends from the Pit. And yet Constantine goes on, a supernatural warrior willing to pay almost any price to keep the darkest evil at bay. In recent times Constantine has got rid of the guilt and self-loathing plaguing him by magically giving it the physical form of a baby and throwing it off a cliff. What a magnificent bastard...\"\n\nSonia Harris from \"Comics Should Be Good\" praised \"Hellblazer\", saying that \"watching John delve into his past in order to exorcise his (and the worlds) literal and metaphorical demons is a delight. Simon Bisley does an incredible job of visually contrasting the pretty young version of Constantine with the imposing man he has become. Time and misadventure have scarred and hardened John, and the man he has become has the strength and will to transform his environment by channelling the anger that pained him so much as a young, fresh-faced, suicidal punk kid.\"\nConstantine ranked 30th on ComicsAlliance's 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics list that even though almost all of his relationships end badly, they can't warn others against his wily charms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe song \"Stranger in the Mirror\" by Ookla the Mok is written from Constantine's point of view, including a lyrical reference to 'the Newcastle incident'.\n\n\nThe noir fiction author John Shirley is credited with writing three \"Hellblazer\" novels, including the novelization of the Constantine film. The novel \"Hellblazer: War Lord\" features Constantine talking about \"another John Constantine in an alternate universe, [who] has black hair and lives most of his life in Los Angeles\" whilst giving a brief summary of the film's plot.\n\nDC Direct created a toyline of John which is more related to his comic book appearance. Another action figure toy line was created by DC Heroclix, which resembles the Constantine in The New 52. Film tie-in merchandise of the film were also released.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52252501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52252501", "title": "Joseph Heleluhe", "text": "Joseph Heleluhe\n\nJoseph Hewahewa Kaimihakulani Heleluhe (June 2, 1855 – July 8, 1900) was a member of the Hawaiian nobility who served as a retainer and private secretary of Queen Liliʻuokalani, the last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and accompanied her on her trips to the United States and Washington, DC from 1896 to 1900 to prevent the American annexation of Hawaii.\n\nHe was born in June 2, 1855, on the island of Hawaiʻi. English language newspapers claimed he was a native of Kaʻū while the \"Ke Aloha Aina\", a Hawaiian language newspaper, claimed he was born in Kapoho, Puna. His parents were Heleluhe and Kanoa. He had four known sisters: Keoki, Kaioewa, Kanoa, and Ana. From his mother Kanoa, he descended from Alapaʻinui and his son Keaweʻōpala, the kings of the island of Hawaiʻi prior to the accession of Kalaniʻōpuʻu. His father was possibly the same individual as J. H. Heleluhe, who served in the legislature of the kingdom as a member of the House of Representatives for the district of Puna during the legislative assembly of 1855, 1862, 1864, 1866 and 1867.\n\nHe attended the local schools in the Puna district and later studied at the Hilo Boarding School under American missionary David Belden Lyman. After finishing his education, he did physical labor in the district of Kaʻū for a time before going to Honolulu to serve King Kalākaua.\n\nAfter coming to Honolulu, Heleluhe worked as a retainer for the royal family. He served King Kalākaua as an under-secretary. He also worked as a steward for Kalākaua's sister and successor Liliʻuokalani, and accompanied her to the leper settlement at Kalaupapa on Molokai in 1891. He steadily rose in rank until he was appointed her private secretary in 1896. In 1892. Heleluhe was nominated as a National Reform Party candidate for the House of Representatives for Oʻahu's first ward. He lost this election. After the overthrow of the monarchy in 1893, Heleluhe and his wife Wakeke Ululani remained loyal to the royalist cause and supported the deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani. Following the outbreak of the unsuccessful 1895 Counter-Revolution, Heleluhe was arrested, held as a political prisoner, and temporarily imprisoned by forces loyal to the Republic of Hawaii in order for him to \"disclose the queen's treachery.\" Queen Liliʻuokalani, who was also imprisoned in the former ʻIolani Palace, described the ordeal Heleluhe had to endure in her 1898 memoir \"Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen\":\n\nMr. Heleluhe was taken by the government officers, stripped of all clothing, placed in a dark cell without light, food, air, or water, and was kept there for hours in hopes that the discomfort of his position would induce him to disclose something of my affairs. After this was found to be fruitless, he was imprisoned for about six weeks; when, finding their efforts in vain, his tormentors released him. No charge was ever brought against him in any way, which is true of about two hundred persons who were similarly confined.\n\nBetween 1896 and 1900, Heleluhe accompanied Queen Liliʻuokalani on her many trips abroad to the United States and Washington, DC to campaign against the American annexation of Hawaii and then assisted her in her attempts to reclaim the crown land after 1898. Initially, Elizabeth Kia Nahaolelua was chosen to be her lady-in-waiting but after the trips were extended, Heleluhe's wife Wakeke replaced her in the royal party as lady-in-waiting to the queen. From 1897 to 1898, Heleluke was also actively involved in rallying Hawaiians in signing the Kūʻē Petitions and petitioning against annexation. In 1897, he wrote to US President William McKinley and Secretary of State John Sherman with the petitions collected by Hui Aloha ʻĀina (Hawaiian Patriotic League) and Hui Kālaiʻāina.\n\nFollowing Liliʻuokalani's return to Hawaii in 1900, the 45-year-old Heleluhe succumbed to tuberculosis, on July 8, 1900. When it became evident his death was near, his final request was to die at Washington Place. Although he expired before arrival at the queen's residence, his funeral was held there. He was buried at the Kawaiahaʻo Church cemetery.\n\nHeleluhe married Wakeke Ululani Heleluhe, from Maui, who served as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Liliʻuokalani. They had two children: Jack Heleluhe and Myra Kailipanio Heleluhe Iona. Jack, also known as \"Prince Jack Heleluhe\", worked as a musician and member of the Royal Hawaiian Band; he became one of the first musicians to play Hawaiian music in the United States and was featured on N. B. Bailey's 1914 book \"A Practical Method for Self Instruction on the Ukulele and Banjo Ukulele\". Myra became a protège of the queen at a young age and later served as an associate of Princess Elizabeth Kahanu Kalanianaʻole and Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole.\n\nIn 1906, Wakeke lost favor with the queen after an attempt to discredit Lydia Kaʻonohiponiponiokalani Aholo, the queen's \"hānai\" daughter, backfired, and she was evicted from the houses she occupied at Washington Place and the queen's residence in Waikiki by the queen and her financial agent Joseph O. Carter. The reasons given for the queen's anger was Wakeke's \"disloyalty to me and dishonesty\"; she had lied to Aholo that the queen never wished to see her again. She may have later reconciled with the queen because Wakeke and Onalaa were listed as two of her old retainers at the deathbed of the queen. She, her daughter Myra and Lahilahi Webb stood vigil by Liliʻuokalani's casket while her body laid in the Royal Mausoleum prior to her final interment in the vault of the Kalākaua Crypt.\nWakeke died at her Honolulu home, on November 21, 1921.\n\n"}

He was killed during the Expedition of Al Raji.\n\nIn 625 some men requested that Muhammad send instructors to teach them Islam, but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah who wanted revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan by Muhammad's followers and they killed the Muslims. After killing Asim ibn Thabit, Hudhayl wanted to sell his head.\n\nAccording to William Montgomery Watt, the most common version of the event states that the motives of the Banu Lahyan for attacking Muslims, was that the Banu Lahyan wanted to get revenge for the assassination of their chief at Muhammad's instigation. So they bribed the two tribes of Khuzaymah to say they wanted to convert to Islam. Watt also said that the seven men Muhammad sent may have been spies for Muhammad and instructors for Arab tribes. He also said that the it is difficult to verify the exact date the assassination of their chief took place.\n\nAccording to the Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri, the Quraysh ordered Khubyab bin Adi to be crucified by Uqba bin al-Harith because he had killed Uqba bin al-Harith's father.\n\nMuhammad ordered The Mission of Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri to assassinate Abu Sufyan to avenge Khubyab bin Adi.\n\nKhubaib ibn Adiy was taken captive and escorted in a procession of thousands which was led by men like Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, and Safwan ibn Umayah, and which included Said ibn Amir.\n\nThe women and children pushed him to the place set for his death. Khubaib's death was to be in revenge for Quraysh losses in the battle of Badr. When the assembled throng arrived at the appointed place with him, the prisoner, Khubaib said in a firm but quiet voice amid the shouting of women and children:\n\nThis the Quraysh allowed. Khubaib faced the Ka'bah and prayed two rakaats. Then Khubaib faced the Quraysh leaders.\n\nThen the Meccans set about dismembering Khubayb's body while he was yet alive and taunting him in the process.\nWith his blood flowing, he replied, \"By God, I would not want to be safe and secure among my family while even a thorn hurts Muhammad.\"\nPeople shook their fists in the air and the shouting increased.\nKhubaib lifted his eyes to the heavens above the wooden cross.\nThereafter it could not be counted the number of swords and spears which cut through Khubaib's body.\n\n\n"}

Bissonnette was diagnosed with multiple other disorders including an intellectual disability and schizophrenia. Bissonnette's art is found at the Musée de l'Art Brut in Switzerland and multiple private collections.\n\nAt age two, Bissonnette suffered from a high fever, which might have caused some kind of damage to his nervous system. By the time he was eight, he was sent to the Brandon Training School, which was Vermont's only institute for the mentally handicapped at the time. During his 10-year confinement at Brandon, he was diagnosed as autistic, schizophrenic, mentally retarded and clinically insane.\n\nDuring this time, he used concepts of art such as drawing and painting to help himself through self-expression. To him, it's a form of therapy as he was non-verbal since the age of three or four. By the time he was 18, he was then transferred to Vermont Psychiatric Hospital in Waterbury, Vermont, but was soon released by his sister, Sally, who learned about how Larry was physically abused at the institutes, and even receive scars. Bissonnette was then enrolled with an residential program for the developmentally disabled.\n\nIn 1991, Larry began communicating for the first time after more than 30 years by typing with an assistive device. Apart from his art, this was another option to express his feelings and thoughts. Throughout his years wandering around in public, Larry displayed a threatening appearance which led to some treating him like an outcast, according to Pascal Cheng who is Larry's aid. But, Larry is aware of this after releasing his thoughts through typing.\n\nIn 1998, Larry began his journey as a public speaker at several National Educational Conferences in which he spoken about autism, communication, and art. Despite being nonverbal, Larry uses his assistive-device typing skills to describe what he wishes to say. He says he is aware that everyone viewed and treated him like an outcast which made everyone realize he is the same as everyone else.\n\nIn 2010, Larry and another autism-rights speaker, Tracy Thresher, described others treating them as outcasts, and revealed that they are actually capable despite others' beliefs. With assistive devices and encouraging others on the autism spectrum about what they can do, others can learn that they are not freaks, but can reach out not only with words, but with courage to work with others including those who are non-autistic. The two men traveled the world and visited several nations such as Japan and Finland.\n\nLarry's success in public speaking brought him to the attention of various media. In 2005, Larry starred in his biographical film, \"My Classic Life as an Artist: A Portrait of Larry Bissonnette\", which earned an award. In 2011, Larry and his ally, Tracy, was in a documentary called \"Wretches and Jabberers\", and in 2012, they were both featured in an episode of the National Geographic \"Taboo\" television series which was titled \"Strange Behavior\".\n"}

{"id": "2219489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2219489", "title": "Maria Nikiforova", "text": "Maria Nikiforova\n\nMaria Grigor'evna Nikiforova (; ; 1885–1919), was an anarchist partisan leader. A self-described terrorist from the age of 16, she was known widely by her nickname, Marusya. Through her exploits she became a renowned figure in the anarchist movement of 1918–1919 in Ukraine during Russian Civil War.\n\nBorn in Alexandrovsk (now Zaporizhia), Ukraine, in 1885, Maria's father was an officer and hero of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. At the age of 16, she left home and became a babysitter, sales clerk, and ultimately a factory worker, with a position of bottle washer in a vodka distillery. She joined a local group of anarcho-communists.\n\nShe adopted a strategy of \"motiveless terrorism\" (bezmotivny terror), staging a number of bombings and expropriation missions, including bank robberies. In 1907 she was captured, her involvement in these activities leading to a death sentence, later commuted to life imprisonment. She served part of her sentence in the Petropavlovsk prison in St. Petersburg, before being exiled to Siberia in 1910. From there she escaped to Japan. She went from there to the United States, then Spain, and finally arrived in Paris. By 1913 she had become well known by a nickname, Marusya, a Slavic diminutive form of \"Maria\", though when or how she acquired the name is not known.. She was very familiar with it, using it as a signature and was addressed by strangers with it. In Paris, she married Witold Brzostek, a Polish anarchist and friend, as a matter of convenience. With the outbreak of World War I, she sided with Peter Kropotkin's anti-German position, in favor of the Allied powers. She applied and graduated from a French officer college, serving in the Macedonian front.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Russian revolution, she abandoned France and returned to Petrograd. In the city, she organized and spoke at pro-anarchist rallies in Kronstadt. In the summer of 1917, with anti-anarchist activity within the Russian Provisional Government on the rise, Maria escaped back to her home town in Alexandrovsk, Ukraine. Once there, she organized a fighting force of anarchist Black Guards under her command to terrorize the city's authorities, in particular army officers and landlords who refused to cooperate with peasant efforts to redistribute wealth. Alexandrovsk's nationalist government struggled to maintain order under the subversive actions of leftists in general, and anarchists in particular, who exercised political control and popular support to exclude the influence of the Central Rada and redistribute private property.\n\nWhen the October Revolution took place in Russian Empire, leftist-dominated cities such as Huliaipole were already teetering on open civil war. There, anarchists gained strength by appealing to peasant enthusiasm for revolution. Upon the invasion of Ukraine by the Red Army, the soviet of the small city issued a decree calling for fighters to join the invasion to overthrow the Ukrainian nationalists. Hundreds of men, mostly anarchists, formed a Black Guard under Nestor Makhno and his brother Sava, and marched on Alexandrovsk. Under siege by advancing Red Army forces to the north, Makhno's anarchists to the east, and subversion by Nikiforova's Black Guards from within, the nationalist army retreated from the city on January 15, 1918. The city shortly came under Bolshevik control. Makhno's forces arrived within days, altering the balance of power in the anarchist's favor.\n\nWith Alexandendrovsk secured, Nikiforova and her new ally, Nestor Makhno, held a meeting with the Bolsheviks. Backed by their Black Guards, the duo negotiated to become anarchist representatives in the city's new Revolutionary committee. At the beginning, Maroussia and Makhno have allied her on common grounds of anarchism, and later Maroussia has begun to accuse Nestor of ignoring the anarchist ideas. \"She called him for a bloody struggle against the exploiters and Ukrainian nationalism\"\n\nNikiforova was appointed to the position of assistant deputy, but within weeks Makhno stepped down in dissatisfaction with the group's lack of radicalism. The pair would operate independently as military commanders in the future, but worked closely and often pooled resources in pursuing an anarchist revolution. Makhno historian, Michael Palij, noted that Nikiforova \"exercised a substantial influence upon Makhno from the very beginning of their acquaintance\".\n\nIn the summer of 1917, anarchists unofficially held economic power in Huliaipole, though this was due to underground activity, as officially power rested with the Bolshevik backed soviet in the city \nIn August 1917, Nikiforova seized and robbed a military storehouse at Orikhiv, subsequently attacking, disarming and dispersing the town's regiment and executing all officers captured. However, rather than pass these spoils to the Red Army, they were delivered to Makhno and his own Black Guards. This signaled the end of Nikiforova's loyalty to the committee and Bolsheviks, though she would continue to ally with the Red Army occasionally in battle.\n\nShe later established a new Black Guard detachment in the other cities, including Elisavetgrad.\n\nIn December 1917, her Black Guards helped to establish Soviet power in eastern Ukraine cities of Kharkiv and Yekaterinoslav, as well as Aleksandrovsk. In thanks, the Bolshevik commander in the region, Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, gave her funds to upgrade her detachment, which became known as the \"Free Combat Druzhina\". This unit was active in fighting the Whites Guards, the Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Germans-Austro-Hungarians over a large area of southern Ukraine. She was instrumental in establishing Soviet power in the city of Yelizavetgrad (today Kropyvnytskyi) and later was involved in bloody battles in quelling a right-wing revolt in the city. In April 1918, she received a commendation from Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko for her revolutionary activities.\n\nThe Free Combat Druzhina was equipped with two large guns and an armoured flatcar. The wagons were loaded with armoured cars, tachankas, and horses as well as troops which meant that the detachment was by no means restricted to railway lines. The trains were festooned with banners reading \"The Liberation of the Workers is the Affair of the Workers Themselves\", \"Long Live Anarchy\", \"Power Breeds Parasites\", and \"Anarchy is the Mother of Order.\"\n\nThe soldiers were better fed and equipped than many of the Red Army units. Although there were no official uniforms, the soldiers certainly had a sense of style. Long hair (not common in that era), sheepskin caps, officers' service jackets, red breeches, and ammunition belts were much in evidence. The Druzhina was composed of a core of militants devoted to Marusya and a larger group which came and went on a fairly casual basis. The militants included a fair number of Black Sea sailors, noted for their fighting qualities throughout Ukraine.\n\nWith their black flags and cannons, Marusya's echelons resembled pirate ships sailing across the Ukrainian steppe. One observer, the Left-SR I. Z. Steinberg, compared the trains to the Flying Dutchman, liable to appear at any time, anywhere. Travelling in echelons, the Druzhina advanced to meet the enemy, which in January 1918, meant the White Guards and the Ukrainian Central Rada.\n\nNikiforova was put on the trial twice by the Bolsheviks on charges of insubordination and pillaging: in Taganrog in April 1918 and in Moscow in January 1919. She was acquitted at the first trial, where witnesses were present to speak in her defense. Antonov-Ovseyenko also telegraphed a letter in support of her, commending her revolutionary activities in aid to the Bolsheviks. At the second, she was unable to launch a legal defense, and was banned from holding a political post for a year. Returning to Ukraine, she traveled to Huliaipole, now an autonomous area under Nestor Makhno's anarchist control, dubbed the Free Territory. Unwilling to damage his alliance with the Red Army, Makhno refused to disobey the sentence and would not appoint her to a position in his Black Army, the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. Unable to command a fighting force for, she worked alongside Makhno by making public speeches, and organizing propaganda events.\n\nAntonov-Ovseenko recalled meeting her on April 28, 1919, while reviewing Makhno's troops and the city of Gulyai-Polye (Huliaipole). \"Makhno introduces the members of the Gulyai-Polye soviet's executive committee and of his staff. Also there is the political commissar of the bridge, my old acquaintance, Marussia Nikiforova.\" Seeking to clarify rumors of corruption and counter-revolutionary activity among Makhno's ranks and the soviet of the city, Antonov-Ovseenko wrote glowingly of his impression of Gulyai-Polye. His report intrigued prominent Bolsheviks, who decided to visit the city personally. Lev Kamenev and a delegation of Ukrainian politicians, arrived by armored train a week following Antonov-Ovseenko visit, on May 7. Nikiforova met them at the train station, and with other members of Makhno's staff, Boris Veretelnikov and Mikhalev-Pavlenko, offered to escort them into the city. After meeting Makhno and touring the city, Kamenev was impressed with Nikiforova, and upon returning to Ekaterinoslav, he telegraphed Moscow officials. He ordered that her sentence be reduced, from a year, to \"six months deprivation of the right to hold responsible posts.\" However, given the overwhelmingly anti-anarchist propaganda among Bolshevik commanders, politicians, and media, Antonov-Ovseenko's attempts to lobby for military support for the anarchists faltered. His political power declined, and he was replaced within weeks of his visit, on June 15, by Jukums Vācietis.\n\nIn June 1919, Makhno's anarchist armies were outlawed by the Bolshevik command, and came under attack. Facing a two-front war against the white and red armies, Maria gathered a group of fighters, and reunited with her husband Witold Brzostek. Her intention was to field terrorist cells, as a formal fighting force was no longer available. Dispatching three cells on various missions, she took part in a sabotage mission against the White movement in the city of Sevastopol. There she and Bzhostek were recognized and arrested. Tried on September 16, 1919, she and her husband were found guilty and sentenced to death. Both were shot.\n\nIn her youth, Nikiforova entered anarcho-communist politics and adopted militant tactics to pursue them. Throughout her years of activism, Nikiforova gave numerous speeches espousing her political opinions. However, transcriptions and quotes from her speeches scarcely survived the Soviet era, and she was not known to write her views in letters, essays, or articles. What is known of her speeches is that she was widely regarded for her charismatic oratory, which she used to expound anarchist views. Widely known as an anarchist, she was said to constantly wear entirely black clothing as a symbol of her libertarian philosophy.\n\nDuring times of revolution, she favored immediate and complete redistribution of property owned by wealthy land owners, declaring, \"The workers and peasants must, as quickly as possible, seize everything that was created by them over many centuries and use it for their own interests.\"\n\nHowever, while she constantly spoke in favor of anarchist philosophy, she warned against vanguardism and elitism, insisting that anarchists could not guarantee positive social change. \"The anarchists are not promising anything to anyone.\" She cautioned, \"The anarchists only want people to be conscious of their own situation and seize freedom for themselves.\"\n\nWhile living in exile in Paris, she sided with Peter Kropotkin on the issue of World War I, favoring the Allies in opposition to the German Empire. She graduated from French military school at the officer rank and served in the army.\n\nUpon returning to Russia in 1917, Nikiforova was influenced by Apollon Karelin, a veteran anarchist who advocated a tactical strategy of \"Soviet anarchism.\" Meeting her in Petrograd, Karelin's political tactics encouraged anarchist participation in Soviet institutions with the long term plan of directing them towards an anarchist agenda, provided these institutions did not deviate from revolutionary goals. In the event that they deviated from a radical agenda, anarchists were to rebel against them. Such institutional cooperation was widely disliked among anarchists, as they were largely a minority within such institutions, rendering their activity ineffectual.\n\nNikiforova agreed to ally with the Bolsheviks under special circumstances and negotiated to have herself appointed to a soviet institution, briefly becoming the Deputy leader of the Alexandrovsk revkom. She would go on to help establish footholds for Soviet power in several Ukrainian cities, demanding material support from Bolshevik agents in return, which she then used to pursue her anarchist agenda. Although she would ally herself with the Red Army on multiple occasions, she was constantly at odds with their commanders and personally antagonized several, arguing against some their practices on revolutionary grounds. Upon discovering that a Soviet commander was hoarding luxury goods looted from an aristocrat's home, she angrily confronted him for his selfishness. \"The property of the estate owners doesn't belong to any particular detachment,\" she declared \"but to the people as a whole. Let the people take what they want.\"\n\nFollowing Nikiforova's death, several publications described her in terms which placed emphasis on her supposed unattractiveness. Chudnov, a former Makhnovist, wrote of her when recalling a 1918 meeting: \"This was a woman of 32 – 35, medium height, with an emaciated, prematurely aged face in which there was something of a eunuch or hermaphrodite. Her hair was cropped short in a circle.\" Years after meeting her in 1919, Aleksei Kiselyov described her in his memoirs: \"Around 30 years old. Thin with an emaciated face, she produced the impression of an old maid type. Narrow nose. Sunken cheeks. She wore a blouse and skirt and a small revolver hung from her belt.\" Kiselev also alleged that she was a cocaine addict. Nikiforova biographer, Malcolm Archibald, noted that most Bolshevik writers described her in ways similar to this, and hypothesized that this was part of an effort to discredit her ideas with ad hominem attacks. \"One suspects the Bolshevik memoirists, finding her ideology unattractive, tried to make her external appearance ugly as well.\"\n\nDescriptions of Nikiforova fall into two general categories, either highlighting an alleged repulsiveness, or beauty. An exception to the majority of Bolshevik descriptions, Raksha recalled his 1918 meeting with her in very positive terms: \"I had heard that she was a beautiful woman... Marusya was sitting at a table and had a cigarette in her teeth. This she-devil really was a beauty: about 30, gypsy-type with black hair and a magnificent bosom which filled out her military tunic.\"\n\nThroughout her life, Nikiforova had been wounded multiple times, or had been mistaken for dead, only to reappear in good health later. Due to her reputation within folklore, rumors spread in the months following her death that she was actually still alive.\n\nMarusya copycats\n\nFollowing her death, Nikiforova's surviving legacy created an opportunity for copycatsfaux Marusyasto appear in the months and years to follow. The only female atamansha while alive, Nikiforova was followed by three women fighters in the Ukrainian War of Independence who adopted her name for propaganda purposes.\n\nIn 1919, Marusya Sokolovskaia became the commander of her brother's cavalry detachment after his death in battle. A 25-year-old Ukrainian nationalist school teacher, she was captured by the Reds and shot. In 1920-1921, \"Black Maria\" (Marusya Chernaya) became a commander of a cavalry regiment in the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. She died in battle against the Red Army. A final copycat, Marusya Kosova, appeared in the Tambov Rebellion in 1921-1922. After the revolt was suppressed, she disappeared.\n\nInternational espionage rumors\n\nNikiforova was rumored to have become a spy for the Soviet government in Paris in the years following her death. There, it was claimed, she performed undercover work, and was involved in the assassination of Symon Petliura, an exiled Ukrainian nationalist and former leader of the Ukrainian People's Republic. In actuality, Petliura was assassinated by Sholom Schwartzbard. A fellow exile and Ukrainian-Jewish anarchist, and former member of Grigori Kotovsky's anarchist detachment, Schwartzbard had worked alone in the assassination. Malcolm Archibald commented, \"The only truth in this story might be the fact of anarchists doing the Bolshevik's work for them.\"\n\nNikiforova left few written records or photographs of herself during much of her life. This is owed in part to her hidden activity as an international terrorist. Operating underground, and in exile across multiple countries, Nikiforova did not begin to make her activity public knowledge until the last two years of her life, when she officially held a military command. A few contemporary records of her life survived the Soviet era. Nestor Makhno provided eye-witness accounts of several dramatic incidents in Nikiforova's life within his memoirs. Makhno's former adjutant, Viktor Belash, also wrote of her life within his own records, which were rescued from files held by the Soviet secret police. Briefly a member of the Red Army, Nikiforova's service record exists as one of the few official documentations of her life.\n\nNikiforova has been largely ignored by historians since her death. Soviet-era historians largely erased her from history, despite the important role she played in the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and subsequent civil war. A biographical dictionary of the Russian Revolution includes hundreds of entries, but does not include her. Of the few Bolshevik women who are included, none held military commands as Nikiforova did. There is no scholarly biography of her life, or historiography of her era which mentions her. The few references made to her by Bolshevik contemporaries in memoirs and works of fiction are biased against her. These depict her uniformly as \"repulsive and evil,\" with little exception.\n\nNikiforova has also been ignored by non-Soviet historians. Today, Nikiforova remains obscure and uncelebrated within Ukraine. She has been ignored by Ukrainian historians. Critics of this treatment speculate that as an anti-nationalist who fought and was executed by the White Army, Nikforova's activities have been too difficult to rewrite and reconcile to fit a reformist historical narrative.\n\nThere is little explanation for the neglect on the part of anarchist historians. While several biographies of Nestor Makhno have been published, there is little mention of Nikiforova. This is despite their close collaboration, and her greater contemporary prominence, according to biographer Malcolm Archibald: \"...in 1918 Nikiforova was already famous as an anarchist atamansha (military female leader) throughout Ukraine, while Makhno was still a rather obscure figure operating in a provincial backwater.\" Of several anarchist historians who have published histories regarding Makhno, only Alexandre Skirda's work, \"Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack\", mentions hera single paragraph, out of over 400 pages, is devoted to her.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, historians have attempted to reintroduce individuals expunged from history, such as Nikiforova, Makhno, and other anarchists. Several essays on Nikiforova have been published, and the Nikiforova biography, \"Atamansha\", published in 2007, was based on such sources in Russia and the Ukraine.\n\nNikiforova appears in the French novel \"Clarisse\", by Cecil Saint-Laurent. She keeps Clarisse prisoner in her armoured train in Ukraine, and the two women become lovers, Clarisse being deflowered by Nikiforova.\n\n\n. Historian Michael Palij refers to this city as \"Oleksandrivsk\". This should not be confused with contemporary Oleksandrivsk, as the city's Russian name formally matched Nikiforova's home city, Alexandrovsk. However, the two cities are located in entirely different regions of the Ukraine.\n\n"}

Meskhetians are indigenous population of Meskheti, historical region in southern Georgia. Today they are mainly followers of Georgian Orthodox Church, while part of them are Catholics.\n\nSeveral authors have connected Meskhetians or Meskhians to Mushki tribe or Moschoi (Μόσχοι) in Greek sources, who were an Iron Age people of Anatolia. Meskhian tribes came to the fore, gradually moving northeast and forming their settlements in the very heart of Kartli. Mtskheta, the ancient capital of Iberia (literarily means \"town of Meskhs\") was one such settlements, deriving its name from the ethnonym \"Meskhians\". According to the Cyril Toumanoff, Moschians were the early proto-Georgian tribes which played a leading role in the consolidation of Iberian tribes largely inhabiting eastern and southern Georgia. \n\nBetween 9th-11th centuries Mesketi, also known as Tao-Klarjeti, was governed by the Bagrationi dynasty and the region played a crucial role in the unification of the Georgian principalities into a single Georgian state in 1008. Meskheti gave many prominent people to the Georgia: such as Shota Rustaveli, who is considered to be the preeminent poet of the Georgian Golden Age and one of the greatest contributors to Georgian literature. Rustaveli is the author of \"The Knight in the Panther's Skin\", which is considered to be a Georgian national epic poem.\n\nThereafter, the kingdom of Georgia declined and eventually disintegrated under hegemony of various regional powers, including the Mongols, Timurids, Black and White Sheeps. After the Mongol invasion of Georgia, Meskhetian princes gained virtual independence from the Georgian crown and established Principality of Samtskhe under the mongol patronage.\n\nBy the Peace of Amasya (1555), Principality of Samtskhe was divided into two, with the Safavids keeping the eastern part and the Ottomans gaining the western part. In 1578, the Ottomans performed a successful invasion into the Safavid possessions in Georgia, initiating the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590, and by 1582 they were in possession of the eastern (Safavid) part of Meskheti as well. \n\nThe Georgian population of Meskheti was displaced to inner regions of Georgia such as Imereti and Kartli. Those who remained gradually became Muslim, the process is also known as Turkification of Meskhetians (then Meskehtian Turks).\n\n"}

{"id": "14880576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14880576", "title": "Militant activity of Osama bin Laden", "text": "Militant activity of Osama bin Laden\n\nOsama bin Laden, a militant Islamist and reported founder al-Qaeda, in conjunction with several other Islamic militant leaders, issued two fatawa — in 1996 and then again in 1998—that military personnel from the United States and allied countries until they withdraw support for Israel and withdraw military forces from Islamic countries. He was indicted in United States federal court for his alleged involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya, and was on the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list until his death.\n\nAlthough bin Laden was never indicted for the September 11, 2001 attacks, he had claimed responsibility for them in videos released to the public.\n\nBin Laden's wealth and connections assisted his interest in supporting the mujahideen, Muslim guerrillas fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. His old teacher from the university in Jeddah, Abdullah Azzam, had relocated to Peshawar, a major border city in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. From there, Azzam was able to organize resistance directly on the Afghan frontier. Peshawar is only east of the Khyber Pass, through the Safed Koh mountains, connected to the southeastern edge of the Hindu Kush range. This route became the major avenue of inserting foreign fighters and material support into eastern Afghanistan for the resistance against the Soviets.\n\nAfter leaving college in 1979 bin Laden joined Azzam to fight the Soviet Invasion and lived for a time in Peshawar. According to Rahimullah Yousufzai, \"Azzam prevailed on him to come and use his money\" for training recruits. In the early 1980s, bin Laden lived at several addresses in and around Arbab Road, a narrow street in the University Town neighborhood in western Peshawar, Yusufzai said. Nearby in Gulshan Iqbal Road is the Arab mosque that Abdullah Azzam used as the jihad center, according to a Reuters inquiry in the neighborhood.\n\nBy 1984, with Azzam, bin Laden established a Saudi Arabian funded organization named Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK, \"Office of Order\" in English), which funneled money, arms and Muslim fighters from around the Arabic world into the Afghan war. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's inherited family fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation, dealt with paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihad fighters. In running al-Khadamat, bin Laden set up a network of couriers traveling between Afghanistan and Peshawar, which remained active after 2001, according to Rahimullah Yusufzai. It was during this time that Bin Laden met his future al-Qaeda collaborator, Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, a member and later head of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad.\n\nWhether Osama bin Laden and his group are \"blowback\" from CIA's Operation Cyclone to help the Afghan mujahideen is a matter of some debate.\n\nRobin Cook, UK Foreign Secretary from 1997–2001 and Leader of the House of Commons from 2001-2003, has written that bin Laden was, \"a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies\" and that the mujahideen that formed Al-Qaeda were \"originally ... recruited and trained with help from the CIA\".\n\nHowever, CNN journalist Peter Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with Osama bin Laden in 1997, calls the idea \"that the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden ... a folk myth. There's no evidence of this. ... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently. ... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.\"\n\nOsama bin Laden was recruited to be part of Azzam's Maktab al-Khadimat (Services Bureau), the support network of Arab fighters in Pakistan that was helping resist the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. For a while, bin Laden worked at the Services Bureau working with Abdullah Azzam on Jihad Magazine, a magazine that gave information about the war with the Soviets and interviewed mujahideen. Although bin Laden and the other Afghan Arabs were considered a minor \"sideshow\" in the war, bin Laden did establish a camp in Afghanistan and, with other volunteers, fought the Soviets and Marxist Afghan troops. One of his most significant battles was the battle of Jaji, which was not a major fight, but it earned him a reputation as a fighter.\n\nAs time passed, Ayman al-Zawahiri encouraged bin Laden to split away from Abdullah Azzam. This stemmed from al-Zawahiri's differences with Azzam such as their conflicting interpretations of the jihad. Some believe that al-Zawahiri's motive was driven by his desire to exploit bin Laden's finances as well as the ambition to control the fractured Egyptian jihadist movement and so al-Zawahiri favored an aggressive view. On the other hand, Azzam pushed for a limited and defensive conception of jihad, where it becomes obligatory only when the enemy enters the land of Muslims. This doctrine, however, proved ambiguous and invited several interpretations. Bin Laden began gravitating towards Zawahiri's position as he pursued a more expansive warfare strategy that allowed \"insurrections against apostate Muslim regimes.\" Azzam rejected this because he eschewed intra-Muslim conflict and the dispute finally led to a power struggle, which bin Laden won. By 1988, he finally broke away from his mentor, establishing al-Qaeda with the most extremist of the Muslim militants from Azzam's network and began a radical form of jihad that pursued the violent overthrow of governments in the Muslim world deemed apostate.\n\nYears later, in 1989, Azzam was blown up in a massive car bombing outside the mosque. Bin Laden is thought by some to be behind the assassination due to the rift about the direction of the jihad at that time. Others, however, doubt this claim; Ahmad Zaidan, for instance, author of the Arabic-language book \"Bin Laden Unmasked\", told Peter L. Bergen in an interview, \"I rule out totally that bin Laden would indulge himself in such things, after all, Osama bin Laden, he's not type of person to kill Abdullah Azzam. Otherwise, if he be exposed, he would be finished, totally.\" Bergen also cites Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who speculates that there were more likely candidates than bin Laden: \"It could be Hekmatyar, it could be KHAD, it could be the Mossad, the Egyptians [around Ayman al Zawahiri] … I met with Hekmatyar, an arrogant, self-centered person. I think Hekmatyar had a secret organization to eliminate his enemies.\"\n\nBy 1988, bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat because of strategic differences. While Azzam and his MAK organization acted as support for the Afghan fighters and provided relief to refugees and injured, bin Laden wanted a more military role in which the Arab fighters would not only be trained and equipped by the organization but also led on the battlefield by Arabic commanders. One of the main leading points to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was the insistence of Azzam that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming their separate fighting force.\n\nIn 1990 Bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia a hero of jihad, celebrated in the Saudi press as a pious, courageous warrior who, along with his Arab legion, \"had brought down the mighty superpower\" of the Soviet Union. However, at about the same time Iraq invaded neighbor Kuwait and bin Laden was alarmed at the prospect that foreign non-Muslim troops would enter the kingdom to fight Iraq. He met Saudi Prince Sultan, the Minister of Defense, and offered to help defend Saudi Arabia:\n\n[Bin Laden:] I am ready to prepare 100,000 fighters with good combat capability within three months. You don't need Americans. You don't need any other non-Muslim troops. We will be enough.\n\n[Prince Sultan:] There are no caves in Kuwait. What will you do when he lobs missiles at you with chemical and biological weapons?\n\n[Bin Laden:] We will fight him with faith. \n\nBin Laden was rebuffed and publicly denounced Saudi Arabia's dependence on the U.S. military, demanding an end to the presence of foreign military bases in the country. Other Saudi Muslims were also greatly upset that non-Muslim troops would be on the same peninsula as the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Anti-government Islamist militants in Saudi Arabia were even more inflamed when the foreign bases remained after the Gulf War was over.\n\nBin Laden's increasingly strident criticisms of the Saudi monarchy led the government to attempt to silence him. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, \"with help from a dissident member of the royal family, he managed to get out of the country under the pretext of attending an Islamic gathering in Pakistan in April 1991.\" Another report has bin Laden retrieving his passport from the Saudi government to go to Peshawar in March 1992 to mediate the Afghan Civil War. In any case Hassan al-Turabi, leader of the National Islamic Front, had invited bin Laden to \"transplant his whole organization to Sudan\" in 1989. Bin Laden's agents had begun purchasing property in Sudan in 1990. Bin Laden moved to Sudan in 1992.\n\nOne of the former State Department officials described Bosnia and Herzegovina of that time as a safe haven for terrorists, after it was revealed that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists include hard-core terrorists, some with ties to Osama bin Laden. In 1997, Rzeczpospolita, one of the largest Polish daily newspapers, reported that intelligence services of the Nordic-Polish SFOR Brigade suspected that a center for training terrorists from Islamic countries was located in the Bocina Donja village near Maglaj in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1992, thousands of volunteers joined an \"all-mujahedeen unit\" called El Moujahed, which was headquartered in Zenica in an abandoned hillside factory, a compound with a hospital and prayer hall. According to Middle East intelligence reports. Bin Laden financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in Sudan. Among them was Karim Said Atmani who was identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in the USA. He is a former roommate of Ahmed Ressam, the man arrested at the Canadian-U.S. border in mid-December 1999 with a car full of nitroglycerin and bomb-making materials. He was convicted of colluding with Osama bin Laden by a French court. A Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed other former mujahideen who are linked to the same Algerian group or to other suspected terrorist groups and who have lived in this area 60 miles north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years. Khalil al-Deek, was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites; a second man with Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with Osama Bin Laden. In its June 26, 1997 Report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the New York Times noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslims forces. Further, the terrorists also admitted to ties with Osama Bin Laden. In 1999 it was revealed that Osama bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and Bosnian passport in 1993 by the Government in Sarajevo. This information was denied by Bosnian government following the 9/11 attacks but it was later found out that Aodouni was arrested in Turkey and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation new explanation was given that bin Laden \"did not personally collect his Bosnian passport\" and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who bin Laden was at the time. The Bosnian daily Oslobođenje published in 2001 that three men, believed linked to be linked to Osama Bin Laden, were arrested in Sarajevo in July 2001. The three, one of whom was identified as Imad El Misri, were Egyptian nationals. The paper said that two of the suspects were holding Bosnian passports.\n\nIn 1998 it was reported that bin Laden is operating his terrorist network out of Albania. The Charleston Gazette quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of the Albanian intelligence service, as saying a network run by Saudi exile Osama Bin Laden sent units to fight in the Serbian province of Kosovo. Confirmation of these activities came from Claude Kader, a French national who said he was a member of Bin Laden's Albanian network. He claimed he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters for Kosovo. In 2000 bin Laden was operating from Kosovo planning the terrorist activities during the Insurgency in the Preševo Valley.\n\nConnections between bin Laden and National Liberation Army, an insurgent, guerrilla organization that operated in the Republic of Macedonia in 2001 were also drawn. According to the Washington Times the NLA was fighting to keep control over the region’s drug trafficking, which had grown into a large, lucrative enterprise since the Kosovo war and that in addition to drug money, the NLA also had another prominent venture capitalist, Osama Bin Laden. According to a document written by the chief commander of the Macedonian Security Forces, bin Laden was financing the rebel group through a representative in Macedonia. Osama Bin Laden, paid $6 to $7 million for the needs of the National Liberation Army through his representative. Osama Bin Laden was planning to gain control over Macedonia so that he could control the distribution of oil to the United States through the pipeline that was planned to stretch from Bulgaria to Albania ports.\n\nAssisted by donations funneled through business and charitable fronts such as Benevolence International, established by his brother-in-law, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, and especially by his stipend from the Bin Laden family business empire, bin Laden established a new base for mujahideen operations in Khartoum, Sudan to disseminate Islamist philosophy and recruit operatives in Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and the United States. Bin Laden also invested in business ventures, such as al-Hajira, a construction company that built roads throughout Sudan, and Wadi al-Aqiq, an agricultural corporation that farmed hundreds of thousands of acres of sorghum, gum Arabic, sesame and sunflowers in Sudan's central Gezira province. Bin Laden's operations in Sudan were protected by the powerful Sudanese NIF government figure Hassan al Turabi, but were not profitable. While in Sudan, bin Laden married one of Turabi's nieces.\n\nBin Laden continued his verbal assault on Saudi King Fahd, for example by financing an Advice and Reformation Committee in London that \"sent faxes by the hundreds to prominent Saudis\" denouncing the king and corruption in the kingdom. On 5 March 1994, the King retaliated by personally revoking his citizenship and sending an embassary to Sudan to demand bin Laden's passport so that he no longer travel. His family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend equivalent of about $7 million a year.\n\nBy now Bin Laden was strongly associated with Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) who made up the core of al-Qaeda by this time. In 1995 EIJ attempted to assassinate Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak with the help of al-Gama'a al-Islamiya and the Sudanese intelligence service. The attempt failed and disastrous backlash ensued. The EIJ was abruptly expelled from Sudan and bin Laden pressured to go as well. He took a chartered flight to Jalalabad, Afghanistan and began building a network of contacts.\n\nSudanese officials, whose government was under international sanctions, offered to expel Osama bin Laden to Saudi Arabia in the mid-1990s provided that the Saudis pardon him. The Saudis refused because they had already revoked his citizenship and would not accept him in their country.\nConsequently, in May 1996, under increasing pressure from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United States, Sudan asked bin Laden to leave. Bin Laden was forced to make a distress sale of his assets in Sudan that left with almost nothing.\n\nHe returned to Afghanistan on a chartered plane and flew to Kabul before settling in the Nazim Jihad compound in Jalalabad after being invited by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan, a member of the Afghan Northern Alliance. After spending a few months with these three leaders in the border region hosted by them, bin Laden forged a close relationship with selected leaders of Afghanistan's new Taliban government, notably Mullah Mohammed Omar. Bin Laden supported the Taliban regime with financial and paramilitary assistance and, in 1997, he moved to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Bin Laden and al-Qaeda were able to raise some money from \"donors from the days of the Soviet jihad,\" and from the Pakistan ISI which paid them to train militants for the fight against India in Kashmir. This was done at the old al-Qaeda camps in Khost which the ISI had persuaded the Taliban to return to al-Qaeda control.\n\nSeveral years before bin Laden was well known outside of Saudi and Islamist circles, he assisted and/or funded what he believed to be physical jihad against impiety involving attacks on civilians.\n\nWhile still in Saudi Arabia in 1989, he angered the Saudi royal family by preaching for and financing assassinations of socialist leaders in the neighboring country of Yemen, his father's homeland, where the country was in the process of re-uniting under a coalition government.\n\nIn 1992 or 1993, bin Laden sent an emissary, Qari el-Said, with $40,000 to Algeria to aid the Islamists there and warn them against compromise with the impious government. Making jihad merely \"for politics, not for God\" would be a sin, they were told; total war was the only solution. Total war did follow involving many massacres of civilians and a declaration of takfir of Algerians by one of the Islamist factions (the GIA). An estimated 150,000–200,000 Algerians were killed by the end of the war, but the government prevailed over the Islamists. Abdullah Anas, an Algerian Islamist witness to the Al-Qaeda advice, later lamented, `This simple argument destroyed us.`\n\nAnother unsuccessful effort by bin Laden was the Luxor massacre of November 17, 1997, which Swiss federal police are reported to have found was funded by Bin Laden.\nThe attack by six al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya militants dressed as policemen slaughtered 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians at Luxor Temple. Its goal was to derail the nonviolence initiative between the Egyptian government and Egyptian-based al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the major Egyptian militant Islamist group, but the attack horrified the Egyptian public and turned it completely against Islamist terror.\n\nA later attack that did succeed, at least temporarily, was that on the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif. While in Afghanistan, bin Laden helped cement his alliance with his hosts, the ruling Taliban, by sending several hundred of his Afghan Arab fighters along to help the Taliban overrun Mazar-e-Sharif. The city fell, but journalists report it as a particularly gruesome conquest.\n\nIt is believed that the first terrorist attack involving bin Laden was the 29 December 1992, bombing of the Gold Mihor Hotel in Aden, Yemen. The attack was intended to kill American troops on the way to Somalia, but the soldiers were staying in a different hotel. The bombs killed a Yemeni hotel employee and an Austrian national and also seriously injured the Austrian's wife.\n\nIt was after this bombing that al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justificiation for the killing of innocent people, such as the two bystanders at the hotel. According to a fatwa issued by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim (aka, Abu Hajer al Iraqi), the most Islamically knowledgeable of Al-Qaeda's members, the killing of someone merely standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander, like the Yemini hotel worker, will find their proper reward in death, going to Paradise if they were good Muslims and to hell if they were bad or non-believers. The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the public.\n\nIn 1998, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, (a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad), co-signed a \"fatwa\" (religious edict) in the name of the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, declaring:\nIn response to the 1998 United States embassy bombings following the fatwa, President Bill Clinton ordered a freeze on assets that could be linked to bin Laden. Clinton also signed an executive order, authorizing bin Laden's arrest or assassination. In August 1998, the U.S. launched an attack using cruise missiles. The attack failed to harm bin Laden but killed 22 people.\n\nOn 4 November 1998, Osama bin Laden was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury, and the United States Department of State offered a US$5 million reward for information leading to bin Laden's apprehension or conviction.\n\nIn an interview with journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai published in \"Time magazine\", 11 January 1999, Osama bin Laden is quoted as saying:\n\nFollowing the 2000 USS Cole bombing, Mohammed Atef was moved to Kandahar, Zawahiri to Kabul, and Bin Laden fled to Kabul, later joining Atef when he realised no American reprisal attacks were forthcoming.\n\nThe Government of the United Kingdom stated that evidence linking Al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks of September 11 is clear and irrefutable. However, a \"White Paper\" by the U.S. government, documenting the case against bin Laden and the Al Qaeda organization concerning the September 11 attacks, publicly promised by Secretary of State Colin Powell, was never published. So far, the U.S. Justice Department has not sought formal criminal charges against bin Laden (or anyone but Zacarias Moussaoui) for the 9/11 attacks. This has provided what some call \"fodder for conspiracy theorists who think the U.S. government or another power was behind the Sept. 11 hijackings.\" Two separate indictments were made against bin Laden by two separate grand juries in 1998 for two separate terrorist acts, though no indictments have been filed against him for the events of 9/11.\n\nBin Laden initially denied involvement in the September 11, 2001 attacks while praising them effusely, explaining their motivation, and dismissing American accusations of his involvement as an example of its hatred for Islam. On 16 September 2001, bin Laden read a statement later broadcast by Qatar's Al Jazeera satellite channel saying:\nI stress that I have not carried out this act, which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation.\nGod has struck America at its Achilles heel and destroyed its greatest buildings, praise and blessing to Him. Bin Laden claimed the Taliban were being attacked by American forces\nbecause of their religion, not just because of the presence of Osama bin Laden … It is a known fact that America is against the establishment of any Islamic state.\n\nIn early November 2001, the Taliban government announced they were bestowing official Afghan citizenship on him, as well as Zawahiri, Mohammed Atef, and Shaykh Asim Abdulrahman.\n\nIn November 2001, U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. In it Osama bin Laden discusses the attack with an old mujahideen friend Khaled al-Harbi in a way indicating foreknowledge of the attack. \"We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy;\" and \"We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event [the 9/11 attack] would take place that day.\" The tape was broadcast on various news networks on 13 December 2001. Some have disputed this translation however. On 20 December 2001, German TV channel \"Das Erste\" broadcast its analysis of the White House's translation of the videotape. On the show Monitor, two independent translators and an expert on oriental studies found the White House's translation to be not only inaccurate, but also \"manipulative\". Arabist Dr. Abdel El M. Husseini, one of the translators, stated: \"I have carefully examined the Pentagon's translation. This translation is very problematic. At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of Bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic.\"\n\nAnother bin Laden video was released on 27 December 2001, with much the same message as his first. America had accused him of organizing the attacks because of \"Crusader hatred for the Islamic World.\nTerrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to … the continuous injustice inflicted upon our sons in Palestine, Iraq, Somalia, southern Sudan, and … Kashmir.\n\nShortly before the U.S. presidential election in 2004, another taped statement was released and aired on Al Jazeera in which bin Laden abandoned his denials without retracting past statements. In it he told viewers he had personally directed the 19 hijackers, and gave what he claimed was his motivation:\n\nI will explain to you the reasons behind these events, and I will tell you the truth about the moments when this decision was taken, so that you can reflect on it. God knows that the plan of striking the towers had not occurred to us, but the idea came to me when things went just too far with the American-Israeli alliance's oppression and atrocities against our people in Palestine and Lebanon.\n\nAccording to the tapes, bin Laden claimed he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War.\n\nIn two other tapes aired by Al Jazeera in 2006, Osama bin Laden announces, I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers … I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers … with the raids [5 minute audiotape broadcast May 23, 2006], and is seen with Ramzi bin al-Shibh, as well as two of the 9/11 hijackers, Hamza al-Ghamdi and Wail al-Shehri, as they make preparations for the attacks (videotape broadcast September 7, 2006).\n\nDespite this, bin Laden is reported to have complained as recently as November 2007 of the lack \"of evidence admissible in court\" tying him and his organization to the 9/11 attack.\n"}

She had an elder brother, Ali Bey (born 1890), and two younger brothers, Şaban Bey (1895 – 1960), and Fevzi Bey (1897 – 1953).\n\nHer paternal aunt Habibe Hanım, who had been a hazinedar in Mehmed's harem, took her for service in the Dolmabahçe Palace. She was then placed in the service of Şayeste Hanım in the Çengelköy Palace.\n\nMüveddet married Mehmed on 25 April 1911 in the mansion of Çengelköy. A year after the marriage, on 5 October 1912, she gave birth to the couple's only son, Şehzade Mehmed Ertuğrul. After Mehmed's accession to the throne on 4 July 1918, she was given the title of \"Ikinci Kadın\".\n\nHe was deposed on 1 November 1922, and went to exile with their son Ertuğrul on 17 November 1922. She, together with other members of his family, was kept in house arrest at the Feriye Palace by order of the new parliament until 10 March 1924, when they were sent into exile. Müveddet joined Mehmed in San Remo.\n\nAfter Mehmed's death in 1926, Müveddet went to Paris with his daughter Ulviye Sultan. She stayed with her in her villa for some time, and later moved to the villa of Sami Bey, the son of Mediha Sultan.\n\nIn 1929, Müveddet went to Alexandria, and married Şakir Bey, son of Emin Pasha on 2 May 1932.

{"id": "14295551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14295551", "title": "Name-letter effect", "text": "Name-letter effect\n\nThe name-letter effect is the tendency of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out of a set of two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.\n\nDiscovered in 1985 by the Belgian psychologist Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for initials, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.\n\nMost people like themselves; the name is associated with the self, and hence the letters of the name are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other words. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.\n\nThere is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.\n\nSystematic interest in the letter preference began in 1959 with brand-preference studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of letters for use in package labels. In an extension of the studies, subjects were asked to rank the English alphabet by the pleasantness of the appearance of capital letters. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the coefficients of concordance were low), a strong positive correlation was found between a letter's average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of family names.\n\nRobert Zajonc, a social psychologist, published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of words (e.g. \"on\" or \"off\"): in the overwhelming majority of trials the preferred word was also the most common. Zajonc also tested preferences for nonsense words and found that people liked them the more they heard them. He interpreted these results as evidence that mere repeated exposure to a stimulus is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.\n\nAround 1977, Belgian experimental psychologist Jozef Nuttin was driving on a highway looking at license plates when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name. He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a \"mere belongingness\" as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.\n\nIn his lab at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Nuttin designed experiments to test the hypothesis that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name. It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.\n\nTo find an effect which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a yoked control design in which two subjects evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.\n\nFor example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.\n\nIn the first trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local elementary school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.\n\nNuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, acoustical, aesthetic, semantic, and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters. He framed the effect in the context of narcissism, Gestalt theory and awareness, as reflected in the title of his 1985 article \"Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect\", in which \"beyond Gestalt\" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and \"beyond awareness\" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used. Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.\n\nIn 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.\n\nCross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the only one with a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.\n\nAcross languages and letters, the average probability of a letter being chosen as one of the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree. The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.\n\nNuttin analyzed the data to see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for Magyarország). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.\n\nThe data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.\n\nAs in the first study, the second one also included a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While there was a large consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.\n\nIn the light of how surprising the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the European Association of Experimental Social Psychology in 1984, followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected. Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect \"so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously think of an artifact\". Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was spurious, but they doubted its psychological relevance. In the first five years after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university (Ohio State University, where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).\n\nThis all changed in 1995, when Greenwald and Banaji pointed out that Nuttin's work was relevant to indirect measurement of self-esteem, which Nuttin himself had actually already suggested. After that the original study was cited 14 times in the five years between 1995 and 1999, 50 times between 2000 and 2004, 114 times between 2005 and 2009, and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014. The name-letter effect is no longer disputed and Nuttin's work has been called \"seminal\" by Stieger, Voracek, and Formann in their 2012 meta-analysis of 44 publications on the effect. Their meta-analysis found no trace of publication bias.\n\nIn her 2014 meta-analysis of dozens of name-letter effect studies, Hoorens called the effect robust. She noted robustness in:\n\n\nVarious explanations for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected.\n\nPeople may simply like most what they see most. Letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.\n\nSubjective frequency is how frequently subjects a stimulus appears. Name letters may be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the frequency was identical. Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for the name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect. The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect than those who did not like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.\n\nEvaluative conditioning suggests that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, it could be that the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.\n\nSubjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose the letters from their own name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.\n\nThe letters first learned by a child, commonly their own name, may come to have lasting positive associations. Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their mother tongue alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman. Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, there should be no name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet. Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic. The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principal cause of the name-letter effect. In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause. They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet at the same time as the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later. They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.\n\nThe effect is thought to arise from unconscious, automatic processes of self-evaluation, with different research groups coming at it from two different angles.\n\nNuttin frames the cause in terms of ownership, which has roots in economic psychology. The endowment effect has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just one example of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.\n\n\nAnother group of researchers has framed the cause in terms of social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.\n\n\nIn psychological assessments, the name-letter effect has been exploited to measure self-esteem. There are two types of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem. Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.\n\nThe Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem, surpassed only by the Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters of the alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).\n\nThere is no standard algorithm for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use. In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the ipsatized double-correction algorithm (the so-called \"I-algorithm\"), as originally recommended and named by LeBel and Gawronski). In her meta-analysis, Hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name-letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to the most important psychometric quality of all, validity. The algorithms are typically applied to initials only, but can be used for all name letters.\n\nStieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as depression, physical health, social acceptance, unrealistic optimism, feedback sensitivity, self-regulation, and defensiveness.\n\nResearchers have looked for wider implications of the name-letter effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab.\n\nIn controlled studies in the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey). The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did like Honda more than non-matching brands). They speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things. Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials. The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.\n\nWiebenga and Fennis investigated whether the use of the personal pronouns \"I\" and \"my\" in branding also had an effect on preferences, given the way these pronouns link to the self. They found that brand names with a generic self-referencing pronoun (e.g. iPhone, Myspace) were evaluated more positively than non-self-referencing brand names (e.g. Xbox). The effect behaved like the name-letter effect: when the self was put under threat the effect became stronger, and it disappeared for people with negative self-evaluations.\n\nA study by Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase the quality of group work. In a study of undergraduate students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.\n\nResearchers have looked for evidence of the driving force behind the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of implicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.  Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.\n\nSimonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An example of a confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters \"Den\" compared to with \"Wal\", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, and more likely to be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more \"Den\" dentists than \"Wal\" than implicit egotism. Using both a different data set (Twitter and Google+ accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.\n\nDyjas, Grasman, Wetzels, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers criticized the method Pelham et al. used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 \"Saint cities\" in the US, such as St. Louis and St. Paul. Whereas Pelham et al. pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name (e.g. Louis or Paul), Dyjas et al. used Bayesian hierarchical modelling to show that there are several cities where the opposite happens, people moving away from their name Saint city. They concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect. A different set of cities containing 30 surnames, such as Jackson and Johnson City, did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city–surname matches. Dyjas et al. disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname, but instead cited Simonsohn's argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away, a case of reverse causality.\n\nSimonsohn also raised the possibility of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial. But Simonsohn suspected that, like Walt Disney working for Disney, many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.\n\nA few controversial studies have linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams found no evidence of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players striking out (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was. Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower grades than others with initials A or B. Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.\n\nIn response to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something the \"New Scientist\" has coined nominative determinism. Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.\n\nResearch by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, Katrina, Rita and Mitch). They found that people who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate. Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.\n\n"}

Those refugees ended up in Sahrawi refugee camps in the Tindouf Province, Algeria. With most refugees still living in the camps, the refugee situation is among the most protracted ones worldwide.\n\nThousands of ethnic Sahrawi refugees from Western Sahara also fled to Mauritania to escape the war, which began when Morocco annexed Western Sahara in 1976. Uncertainty about the political future of Western Sahara deterred the ethnic Sahrawi refugees from returning home. \n\nSince the creation of the Sahrawi refugee problem in the 1970s, a significant number of Sahrawi refugees have tried to upgrade their status, by leaving the refugee camps in Tindouf and the northern villages in Mauritania. Some chose to immigrate to Europe, as part of the general migration wave from Africa, while others dispersed in Mauritania.\n\nThe number of Sahrawi refugees in Tinduf camps is disputed and politically sensitive. Morocco argues that Polisario and Algeria overestimate the numbers to attract political attention and foreign aid, while Polisario accuses Morocco of attempting to restrict human aid as a means of pressure on civilian refugee populations. The refugees' numbers will also be important in determining their political weight in the possible event of a referendum to determine Western Sahara's future status.\n\nAlgerian authorities have estimated the number of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria to be 165,000. This has been supported by Polisario, although the movement recognizes that some refugees have rebased to Mauritania, a country that houses about 26,000 Sahrawis refugees. UNCHR referred to Algeria's figure for many years, but in 2005 concern about it being inflated led the organization to reduce its working figure to 90,000 based on satellite imagery analysis. UNHCR is in dialogue with the Algerian Government and the Sahrawi refugee leadership, seeking to conduct a census to determine the exact number of refugees in the camps.\n\nIn 1998, UN's Minurso mission identified 42,378 voting-age adults in the camps, counting only those who had contacted the mission's registration offices and subsequently been able to prove their descent from pre-1975 Western Sahara. No attempt was made to estimate the total population number in the camps.\n\nThe Moroccan government contends that the total number of refugees is around 45,000 to 50,000, and also that these people are kept in the camps by Polisario against their will.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian assistance agencies had virtually no contact with those refugees. Most lived in the northern town of Zouérat and the coastal town of Nouadhibou on Mauritania's northern border.\n\nBy the end of 2003, there were more than 26,000 registered Sahrawi refugees in Mauritania. They formed a majority of people with refugee status in the whole Mauritania.\n\nThe Sahrawis who did not flee have been given Moroccan citizenship. Following the 1975 Green March, the Moroccan state has sponsored enticing thousands of Moroccans to move into the Moroccan-occupied part of Western Sahara (80% of the territory). By 2015, it was estimated that Moroccan settlers made up at least two thirds of the 500,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe ECHO (European Commission – Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection) allocated in 2013 some 10 million Euro for the purposes of improving living conditions of Sahrawi refugees. ECHO has so far donated nearly 200 million Euro for that purpose, beginning from 1993. The European Commission refers to the Sahrawi refugees as the \"forgotten refugees\".\n\n[[Category:North African diaspora"}

In Sahrawi society, the women share responsibilities at every level of its community and social organization. Article 41 of the Constitution of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ensures that the state will pursue \"the promotion of women and [their] political, social and cultural participation, in the construction of society and the country's development\".\n\nClothing worn by the Sahrawis include the robe called as the Daraa. Women wear the headscarf known as the mefhla.\n\nThe Polisario Front, a national liberation movement that is recognized by the United Nations as the representative of the people of Western Sahara since 1979, has attempted to modernize the society of the Sahrawi refugee camps that was set up in Tindouf Province, Algeria from 1975 to 1976, through emphasis on education, eradication of tribalism and emancipation of women. The role of Sahrawi women was central already in pre-colonial and colonial life, but was strengthened further during the war years (1975–1991), when Sahrawi women ran most of the camps' administration, while the men were fighting at the front. This together with literacy- and professional education classes produced major advances in the role of women in Sahrawi society. The return of large numbers of Sahrawi men since the cease fire in 1991 may have slowed this development according to some observers, but women still run a majority of the camps' administration, and the Sahrawi women's union UNMS is very active in promoting their role. The role of women in camps was enhanced by their shouldering of the main responsibility for the camps and government bureaucracy during the war years, as virtually the entire male population was enrolled in the Polisario army.\n\nIn the 2012 election for seats in the Sahrawi National Council, 35% of the parliamentarians were women. In the legislative election in 2008 women gained 34.61% of seats, thanks in part to a quota system.\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Chübei, and a great-great-grandson of Chagatai Khan.\n\nYasa'ur had originally resided within the Chagatai \"ulus\". In 1314 he participated in a campaign against the Ilkhanate, together with the Chagatai Khan's brother Kebek and a Neguderi prince Daud Khwaja(a son of Qutlugh Khwaja) who had been expelled from his territories by the Ilkhan the previous year. Their forces defeated the Ilkhan army near the banks of the Murgab River; they then marched to Herat. The Ilkhan Öljeitü then set off with an army for the east, while the Chagataiid forces were recalled by the khan Esen Buqa. \n\nAround this time Yasa'ur, who had been accused by Kebek of cooperated with the Ilkhanid forces during the invasion, defected to Öljeitü. His forces engaged in battle with the Chagataiid troops; an Ilkhanid army that had crossed the Oxus joined the fighting and secured victory for Yasa'ur. He, escorted by the Ilkhanid force, entered Khorasan; Öljeitü then allowed him to take control of the pasture lands of the Badghis.\n\nÖljeitü died in 1316 and was succeeded as Ilkhan by his son Abu Sa'id. Yasa'ur initially pledged loyalty to the new Ilkhan, but was apparently uncooperative with Ilkhanid authorities. In early 1319 he openly revolted against Abu Sa'id, invading the province of Mazandaran. This revolt coincided with an invasion by Uzbeg Khan, forcing the Ilkhanids to defend against two attacks simultaneously. Amir Husain (the father of Hasan Buzurg, who founded the Jalayirid dynasty in Baghdad) was sent to deal with Yasa'ur. The Amir Coban, overestimating the strength of Yasa'ur, also planned to march against the Chagataiid prince at the head of a 20,000-strong army, but eventually decided to defend against Uzbeg's forces. \n\nAmir Husain's approach caused Yasa'ur to retreat from Mazandaran. From Tus he then sent a force to take Herat, whose ruler, the Kartid Giyath al-Din, had declared his loyalty to the Ilkhanids. The siege of Herat was unsuccessful, however, as Yasa'ur decided to withdraw upon hearing of the approach of the Ilkhanid army and withdrew into southern Afghanistan. In the following year, he was killed by Kebek, who had recently become Chagatai Khan and who deemed Yasa'ur to still be a threat.\n\nYasa'ur's personal troops eventually formed the basis of the Yasa'uri, a group that gained influence within the Chagatai \"ulus\" in the mid-fourteenth century.\n\n"}
