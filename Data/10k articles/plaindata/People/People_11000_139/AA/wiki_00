{"id": "1964606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964606", "title": "Alberto Vilar", "text": "Alberto Vilar\n\nAlberto Vilar, a.k.a. Albert Vilar, (born October 4, 1940) is an American former investment manager who became particularly known as a patron of opera companies, performing arts organizations, and educational institutions. Following the collapse of his investment firm, Amerindo Investment Advisors, he was tried and convicted in November 2008 on charges of money laundering, investment advisor fraud, securities fraud, mail and wire fraud. He was sentenced in February 2010 to nine years in prison and released in 2018.\n\nOriginally from West Orange, New Jersey, Vilar earned an economics degree from Washington & Jefferson College, a liberal arts college in Washington, Pennsylvania. He then earned a master's degree in economics at Iona College in New Rochelle, New York. In 1979, along with Gary Tanaka, he founded Amerindo Investment Advisors, an investment advisory firm based in San Francisco and New York, with offices in London. In 1981, Vilar made his first $1 million. Amerindo's main investment activities were in technology funds, which the stock market crash of 2000 severely affected. The value of the Amerindo funds declined sharply, and Vilar began to default on his pledges to arts institutions.\n\nVilar has served on the Washington & Jefferson College Board of Trustees.\n\nThe arts organisations to which Vilar pledged donations included:\n\nAs a result of his philanthropy, in 2002 the Americans for the Arts organization gave him their National Arts Award, for \"Corporate Citizenship in the Arts\".\n\nAs noted in James Stewart's 2006 \"New Yorker\" profile of Vilar, at some point in 2002, Vilar was hospitalized for a series of operations on his back, and he claims to have nearly died as the result of complications: \"they were ready to give me the last rites\". There was speculation that he might have missed some planned donations as the result of his illness.\n\nA lasting effect, however, clearly came from the severe decline in his personal fortune due to the crash in technology stocks around 2000. It is documented that Vilar still continued to make pledges even as his personal and his company's fortunes continued to plunge. Among the pledges were $5 million for money for voice loss research after meeting Julie Andrews and $30 million to a Berlin opera company: \"Asking Alberto for money was like offering an alcoholic a drink\". However, many of his pledges were never paid.\n\nVilar and Tanaka were arrested on May 26, 2005, on charges of securities fraud. The government claimed that the two appropriated as much as $5 million of an Amerindo client Lily Cates' (heiress and mother of actress Phoebe Cates) money for personal use. It was alleged that Vilar used the money to pay for some home repairs and to make good on previously-promised charitable contributions. It was also alleged that Tanaka used money to purchase thoroughbred race horses. The SEC also filed a civil suit.\n\nAccording to Stewart's article in \"The New Yorker\", an extensive analysis of Vilar's rise and fall, \"Vilar maintains that when he was arrested he was on the brink of a financial comeback. Everything I predicted about the Internet has come true... I'm ready to go back to work and make money.\" Stewart continues: \"if convicted, Vilar and Tanaka face fines of more than ten million dollars and prison terms of up to a hundred and fifty-five years. But Vilar says, 'We'll sort this out. I'll get beyond this. I will always try to help others... I still love opera and classical music... The Met is not going to get my money, but it will not kill my love of music.'\"\n\nThe charges did not allege wrongdoing at Amerindo's mutual funds, and when the firm was wound up there were no missing funds. But Morningstar, a fund analysis company, advised investors to withdraw their money in any case, because the funds had been performing very poorly. In fact, as with many other funds investing in internet companies, investors had already been pulling out for some time, reducing assets and causing expense ratios to increase. Extensive seizures of records and computers in the course of the investigation compelled Amerindo's board to merge the fund with Munder Capital Management's fund, \"Munder NetNet\", later renamed \"Munder Internet\". The seizures were ruled excessive by a federal judge in early 2007.\n\nVilar and Tanaka's trial began in September 2008, with Herald Price Fahringer as Vilar's defence attorney and Glenn Colton representing Tanaka. The trial concluded on November 19, 2008 with the conviction of Vilar on all 12 counts with which he had been charged and the conviction of Tanaka on 3 counts.\n\nOn February 5, 2010, Vilar was sentenced to nine years in prison, while Tanaka was sentenced to five years. They were both featured in the fifth season of the television series \"American Greed\". In October 2012, after having served more than 2 1/2 years at the Fort Dix, New Jersey, Federal Correctional Institution, the appeals court, over the objections of the prosecution, ordered his immediate release pending the appeal. Vilar and Tanaka were returned to jail in November 2013. In April 2014, Vilar was returned to prison, and sentenced to an additional year for preventing the victims' families from recovering their lost funds.\n\nIn a 2000 interview with Philipp Blom, Vilar had estimated his donations to opera houses and other performing arts centers in some 150 million dollars granted over the previous 10 years\n\nMany of the organizations to which Vilar had pledged donations gradually began to remove his name from parts of their institutions where it had been prominently placed.\n\nIn July 2005 the Royal Opera House announced that, following Vilar's failure to maintain the agreed payment schedule, his name would be removed from the building. Later his name was removed from the young artists program when a new donor stepped forward.\n\nAt the Metropolitan Opera, where his name appeared on the \"Vilar Grand Tier\", it has since been removed. The Washington Opera's young artists program has also been renamed (after additional support was found) as the \"Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program\", and the Kennedy Center's \"Arts Management Fellowship\" program has similarly dropped the Vilar name.\n\n\n"}

Avraham Shifrin was one of the world’s top authorities on the Soviet system of prisons and slave labor camps. Shifrin's testimonies before Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate and other congressional committee (House Banking and Currency Committee, 1973), provided the world with the major listing of Soviet slave labor camps.\n\nAvraham Shifrin was born on October 8, 1923 in Minsk, USSR (modern Belarus) into a Jewish family. His father, Isaak Shifrin, was arrested in 1937, sentenced under false charges to ten years of corrective labor in Kolyma. During World War II, Avraham Shifrin fought in Shtrafbat, Soviet penal battalion, where he was drafted as a son of the Enemy of the people (Russian language: сын врага народа, \"syn vraga naroda\"). Within days, ninety percent of his unit was dead or wounded and Shifrin had been wounded twice. Participated in the Battle of Königsberg, was awarded the Medal \"For the Capture of Königsberg\". As a lawyer, in 1949–1953, he worked for the Soviet Ministry of Defense and at the same time actively participated in the Zionist movement. In 1953 was falsely accused in spying for the US and Israel and sentenced to death. Later, the death sentence was changed to twenty five years in Gulag, five years of exile to remote regions, and five years of revoking civil rights. In 1963 Shifrin was released from prison; in 1970 repatriated to Israel. Shifrin testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1973 that American prisoners of war were being held in Soviet prison camps. According to Arnold Beizer, a Hartford lawyer, the testimony was corroborated by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1992, who said American soldiers had been transferred to Russian labor camps.\n\nAccording to Avraham Shifrin's research, massive Russian Gulag concentration camp has been found on the Russian Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean (71° North, 179° West). The camps on Wrangell were revealed in the 1982 book \"The First Guidebook to Prisons and Concentration Camps of the Soviet Union,\" by Avraham Shifrin (Bantam Books). His research institute interviewed hundreds of escapees from Soviet gulags. In his 1973 testimony before the U. S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, Shifrin described three concentration camps with thousands of prisoners, and in one camp was an atomic reactor used in radiation experiments on live prisoners. American prisoners of war may have been on Wrangell. The Russians are reputed to have taken American and other military prisoners from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War to Siberian slave labor camps. Even the famed World War II hero Raoul Wallenberg (who was declared an honorary U. S. citizen along with Winston Churchill) was seen in a camp on Wrangell Island in 1962, according to testimony of imprisoned Soviet SMERSH officer Efim Moshinskiy in Shifrin’s book\n\nAvraham Shifrin claimed that according to the investigation of his Research Centre for Prisons, Psychprisons and Forced Labor Concentration Camps of the USSR, KAL 007 landed on water north of Moneron Island, and the passengers successfully disembarked on emergency floats. The Soviets collected them and subsequently sent them to camps with the children \"separated from their parents and safely hidden in the orphan houses of one of the Soviet Middle Asian republics\". According to Michel Brun this theory is not entirely preposterous. In his book he analyses the first news, communicated by CIA and South Korean government: that KAL 007 landed in Sakalin and all passengers are safe. In his careful searches, he discovered the source of this first information. It was published in a Japanese newspaper: \"Mainichi Shinboun\" September 1, 1983. According to him, this observation came from Wakkanai radars. So, he considers that another aircraft, probably military, landed at Sakhalin during the \"Sakhalin battle\" and that its passengers, American and/or South Korean, were jailed in the Soviet Union.\n\nAvraham Shifrin was married to the Israeli politician Eleonora Shifrin.\n\n\n"}

They follow him to a quarry, where Cain sends his car over a cliff (with Tom and Sadie supposedly inside). While the police search the lake, Cain disguises himself as an officer. After shooting Sadie, Cain forces Tom to get Chastity to deliver the ransom. Debbie begs Cain to let her go with him and they part in tears. Cain gives some of the ransom money to an old woman, asking her to post it to Debbie. Surprised by the woman's honesty, Cain realises he wants to change. At the airport, he gets on a plane and leaves Sadie behind, telling her that he does not want to continue as he was. He leaves Debbie a message that he has left Sadie, asking her to ignore what others say and telling her that he loves her more than he shows.

When Maisie learns what her mother and brother did, she calls the police and tells them that her mother killed her father.\n\nIn April 2011, Charity ends her relationship with Cain again after he has a one-night stand with Faye and sleeps with Amy Wyatt (Chelsea Halfpenny).

Kyle eventually comes out, and Cain rescues him, just before the entire village hall collapses.\n\nIn February 2016, Cain was the third person to learn that Aaron was raped by his father, Gordon Livesy (Gary Mavers) when he was a child. The first was Aaron's ex-lover Robert Sugden (Ryan Hawley), 2 weeks later, Chas was the second person after Aaron told her. After Chas told him about Aaron's abuse, Cain drove to Gordon's house when he plans a revenge on Gordon for what he did to Aaron. The next day, Cain goes to Gordon's house and punches Gordon when he returns. Cain ties him up and forces Gordon to drink vodka and take Chas' sleeping pills to make it look like he was trying to take his own life. Gordon riles Cain up so much that he picks up a chair intending to beat Gordon with it, but Aaron and Chas arrive in the nick of time to stop him. Aaron informs Cain that he wants to deal with this his way by calling the police on his father. As Aaron is giving his statement, Cain, instructed by Chas, has told the rest of the Dingles, Moira, Paddy and Adam about Aaron. When he is being questioned, Gordon tells the police that Cain tried to make him take his own life. The police arrive at Butlers to question Cain, but Chas and Moira give him an alibi.\n\nDespite Cain's newfound role as protector of the Dingle name, due to Zak's excommunication, Chas criticizes him, citing that he hasn't bothered even glancing at Aaron since finding out he was abused, and is ashamed of him. Cain tells her that this is utter rubbish, and that he still loves Aaron, the problem being that whenever he looks at him, it reminds him \"of what a sick, perverted man Gordon is\". Alongside this newfound fatherly duty, Cain also tries to protect Debbie from long term lover (and Moria's nephew) Ross after she leaves the village and he will stop at no lengths to get in contact with her. Cain also supports Lisa as she celebrates turning 60 by divorcing Zak. However, Cain later tries being civil with his estranged father due to his troubles with Chas. Cain was in the pub when Chas accidentally reveals to everybody in the pub that Gordon abused Aaron when he was a child. After the police tell Aaron that they can't get Sandra to back Aaron up, Cain goes to the scrapyard and finds Aaron taking his frustrations out on a car.

Later, Chas went to the garage and asks Cain if he was involved of Gordon's death, Cain says no but he believe Robert could be involved. Cain and Chas went to the pub and told Aaron that they believe Robert could have had Gordon killed by paying somebody to do it but later, reveals on the next day that Gordon took his life by hanging himself.\n\nIn July 2016, After Holly relapses and becomes addicted to drugs again Moira confronts her drug dealer but falls onto a used needle causing her to believe she has contracted HIV. With Moira's help Holly becomes clean, however Cain is disgusted when he finds out Holly caused Moira to become contracted with HIV after he finds Moira's tablets.

The day after that Cain said that was another on-off Charity quoted 'You'll be sending me dirty Emojis before they days out' they had sex again in a car but Holly Barton knocked on the garage door they got rid of Holly,after fetching him and Charity drinks she joked 'Same time tomorrow?'.\n\nIn February 2017, Cain was shocked when his mother Faith returns to the village and help Robert and Aaron's family for his nephew and Robert's wedding, but turns bad news when his mother was accused for the murder of her husband.\n\nIn October 2018, after Joe Tate (Ned Porteous) leaves Debbie at the alter on their wedding day, Cain threatens to kill Joe if he ever shows his face again around the village and goes up to Home Farm to search for answers but see's Joe walking back into the grounds after deciding against Graham's wishes to stay away. Cain punches Joe to the ground as he goes down he hits his head on a rock and kills Joe\n\nIn 2000, series producer Kieran Roberts introduced three new members of the Dingle family. The new characters made their first appearance at the funeral of Butch Dingle (Paul Loughran). Among them were Cain (Jeff Hordley), son of Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) and Faith Dingle (Gillian Jephcott). Cain's cousin/one-time lover is Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins), and Zak's brother is Shadrach (Andy Devine). In April 2006, it was announced that Jeff Hordley had quit, however the door was left open for a possible return in the future. In January 2009, it was announced that the character would be brought back in April that year after a three-year break. Speaking to Digital Spy about his return, Hordley said \"I am really looking forward to returning to Emmerdale. The storylines that led to Cain's return are in keeping with his character and a perfect way to bring him back to the heart of the Dingle clan where he belongs\". Hordley later said that he initially turned down a return but when he was approached on the matter he approved of the storyline and felt like \"the time was right for me\".\n\nThe character was labelled a \"ruthless hard man\", a \"bad boy\" and a \"villain\" by \"Digital Spy\". Itv.com also described Cain as the \"village pariah\" and commented that he likes \"being in charge\" but dislikes \"being made a fool of\". What's on TV described him saying \"a villain through and through, Cain Dingle will even cross his own family if it's worth his while!\" Cain has also been described as the \"village's unmistakable bad boy\". When casting a new family for the serial one character specification described Cain's earlier tenure, saying: \"much in the early Cain Dingle mould, ruthless, unscrupulous, and extremely promiscuous\". Hordley said Debbie is Cain's Achilles' heel who he would \"move mountains for\" while \"women are his other Achilles heel, but he won't move mountains for them\".\n\nUpon Cain's return to the village he and Charity reunite. Charity proposes on Christmas Day to which Cain accepts. Even though they're family. Hordley explained that the couple can't see they are made for each other as they are \"so busy competing and getting one up on each other\" which means that they fail to see that they are \"the same\". Atkins said Charity asked Cain to marry her to \"prove a point\". On a storyline in which Cain and Charity plan to carry out a scam Atkins said it would make the audience question \"will they/won't they pull it off\" before adding that it is a \"Bonnie and Clyde storyline but without the deaths!\" Hordley said he and Atkins \"spark off and bounce off\" each other which Hordley added made it \"easier for me to act with her\". Atkins added that she felt \"having a good rapport in that way both on and off screen is vital\". Digital Spy described the relationship as \"volatile\".\n\nHordley said Cain's return is his way of \"coming back unannounced\", and added, \"Cain's style is to surprise people, but there has been involvement in the storyline as he was the one to get Debbie released from prison\". Hordley felt that upon Cain's return \"everyone's moved on\". He added that Cain \"looks down on\" Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), and that Aaron is \"like a little puppy looking up to Cain, thinking that his uncle's the bee's knees\". He also stated, \"There's a great relationship going to build there. Aaron stands for everything Cain was – he's a younger version of him and Cain recognises that. There's definitely lots of undiscovered territory there\". On Cain and Chas's relationship Hordley also felt that it \"hasn't really been explored\"; even though they have been in the serial a long time together the relationship is still \"non-existent\". This left \"so much scope\" and \"with Aaron being involved, too. There certainly should be more involvement and I'm hopeful there will be\". On Cain's relationship with Debbie, Hordley said the relationship was \"true to the character's roots\". He added that Cain will \"do whatever it takes to look after that girl. If there's one Achilles heel of Cain, it's his daughter. It's his weakness and he'll move mountains for her\". Hordley also felt that Cain's relationship with Charity was \"going to be a big thing\" and that he expected there would be \"a lot of stuff between Charity, Debbie and Cain\".\n\nIn 2011, it was announced that Cain would become part of a \"major\" storyline where he is attacked by a \"mystery\" assailant in a \"whodunit\"-style storyline. The storyline developed after Cain had made several enemies throughout the year and forced one of his enemies to \"take the ultimate revenge\". Producers stylised the plot as a \"whodunit storyline\" which would keep viewers guessing as to whom the attacker was. The potential suspects were revealed to be John Barton (James Thornton), Moira Barton (Natalie J Robb), Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson), Amy Wyatt (Chelsea Halfpenny), Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) and Charity Tate (Emma Atkins). A spokesperson for the serial stated that the characters had become \"sworn enemies\" of Cain, all \"pushed to the limit after months of manipulation and destruction\". \"Emmerdale's\" executive producer Stuart Blackburn said that the climax of Cain's actions \"will be one of our most dramatic episodes this year\" as viewers decide who took \"matters into their own hands\". The attacker was revealed to be Zak Dingle, Cain's father.\n\nAt the 2002 British Soap Awards Hordley was nominated for \"Sexiest Male\" and \"Villain of the Year\". At the 2007 British Soap Awards Hordley was nominated for \"Sexiest Male\", \"Villain of the Year\" and \"Best Exit\". At the 2009 Inside Soap Awards Hordley was nominated for \"Best Bad Boy\" while Cain's and Debbie's custody battle for Sarah was nominated for \"Best Storyline\". At the 2010 British Soap Awards Hordley was nominated for \"Sexiest Male\" and \"Villain of the Year\". For his portrayal of Cain, Hordley was nominated in the category of \"Villain of the Year\" at the 2011 Inside Soap Awards. Hordley was nominated in the category of \"Serial Drama Performance\" at the 2012 National Television Awards, for his portrayal of Cain. In a poll to find the \"most kissable soap stud\" run by dating agency Dating Direct, Hordley came 6th with 1% of the vote. Hordley was nominated for \"Best Villain\" at the 2012 All About Soap Awards, while the \"Who Attacked Cain?\" storyline was voted \"Best Mystery\" by readers. The character was selected as one of the \"top 100 British soap characters\" by industry experts for a poll to be run by \"What's on TV\", with readers able to vote for their favourite character to discover \"Who is Soap's greatest Legend?\" Digital Spy reported that Hordley received a mainly positive reaction for his role. Tom Lister who plays Carl King said Cain is a \"great character\" adding that it was a \"coup to get Jeff back\". Lucy Pargeter who plays Chas said commented on Hordley's return saying \"I really hope that they get us together and give us a storyline which highlights the strength between them\" before adding that Hordley is \"amazing and everyone's so excited that he's coming back\".\n\n"}

Greider\n\nCarolyn Widney \"Carol\" Greider (born April 15, 1961) is an American molecular biologist. She is a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor, Daniel Nathans Professor, and Director of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins University. She discovered the enzyme telomerase in 1984, while she was a graduate student of Elizabeth Blackburn at the University of California, Berkeley. Greider pioneered research on the structure of telomeres, the ends of the chromosomes. She was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, along with Blackburn and Jack W. Szostak, for their discovery that telomeres are protected from progressive shortening by the enzyme telomerase.\n\nGreider was born in San Diego, California. Her father, Kenneth Greider, was a physics professor. Her family moved from San Diego to Davis, California, where she spent many of her early years and graduated from Davis Senior High School in 1979. She graduated from the College of Creative Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a B.A. in biology in 1983. During this time she also studied at the University of Göttingen and made significant discoveries there.\n\nGreider is dyslexic and states that her \"compensatory skills also played a role in my success as a scientist because one has to intuit many different things that are going on at the same time and apply those to a particular problem\" Greider initially suspected her dyslexia after seeing patterns of common mistakes such as backwards words when she received back graded work in the first grade. Greider started to memorize words and their spellings rather than attempting to sound out the spelling of words. Greider has worked significantly to overcome her dyslexia to become successful in her professional life, and credits her dyslexia as helping her appreciate differences and making unusual decisions such as the one to work with Tetrahymena, an unusual organism.\n\nGreider initially had difficulty getting in to graduate school due to low GRE scores as a result of her dyslexia. U.C. Berkeley’s graduate school admission office was able to focus on Greider’s impressive experience and credentials and accepted her. Greider applied to thirteen grad schools and was only accepted to two, Caltech and U.C. Berkeley. She chose the University of California, Berkeley where she would be able to work with Elizabeth Blackburn and the two made their telomerase discovery.\n\nShe completed her Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1987 at the University of California, Berkeley, under Elizabeth Blackburn. While at UC Berkeley, Greider co-discovered telomerase, a key enzyme in cancer and anemia research, along with Blackburn.\n\nGreider joined Blackburn's laboratory in April 1984 looking for the enzyme that was hypothesized to add extra DNA bases to the ends of chromosomes. Without the extra bases, which are added as repeats of a six base pair motif, chromosomes are shortened during DNA replication, eventually resulting in chromosome deterioration and senescence or cancer-causing chromosome fusion. Blackburn and Greider looked for the enzyme in the model organism \"Tetrahymena thermophila\", a fresh-water protozoan with a large number of telomeres.\n\nOn December 25, 1984, Greider first obtained results indicating that a particular enzyme was likely responsible. After six months of additional research Greider and Blackburn concluded that it was the enzyme responsible for telomere addition. They published their findings in the journal \"Cell\" in December, 1985. The enzyme, originally called \"telomere terminal transferase,\" is now known as telomerase. Telomerase rebuilds the tips of chromosomes and determines the life span of cells.\n\nGreider's additional research to confirm her discovery was largely focused in identifying the mechanism that telomerase uses for elongation. Greider chose to use RNA degrading enzymes and saw that the telomeres stopped extending, which was an indication that RNA was involved in the enzyme. Greider also used telomerase deficient mice and saw that her sixth generation of mice had become entirely sterile, she mated them with control mice and the telomerase deficient mice were able to regenerate their telomeres.\n\nGreider then completed her postdoctoral work, and also held a faculty position, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Long Island, New York. During this time, Greider, in collaboration with Ronald A. DePinho, produced the first telomerase knockout mouse, showing that although telomerase is dispensable for life, increasingly short telomeres result in various deleterious phenotypes, colloquially referred to as premature aging. In the mid-1990s, Greider was recruited by Michael D. West, founder of biotechnology company Geron (now CEO of BioTime) to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board.\n\nGreider, Blackburn and Jack Szostak, Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School, shared the 2006 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their work on telomeres.\n\nIn February 2014, Greider was named a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nGreider currently serves as director of and professor at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Greider was first promoted to Daniel Nathans Professor at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in 2004. Greider's lab employs both student and post-doctoral trainees in order to further examine the relationships between the biology of telomeres and their connection to disease. Greider's lab uses a variety of tools including yeast, mice, and biochemistry in order to look at progressive telomere shortening. Greider's lab is also researching how tumor reformation can be controlled by the presence of short telomeres. The lab's future work will focus more on identifying the processing and regulation of telomeres and telomere elongation.\n\nGreider married Nathaniel C. Comfort, a fellow academic, in 1992. She has two children. Greider is divorced. Before Greider's children were born, she competed in triathlons. She still bikes, runs, and swims for fitness.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one use of a deed poll.\n\nSome organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without documentation, such as a deed or statutory declaration. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change according to common law.\n\nIn England and Wales, such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the High Court. Deeds so registered are advertised in the \"London Gazette\". A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the Senior Master on behalf of the Master of the Rolls who will take into account the child's best interests. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it.\n\nRegistration of deeds is regulated by the \"Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994\", SI 1994/604 (as amended)\n. Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice.\n\nRegistration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a witness, carries sufficient legal authority to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name.\n\nThe procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England and Wales.\nIn England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity. In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office. However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a deed poll of change of name () is obtainable from the Central Office of the Four Courts, Dublin at a cost of €30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician Seán Loftus, who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers.\n\nIn \"re Parrott, Cox v Parrott\" [1946] Ch 183, Mr Justice Vaisey stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's Christian name (first name) – that could be done by only an Act of Parliament. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed \"Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in \"re Parrott, Cox v Parrott\", the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed\".\n\n"}

His \"Sefer Hazikkuk\", the Hebrew equivalent of \"Index Expurgatorius\", played an important role in the censorship of Hebrew books in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.\n\nGerosolimitano was born in Safed in Ottoman Palestine in about 1550, and died in Italy in about 1620. He was educated at the rabbinical college in his native city, studying not only Talmud, but also medicine. After having been granted the degree of doctor and the title of \"Rab\", he lectured on Talmudic law in Safed. His fame as a physician spread far and wide, and finally reached the ears of the Sultan Murad III, who summoned him to Constantinople as court physician.\n\nYerushalmi subsequently became a convert to Christianity; he went to Rome, and was received at the College of the Neophytes, where he taught Hebrew. During the most active period of the expurgation of Hebrew books under the Inquisition in Italy Dominico's services were in great demand; and first in Venice (1578-92?), later as chief reviser of the censorship commission in Mantua (1595–97), he had opportunity for placing his signature in more books and manuscripts than any other of the Italian expurgators. His activity in this direction continued at intervals—in places, however, not yet identified—almost until his death.\n\nDominico's works included, according to his own statement, \"Ma'ayan Gannim\" (\"Fountain of the Gardens\"), on the fundamental principles of the Christian faith. He also translated into Hebrew the whole of the New Testament, and most of the Apocryphal books (1615–17). He was the compiler of the \"Sefer ha-Ziḳḳuḳ\" (\"Book of Expurgation\"), still in manuscript, one copy of which (in the library of Cardinal Berberini, now part of the Vatican Library in Rome) shows revision by him as late as 1619.\n\nThe record of Dominico's conversion has been discovered, dated 6 August 1593 in Venice. The seventeenth century authors Giulio Bartolocci and Johann Christoph Wolf state that Nicolaus Mursius in his \"Relatione della Città di Constantinopoli\" (Bologna, 1671) mentions as court physician of the Turkish sultan a Jew who later became converted under the name of \"Dominico Ierosolymitano\". Wolf holds that he is identical with the subject of this article; Bartolocci, on the other hand, states that Mursius speaks of one whom he (Mursius) had himself seen in his travels, and who was still living as a Christian in Constantinople in direst poverty, though as a Jew he had held, under the name of Pelaso, third place among the sultan's physicians.\n\n"}

{"id": "166325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166325", "title": "Dungan people", "text": "Dungan people\n\nDungan (, \"Xuejzw\" ], Xiao'erjing: ; ; Xiao'erjing: ; , \"Dungane\"; , \"Dunğandar\", دۇنغاندار; , \"Du'n'gender\", دٷڭگەندەر) is a term used in territories of the former Soviet Union to refer to a group of Muslim people of Chinese origin. Turkic-speaking peoples in Xinjiang Province in northwestern China also refer to members of this ethnic group as Dungans. In both China and the former Soviet republics where they reside, however, members of this ethnic group call themselves Hui because Dungans are descendants of Hui that came to Central Asia.\n\nIn the censuses of the now independent states of the former Soviet Union, the Dungans, who are enumerated separately from Chinese, can be found in Kazakhstan (36,900 according to the 1999 census), Kyrgyzstan (58,409 according to the 2009 census), and Russia (801 according to the 2002 census).\n\nIn the Ferghana Valley, the first Dungans to appear in Central Asia originated from Kuldja and Kashgar, as slaves captured by raiders; they mostly served in private wealthy households. After the Russians conquered Central Asia in the late 19th century and abolished slavery, most female Dungan slaves remained where they had originally been held captive. Russian ethnographer Validimir Petrovich Nalivkin and his wife said that \"women slaves almost all remained in place, because they either were married to workers and servants of their former owners, or they were too young to begin an independent life\". Dungan women slaves were of low status and not regarded highly in Bukhara.\n\nTurkic Muslim slave-raiders from Khoqand did not distinguish between Hui Muslim and Han Chinese, enslaving Hui Muslims in violation of Islam. During the Afaqi Khoja revolts Turkic Muslim Khoja Jahangir Khoja led an invasion of Kashgar from the Kokand Khanate, and Jahangir's forces captured several hundred Dungan Chinese Muslims (tungan or hui) who were taken to Kokand. Tajiks bought two Chinese slaves from Shaanxi; they were enslaved for a year before being returned by the Tajik Beg Ku-bu-te to China. All Dungans captured, both merchants and the 300 soldiers Janhangir captured in Kashgar, had their queues cut off when brought to Kokand and Central Asia as prisoners. It was reported that many of the captives became slaves. Accounts of these slaves in Central Asia increased. The queues were removed from Dungan Chinese Muslim prisoners and then sold or given away. Some of them escaped to Russian territory where they were repatriated back to China, and the accounts of their captures were recorded in Chinese records. The Russians record an incident where they rescued these Chinese Muslim merchants who escaped, after they were sold by Jahangir's Army in Central Asia, and sent them back to China.\n\nThe Dungan in the former Soviet republics are Hui who fled China in the aftermath of the Hui Minorities' War in the 19th century. According to Rimsky-Korsakoff (1992), three separate groups of the Hui people fled to the Russian Empire across the Tian Shan Mountains during the exceptionally severe winter of 1877/78:\n\nThe next wave of immigration followed in the early 1880s. In accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), which required the withdrawal of the Russian troops from the Upper Ili Basin (the Kulja area), the Dungan (Hui) and Taranchi (Uyghur) people of the region were allowed to opt for moving to the Russian side of the border. Many chose that option; according to Russian statistics, 4,682 Hui moved to the Russian Empire under the treaty. They migrated in many small groups between 1881 and 1883, settling in the village of Sokuluk some 30 km west of Bishkek, as well as in a number of locations between the Chinese border and Sokuluk, in southeastern Kazakhstan and in northern Kyrgyzstan.\n\nIn the Russian Empire, Soviet Union, and the post-Soviet states, the Dungans continue to refer to themselves as the \"Hui people\" (, Huízú; in Cyrillic Soviet Dungan spelling, xуэйзў).\n\nThe name \"Dungan\" is of obscure origin. One popular theory derives this word from Turkic \"döñän\" (\"one who turns\"), which can be compared to Chinese 回 (huí), which has a similar meaning. Another theory derives it from the Chinese 东甘 (Dong Gan), 'Eastern Gansu', the region to which many of the Dungan can trace their ancestry; however the character \"gan\" (干) used in the name of the ethnic group is different from that used in the name of the province (甘).\n\nThe term \"Dungan\" (\"Tonggan\", \"Donggan\") has been used by Central Asian Turkic-and Tajik-speaking people to refer to Chinese-speaking Muslims for several centuries. Joseph Fletcher cites Turkic and Persian manuscripts related to the preaching of the 17th century Kashgarian Sufi master Muhammad Yūsuf (or, possibly, his son Afaq Khoja) inside the Ming Empire (in today's Gansu and/or Qinghai), where the Kashgarian preacher is told to have converted \"'ulamā-yi Tunganiyyān\" (i.e., \"Dungan ulema\") into Sufism.\n\nPresumably, it was from the Turkic languages that the term was borrowed into Russian (дунгане, \"dungane\" (pl.); дунганин, \"dunganin\" (sing.)) and Chinese (), as well as to Western European languages.\nIn English and German, the ethnonym \"Dungan\", in various spelling forms, was attested as early as the 1830s, sometimes typically referring to the Hui people of Xinjiang. For example, James Prinsep in 1835 mentions Muslim \"Túngánis\" in \"Chinese Tartary\". In 1839, Karl Ernst von Baer in his German-language account of Russian Empire and adjacent Asian lands has a one-page account of Chinese-speaking Muslim \"Dungani\" or \"Tungani\", who had visited Orenburg in 1827 with a caravan from China; he also mentions \"Tugean\" as a spelling variant used by other authors. R.M. Martin in 1847 mentions \"Tungani\" merchants in Yarkand.\n\nThe word (mostly in the form \"Dungani\" or \"Tungani\", sometimes \"Dungens\" or \"Dungans\") acquired some currency in English and other western languages when a number of books in the 1860-1870s discussed the Dungan Rebellion in Northwestern China. At the time, one could see European and American authors apply the term \"Tungani\" to the Hui people both in Xinjiang,\nand in Shaanxi and Gansu (which at the time included today's Ningxia and Qinghai as well). Authors aware of the general picture of the spread of Islam in China, viewed these \"Tungani\" as just one of the groups of China's Muslims.\n\nMarshall Broomhall, who has a chapter on \"the Tungan Rebellion\" in his 1910 book, introduces \"the name Tungan or Dungan, by which the Muslims of these parts [i.e., NE China] are designated, in contradistinction as the Chinese Buddhists who are spoken of as Kithay\";\nthe reference to \"Khitay\" shows that he was viewing the two terms as used by Turkic speakers.\nBroomhall's book also contains a translation of the report on Chinese Muslims by the Ottoman writer named Abd-ul-Aziz. Abd-ul-Aziz divides the \"Tungan people\" into two branches: \"the Tunagans of China proper\" (including, apparently all Hui people in \"China proper\", as he also talks e.g. about the Tungans having 17 mosques in Beijing), and \"The Tungans of Chinese and Russian Turkestan\", who still look and speak Chinese, but have often also learned the \"Turkish\" language.\n\nLater authors continued to use the term Dungan (in various transcriptions) for, specifically, the Hui people of Xinjiang.\nFor example, Owen Lattimore, writing c. 1940, maintains the terminological distinction between these two related groups: \"T'ungkan\" (i.e. Wade-Giles for \"Dungan\"), described by him as the descendants of the Gansu Hui people resettled in Xinjiang in 17-18th centuries, vs. e.g. \"Gansu Moslems\" or generic \"Chinese Moslems\". The term (usually as \"Tungans\") continues to be used by many modern historians writing about the 19th century Dungan Rebellion (e.g., by Denis C. Twitchett in The Cambridge History of China, by James A. Millward in his economic history of the region,\nor by Kim Ho-dong in his monograph).\n\nThe Dungans themselves referred to Karakunuz (, sometimes Караконыз or Караконуз) as Ingpan (, Yingpan; ), which means 'a camp, an encampment'. In 1965, Karakunuz was renamed Masanchi (sometimes spelt as \"Masanchin\"), after Magaza Masanchi or Masanchin (Dungan: Магәзы Масанчын; ), a Dungan participant in the Communist Revolution and a Soviet Kazakhstan statesman.\n\nThe following table summarizes location of Dungan villages in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, alternative names used for them, and their Dungan population as reported by Ma Tong (2003). The Cyrillic Dungan spelling of place names is as in the textbook by Sushanlo, Imazov (1988); the spelling of the name in Chinese character is as in Ma Tong (2003).\nThe position of the Kazakhstan villages within the administrative division of Jambyl Region, and the total population of each village can be found at the provincial statistics office web site.\n\nBesides the traditionally Dungan villages, many Dungan people live in the nearby cities, such as Bishkek, Tokmok, Karakol.\n\nDuring World War II, some Dungans served in the Red Army, one of them who was Vanakhun Mansuza (Cyrillic Dungan : мансуза ванахун; ) a Dungan war \"hero\" who led a \"mortar battery\".\n\nAs Ding (2005) notes, \"[t]he Dungan people derive from China's Hui people, and now live mainly in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Their population is about 110,000. This people have now developed a separate ethnicity outside China, yet they have close relations with the Hui people in culture, ethnic characteristics and ethnic identity.\"\n\nThe Dungan language, which the Dungan people call the \"Hui language\" (Хуэйзў йүян or \"Huejzw jyian\"), is similar to the Zhongyuan dialect of Mandarin Chinese, which is widely spoken in the south of Gansu and the west of Guanzhong in Shaanxi in China.\n\nLike other varieties of Chinese, Dungan is tonal. There are two main dialects, one with four tones, and the other, considered standard, with three tones in the final position in words and four tones in the non-final position.\n\nSome Dungan vocabulary may sound old-fashioned to Chinese people. For example, they refer to a President as an \"Emperor\" (Хуаңды，\"huan'g-di\") and call government offices \"yamen\" (ямын，\"ya-min\"), a term for mandarins' offices in ancient China. Their language also contains many loanwords from Arabic, Persian, and Turkic. Since the 1940s, the language has been written in Cyrillic script, demonstrating that Chinese can be written with an alphabet (compare the pinyin system).\n\nUnlike other minority nationalities in Central Asia, such as the local Koreans, most Dungan people are trilingual. More than two-thirds of the Dungan also speak Russian, and a small proportion can speak Kyrgyz or other languages belonging to the titular nationalities of the countries where they live.\n\nNineteenth century explorer Henry Lansdell noted that the Dungan people abstained from spirits and opium, neither smoked nor took snuff and\n\"are of middle height, and inclined to be stout. They have high and prominent foreheads, thick and arched eyebrows, eyes rather sunken, fairly prominent cheek-bones, face oval, mouth of average size, lips thick, teeth normal, chin round, ears small and compressed, hair black and smooth, beard scanty and rough, skin smooth, neck strong, and extremities of average proportions. The characteristics of the Dungans are kindness, industry, and hospitality.\nThey engage in husbandry, horticulture, and trade. In domestic life parental authority is very strong. After the birth of a child the mother does not get up for fifteen days, and, without any particular feast, the child receives its name in the presence of a mullah the day succeeding\nthat of its birth. Circumcision takes place on the eighth, ninth, or tenth day. When a girl is married she receives a dower. In sickness they have recourse to medicine and doctors, but never to exorcisms. \nAfter a death the mullah and the aged assemble to recite prayers ; the corpse is wrapped in white linen and then buried, but never burned. On returning from the interment the mullah and the elders partake of bread and meat. To saints they erect monuments like little mosques, for others simple hillocks. The widow may re-marry after 90 days, and on the third anniversary of the death a feast takes place.\"\n\nThe Dungan are primarily farmers, growing rice and vegetables such as sugar beets. Many also raise dairy cattle. In addition, some are involved in opium production. The Dungan tend to be endogamous.\n\nThe Dungan are well known for their hospitality and hold many ceremonies and banquets to preserve their culture. They have elaborate and colorful observances of birthdays, weddings, and funerals. In addition, schools have museums to preserve other parts of their culture, such as embroidery, traditional clothing, silver jewelry, paper cuts of animals and flowers and tools.\n\nThe Dungan still practice elements of Chinese culture, in cuisine and attire, up to 1948 they also practiced foot binding. The conservative Shaanxi Dungan cling more tightly to Chinese customs than the Gansu Dungan.\n\nThe Dungans have retained Chinese traditions which have disappeared in modern China. Traditional marriage practices are still widespread with matchmakers, the marriages conducted by the Dungan are similar to Chinese marriages in the 19th century, hairstyles worn by women and attire date back to the Qing dynasty.\n\nShaanxi female attire is still Chinese, though the rest of the Dungans dress in western attire. Chopsticks are used by Dungans. The cuisine of the Dungan resembles northwestern Chinese cuisine.\n\nAround the late 19th century the Bride Price was between 240 and 400 rubles for Dungan women. Dungans take other women such as Kirghiz and Tatars as brides willingly, or kidnap Kirghiz girls.\n\nShaanxi Dungans are even conservative when marrying with other Dungans, they want only other Shaanxi Dungans marrying their daughters, while their sons are allowed to marry Gansu Dungan, Kirghiz, and Kazakh women.\n\nAs recently as 1962, inter-ethnic marriage was reported to be anathema among Dungans.\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the term Zhongyuanren () was synonymous with being mainstream Chinese, especially referring to Han Chinese and Hui Muslims in Xinjiang or Central Asia.\n\nFor religious reasons, while Hui people do not consider themselves Han and are not Han-Chinese, they consider themselves part of the wider Chinese race and refer to themselves as Zhongyuanren. The Dungan people, descendants of Hui who fled to Central Asia, called themselves Zhongyuanren in addition to the standard labels Lao Huihui and Huizi. Zhongyuanren was used generally by Turkic Muslims to refer to Han and Hui Chinese people. When Central Asian invaders from Kokand invaded Kashgar, in a letter the Kokandi commander criticizes the Kashgari Turkic Muslim Ishaq for allegedly not behaving like a Turkic-origin Muslim and wanting to be a Zhongyuanren .\n\n\n\n"}

It was established on 18 January 1908 by Richard Gerald Anthonisz.\n\nOn 12 November 1907 Richard Anthonisz organised a preliminary meeting of men and women of the Dutch Burgher community at the Lindsay School Hall in Bambalapitiya to consider the establishment of a Dutch Burgher Union. A small committee was appointed to draft a constitution for the union. The inaugural general meeting of the union was held on 18 January 1908 at the Pettah Public Library, with 267 enrolled members present. At the meeting Frederick Charles Loos, a Proctor and Member of the Legislative Council was elected as the first president of the union, with Anthonisz as Honorary Secretary (a position he retained until 1915). The second president of the union was Henry Lorenz Wendt who, however, died two months after his election and in 1912 was replaced by Fedrick Henry de Vos. In 1913 Sir Hector William van Cuylenburg was elected as the fourth president of the union. In 1916, Anthonisz was elected President, a position he held for twenty-four years until his death in 1930.\n\nThe first writ described the vision of union, and it stated \".. promote the moral, intellectual and social well-being of the Dutch and Dutch Burgher descendants in Ceylon (Sri Lanka).. and among many others .. the promotion of fellowship, self-help, self-reliance and thrift.\" Membership of the Dutcher Burgher Union was governed by strict genealogical qualifications, with members having to demonstrate an uninterrupted line of patrilineal descent from a European employee of the Dutch East India Company. \n\nInitially, the union sublet two rooms at Sea View, Kollupitiya; the union soon set about raising funds to establish a more permanent accommodation. In 1913, the union acquired land in Cinnamon Gardens on Buller's Road (now Bauddhaloka Mawatha) and Serpentine Road, where it constructed a two-storey building. The ground floor of the building contains a vestibule which leads to a large public room, with a sprung teak floor, which was used for lectures and dances. A carved wooden staircase leads to the upper floor, which houses a billiard room, bar, card rooms, a drawing room and a reading room. There is also a wing containing residential quarters for outstation members and space at the rear of the building which was initially used for horses and carriages and subsequently for car parking. The grounds also contained tennis courts and a netball court. As the suburb developed, the union was forced to sell much of its grounds for new roads and to pay for increasing property rates.\n\nThe Dutch Burgher Union still operates in Colombo as a centre for social and community activities. It has been described as a \"once a powerful secret society but now only a gloomy billiard hall near Buller Road, draped in dust and cobwebs\".\n\nThe union manages St Nikolaas' Home (a care home for elderly women of the Burgher community), and the Brohier Memorial Home (for elder men).\n\nThe union has published in excess of 70 volumes of \"The Journal of the Dutch Burgher Union of Ceylon\". The first copy was issued on 31 March 1908 and copies were issued regularly until 1968. No volumes were published between 1968 and 1981, mostly due to the exodus of members of the burgher community from Sri Lanka. The journal is now published annually. The journals contain genealogies of over 200 burgher families and played a significant role on pre-migration in the 1950s. The journals are considered as good resource for researching the community.\n\nThe DBU's centenary (1908–2008) was featured on the Sri Lankan 5 rupee stamp.\n\n\n"}

He earned himself the nickname of being the 'godfather of godfathers'.\n\nDündar Kılıç was born in 1935 in a village of the Surmene District of Trabzon in the eastern Black Sea Region, Turkey. He moved to Ankara with his family when he was nine years old, and got his first gun a year later. His first arrest was at the age of 14, by the 1960s he was already known as one of Ankara's leading criminals. His primary income came from extortion and illegal gambling, and he became known as the 'good godfather', allegedly because he would only have his people collect money from those already involved in illegal deals. Eventually the authorities caught up with him and he was arrested and jailed for a murder he committed in 1960.\n\nKılıç was released from prison in 1965. Upon his release, he soon set up various 'offices' around Istanbul that were to be used as part of an illegal check and bond trading operation. During this period he received financial help from Kurtoglu family. \n\nAfter this, Kılıç's run-ins with the law only increased. He was alleged to be involved in at least three murders, narcotics and weapons smuggling and was interrogated by police hundreds of times. Despite going away to prison for long periods, he would easily control his operations from behind bars and his absence was barely felt. Working for Kilic became a sign of prestige in the underworld. He, supposedly got some help from \"Derin\" Devlet\", a phrase used among Turkish for an unknown unit in the state which conducts covert operations. \n\nKılıç was arrested as part of a large scale joint operation against organized crime by Turkey's National Intelligence Organization (MIT) and local police in 1984. Initially arrested on 11 different charges, Kılıç was taken to a prison in Ankara's Mamak.\n\nKılıç's daughter, Uğur Kılıç, was shot dead in January 1995 by a gunman sent by her ex-husband, another mob boss named Alaattin Çakıcı. Kılıç retreated into his summer house and went into deep mourning. It is still unknown why this did not lead to a full-scale gang war between Kılıç and Çakıcı, and it is rumored that it was in fact an honour killing jointly ordered by Kılıç and Çakıcı, and this is why he did not take steps to avenge his daughter. Uğur had allegedly betrayed Çakıcı while the two were still married, and Kılıç would not stand for this.\n\nKılıç was known to have used some of his ill-gotten gains on charity work. He had financed the education of over 10,000 students and provided poor neighborhoods with food, drinks and coal during the winter. But he refrained to speak about this side of him in interviews, preferring only to say \"Of course, we help certain people\".\n\nKılıç died on 10 August 1999 in the American Hospital in Istanbul at the age of 64. Prior to his death, he was already battling eye cancer, heart and lung problems. Dündar Kılıç was interred in Zincirlikuyu Cemetery in Istanbul.\n"}

She appeared onstage as Marie Wilton until after her marriage in December 1867 to Squire Bancroft, when she adopted his last name. Bancroft and her husband were important in the development of Victorian era theatre through their presentation of innovative plays at the London theatres that they managed, first the Prince of Wales's Theatre and later the Haymarket Theatre.\n\nBancroft was born at Doncaster, and as a child appeared on the stage with her parents, who were both actors. Among her early parts was that of Fleance in \"Macbeth\" (1846). She made her London début on 15 September 1856, at the Lyceum Theatre, as the boy Henri in \"Belphegor\", playing the same night in \"Perdita; or, the Royal Milkmaid\". She won great popularity in several boy roles, in burlesques at various theatres, as Cupid in two different plays, and notably as Pippo, in \"The Maid and the Magpie\", by H. J. Byron, at the Royal Strand Theatre (1858). For several years she remained at the Strand, taking numerous parts of the same general type.\n\nIn April 1865, she began, in partnership with Henry Byron, the management of the Prince of Wales's Theatre. For two seasons before her marriage she managed the theatre alone. She secured as a leading actor Squire Bancroft, whom she had met shortly before in Liverpool and married in December 1867. The Prince of Wales's soon became noted for its series of successful comedies by T. W. Robertson, namely: \"Society\" (1865), \"Ours\" (1866), \"Caste\" (1867), \"Play\" (1868), \"School\" (1869) and \"M. P.\" (1870).\n\nBancroft regularly took the principal female parts in these pieces, her husband playing the leading man. Together, Robertson and the Bancrofts are considered to have instigated a new form of drama known as 'drawing-room comedy' or 'cup and saucer drama'. The Bancrofts gave Robertson an unprecedented amount of directorial control over the plays, which was a key step to institutionalizing the power that directors wield in the theatre today.\n\nThe Bancrofts were also responsible for making fashionable the 'box set', which Lucia Elizabeth Vestris had first used at the Olympic Theatre in the 1830s – this consisted of rooms on stage which were dressed with sofas, curtains, chairs, and carpets on the stage floor. They also provided their actors with salaries and wardrobes. Also, the Bancrofts redesigned their theatre to suit the increasingly upscale audience: \"The cheap benches near the stage, where the rowdiest elements of the audience used to sit were replaced by comfortable padded seats, carpets were laid in the aisles, and the pit was renamed the stalls.\"\n\nOther plays that the Bancrofts produced at the Prince of Wales's Theatre were \"Tame Cats\" (1868), \"The School for Scandal\" (1874), \"Sweethearts\" (1874), \"The Vicarage\" (1877), and \"Diplomacy\" (1878, an adaptation of Victorien Sardou's \"Dora\"). Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft likewise presented at their theatre a number of prominent actors, among them Hare, Coghlan, the Kendals, and Ellen Terry. In 1879, she reprised a favourite role of hers, Nan, in John Baldwin Buckstone's \"Good for Nothing\", in a mixed bill alongside W. S. Gilbert's \"Sweethearts\", in which she played Jenny Northcott.\n\nIn 1879, the Bancrofts moved to the Haymarket Theatre, a larger house, where they continued the successful presentation of modern comedy until both retired from the stage on 20 July 1885, having made a considerable fortune producing theatre. After that, they rarely appeared onstage.\n\nBancroft was the author of the novel \"The Shadow of Neeme\". She also collaborated with her husband in the production of two volumes of reminiscences called \"Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft On and Off the Stage, Written by Themselves\" (London, 1888) and \"The Bancrofts: Recollections of Sixty Years\" (Dutton and Co.: London, 1909).\n\nBancroft recorded three 10\" discs for the Gramophone Company in June 1903.\n\n\n"}

He was noted for his language ability; he spoke English, French, Spanish, German, Russian, Italian, Polish, Danish and Swedish.\n\nIn his teens, Emil joined the Russian Navy as a midshipman. By 1871, at the age of 18, he deserted his ship in Venezuela. Kosterlitzky then traveled to the Mexican state of Sonora, where he changed his name to \"Emilio\" and joined the Mexican Army. During the 1880s he fought in the Mexican Apache Wars. He also assisted American troops pursuing Apaches across the border under the 1882 United States–Mexico reciprocal border crossing treaty. Kosterlitzky became known to the American troops, who called him the \"Mexican Cossack\".

{"id": "5081637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5081637", "title": "Georg Scherer", "text": "Georg Scherer\n\nGeorg Scherer (1540 – 30 November 1605) was a Roman Catholic pulpit orator and controversialist.\n\nBorn at Schwaz, in Tyrol, Scherer entered the Society of Jesus in 1559. Even before his ordination he was famed for his preaching powers. For over forty years he labored in the Archduchy of Austria. To Scherer, in part, it owes the retention of the faith. In 1577 he was Court preacher to the Archduke Matthias; he retained the post until 1600. In 1590 he was appointed Rector of the Jesuit College at Vienna; the sternness of his character scarcely fitted him for the office, and he was transferred (1594) to Linz. The story of his being struck blind in the pulpit, after having exclaimed: \"If the Catholic Church is not the True Church, may I become blind,\" is a pure invention.\n\nScherer was a man of boundless energy and rugged strength of character, a strenuous controversialist, a genuinely popular orator and writer. He vigorously opposed the Tübingen professors who meditated a union with the Greek Schismatics, refuted Lutheran divines like Osiander and Heerbrand, and roused his countrymen against the Turks. Believing like his contemporaries that the State had the right to put witches to death, he maintained, however, that since they were possessed, the principal weapons used against them should be spiritual ones, e.g.exorcisms or prayer. Scherer's severe attitude towards witchcraft did not meet the approval of his general, Acquaviva. His eloquence and zeal made many converts, amongst them the future Cardinal Khlesl. His works were collected and published by the Premonstratensians of Bruck, Moravia (1599–1600), and again issued at Munich (1613–1614).\n\nIn 1583, Scherer played a role in Vienna's one and only case of witch-burning. 70-year-old Elise Plainacher of Mank, Lower Austria, a Lutheran, had raised her granddaughter Anna Schlutterbauer ever since the girl's mother died. When Anna was 17 her father, Elise's Catholic son-in-law, took custody and moved with Anna to St. Pölten. There, the girl suffered seizures, probably epileptic, that were blamed on a hex placed by her grandmother. Anna and Elise were brought to Vienna, where Scherer conducted a rigorous \"investigation\" (exorcisms combined with interrogation) at St. Barbara's Church in Fleischmarkt. Over the course of several days, Scherer claimed to have discovered 12,652 demons inhabiting Anna's body and spirit. At length the exhausted and confused girl agreed that her grandmother had hexed her. Elise was taken to the notorious Rogues' House (\"Malefizhaus\") at 10 Rauhensteingasse for interrogation under torture. Her eventual confession was so unconvincing that the mayor of Vienna appealed to Emperor Rudolf II to overturn it, but Scherer brought ecclesiastical pressure to bear and the Emperor declined the petition. Elise Plainacher was burned at the stake and her ashes thrown into the Danube on 28 September 1583.\n\nScherer died in Linz of apoplexy.\n"}

He developed the limera1n jailbreak tool and bootrom exploit for iOS. He is also noted for his technical efforts and publicity with reverse engineering the PlayStation 3 video game console, and for subsequently being sued by and settling with Sony. As of September 2015, he is working on his vehicle automation machine learning company comma.ai.\n\nHe attended the Bergen County Academies, a magnet public high school in Hackensack, New Jersey. He attended Academy for Engineering and Design Technology. Hotz is an alumnus of the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth program. Hotz also briefly attended Rochester Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nIn August 2007, seventeen-year-old George Hotz became the first person reported to carrier-unlock an iPhone. According to Hotz's blog, he traded his second unlocked 8 GB iPhone to Terry Daidone, the founder of Certicell, for a Nissan 350Z and three 8 GB iPhones.\n\nIn September 2007, an anonymous group achieved a software-only unlocking method to complement Hotz's hardware-based unlocking method.\n\nOn July 13, 2010, Hotz announced the discontinuation of his jailbreaking activities, citing demotivation over the technology and the unwanted personal attention. Nevertheless, he continued to release new software-based jailbreak techniques until October 2010.\n\nIn December 2009, Hotz announced his initial intentions to breach security on the Sony PlayStation 3. Five weeks later, on January 22, 2010, he announced that he had performed his first theoretical achievement. This consists of the initial read and write access to the machine's system memory as well as hypervisor level access to the machine's CPU.\n\nOn January 26, 2010, Hotz released the exploit to the public. On March 28, 2010, Sony responded by announcing their intention to release a PlayStation 3 firmware update that would remove the OtherOS feature from all models, a feature that was already absent on the newer Slim revisions of the machine.\n\nOn July 13, 2010, never having achieved any method of reading, installing, or modifying software on the PS3, Hotz posted a message on his Twitter account stating that he had abandoned his efforts of trying to crack the PS3 any further due to the system security's extreme difficulty.\n\nOn December 29, 2010, notable hacking group fail0verflow, known for the reverse engineering of security models found in consumer electronics devices, performed an academic presentation at the 27th Chaos Communications Congress technical conference, of their accomplishments with the PlayStation 3. They presented the methods they'd devised for having successfully penetrated the device's security model, yielding the root signing and encryption keys. These keys are the essential element of a full (and even minimally usable) breach, capable of installing and running any new software on any PlayStation 3 unit.\n\nOn January 2, 2011, Hotz posted a copy of the root keys of the PlayStation 3 on his website. These keys were later removed from his website as a result of legal action by Sony against fail0verflow and Hotz. In response to his continued publication of PS3 exploit information, Sony filed on January 11, 2011 for an application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against him in the US District Court of Northern California. On January 14, 2011, Hotz appeared in an interview on G4's \"The Loop\", where he explained his involvement with the PlayStation 3.\n\nAfter the root keys of the console were published, Sony initiated litigation against George Hotz and predecessor PlayStation 3 hacking group known as fail0verflow. Hotz published his commentary on the case, including a song about the \"disaster\" of Sony. Sony in turn has demanded social media sites, including YouTube, to hand over IP addresses of people who visited Geohot's social pages and videos; the latter being the case only for those who \"watched the video and 'documents reproducing all records or usernames and IP addresses that have posted or published comments in response to the video\".\n\nPayPal has granted Sony access to Geohot's PayPal account, and the judge of the case granted Sony permission to view the IP addresses of everyone who visited geohot.com. In April 2011, it was revealed that Sony and Hotz had settled the lawsuit out of court, on the condition that Hotz would never again resume any hacking work on Sony products.\n\nAt the end of April 2011, an anonymous hacker broke into the PlayStation Network and stole personal information of some 77 million users. Hotz denied any responsibility for the attack, and said \"Running homebrew and exploring security on your devices is cool; hacking into someone else's server and stealing databases of user info is not cool\".\n\nIn June 2014, Hotz published a root exploit software hack for Samsung Galaxy S5 devices used in the US market. The exploit is itself built around Linux kernel CVE-2014-3153, which was discovered by hacker Pinkie Pie, and it involves an issue in the Futex subsystem that in turn allows for privilege escalation. The exploit, known as \"towelroot\", was designated a \"one-click Android rooting tool\" by the hacking community because it was designed to be installed quickly like an App; other rooting hacks were typically uploaded from a nearby PC with a cable and necessitated rebooting the device with a special set of key presses.\n\nAlthough originally released for the Verizon Galaxy S5, the root exploit was made compatible with most Android devices available at that time. For example, it was tested and found to work with the AT&T Galaxy S5, Nexus 5, and Galaxy S4 Active. Updates continued to be applied to the root exploit to increase its capabilities with other devices running Android. Updates to the Android operating system closed the source of the exploit. Samsung officially responded to the towelroot exploit by releasing updated software designed to be immune from the exploit.\n\nIn addition to having made a meaningful side income from public donations solicited for his exploits, Hotz has been employed at Facebook and Google.\n\nOn June 27, 2011, ZDNet freelance reporter, Emil Protalinski reported that according to a Facebook spokesman, Hotz had been hired by the company in an unknown role. However, according to a CNET article, he had actually been employed since May, which was confirmed by Facebook. In January 2012, Hotz was no longer employed by Facebook.\n\nOn July 16, 2014, Google hired Hotz to work in their software security auditing team called Project Zero, which \"hopes to find zero-day vulnerabilities before the NSA\". Hotz worked in Project Zero for 5 months where he developed Qira - an open source program for dynamically analysing application binaries.\n\nIn January 2015, Vicarious.com hired Hotz to develop AI algorithms where he worked for 7 months.\n\nSince September 2015, Hotz has been working on his own AI startup called comma.ai. In an interview with Bloomberg, Hotz revealed he is building vehicular automation technology based on artificial intelligence algorithms. Hotz has built a working self-driving 2016 Acura ILX, which he demonstrated on the I-280 in a video. The video prompted a cease and desist letter from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Hotz wants to sell his technology to Tesla Motors and he has reported to have talked to CEO Elon Musk and is working on proving his technology to be superior to that of Mobileye, which, at the time, was used for Tesla Autopilot. \nTesla later released a statement on their website citing corrections to the Bloomberg article, stressing that their autopilot system was developed in-house, with a vision chip component from MobilEye, instead of one separate autopilot system manufactured by MobilEye, as suggested by Bloomberg reporter Ashlee Vance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered advice on Hotz's self-driving car project in a December 2015 interview.\n\nOn October 27, 2016, the NHTSA informed Hotz that this product was legally required to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and requested information that would confirm such compliance. A day later, George Hotz tweeted from Shenzhen that the comma one was cancelled. Kristen Lee stated on Jalopnik that the NHTSA was simply trying to open a dialog, and commented that \"Instead, they got the worst attitude possible from Silicon Valley: try and regulate us, thought leaders, and we’ll take our ball and go home.\"\n\ncomma.ai open sourced their self driving car software on November 30, 2016, emphasising its intended use for research without any warranty.\n\nOn September 14th, 2018, comma.ai announced Hotz would become the Head of Research Team for the project, and appointed Riccardo Biasini as the new CEO of the company.\n\nHotz was a finalist at the 2004 ISEF competition in Portland, Oregon with his project \"The Mapping Robot\". Recognition included interviews on the \"Today Show\" and \"Larry King\". Hotz was a finalist at the 2005 ISEF competition, with his project \"The Googler\". Continuing with robots, Hotz competed in his school's highly successful Titanium Knights battlebots team.\n\nHotz competed in the 2007 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, a science competition for high school students, where his 3D imaging project, entitled \"I want a Holodeck\", received awards and prizes in several categories including a $20,000 Intel scholarship. He travelled to Sweden to speak about the project at the Stockholm International Youth Science Seminar.\n\nHotz has received considerable attention in mainstream media, including interviews on the \"Today Show\", Fox, CNN, NBC, CBS, G4, ABC, CNBC, and articles in several magazines, newspapers, and websites, including Forbes, and BBC.\n\nIn March 2008, PC World magazine listed Hotz as one of the top 10 Overachievers under 21.\n\nIn August 2013, Hotz attended DEF CON with Carnegie Mellon's Plaid Parliament of Pwning (PPP). PPP placed first in the DEF CON Capture the Flag (CTF) tournament. Later in 2013, Hotz also competed in CSAW 2013. Working alone, Hotz took first place under the pseudonym tomcr00se. In August 2014, Hotz once again competed as part of Carnegie Mellon's Plaid Parliament of Pwning to win the DEF CON CTF tournament for a second year in a row. The team also won the DEF CON \"Crack Me If You Can\" tournament.\n\n\n"}

Some 800,000 weapons have been collected since the CCM launched this project, called Transforming Guns into Hopes.\n\nThe name, is inspired by a Bible verse from the book of Micah: 'They will hammer their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks'.\n\nMabunda is a partner artist of the African Artists for Development, an organisation that backs community development projects associated with works by contemporary artists.\n\nGonçalo Mabunda uses Kalashnikovs, rockets, pistols, and shell casing in order to make anthropomorphic figures out of the deconstructed weapons. By turning weapons into life-like figures, Mabunda literally turns death into life. The figurines are also representative of the over 1 million people killed during his country’s civil war. Mabunda has also lost relatives during the war, which makes working with and deconstructing weapons used during the 16-year war more important for him. He makes thrones and masks out of these deactived weapons used during the Mozambique Civil War. The masks are based on traditional Sub-Saharan African masks, however, the original twist on the art form by creating them out of weapons is unique to Mabunda. Representing power, Mabunda’s thrones mock how the traditional power rests on weapons. By using weapons, Mabunda’s work carries the message of how further violence can be prevented, and that destroying the weapons of war can be done in an aesthetic and artistic way. Mabunda’s art directly challenges the absurdity of war. His work has a modernist style to it and has been compared to the work of Braque and Picasso.\n\nGonçalo Mabunda’s artwork has been followed by the international press, French Newspaper Le Monde, huffingtonPost from the UK are among medias that followed Mabunda’s work effect on his local community.\n\nIn 2014, Mabunda was one of 20 African artists to figure in French art collector André Magning publication \"African Stories\". In 2015, Mabunda’s works were the main subject of CNN show \"Inside Africa\", a TV series highlighting different economic, social and cultural personalities in Africa.\n\nFormer US President Bill Clinton, a fan of Mabunda’s work, commissioned the artist to create trophies for his philanthropic organisation the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nIn July 2017, his pieces were shown in the European Parliament in an exhibition organized by the European Centre for Electoral Support at the occasion of the launch of a handbook produced in the context of a project funded by the European Union on \"Preventing Electoral Conflicts and Violence in the countries of the Southern African Development Communities\" that includes Mozambique. The launching seminar in the European Parliament was chaired by the Member of the European Parliament, Judith Sargentini, former Chief Observer to the EU election observation mission in Mozambique and Tanzania and co-chaired by Alojz Peterle, Member of the European Parliament, former Chief Observer to the EU election observation mission in Kenya.\n\n"}

He is a Dinka tribesman.\n\nMaker competed in the men's marathon at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Due to civil war that saw South Sudan split from Sudan, he has refused to compete under the flag of the latter, stating that, \"It would be betraying my people\". He was one of four athletes competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics under the Olympic flag rather than that of an individual country.\n\nMaker left home at the age of seven to live with his uncle in northern Sudan. In 1994, at the age of nine, he fled from a refugee camp during the Sudanese Civil War. While 28 members of his family were killed during the conflict, he was able to escape to Egypt, and then permanently to the United States. He was granted refugee status by the United States when he was 16, and now lives and trains in Flagstaff, Arizona. Though his parents survived the civil war, at the time of the 2012 Olympics he had not seen them in 20 years. However he returned to South Sudan in 2013 and was reunited with his parents. Eight of his brothers and sisters were killed in the war.\n\nHe began participating in track and field while attending high school in Concord, New Hampshire, after being encouraged by his gym teacher and also competed in college at Iowa State, where he was an All-American athlete.\n\nMarial fulfilled the A-qualification standard for the marathon in October 2011, allowing him to participate in the Olympic marathon event at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Marial's case was called \"unique\" by the IOC, as prior to the games South Sudan had yet to form a National Olympic Committee and seek full recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which would have allowed them to send a team and compete under the flag of South Sudan. He holds permanent resident status in the United States, but not citizenship. According to his interview in Runner's World, He applied for naturalization to become a U.S. citizen in 2011 and had his naturalization interview, but his application remains pending: \"Technically, I was supposed to be a citizen last June, because I did everything, I did my citizen test, I did my interview, I did my fingerprint, and everything was all set. All I needed to do was go to their office and get my passport and do the ceremony. That was in June 2011, but there has been a security background check...and that's what took everything longer.\"\n\nThe National Olympic Committee of Sudan offered to allow Marial to compete as a member of the Sudanese team, however he rejected this offer, saying, \"It's not right for me to do that. It's not right for me to represent the country I refuged from.\" He went on to say, \"If I ran for Sudan, I would be betraying my people. I would be dishonoring the two million people who died for our freedom.\"\n\nThe IOC-executive board announced its decision on 20 July to allow Marial to participate as an Independent Olympic Athlete.\n\nMarial's travel documentation could not reach him in time, and so he could not march in the Opening Ceremony on 27 July.\n\nMarial finished 47th in the marathon, with a time of 2:19:32. His personal best is 2:12:55.\n\nHe competed at the 2012 Olympics using his adopted name of Marial, which was the surname of his uncle, however he has since reverted to his birth name.\n\nMaker became an Airman in the United States Air Force on 2 February 2018.\n\n"}

His father, as well as his brother Khalid, were killed in the 2011 Navy SEAL raid.\n\nIn January 2001, Hamza (then 12 years old), his father and other family members attended the wedding of his brother Mohammed bin Laden in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. Video footage shot in Ghazni province in November of the same year shows Hamza and some of his siblings handling U.S. helicopter wreckage and working alongside Taliban resistance.\n\nIn March 2003, it was claimed that Hamza and his brother Saad bin Laden had been wounded and captured in Ribat, Afghanistan. This claim eventually proved false.\n\nHamza married a daughter of Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah when he was 17 years old.\n\nIn August 2018, \"The Guardian\" quoted Hamza's uncles as saying he had married a daughter of 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta. However, Hamza's brother Omar bin Laden denied the report.\n\nIn a 2005 video titled \"The Mujahideen of Waziristan\", Hamza is shown participating in an al-Qaeda assault on Pakistani security forces in the south Waziristan tribal region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. In September 2007, it was reported that he was again in the tribal belt that encompasses the Pakistan/Afghanistan border region taking a senior role with al-Qaeda forces.\n\nIn July 2008, \"The Sun\" published a translation of a poem said to be written by Hamza, which had been published on an extremist Islamic Web site. In the poem Hamza wrote \"Accelerate the destruction of America, Britain, France and Denmark.\" In response British MP Patrick Mercer dubbed Hamza bin Laden the \"Crown Prince of Terror\".\n\nHamza bin Laden was implicated in the 2007 assassination of the former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. However, according to an interrogation of former al-Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Hamza was under house arrest in Iran when Bhutto was assassinated and was not released until 2010.\n\nOn 14 August 2015, he released an audio message for the very first time. He called upon followers in Kabul, Baghdad and Gaza to wage jihad, or holy war, on Washington, London, Paris and Tel Aviv.\n\nOn 11 May 2016 it was reported he had released an audio message focused on the issues of Palestine and the Syrian Civil War. He said the \"blessed Syrian revolution\" had made the prospect of \"liberating\" Jerusalem more likely. \"The Islamic umma (nation) should focus on jihad in al-Sham (Syria) … and unite the ranks of mujahedin,\" he said. \"There is no longer an excuse for those who insist on division and disputes now that the whole world has mobilised against Muslims.\"\n\nIn July 2016, media reported that he had issued an audio message threatening the United States in revenge for his father's death. In the 21-minute speech entitled \"We Are All Osama\", he said \"We will continue striking you and targeting you in your country and abroad in response to your oppression of the people of Palestine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia and the rest of the Muslim lands that did not survive your oppression,\" Hamza said. \"As for the revenge by the Islamic nation for Sheikh Osama, may Allah have mercy on him, it is not revenge for Osama the person but it is revenge for those who defended Islam.\" In May 2017, a recording by Hamza bin Laden was published by As-Sahab, encouraging terrorist attacks against Western targets.\n\nIn the light of his growing influence within al-Qaeda, the United States classified Hamza bin Laden as Specially Designated Global Terrorist in January 2017. This effectively put him on a blacklist aimed at restricting his movement and economic abilities.\n\nIn May 2017, a video was released in which he calls on his followers to attack Jews, Americans, Westerners and Russians, via lone wolf attacks using any means possible.\n\nHamza is the son of Khairiah Sabar of Saudi Arabia, one of bin Laden's three wives who were living in the Abbottabad compound. \nInterrogation of the surviving wives of Osama bin Laden by Pakistani intelligence after the raid on the Abbottabad compound revealed Hamza was the only person missing. He was not among those killed or injured. The raid conducted by the SEAL team was thorough: infrared technology, as well as ground troops, remained confident nobody inside the compound had escaped. There were no hidden exit tunnels from the compound.\n\nIn a letter confiscated in the raid, written by bin Laden and addressed to his \"Chief of Staff\" Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, bin Laden mentions his desire that Hamza would be educated in Qatar as a religious scholar so that he could \"refute the wrong and the suspicions raised around Jihad.\" The same letter revealed that Hamza did not escape the raid because he was not even present in Abbottabad. Letters from the compound also confirmed that Osama was grooming Hamza to be his heir apparent following the death of Hamza's older brother Saad in a 2009 US drone strike.\n\n"}

A resident of Westfield, Indiana, Baumeister was under investigation for murdering over a dozen men in the early 1990s, most of whom were last seen at gay bars. Police found human remains on Baumeister's property and issued an arrest warrant, after which he fled to Canada and subsequently committed suicide before he could be brought to trial. He never confessed to the crimes and his suicide note made no mention of the murder allegations. He was later linked to a series of murders of at least nine men along Interstate 70, which occurred in the early to mid-1980s.\n\nBaumeister was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister. His childhood was reportedly normal. By the onset of adolescence, however, he began exhibiting anti-social behavior; acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk. In his teens, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, but did not receive further psychiatric treatment. In 1965, Baumeister attended Indiana University for a semester before dropping out, and later returned in 1967. In 1972, he attended a semester at Butler University. As an adult, he drifted through a series of jobs, marked by a strong work ethic, but also by more and increasingly bizarre behavior.\n\nBaumeister married Juliana \"Julie\" Saiter in November 1971, a union that produced three children. Julie later said they had been sexually intimate only six times in over 25 years of marriage. In the 1970s, he was committed to a psychiatric hospital by his father. His wife said he was \"hurting and needed help.\" He founded the successful Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain (two stores total) in Indianapolis in 1988 (not affiliated with Save-A-Lot grocery store chain).\n\nBy the early 1990s, investigators with the Marion County Sheriff's Department and the Indianapolis Police Department began investigating the disappearances of gay men of similar age, height, and weight in the Indianapolis area. In 1992, investigators were contacted by a man named Tony Harris claiming that a gay bar patron calling himself \"Brian Smart\" had killed a friend of his and had attempted to kill him with a pool hose during an erotic asphyxiation session. Harris eventually happened to see this same man again in August 1995, following him and noting a license plate number. From this data, police identified \"Brian Smart\" as Herb Baumeister.\nInvestigators approached Baumeister, told him he was a suspect in the disappearances, and asked to search his house. When Baumeister refused, investigators confronted his wife, Julie, who also forbade police to search the house. By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behavior that, after filing for divorce, she consented to a search. The search of the estate, Fox Hollow Farm, was conducted while Baumeister was on vacation; it turned up the remains of eleven men, eight of whom were identified.\n\nWith a warrant out for his arrest, Baumeister fled to Ontario, Canada, where he committed suicide at Pinery Provincial Park by shooting himself in the head. In his suicide note, he described his failing marriage and business as his reason for killing himself. He did not confess to the murders of the men found in his backyard.\n\nBaumeister would posthumously be suspected of killing nine other men, the bodies of whom were found in rural areas along the corridor of Interstate 70 between Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio during the early to mid 1980s. One eyewitness identified Baumeister as the man seen leaving a bar in 1983 with Michael Riley who was later found dead; like the other victims, Riley was strangled to death and deposited nude or semi-nude in a river.\n\nThe A&E television series \"Investigative Reports\" aired an episode about Baumeister titled \"The Secret Life of a Serial Killer\" in 1997. History featured the case in their \"Perfect Crimes\" series. The case was also featured on \"The Investigators\" on TruTV in 2008, \"Behind Mansion Walls\" on Investigation Discovery (ID) and \"Paranormal Witness\" on Syfy in 2012, and \"Ghost Adventures\" in May 2014. An independent documentary film titled \"The Haunting of Fox Hollow Farm\" also explores the crimes and the possibility of hauntings on the grounds of Baumeister's former home. ID featured the case again on the series \"True Nightmares\", in October 2015. The \"Crime Junkie\" podcast released an episode on Baumeister on March 4, 2018.\n\n\n"}

He revolted against King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1134.\n\nHugh was the son of Hugh I of Jaffa and his wife Mamilia (or Mabilla). According to William of Tyre, his father had come to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage during the reign of Baldwin II, and Hugh was born in Apulia during the journey. However, according to John L. La Monte, it is more likely that Hugh I came to the east with Bohemund of Taranto in 1106. In any case, Hugh I was named Count of Jaffa after his arrival (by Baldwin I, if in 1106), but soon died.\n\nWhen Hugh II came of age he arrived in Jerusalem to claim his inheritance, and married Emelota (or Emma), niece of the Patriarch Arnulf of Chocques. Hugh was a relative of Queen Melisende, King Fulk's wife, as their fathers Hugh I and Baldwin II were cousins; Melisende's grandmother, also named Melisende, was a sister of Hugh's grandmother Alice. Hugh had a close relationship with Melisende, but he \"...was rumoured to be on too familiar terms with the queen...\" (William of Tyre, 14.16) and came into conflict with a jealous Fulk. It was also rumoured that Hugh was simply arrogant and refused to pay homage to Fulk. The latter rumour also seems to the basis of the account of Orderic Vitalis; according to him, Hugh and other nobles were offended by Fulk, who brought Angevin nobles and counsellors with him when he became king, and ignored the native barons of the kingdom.\n\nIn 1134 Hugh seems to have revolted against Fulk, along with Roman of Le Puy, lord of Oultrejordain. According to William of Tyre, Hugh's stepson Walter I Grenier, Lord of Caesarea (Emelota's son through her first marriage to Eustace Grenier) accused Hugh of treason and conspiracy at a meeting of the \"Haute Cour\"; Walter possibly did this with the urging of Fulk himself. Hugh denied the charges, and it was decided that the matter would be settled by judicial combat. When the appointed day arrived, Hugh did not appear, and he was found guilty \"in absentia\".\n\nHe allied with the Egyptian city of Ascalon, and Fulk invaded Jaffa and besieged the city. Hugh's rear-vassals, including Baldwin of Ramla and Barisan, constable of Jaffa, deserted him and \"wisely betook themselves to the king.\" (William of Tyre, 14.16) The usual punishment for such actions was permanent exile and confiscation of the rebel's territories, but in this case, perhaps due to Hugh's high status in the kingdom and his relationship with the queen, the Patriarch William mediated in the dispute, and Hugh was exiled for only three years.\n\nHugh was free to remain in Jerusalem while waiting for a ship to take him into exile. One day, while playing dice on the street, he was brutally attacked by a Breton knight. The knight was quickly apprehended and convicted:\n\nRumours spread that Fulk himself had hired the knight to assassinate Hugh, and public opinion considered Hugh to be innocent of the charges of treason and conspiracy. Fulk ordered \"...that the tongue should not be included among the members so mutilated\", supposedly so that he would not be accused of trying to silence the knight. In any case, the knight claimed to have acted on his own:\n\nNevertheless Fulk no longer had the support of the public in the dispute.\n\nHugh remained in the kingdom for a short time, while his wounds healed. He then went into exile in Apulia, where his relative Roger II of Sicily named him Count of Gargan. Hugh never fully recovered, and died soon after his arrival.\n\nWhether or not Fulk hired the Breton knight, he has been suspected, by Hans Mayer and other historians, of inciting Hugh to revolt so that he might take personal control of Jaffa. Because Hugh died before his three years of exile were over, his territories were confiscated and added to the royal domain, where they remained for the rest of the 12th century. Fulk began to build numerous castles in the area, including Ibelin, to defend against Egyptian invasions. As a consequence of the revolt, the former rear-vassals of Jaffa became more powerful, such as Ramla. The lords of Ibelin and Ramla would become important in the affairs of the kingdom later in the century.\n\nThe dispute also led to a rift between Fulk and Melisende. Melisende, who legally ruled the kingdom in her own right with Fulk as consort, was supported by the Church and various other nobles, and Fulk and his supporters in the dispute for a time felt unwelcome and even unsafe. According to William of Tyre, \"from that day forward, the king became so uxorious that...not even in unimportant cases did he take any measures without her knowledge and assistance.\" (William of Tyre, 14.18)\n\nHugh's revolt was previously dated to 1132, due to the evidence in William of Tyre and Arab historian Ibn al-Qalanisi. However, William's chronology is probably confused, and al-Qalanisi's references to conflicts in the kingdom probably refer to those between Fulk and Pons of Tripoli in 1132. Hugh appears as count of Jaffa in charters dated to 1133 and 1134, and the date of 1134 is now accepted by most scholars.\n\n"}

He began his career in the late 1990s on alternative rock station WAVF 96.1 FM using the moniker \"Southern Avenger\", an anonymous pro wrestler/superhero-style character. In 2007, Hunter began appearing every Tuesday and Friday morning on WTMA News-Talk 1250 AM, and contributed to a weekly column to the \"Charleston City Paper\". Hunter was also an aide to U.S. Senator Rand Paul, whom Hunter helped write the book \"The Tea Party Goes to Washington\". He is perhaps best known for his decades-old, racially charged writings whose reemergence caused a major media controversy for his boss, Senator Paul.\n\nHunter's reputation as a political operative was discredited following the \"Washington Free Beacon\"'s revelation in July 2013 that he had repeatedly espoused racist views on a local South Carolina radio station under the Southern Avenger moniker. His racist comments included expressions of contempt for Hispanic immigrants, and a call for NAACP director Kweisi Mfume, whom he referred to as \"NAACP Grand Wizard,\" to be tied to a tree and whipped. Following these revelations, Hunter resigned from Rand Paul's staff in what the Senator called a \"mutual decision.\" In a November 2013 article for \"Politico\", Hunter repudiated his former views, writing \"I'm not a racist; I just played one on the radio.\"\n\nHunter is known for often providing commentary from libertarian and conservative viewpoints, with a particular focus on Ron Paul's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns as well as Senator Rand Paul's influence within the Republican Party. Hunter has said he sees the liberal internationalism that is found in the Democratic Party and the neoconservatism prominent in the Republican Party to be ultimately indistinguishable from one another, which has led to criticism from both the mainstream left and the mainstream right.\n\nHunter supports a non-interventionist foreign policy and considers the current U.S. foreign policy a disaster. He is also critical of neoconservatism.\n\nHunter became the center of controversy in 2013 when the \"Washington Free Beacon\" reported that he had once espoused racist views on a local South Carolina radio station under the Southern Avenger moniker. His comments included expressions of contempt for Hispanic immigrants, and a call for NAACP director Kweisi Mfume, whom he referred to as \"NAACP Grand Wizard,\" to be tied to a tree and whipped. Following these revelations, Hunter resigned from Rand Paul's staff in what the Senator called a \"mutual decision.\"\n\nHunter's writings were reported by numerous mainstream media outlets on July 9, 2013. The Washington Post noted that Hunter had previously written that \"Americans aren't wrong to deplore the millions of Hispanics coming here\" and that \"a non-white majority America would simply cease to be America.\" \n\nThe \"Free Beacon\" also noted that Hunter had previously written in support of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and formerly had served as a chairman of the League of the South, which advocates Southern secession and, according to the Anti-Defamation League, promotes the idea of a society dominated by whites. Hunter was also criticized for suggesting that African-American director Spike Lee be tied to a tree and whipped for his critical comments about Mel Gibson's movie, \"The Patriot\".\n\nCritics on both the political left and the political right condemned Hunter for the past remarks, and some political analysts said that Senator Rand Paul's continuing association with Hunter would imperil Paul's prospects as a contender in the United States presidential election, 2016.\n\nOn July 18, Hunter's former longtime editor at the \"Charleston City Paper\", Chris Haire, wrote an article sharply critical of both Hunter and Paul, denouncing Hunter for having asked Haire, long before the current controversy had erupted, to remove from the internet dozens of past columns that Hunter said no longer reflected his views. Haire called the request cowardly and said that Hunter had made it solely for appearances—to help Paul in the 2016 presidential campaign. Noting controversial writings by Hunter \"in support of racially profiling Hispanics, praising white supremacist Sam Francis, blast[ing] the House of Representative's apology for slavery\" and calling upon black Americans to \"apologize to white people for their high crime rates\", Haire characterized Hunter as \"the most common kind of racist, the one that doesn't realize that he is one\".\n\nBy July 21, less than two weeks after the original \"Washington Free Beacon\" article had been published, Hunter had resigned from his position on Paul's staff, saying he wanted to avoid being a distraction for the senator. Hunter also said he would return to political commentary. Paul called the resignation \"a mutual decision,\" agreeing that Hunter's past views had become a distraction.\n\nIn a statement written in response to the controversy, Hunter wrote that he was \"embarrassed by some of the comments I made precisely because they do not represent me today.\" He also expressed abhorrence of racism and criticized the \"Free Beacon\" article as \"not accurately reflect[ing]\" his character or views.\nIn June 2015, Hunter wrote a piece in \"The Daily Beast\" condemning his past promotion of Confederate iconography in light of the Charleston church shooting. He continues to express regret about his past views and opposes the alt right and other movements that promote white nationalism or racial hatreds.\n\n\nIn March of 2017, Jack Hunter is reported to have sent his wife a divorce notice via email. https://www.facebook.com/celebritarianmagazine/photos/a.421159818007871.1073741828.413214485469071/504863009637551/?type=3&theater\n"}

As a student, he published his first two works, \"Observations sur Émile\" (on Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"\") in 1763 and \"Des Préjugés\" in 1764.\n\nIn 1765 he became a lawyer at the \"parlement\" of Aix-en-Provence, and soon obtained so great a reputation that he was instructed by Étienne François de Choiseul in 1770 to draw up the decree authorizing the marriage of Protestants. From 1778 to 1781, Portalis was one of the four \"assessors\" or administrators of Provence.\n\nIn November 1793, after the First French Republic had been proclaimed, he came to Paris and was thrown into prison for being the brother-in-law of Joseph Jérôme Siméon, the leader of the Federalists in Provence. He was soon released to a \"maison de santé\", where he remained until the fall of Maximilien Robespierre during the Thermidorian Reaction.\n\nOn being released he practised as a lawyer in Paris, and, in 1795, he was elected by the capital to the Council of Ancients of the French Directory, becoming a leader of the moderate party opposed to the directory rule. As a leader of the moderates, he was targeted by the \"coup d'état\" of 18 Fructidor, but, unlike General Charles Pichegru and François Barbé-Marbois, he managed to escape to Switzerland, then to Holstein, and did not return until after Napoleon Bonaparte established himself as the leader of the new Consulate.\n\nBonaparte made him a \"conseiller d'état\" in 1800, and then charged him, with François Denis Tronchet, Félix-Julien-Jean Bigot de Préameneu, and Jacques de Maleville, to draw up the \"Code Civil\". Of this commission he was the most notable member, and many of the most important titles, notably those on marriage and heirship, are his work. He gave a famous speech, \"Discours préliminaire au projet de code civil\" in which he presented the core principles of the civil code: legal certainty (non-retroactivity), the notion of \"ordre public\" and the forbidding of the \"arrêt de règlement\" which was a characteristic production of the Ancien Régime's judges and was contrary to the idea that only the law prevails.\n\nIn 1801 he was placed in charge of the Department of Religion or Public Worship, and in that capacity had the chief share in drawing up the provisions of the Concordat of 1801. In 1803 he became a member of the Académie française, in 1804 Minister of Public Worship, and in 1805 a \"Chevalier Grand-Croix de la Légion d'honneur\". He soon after became totally blind, and, after an operation, he died at Paris.\n\n\n"}

After a rather scanty education, he entered his father's business, but later took a farm. He married and brought up a family of seven children.\n\nIn 1819 Wroe became ill with a fever and two doctors who attended him considered his life was in serious danger. Wroe asked for a minister to come and pray with him. Although his wife sent for four church ministers, each refused his request. Wroe then asked his wife to read a few chapters of the Bible to him, and after a while, he gradually recovered his bodily health, but his mental distress continued and he \"wrestled with God\" day and night for some months.\n\nA short time later, Wroe started having visions, and often became blind and unable to speak — on one occasion remaining blind for six days. During these periods, Wroe said, many remarkable events were foretold and revealed to him: the Spirit told him to relinquish his worldly employment, so he devoted his life to travelling and preaching, where he gained many followers and persuaded them that he was a messenger of God.\n\nWroe, although often persecuted and threatened, travelled throughout Europe including Gibraltar, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. He later travelled to the United States, and Australia.\n\nHe died in Melbourne, Australia, in 1863, aged 81, leaving the church affairs in the hands of his trustees. The Christian Israelite Church was originally set up in Gravesend, Kent, but its headquarters moved to Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, which the church wanted to turn into a \"new Jerusalem\". From 1822 to 1831 Ashton-under-Lyne was the church's headquarters. Wroe intended to build a wall around the town with four gateways, and although the wall was never constructed, the four gatehouses were, as was a printing press. Popular opinion in the town turned against Wroe when he was accused of indecent behaviour in 1831, but the charges were dismissed. The Church spread to Australia, where it is still active.\n\nWroe’s life was the basis of a novel, \"Mr Wroe's Virgins\" by Jane Rogers. In 1993 Jonathan Pryce featured as Wroe, alongside Kathy Burke and Minnie Driver, in a BBC mini-series adaptation of the novel directed by Danny Boyle.\n\n\n"}

Her two feature narratives—\"The Cruz Brothers and Miss Malloy\" (1980) and \"Losing Ground\" (1982)—furthered the range of Black women's films. Although \"Losing Ground\" was denied large-scale exhibition, it was among the first films created by a Black woman deliberately designed to tell a story intended for popular consumption, with a feature-length narrative structure. Collins thus paved the way for Julie Dash's \"Daughters of the Dust\" (1991) to become the first feature-length narrative film created by a Black woman to be placed in commercial distribution. Influenced by Lorraine Hansberry, she wrote about \"African Americans as human subjects and not as mere race subjects\" [emphasis in the original].\n\nBorn to Loretta (\"née\" Pierce) and Frank Conwell and raised in New Jersey, Kathleen, at the age of 15,\n\nwon first prize at an annual poetry reading contest at Rutgers Newark College of Arts and Sciences for her rendition of Walt Whitman's 'A Child Goes Forth' and 'I Learned My Lesson Complete'. An article in the March 3, 1958 \"Jersey Journal\" reported that in addition to working as assistant editor of the Lincoln High School's publication the \"Leader\", Conwell was on the editorial staff of the school yearbook, the \"Quill\"; a member of the National Honors Society; and a past secretary of the Student Council.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1959, Collins went to Skidmore College, where she received a BA in philosophy and religion in 1963. In 1962, after her campus was visited by two leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), she became active in the Civil Rights Movement, canvassing in Georgia for black residents to register to vote; as a result, she was arrested twice while working with the Albany Movement.\n\nAfter she graduated from Skidmore, she taught high-school French in Newton, Massachusetts, while attending graduate school at Harvard at night. In 1965, she won a scholarship to study in France at Paris-Sorbonne University, where, in 1966, she obtained an MA in French literature and cinema.\n\nCollins joined the faculty of City College at the City University of New York and became a professor of film history and screenwriting, where cinematographer Ronald K Gray encouraged her to go ahead with a screenplay she had adapted from a Henry Roth short story. That film became \"The Cruz Brothers and Mrs. Malloy\", which eventually won First Prize at the Sinking Creek Film Festival. This was followed in 1982 by \"Losing Ground\" (starring Seret Scott, Bill Gunn, and Duane Jones), which she wrote and directed. \"Losing Ground\" was the first feature-length drama directed by a black American woman and won First Prize at the Figueroa International Film Festival in Portugal, garnering much international acclaim. Both films were shot in Rockland County, New York, and are currently distributed by Milestone Films.\n\nCollins wrote many other plays and screenplays, but her two most well-known theatrical plays are \"In the Midnight Hour\" (1981) and \"The Brothers\" (1982), both of which are available through Samuel French. Themes frequently explored in her work are issues of marital malaise, male dominance and impotence, freedom of expression and intellectual pursuit, and her protagonists are cited as \"typically self-reflective women who move from a state of subjugation to empowerment.\"\n\nOn Collins' abrupt death in 1988, the bulk of her work, most of it unpublished, was left to her daughter, Nina Collins, who in 2006 began to sift through her mother's enormous archive and began working to have it published, restored and reissued.\n\nIn 2015 \"A Public Space\" posthumously published Collins' short story \"Interiors\", a fictionalized account of her divorce from her first husband.\n\nCollins' 1982 \"Losing Ground\" was restored and reissued in 2015. The film had its first theatrical release in 2015 at Film Society of Lincoln Center, opening the series \"Tell it like it is: Black Independents in New York, 1968-1986\". It would later be described in \"The New Yorker\" as \"the great rediscovery of 2015\". \"Losing Ground\" and \"The Cruz Brothers and Mrs. Malloy\" were released together on two-disc sets (DVD or Blu-ray) by Milestone in April 2016.\n\nIn December 2016, a collection of Collins' short stories was published under HarperCollins' Ecco imprint under the title \"Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?\" The title story was published by \"Granta\" in July 2016. These acclaimed stories were written in the 1970s and mined some of the same intimate territory of Black women's lives, loves, and losses as \"Losing Ground.\" Prior to its release, it was listed as one of the most anticipated books of the fall of 2016 by the \"Huffington Post, New York, The Boston Globe, Lit Hub,\" and \"The Millions.\" The collection received starred reviews in \"Kirkus Reviews\" and \"Publishers Weekly\" and was named one of the best books of 2016 by outlets that included \"Elle,\" NPR, \"Nylon\", \"Publishers Weekly, and\" VICE.\n\nCollins was married, but divorced in 1975. She had two children from her marriage: Nina Lorez Collins and Emilio Collins. She was married a second time, to Alfred Prettyman.\n\nCollins died from breast cancer in 1988 at the age of 46, in Memorial Hospital, New York.\n\n"}
{"id": "51467728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51467728", "title": "Legend of Billy the Kid", "text": "Legend of Billy the Kid\n\nThe legend of Billy the Kid has acquired iconic status in American folklore, yet the outlaw himself, also known as William Bonney, had minimal impact on historical events in New Mexico Territory of the late 1800s. More has been written about Billy the Kid than any other gunslinger in the history of the American West, while hundreds of books, motion pictures, radio and television programs and even a ballet have been inspired by his legend.\n\nWhen he was still alive, \"Billy the Kid\" had already become a nationally known figure whose exploits, real and imaginary, were reported in the National Police Gazette and the large newspapers of the eastern United States. After his death on July 14, 1881, all of New York City's papers ran his obituary, and within days, newspapers around the United States were printing exaggerated and romanticized accounts of Billy the Kid's short career. In the fifteen or so dime novels about his criminal career published between 1881 and 1906, the Kid was an outlaw antihero, customarily depicted as a badman with superior gunslinging skills, or even as a demonic agent of Satan who delighted in murder.\n\nWithin six weeks of Bonney's death there appeared the first complete narrative of his life, \"The True Life of Billy the Kid\". Written by dime novelist John Woodruff Lewis under the pen name \"Don Jenardo\", this pulp novel depicted Billy the Kid as a sadistic psychopath.\n\nPat Garrett, smarting from local outrage over his shooting of the Kid, wanted to present his side of the story and hoped to turn a profit as well on the American public's fascination with the notorious outlaw. Consequently, he published his account of Bonney's life, \"The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid\", in 1882. It was credited to Garrett, but the first fifteen chapters were a concoction of factual material mixed with fabrications, written by Roswell's postmaster, Ash Upson, an itinerant journalist. The remaining chapters, written in a more restrained style, are generally accurate, and were likely composed by Garrett himself. The book failed to find a wide audience and sold just a few copies; nevertheless, although filled with many errors of fact, \"The Authentic Life\" served afterwards as the main source for most books written about the Kid until the 1960s. Thus was established the mythic stature of Pat Garrett as the heroic lawman in pursuit of the villainous but romantic desperado, Billy the Kid.\n\nThe lawman and former ranch hand Charlie Siringo, who in his youth had ridden the range of eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle, the familiar haunts of William Bonney and Pat Garrett, and knew both of them, first told his version of the Kid's story in a chapter of his book, \"A Texas Cowboy\" (1885). In 1920, he published a sympathetic biography, \"History of Billy the Kid\", in which he described the daily life of a cowboy realistically, but romanticized his account of Bonney with fantasies and exaggerations—its title page claimed \"His six years of daring outlawry has never been equalled in the annals of criminal history.\"\n\nThree governors of New Mexico wrote accounts of their dealings with Billy the Kid. Miguel Antonio Otero, the first governor of the territory, knew William Bonney, and was the first Mexican-American author to write about him. Otero's book, \"The Real Billy the Kid: With New Light on the Lincoln County War\", was published in 1936. In it, he wrote admiringly of Bonney and described events of the time and place from the perspective of native New Mexicans. The Kid spoke Spanish fluently and was well-liked by the \"Hispanos\" of the Pecos River Valley, who told many stories about \"el Chivato\", their colloquial Spanish for a young goat or kid.\n\nThe modern legend of Billy the Kid as an immortal figure of the Old West first developed within a larger cultural context of social upheaval in the late 19th and early 20th century United States. Between 1897 and 1909, during the Progressive era of political activism and reform, the popular American novelist Emerson Hough wrote magazine articles, novels and informal histories that reintroduced Billy the Kid to a national audience, albeit in works that often relied more on fantasy than on actual events. Hough embellished the Kid's reputation with lurid descriptions of his exceptional villainy in an article called \"Billy the Kid: The True Story of a Western 'Bad Man' \", written in 1901 for the literary publication, \"Everybody's Magazine\", using language like \"the soul of some fierce and far-off carnivor got into the body of this little man, this boy, this fiend in tight boots and a broad hat.\" Hough further developed this image of the Kid in his book about western desperados, \"The Story of the Outlaw\" (1907), though not in such excessive language.\n\nBy the mid-1920s, however, Bonney's place in the general awareness of the American public had diminished to the point that in 1925 Harvey Fergusson asked in the \"American Mercury\" magazine, \"Who remembers Billy the Kid?\". His reputation was revitalized the next year when Walter Noble Burns's book, \"The Saga of Billy the Kid\", appeared as the Book-of-the-Month Club selection for December 1926, and became a bestseller. This success, and the fact that people who had actually known William Bonney were beginning to talk to reporters and write their memoirs, allowed stories of his exploits to regain a nationwide audience. Publication of \"The Saga\", in spite of its dubious facts and fabricated events, subsequently led to a proliferation of other books, magazines and newspaper articles, and then movies, about the life of Billy the Kid.\n\nDepictions of Billy the Kid in popular culture fluctuated between the poles of cold-blooded murderer without a heart and sentimental hero fighting for justice. Kent Ladd Steckmesser wrote: \"There are two Billy the Kids in legend. The first is a tough little thug, a coward, a thief, and a cold-blooded murderer. The second is a romantic and sentimental hero, the brave and likeable leader of an outnumbered band fighting for justice.\" Both facets of his legend were perpetuated in often poorly researched biographies, as well as in fictionalized B movies, many of which were nonetheless commercially successful.\n\nThe dramatic aspects of William Bonney's short life and violent death still appealed to popular taste, as they had in the heyday of the dime novels, but eventually an idealized image of Billy the Kid, as one who defends the underdog and fights against social injustice, came to the fore. The Texas historian, J. Frank Dobie, wrote in \"A Vaquero of the Brush Country\" (1929): \"...because his daring apotheosized youth—youth in the saddle—youth with a flaming gun—and because his daring kept him running and balancing on the edge of a frightful precipice...Billy the Kid will always be interesting, will always appeal to the popular imagination.\"\n\nWith the publication in 1926 of Walter Noble Burns's book,\"The Saga of Billy the Kid\", the Kid's legend revived and was consolidated as a standard tale of the American Old West. The American movie director King Vidor, who had wanted to film a Western-themed movie for some time, was inspired when he read Burns's book, and felt that the Kid's story had considerable dramatic appeal. Following the commercial success of the first movie he directed for the Metro Goldwyn Mayer studio, \"The Big Parade\" (1925), he was able to obtain backing for a Billy the Kid production when Irving Thalberg, an executive at MGM, took an interest in his proposal. \"Billy the Kid\", the first talking picture version of the legend, was released in 1930. The film featured former college football star Johnny Mack Brown in the title role and Hollywood character actor Wallace Beery as Pat Garrett, but it was a box office failure. Nevertheless, Vidor's \"Billy the Kid\" set the pattern for Billy the Kid movies for the next fifty years, as other filmmakers followed its formula and made the Kid an instrument of justified vengeance and his enemies the villains of the story.\n\nAs Billy the Kid was reborn a romantic or tragic figure in literature and films of the 1920s–1940s; high culture began to turn its attention to his legend in the late 1930s. Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder with George Balanchine of the School of American Ballet, drew material from Burns' book to write the libretto for a ballet to be called \"Billy the Kid\", performed by his new group, the \"Ballet Caravan\". Composer Aaron Copland was commissioned to score the music, and Eugene Loring to do the choreography. The ballet premiered at the Chicago Civic Opera House on October 16, 1938, and has since become a repertory standard.\nCopland arranged the score for a concert suite that was performed and recorded in 1959 by Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra; the recording was released by Columbia Records in 1960.\n\n\"The Outlaw\", starring Jack Buetel as Billy the Kid, Walter Huston as Doc Holliday, and Jane Russell in her first movie role, was produced by Howard Hughes and finished in 1941, though not released until 1943. The film, directed for the most part by Howard Hawks (Hughes got the screen credit), was promoted in a publicity campaign with posters featuring Russell posing in dishabille and her cleavage prominently displayed. Its emphasis on Jane Russell's physical attributes led to the film being dubbed the first \"sex western\". Although the movie was generally panned by movie critics, it was rereleased twice over the course of the next decade, grossing more than $20 million and solidifying the legend of Billy the Kid (although a distorted and unhistorical one) in the consciousness of the American filmgoing public.\n\nThe film director Sam Peckinpah attempted an ambitious retelling of the legend in his last western film, \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\" (1973), covering the last few months of Bonney's life, in which the violence and physical brutality of the world the protagonists inhabited is portrayed realistically. The film suffered from production difficulties as well as from Peckinpah's battles with MGM over his artistic vision and budget overruns. The studio's drastically cut release version, disowned by Peckinpah, was initially a failure with major critics and the viewing public. Although its depiction of the Kid as a roguish anarchist opposed to illegitimate law (as enforced by Garrett on behalf of a corrupt power structure) was suited to the temper of the times, it quickly left first-run theaters. Soon, however, reviews began to appear in smaller film magazines and journals in the United States and abroad that praised its artistry and breadth of vision. The film's reputation was on the ascendancy long before Peckinpah's preferred cut of the preview version was finally shown at the University of Southern California in 1986, and its critical stature has continued to increase since—Martin Scorsese, e.g., called it a \"masterpiece\". Despite the liberties it took with history, scholar and film editor Paul Seydor described \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\" as among the finest treatments of the legend in any medium.\n\nThe psychoanalyst Alfred Adler wrote an analysis in 1951 of the mythic aspects of the legend of Billy the Kid in which he compared the Kid to Oedipus, King Arthur, Robin Hood, and other legendary heroes of the past. Adler was the first writer to discuss the symbolic significance of Billy the Kid's nickname as a cultural totem.\n\nArthur Penn's film, \"The Left Handed Gun\" (1958), portrays Billy the Kid as a misunderstood youth, played by Paul Newman in the manner of James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\", according to the film critic Robert Kolker. It similarly addresses the psychological motivations of those of its characters who resort to violence, in a pseudo-Freudian treatment of the subject characteristic of certain 1950s movies.\n\nIn 1941 Life magazine ran a piece on Billy the Kid called \"America's Best-Loved Badman\". The historian Stephen Tatum, writing forty years later, referred to the contradictory aspects of the mythical Billy the Kid, calling him a \"flexible container\" into which audiences poured their \"hopes and fears, ideals and prejudices.\" Writers and filmmakers have often depicted William Bonney as the personification of the \"free-running reprobate\" of the Old West, of the sort whom the reformed outlaw Emmett Dalton wondered if \"he symbolizes the undying anarchy in the heart of every man.\" In any case, the mythical Billy the Kid remains an icon of popular American culture, and the skinny, bucktoothed kid from New York City occupies the top place in Western American folklore. The mythologizing continues with new works in various media.\n\n"}

After his father's death in 1595, his mother married Thomas Russell of Alderminster, who was named by William Shakespeare as one of the two overseers of his will. There are varying opinions about the extent to which the young Leonard Digges might have been influenced in his choice of profession by his stepfather's association with Shakespeare; disagreements about whether he was or was not personally acquainted with the playwright have in recent years eclipsed discussion of the work of Digges himself.\n\nLeonard Digges matriculated at University College, Oxford in 1603, the year of his mother's remarriage, and graduated BA in 1606. This was followed by a period of study abroad. He may have traveled to Spain with fellow Hispanist James Mabbe, whom he knew from Oxford, for he wrote a note on the flyleaf of a book which Mabbe sent from Madrid to Will Baker, also a friend from Oxford days. The book was a copy of \"Rimas\" by Lope de Vega (published in 1613); it still survives, in the library of Balliol College. Digges's inscription reads:\n\nAnthony a Wood said of Leonard Digges that he \"was esteemed by those who knew him in Univ.coll. a great master of the English language, a perfect understander of the French and Spanish, a good poet, and no mean orator.\" Wood says also that \"upon his supplication made to the venerable convocation\" of University College Oxford, Digges was made M.A. in 1626, \"in consideration that he had spent many years in good letters in transmarine universities.\" He lived in the College from then until his death in 1635, and was buried in the College chapel (no longer standing).\n\nDigges translated Claudian's \"The Rape of Proserpine\" (printed 1617). His translation of \"Varia fortuna de soldado Píndaro\" by Gonzalo de Céspedes y Meneses, was published in 1622 as \"Gerardo, the Unfortunate Spaniard\", and was used by John Fletcher as a source for his plays \"The Spanish Curate\" and \"The Maid in the Mill\".\n\nDigges's publisher was Edward Blount, a close friend of Mabbe's and one of the syndicate which published Shakespeare's First Folio in 1623. Digges and Mabbe both contributed prefatory poems to the Folio, as did Ben Jonson—also published by Blount. The previous year, Digges and Jonson had both contributed commendatory verses to a work translated by Mabbe and published by Blount. Commendatory verses by Digges were also included in an edition of Shakespeare's \"Poems\", published by John Benson in 1640, five years after Digges had died. Freehafer suggests that since these verses refer to Shakespeare's plays rather than to his poems, they may have been intended for the Second Folio.\n\n"}

Persian Christians have Arabic names indistinguishable from their Muslim neighbors. They can also use Arabic derivations of Christian names (such as saints' names), or Greek, Assyrian, or Armenian names, as most Christian Iranians are Armenian Iranians.\n\nMany Persian names come from the great Persian literature book, \"Shahnameh\" (The Epic of Kings). It was composed in the 10th century by Ferdowsi and is considered by many the masterpiece of Persian literature.\nApproximately 10%-15% of all Persian names are from Shahnameh. A few examples are Abtin, Ardeshir, Armeen, Arzhang, Babak (Papak), Bijan, Bizhan, Bozorgmehr, Darab, Dariush (Darius), Esfandiar, Esfandyar, Javid, Faramarz, Farhad, Fariborz, Farshid, Farzad, and Yazdan.\n\nPrior to 1919, the people of Persia (Iran) did not use surnames. An act of the Vosough od-Dowleh government in 1919 introduced the use of surnames, and the practice expanded during the reign of Reza Shah (r. 1925–1941). Prior to that, a person was often distinguished from others by a combination of prefixes and suffixes attached to his or her name. If it was omitted, that person might be taken for someone else. Since the adoption of surnames, Ahmadi has become the most popular surname in Iran.\n\nIn many cases individuals were known by the name of the district, city, town, or even the village from which they came by using the locality's name as a suffix, for example: Nuri, Khorasani, Mazandarani, Kordestani, Tehrani, Esfahani, Gilani, Hamedani, and Shirazi. The same rule is followed for the many millions of Iranians who have surnames of regions or cities of the Caucasus region. The latter was forcefully ceded in the course of the 19th century to Imperial Russia through the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828). Examples of common Iranian surnames in this regard are Daghestani, Gharabaghi, Darbandi, Shirvani, Iravani, Nakhjevani, Lankarani. \n\nAmong many other secularization and modernization reforms, surnames were required by Reza Shah, following similar contemporary patterns in Turkey under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and later in Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser.\n\nNote: Some of the names below are of Middle Persian origin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His paternal grandmother, María Bernarda Colón Sierra, was descendant of Christopher Columbus. Ramón’s father, José de Altarriba y Colón de Larreátegui (1804-1870), 11th and 22nd barón de Sangarrén, was a Carlist highly esteemed by Carlos VI; no details of his involvement in the movement are available. Ramón’s mother, also from Aragón, María Pilar Villanueva y Altarriba (1820-1895), was daughter of and second cousin of his father José.\n\nNone of the sources consulted clarifies why the family lived in the French Bayonne, a usual location for Carlist exiles and refugees fleeing Spain in the aftermath of defeat suffered during the First Carlist War. Ramón was one of 8 siblings and the second oldest son. His older brother, José María, upon return to Aragón followed the family path and also engaged in Carlist activities, which did not prevent him from becoming comisario regio for Zaragoza in 1869; he inherited all family titles in 1870. Ramón as a youngster moved from France to Spain and entered Real Seminario Científico Industrial, a state-ran and highly esteemed Gipuzkoan educational establishment in Bergara. He is reported as enrolled in 1854, though it is not clear when he completed the curriculum; the standard cycle lasted 5 years.\n\nRamón Altarriba y Villanueva married Rosa Guerra y Serbi; nothing is known of this marriage, apart that his wife died in 1875 and the couple had no issue. He then espoused María de la Blanca Porcel y Guirior (1859-1940), heir to aristocratic family originating from Gipuzkoa and Andalusia. Since her father died in 1873 with no male descendants, having been the oldest daughter she arranged to inherit his titles as 7th and San Millán; Altarriba became marqués consorte. The couple had two sons, Ramón and Jaime Altarriba y Porcel. Nothing is known about the former; the latter (1884–1936) joined artillery and pursued a military career. He became comandante de Artilleria, maestrante de la and an entrepreneur. Also an active Carlist, in 1934 he headed finance section of . The 1936 coup surprised him in the Gipuzkoan spa of Zestoa, where he was detained by the republican militia and died.\n\nUpon the outbreak of Primera Guerra de Marruecos in 1859 the young Altarriba volunteered to the army; accepted, he was assigned to the Aragon infantry unit of Regimento de Zamora and landed in Ceuta in December 1859. Details of his service are unclear, though he certainly entered many combat actions against the Moroccan troops. Serving under the command of Antonio Ros de Olano in January 1860 he might have taken part in the battle of Castillejos; bypassing Monte Negrón in a dare Spanish maneuver, he then participated in the battle of Cabo Negro. For meritorious service Altarriba was awarded Cruz de San Fernando and got promoted to teniente. Late 1860 the unit returned to the Zaragoza barracks. Apparently enjoying adventurous life and vivacious company, he demonstrated some gift for rhyming couplets; at that time he befriended . During the next few years Altarriba continued his military career, though no details are known.\n\nFollowing the Revolution of 1868 Altarriba requested and was granted release from military service, though he returned to the army in 1871. Once the Republic was declared he approached the conspiring Carlists and at the outbreak of the Third Carlist War he was already incorporated in their army. He was assigned to the Northern front and took command of an insurgent volunteer Biscay battalion, which conquered and cleared the Durango district in 1873. Promoted to coronel, he then commanded primera brigada de Vizcaya and joined the siege of Bilbao in early 1874; he led the unit routing the Republican forces during the and advancing later to Portugalete, where Altarriba was given the privilege of accepting surrender of the famous battalón de Segorbe. Participated in a number of skirmishes at the outskirts of Bilbao, assaulting the forts of Delmas and Volantín. Nominated Comandante General del Alto Aragón, Altarriba was the organizer, sponsor and commander of Battalón de Almogávares de la Virgen del Pilar, leading it early 1875 during the defense of the so-called línea de Carrascal and in the Navarrese battles of Lumbier and Etxauri. In final phase of the war and in unclear circumstances there was an investigative proceeding launched against Altarriba; eventually cleared of all charges, he was promoted to brigadier. Located in mid-range command chain, he did not make it amongst top Carlist commanders and did not supervise operations above the tactical level. Nominated adjutant to Carlos VII, in reward for his service Altarriba was conceded the title of conde de Altarriba.\n\nA widower with no close family, it is not clear where Altarriba settled after the war; in 1877 he was linked to the Catalan town of Aviá. In 1878 he was already married and assumed administration of his wife’s property in Gipuzkoa. The estates slightly exceeding 1,000 ha rendered the couple the 4th largest terratenientes in the province and one of the richest people in Gipuzkoa. His wife held land also in Álava and Andalusia; for some time Altarriba managed the Pinos Puente estate in Granada, which she possessed jointly with her two unmarried sisters, though with rather mediocre result. In 1878 José María Altarriba, unmarried and with no issue, renounced baronia in favor of his younger brother, making Ramón the 24th barón de Sangarrén.\n\nAltarriba seemed pessimistic as to the future of Carlism, considered orphaned, with no political direction and managed by ineffective Junta Militar. In 1878 he wrote to Carlos VII urging him to appoint a strong political leader. As in early 1879 the military rule was terminated and civic rights restored in Gipuzkoa, Altarriba – already admitted to a meeting of leading Carlists – spoke in favor of taking part in the elections. The claimant allowed only individual unofficial contenders and authorized Sangarrén. Fielding his candidature in the Azpeitia district, Altarriba was considered one of the 4 \"transigentes\" running; he emerged as the only one victorious. Elected, he settled permanently in Madrid. He attempted re-election in 1881 but lost both in Tolosa and Azpeitia.\n\nThe 1880s are marked by growing rivalry within Carlism, divided between the immovilistas and the aperturistas. The former, led by , opted for intransigence. The latter, Altarriba included, dismissed either war or total abstention, preferring conditional alignment with the new political system. The dispute grew into a full-scale conflict, waged also by means of guerra periodistica; to fight the Nocedalista titles, Sangarrén founded a Madrid satirical weekly, \"El Cabecilla\". During the 1884 election campaign Altarriba sought Carlos VII’s exemption from \"despotism\" of Nocedal, who ordered abstention, but this time the claimant did not agree and Sangarrén loyally withdrew from the race 3 weeks prior to election date. Two years later, already a recognized Carlist leader, he obtained the permission and was re-elected from Azpeitia. Focused on by the press as a single Carlist in the Cortes, when sworn Altarriba declared in the house that he considered Carlos VII the king of Spain.\n\nAs the Nocedalista crisis entered its terminal phase, in 1887 Altarriba engaged in a related conflict with Francisco Cavero y Alvarez de Toledo, the jefe of Aragón, with Carlos VII intervening and ordering truce; some authors claim that Cavero was dismissed. Though assaulted by the Nocedalista press for his defense of Manifesto de Morentin, in the unfolding press war Altarriba defended the vacillating \"La Fe\" and did not side unconditionally with the claimant; Carlos VII’s entourage counted him among \"malos Carlistas\". Somewhat accidentally triggering the final breakup in Vascongadas, at the decisive moment he stayed loyal to his king.\n\nFollowing secession of the Integristas Altarriba, the only party MP and one of its few aristocrats, found himself in top strata of Carlism and became one if its most distinguished politicians. His relations with other party leaders were uneasy, even after departure of the allegedly hated Nocedal. The undisputed Traditionalist leader in Vascongadas , the claimant’s personal secretary conde de Melgar and the aspiring political leader, marqués de Cerralbo found it difficult to work with Sangarrén and did not spare him harsh words; in the intrigue-ridden world of Carlism of the late 19th century he was accused of envy towards legitimate party leaders and turning Gipuzkoa into his personal fiefdom. When in late 1888 he was appointed vice-president of the newly established Junta Directiva del Circulo Tradicionalista de Madrid, he refused the post claiming – probably sarcastically – that he did not merit such an honor.\n\nIn 1889 Carlos VII started to build formal nationwide party structures, initially disguised as an organization to stage celebrations of centenary; within its Junta Central, soon turned into a permanent collegial executive, Sangarrén was nominated to represent Castilla la Vieja. Like 10 years earlier, he called for a new jefe which would impose the party discipline, though it is not clear whether he himself hoped for the job. In the fall of that year liberal press speculated about a directorate leading the movement and mentioned him one of its 4 members. Altarriba’s position was confirmed when he was invited to Frohsdorf for the wedding of Carlos VII’s daughter. Though in early 1890 \"El Cabecilla\" mocked marqués de Cerralbo, when later that year the latter was finally appointed the new Jefe Delegado Sangarrén rushed with congratulations, directed to \"mi querido amigo\".\n\nAhead of the 1891 elections for the first time during Restoration the Carlists decided to take part officially and set up a co-ordinating committee. Details of its work are not known; the outcome was that in Azpeitia, which turned into a prestigious battlefield against the rebellious Ramón Nocedal, Sangarrén had to give way to the aspiring Gipuzkoan leader, Tírso de Olazábal. Himself he ran in two districts, Aranda de Duero (Burgos) and Santo Domingo de la Calzada (Logroño), losing in both. Following this defeat, he did not renew his electoral bid in any of the successive electoral campaigns.\n\nHaving lost the parliamentary ticket Sangarrén could dedicate more time to his private business, geographically scattered from Vascongadas across Castille and on to Andalusia. Apart from managing family estates in Gipuzkoa, he invested in mining and metalworking industry. He co-owned exploration rights to a copper mine in the Sierra de Guadarrama location of Colmenarejo, North of Madrid. In 1893 he took control over the \"La Fe\" mineral springs in the nearby Moralzarzal, renaming the site \"\" and exploiting it until 1900, when he renounced the concession. He held stakes in paper mill business in Pyrenaic parts of the Lérida province and was vice-president of Derecha del Rio Genil, a Granada-based company engaged in irrigation works.\n\nAs the Carlist fuerista principles envisaged that a politician should only represent the region where he lives, within the party command structures Altarriba formally headed Castilla la Vieja. Though due to his terrateniente status he exercised largest influence in Gipuzkoa, Vascongadas was first headed by Valde-Espina, then by Salvador Elío y Ezpeleta and later by Tirso de Olazábal. Altarriba’s contribution to Gipuzkoan Carlism, however, remained crucial; local landowners were key to mobilising rural support and maintaining – if not straightforwardly financing – provincial party structures. Partially as a result of his contribution, in the 1880s and 1890s Gipuzkoa emerged as a Carlist stronghold; in provincial and general elections the party was striving for domination.\n\nIn the early 1890s fellow Traditionalists approached Altarriba cautiously as one of \"fractious Carlists\". Some sources report him as championing a militant \"de armas tomar\" group, consisting mostly of the Navarros and the Gipuzkoanos. Other episodes seem to counter this thesis indicating that he worked closely with the non-belligerent de Cerralbo, together travelling across Spain during innovative political tours and delivering harangues, also jointly with Carlist pundits like Vazquez de Mella; residing in Madrid he customarily appeared in events staged in the capital. As the colonial crisis of 1897 unfolded, he initially seemed leaning towards a bold action; he welcomed general Weyler, dismissed from Cuba, amongst the crowd shouting \"Viva Cuba Española\", but also a somewhat more ambiguous \"a caballo mi general\". However, during the Spanish–American War Sangarrén was busy denouncing widely circulating rumors about another Carlist insurgency forthcoming as \"a fable\", though it is not clear whether it was a pre-agreed propaganda smoke-screen or a genuine effort. During La Octubrada, the series of minor Carlist revolts of October 1900, he was in Paris, which did not spare him detention by Guardia Civil the following month in Bilbao. Also during persistent rumors of mid-1902 Altarriba spoke publicly against a Carlist military action. The press reported him as an agreed Carlist candidate in the 1903 elections, but he was not mentioned as running later on. None of the sources consulted mentions him politically active after that date; obituaries claimed he had been suffering from an unidentified longtime \"enfermedad crónica\"; his funeral was attended by the then Carlist political leader, Matías Barrio y Mier.\n\n\n\n"}

He made a telescope for the Paris Observatory in 1820 and in 1825 he made a 6.5 inch (16.5 cm) refractor for the observatory of the Collegio Romano, a Jesuit academy in Rome. In the Royal Observatory, Greenwich an 1838 instrument named the Sheepshanks telescope includes an objective by Cauchoix.\n\nAlthough the reflector telescope was invented in the second half of the 18th century, technological difficulties made the refractor the telescope of choice until the mid-1850s. Improvements in lens production, like the introduction of the achromatic lens by John Dollond, spawned an aperture size race that started in the early 1820s with a telescope made by the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer. Cauchoix must be credited holding the lens size record three times this period. In 1831, Cauchoix made a 13.3 inch (almost 33.8 cm) refractor for the Irishman Edward Joshua Cooper, who used it to observe Halley's Comet in 1835 and a solar eclipse in 1836.\n\nIn 1829, Cauchoix made an 11.75 inch lens for a French customer, but sold it to the British astronomer James South.

Their father, James Allason, was also a Conservative Party MP.\n\nRupert Allason contested Kettering in 1979 and Battersea in 1983 before being elected as Conservative MP for Torbay in 1987.\n\nHe was opposed to ceding greater power to Brussels, in 1993 he was the only Tory who refused to vote for the Maastricht Treaty when it was made into a motion of confidence. The vote was narrowly won but Allason's abstention caused him to have the party whip withdrawn for a year.\nHe left parliament after the landslide 1997 general election, when he lost his seat to Liberal Democrat Adrian Sanders. He is widely considered to have lost because he failed to tip a pub waitress a week before polling day. As a consequence, fourteen waiters who were going to vote for Allason switched to the Liberal Democrats. He lost by twelve votes.\n\nIn 2000, Allason was reported to have considered joining the UK Independence Party (UKIP). The author Jon Ronson in the first chapter of his book \"\" briefly analyses Allason's career and character, with particular emphasis on his 1997 electoral loss.\n\nAs an author, Allason has concentrated on security and intelligence issues and his controversial books have frequently made headlines. He was voted 'The Experts' Expert' by a panel of other spy writers in \"The Observer\" in November 1989. In 1984 \"The Sunday Times\" commented: \"His information is so precise that many people believe he is the unofficial historian of the secret services. West's sources are undoubtedly excellent. His books are peppered with deliberate clues to potential front-page stories.\"\n\nAllason has been a frequent speaker at intelligence seminars and has lectured at both the KGB headquarters in Dzerzhinsky Square, Moscow and at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, where he once addressed an audience that included the Soviet spy Aldrich Ames. He continues to lecture to members of the intelligence community at the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies in Washington, D.C.\n\nHis special contribution to the study of modern historical espionage has been in tracking down former agents and persuading them to tell their stories. He traced the wartime double agent GARBO, who was reported to have died in Africa in 1949. However, Allason found him in Venezuela, and they collaborated on the book \"Operation Garbo\", published in 1985. \n\nHe was also the first person to identify and interview the mistress of Admiral Canaris, the German intelligence chief who headed the Abwehr, and he was responsible for the exposure of Leo Long and Edward Scott as Soviet spies.\n\nHis titles include \"The Crown Jewels\", based on files made available to him by the KGB archives in Moscow; \"VENONA\", which disclosed the existence of a GRU spy-ring operating in London throughout the war, allegedly headed by Professor JBS Haldane and the Hon.

The case was heard by Mr Justice Drake, without a jury. The judge ruled that Allason had failed to demonstrate that the \"Daily Mirror\" article, although inaccurate, had caused him any financial loss. In a retrial in 1998, he was awarded £1,050 in damages and 75% of his legal costs.\n\nIn 1998, he brought and lost a libel action against the BBC show \"Have I Got News for You\" over comments made in a book based on the show published in 1996 that \"given Mr Allason's fondness for pursuing libel actions, there are also excellent legal reasons for not referring to him as a conniving little shit.\"\n\nIn 2001 Allason sued Random House, the publishers of \"The Enigma Spy\", the autobiography of the former Soviet agent John Cairncross. Allason claimed he had ghostwritten \"The Enigma Spy\" in return for the copyright and 50 per cent of the proceeds. However, Allason lost the case and was ordered to pay costs of around £200,000. In passing judgment the trial judge said that Allason was \"a profoundly dishonest man\" and \"one of the most dishonest witnesses I have ever seen\". \n\nIn September 2005, Allason was threatened with prison for contempt of court in relation to paying the damages from the 2001 case.\n\nAllason is the recipient of the U.S. Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO)'s Lifetime Literature Achievement Award, and in 2011 he was elected to the Honorary Board of that association.

Hopkins' father, Thomas Snell Hopkins, had moved to Washington in the 1860s from Maine where the family homestead remains. Sherburne's ancestor Stephen Hopkins (1583–1644) came to Plymouth, Massachusetts on the \"Mayflower\".

He graduated with a degree in international law from Columbia University in 1890 and joined his father's practice. While establishing himself as a lawyer in his father's practice, Hopkins married Hester Davis in 1891, with whom he had two children, Sherburne Philbrick on December 3, 1891, and Marjorie on August 5, 1894. Their son, Sherburne Philbrick, later also a lawyer in the family firm, briefly became a social star when he married Margaret Upton, better known as Peggy Hopkins Joyce, a famous stage actress. The law firm now called Hopkins and Hopkins became one of the top lobbying firms for Wall Street in Washington.\n\nOne of their largest clients was the \"King of Trusts,\" Charles Ranlett Flint. In 1892, Flint, also from an old Massachusetts family, had merged several rubber companies to form the monopolistic conglomerate United States Rubber Company. His principal lawyer for this merger was Thomas Snell Hopkins. In another famous merger, Flint organized the main bubblegum manufacturers into American Chicle Company in 1899. In 1911, Flint founded the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, which later became IBM. His rubber business necessitated large investments in Latin America, Africa, and India. Flint especially had large real estate interests in southern Mexico. He joined with Henry Clay Pierce to become one of the largest investors in Mexican railways and international shipping companies such as the Pierce Forwarding Company of New Orleans. Pierce had purchased a majority share in the National Railroad of Mexico in 1903. In Mexico, one of Flint's competitors in the rubber industry was Evaristo Madero, the grandfather of future Mexican president Francisco I. Madero. The Maderos had dealings with Flint in the very beginning of the Mexican Revolution, which rightfully prompted historians to suspect Flint's financing of the upheaval. Flint also held large interests in Pierce's endeavors helping the oil magnate stay clear of hated rival John D. Rockefeller who owned the Standard Oil Company. \"To the question whether Capt. Sherburne G. Hopkins of Washington had represented him [Pierce] in negotiations with Carranza he declined to answer, though he said that the law firm of Hopkins and Hopkins had looked after his interests in Washington for the last twenty-five years. His acquaintance with Capt. Hopkins is slight, but his father, Thomas S. Hopkins, has long been his attorney in Washington.\" Thomas Hopkins and his son Sherburne provided the legal work for Pierce and Flint. On January 3, 1900, the St. Louis Republic reported that Hopkins and Hopkins negotiated with the U.S. State Department on behalf of Flint. The British had confiscated several loads of flour off the coast of what is today Mozambique. The illegally seized freight had belonged to Flint's shipping concern. In the effort to force the British to release the cargo Hopkins had strong support from the State Department as well as from the German Foreign Office. In addition to Flint's flour, British warships had impounded a German mail steamer bound for home. The flour cargo spoiled, but Britain had to reimburse Flint for the damages.\n\nIn 1898, Sherburne Hopkins joined the active navy in the Spanish–American War. It is unlikely that Hopkins saw much action. As the commander of the District of Columbia Naval Militia, Hopkins seemed to have stayed put while Admiral George Dewey defeated the Spanish on the other side of the world. Hopkins' name is mentioned in a newspaper article in October 1898, when he took command of the USS \"Fern\", a twenty-five-year-old tugboat. However, rather than being dispatched to the war zone, Hopkins' task was to \"bring the \"Fern\" to Washington.\" His rank is given as lieutenant. According to his own testimony to the U.S. Senate in 1912, Hopkins' responsibility \"was …in the purchase of some materials of war for our own Government…\" Through the years of his service in the naval reserves, Hopkins in fact had risen to the rank of lieutenant commander. When in the fall of 1899 Admiral Dewey returned to the United States a hero, Hopkins found mention in the official program of Dewey's Washington, D.C. rally as \"Naval Battalion, Lieut. Commander Sherburne G. Hopkins, Commanding.\" His nickname among military peers was Sherby. Raised to the rank of Commander, Sherby remained in charge of the Washington, D.C. Naval Militia through 1904. Through his responsibilities as commander both professionally and socially Hopkins came to know the senior military establishment of Washington intricately.\n\nThe law firm showed its unparalleled manipulative might when it single-handedly shaped Central American history in the following years. After a skirmish between Honduras and Guatemala in 1906, the two countries and El Salvador had concluded the so-called friendship pact that isolated Nicaragua. In the spring of 1907 Nicaragua invaded Honduras in an attempt to unseat President Manuel Bonilla, a puppet of United Fruit Company. With the help of U.S. marines the Honduran leader survived. Virtually a protectorate of the United States with marines occupying Bluefields on the Atlantic side of the country, Nicaragua invaded Honduras in 1908 to install a new, less hostile government there. Despite the official support for intervention of the U.S. government, Hopkins and his international clients worked behind the scenes to contain the Nicaraguan Dictator José Santos Zelaya. The weapon of choice was to provide money for neighboring countries such as Honduras and Guatemala while denying finance to Zelaya. After years of effort, Nicaragua had finally concluded a loan for 1.25 million pounds Sterling (over $100 Million in today's value) from the Ethelburg Syndicate in London in 1909. Hopkins and Hopkins signed Ethelburg as their client and promptly succeeded in canceling the loan. Apparently, Hopkins leaked crucial information on the impending U.S. intervention to unseat Zelaya to Otto Fuerth, a director of Ethelburg. The loan was cancelled and Zelaya gave up before the Marines landed. Hopkins testified in 1920: \"I imparted the information to a friend of mine named Otto Fuerth, whom I had known for a number of years and who had vital interests in that Republic, and I did not want to see him make a loss, and I gave him a little quiet information.\" While Hopkins and his clients worked with the American government to unseat Zelaya, American mercenaries, the likes of Sam Dreben, Tracy Richardson, Tex O'Reilly, and Emil Lewis Holmdahl, together with forces from Guatemala and Honduras attacked Nicaragua full scale. Everyone expected an imminent invasion of the country by U.S. forces. As Hopkins managed to cancel the loan and American mercenaries began attacking the capital of Managua, the Nicaraguan dictator left.\n\nHopkins' involvement in the Nicaraguan change of government was critical. He represented his clients and acted on behalf of the U.S. government, especially Philander Knox who had become Secretary of State in 1909. Hopkins also supported Knox's efforts to properly finance and equip the rebel forces. Guatemalan President and another puppet of the United Fruit Company, Manuel Estrada Cabrera, received funds from the United States, mainly in the form of loans. The banana fleets of United Fruit and Pierce transported weapons and ammunition to the Central American republics. The main U.S. port from where tramp steamers sailed was New Orleans, a hot bed for mercenaries, revolutionaries, and intrigue of all kind. After Zelaya fled, the U.S. government installed a new puppet regime. \"I knew exactly what was going to happen. I knew that nothing could save Zelaya,\" Hopkins boasted to Senator Smith in 1912. Upon the question of whether Hopkins' intimate information about Nicaragua's troubles came from sources in the government, he replied: \"I should not say directly from our Government, Senator. I knew what was going to happen before our Government did, and stopped Zelaya's loan from going through. I am also free to say that I received a great many hints that things were going to happen. I knew the sentiment in the State Department and elsewhere …\"\n\nHopkins' obvious success and experience in Central America in the decade prior to the Mexican Revolution made him the prime candidate to orchestrate a successful uprising for Francisco I. Madero and American high finance. On the one hand, American investors, especially Hopkins' client Henry Clay Pierce, wanted to unseat British oil tycoon Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray and his Científico puppets. On the other hand, the Maderistas needed finance and political support from the highest echelons of the U.S. government. Hopkins's task was to bring these interests together. According to Hopkins, Gustavo A. Madero and his father Francisco Madero Sr. met with him sometime in October 1910 in the Hotel Astor in New York. They made a deal. Hopkins received a retainer of $50,000 (over $1 million in today's money) payable upon successful completion of Diaz' overthrow. Since that day in New York, according to Hopkins, he had been in \"almost daily\" contact with Madero's brother, preparing the revolution. What exactly this responsibility entailed, Hopkins did not elaborate on. Clearly, there were only three areas in which work was required: Procuring loans to finance arms and ammunition purchases; building an organization for the revolutionaries that procured and shipped arms and ammunition; and creating political support in the United States for the rebellion. Showing how much his connections were worth, Hopkins successfully interceded with his friend, Secretary of State Philander Knox, to allow munitions to pass unchallenged from El Paso to Ciudad Juárez to aid revolutionaries.\n\nOnce the Maderos apparently put the well-connected lawyer in charge of the U.S. representation of their efforts, Hopkins had to find personnel quickly. The success of Madero's uprising depended on immediate financing, munitions shipments, and political support in Washington. Historians emphasize Madero's efforts to democratize Mexico and to institute meaningful social reforms, but often do not mention the Madero connection to U.S. interests. There is no hard evidence to suggest that the Maderos did anything other than what they could to advance their own goals. Henry Clay Pierce thought that as president Madero would create a more favorable political environment for his corporate interests than Díaz, so that he supported him. Even without any additional concessions, Pierce and the other U.S. magnates were not idealists. They faced an increasingly impossible work environment under Díaz, since, at the very least, in 1910 at 80 years old Díaz would not likely not last much longer in office and the presidential succession was unclear. When Senator Gilbert Hitchcock asked Hopkins whether his engagement in Mexico was for \"any idealistic purpose,\" the answer defined the reality: \"Of course not altogether, Senator.\"\n\nA representative of the Maderos and other governments, representing at the same time the Flint and Pierce interests, Hopkins also worked as an informant for the Military Intelligence Division of the US Army. However, the M.I.D. did not entirely trust him. When Hopkins determined that intelligence could be given without hurting the interests of his clients, it was reliable and valuable. Otherwise, he would not impart intelligence to the American government. His contacts in the M.I.D. hierarchy are also interesting. Not a single document could be found where Hopkins corresponded with Colonel Van Deman, the de facto head of the M.I.D. for many years. Hopkins corresponded with people much higher up in the chain of command, usually with the Secretary of War and his Chiefs of Staff. As a result, it appears more often than not that lower tier staff did not know him. From the evaluations of his M.I.D. handlers it becomes clear that they recognized the essence of his value. Informed like no-one else, Hopkins had to be handled with one caveat aptly defined in 1920 by Major Montague of the Military Intelligence Division. \"His loyalty shifts with his fee,\" he cautioned his superiors.\n\nOn Sunday, June 28, 1914, an exposé with wide-ranging consequences exploded on the first page of the \"New York Herald\". A break-in of Hopkins' office in Washington, D.C. netted burglars correspondence between the Hopkins' firm, the U.S. government, and the leader of the Constitutionalist forces, led by Venustiano Carranza. The details of the scandal were so significant that the details competed for first page headlines with the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife on the same day. The scandal had its origin just around the beginning of May, the time when Felix A. Sommerfeld and Hopkins shuttled between New York and Washington, trying to sideline Carranza, and arranging the finance for the final push against President Huerta. According to Sherburne Hopkins, burglars entered his Washington D.C. offices at the Hibbs building on 725 15th Street, NW in the middle of the night and \"stole a mass of correspondence from his desk.\" He suspected the burglars to be \"Cientificos,\" people who wanted to turn the clock back to Porfirio Diaz' times. Hopkins denied knowing who in particular was to blame for the heist, but \"had certain parties under suspicion.\" Clearly, he was implicating Huerta agents in the crime. Despite the break-in and removal of not a few but hundreds of files from his office, Hopkins did not file a police report.\n\nHundreds of letters between Hopkins, Carranza, Flint, and Pierce told a story of foreign interests using the Constitutionalists for their own ends. The letters seemed to indicate that the whole revolution had become a competition between Lord Cowdray and Henry Clay Pierce. The Hopkins papers revealed the extent to which American investors fronted by Pierce and Flint had been involved in the Mexican Revolution. Not much of the overall story should have been a surprise. For years American newspapers had reported on the financial dealings of the Maderos with Wall Street. When after President Madero's murder the rest of the family fled to the U.S., their support for Carranza was public knowledge. However, what made the Hopkins papers so combustible was the undeniable link between major parts of the U.S. government, oil and railroad interests headed by Flint and Pierce, and certain factions within the Constitutionalists headed by Carranza and Pancho Villa. The appearance of impropriety was undeniable. As late as April 1914, President Wilson's special envoy to Mexico, John Lind, negotiated with Hopkins and Carranza with regards to the Niagara Falls peace conference, convened to negotiate the U.S. exit from Mexico.\n\nThe exposé suggested also a second, less favorable picture of the Carranza government. The mere fact of Carranza corresponding freely with Hopkins and Pierce seemed to suggest that Carranza was willing to sell Mexico's infrastructure and natural resources to American finance if they helped him win the revolution. In a sense, these revelations threatened to reduce Carranza to the level of Porfirio Díaz whose sell-out had precipitated the revolution. Carranza would not let this stand and quickly issued a categorical denial of his government ever having accepted any financing from U.S. interests. Hopkins, Pierce, Flint, Carranza, Luis Cabrera Lobato, José Vasconcelos, Lind, Lindley Miller Garrison, and William Jennings Bryan all voiced public denials of ever having known anyone or dealt with anyone of the group. Only two parties smiled through the show: Senators Smith and Fall who loved to see the Wilson administration tumble, and Huerta's representatives in Niagara who only had to gain from the revelations.\n\nAs the Republican Senators William Alden Smith and Albert Bacon Fall correctly assumed, Hopkins had driven a deep wedge of suspicion between President Wilson and his Secretaries William Jennings Bryan and Lindley Miller Garrison. The latter even publicly announced that he never met or dealt with Hopkins, which clearly was untrue. Both cabinet members surreptitiously relented on the arms embargo against Mexico, while publicly proclaiming its enforcement.\n\nThe Carranza scandal devastated Hopkins' public image. He remained a solid soldier for the interests of Pierce and Flint, however, further in the background. His political clout had been on decline throughout the spring of 1914 and finally ended with the exposé of his stolen papers on June 28. In a larger sense, the Hopkins papers confirmed to the American public and international observers alike just how deep the machinations of American finance reached into U.S. foreign policy and Mexican affairs. Suddenly, all the rumors and suspicions voiced for years in newspapers and Senate investigations lay on public display as fact. Hopkins' carefully crafted lobbying schemes, his financing of select revolutionary factions in Mexico, the pushing of his clients' interests while hurting their competitors, and his intricate network of whole layers of government that operated on a system of favors – all of it had broken to pieces. After the scandal, Hopkins remained in the background. His protégé Felix A. Sommerfeld took the public stage. Throughout the coming world war, Hopkins gave information to the American government when asked. Off and on between 1914 and 1918, he acted as an informant and filed reports with the U.S. Military Intelligence Division. His influence on the Mexican Revolution never reached the heights of 1913 and 1914. When Pancho Villa self-destructed on the battlefield a year later, Hopkins had already faded into the background. He supported Villa's resurgence a few years later and supported the rise of Adolfo de la Huerta in the 1920s. When Hopkins died on June 22, 1932, \"The New York Times\" ran an obituary of the Washington lawyer who had revolutionary chieftains move at his behest like marionettes. Despite the anticlimactic ending, Hopkins' influence of American foreign policy towards Latin America and his influence on the Mexican Revolution are profound. As an MID agent remarked after World War I, \"Hopkins has forgotten more about Mexico than any other American will ever learn.\"\n"}

{"id": "31596923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31596923", "title": "Women in Israel", "text": "Women in Israel\n\nWomen in Israel are women who live in or who are from the State of Israel, established in 1948. Israel does not have a constitution, but the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: “The State of Israel (…) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.”\n\nIsraeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages, and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women. In 2012, Israel ranked eleventh out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. In the same survey, Israel was ranked 24th for the proportion of women serving in executive positions.\n\nEven before the state of Israel was created, there were women fighting for women's rights in the land that became the state of Israel, for example women in the New Yishuv. Yishuv is the term referring to the body of Jewish residents in Palestine before the establishment of the state of Israel, and New Yishuv refers to those who began building homes outside the Old City walls of Jerusalem in the 1860s. In 1919 the first nationwide women's party in the New Yishuv (the Union of Hebrew Women for Equal Rights in Eretz Israel) was created, and Rosa Welt-Straus, who had immigrated there that year, was appointed its leader, as which she continued until her death. In 1926 the haredim, who preferred not to face the possibility of a plebiscite, left the yishuv's Assembly of Representatives, and that year an official declaration was made (ratified by the mandate government in 1927) confirming \"equal rights to women in all aspects of life in the yishuv - civil, political, and economic.\"\n\nIsrael was the third country in the world to be led by a female prime minister, Golda Meir, and in 2010, women's parliamentary representation in Israel was 18 percent, which is above the Arab world's average of 6 percent and equals that of the U.S. Congress. Still, it trails far behind the Scandinavian countries' 40 percent average\n\nThe Israeli parliament, The Knesset, has established “The Committee on the Status of Women,” to address women’s rights. The stated objectives of this committee are to prevent discrimination, combat violence against women, and promote equality in politics, lifecycle events and education. In 1998, the Knesset passed a law for \"Prevention of Sexual Harassment\".\n\nIn 2013, the Minister of Religious Affairs and Chief Rabbis issued statements telling ritual bath attendants only to inspect women who want inspection, putting an end to forced inspections of women at mikvehs.\n\nIn 2018, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in Israel to accept the Genesis Lifetime Achievement award, lamented the segregation of women in Israel at public universities, likening the practice to discriminatory \"separate but equal\" laws once applied to blacks in the United States. \n\nSince the establishment of the state, Israeli law gives jurisdiction for matters of personal status for Jews, including marriage and divorce, to the rabbinical courts.\n\nIn 1947 David Ben-Gurion agreed that the authority in matters of marriage and divorce of persons registering as Jews would be invested in the hands of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and an agreement was signed stating that (among other matters), known as the \"status quo letter.\" In 1953 the Knesset enacted the Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage and Divorce) Law, 5713 – 1953. Section 1 of the Law states, \"Matters of marriage and divorce of Jews in Israel, being citizens or residents of the State, shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts.\" The substantive provision of section 2 of this Law further states: \"Marriages and divorces of Jews shall be performed in Israel in accordance with Jewish religious law\" (din torah).\n\nIn the rabbinical courts, which operate according to \"halakha\" (Torah law), a Jewish woman is allowed to initiate divorce proceedings, but her husband must give his consent to make the divorce final. If the husband disappears or refuses to grant the divorce, the wife is considered an \"agunah\" (lit. \"chained woman\") and may not remarry or give birth to \"halakhically\" legitimate children. Rabbinical tribunals may, and sometimes do, sanction a husband who refused divorce, but still do not grant a divorce without his consent.\n\nSimilarly, a Muslim man is privileged to divorce his wife without her consent and without petitioning the court. Unless a Muslim woman has a marriage contract providing for circumstances in which she may obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, she can only petition for divorce through the Sharia courts, and if her husband elects to withhold consent, she is denied a divorce absent certain conditions, and when these too are lacking she becomes a chained woman, prevented from moving forward with her life based solely on her gender.\n\nChristians in Israel may seek official separations or divorces only through the ecclesiastical courts of the denomination to which they belong. Gender discrimination in such courts is not so rigid or codified as under Sharia or orthodox rabbinical rules.\n\nIn 2010, Israel passed the Civil Union Law, allowing a few couples to marry and divorce civilly in Israel, with men and women enjoying equal rights The Civil Union Law extends this right to only the very small minority of couples in which neither person is registered as a member of any religion. A poll conducted by Tel Aviv University in 2009 revealed that 65% of the Jewish Israeli community supported the availability of civil, gender-neutral marriage, even though 70% of those polled expressed that a religious ceremony was still personally important for their own wedding.\n\nIn 2015 Tzohar (a Religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the Israeli Bar Association, introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a get; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation.\n\nIn 2018 the Knesset passed a law, slated to remain in effect for three years, allowing Israel’s rabbinical courts to handle certain cases of Jewish women wishing to divorce their Jewish husbands, even if neither the wife nor the husband is an Israeli citizen.\n\nSince the founding of the State of Israel, relatively few women have served in the Israeli government, and fewer still have served in the leading ministerial offices. While \nIsrael is one of a small number of countries where a woman—Golda Meir—has served as Prime Minister, it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government.\n\nAlthough the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: “The State of Israel (…) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex,” the Haredi political parties (Shas and United Torah Judaism) have never allowed women on their lists for Knesset elections. However, in December 2014, women activists in the Haredi community have threatened a boycott of Haredi parties in upcoming elections if women are not included in election slates.\n\n, women comprised 26.7% of Israel's 120-member Knesset, placing it 54th of 185 countries in which women are included in the legislature. For comparison, the female ratio in Scandinavia is over 40%, the European Union average is 17.6%, while in the Arab world it is 6.4%.\nFemale representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few have come from religious Jewish or Arab parties.\n\nIn January 1986 Israeli female teacher Leah Shakdiel was granted membership in the religious council of Yeruham, but the Minister of Religious Affairs Zvulun Hammer canceled her membership on the grounds that women should not serve in that capacity. In early 1987 a petition was submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court regarding this incident. The Supreme Court precedent-setting ruling was unanimously accepted in Shakdiel's favor, and in 1988 Shakdiel became the first woman in Israel to serve in a religious council.\n\nIn 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called \"U'Bizchutan: Haredi Women Making Change.\"\n\nIsrael is one of the few countries in the world with a mandatory military service requirement for women. Women have taken part in Israel’s military before and since the founding of the state in 1948, with women currently comprising 33% of all IDF soldiers and 51% of its officers, fulfilling various roles within the Ground, Navy and Air Forces. The 2000 Equality amendment to the Military Service law states that \"The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men.\" 88% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates, while women can be found in 69% of all positions.\n\nOn November 8, 1995, while she was a student of aeronautics at the Technion as part of the academic reserve, Alice Miller appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court after being turned down for the pilot selection phase in the Israeli Air Force flight academy. Following her appeal, Israeli president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, made chauvinistic comments that ridiculed the idea of women as fighter pilots: \"Listen maideleh, have you ever seen a man knitting socks? Have you ever seen a female surgeon or a female being a conductor of an orchestra? Women are not able to withstand the pressures required for fighter pilots.\" The Israeli Supreme Court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller did not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in the IDF. Following the petition, formerly all-male military units began accepting women, including the Israeli Air Force flight academy, the Israeli navy officers' course, various artillery courses, the Israeli air defense and the Israeli Border Police. The Equality Amendment to the Military Service law, enacted in January 2000, completed the Supreme Court ruling as it defined the right of female soldiers to volunteer for combat professions. This law stated that \"The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men.\" The amendment drafted by female lawmakers granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. The question of who and what was \"suitable\" was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis.\nWomen began to apply for combat support and light combat roles in the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. The Caracal Battalion was formed which allowed men and women to serve together in light infantry. Many women joined the Border Police. Many Israeli women were accepted to the pilot selection phase in the Israeli Air Force flight academy some completed it successfully. The first female jet fighter pilot, Roni Zuckerman, received her wings in 2001. By 2006, the first female pilots and navigators graduated from the IAF training course, and several hundred women entered combat units, primarily in support roles, like intelligence gatherers, instructors, social workers, medics and engineers. When the Second Lebanon War broke out, women took part in field operations alongside men. Airborne helicopter engineer Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Keren Tendler was the first female IDF combat soldier to be killed in action. In November 2007 the Air Force appointed its first woman deputy squadron commander.\n\nNevertheless, there are still positions in the IDF that are off limits to women. In 2003 Yaara Stolberg filed a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court against the IDF's decision not to allow women to serve in the Machbet anti-aircraft unit. About six months after Stolberg completed her two-year mandatory military service, the court denied the petition, stating it has become \"irrelevant and theoretical\".\n\nOn 23 June 2011, Orna Barbivai became the first female Major-General in the IDF upon her promotion to the role of commander of the Manpower Directorate. She is the second woman to serve on the General Staff.\n\nIn response to several incidents where Orthodox Jewish soldiers objected to women singing during military ceremonies, the IDF Chief of Staff's office ruled that soldiers may not walk out of military assemblies to protest women singing, but may request to be excused from cultural events on those grounds. In October 2011, female soldiers were asked to leave an official event marking the end of the Simhat Torah holiday and dance in a separate area. In November 2011, 19 retired generals sent a letter to Defense Minister Ehud Barak and IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, urging them not to cave in to the demands of religious soldiers.\n\nIn 2013, Israel's attorney general, Yehuda Weinstein, advised ministers across the government to end gender segregation in public spaces. If implemented, the guidelines would change many aspects of daily life in Israel, where gender segregation is allowed on buses, at funerals, in health care and on radio airwaves. The attorney general's guidelines, however, are non-binding.\n\nIn Orthodox Judaism, there are certain situations in which gender separation is practiced for religious and social reasons, with strict rules on mingling of men and women. Before they were banned in 2011, Mehadrin bus lines operated along routes with large Haredi populations, with seats in the front reserved for men passengers. In 2006, Miriam Shear, an American Jewish woman, claims she was attacked by ultra-Orthodox men after refusing to move to the back of the bus on a non-segregated line. Critics likened the “mehadrin” lines to racial segregation in the United States, with Shear compared to African American icon Rosa Parks. In July 2004, American-Israeli novelist Naomi Ragen claims she was bullied for refusing to move to the back of the bus.\n\nThe Jewish Daily Forward noted that gender segregation has been a tradition in Israel and is actually on the rise, now encompassing gender segregated elevators in some places. In parts of Jerusalem where ultra-Orthodox live, advertisements and billboard do not have pictures of women, and some supermarkets have different hours for men to shop than women. Some clinics also have separate hours for men and women.\n\nSimilar problems with gender segregation have surfaced on airlines such as El Al, where ultra-Orthodox male passengers have pressured females to move, and planes have been delayed as a result. The New York Times interviewed Anat Hoffman on the phenomenon of ultra-Orthodox males asking female passengers on airlines to move, noting that IRAC had started a campaign urging Israeli women not to give up their seats. “I have a hundred stories,” said Hoffman.\n\nControversy has also been created by discrimination against women in public spaces. Women of the Wall have fought for the right of women to pray in their fashion at the Western Wall, including wearing prayer shawls, singing and conducting priestly blessings by daughters of the priestly caste. Women have also been denied the right to sing at some public events, such as memorial services and in the Knesset. The controversy focuses on whether \"forbidding women to sing is an insulting act of unacceptable discrimination, or a gesture of sensitivity and consideration to Orthodox Jewish men who believe that listening to a woman’s singing voice is, for them, a violation of religious law. \" Some believe such policies endorse religious fundamentalism and silence women or restrict their freedom in the public arena.\n\nIn 2016, women protested that they had been discriminated against in Holocaust Remembrance Day observance. Bar-Ilan University, for example, announced it would allow women to read passages of text and play musical instruments at its Holocaust Remembrance Day, but would bar women from singing in order not to offend Orthodox Jewish males. The city of Sderot also limited women's singing at public events to appease religious males. Other organizations, such as Ne’emanei Torah V’Avodah (NTA), protested that it is an Israeli custom to sing at national ceremonies and that extreme Jewish religious law should not be imposed on the general public.\n\nIn 2017, the Jerusalem Magistrates Court ruled that employees of airlines could not request female passengers change their seats just because men wish them to.\n\nVigilante \"modesty patrols\" have harassed women perceived as immodestly dressed in Haredi neighborhoods. In 2010, police arrested two Haredi men at the Western Wall plaza on suspicion that they threw chairs at a Women of the Wall group that was praying aloud at the site. On September 28, 2010, the Israeli Supreme Court outlawed public gender segregation in Jerusalem's Mea Shearim neighborhood in response to a petition submitted after extremist Haredi men physically and verbally assaulted women for walking on a designated men's only road.\n\nRape, including spousal rape, is a felony in Israel, punishable by 16 years in prison. The law doubles the penalty if the perpetrator assaults or rapes a relative. There are nine rape crisis centers that operate a 24-hour crisis line for victims to sexual violence. The Israeli Ministry of Social Affairs operates a battered women's shelter and an abuse reporting hotline. The police operates a call center to inform victims about their cases. Women's organizations provided counseling, crisis intervention, legal assistance, and shelters.\n\nA major motivation for homicide in Israel is violence against women (including honor killings in Muslim families). Several honor killings occur yearly in Israel within the Israeli Arab community.\n\nThe indictment and conviction of former president Moshe Katsav for two counts of rape and other charges was interpreted as a victory for women. Rape crisis centers received record number of calls following the verdict.\n\nSexual harassment is illegal but remains widespread. The law requires that suspected victims be informed of their right to assistance. Penalties for sexual harassment depend on the severity of the act and whether blackmail is involved; range from two to nine years' imprisonment.\n\nThe 1998 Israeli Sexual Harassment Law interprets sexual harassment broadly, and prohibits the behavior as a discriminatory practice, a restriction of liberty, an offence to human dignity, a violation of every person's right to elementary respect, and an infringement of the right to privacy. Additionally, the law prohibits intimidation or retaliation that accommodates sexual harassment. Intimidation or retaliation thus related to sexual harassment are defined by the law as \"prejudicial treatment\".\n\nAccording to a survey by the Ministry of Industry published in 2010, 35 to 40 percent of women reported experiencing sexual harassment at work, one-third of whom experienced it in the previous 12 months. Among the women who reported harassment, 69 percent said they had received \"proposals,\" 47 percent reported comments of a sexual nature, 22 percent cited physical violation, 10 percent reported humiliation, and 7.7 percent reported extortion and threats.\n\nIsrael, in accordance with Western ethics, has made polygamy illegal. Provisions were instituted to allow for existing polygamous families immigrating from countries where the practice was legal.\n\n, the maternal mortality rate in the country was 7 per 100,000 births, one of the lowest in the world. Women and men were given equal access to diagnostic services and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nAn IMD survey published in 2012 ranked Israel in eleventh place out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. In the same survey, Israel was ranked 24th for the proportion of women serving in executive positions. Israeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women. The OECD reported in 2016 that income disparity between men in women in Israel is particularly high compared with other countries in the OECD. On average, men in Israel make 22 percent more than women, which places Israel among the four OECD (behind Japan, Estonia, and South Korea) with the highest wage inequality between men and women. The OECD average stands at 15 percent.\n\nThe government enacted a number of programs to improve the status of women in the work place and society. The Authority for the Advancement of the Status of Women in the Prime Minister's Office grants scholarships for higher education for Druze, Bedouin, and Circassian female students in the country north. The authority holds professional training courses in Arab, Druze, and Circassian localities.\n\nIn 2013, Malka Schaps became the first female Haredi dean at an Israeli university when she was appointed dean of Bar Ilan University's Faculty of Exact Sciences.\n\nAlso in 2013, Israel’s Chief Rabbinate promised to remove the obstacles preventing women from working as supervisors in the state kosher certification system, and Emunah announced the first supervisor certification course for women in Israel.\n\nIn 2016 it was announced that the High Court of Justice had given the Justice Ministry 30 days to formulate new regulations to allow women to compete equally with men for the position of director of rabbinical courts.\n\nNa'amat () is the largest Israeli women's organization, founded in 1921. It has a membership of 800,000 women, (Jews, Arabs, Druze and Circassians) representing the entire spectrum of Israeli society. The organization has 100 branches in cities, towns and settlements all over the country. It also has sister organizations in other countries whose members are part of the World Labour Zionist Movement and the World Zionist Organization.\nThe Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel is a leading organisation in fighting violence against women.\n\n\n"}
