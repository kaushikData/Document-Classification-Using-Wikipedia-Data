His devotion to Arab nationalism dated to the days of the Committee of Union and Progress and its \"Turkification\" policies. He supported the Arab Revolt during World War I and briefly headed the foreign ministry under Emir Faisal.\n\nWhen France occupied Syria in July 1920 he fled the country. Shahbandar returned in 1921 and organized the Iron Hand Society to agitate against French rule. This was the first nationalist group to emerge in Damascus during the Mandate and Shahbandar organized its spread to Homs and Hama. In April 1922, the French arrested him and other Iron Hand leaders for incitement against their rule. The arrests triggered several days of demonstrations and bloody confrontation between protesters and French forces in Damascus. Nonetheless, the French tried Shahbandar for subversive activities and sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment.\n\nAfter serving 1½ years of his sentence the French sent him into exile where he joined the activities of the Syrian-Palestine Congress based in Cairo. The French allowed him to return to Syria in 1924. The following year Shahbandar guided the formation of Syria's first nationalist party, the People's Party. He then helped organize the spread of the Syrian Revolution from Jabal Druze to the rest of Syria. He eluded the French authorities and moved to Jabal Druze for the duration of the revolt. There he and Sultan al-Atrash formed a provisional government. When the revolt collapsed in 1927 Shahbandar fled to Transjordan and from there to Egypt.\n\nIn 1937 a French amnesty allowed him to return from exile and he directed his supporters to oppose the Franco-Syrian Treaty on the grounds that it granted France privileges that detracted from Syrian sovereignty. He was joined by powerful Syrian politicians such as Munir al-Ajlani. He also directed a political campaign to discredit the National Bloc government of Prime Minister Jamil Mardam Bey. During World War II the French considered cooperating with Shahbandar because of his opposition to the National Bloc and because of support for him from Britain and the Hashemites. In June 1940 he was assassinated in Damascus. The French accused several prominent National Bloc figures, including Jamil Mardam and Saadallah al-Jabiri, of plotting the murder and they fled to Iraq. While Shahbandar was one of Syria's most popular leaders he never built up an organization that would perpetuate his political legacy.\n\n"}

Upon his release from prison, he returned to crime and was killed by a hostage during a train robbery.\n\nKilpatrick was born in Coleman County, Texas, in 1874, the third of nine children of a Tennessee-born farmer, George Washington Kilpatrick (or \"Killpatrick\"), by his wife, Mary, a native of South Carolina, according to the 1880 Federal Census.\n\nHe worked as a cowboy for a time in Texas and became acquaintances with Tom and Sam Ketchum and Bill Carver.\n\nAfter Cassidy's release from prison, Lay and he organized the Wild Bunch gang, and the gang began the most successful train-robbing career in history.

Attempting a robbery, Kilpatrick held up the express messenger, David Trousdale, in the Wells Fargo baggage and mail car. While Kilpatrick looted the safe and any other valuables he could find, Trousdale managed to hide an ice mallet underneath the back of his jacket. Trousdale then told Kilpatrick that there was a valuable package lying on the ground. Kilpatrick rested his rifle against his leg while he leaned over to pick up the package. As he did, Trousdale pulled the mallet from beneath his coat and struck Kilpatrick three times in the back of the neck and head. Kilpatrick died instantly of a broken neck and crushed skull. The beating with the mallet was so brutal that Kilpatrick's brains stained the walls of the car.\n\n\nSoule, Arthur, \"The Tall Texan - The Story of Ben Kilpatrick\", Deer Lodge, Montana: TrailDust Publishing Inc., 1995\n\n"}

He later broke with President Leonid Kuchma, and became a foreign relations adviser to Viktor Yushchenko, the main opposition candidate in the 2004 presidential elections. After Ukraine's Orange Revolution, Tarasyuk became foreign minister again on 4 February 2005, and served in the Cabinets of Yulia Tymoshenko, Yuriy Yekhanurov, and Viktor Yanukovych. Tarasyuk favors Ukrainian integration with the European Union.\n\nTarasyuk was formally dismissed by the Verkhovna Rada on 1 December 2006. He disputed this dismissal in Kyiv Shevchenkivskyi District court, and on 5 December parliament's decision was reversed on the grounds that it violated Ukrainian law. On the same day, Yushchenko issued a decree that Tarasyuk must keep his job.\n\nDespite this court order and presidential decree, he was not allowed to enter cabinet meetings and this caused political conflict based on interpretations of amendments to Constitution.

Cape Verde is a \"sociedade mestiça\" (mestizo society; as described in Portuguese), which means that it is home to mixed-race people. Nearly all Cape Verdeans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries.\n\nThe Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited when the Portuguese landed there in 1456. Slaves from adjacent West Africa were brought to the islands to work on Portuguese plantations. As a result, many Cape Verdeans are \"mulattoes\" (\"mestiços\" in Portuguese), having biracial origins. European ancestors also include Spanish and Italian seamen who were granted land by the Portuguese Empire, followed by Portuguese settlers, exiles, and Portuguese Jews who were victims of the Inquisition. Many foreigners from other parts of the world settled in Cape Verde as their permanent country. Most of them were Dutch, French, British (English), Arab and Jewish (from Lebanon and Morocco).\n\nA genetic study revealed that the ancestry of the population in Cape Verde is predominantly European in the male line and West African in the female line; counted together the percentage is 56% West African and 44% European.\n\nPrior to independence in 1975, many thousands of people emigrated from drought-stricken Portuguese Cape Verde, formerly an overseas province of Portugal. Because these people arrived using their Portuguese passports, they were registered as Portuguese immigrants by the authorities. Today, more Cape Verdeans live abroad than in Cape Verde itself, with significant emigrant Cape Verdean communities in Brazil and in the United States (102,000 of Cape Verdeans descent in the U.S., with a major concentration on the New England coast from Providence, Rhode Island, to New Bedford, Massachusetts).\nIn 2008, Portugal’s National Statistics Institute estimated that there were 68,145 Cape Verdeans who legally resided in Portugal. This made up \"15.7% of all foreign nationals living legally in the country.\" \n\nCape Verde's official language is Portuguese. It is the language of instruction and government.\n\nCape Verdean Creole is used colloquially, and is the mother tongue of virtually all Cape Verdeans. Cape Verdean Creole or \"Kriolu\" is a dialect continuum of a Portuguese-based creole. There is a substantial body of literature in Creole, especially in the Santiago Creole and the São Vicente Creole. Creole has been gaining prestige since the nation's independence from Portugal.\n\nMore than 93% of the population of Cape Verde is nominally Roman Catholic, according to an informal poll taken by local churches. About 5% of the population is Protestant. The largest Protestant denomination is the Church of the Nazarene. \n\nOther religious groups include the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), the Assemblies of God, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the New Apostolic Church, and various other Pentecostal and evangelical groups. There are also small Bahá'í communities and a small Muslim community. The number of atheists is estimated at less than 1 percent of the population.\n\nThe culture of Cape Verde reflects its mixed West African and Portuguese roots. It is well known for its diverse forms of music such as \"Morna\", and a wide variety of dances: the soft dance \"Morna\", the \"Funaná\", the extreme sensuality of \"coladeira\", and the \"Batuque\" dance. These are reflective of the diverse origins of Cape Verde's residents. The term \"Criolo\", or also \"Kriolu\" is used to refer to residents as well as the culture of Cape Verde.\n\n"}

He is visited by Michael Corleone on the advice of Don Tommasino, and Michael tells him of his swindle at the hands of corrupt Vatican bank officials Frederick Keinszig, Licio Lucchesi, and Archbishop Gilday. Lamberto encourages Michael to confess his sins; Michael is initially reluctant, but eventually gives in under the Cardinal's gentle prodding. He breaks down in tears when confessing that he ordered the murder of his brother Fredo. Upon the conclusion of the confession, Lamberto tells Michael that he deserves to suffer for his terrible sins, yet absolves him and tells him he still has a chance for redemption.\n\nUpon the death of Paul VI, Lamberto is elected the new Pontiff; he takes the name John Paul I upon his accession. A moral, thoroughly honest man, he immediately calls for an investigation into the activities of the Vatican Bank and requests a meeting with Keinszig, the Bank's chief accountant. However, Keinszig has left Rome with a large sum of money and several documents. Fearing that their corruption will be exposed, Keinszig, Lucchesi, and Gilday plot to murder the Pope. Gilday poisons the Pontiff's tea, killing him in his sleep.\n\nThe character of Lamberto and the film's depiction of the events which led to his murder are based upon one of the conspiracy theories surrounding the sudden death of the real-life Pope John Paul I, Albino Luciani. Like the Lamberto character, Luciani was discovered dead in his bed in 1978, 33 days after his election to the papacy. Various theories, such as the one outlined in David Yallop's 1984 book, \"In God's Name\", have suggested that Luciani was murdered because he was investigating and planning reforms for the Vatican Bank, in light of the Banco Ambrosiano scandal.\n\n"}

The split arose from disputes within the group over the role of female leadership. Emanuel demanded to be recognised as co-founder of the church. This was viewed by Orimolade, who denied she was co-founder, as insubordination, and led to their eventual split. This was followed by other schisms, leading to the existence of more than 10 separate sects within the Cherubim and Seraphim.\n\nAfter Orimolade's death, Emanuel campaigned to be recognised as the supreme head of the church, claiming she had been discriminated against as a woman.

He was one of the members of the intelligence agency-led 'Clockwork Orange' project, alleged to have been an attempt to smear various individuals including a number of senior British politicians in the early 1970s. He also attempted to draw public attention to the Kincora Boys' Home sexual abuse scandal several years before the Royal Ulster Constabulary finally intervened.\n\nHe was wrongly convicted of manslaughter in 1981, for which he spent six years in gaol, until 1987. The conviction was later quashed in the light of new forensic and other evidence that raised serious questions about the dubious nature of the evidence used to convict Wallace initially. The journalist Paul Foot, in his book \"Who Framed Colin Wallace?\", suggested that Wallace may have been framed for the killing, possibly to discredit the allegations he was making. This view was similarly expressed by Alex Carlile QC (now Lord Carlile), who later speculated that this may have been the motive not just for the alleged frameup, but also for murder.\n\nWallace was born in Randalstown, Northern Ireland, in 1943 and educated at Ballymena Academy. He was commissioned into the Territorial Army in 1961, and later became a marksman in the Ulster Special Constabulary, or 'B Specials'. A former cadet officer in the Irish Guards, he was commissioned in 1972 into the Ulster Defence Regiment, part of the Regular Army, and was immediately granted the rank of captain. He became the Regiment's Psychological Operations officer. He was seconded to the New Zealand SAS before working for the British Intelligence Corps as a psychological warfare officer. During the early 1970s he ran the British Army's free-fall parachute display team in Northern Ireland, taking part in a variety of 'Hearts and Minds' projects throughout the region. Several members of that team were also members of the Special Air Service (SAS) or the Intelligence Corps. In 1969, \"The Irish Guards Association Journal\" carried this reference to Wallace: \"He is a great training enthusiast and is never happier than when he is on top of one 3,000-foot peak busily engaged in plotting his hop to the next one. He will eventually achieve great fame as he will, no doubt, be the first Brigade officer to visit RHQ without getting salute at the main gate - as knowing him, he will surely parachute in.\"\n\nWallace joined the Ministry of Defence on 15 March 1968 as an assistant information officer for the British Army at its Northern Ireland headquarters at Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn. He became an established information officer from 14 December 1971, and a senior information officer with effect from 27 September 1974, having first held this latter post on temporary promotion from 1972.\n\nAs well as carrying out overt information work for the British Army, Wallace was also working for 14 Intelligence Company as a member of the ultra-secret Army Psychological Operations unit (Information Policy), covertly attempting to undermine, disrupt and control paramilitary groups.\n\nIn the years following his appointment to the Information Policy unit, Wallace received high praise from the senior staff at Thiepval. In 1971, his Annual Confidential Report concluded: 'This is an officer of the highest calibre. Totally dedicated to the Army, he demonstrates this by a devotion to duty that is truly remarkable.' The counter-signing officer scribbled underneath: 'I heartily agree.' In 1972, the Chief of Staff recorded that enthusiasm and dedication were not his only virtues. His abilities were just as remarkable: 'Continues to demonstrate that his talents are of the very highest standard.' Wallace's former boss, Major Tony Staughton, confirmed that by 1973 he had twice recommended Wallace for the MBE, and could not understand how and why the recommendations were turned down. \"I've never known such a deserving case,\" he told journalist Paul Foot.\n\nIn 1973 and 1974 Wallace was involved with an operation called Clockwork Orange. Wallace alleges that this involved right-wing members of the security services in a disinformation campaign aimed not at paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland, but at British MPs. He was supported by a covert specialist military troop (possibly an SAS unit made up of specially-trained Northern Ireland personnel). This group was shrouded in secrecy. Journalists from foreign news organisations would be given briefings and shown forged documents, which purported to show that politicians were speaking at Irish republican rallies or were receiving secret deposits in Swiss bank accounts.\n\nOn 16 March 1976 the British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, retired suddenly without any apparent reason. In the days leading up to his resignation there had been no hint that he was about to go. Two months later, on 12 May, Wilson invited two BBC reporters, Barrie Penrose and Roger Courtiour to visit him at his home at 5 North Street, near Parliament. He told the reporters that he believed members of MI5 had been involved in a plot to undermine his Government. He said that he had called in the head of MI6, Sir Maurice Oldfield, who told him that there was a section of MI5 that \"was unreliable\" and that he (Oldfield) was \"going to bring it out\". Wilson also said that he had called in the head of MI5, Sir Michael Hanley, who confirmed the existence within his Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right-wing views. Later, the two reporters interviewed Sir Michael Hanley at his home and asked him if there had been talk of a coup to overthrow the Wilson Government in the mid 1970s. The former Head of MI5 replied: \"I think it is generally accepted. Yes\".\n\nOn 19 May 1976, \"The Daily Telegraph\" published a story under the headline: \"Campaign in US to smear MPs\". The story claimed that \"persistent efforts have been made in recent months to discredit leading members of the three major British political parties by planting derogatory stories about them in news agencies in Washington\". One of the news agencies to be given such information said: \"So far this year we have been offered similar matter about some eleven MPs, a Conservative, two Liberals and eight Labour\".\nIn his book, \"Spycatcher\", former senior MI5 officer, Peter Wright stated:\n\nThe information appears to bear a striking similarity to some of the material contained in the notes which Colin Wallace had been instructed two years earlier as part of the 'Clockwork Orange' project. People named in Colin Wallace's notes as having been targeted in this manner included Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, Merlyn Rees, Cyril Smith, Jeremy Thorpe, Tony Benn and Ian Paisley.\n\nOn 20 March 1975, Hugh Mooney, a member of the top secret Information Research Department run by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, wrote a memo to his superiors claiming that the former Head of Army Intelligence in Northern Ireland told him that Colin Wallace \"had been one of his best sources.\" MI5 accused Colin Wallace of leaking information to the press about William McGrath, the leader of the Loyalist paramilitary group Tara, who had been sexually abusing children at the Kincora Home. However, official records later showed that he had been instructed by his superiors to draw the attention of the press to McGrath's activities.\n\nMooney also gave an interview to the Sunday Correspondent on 18 March 1990 about Colin Wallace's attempts to expose the sexual abuse at Kincora. The Sunday Correspondent report said:\n\nWallace resigned from the Ministry of Defence in 1975 in order to avoid disciplinary action, ostensibly for privately briefing journalists with classified information. Wallace always claimed that this action was consistent with his secret job duties as a member of the Intelligence Services and that the real reasons for his dismissal were related to his refusal to continue working on the Clockwork Orange project in October 1974, and his exposure of a child abuse scandal at the Kincora Boys' Home. He claimed his allegations were blocked because the leading perpetrator was both a leading member of a loyalist paramilitary group and an undercover agent for MI5. The government later admitted that Wallace had the authority to take decisions on the release of classified information in support of psychological operations.\n\nIn the 1980s, to support his claims, Wallace produced a collection of documents, including a series of handwritten notes on material which formed part of the Clockwork Orange project. The notes were later subjected to an independent forensic analysis by Dr Julius Grant, and the results were consistent with the notes having been made contemporaneously during the 1970s.\n\nWallace was probably the first member of the security forces to attempt to draw public attention to the sexual abuse of children at the Kincora Boys' Home in Belfast. In 1973, at the request of his superior officers, he gave several journalists the name of the loyalist paramilitary leader running the home, together with his address and telephone number. He also pointed out that the man was \"a known homosexual.\" None of the newspapers he briefed published the story and the abuse of children continued unabated for a further seven years before the police were finally forced to take action following revelations in the \"Irish Independent\".\n\nSeveral commentators have pointed to the coincidence that the events which led to Wallace being wrongly convicted of manslaughter took place shortly after Kincora was finally exposed in the \"Irish Independent\".\n\nWriting in the \"New Statesman\" in 1986, Duncan Campbell revealed that, at about the time Wallace was charged with manslaughter, intelligence officers wrote to Sir Frank Cooper, Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence, warning him that \"Wallace had both the information and the motivation to reveal the story behind Kincora\".\n\nEntries in intelligence notebooks kept during 1974 by former Special Military Intelligence Unit Officer, Captain Fred Holroyd, who had met Colin Wallace in Northern Ireland at that time, refer to the Kincora hostel by name, and say of leading Protestant politicians that they are \"all queers\", as British Army and RUC intelligence officials had had no difficulty coupling information about homosexual Protestant extremist politicians to the Kincora hostel.\n\nHolroyd is also quoted as saying that, while being trained for his Northern Ireland duties, he was told that the Tara organisation was in effect controlled by British intelligence, and was not a real security threat, implying that William McGrath, a former house-father at Kincora and leader of Tara, had come under intelligence control before 1973.\n\nClive Ponting, a former senior official in the Ministry of Defence, told the \"Sunday Times\" that he had attended meetings with MI5 officers at the MOD to discuss how to prevent Wallace and Fred Holroyd from making allegations about 'dirty tricks' in Northern Ireland. Ponting said that MI5 were \"genuinely worried about what Wallace might say\".\n\nIn March 1987, a former MI5 agent, James Miller, told the Sunday Times that he knew Wallace when he was working in Northern Ireland during the 1970s. Miller said that his first task for MI5 was to spy on William McGrath. He said that his MI5 handler told him to leave McGrath to them (MI5) and he understood that they used his information to recruit McGrath as an informer.\" \n\nAfter the Kincora story was initially exposed in the press, the Northern Ireland Secretary, James Prior, asked Sir George Terry, the Chief Constable of the Sussex Police, to carry out an investigation into the affair. Terry's full report was never shown to Parliament. In a summary of the report, Terry said: \"Military sources have been frank, and I am satisfied there is no substance to allegations that Army intelligence had knowledge of homosexual abuse at Kincora.\"\n\nThis inexplicable conclusion almost certainly misled the British Parliament. Moreover, Terry failed to inform Parliament that MI5 had refused to allow one of their senior officers, who had blocked prior military investigations into Kincora, to be questioned by his investigators.\n\nIt was, therefore, no surprise that Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly ridiculed the report. John Cushnahan, a spokesman for the non-sectarian Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, was indignant: he found one of the most disturbing aspects of Terry's conclusions was the complete dismissal of any possibility that military circles knew about the scandal. He then referred to a number of people as having been interviewed by British Army people for British military intelligence about William McGrath and Kincora. Cushnahan concluded by saying that it was misleading and blatantly dishonest for Terry to claim that the whole matter had been fully ventilated.\n\nDespite the obvious and unexplained weaknesses of the Terry Inquiry, Prior told Parliament that a 1921 Act Inquiry was not justified. Instead, Prior proposed to establish a public inquiry under the powers contained in article 54 of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 to examine the administration of Kincora and of young people's hostels in Northern Ireland. That Inquiry would be led by a retired circuit judge, Judge William Hughes and it was decided that \"It will be up to the Inquiry and the eminent judge who will preside over it to examine anything which is relevant to the particular boy's home (Kincora), or to the other five boys' homes, and the circumstances which led up to the problems.\"\n\nWhen asked on \"The World At One\" (BBC Radio 4, 18 January 1984) if the inquiry would take evidence on the alleged activities of the intelligence agencies, Prior replied that if there was any evidence, it would.\n\nDespite these assurances given by Prior, Judge Hughes made it clear in his report: \"The conduct of the police, or elected representatives, or clergymen, or military intelligence or any other persons who may have been in receipt of allegations, information or rumours relating to Kincora or any other home, was not under scrutiny in this Inquiry.\" Colin Wallace's evidence was, therefore, excluded from the Hughes Inquiry.\n\nIn July 2014, Exaro News reported that the late Lord Havers, as Attorney General in 1984, limited the terms of reference for the Inquiry to exclude politicians and other key categories of people from investigation. \n\nIn 1974, Wallace's Army Annual Confidential Report described his performance in Northern Ireland as \"outstanding\" and said that he had made \"one of the most effective personal contributions of any to the standing and reputation of the Army in these troubles.\" The Report was signed by the Commander Land Forces, Northern Ireland, Major General Peter Leng.\n\nLater that year, Wallace was promoted to Senior Information Officer and, shortly afterwards, he wrote a lengthy memorandum to his superiors complaining that no action was being taken to stop the sexual abuse of children at the Kincora Home. A few weeks later he was removed from his job on the grounds that his life \"was in danger\", and posted to an Army HQ in England.\n\nFormer BBC journalist, Martin Dillon, who has written several best-selling books on the Northern Ireland conflict, says:\n\nOne of the ghastly aspects of what became known as 'The Kincora Scandal' was that McGrath and McKeague (another Loyalist paramilitary paedophile), as Intelligence assets, were agents of the State. What Wallace was unaware of was that McGrath and McKeague had virtual immunity from prosecution because of the information they were supplying to their Intelligence bosses. According to Chris Moore's (another BBC journalist) investigations of McGrath, MI5 was the organisation that recruited and funded his political activities. They were fully aware of contacts he made with Rhodesian and South African Intelligence in order to acquire arms for Loyalists.\n\nChris Moore summed up the situation succinctly:\n\nMcGrath made it obvious to all those who heard him speak that he was acting on Intelligence. There was a higher authority; McGrath was not alone. Figures like John McKeague spring to mind, and there are other documented episodes like the Colin Wallace affair and the case of Brian Nelson to suggest strongly that British Intelligence had penetrated and was manipulating the loyalist paramilitary underground from the early 1970s onwards. Where was the democratic control over all this unquestionably illegal activity? Why have elected representatives, including MPs from Northern Ireland itself, been so reluctant to become involved in uncovering the truth?\n\nIn 1980, David McKittrick of the Irish Times, reported how he had been briefed by Wallace \"many times\" during the 1970s:\n\nIt was clear that he had access to the highest levels of intelligence data. He had a encyclopaedic memory, which he occasionally refreshed with calls made on his personal scrambler telephone to the headquarters intelligence section a few floors above his office.\n\nPeter Broderick, Head of the Army Information Services at HQ Northern Ireland in 1973, said:\n\nTo my knowledge, he (Wallace) worked at least 80 hours a week: coming to his desk every day. He lived in the Officers Mess and regarded himself as always on duty. On my arrival, I found that he had taken virtually no leave for six years. He had a knowledge of the Irish situation which was totally unique in the Headquarters and surpassed that even of most of the Intelligence Branch. As time progressed, he was not only the main briefer for the press, but also the adviser on Irish matters to the whole Headquarters and - because of his personal talents - contributed much creative thought to the Information Policy Unit. In order to do his job, he had constant and free access to information of the highest classification and extreme sensitivity.\n\nIn 1980, shortly after the Kincora story appeared in the press, Wallace was arrested and subsequently convicted of the manslaughter of the husband of one of his colleagues. It was reported that Wallace had beaten antiques dealer Jonathan Lewis to death before attending a dinner party with the dead man's wife. Later that night, Wallace was alleged to have dumped the body in the River Arun. He served six years in gaol, from 1981 to 1987.\n\nThe conviction was quashed in 1996 in the light of new forensic and other evidence. During the appeal hearing, a Home Office pathologist, Dr Ian West, admitted that some of the evidence that he had used at Wallace's trial had been supplied to him by \"an American security source\". The journalist Paul Foot, in his book \"Who Framed Colin Wallace?\", suggested that Wallace may have been framed for the killing, possibly by renegade members of the security services in a bid to discredit his allegations about the Kincora scandal, and the fact that members of the intelligence community had attempted to rig the 1974 general election after which Harold Wilson came to power with a minority government.\n\nWallace himself suggested that Lewis had been murdered by 'rivals in the antiques trade' and that the police had suppressed evidence to that effect.\n\nIn June 1998, a former Special Branch officer who was familiar with the Wallace case wrote to Paul Foot saying:\n\nI sincerely believe that Colin Wallace was 'fitted up' by corrupt members of the Establishment embarrassed by the events described in the early part of your book. I do not suggest for a moment that any Sussex Police officer involved in this enquiry was corrupt, because I do not believe they were, but I feel there was a hidden agenda, and that the senior officers knew a lot more about the matter than they would ever care to reveal.\n\nAs the controversy over the Kincora affair gathered momentum, Alex Carlile QC (now Lord Carlile), the SDP–Liberal Alliance's Legal Affairs spokesman, issued a statement saying: \"It is clear that Colin Wallace, a principled man, knew too much about the Kincora Boys' Home scandal.\"\n\nTwo months later, Mr Carlile was quoted in the \"Sunday Today\" newspaper saying:\n\nI believe there are many people in high places and within the security services who feel ill-will towards Wallace for exposing their activities. The question is that if MI5 was prepared to kill to get even with Wallace, why not kill him? It may be that Wallace's allegations about MI5 officers being involved in activities verging on the treasonable were widely known - so if any harm came to him the finger would point directly at them. I have tried repeatedly in the House to get an adjournment on the conviction and will continue to do so.\"\n\nIn 1987, a former senior Ministry of Defence official, Clive Ponting, was quoted on Channel 4 News about high-level meetings he had taken part in with MI5 officers regarding Wallace's case.\n\nThere was never any suspicion that Wallace was making these stories up or that it was totally unfounded and very easy to rubbish. It was very much a matter that, OK the story was being contained at the moment because he was in jail, but that in a few years' time he would be back out again and could be expected to start making the allegations again and then that would be a serious problem.\n\nIn 1987 Wallace appeared on the first programme of the Channel 4 discussion series \"After Dark\" alongside Clive Ponting, T. E. Utley, Peter Hain and others.\n\nIn the House of Commons, in 1990, the Government admitted that Ministers had \"inadvertently misled\" Parliament over Wallace's role and confirmed that he had been involved in disinformation activities on behalf of the security forces and that he had been authorised to supply, on occasions, classified information to journalists.\n\nIn a letter to Terence Higgins MP on 30 January 1990, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher referred to earlier statements made by Government Ministers about the Wallace case and said:\n\nI regret to say that a re-examination of departmental papers has brought to light information which shows that there were a number of statements in my letters, and in other Ministerial statements and official correspondence, which were incorrect or require clarification.\n\nLater that day, the Armed Forces Minister, Mr Archie Hamilton made an extraordinary statement to the House of Commons admitting that several key allegations consistently made by Wallace were in fact true.\n\nPapers which have now come to light indicate that, when the case was made to establish Mr. Wallace's post, it was proposed that its duties should include responsibilities for providing unattributable covert briefings to the press ; and it was stated that the incumbent would be required to make on-the-spot decisions on matters of national security during such interviews. It seems that, in the event, the arguments for including these responsibilities in Mr. Wallace's job description were made orally rather than in writing to those who approved the establishment of the SIO post. But presumably Mr. Wallace was told what duties he was expected to carry out; and indeed it would appear that he had already been undertaking unattributable briefing activities of this kind, which may have included disinformation.\n\nA government inquiry set up by Prime Minister Thatcher and undertaken by Sir David Calcutt QC confirmed that Wallace had, indeed, been working for the intelligence services during the 1970s and that his enforced resignation from the Ministry of Defence had been made on the basis of a false job description designed to conceal his covert role in psychological warfare. Sir David Calcutt also found that members of the Security Service (MI5) had manipulated the disciplinary proceedings taken against Wallace. In the light of the Inquiry's findings, Wallace was awarded compensation by the Government.\n\nWallace's solicitor, Jim Nicol, referred Sir David Calcutt's report to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, on the basis that the conclusions indicated that Security Service officers who manipulated the proceedings had attempted to defraud Wallace. The Metropolitan Police referred the matter to the DPP for guidance. The DPP concluded that it would not be in the public interest for the police to pursue the matter.\n\nDespite the findings of the Calcutt Inquiry, the Ministry of Defence refused to allow the Defence Select Committee to have access to Wallace's secret job description. In a letter dated 11 February 1991, the Ministry of Defence said that Wallace's job description contained \"sensitive information relating to the security and intelligence matters\" and that the provision of such papers, even under the conditions relating to the Committee's access to classified information, \"would be inconsistent with the conventions\"\n\nEvidence from Wallace was used by the Barron Report, an Irish government inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.\n\nA letter from Colin Wallace to Tony Stoughton, the Chief Information Officer of the Army Information Service at Lisburn, on 14 August 1975 noted the connections between Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) paramilitaries and intelligence agencies of the British Army and of the RUC Special Branch:\n\nThere is good evidence the Dublin bombings [see Dublin and Monaghan bombings] in May last year were a reprisal for the Irish government's role in bringing about the [power sharing] Executive. According to one of Craig's people [Craig Smellie, the top MI6 officer in Northern Ireland at the time], some of those involved, the Youngs, the Jacksons, Mulholland, Hanna, Kerr and McConnell were working closely with SB [Special Branch] and Int [Intelligence] at that time. Craig's people believe the sectarian assassinations were designed to destroy [then Northern Secretary Merlyn] Rees's attempts to negotiate a ceasefire, and the targets were identified for both sides by Int/SB. They also believe some very senior RUC officers were involved with this group. In short, it would appear that loyalist paramilitaries and Int/SB members have formed some sort of pseudo-gangs in an attempt to fight a war of attrition by getting paramilitaries on both sides to kill each other and, at the same time, prevent any future political initiative such as Sunningdale.\nIn a further letter dated 30 September 1975, Wallace revealed that MI5 was trying to create a split in the UVF in order to foment violence:\n\nbecause they wanted the more politically minded ones ousted. I believe much of the violence generated during the latter part of last year was caused by some of the new Int people deliberately stirring up the conflict. As you know, we have never been allowed to target the breakaway UVF, nor the UFF, during the past year. Yet they have killed more people than the IRA!\n\nIn December 2003, the Dáil's Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, published the \"Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings\" which took place in May 1974. The Inquiry was led by a former Irish Supreme Court Judge, Mr Justice Henry Barron. Judge Barron interviewed Wallace on a number of occasions during the Inquiry and comments:\n\nJudge Barron also refers to what he calls \"the dubious nature of his (Wallace's) conviction for manslaughter in 1981\", and points out that the \"conviction was quashed on 21 July 1996.\"\n\nIn his book, \"Inside Intelligence\", former SIS officer Anthony Cavendish confirms that he knew Wallace and says that his story is \"frightening and disquieting, but one which ties in with many events to which I have been privy\". Cavendish sent Wallace a first edition of his book which contains the following inscription: \"Colin - a great help and a true friend.\"\n\nCavendish, a close friend over many years of Sir Maurice Oldfield, former Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, says that Wallace's assertion that Oldfield was the target of a black propaganda campaign by MI5, \"match closely details which were told to me privately by Maurice.\"\n\nIn his biography of Sir Maurice Oldfield. Richard Deacon [Donald McCormick] writes:\n\nWho were Oldfield's enemies? Who wanted to hound him even in retirement and, if possible, to destroy him totally? These were questions which I felt it imperative to try to answer. I tried to track down the source of these various stories which became embroidered as time passed, but there was nothing positive one could go on other than word of mouth gossip. My information is that the first report came not from the IRA, but from an undisclosed Ulster Defence Regiment source. Later sources suggested the stories came from inside the British Army.\nThe intelligence world in which Wallace operated in Northern Ireland was graphically described by Lord Stevens, former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Lord Stevens had presided over the Stevens Inquiries into collusion between the intelligence services, the British Army, the RUC and loyalist paramilitaries in the murders of Irish nationalists. In May 2011, he gave evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft Detention of Terrorist Suspects (Temporary Extension) Bills and said:\n\nWhen you talk about Intelligence, of the 210 people we arrested, only three were not (Intelligence) agents. Some of them were agents for all four of those particular organisations (Army, MI5, MI6 and Special Branch), fighting against each other, doing things and making a large sum of money, which was all against the public interest and creating mayhem in Northern Ireland. Any system that is created in relation to this country and Northern Ireland has to have a proper controlling mechanism. It has to have a mechanism where someone is accountable for what the actions are and that has to be transparent.\n\nTo this day, Wallace's full role on behalf of the Army remains a mystery. Former members of the Special Forces admit that Wallace worked with them as far afield as Berlin and the Oman during the Cold War, but the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Services still try to distance themselves from what Wallace was doing in Northern Ireland. He had been part of the Army team preparing for the Widgery Tribunal into the Bloody Sunday killings of protesters in Derry, and in 2002 he testified at the Saville Inquiry into the events.\n\nOne of Wallace's close friends in the Army described him as follows: \"I played golf with the General. That was an accident. Colin was needed by the General. Everyone needed him. They just could not do without him.\"\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Tony Yarnold, who worked with Wallace in Northern Ireland, said: \"Let's face it, Colin was the lynchpin of the whole operation. He was terrific - way ahead of us all in his knowledge and his readiness to work. Everyone wanted him all the time, and somehow he was always available.\"\n\nA former Ministry of Defence Chief Information Officer commented: \"For loyalty and dedication to the Army, Colin Wallace was in a class of his own. I just cannot conceive of any situation in which he would act maliciously against the interests of the Crown or the Army.\" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "19911298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19911298", "title": "Dragonslayer", "text": "Dragonslayer\n\nA dragonslayer is a person or being that slays dragons. Dragonslayers and the creatures they hunt have been popular in traditional stories from around the world: they are a type of story classified as type 300 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system. They continue to be popular in modern books, films, video-games and other entertainments. Dragonslayer-themed stories are also sometimes seen as having a chaoskampf theme - in which a heroic figure struggles against a monster that epitomises chaos.\n\nA dragonslayer is often the hero in a \"Princess and dragon\" tale. In this type of story, the dragonslayer kills the dragon in order to rescue a high-class female character from being devoured by it. This female character often then becomes the love interest of the account. One notable example of this kind of legend is the story of Ragnar Loðbrók, who slays a giant serpent, thereby rescuing the maiden, Þóra borgarhjörtr, whom he later marries.\n\nThere are, however, several notable exceptions to this common motif. In the legend of Saint George and the Dragon, for example, Saint George overcomes the dragon as part of a plot which ends with the conversion of the dragon's grateful victims to Christianity, rather than Saint George being married to the rescued princess character.\n\nIn a Norse legend from the Völsunga saga, the dragonslayer, Sigurd, kills Fafnir - a dwarf who has been turned into a dragon as a result of guarding the cursed ring that had once belonged to the dwarf, Andvari. After slaying the dragon, Sigurd drinks some of the dragon's blood and thereby gains the ability to understand the speech of birds. He also bathes in the dragon's blood, causing his skin to become invulnerable. Sigurd overhears two nearby birds discussing the heinous treachery being planned by his companion, Regin. In response to the plot, Sigurd kills Regin, thereby averting the treachery. \n\nMythologists such as Joseph Campbell have argued that dragonslayer myths can be seen as a psychological metaphor:\n\n\"But as Siegfried [Sigurd] learned, he must then taste the dragon blood, in order to take to himself something of that dragon power. When Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted the blood, he hears the song of nature. he has transcended his humanity and re-associated himself with the powers of nature, which are powers of our life, and from which our minds remove us.\n\n...Psychologically, the dragon is one's own binding of oneself to one's own ego.\"\n\n"}

Previously, he served as the editor-in-chief and the CEO of the conservative political blog RedState and was a political contributor for CNN.\n\nErick-Woods Erickson was born in Jackson in East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates when he was five, and returned to Jackson when he was fifteen. Erickson attended the American School of Dubai, previously known as the Jumeirah American School. His father worked for Conoco Oil as an oil company production foreman. Erickson received a bachelor's degree from Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, and a law degree from Mercer’s Walter F. George School of Law. He is an inactive member in good standing of the State Bar of Georgia.\n\nErickson was elected on November 6, 2007 to a four-year term as a Republican member of the Macon, Georgia city council. He resigned his office on February 16, 2011, partway through his first term to pursue a job with WSB radio in Atlanta; The \"Macon Telegraph\" noted his poor attendance as a council member before his resignation. While he was in office, Macon police officers considered forming a union. To counter it, Erickson urged that the police department be dissolved.\n\nErickson joined the conservative blog RedState in 2005. He later served as its editor-in-chief. Erickson was CEO of RedState, Inc. While working at RedState, Erickson developed a reputation as one of the most influential American conservatives. Erickson's \"Morning Briefing\" e-mails grew from 498 subscribers when they began in February 2009 to nearly 70,000 by January 2010. \"The Washington Post\" noted that \"The ability of a single e-mail to shape a message illustrates the power of the conservative network.\" The article described Erickson as one of the American conservative movement's \"key national players\".\n\nErickson wrote the \"Confessions of a Political Junkie\" blog and is former editor-in-chief of the \"Peach Pundit\" blog.

Toward the end of Erickson's career at RedState he began to increase his focus on his radio show, which was owned by Cox Media Group. He eventually quit the site to work on it full-time.\n\nIn January 2016, Erickson launched the conservative website The Resurgent.\n\nThe \"Daily Telegraph\" of London put Erickson on its \"List of Most Influential US Conservatives\", giving him a rank of 69th most influential in 2007 and 65th in 2010. According to the 2007 newspaper article: \"Erickson epitomises the new power of the internet. A small-government fiscal and social conservative based in the south, he taps into and influences the Republican 'base' that the GOP’s 2008 candidates are courting.\" According to \"The Atlantic\", Erickson's conservatism is more traditional (as opposed to libertarian) and \"deeply informed by his evangelical faith\". Erickson emphasizes small government, strong national defense, and the primacy of the traditional family.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Erickson disinvited Donald Trump from a RedState gathering held in Atlanta. During a CNN interview after a Republican Party debate hosted by Fox News Channel on August 6, 2015, Trump had said that the Fox News anchor and debate co-moderator Megyn Kelly had “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever” while questioning him during the debate. According to Erickson, Trump's remark \"was a bridge too far” and that even \"blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross\" certain lines, including decency. The following day, Trump released a statement stating that Erickson had a history of making controversial statements for which he has had to apologize, and that he, Trump, was an outsider who did not fit into Erickson's agenda.\n\nIn 2013, Erickson was criticized for saying in an interview on Fox Business Network that males dominate females in the \"natural world\" and it was only \"science\" for men to be the breadwinners for their family.\n\nIn December 2015, Erickson posted a picture of a bullet ridden copy of \"The New York Times\" that he had shot at. That day's edition contained a front-page editorial in favor of gun control.\n\nErickson spread a false story by RedState which claimed that 17-year old Parkland, Florida school shooting survivor David Hogg was not actually at the Parkland school when it was attacked. He later described Hogg as a \"bully\" after Hogg called for an advertiser boycott of right-wing Fox News host Laura Ingraham when she mocked him for not getting into a number of universities.\n\nIn 2017, Erickson signed a manifesto which condemned homosexuality and transgender identity, saying that homosexual and transgender identity was not according to God's plan.\n\nIn April 2009, Erickson described retiring Supreme Court Justice David Souter on his Twitter account as \"the only goat fucking child molester to ever serve on the Supreme Court”. In an appearance on \"The Colbert Report\", Erickson said the statement was \"not my finest hour.\" Erickson called Texas state senator Wendy Davis “Abortion Barbie.” In a blog post, Erickson considered whether President Obama was “shagging hookers” and wondered whether Michelle Obama (whom he called a “marxist harpy”) “would go Lorena Bobbit [\"sic\"] on him should he even think about it.” Erickson argued that President Obama won the Nobel Prize because of an “affirmative action quota.” Erickson compared the Obama administration's health care communications director Linda Douglass to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels.\n\nIn November 2018, Erickson tweeted that foreign aid to Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico would be more effectively spent installing \"Pinochet types\" in these countries. He added that the US should \"support strong leaders who support free market reforms and promote economic stability, even if with a heavy hand\". When challenged on this proposal, Erickson replied \"I'm hoping for some helicopters in this plan\", a reference to Death flights in Chile during Pinochet's regime.\n\nIn 2017 he published a book \"Before You Wake: Life Lessons from a Father to His Children\".\n\n"}

Julius Leviné died when Eugen was 3 years old, and Rozalia emigrated to Germany with her son, settling in Wiesbaden and Mannheim. Eugen went on to study law at the Heidelberg University. He returned to Russia to participate in the failed revolution of 1905 against the Tsar. For his actions, he was exiled to Siberia. He eventually escaped to Germany and began studying at Heidelberg University and, in 1915, married Rosa Broido from the Polish town of Gródek. They had at least one child, a son, whom they named Eugen. For a short time, he served in the Imperial German Army during the First World War.\n\nAfter the war ended, Leviné joined the Communist Party of Germany and helped to create a socialist republic in Bavaria. However, the republic lasted only several weeks, replaced quickly by a Soviet-style republic after the assassination of Kurt Eisner, then leader of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD).\n\nThe ruling government of the new republic lasted only six days, due to poor leadership under the German playwright Ernst Toller. Leviné rose to power as the communists assumed control of the government.\n\nLeviné attempted to pass many reforms, such as giving the more luxurious flats to the homeless and giving workers control and ownership of factories. He also planned reforms for the education system and to abolish paper money, neither of which he ever completed.\n\nUnder orders from Leviné, the Red Guards began rounding up people they considered to be hostile to the new regime as hostages against imminent outside attack. As the German president Friedrich Ebert gave orders to subdue the Council Republic and reinstate the Bavarian government under Johannes Hoffmann, the Red Guards executed eight hostages on 29 April 1919.\n\nThe German Army, assisted by Freikorps, with a force of roughly 39,000 men, invaded and quickly conquered Munich on 3 May 1919. In retaliation for the execution of the hostages, the Freikorps captured and killed some 700 men and women. Leviné himself was arrested, found guilty as part of those executions, and was shot by firing squad in Stadelheim Prison.\n\nThe American Soviet agent and later outspoken anti-communist Whittaker Chambers cited Leviné as one of three men who inspired him. Chambers wrote,During the Bavarian Council Republic in 1919, Leviné was the organiser of the Workers' and Soldiers' Soviets. When the Bavarian Council Republic was crushed, Leviné was captured and court-martialed. The court-martial told him: \"You are under sentence of death.\" Leviné answered: \"We Communists are always under sentence of death.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1504359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1504359", "title": "Huaso", "text": "Huaso\n\nA huaso () is a Chilean countryman and skilled horseman, similar to the American cowboy or Mexican \"charro\", the gaucho of Argentina, Uruguay and Rio Grande Do Sul and the Australian stockman. A female \"huaso\" is called a huasa, although the term china is far more commonly used for his wife or sweetheart, whose dress can be seen in cueca dancing. Huasos are found all over Central and Southern Chile while the Magallanes Region sheep raisers are gauchos. The major difference between the huaso and the gaucho is that huasos are involved in farming as well as cattle herding.\n\nHuasos (plural) are generally found in Chile's central valley. They ride horses and typically wear a straw hat called a \"chupalla\". They also wear a poncho—called a \"manta\" or a \"chamanto\" (although this was originally reserved to land owners, as it is much more expensive)—over a short Andalusian waist jacket, as well as tooled leather legging over booties with raw hide leather spur holders that sustain a long-shanked spur with 4-inch rowels, and many other typical garments.\n\nHuasos are an important part of Chilean folkloric culture and are a vital part of parades, fiestas, holidays, and popular music. The dancing of the cueca in which the coy china is courted by the persistent huaso, both traditionally attired, is \"de rigueur\" on such occasions.\n\nIn Chile, the term \"huaso\" or \"ahuasado\" (in a \"huaso\" way) is also used disparagingly to refer to people without manners or lacking the sophistication of an urbanite, akin to US English redneck.\n\nVarious theories are commonly advanced: from the Quechua \"wakcha\" (hispanicized as \"huacho\") meaning \"orphan\", \"not belonging to a community\", hence free and homeless, an important aspect of the huaso/gaucho myth, or alternatively from the Quechua \"wasu\", meaning either the back of an animal, or rough and rustic. Moreover the word \"guaso/a\" is used in Andalusian and American Spanish with the last sense. \n\nIt appears that a form of folk etymology has operated to conflate the contrasting identities of the huaso, viewed as both a free horseman (implying some wealth and nobility) and an unsophisticated country bumpkin. Both senses can be observed in Chilean usage.\n\n\n"}

A shooting guard and small forward, Conley is best known for being the only freshman to ever lead NCAA Division I in scoring.\n\nJason Conley was born in San Antonio, Texas and attended Montrose Christian School in Rockville, a perennial national high school basketball power that has sent many players to the Division I and professional levels. He did not catch many college basketball recruiters' attention, but Virginia Military Institute, a small Division I university located in Lexington, Virginia offered him a scholarship.\n\nConley is dyslexic and failed to attain the minimum SAT entrance exam score to be eligible to play college basketball right after high school. To try to help him qualify, he spent one year at a postgraduate school called Millersburg (Ky.) Military Institute, but Conley still fell short of his SAT requirement. As a partial qualifier, he sat out one year at VMI but did not lose a year of eligibility.\n\nWhen Conley's college basketball career finally started in 2001, two full years after his high school graduation in 1999, he burst onto the national scene. As a freshman, Conley started all 28 games, averaged 29.3 points, 8.0 rebounds and 2.9 steals per game while shooting 46.7% from the field and 81.8% from the free throw line. He had some of his best games against top-tier competition: 24 points against Kentucky, 25 against Virginia and even 38 against Villanova.\n\nWhen the 2001–02 season had come to a close, Conley's 29.3 ppg average made him the first freshman ever to win the national scoring title. He was named the Co-Southern Conference Player of the Year with Dimeco Childress of East Tennessee.\n\nConley followed up an historical freshman campaign at VMI with a sophomore season that saw him transfer to Missouri after the first semester had ended. At the time, Conley played in 10 games and was averaging 22.2 ppg with VMI. Since he transferred midway through an academic year, he only had to sit out the spring semester at Missouri before he was eligible to suit up for the Tigers the following year.\n\nAs a junior in 2003–04, Conley was selected to the Big 12 Conference All-Newcomer and All-Reserve Teams. He averaged 7.6 points and 3.4 rebounds in 18.2 minutes per game, and scored a season-high 24 points in a win over Baylor. As a senior in 2004–05, Conley's role on Missouri increased as he averaged 10.2 points and 5.9 rebounds in a career-high 33 games played. Although neither of his seasons at Missouri matched what he accomplished at Virginia Military Institute, he still finished his college basketball career with 1,567 points and 557 rebounds.\n\nThe closest Conley came to making a National Basketball Association (NBA) roster was participating for the Atlanta Hawks' summer league team in 2005. He was signed to play for Germany's Telekom Baskets Bonn in 2005, a team he stayed with through 2007–08. He followed this with one-month stints for Finland's Porvoon Tarmo (February 2009) and Namika Lahti (March 2009). In 2009–10, Conley signed with WBC Kraftwerk Wels of the Austrian A Bundesliga.\n\n"}

They were Christian martyrs who died at either Antioch or, more probably, at Antinoe, in the reign of Diocletian, early in the fourth century, on 9 January, according to the \"Roman Martyrology\", or 8 January, according to the Greek \"Menaea\".\n\nTheir feast day is also given as 6 January, while a group of people martyred with Julian (Celsus, Marcionilla, Anthony, Anastasius) have the feast day of January 9.\n\nThere exists no historically certain data relating to these two personages, and more than once this Julian of Antinoe has been confounded with Julian of Cilicia. The confusion is easily explained by the fact that thirty-nine saints of this name are mentioned in the \"Roman Martyrology\", eight of whom are commemorated in the one month of January. But little is known of this saint, aside from the exaggerations of his \"Acts\".\n\nForced by his family to marry, he agreed with his spouse, Basilissa, that they should both preserve their virginity, and further encouraged her to found a convent for women, of which she became the superior, while he himself gathered a large number of monks and undertook their direction. The two converted their home into a hospital which could house up to 1,000 people (thus, Julian is often confused with Julian the Hospitaller).\n\nBasilissa, after having stood severe persecutions, died in peace; Julian survived her many years, but was martyred, (together with Celsus a youth, Antony a priest, Anastatius, and Marcianilla the mother of Celsus) under the Persecutions of Diocletian.\n\nDuring the persecution of Diocletian he was arrested, tortured, and put to death at Antioch, in Syria, by the order of the governor, Martian, according to the Latins, at Antinoe, in Egypt, according to the Greeks, which seems more probable. Unfortunately, as with most saints lives the exact historical details are hard to parse from the religious tropes and maxims. \n\nCelsus, the young son of Marcionilla, was martyred along with Julian. The priest Anthony (Antony) was martyred at the same time, as well as a convert and neophyte named Anastasius. Marcionilla's seven brothers are also said to have been killed.\n\nIn any case, these two saints must have enjoyed a great reputation in antiquity, and their veneration was well established before the eighth century. In the \"Martyrologium Hieronymianum\" they are mentioned under 6 January; Usuard, Ado, Notker of St Gall, and others place them under the ninth, and Rabanus Maurus under the thirteenth of the same month, while Vandelbert puts them under 13 February, and the Menology of Canisius under 21 June, the day to which the Greek Menaea assign St. Julian of Caesarea. There used to exist at Constantinople a church under the invocation of these saints, the dedication of which is inscribed in the Greek Calendar under 5 July.\n\nOnly a fragment of Ælfric's \"Passion of St. Julian and His Wife Basilissa\" from his \"Lives of the Saints\" has survived, but the traditional legend is there: the two saints vow not to consummate their marriage on their wedding night, and devote themselves to \"clænnysse\" (\"chastity\").

The phrase indicated that \"As the prophecy [of the \"kudan\"] is always true, so too is the information in this document.\" However, while the description of the \"kudan\" did not appear until the late Edo Period, the idiom \"like the \"kudan\"\" has been documented since the Heian period. It appears on page 128 of the early 11th century book \"The Pillow Book\". For this reason, the relationship between the phrase \"like the \"kudan\" and the \"yōkai\" is considered an anachronistic one.\n\nTraditionally, the \"kudan\" is depicted as having the head of a human and the body of a bovine. Subsequent depictions have occasionally switched these elements and placed the head of a bovine onto the body of a human similar to a Minotaur.\n\nDuring the period of post war reconstruction which followed World War II, another rumour similar to that of the \"kudan\" started to appear. Instead of a human-faced bovine, the creature spoken of was a kimono-wearing woman with a cow's face, referred to as .\n\nThe most widespread interpretation of the \"kudan\" comes from the Edo period, in which it is described as a creature which—despite being born from a cow—has the ability to use human speech. The creatures invariably die just a few short days after their birth, yet in that time they are said to coincide with some major event. Sometimes these events bring various misfortunes such as poor crop harvest, natural disasters, or sickness, only for the \"kudan\" to die when the event has come to pass.\n\nThey are also said to issue prophecies of things to come. These prophecies typically depict bleak happenings such as war. A \"kudan\" was rumoured to have predicted Japan's defeat during World War II. Despite this, pictures and talismans of the \"kudan\" are still seen as good luck charms due to their association with honesty.\n\nFrom the Edo period through Shōwa period, there have been several reported sightings throughout Japan, though they are most often reported in Western Japan. The earliest recorded appearance of the \"kudan\" comes in 1827 from Tateyama in Etchū Province (now part of Toyama Prefecture). Originally, the creature was referred to as .\n\nPickers of wild plants came across a monster with a human face in the mountains calling itself \"Kudabe\"\". The creature predicted that \"many would fall victim to an epidemic plague within the next few years. However, if a person were to carry and look upon a drawing of [the \"Kudabe\"], they would be spared\". This then became something of a tradition, and amulets containing pictures of the \"Kudabe\" became very popular. Similarly, amulets containing pictures of the —an omen associated with cholera outbreaks—were believed to save people from cholera.\n\nThe earliest pictorial example of a creature referred to as \"kudan\" was reported on an engraved tile in 1836. According to the tile, in \"December 1836, in Tango province, a monster with the face of a human and the body of a cattle called \"kudan\" appeared on Kurahashi Mountain\". The engraving also stated that \"a kudan also appeared in December 1705, and a good harvest followed. Any who wore an amulet depicting the \"kudan\" experienced great family prosperity even in times of sickness, and large harvests in times of famine. Indeed, it is an auspicious beast! Because the \"kudan\" is an honest beast, it is customary to write \"like the \"Kudan\"\" at the end of every act and deed\". At this time, the Tenpo famine was at its peak, and so it is believed that this report was intended to \"give people hope of a good harvest\".\n\nOn June 21, 1909, a Nagoya newspaper reported a sighting of the \"kudan\". According to the article, a calf had been born with a human face a decade before in a farmhouse on the Gotō Islands. It reported that \"It died only 31 days after its birth and prophesied a war between Japan and Russia.\" The calf was later stuffed and put on display in the Yahiro Museum in Nagasaki. The museum has since closed and the calf's whereabouts are unknown.\n\nFrom the Meiji period to the early Shōwa period, objects referred to as \"stuffed \"kudan\"\" started to appear in \"spectacle huts\". In his book \"From Hoki to Oki\", Lafcadio Hearn makes mention of these huts and travelling entertainers who would spread rumours of the \"kudan\" legend. According to this report, a travelling entertainer in 1892 brought a stuffed \"kudan\" aboard a ship bound for Mihonoseki. However, due to the unholy nature of the beast, the gods sent strong winds as punishment and the ship was unable to land at Mihonoseki.\n\nThe theory about the \"kudan\" being a benevolent wish-granting creature subsided during the Shōwa period and was replaced by greater emphasis on the \"kudan's\" wartime prophecies. A kudan appeared in 1930 in a forest in Kagawa Prefecture, prophesying: \"Soon, there will be a great war. You shall win, but you will later be struck down by plague. However, those who eat red beans and tie yarn around their wrists within 3 days of hearing this prophecy shall not fall sick.\" In 1933, this rumor reached Nagano Prefecture and quickly spread, with elementary school students spreading it further by taking red bean rice into school for their lunches. However, the content of the rumor changed. Instead of a \"kudan\", the prophecy was attributed to a snake-headed beast, sent by the deity of the Suwa Grand Shrine in Nagano Prefecture: Mishaguchi.\n\nDuring World War II, many rumors were spread about prophecies regarding the war and air raids. In 1943, a \"kudan\" was said to have been born in a Geta shop in Iwakuni. This \"kudan\" predicted that \"the war will end next year, around April or May.\" It was then reported in the spring of 1945 in Matsuyama that \"A Kudan has been born in Kobe. He says that 'anyone who consumes red beans or bean cakes within three days of hearing this tale shall escape the air raids.'\" The rumors quickly circulated throughout Matsuyama.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1248719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1248719", "title": "Louis Wigfall", "text": "Louis Wigfall\n\nLouis Wigfall (born Louis Trezevant Wigfall; April 21, 1816 – February 18, 1874) was an American politician who served as a Confederate States Senator from Texas from 1862 to 1865. He was among a group of leading secessionists known as Fire-Eaters, advocating the preservation and expansion of an aristocratic agricultural society based on slave labor. He briefly served as a Confederate Brigadier General of the Texas Brigade at the outset of the American Civil War before taking his seat in the Confederate Senate. Wigfall's reputation for oratory and hard-drinking, along with a combative nature and high-minded sense of personal honor, made him one of the more imposing political figures of his time.\n\nWigfall was born on a plantation near Edgefield, South Carolina, to Levi Durant and Eliza Thomson Wigfall. His father, who died in 1818, was a successful Charleston merchant before moving to Edgefield. His mother was of the French Huguenot Trezavant family. She died when young Louis was 13. An older brother, Hamden, was killed in a duel. Another, Arthur, became a bishop in the Episcopal Church.\n\nTutored by a guardian until 1834, he then spent a year at Rice Creek Springs School, a military academy near Columbia, South Carolina, for children of elite aristocrats. He then entered the University of Virginia. A perceived insult by another student prompted the first of many dueling challenges he would make, but the affair was resolved peaceably.\n\nIn 1836 he entered South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) to complete his studies, but his attendance was erratic. He developed an interest in the law, participated in debating clubs, and wrote epistles on student rights. Most of his time however, was spent at off-campus taverns rather than at his studies. He abandoned academics altogether for three months to fight in the Third Seminole War in Florida, achieving the rank of Lieutenant of volunteers. Despite these distractions he managed to graduate in 1837. A fellow graduate considered to be his closest friend was John Lawrence Manning, who would later become a governor of South Carolina.\n\nIn 1839 Wigfall returned to Edgefield and took over his brother's law practice. Having squandered his inheritance, and with a proclivity for drinking and gambling, he accumulated debts. He borrowed from friends to maintain a freewheeling lifestyle, including from his future bride. \"Mere office business\" as an upcountry lawyer did not suit his temperament and sense of purpose, nor prove to be as profitable as he had hoped.\n\nIn 1841 Wigfall married his second cousin, Charlotte Maria Cross, daughter of the prominent Charlestown lawyer and former South Carolina State Controller, Col. George Warren Cross, and his wife, Frances Maria Halsey.\n\nTheir Children were:\n\nIn the South Carolina gubernatorial election of 1840, Wigfall actively supported the candidacy of John Peter Richardson over the more radical James Henry Hammond, which led to public exchanges of arguments and insults. In a five-month period, Wigfall managed to get into a fistfight, two duels, three near-duels, and was charged, but not indicted, for killing a man. This outbreak of political violence culminated in 1840 on an island in the Savannah River near Augusta, Georgia, where Wigfall took a bullet through both thighs while dueling with future Congressman Preston Brooks. Although Hammond lost the race for Governor, he attempted to mediate the dispute between the two hot-headed young men. Wigfall received an aide-de-camp and Lieutenant Colonelcy on Governor Richardson's staff, but never was completely satisfied with the outcome of the Brooks affair.\n\nThis initial foray into politics and the Brooks affair destroyed his law practice. He was elected delegate to the South Carolina Democratic convention in 1844, but his violent temperament and behind-the-scenes meddling had already doomed his youthful political ambitions. He piled up medical bills because of a sickly infant son who eventually died. Sheriff sales followed, swallowing up his Edgefield estate. A Texas cousin, James Hamilton, Jr., a former governor of South Carolina, arranged for him a fresh start and a law partnership.\n\nWigfall's reputation as a duelist, often exaggerated, followed him his entire life, even though he gave up the practice entirely after his marriage. However, he would continue to claim the code duello was an important \"factor in the improvement of both the morals and manners of the community.\"\n\nArriving in Texas in 1848, Wigfall joined William B. Ochiltree's law practice at Nacogdoches, Texas, then settled in Marshall, Texas. He quickly dove back into politics, serving in the Texas House of Representatives from 1849 to 1850, and in the Texas Senate from 1857 to 1860. He became a staunch political opponent of Sam Houston. When Houston ran for governor in 1857, Wigfall followed him on the campaign trail, attacking his congressional record at each of Houston's stops, and accused Houston of being a traitor to the South. He claimed that Houston had ambitions for a presidential nomination and courted the support of Northern abolitionists.\n\nHe organized state Democrats to resist the Know Nothing party, but with their defeat his radical views descended in the estimation of Democratic moderates. John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry propelled him and his radical views back to prominence in the state.\n\nThe Texas legislature elected Wigfall to the United States Senate in 1859 as a Democrat to the 36th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James Pinckney Henderson. Matthias Ward was appointed to the Senate following Henderson's death and served from September 27, 1858 until Wigfall was elected and sworn in on December 5, 1859. Wigfall served until March 23, 1861, when he withdrew. He was expelled from the Senate on July 11, 1861 for support of the rebellion. He also served as a member of the Texas delegation to the Provisional Confederate Congress, which formed the provisional government of the Confederacy, and which selected Jefferson Davis as its president. Wigfall had continued to hold his seat after Texas had seceded on February 1, 1861 and was admitted to the Provisional Confederate Congress on March 2, 1861, exhorting the rightness of the Southern cause and berating his Northern colleagues whether on the floor of the Senate or in Capitol Hill saloons. During this time in Washington, he spied on Federal preparations for the coming conflict, secured weapons for delivery south, and upon expulsion by his fellow Senators, he went to Baltimore, Maryland and recruited soldiers for the new Confederacy before traveling to the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia.\n\nIn the days leading up to the start of hostilities, Wigfall advocated an attack on Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens in Florida to prompt Virginia and other upper southern slave states to join the Confederacy. In January 1865, Wigfall stated his reasons for having supported the Confederacy, namely, opposition to African American equality:\n\nHe arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, as the siege of Fort Sumter commenced. According to diarist Mary Chesnut, he was the only \"thoroughly happy person I see.\" While serving as an aide to General Beauregard during the bombardment of Fort Sumter, and without authorization, he rowed a skiff out to the island fort and demanded its surrender from Major Robert Anderson. The incident was widely reported in the newspapers furthering his celebrity, but the story redacted the important detail that Wigfall had not spoken to Beauregard in two days. When the \"authorized\" emissaries arrived at the fort, they were dismayed upon learning that Wigfall had granted terms to Anderson which Beauregard had already rejected.\n\nWith his newfound celebrity Wigfall secured an appointment to full colonel of the 1st Texas Infantry Regiment, and a rapid promotion thereafter to brigadier general of the \"Texas Brigade\" in the Confederate Army. He took up residence near his encamped troops in a tavern at Dumfries, Virginia, during the winter of 1861–1862, where he would frequently call the men to arms at midnight, imagining a Federal invasion. His nervousness was blamed on his fondness for whiskey and hard cider. He appeared visibly drunk, on and off-duty, in the presence of his men on more than one occasion. He resigned his commission in February 1862 to take a seat in the Confederate Senate, and was replaced by John Bell Hood.\n\nAt the beginning of the war Wigfall was a close friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Like political alliances throughout his career, he would first support then split with Davis as the war progressed. Davis supported an increasingly strong national government, while Wigfall, forever an advocate of states rights, moved to block the creation of the Confederate Supreme Court, fearing Davis' appointments would rule against the states. Wigfall also challenged Davis, a West Point graduate and former United States Secretary of War, on many of his military-related policies, citing his own military experience in the Seminole Wars. Wigfall was a close friend of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston and frequently proposed legislation on the general's behalf. He was also an early proponent of making Robert E. Lee commander of all Confederate armies.\n\nAt the conclusion of hostilities, Wigfall escaped back to Texas in the company of Texas troops with a forged parole, then went to London, in 1866 as an exile where he intrigued to foment trouble between Britain and the United States. He bought a mine in Clear Creek, Colorado, returning to the United States in 1870. He lived for a while in Baltimore, Maryland, and was in Galveston, Texas, in January, 1874. He died a month later of \"apoplexy\" and is buried there in the Episcopal cemetery.\n\nIn the 1992 alternate history/science fiction novel \"The Guns of the South\" by Harry Turtledove, Senator Wigfall serves as the running mate to Nathan Bedford Forrest on the Patriot Party in the 1867 Confederate Presidential Election opposing Robert E. Lee and Albert Gallatin Brown. The Forrest-Wigfall ticket lost by a narrow margin. The book uses real quotes of Wigfall.\n\n\n Retrieved on 2008-02-13\n"}

Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). He was also adapted as a character in \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\". During the early years of circulation of the \"Principia Discordia\", rumors claimed that the author of the book was Richard Nixon, Timothy Leary, or Robert Anton Wilson; or that the book and Malaclypse the Younger were both fictional inventions of Robert Anton Wilson, as with Abdul Alhazred's \"Necronomicon\".\n\nGregory H. Hill was born in California on Wednesday, May 21, 1941. He worked for Western Union while a young man in the Southern California area of Whittier, California.\n\nAround 1958 or 1959 while still a teenager, he, Kerry Thornley and others began working on the Discordian religion.\n\nIn 1965, the first edition of Principia Discordia was printed, allegedly in five copies. The most famous edition was the fourth.\n\nHill spent much of his life working for Bank of America as a computer programmer, and moved to the San Francisco Bay area. He had apparently visited there while a child.\n\nRobert Anton Wilson stated, in the lecture \"The I in the Triangle\" from 1990, that Greg Hill was at the time the head of a large computer facility owned by one of the largest banks in the United States.\n\nA designer of one of the early video games, Hill wrote about computers including editing a computer-oriented newsletter. He also published an article proposing using a computer to transmit signals to remotely control robots.\n\nHe was married to Jeanetta; they later separated and may have divorced.\n\nHe died in the San Francisco Bay area of California on the July 20, 2000. A long-time smoker, he died of cancer.\n\nIn 1994, he and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst were inducted into the Order of the Pineapple.\n\nGreg Hill described Mal-2 as a spirit sent into him by Eris that helped him write the \"Principia Discordia\" over the course of ten years in his early adulthood. An interview included in the fourth edition of the \"Principia Discordia\" by Loompanics Press reveals that Mal-2 left once the book was finished. He claims Mal-2 returned to leave a fifth and final edition consisting solely of a Western Union telegraph form filled with the letter \"M\". Greg Hill also reveals that he had access to Western Union forms when he worked at Western Union.\n\nIn 2006, a copy of the first edition of the \"Principia Discordia\" was claimed to have been discovered in the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection in the National Archives, proving Malaclypse the Younger to be Gregory Hill.\n\nPossessing many titles, including \"Omnibenevolent Polyfather of Virginity in Gold\", Malaclypse's true identity or position within the Erisian religion is completely unknown. He is frequently mentioned in the \"Principia Discordia\". Credited with wiring telegrams to God from the Celestial Hotel and decrying the usefulness of prayer, these claims are in the nature of the \"Principia Discordia\".\n\nVery little is known about Malaclypse the Elder, the namesake of Mal-2. The \"Principia Discordia\" merely mentions him as a \"non-prophet\" and that he was mistaken for a doomsayer when carrying a sign that read \"DUMB.\"\n\nMalaclypse the Younger also appears in \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. According to \"Illuminatus!\", he founded the Norton Cabal, and then left the cabal to join the very esoteric Erisian Liberation Front. The character Dr. Ignotum P. Ignotius says the last thing Mal-2 wrote before he left for the ELF was, \"Everybody understands Mickey Mouse. Few understand Hermann Hesse. Hardly anyone understands Albert Einstein. And nobody understands Emperor Norton.\" This is the slogan of the Joshua Norton Cabal of San Francisco.\n\nMalaclypse the Elder has an even larger role in \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\". In fact, he is an important shape-shifting character in the book, posing as Jean-Paul Sartre, Billy Graham, and the Devil. According to Malaclypse the Elder himself, he is a 4th century B.C. Erisian priest (who was also prepared to perform services to Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera) who achieved \"transcendental illumination\" in the course of the massacre at Melos in 415 BC. The Illuminati believe that death releases a certain form of energy. Given enough death and a person intent on capturing said energy, a person may be transformed into an immortal, immaterial being, or so the plot element goes. Malaclypse the Elder also posed as Jesus after Jesus was crucified. In the form of Jesus, he introduced Bingo, but asked Luke to not record it.\n\n\n"}

One of the plural wives of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, Lightner is credited with rescuing papers that were later published as part of the Doctrine and Covenants from anti-Mormon mobs.\n\nMary Elizabeth Rollins was born April 9, 1818, in Lima, New York, to John D. Rollins and Keziah Keturah Van Benthuysen. She was one of three children. Her father died in a shipwreck on Lake Ontario when she was a child. In 1828, she and her family moved to Kirtland, Ohio, to live with her uncle Algernon Sidney Gilbert. They lived there for two years. \n\nDuring that time, they learned about the church established by Joseph Smith. She was baptized into the church in October 1830. She was lent a Book of Mormon by Isaac Morley for one night. She and her family stayed up late reading it, and she had memorized the first verse by morning. When she went to give the book back to Morley, he was impressed at how much she had read and he let her keep it until she finished. At the time she read the Book of Mormon, Mary was eleven years old. Shortly after she finished reading the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith moved to Kirtland in February 1831. Smith was brought to her home and she received a blessing from him by the laying on of hands.\n\nIn the fall of 1831, she and her family left Kirtland for Independence, Missouri. Here Mary experienced the interpretation of tongues. She interpreted several sermons from other languages. She started working for Peter Whitmer Sr. as a seamstress. She met Governor Lilburn Boggs while working for Whitmer. Boggs tried to convince Mary to leave the church and live with them, but she refused. She recorded that many people persecuted members of the church in Missouri. Mobs destroyed their houses and set fire to their crops. She witnessed the tarring and feathering of Edward Partridge. \n\nMary also witnessed the tearing down of the printing press in Independence on July 20, 1833. She watched as a mob tore down the building and threw pages of the Book of Commandments into the streets. She and her sister grabbed armfuls of the paper, despite the mob pursuing them. They hid in a cornfield until the mob passed. They turned over the papers to Sister Phelps, the wife of W. W. Phelps. Later, some of the pages were bound and given to Mary. They were later published as part of the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nThe members of the church were forced to leave Independence and went to Clay County, Missouri, where Mary began teaching children how to read and write. She taught for two years. Her mother remarried, and Mary lived with her uncle Gilbert until he died in 1834. During this time, she also witnessed the expedition of Zion's Camp, and was reunited with Joseph Smith again. Smith later commented to Mary that in 1834 he received a revelation to marry her as a plural wife. But because of physical separation and distance, Smith did not pursue the marriage.\n\nMary Rollins was married to Adam Lightner on August 11, 1835. He was not a Latter Day Saint. They would go on to have ten children. They moved to Far West, Missouri, to open a store. The couple's first son, Miles Henry, was born in 1836. Towards the end of 1837, they moved to Milford, Missouri, just outside of Far West, to open another branch of the store. They faced persecution in Milford as well. She and her husband were requested to meet with a mob and their leader, a General Clark. They were told that Governor Boggs was going to destroy the city, but that he requested her family and another be safely evacuated first. Mary refused to leave everyone else behind. The next day, the mob took Joseph and Hyrum Smith but did not harm Far West.\n\nMary and her family went to Louisville, Kentucky, to visit Adam's brother, leaving their possessions in Far West. They rented a house there for six months. She was offered work as a seamstress, but refused because the pay was too low. She painted some pictures and sold them, and would go on to give many painting lessons to earn money.\n\nAlthough her family struggled financially, the Lightners traveled through St. Louis, Missouri, on their way to rejoin the Latter Day Saints in Alton, Illinois, where Mary's brother Henry was. On their trip, she taught painting lessons to a woman on board the boat. Mary continued giving painting lessons and found acceptable work as a seamstress when they moved to Farmington, Illinois, where they stayed for two years. They lost their money when their bank failed, and they went to live with Mary's stepfather, Mr. Burt.\n\nWhile their family moved many times, Mary often found work as a seamstress and a painting teacher. Some of her students included Julia Murdock Smith and Sarah Ann Whitney. The Latter Day Saints left the area of Nauvoo, Illinois. Before leaving, Mary recounts that Joseph Smith came to her family and her brother's family and told them to be rebaptized. All were baptized except her husband, who was not a member. Adam said that he did not feel worthy. In February 1842, Mary was sealed to Joseph Smith as a plural wife. In 1843, she was accepted into the women's Relief Society of Nauvoo.\n\nTheir family moved to Pontoosuc, Illinois. Joseph Smith was upset by this and told Mary that if they left the church, they would suffer hardships. Her son George died. Mary had her fourth child in May 1843. Shortly after, she became ill with \"inflammation of the bowels\". She stayed in bed, and woke up once to find everyone in her household lying on the floor as if they were dead. While she was in bed, lightning had struck the house. She and all members of the family eventually recovered. \n\nMen from Pontoosuc sought to kill Joseph Smith in June 1844. They made Mary make a flag for their company. While she refused, they threatened her and she made the flag. This group was part of the mob that attacked Carthage Jail, which resulted in the death of Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum. Mary's family was kept in Pontoosuc for three months and robbed of many of their possessions by these men. \nMary became sick again, and doctors said that she would die shortly. She felt the urge to go to Nauvoo to get a blessing from Alpheus Cutler, who worked in the Nauvoo Temple. Her friends and family feared that the trip would kill her, but she insisted on going. She did make it to Nauvoo and received a blessing and felt better within two weeks. \n\nMary received her endowment in the Nauvoo Temple on January 30, 1845. While earning money to make the trip to the temple, she was sewing and got half of a needle stuck in her arm, which doctors couldn't remove in June 1847. Previously, in the fall of 1844, Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball offered themselves as proxy husbands to widows of Joseph Smith. Mary accepted the offer from Young, and she and Young were sealed on May 22, 1845, in the temple.\n\nAfter having another son in February 1848, she took a job as a tailor. Her husband had a harder time finding work, and they were offered a job maintaining a hotel in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin. There Adam and their baby became very sick. Mary's leg swelled and she almost had her leg amputated. She records that she prayed for God to spare her limb. While living there, a man stopped by her house and offered her a medicine that would supposedly heal anything. Uninterested, but in an attempt to get the man to leave, she, her husband and her aunt tasted the medicine. She even gave some to her children. Within moments, they all became ill and two of her children died. The man had given them poison. The man was caught by authorities, but Mary begged them not to hang him. They were going to put the man on trial, but he escaped and was never tried. \n\nThe family bought a 65-acre farm near Lake St. Croix, Minnesota. However, they faced many hardships and several of their horses died. They accepted a job keeping a three-story hotel in Willow River, Minnesota, and stayed for two years. Mary left to take care of her sister Caroline who was sick and lived in Farmington in 1853; her sister died five weeks later. Mary took some of Caroline's children home with her to raise them. The family later moved to Maine in 1854 and opened their own boarding house. They lost their property in the Civil War.\nAfter suffering so many losses, Mary convinced her husband that they should rejoin the Latter Day Saints.\n\nAfter their hotel failed, they moved back to Missouri to Hannibal. After staying only a year, they returned to Minnesota where their tenth child, Adam, was born on October 28, 1862. they boarded the \"Canada\" headed for St. Louis on May 25, 1863 and began traveling westward. They were faced by threats from soldiers, Indians and plagues of sickness. They reached Omaha, Nebraska, and met up with other Latter Day Saints from England, South Africa, and Denmark. They traveled across the plains in a wagon company. They arrived in Salt Lake City, Utah on September 15, 1863.\n\nThe Lightners settled Minersville, Utah. In 1869, the Relief Society was organized there, and Mary was called to be its president. Mary's mother died in 1877, and Brigham Young died later that same year. After 1880, Adam was unable to find work. Mary wrote to church president John Taylor in September 1881, reporting that she needed financial assistance. In August 1884, Mary went to Salt Lake City to ask for help in person. Adam became ill and died on August 19, 1885. He never joined the church. He left Mary with over $100 in debt. Shortly after her husband's death, Mary's son was convicted of grand larceny. She worked hard to get her son Adam Jr. out of jail; he was released in June 1886. He died four years later. \n\nMary lived the rest of her life destitute. She may have suffered depression. She traveled occasionally to Salt Lake City. She relied on the church to receive money since she was one of Joseph Smith's widows. She did speak at meetings, sharing her life experiences about the early days of the church and her testimony. Mary spoke at the graduation ceremony at Brigham Young University on April 14, 1905. She was promised by Heber C. Kimball before his death that she would see Joseph Smith again during her lifetime. In 1905, she shared that she had been visited by Smith after his death. Mary Rollins Lightner died on December 17, 1913, in Minersville. At the time of her death, she was the last surviving plural wife of Smith.\n\nMary claimed that Smith had a private conversation with her in 1831, when she was only 12. He told her that she \"was the first woman God commanded him to take as a plural wife.\" He approached her in 1834 again; however, she married Adam Lightner on August 11, 1835. She admitted later that she had had dreams of being Smith's wife. She reported that Smith told her that an angel threatened to take away his life unless he followed God's instruction to practice plural marriage. He also predicted that her husband would not join the church and, therefore, she needed to be sealed to a priesthood holder. Mary would not marry Smith until she had received a witness from God for herself. She prayed about the proposal, and reported that she saw an angel pass through her room. Smith then told her that certain events would take place in her life, and they did. Mary consented to be married to Smith, although the sealing did not cancel her marriage to Adam. She was the sixth of Smith's plural wives. They were sealed in February 1842 by Brigham Young. At the time, Mary was pregnant with her son George. Mary mentions that her husband was away at the time of her sealing to Smith, so Adam's consent or knowledge is unclear. Smith's first wife, Emma Smith, knew about the marriage. Mary later reported that she knew that Smith had other children by his plural wives. Mary signed an affidavit in 1902 to document her sealing to Smith.\n\nAfter Joseph Smith's death in 1844, Mary was sealed to Brigham Young. The sealing was performed in the Nauvoo Temple on May 22, 1845. Mary recorded, \"I was also sealed to Brigham Young as proxy for Joseph.\" When Mary lived in Minersville, she records that Young stopped by to visit. She wrote to him and updated him on how her family was doing throughout her life. Through correspondence letters between Mary and Eliza R. Snow, it appears that Mary knew and was friendly towards other plural wives of Young.\n\n"}

Chaudhuri\n\nNirad Chandra Chaudhuri, CBE (23 November 1897 – 1 August 1999) was an Indian English-language writer.\n\nChaudhuri authored numerous works in English and Bengali. His oeuvre provides a magisterial appraisal of the histories and cultures of India, especially in the context of British colonialism in the 19th and 20th centuries. Chaudhuri is best known for \"The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian\", published in 1951. Over the course of his literary career, he received numerous accolades for his writing. In 1966, \"The Continent of Circe\" was awarded the Duff Cooper Memorial Award, making Chaudhuri the first and only Indian to date to be given the prize. The Sahitya Akademi, India's national Academy of Letters, awarded Chaudhuri the Sahitya Akademi Award for his biography on Max Müller, \"Scholar Extraordinary\".\n\nIn 1990, Oxford University awarded Chaudhuri, by then a long-time resident of the city of Oxford, an Honorary Degree in Letters. In 1992, he was made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\n\nChaudhuri was born in Kishoregunj, Mymensingh, East Bengal, British India (now Bangladesh), the second of eight children of Upendra Narayan Chaudhuri, a lawyer, and of Sushila Sundarani Chaudhurani. His parents were liberal middle-class Hindus who belonged to the Brahmo Samaj movement.\n\nChaudhuri was educated in Kishorganj and Kolkata (then, Calcutta). For his FA (school-leaving) course he attended Ripon College in Calcutta along with the famous Bengali writer Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay. Following this, he attended Scottish Church College, Calcutta, where he studied history as his undergraduate major. He graduated with honors in history and topped the University of Calcutta merit list. At Scottish Church College, Calcutta, he attended the seminars of the noted historian, Professor Kalidas Nag. After graduation, he enrolled for the M.A. at the University of Calcutta. However, he did not attend all of his final exams, and consequently was not able to complete his M.A.\n\nAfter his studies, he took a position as a clerk in the Accounting Department of the Indian Army. At the same time, he started contributing articles to popular magazines. His first article on Bharat Chandra (a famous Bengali poet of the 18th century) appeared in the most prestigious English magazine of the time, \"Modern Review\".\n\nChaudhuri left his position in the Accounting Department shortly after, and started a new career as a journalist and editor. During this period he was a boarder in Mirzapur Street near College Square, Kolkata, living together with the writers Bibhuti Bhushan Banerjee and Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder. He was involved in the editing of the then well-known English and Bengali magazines \"Modern Review\", \"Prabasi\" and \"Sonibarer Chithi\". In addition, he also founded two short-lived but highly esteemed Bengali magazines, \"Samasamayik\" and \"Notun Patrika\".\n\nIn 1932, he married Amiya Dhar, a well-known writer herself; the couple had three sons.\n\nIn 1938, Chaudhuri obtained a job as secretary to Sarat Chandra Bose, a political leader in the freedom movement in India. As a result, he was able to interact with political leaders of India: Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the brother of Sarat Chandra Bose, Subhas Chandra Bose (also known as Netaji). A growing familiarity with the workings of the inner circle of Indian politics led him to be skeptical about its eventual progress, and he became progressively disillusioned about the ability of Indian political leadership.\n\nApart from his career as a secretary, Chaudhuri continued to contribute articles in Bengali and English to newspapers and magazines. He was also appointed as a political commentator on the Kolkata branch of the All India Radio. In 1941, he started working for the Delhi Branch of the All India Radio.\n\nChaudhuri was a prolific writer even in the very last years of his life, publishing his last work at the age of 99. His wife Amiya Chaudhuri died in 1994 in Oxford, England. He too died in Oxford, three months short of his 102nd birthday, in 1999. He lived at 20 Lathbury Road from 1982 until his death and a blue plaque was installed by the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board in 2008.\n\nStudent historian Dipayan Pal wrote of Nirad C. Chaudhuri in The Statesman in 2016:\n\nHis masterpiece, \"The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian\", published in 1951, put him on the long list of great Indian writers. He courted controversy in the newly independent India due to the dedication of the book, which ran thus:\n\n<poem>\nTo the memory of the British Empire in India,\nWhich conferred subjecthood upon us,\nBut withheld citizenship.\nTo which yet every one of us threw out the challenge:\n\"Civis Britannicus sum\"\nBecause all that was good and living within us\nWas made, shaped and quickened\nBy the same British rule.\n</poem>\n\nThe dedication, which was actually a mock-imperial rhetoric, infuriated many Indians, particularly the political and bureaucratic establishment. \"The wogs took the bait and having read only dedication sent up howls of protest\", commented Chaudhuri's friend, editor, historian and novelist, Khushwant Singh. Chaudhuri was hounded out of government service, deprived of his pension, blacklisted as a writer in India and forced to live a life of penury. Furthermore, he had to give up his job as a political commentator in All India Radio as the Government of India promulgated a law that prohibited employees from publishing memoirs. Chaudhuri argued that his critics were not careful-enough readers; \"the dedication was really a condemnation of the British rulers for not treating us as equals\", he wrote in a 1997 special edition of \"Granta\". Typically, to demonstrate what exactly he had been trying to say, he drew on a parallel with Ancient Rome. The book's dedication, Chaudhuri observed, \"was an imitation of what Cicero said about the conduct of Verres, a Roman proconsul of Sicily who oppressed Sicilian Roman citizens, who in their desperation cried out: \"Civis romanus sum\".\n\nIn 1955, the British Council and the BBC jointly made arrangements to take Chaudhuri to England for eight weeks. He was asked to contribute lectures to the BBC, and wrote eight of these. His impressions of England and Europe were later collected in \"A Passage to England\". \"The Continent of Circe\", published in 1965, traces Chaudhuri's doggedly independent-minded ideas on the social, geo-political, and historical aspects of sub-continental India across millennia. An extended sequel to his famous autobiography, titled \"Thy Hand, Great Anarch!\" was published in 1988. His last book \"Three Horsemen of the New Apocalypse\", published in 1997, coincided with his hundredth year.\n\nAlthough he was highly critical of the post-independence Congress party establishment, Chaudhuri was more sympathetic to the right-wing Hindu nationalist movement in India. He refused to criticise the destruction of mosques: “Muslims do not have the slightest right to complain about the desecration of one mosque in Ayodhya. From 1000 AD every temple from Kathiawar to Bihar, from the Himalayas to the Vindhyas has been sacked and ruined. Not one temple was left standing all over northern India. They escaped destruction only where Muslim power did not gain access to them for reasons such as dense forests. Otherwise, it was a continuous spell of vandalism. No nation with any self-respect will forgive this. What happened in Ayodhya would not have happened had the Muslims acknowledged this historical argument even once.”\n\nChaudhuri was also deeply distressed by what he saw as the deep hypocrisy in Bengali social life and in particular those that resulted from class and caste distinctions. His historical research revealed to him that the rigid Victorianesque morality of middle class Bengali women was a socially enforced construct, that had less to do with religion, choice and judgment, but more to do with upbringing, social acceptance and intergenerational transference of values.\n\nHis prose was highly influenced by Sanskrit and the older version of the Bengali language, the \"Shadhubhasha\". He had little respect for the proletarian language, \"Choltibhasha\" (চলতিভাষা ) or \"Cholitobhasha\" (চলিতভাষা), which he regarded as being common in taste and scope. He avoided the use of words and very common expressions originating from Arabic, Urdu and Persian in modern Bengali.\n\nNirad C Chaudhuri is accused of being in secret connivance with the British and leaked information about the whereabouts of Sarat Chandra Bose. This may have led to arrest of Sarat Bose in 1941.\nDr. Radha Nag (রাধা নাগ) showed the conflict of the 'writer' Nirad C with the 'person' Niradbabu in her Bengali book আত্মঘাতী নীরদ চৌধুরী 'Atmaghati Nirad Choudhuri'(Suicidal Nirad Choudhuri).\n\n\nChaudhuri wrote the following books in English:\n\nHe also wrote the following books in Bengali:\n\n"}
{"id": "271950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271950", "title": "Paparazzi", "text": "Paparazzi\n\nPaparazzi (, ; ; singular: masculine paparazzo or feminine paparazza) are independent photographers who take pictures of high-profile people, such as athletes, entertainers, politicians, and other celebrities, typically while subjects go about their usual life routines. Paparazzi tend to make a living by selling their photographs to media outlets focusing on tabloid journalism and sensationalism (such as gossip magazines).\n\nPaparazzi tend to be independent contractors, unaffiliated with mainstream media organizations, and photos taken are usually done so by taking advantage of opportunities when they have sightings of high-profile people they are tracking. Some experts have described the behavior of paparazzi as synonymous with stalking, and anti-stalking bills in many countries address the issue by reducing harassment of public figures and celebrities, especially with their children. Some public figures and celebrities have expressed concern at the extent to which paparazzi go to invade their personal space. The filing and receiving of judicial support for restraining orders against paparazzi has increased, as have lawsuits with judgments against them.\n\nA news photographer named Paparazzo (played by Walter Santesso in the 1960 film \"La Dolce Vita\" directed by Federico Fellini) is the eponym of the word \"paparazzi\". In his book \"Word and Phrase\", Robert Hendrickson writes that Fellini took the name from an Italian dialect word that describes a particularly annoying noise, that of a buzzing mosquito. As Fellini said in his interview to \"Time\" magazine, \"\"Paparazzo\" ... suggests to me a buzzing insect, hovering, darting, stinging.\" Those versions of the word's origin are confirmed by \"Treccani\", the most authoritative Italian encyclopaedia, but sometimes contested. For example, in the Abruzzo dialect spoken by Ennio Flaiano, co-scriptwriter of \"La Dolce Vita\", the term \"paparazzo\" refers to the local clam, \"Venerupis decussata\", and is also used as a metaphor for the shutter of a camera lens.\n\nFurther, in an interview with Fellini's screenwriter Flaiano, he said the name came from the book \"Sulla riva dello Jonio\" (1957), a translation by Italian poet Margherita Guidacci of \"By the Ionian Sea\", a 1901 travel narrative in southern Italy by Victorian writer George Gissing. He further states that either Fellini or Flaiano opened the book at random, saw the name of a restaurant owner, Coriolano Paparazzo, and decided to use it for the photographer. This story is further documented by a variety of Gissing scholars and in the book \"A Sweet and Glorious Land. Revisiting the Ionian Sea\".\nBy the late 1960s, the word, usually in the Italian plural form \"paparazzi\", had entered English as a generic term for intrusive photographers. A person who has been photographed by the paparazzi is said to have been \"papped\".\n\nA transliteration of \"paparazzi\" is used in several languages that do not use the Latin alphabet, including Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, Russian, Thai and Hebrew. Chinese uses , meaning \"puppy squad\". Khmer uses (anak bramanh roub).\n\nDue to the reputation of paparazzi as a nuisance, several states and countries restrict their activities by passing laws and curfews, and by staging events in which paparazzi are specifically not allowed to take photographs. In the United States, celebrity news organizations are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nTo protect the children of celebrities, California passed a new bill in September 2013. The purpose of the bill is to stop paparazzi from taking pictures of children in a harassing manner, regardless of who their parents are. This law increased the penalty on harassment and the penalty for harassment of children.\n\nIn 1972, paparazzo photographer Ron Galella sued Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after the former First Lady ordered her Secret Service agents to destroy Galella's camera and film following an encounter in New York City's Central Park. Kennedy counter-sued claiming harassment. The trial lasted three weeks and became a groundbreaking case regarding photojournalism and the role of paparazzi. In \"Galella v. Onassis\", Kennedy obtained a restraining order to keep Galella away from her and her children. The restriction later was dropped to . The trial is a focal point in \"Smash His Camera\", a 2010 documentary film by director Leon Gast.\n\nIn 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed were killed in a limousine crash as their driver was speeding, trying to escape paparazzi. An inquest jury investigated the involvement of paparazzi in the incident, and although several paparazzi were taken into custody, no one was convicted. The official inquests into the accident attributed the causes to the speed and manner of driving of the Mercedes, as well as the following vehicles, and the impairment of the judgment of the Mercedes driver, Henri Paul, through alcohol.\n\nIn 1999, the \"Oriental Daily News\" of Hong Kong was found guilty of \"scandalizing the court\", an extremely rare law that the newspaper's conduct would undermine confidence in the administration of justice. The charge was brought after the newspaper had published abusive articles challenging the judiciary's integrity and accusing it of bias in a lawsuit the paper had instigated over a photo of a pregnant Faye Wong. The paper had also arranged for a \"dog team\" (slang for paparazzi in the Chinese language) to track a judge for 72 hours, to provide the judge with first-hand experience of what paparazzi do.\n\n\"Time\" magazine's Style & Design special issue in 2005 ran a story entitled \"Shooting Star\", in which Mel Bouzad, one of the top paparazzi in Los Angeles at the time, claimed to have made US$150,000 for a picture of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez in Georgia after their breakup. \"If I get a picture of Britney and her baby,\" Bouzad claimed, \"I'll be able to buy a house in those hills (above Sunset Boulevard).\" \"Paparazzi\" author Peter Howe told \"Time\" that \"celebrities need a higher level of exposure than the rest of us so it is a two-way street. The celebrities manipulate.\"\n\nIn 2006, Daniella Cicarelli went through a scandal when a paparazzo caught video footage of her having sex with her boyfriend on a beach in Spain, which was posted on YouTube. After fighting in the court, it was decided in her favor, causing YouTube to be blocked in Brazil. This caused major havoc among Brazilians, including threatening a boycott against MTV Brasil unless Cicarelli was fired from that company. The block only lasted a few days, and Cicarelli was not dismissed. The legal action backfired as the court decided she had no expectation of privacy by having sex in a public location.\n\nThe E! network program \"Celebrities Uncensored\" used often-confrontational footage of celebrities made by paparazzi.\n\nFollowing the publication of photographs showing Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing whilst topless at her husband's cousin's (Viscount Linley's) holiday home in France, it was announced on September 14, 2012, that the Royal couple were to launch legal action against the French edition of \"Closer\" magazine. It was the first time that a senior royal has sued in a court outside the UK. The reason cited for the legal action is that the Duchess had a right of privacy whilst at the home—the magazine responded that the pictures had been taken from the public highway. The injunction was granted September 18, 2012 and the publishers of the magazine were ordered not to publish the photographs in France and not to sell the images. The publishers were also ordered to hand over the original material of the published pictures under threat of a €10,000 fine for every day delay in doing so.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Sienna Miller, Amy Winehouse, and Lily Allen won injunctions that prevent the paparazzi from following them and gathering outside their houses. Miller was awarded £53,000.\n\nIn 2013, rapper Kanye West, facing assault charges for attacking a photojournalist, said he would fight to get the law changed so celebrities can profit from the paparazzi's work.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances in the United States with Worldwide Wrestling Associates (WWA) and the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF).\n\nDebuting in 1959, Morales originally came to prominence with WWA in the 1960s, where he held the World Heavyweight Championship and World Tag Team Championship. In 1970, he joined the WWWF, winning its World Heavyweight Championship and United States Championship. In a second run with the by-then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the 1980s, he won the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship and Tag Team Championship, establishing himself as the promotion's first Triple Crown Champion. He retired from professional wrestling in 1987.\n\nA popular champion, Morales had particular appeal to his native Puerto Ricans and the wider Latino audience. The first Latino to hold a world heavyweight championship, his combined reign as WWWF Heavyweight Champion remains among the longest in history. He also holds the record for most days as Intercontinental Champion. He was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1995, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2015 and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nWhen he was 17 years old, Morales trained under Barba Roja to become a wrestler and participated in a card held at New York in 1959, where he debuted by earning a victory over Howard LaVine, who performed under the pseudonym Buddy Gilbert, going on to participate in tag team matches and other stipulation matches throughout the tri state area the following year. The following two years, he made campaign in Virginia and North Carolina, particularly in the towns of Petersburg and Charlotte. Morales frequently wrestled fellow Puerto Rican Gypsy Joe in these cards, also earning wins over Jimmy Quinn, Don Savage and Sonny Fargo, while wrestling several local figures such as Swede Hanson, Laverne Baxter and Tony Nero. The following year, Morales began visiting several more states, often teaming with different Latin luchadores such as Pepper Gonzales and Gory Guerrero, while holding loose feuds with a wrestler simply known as “The Viking” and Mark Starr. As a traveling performer, he amassed mixed results, with most of his victories taking place in British Columbia, where Morales defeated Tarzan Potvin, Tony Nero, Bud Rattal, Tommy O'Toole and Johnny Demchuk in a two-month period, before losing three challenges to Oliver Winrush. After a similar result in a short program with Hard Boiled Haggerty, he had two draws against Allan Garfield, before defeating him on July 16, 1962. During the following months, Morales served as a midcarder, losing to several of the high-card talents but gaining wins over jobbers such as Poncho Pico, Sputnik Monroe and winning a three-fall match over Gypsy Biviano.\n\nIn August, Morales traveled to Texas and was involved in a series of matches with Jack and Jim Dalton, facing them along multiple tag team partners. After emerging victorious in a feud over Nelson Royal, he relocated to Washington, D.C. and Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he wrestled Miguel Torres, Angelo Savoldi and Lou Albano, while entering into a rivalry with Tony Altimore. It was here where he first teamed with Miguel Pérez, Sr. and Argentina Apollo, who were the first tag team champions recognized in the history of the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). Morales opened 1963 by performing in several tag team matches against Johnny Barend and Magnificent Maurice and returning to New York and New Jersey in a program along Gordo Chihuahua, who worked as enhancement talent. Later in the year, he formed a recurrent tag team with Perez and feuded with Pedro Rodriguez. In June, Morales joined Bruno Sammartino, Bobo Brazil, Perez and Apollo to once again enter a storyline with Johnny Barend, who was now joined by Diamond Jack. After this, Vittorio Apollo became his main stay tag team partner, along whom he challenged The Fabulous Kangaroos, Johnny Barend and Buddy Rogers on several dates. Morales finished the year by teaming with Pérez, earning three victories over the Fabulous Kangaroos. The team opened 1964 by feuding with Chris and John Tolos, losing the first two encounters but winning the three-fall rubber match. Individually, Morales defeated Chuck Martoni, Arnold Skaaland and Prince Nero on several occasions.\n\nThe tag team next entered a feud with Jerry Graham and Luke Graham, losing several times before earning a win on September 19, 1964. The team also exchanged results against Hans & Max Mortier. During this time frame, Morales picked singles wins over Frank Hickey, Chuck Martoni, Bobby Davis, Arnold Skaoland, Humberto Mercado, Matt Gilmore, Boris Malenko, Klondike Bill, Jose Quinteras, Magnificent Maurice, Bull Johnson and Luke Graham while losing in matches against Wild Red Berry and Freddie Blassie. Morales then entered a double feud against Pedro Rodriguez and Gene Kiniski, dominating Rodriguez but losing to Kiniski. Along Pérez, he retook their feud with the Grahams, picking a second victory. In the final months of 1964, Morales also gained wins over Robert Duranton and Steve Stanlee.\n\nHe opened 1965 by moving to Worldwide Wrestling Associates in California, an organization that had been created as a mirror to the National Wrestling Alliance, where he engaged in multiple concurrent feuds, defeating The Executioner in his first match, before going on to defeat several wrestlers with similar characters by winning against The Axeman twice, El Verdugo and The Hangman on several occasions during the first three months of the year. Morales also experienced success in matches outside storyline, besting Jesse Rose, Charlie Kalani, Ruffy Colden, Billy Red Lyons, Kenny Yates, Don Savage, Luke Graham, Hard Boiled Haggarty, some of them more than two consecutive times. In March, he was involved in a program with Karl Von Stroheim, winning a series of matches against him and teaming with Mr. Moto and Luis Hernandez to win tag team matches that also included Kurt Von Stroheim.\n\nOn March 12, 1965, Morales defeated \"The Destroyer\" Dick Beyer to win the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in a three-fall match. He continued earning singles victories over Horst Wessel, Kurt Von Stroheim, Al Marshall, Broadway Venus, Bill Cody and in a rematch against The Destroyer, while teaming along Hernandez to wrestle multiple combinations. He became involved in a feud against The Assassins and The Butcher, steadily gaining the upper hands both individually and in tag matches. Morales moved on from these angles and defeated Rod Orell, Billy Klutzer and The Mummy, before dropping the championship to Luke Graham on July 23, 1965. Morales responded by defeating Graham in a three-fall chain match less than a month later, in the process winning a Brass Knuckles Championship. Meanwhile, his team with Hernandez won three consecutive matches against The Assassins by disqualification. Subsequently, a revival of his previous feuds with The Butcher and The Assassins became intertwined with the current involving Graham, leading to a series of matches featuring different combinations during the following months. Hernandez was eventually replaced by Adalberto Torres as Morales's tag team partner, along whom he also faced Gorilla Monsoon and a variety of partners. On October 17, 1965, he defeated Graham to regain the WWA World Heavyweight Championship. Morales went on to defeat Graham in two more rematches, scoring victories over Ox Anderson, Bandito Lopez and Jack Allen as well. Following a short series against El Mongol, he continued this pattern in matches involving Swede Karlsen, Baron Leone, Killer Karlson, The Golden Terror, Mark Lewin, Killer Karl Kox and Clyde Steeves. Morales also won a battle royale held in Fort Worth, Texas and brought closure to his feud with El Mongol by besting him on February 13, 1966. During this stage, he also changed tag team partners frequently, teaming with Better Boucher, Ramon Torres and Billy Red Lyons among others, gathering mixed results.\n\nIn the final months before making a tour to Japan, Morales defeated Mark Lewin and Indio Joe, but also lost to Lyons and Mark Lewin. In his first show at Tokyo, he had a draw against Don Lewin. Morales continued this run by defeating Michiaki Yoshimura, Yoshino Sato, Mr. Moto, Mitsu Hirai, Umanosuke Ueda, tying against Kim Il in all of their encounters and losing only to Giant Baba by countout in singles. During this run, he teamed with Arman Hussein, Lewin, Wilbur Snyder, Lonnie Mayne & Billy Two, among others, with the results being divided inequitable manner between wins, losses and draws. On May 27, 1966, Morales returned to California and went on another winning streak over Ray Shields, Jack Lanza, El Mongol, Stan Neilson, Baby Destroyer and Fritz Von Goering, before entering a series against Buddy Austin, losing the first three encounters and dropping the WWA World Heavyweight Championship to him on August 5, 1966, before winning the fourth match. He also reformed his tag team with Luis Hernandez, finding success in this division as well by winning the WWA World Tag Team Championship on June 24, 1966, being a dual champion for over a month. After a win over Art Mahalik, Morales wrestled Hernandez to a three-fall draw. This was followed by victories over Austin and in a second battle royale. Despite gathering singles wins over the likes of El Mongol, Austin, Magnificent Maurice, Joe Flores and Frank Marconi, during the following months Morales focused on the tag team division, earning eleven wins, seven draws and only one loss before dropping the titles to Hard Boiled Haggerty and El Shereef on October 28, 1966. He subsequently split results against Shereef, also besting Rip Miller and Austin on several occasions during November. To close the year, Morales joined Mark Lewin to recapture the WWA World Tag Team Championship on December 10, 1966.\n\nMorales began 1967 by also teaming with Ricky Romero, Mr. Moto and Pepper Gomez, gathering victories along all of them. In singles, he remained in the top of the card, defeating Paul Diamond, El Shereef, Killer Karl Kox, K.O. Murphy and Johnny Vander, while wrestling Haggerty and The Mad Russian to draws. After winning two more matches along Lewin, their team ceased to exist, costing them the titles. Morales was then joined by Romero as his partner, once again winning the WWA World Tag Team Championship along him on February 10, 1967. The team went on to win almost a dozen matches, while he won contests against The Mighty Atlas, The Preacher and Mike DiBiase during the following months. Morales also ran a parallel team with Pepper Gomez, winning the American Wrestling Alliance World Tag Team Championship along him after winning their two previous matches. He made his first appearance in Hawaiian territory along Gomez on April 26, 1967. After returning to California the following month, Morales entered a series against his former partner Mark Lewin, but lost both encounters. He then continued team with Gomez and Romero, recording a successful run until they became part-time partners in July 1967, when he joined fellow Puerto Rican José Luis Rivera, immediately entering a long feud against Mike DiBiase, who teamed with a variety of wrestlers, but most frequently wrestled along Karl Gotch. While individually Morales entered a brief period where he recorded more draws and losses than wins, his team with Rivera won their first five encounters, which also featured him besting DiBiase and Gotch in singles. Concurrent to this, his team with Romero began experiencing more losses, while the one along Gomez remained consistently successful. While DiBiase and Gotch won in two consecutive events, the feud began to produce several draws. Morales and Rivera won the last encounter on August 16, 1967, then migrating to another rivalry against Freddie Blassie & Buddy Austin. Despite earning wins over several other teams, they were unable to best Blassie and Austin during this feud, only recording a single win. Individually, Morales gained victories over Tony Nero and Tony Altimore, both of whom eventually teamed and lost to the Puerto Rican team.\n\nHe challenged and defeated Blassie by himself, but lost in a rematch. Morales wrestled Pat Patterson in two tag matches, losing along Rivera but winning with Gomez. The team with Rivera dissolved afterwards, with another teammate emerging in the figure of Antonio Pugliese. Both of Morales' teams managed to record a successful run against an assortment of teams that included different combinations of opponents such as Stan Stasiak, Tom Andrews, Blassie, Austin, Patterson and Ray Stevens among others. Meanwhile, in one-on-one competition he bested Ron Romano, Baron Mikel Scicluna, Rick Renaldo, The Rebel and won an eight-man battle royale. Morales closed the year by rejoining Gomez as a full-time partner, defeating the team of Blassie and The Great Malenko. To open 1968, he defeated The Peacher, The Rebel and Blassie, briefly rejoining Romero in a draw. Individually, Morales then entered a streak of draws, before rebounding with wins over Rick Renaldo, Rocky Montero, The Alaskan, Lou Anthony, Rocky Montero and The Masked Invader. Antonio Pugliese reappeared on May 4, 1968, only to drop the WWA World Tag Team Championship to The Medics. A week later, Morales and Gomez also lost the AWA World Tag Team Championship to Kinji Shibuya & Masa Saito, but regained them on June 8, 1968. Mil Máscaras became a new member of the team, whom he joined in winning a series against Jim Osborne and losing another to Blassie and Austin. Morales made a one-night appearance in Hawaii during the summer, besting Pat Patterson. Both of Morales teams began having mixed results, which brought in another winning streak as a single wrestler which included names such as Fritz Von Goering, Texas, Osborne, Lou Anthony, Rick Renaldo, Thunderbolt Patterson, Tony Romano, Rocky Montaro and The Masked Invader before being snapped by Blassie via disqualification. On November 7, 1968, Morales challenged Gene Kiniski for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but failed to win the match. He won his next match by defeating George Cannon, forming a brief partnership with Hahn Lee that only lasted during for a month. In his final matches for the WWA, Morales defeated The Raider and El Mongol twice.\n\nNow a full-time performer for Mid-Pacific Promotions in Hawaii, he quickly entered a successful run with victories over Dave Ruhl, Austin and Tank Morgan. This resulted in Morales defeating Curtis Iaukea for the Hawaii Heavyweight Championship on May 21, 1969, and Kiniski for the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship less than a month afterwards. During this timeframe he also teamed with several wrestlers, including Gomez, Don Leo Jonathon, Dory Dixon and Ed Francis. Morales went on to defeat Austin and Kiniski in rematches, interrupting this run by unsuccessfully challenging Pat Paterson for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship in California. On October 13, 1969, he added the Hawaii Tag Team Championship to his other titles along Francis, holding it for a couple of weeks. After defeating Rocky Montero and Gorilla Monsoon, Morales dropped the North American Championship to Curtis Iaukea on September 24, 1969. However, in his following appearance he recovered the Hawaii Tag Team titles with Francis. After successfully teaming with Bing Ki Lee on three consecutive cards, Morales recovered the North American belt from Iaukea on November 5, 1969. In the final events of the year, he defeated \"The Original Sheik\" Ed Farhat, got disqualified twice against Tank Morgan and wrestled Johhny Barend. Morales began 1970 by wrestling in a series against Jack Bence, which later involved Bing Ki Lee and Tank Morgan. After defeating both Bence and Morgan, he returned to his feud with Barend dropping the North American Heavyweight Championship on February 7, 1970. Morales recovered by winning a match over Mac MacFarland and teaming with Bing Ki Lee to win the Hawaii Tag Team Championship from Barend and Ripper Collins. The team was successful in their next encounter against Kinji Shibuya and Mitsu Arakawa. After defeating Barend in a stretcher match, Morales defeated Les Roberts and advanced to the second round of the Strelich Tournament, a single-knockdown competition for the Strelich Perpetual Trophy, with a win over Woody Farmer. However, a loss to Don Carson in the quarterfinals eliminated him from the event.\n\nHe made a brief return to California, partnering with Freddie Blassie, but the team lost a series against Don Carson and the Great Kojika. Back in Hawaii, Morales defeated Bad Boy Shields, Mr. Fujiwara, Les Roberts and Mac MacFarland, only losing a match to Kinji Shibuya, during the following couple of months. In late May, Hard Boiled Haggerty arrived to the promotion. This reignited their feud in two encounters that favored Morales, who won a tag team match and tied in singles. Stan Frazier and Tony Borne were the next opponents that he bested during the summer. On July 1, 1970, Morales and Bing Ki Lee lost the Hawaii Tag Team Championship to Barend and Billy Robinson. In his next appearance, he joined Sam Steamboat and Hahn Lee in a win over Barend, Killer Karl Kox and Ripper Collins. In another tour to California, Morales lost to Black Gordman by count out and defeated Don Serrano, also teaming with Rocky Johnson for the first time to wrestle the Great Kojika and John Tolos. He then got disqualified in a match against Barrend and tied with Kinji Shibuya. On August 5, 1970, Morales regained the North American Heavyweight Championship from Barend. He was then involved in a series of matches involving John Tolos, whom he defeated in a tag team competition but lost in singles. During the following two months, Morales recorded a series of draws in matches against Ripper Collins, Billy Robinson and Kinji Shibuya twice. After snapping this streak with a win over Abdullah the Butcher, he dropped the North American Heavyweight Championship to The Destroyer. In his final two matches in MPP, Morales bested Jack Armstrong in a three-fall match and lost a 4-on-4 against Collins, Barend and The Destroyer while teaming with Sam Steamboat, Billy Robinson, Frank Allman and Hahn Lee. Returning to California, Morales began by defeating El Lobo on several encounters, also scoring wins over The Texan and John Tolos before losing the final of a one-night tournament for the NWA Pacific Coast Heavyweight Championship to Tony Rocca. During his final months in the West Coast, he defeated Karl Heisinger and Billy Graham, also participating in several tag team matches along Rocca and Ray Mendoza.\n\nMorales made his first appearance for the World Wide Wrestling Federation, now known as WWE, on November 21, 1970, by teaming with Chief Jay Strongbow in a draw against The Mongols, Newton Tattrie and Josip Peruzovic, as part of a one-night appearance. Now a full-time member of the WWWF roster, he joined Gorilla Monsoon the following month, scoring a win in a three-fall rematch. In his singles debut, Morales defeated Joe Turco. This was followed by wins over The Black Demon, \"The Wolfman\" Willie Farkas and Bulldog Brower during the following month. On January 7, 1971, Morales won the vacant WWWF United States Championship by defeating Blassie in a tournament final. A team-up with Gorilla Monsoon also took place in two draws involving The Mongols. On February 8, 1971, Morales defeated Ivan Koloff to win the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship only a month after winning his first individual title within the promotion. The move also vacated the United States Championship. This ignited a series of wins over the likes of Jack Evans and his previous opponents The Black Demon and Bulldog Brower. Subsequently, a series of victories in tag team matches involving Blackjack Mulligan evolved into a feud of single encounters, in which Morales won half a dozen events, before scoring two more team victories along Moonson. Meanwhile, The Wolfman and Bulldog Brower became recurrent enhancement talents during this run. Morales also scored wins over the likes of Beautiful Bobby and Tarzan Tyler, who eventually teamed up with Luke Graham, which turned into a double feud against both. Tyler, The Black Demon, Graham and The Beautiful Bobby were the opponents faced by him during a winning streak that extended throughout the summer. Different tag teams along Monsoon, Jay Strongbow and Manuel Soto experienced similar success. During August 1971, Morales scored several victories over Graham and Tyler, also besting them as a tag team and in a 3-on-3 match that included Lou Albano. However, in his final contest of the month he suffered a loss to Stan Stasiak. In September, Tyler and Graham brought in Jimmy Valiant as a teammate, which led to a series of matches including a win over him in a steel cage. On October 25, 1971, Morales defeated Stasiak in a Texas Death match. The following month brought wins over Tyler and Valiant, but also included an encounter where he bested Freddie Blassie and a continuation of the feud against Stasiak during the second half. During this timeframe, Rivera joined Morales in the WWWF, becoming part of his usual partners along Monsoon and Strongbow. He closed 1971 by defeating Blassie in a Roman Gladiator match, Ray Stevens, Stan Stasiak twice and The Rugged Russians along Rivera.\n\nFirst contender Blassie and Stasiak remained Morales' main rivals in the first two months of 1972, against whom he scored several draws and some wins. Graham, Valiant and Toru Tanaka served as enhancement talents. On February 18, 1972, Morales and Rivera defeated The Rugged Russians, continuing this parallel rivalry. March featured several different matchups, in which he emerged victorious against \"Baron\" Mikel Scicluna, Smasher Sloan and Rugged Russian #2, while consistently teaming with Rivera against Curtis Iaukea and Scicluna, both of whom he defeated individually throughout April. The following month feuds that ended in Morales earning several victories over Pampero Firpo, Tanaka, Iaukea and Albano. After disposing of Valiant, Graham, Scicluna and Graham again, the feud against Albano continued with wins in regular and steel cage matches. During June 1972, Morales also bested other notable opponents, including Nikita Mulkovitch, Blue Demon and Ernie Ladd. To continue this run, he defeated George Steele in New York. Following wins three wins over Tanaka and more against Firpo, Morales teamed with Sammartino on July 18, 1972, to face the former and Mr. Fuji. The match featured the two most popular wrestlers of the era, but finished in a no contest with both of the involved in a confrontation after Mr. Fuji threw salt in both of their faces, ensuing a fight. A rematch took place, this time in a team with Monsoon, but finished in a draw. Morales defeated both Tanaka and Mr. Fuji by countout and won the following two tag team matches. This was followed by a series involving Steele, Fuji, Ernie Ladd, Chuck O'Connor and \"The Spoiler\" Don Jardine, none of whom were able to gain an upper hand against him. On September 30, 1972, Morales faced Bruno Sammartino in the first-ever match featuring two fan favorite, technical wrestlers. The crowd favored him, despite Sammartino's large fan base in the city of New York. After 75 minutes of wrestling featuring several near-falls, the contest ended in a draw, when the city's curfew entered in effect. Subsequently, both performers embraced, signifying the end of their rivalry and the reformation of the tag team. However, the lack of a resolution was not well received, the fans were noticeably angry, and some jumped into the dugouts to shake their fists at the wrestlers. The main event of the 1972 Showdown at Shea later became known as \"The Match of the Century\" and is still regarded as one of the best events in the history of professional wrestling. After scoring a win over The Spoiler, Morales joined Sammartino in a rematch against Tanaka and Mr. Fuji, this time emerging victorious in a three-fall contest.\n\nThis was followed with a rematch, this time teaming with André the Giant. The Spoiler remained Morales most common adversary during the following months, which resulted in wins over him and his partner, Buddy Wolfe. Other wrestlers to fail their attempts were Ernie Ladd, The Sheik and Ray Stevens. To close the year, Morales defeated Tanaka individually and in tag team action, before going on to defeat Wolfe on several occasions. On December 2, 1972, he rejoined Rivera in a win. During the first months of 1973, Morales bested Mr. Fuji, Buddy Wolfe and Lonnie Mayne, as well as Hans Schmidt, Lonnie Mayne and Curtis Iaukea. He also teamed along Moonson, Bobo Brazil and Strongbow. A feud with Mayne went on to include a steel cage match. A series against Freddie Blassie concluded with three singles wins for Morales, also including a tag team contest. Throughout April and May, he successfully faced a number of recycled adversaries, including Mayne, Wolfe and Tanaka, along wins over new ones such as Don Leo Jonathan and Mike McCord. Morales also defeated Blassie twice, including a steel cage match. Throughout the summer, he performed mostly as a singles wrestler, gathering wins over Toru Tanaka, Paul Jones, Lonnie Mayne, Jonathan, McCord and George Steele facing them repeatedly in cyclical fashion. This trend was broken with the arrival of August, when Morales bested other figures including Blackjack Lanza and Stan Stasiak. During the month of September 1973, he was placed over Ib Solvang Hansen, McCord, Steele and Fuji. Morales went on to win a series against Lanza and a Texas Death Match involving Stasiak, before having Fuji serve as enhancement talent for the following weeks. On November 2, 1973, he made an appearance in AWA, winning a three-fall contst over Ray Stevens. Morales worked an angle with the then-villain Larry Hennig, besting him in singles. He followed this by entering a feud with Stasiak which featured mixed results, but concluded with him dropping the WWWF Heavyweight Championship on December 1, 1973. Morales' title run lasted 1,027 days, remaining to this date the longest reign by any Latino and the fifth longest overall. His reign was featured in independent film \"The Wrestler\", where footage of him was shown while two characters remarked \"C1: Morales... Eastern league champion. C2: And he is young. C1: He sure is good...\" as part of a discussion of dangerous adversaries that could be possible opponents for an aging wrestler. Following this, he returned in two tag team matches, before defeating Stasiak twice in three rematches. One of these matches was promoted by Sponsham wrestling and held at Roberto Clemente Coliseum. Morales remained successful as a singles wrestler, gathering wins over Fuji, Eddie Sullivan, Otto Von Heller, Johnny Rodz and Black Gordman during the first half of 1974. During the second half of the year, he bested Nikolai Volkoff and Strong Kobayashi, before exchanging results in a long-running feud against Killer Kowalski. In his final phase of this run for the promotion, Morales was victorious over Butcher Vachon, wrestling his final match on March 1, 1975.\n\nFour days later, Morales returned to California, wrestling for the NWA San Francisco territory. Despite now serving mainly as a tag team performer along Manny Cruz, Raul Mata, Pat Patterson, Cowboy Lang and The Haitian Kid among others, he also remained a singles attraction, gathering wins over Ricky Hunter, The Brute and winning a feud over Kurt Von Brauner during the following two months. Morales began the summer by teaming with Patterson on a consistent basis, sometimes alternating to include Peter Maivia, Don Muraco or a random wrestler. Their main opponents during this timeframe were The Invaders, against whom they exchanged results, with Morales and Patterson winning the NWA San Francisco World Tag Team Championship on October 29, 1975. Immediately afterwards, they became involved in a series against Don Muraco and Mr. Saito that lasted for the remainder of the year and from which they emerged with the best balance. To begin the following year, Mr. Saito and The Invaders were included in the feud, teaming with Muraco and Fuji on alternate events. The rivalry eventually shifted to singles competition, where Morales defeated Muraco on three dates before losing once. To close this run, he lost a contest to The Great Fuji by being counted out. Morales made two appearances in St. Louis, winning two tag team matches and defeating Ox Baker individually.\n\nOn October 30, 1976, he joined the AWA roster as a full-time performer. Returning to his former singles pace, Morales went on to immediately enter an undefeated streak over Bobby Jones, Moose Morowski, Buddy Wolff, Frankie Hill, Baron Von Raschke, Vito Martino, Ray Stevens, Pierre Poisson, Blackjack Lanza, Puppy Dog Peloquin, Rodeo Jones, Roger Kirby, Ray Stevens, Joe Carlos and Frankie Hill to close the year. To open 1977, he continued to trend in matches including Tom DeMarco, Mike Soma, Mad Dog Vachon, Baron Von Raschke, Poisson, Bobby Duncum, Moose Morowski and Jim Brunzell, also winning a battle royale and drawing in a series against The Super Destroyer. His streak continued the following month, this time over Bob Arnel and The Strangler, going on to include matchups against the opponents that he had already defeated. The feud with The Super Destroyer resumed shortly afterwards, this time ending with another draw and two wins for Morales. A rivalry with Nick Bockwinkel also took place in parallel, recording a no contest and a victory. After briefly teaming with Peter Maivia, Morales defeated Armando Rodriguez and entered a series against Alfred Hayes, which ended with a balance of five wins, two losses and two draws. Afterwards, he recorded mixed results in several contests against The Super Destroyer. In what marked the final stage of this AWA run, Morales continued defeating jobbers Mike York, Kenny Jay and The Strangler, but began losing more often to talent that he had bested earlier including Nick Bockwinkel and others such as Angelo Mosca.\n\nAfter migrating to Championship Wrestling from Florida, he immediately emerged victorious from a rivalry with Pat Patterson. In this territory, Morales’ tag team with Johnson became more active and defeated the team of Patterson & Ivan Koloff on five consecutive encounters. A second one along Don Muraco was not as successful, experiencing mixed results, but also winning more often than losing. During this timeframe, Morales also faced “Superstar” Billy Graham and Lars Anderson on a regular basis. On October 8, 1977, Morales unsuccessfully challenged Harley Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Afterwards, Koloff joined Mr. Saito as his main partner in the ongoing team feud, but both of the combinations with Johnson and Muraco were able to best them. Morales then teamed twice with Dusty Rhodes in a draw and a win against Lars Anderson & Killer Karl Kox, also teaming with Muraco one last time to defeat Koloff and Saito. On December 6, 1977, Morales wrestled Race for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, failing to win the belt. The following night he faced Race, Dick Murdoch, Baron Von Krupp and Mr. Sakuruda for the title, but was disqualified. To close the year, Morales earned singles victories over Buddy Roberts and Tank Patton. His team along Johnson opened the year by winning their first two matches, going on to defeat Koloff and Saito to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on January 24, 1978. Concurrently, Morales wrestled Anderson and divided honors in a series which included a win in the Superbowl of Wrestling. A feud with Killer Karl Kox ended in individual and team losses, a streak which ended costing them the titles. After recovering with wins over Koloff and Saito, Morales and Johnson regained the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on February 14, 1978. This reign was short, lasting only two weeks before dropping them to Saito and Mr. Sato. Morales then wrestled several singles matches, defeating Killer Karl Kox, Bobby Dumcum, Saito, Bob Roop, Jack Ruggers and Charlie Cook, dividing contests with Dick Slater and losing to Koloff. This was followed by three new partners, Tiger Conway, Jr., along whom he won four consecutive bouts, Joe Azzari, which led to two losses, and Jerry Brisco, who wrestled with him in two draws.\n\nOn May 5, 1978, Morales returned to Puerto Rico for one night and teamed with Rivera. Afterwards, Ron Mikolajczyk became a recurrent teammate, mostly in matches involving Butch Bronson and a chosen partner. During the following months, Morales scored wins over Len Denton, Butch Cassidy, Rick Oliver and Sir Winston, but lost to Killer Karl Kox, Dick Slater and The Spoilers. On June 23, 1978, he made a tour to New Japan Pro Wrestling, but only participated in tag matches. This was followed by a visit to Kansas, where Morales defeated Alex Perez and lost to Jesse Ventura. In October, he toured Germany, with a win over Amet Chong and losses to Kublai Khan. On November 11, 1978, Morales made a one night visit to California, teaming with Chavo Guerrero, Sr. in a win over Eddie Mansfield and The Grappler.

In singles competition, Morales defeated Mr. X #1, Brute Bernard and Morowski. A secondary teammate, Les Thornton, joined him in several victories, while Abe Jacobs and Johnny Weaver teamed occasionally. Eventually, Jay Youngblood became Morales’s main partner, recording a winning streak while he also teamed with several other wrestlers including Cocoa Samoa, Tiger Jeet Singh and Bob Marcus with similar success. However, as a single performer he lost matches to Nick Bockwinkel, Len Denton and Killer Karl Kox, also failing to advance in a tournament for the NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship. His victories during this timeframe were over Brute Bernard, Rudy Kay and Charlie Fulton. On November 8, 1979, Morales returned to NJPW, besting Kengo Kimura, Kuniaki Kobayashi, drawing with Tatsumi Fujinami and losing to Antonio Inoki. He also teamed with Singh and Bob Backlund in wins that included both Fujinami and Inoki, but lost along Greg Valentine in return matches. To open the following year, Morales relocated to Canada, where he defeated David Patterson, Mr. X #1, The Scorpion, Doug Somers and Brute Bernard, but lost a series to Ox Baker in alternate dates at South and North Carolina. In his final matches within the NWA circuit, Morales earned wins over Billy Starr, Frankie Laine and The Destroyer, both in singles and tag team matches.\n\nOn May 6, 1980, Morales returned to the renamed World Wrestling Federation, defeating Moose Monroe, Frank Savage, Mark Pole, Brute Bernard and Ben Alexander during the course of the following weeks. He formed a tag team with Bob Backlund, which won its first two contests. Meanwhile, Morales continued on his successful run with victories over Ron Shaw, Mikel Scicluna, Tor Kamata, Afa, B.B. Coleman, Johnny Rodz and The Hangman. On August 9, 1980, he won the WWF Tag Team Championship along Backlund by besting Afa and Sika, the Wild Samoans, at the Showdown at Shea 1980. However, they had to forfeit the championship belts the following day, due to a rule stating that no heavyweight champion could hold a second title at the same time. During the following month, Afa and Kamata served as enhancement talent, while Morales also participated in a battle royale. Afterwards, he went on to defeat several adversaries, including Larry Zbyszko, Scicluna, Afa, Rodz and The Hangman. A series with Patera intensified after a loss, with Morales recovering to defeat him to win the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on December 8, 1980. With this win, he became the first man in history to win the Triple Crown Championship, which along his United States Championship reign also meant holding all of the promotion’s titles during his era, a recognition that only he held for almost two decades. Morales also feuded with Sgt. Slaughter, defeating him by disqualification. During the early months of 1981, he continued defeating the likes of The Hangman, Ron Shaw, Jose Estrada and Zbyszko, but tied in contests against St. Slaughter and Stan Hansen. After defeating and drawing with St. Slaughter in another series, Killer Khan became Morales' most recurrent adversary, experiencing more success, while other names such as Greg Valentine and Hansen challenged him occasionally. This was followed by a short feud against The Moondogs, which ended with singles wins over both members of the team. On March 26, 1981, Morales faced Hulk Hogan, dominating throughout the match and winning by count out. The feud with The Moondogs resumed afterwards, with mixed results in tag team competition but another win over Moondog Rex. Another figure that became a mainstay was St. Slaughter, whom he often defeated by disqualification.\n\nJerry Johnson and Johnny Rodz served as jobbers during this run. After participating in a battle royale won by Angelo Mosca, the two entered a feud, from which Morales emerged victorious. During the month of June, he also scored consecutive wins over his former rivals Killer Khan and St. Slaughter, ending their respective storylines. This led to a feud against Don Muraco, to whom Morales dropped the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on June 20, 1981. Two subsequent rematches ended in one win, three losses and a draw. Morales began wrestling and defeating other adversaries, including George Steele, The Executioner and Larry Sharpe, besides the usual low card talents that he had consistently bested previously. However, the feud with Muraco was reignited and he earned two wins and a draw, leading to a titular rematch between them. Morales entered the contest with wins over The Executioner and Greg Valentine, winning the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship back on November 23, 1981, in a Texas Death match. With this win, Morales became the first man to hold the Intercontinental title twice, and he held it for fourteen months, the longest reign up until that point. He was successful in four rematches against Muraco, with Valentine systematically becoming his main adversary. In his first bout of 1982, Morales defeated Valentine by disqualification. He was able to dominate Hans Schroeder, Larry Dee and Killer Khan, but drew in another match against Valentine, who also went on to win their next encounter by disqualification. Their series continued with the equitable results of one win, one loss and a draw. To continue, Morales won two consecutive contests, including a Brass Knuckles Alley Fight, but got disqualified in the third. This was momentarily interrupted with a short program against Mr. Fuji, Mr. Saito and Lou Albano, which also featured wins over Rodz and Adrian Adonis. After being resumed, Morales won two more matches over Valentine, once again being disqualified in the third, before coming back to win in a Texas Death match. He then entered a winning streak, during which he defeated The Black Demon twice, Jesse Ventura by countout, Adonis thrice, Fuji and Valentine four times, two of these being Brass Knuckles Matches and other a Street Fight. This came to an end when Morales was disqualified against Jimmy Snuka. He wrestled Valentine three more times, winning in a Brass Knuckles match and by countout.\n\nDuring the summer of 1982, Morales feuded with Bob Orton, Jr., gaining the upper hand after being disqualified in the open bout. Estrada, Saito and Swede Hanson were also bested during this time. However, this streak was also ended in a count out loss to Snuka. In September, Morales won contests over Rocky Cole and Scicluna, but was counted out against Buddy Rose, which led to a draw in a rematch. He opened the following months with victories in matches featuring Bob Bradley, Tony Russo and Swede Hanson, but was counted out in a challenge by Superstar Billy Graham. Morales continued his feud with Buddy Rose, defeating him by disqualification. Two more matches against Graham ended in a draw and a disqualification loss. Afterwards, Morales was involved in a no contest and a double disqualification draw with Rose, going on to close with two consecutive wins. During the month of November, he divided honors with Graham, also scoring victories over Tony Russo and Fuji. On December 28, 1982, Morales wrestled Don Muraco to a double disqualification draw. On his first match of 1983, the result was repeated, this time in a match involving Graham. The following weeks brought wins over Sammy Sanders, Bob Bradley, Fuji and Rose, but also losses to Graham and Muraco, most of which were by countout or disqualification. After besting Graham in another bout, Morales dropped the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship to Muraco on January 22, 1983. However, he countered by winning a rematch, also defeating Graham before losing a second rubber match. Afterwards, Morales gained wins over Swede Hanson, Bob Bradley, Victor Rivera, Buddy Rose, Huertas Gonzalez and Fuji. He also emerged victorious from a feud with Graham, winning the majority of their encounters. Morales and Muraco went on to exchange results, but neither one was able to dominate cleanly, with most wins being consequence of count outs and disqualifications. Meanwhile, he bested Eddie Carson and participated in occasional multi-wrestler team matches. \n\nOn April 23, 1983, Morales began a tour in his native Puerto Rico performing for Capitol Sports Promotions (CSP), now known as the World Wrestling Council, challenging Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in his first appearance.\n\nAfter a brief interruption where he bested Swede Hanson in a WWF card held at New York, Morales returned to CSP joining Carlos Colón, Sr. to win the CSP World Tag Team Championship over The Medics. On June 25, 1983, he defeated Buddy Landel to add the CSP North American Heavyweight Championship. In a rare CSP card outside of Puerto Rican soil, Morales wrestled Hugo Savinovich in Trinidad. On September 10, 1983, The Medics recovered the titles from him and Colón. One week later, Morales faced Ric Flair in the first Aniversario event, winning the contest by disqualification.

This run was highlighted by a feud against Bob Sweetan, who injured Morales' neck with a piledriver during one of their encounters.\n\nDuring the months of March and April 1985, he participated in tag team matches for the WWF, including participation in a show held at Kuwait.

The second half of the month brought wins in two matches along Santana and singles success over opponents that he had previously wrestled. This pattern continued in November, when Morales and Santana exchanged results against Valentine and Brutus Beefcake. Individually, he gained victories over several familiar performers including Lee, Barry O, Gibbs and The Spoiler, also winning a series against Alexi Smirnoff and losing a single time to Orton. Contests including Moondog Spot, Thorton and Lee ended in the same fashion, with Morales going on to win a rematch over Orton. On December 12, 1985, Goulet scored a rare win over him.

His tag team with Santana remained successful, winning their contests throughout the summer. Meanwhile, Morales earned wins over Paul Christy, Roger Kirby, Lee, The Iron Sheik and Hercules, but began to lose more often against opponents such as Jake Roberts, King Kong Bundy and Savage. Like the year before, he entered the King of the Ring tournament, advancing with a win over Rudy Diamond. Morales advanced further by besting Mike Rotundo in the quarterfinals and Nikolai Volkoff in the semifinals, but lost the final to Harley Race. The following months brought mixed results, with wins over Muraco and Jim Neidhart but losses to Hercules and Adrian Adonis.\n\nMorales recovered by defeating Savage three times and Gibbs once, while drawing with Orton before losing a rematch to Race.

In December, Morales bested Jimmy Jack Funk, Volkoff, Frenchy Martin and Bravo, but also featured an unsuccessful rivalry with Race. He opened 1987 with a win over Bret Hart, before teaming with Santana twice with mixed results.

He lost a series of matches against Bravo, but bested Muraco before entering a feud with Nick Kiniski that featured several draws before he gained the upper hand in the final bout. Despite this, during this stage of his career Morales was unable to gain wins over the likes of King Kong Bundy and Bravo, unsuccessfully challenging the new Intercontinental Champion, The Honky Tonk Man, on several dates. Some wrestlers that he had bested in the past, such as Butch Reed or Sika were also booked over him, along strong adversaries such as Jake Roberts, Bravo, Oron and Paul Orndorff. His wins over this timeframe were over Moondog Spot, Sika and Jimmy Jack Funk. On March 8, 1987, Morales teamed with Danny Spivey in the quarterfinals of a tournament for the World Tag Team Championship, but were eliminated by Rick Martel and Tom Zenk.

During July, he bested Martin twice, also losing to One Man Gang and Orndorff. Morales made a final in-ring appearance by participating in a battle royale held on November 16, 1987.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the squared circle, Morales became a road agent and later commentator for the WWF's Spanish-language programming, the first time that a Puerto Rican performed this duty for an international promotion. He returned to this role working for World Championship Wrestling during the 1990s, narrating \"Nitro\" and pay per views along Miguel Alonzo. This accomplishment has since been mimicked by Jack Meléndez and Willie Urbina.\n\nMorales has made few wrestling related appearances since his WCW days, the most recent being autograph signings in fan conventions, the first instance was at Wrestling Reunion III held in 2005 and the second at Wrestling Reunion 5 held in 2007, where he was reunited with Sammartino. Despite living a low profile life following his retirement, he has been the inspiration for homages and mentions throughout the decades that followed. Morales has explained that he is no longer involved with the discipline due to the way that it has changed over the years. A self-proclaimed \"old school\" wrestler, he is not interested in the overselling of gimmicks and spectacle that is seen in modern professional wrestling, despite admitting the economic success of the \"sports entertainment\" formula.\n\nMorales was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame as part the class of 1995. Professional wrestling critics and purists have discussed his contributions to the discipline in widespread publications. Tomás Marín Rodríguez \"El Martillo\", part of a group led by José Antonio Geigel and one of the founding members of the first promotion in Puerto Rico, expressed in an interview that he considers Morales the best Puerto Rican wrestler in history. Marín considered that both his in-ring style and chivalry made him \"unique\" among performers. Terry Funk, Stan Hansen, Greg Valentine and Magnificent Muraco have expressed having enjoyed working matches with Morales. Fernwood Gold III and Thor Jensen of UGO Networks listed him as the 36th best face wrestler in history, noting how he appealed to the fanbase in New York. His run as the first Latin American Intercontinental Champions is universally lauded. Bill Barnwell of IGN Sports also included Morales in the site's list of Top Intercontinental Champions, placing him in the sixth slot. Jeremy Thomas of 411.com ranked him fifth as part of a debate among the website's staff. In a similar discussion held at Slam! Sports, writer Greg Oliver considered him the best wrestler to hold the belt, stating that when \"he held the title, there was a sense of honour and pride with it\". WWE itself ranks Morales in the ninth spot in the \"Intercontinental Champions\" entry of their Top 25 series. The promotion mentions being the first wrestler to win the title twice and holding it for a combined record of over 600 days, more than any other wrestler, as merits for this recognition. WWE also included him in a compendium titled \"Top 50 Good Guys in Wrestling History\", which featured wrestlers that performed as fan favorites during their careers. In September 2016, the promotion joined NBC Universo to commemorate National Hispanic Heritage Month, creating a series highlighting the career of several wrestlers including Morales.\n\nOutside of the WWE, he has received recognition as a Latin American and Hispanic pioneer in other promotions. In mid 1996, Morales appeared at an event of the short lived American Wrestling Federation, in the championship match between Bob Orton, Jr. and Tito Santana, along with other superstars and legends like Sgt. Slaughter, Chris Adams, and special guest referee Jim Brunzell. On August 31, 2006, as part of a Total Nonstop Action Wrestling taping, Morales was mentioned by Konnan along fellow Hall of Famers Carlos Colón, Mil Máscaras and the Guerrero family, being acknowledged as Latinos that paved the way within the wrestling industry. This was part of an in-character celebratory speech following The Latin American Xchange's coronation as NWA World Tag Team Champions. In reality, Konnan credits him with \"[teaching] a lot\" about the politics of wrestling and \"the things you need to do in the ring to be a success in this business\" during his time in WCW. From 2003 onwards, the World Wrestling Council approached Morales and offered holding an Aniversario event in his honor, but he declined the invitations for ten years. In 2013, Morales accepted being the honoree of Aniversario 40. He was the centerpiece of the International Pedro Morales Fan Club, an independent organization that ran during the 1970s and that recruited members through wrestling magazines. In 2000, \"The Ring Chronicle\" inducted Morales into its own version of the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. Modern fan reaction has also been positive in regards to the historical significance of his accomplishments. Nate Scaccia, collaborator of Bleacher Report, considers Morales the best Intercontinental champion of all time, ranking first in the title's entry at the website's WWE Champion Series. Michael Robinson and Will Baker, amateur writers for the same site, also consider him the 31st best WWE wrestler in history and 11th greatest WWE Champion respectively. He repeated at the ninth place in a subsequent interpretation. Besides the wrestling and sports media, the mun2 network also featured Morales in an article that listed their selection for the \"20 of the most memorable Latino wrestlers in WWE history\" which was published in 2012. When compiling a list based on the \"[wrestler's] impact on the [Puerto Rican] fanbase\", Raúl Álzaga of \"Primera Hora\" listed him third overall.\n\nAs a trainer, Morales was involved in the instruction of Dory Funk Jr., a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion who in 2009 was inducted into the Hall of Fame as part of The Funks.\n\nMorales was born in the municipality of Culebra, an island extending eleven square miles located off the shore of Puerto Rico's main island. He was a member of a large family, with 85 cousins just on his mother's side. Morales once claimed that sixty five percent of Culebra's population had some bloodline connection to him. He was raised in Culebra throughout his childhood and remained there until reaching his adolescence, when his mother sent him to live with an aunt in Brooklyn, New York to finish his high school education. It was there that one of his sister's friends introduced him to the members of a wrestling club, quickly earning an interest. After practicing in his school and at a local YMCA, Morales debuted as an amateur wrestler at the age of 13, competing in the 160 lb division. In New York he also became a professional wrestling fan, witnessing Miguel Pérez, Sr.'s run as one half of the only undefeated NWA Capitol (WWWF's predecessor) World Tag Team Champions along Antonino Rocca. Since early in his life, Morales had displayed aptitude for athletic competitions, mostly focusing in the practice of baseball. When he was 16 years old, he was selected in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico's (now known as Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente) first year draft by the Leones de Ponce. However, due to living outside of Puerto Rico he declined the opportunity. Instead, Morales elected to train in order to become a professional wrestler, in the process gaining twenty pounds. A year later, his father signed the documentation required by the New York State Athletic Commission in order to begin his career as an underage performer.\n\nHe married his wife Karen in 1966, continuing this relationship throughout his wrestling career and afterwards. The couple has a son, Pedro Morales, Jr. born in 1974. Due to the nature of his work, Morales had lived in over a dozen cities throughout his career, including some time in Japan. However, when his son was about to start kindergarten, the family bought a house in Central New Jersey. His wife, a teacher herself, began working at Avenel Street Elementary School. After his last job in pro wrestling as a Spanish narrator in WCW, Morales retired from the sport and permanently settled in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey where he adopted gardening as a hobby, cultivating tomatoes in his personal garden. Due to working during a time where the ring featured no methods of protection, Morales suffered several injuries that continued to linger after his career was over, limiting the amount of physical exercise that he was capable of doing. However, he remained a frequent visitor to The Club, a gym located in Woodbridge. Despite being a resident of this area, he continued to travel frequently to Puerto Rico, visiting the archipelago multiple times per year. In 2003, he expressed interest in returning to live permanently in a coastal town near the Caribbean Sea once his wife retired. However, this has yet to materialize. An advanced case of Parkinson's disease now prevents him from traveling to Puerto Rico.\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n"}

He was one of the first craftsmen to make small ornamental \"Taschenuhren\", portable clocks which were often worn as pendants or attached to clothing, regarded as the first watches. Many sources also erroneously credit him as the inventor of the mainspring.\n\nLittle is known about Henlein's life. He apparently apprenticed in his youth as a locksmith. At the time, locksmiths were among the few craftsmen with the skills and tools to enter the new field of clockmaking, and Henlein also became a clockmaker. On September 7, 1504, he was involved in a brawl in which a fellow locksmith, George Glaser, was killed. He sought asylum at a local Franciscan monastery, where he stayed for four years, until 1508. In 1509 he became a master in the city's locksmith guild. \n\nHe became known as a maker of small portable ornamental spring-powered brass clocks, very rare and expensive, which were fashionable among the nobility of the time. These were sometimes worn as pendants or attached to clothing, and so may be considered the first watches, although at over 3 inches long they were bigger than the first true pocketwatches which appeared about a century later, and were not able to fit in pockets. \n\nHe is mentioned in the city's records as the supplier of small spring-driven clocks, which were given as gifts to important people. He was supposedly the first craftsman to build clockworks into \"Bisamköpfe\", small containers fashioned from precious metals for fragrances or disinfectants. For example a Nuremberg paper records that in 1524 he was paid 15 florins for a gilt musk-ball watch. He also built a tower clock for Lichtenau castle in 1541, and was known as a maker of scientific instruments.\n\nHenlein's fame is mostly due to a passage by Johann Cochläus in the 1511 \"Cosmographia\" by Pomponius Mela:\nPeter Hele, still a young man, fashions works which even the most learned mathematicians admire. He shapes many-wheeled clocks out of small bits of iron, which run and chime the hours without weights for forty hours, whether carried at the breast or in a handbag\nHis reputation as the inventor of the watch came after his rise to popular consciousness in the 19th century, through a novel by Karl Spindler, \"Der Nürnberger Sophokles\". This was made into a 1939 film, and his likeness appeared on a 1942 German stamp. \n\nHowever, although he was a notable and talented clockmaker, there were other clockmakers making small clocks at the time, and no contemporary source from his time credits him with inventing anything. The mainspring which made portable clocks possible, often attributed to him, actually appeared in the early 15th century, almost a century before his work. Perhaps the most that was said of him by his peers comes from Johann Neudorfer in 1547 shortly after his death:\nThis . . . Henlein was very nearly the first of those who invented how to put small clocks into little boxes.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended Thurgoland Church School, and on leaving instead of following his father into farming, he became a coal miner at Glass Houghton. Active in the Yorkshire Mine Workers' Association, he became Secretary of his branch of the Union in 1911. He was elected as a Labour Party candidate to Castleford Urban District Council in 1914.\n\nIn 1924 Brooks was appointed Chairman of Wakefield and Pontefract War Pension Committee and made a Justice of the Peace for the West Riding of Yorkshire.

Thomas John Chilton (a slave-owning Baptist minister) and Margaret Bledsoe, sister of Jesse Bledsoe. He was a younger brother of Thomas Chilton, Representative from Kentucky and ghost writer of an \"autobiography\" by David Crockett. When Chilton was 14 months old his large family was among the victims of the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes. As a teenager he left home to live in Tennessee with an older sister, Jane, and her husband Charles Metcalfe. He read law with Return J. Meigs III in Athens, Tennessee, passed the bar in 1828, and began to practice law.\n\nIn 1831 Chilton moved to Talladega, Alabama. In 1839 he was elected as a Whig to represent his county in the Alabama House of Representatives. Chilton campaigned vigorously for William Henry Harrison in 1840 and Henry Clay in 1844. In 1843 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress. While practicing law in Talladega, he tutored his brother-in-law John Tyler Morgan, who passed the bar in 1845. In 1846 he established a law school in Tuskegee. On December 31, 1847 the state legislature elected Chilton an Associate Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. He became Chief Justice December 2, 1852 and served until January 2, 1856. After retiring from the bench, he established a law partnership with William Lowndes Yancey. In 1859 he was elected to the state Senate from Macon County.\n\nChilton originally opposed secession, but once Alabama decided to join the Confederate States of America he became a supporter. Elected to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States, which met in Montgomery on February 4, 1861 it was Chilton's task to call the convention to order as the representative of the district where the body met. After electing Howell Cobb as presiding officer, on February 9 the Provisional Congress elected Jefferson Davis as President. On February 18, Davis arrived in Montgomery to take his oath of office; he was escorted into the capitol building by Chilton and Robert Rhett. After Davis completed his speech to the Provisional Congress, in which he indicated that he would accept the presidency, Chilton made a motion that the body adjourn and then reconvene on the front steps of the capitol, making possible the well-known photos of Davis taking his oath of office. Members of the Provisional Congress were divided on the choice of a permanent capital. Chilton advocated for Montgomery so forcefully that earned disaffection of colleagues who advocated for Richmond, Virginia, which was eventually chosen.\n\nChilton won election to the First and 2nd Confederate States Congress. After the war he returned to Montgomery, both physically worn out from his legislative service and in constrained financial circumstances. When the Confederate Congress was not in session Chilton served as a private in Harrison's Company of Alabama Rebels, a home guard unit.\n\nAfter the war Chilton returned to practicing and teaching law; by 1870 he had managed to recoup most of his financial losses. He was also elected Grand Master of Alabama's Masonic Grand Lodge. In late 1870 or early 1871 Chilton was injured in a fall down the stairs. He died at his home in Montgomery on January 20, 1871.

{"id": "577173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577173", "title": "Wovoka", "text": "Wovoka\n\nWovoka (c. 1856 - September 20, 1932), also known as Jack Wilson, was the Paiute religious leader who founded a second episode of the Ghost Dance movement. Wovoka means \"cutter\" or \"wood cutter\" in the Northern Paiute language.\n\nWovoka was born in the Smith Valley area southeast of Carson City, Nevada, around 1856. Quoitze Ow was his birth name. Wovoka's father was Numu-tibo'o (sometimes called Tavibo), who for several decades was incorrectly believed to be Wodziwob, a religious leader who had founded the Ghost Dance of 1870. From the age of eight until almost thirty Wovoka often worked for David Wilson, a rancher in the Yerington, Nevada area, and his wife Abigail, who gave him the name Jack Wilson when dealing with European Americans. David Wilson was a devout Christian, and Wovoka learned Christian theology and Bible stories while living with him.\n\nOne of his chief sources of authority among Paiutes was his alleged ability to control the weather. He was said to have caused a block of ice to fall out of the sky on a summer day, to be able to end drought with rain or snow, to light his pipe with the sun, and to form icicles in his hands.\n\nWovoka claimed to have had a prophetic vision during the solar eclipse of January 1, 1889. Wovoka's vision entailed the resurrection of the Paiute dead, and the removal of whites and their works from North America. Wovoka taught that in order to bring this vision to pass, the Native Americans must live righteously and perform a traditional round dance, known as the Ghost Dance.\n\nAnthropologists, historians, and theologians alike provide conflicting accounts on when and how Wovoka had his vision. One scholar of religions, Tom Thatcher, cites James Mooney's Smithsonian-sponsored anthropological report to claim that Wovoka received his first vision while chopping wood for David Wilson in 1887. Conversely, historian Paul Bailey utilized Mooney's work along interviews with Wovoka's contemporaries and interpreters to assert that he received the vision after entering a two-day trance, awaking in tears. Regardless, shortly after receiving the vision and its message, it moved quickly beyond his local Paiute community by word of mouth to Native American tribes further east, notably the Lakota.\n\nThe Ghost Dance movement is known for being practiced by the victims of the Wounded Knee Massacre. Before the Ghost dance reached Native Americans on South Dakota plains reservations, interest in the movement came from U.S. Indian Office, U.S. War Department, and multiple Native American tribal delegations. Many tribes would arrive in Mason to listen to Wovoka intently, but language barriers existed. Visiting tribes came from different cultures, geographies, and linguistic traditions. Few delegation members could speak Wovoka's mother tongue of Paiute. This led to tribes adopting a militant form of Wovoka's teachings that emphasized an impending battle leading to the creation of the Ghost Shirts worn by Sioux and Lakota at the subsequent massacre. Other Native American Leaders, such as Miniconjou, Short Bull and Kicking Bear allegedly adopted violent interpretations that emphasized the possible elimination of whites. However, Wovoka never left his home in Nevada to become an active participant in the dance's dissemination in the U.S. interior.\n\nIndian Agents, soldiers, and other federal officials were predisposed towards a militaristic posture and outright violence upon encountering the movement.\n\nWovoka was disheartened by how events unfolded at the massacre. He still remained a prominent Native American leader until his death. Sometime between 1894-1896, he was reported to have been a sideshow attraction at a San Francisco Midwinter Fair Carnival. In 1917, an agent for the Nevada Agency named L.A. Dorrington tracked down Wovoka to report on his whereabouts to Washington. Curious to see if the former Native American messiah had any ties to Native American Peyotism, Dorrington found that Wovoka was instead living a humble life in Mason. He abstained from the practice, worked as an occasional medicine man, and traveled to events on reservations across the United States.\n\nWovoka died in Yerington on September 20, 1932, and is interred in the Paiute Cemetery in the town of Schurz, Nevada.\n\nNative American band Redbone named their 1973 album \"Wovoka\", and the title song, after the prophet.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended Harvard's Indian College and worked as an apprentice at Samuel Green's printing press, \"The Cambridge Press\", beginning in 1659. There, he became known by the English name, James Printer. In addition to the Indian Bible, Wowaus assisted Samuel Green in printing many of the Algonquian-language texts that were in circulation throughout the American colonies from 1658 to 1710.\n\nIn his late life, Wowaus was a teacher in Hassanemesit. His son, Ami, signed the deed that sold the last of the Hassanamesit tribal lands to the in 1727.\n\n"}

After a brilliant career as a student, he entered the Church, this being the best way to attain a distinguished position. In 1751 he became a doctor of theology, though there were doubts as to the orthodoxy of his thesis. In 1752 he was appointed grand vicar to the Archbishop of Rouen. After visiting Rome, he was made Bishop of Condom (1760), and in 1763 was translated to the archbishopric of Toulouse. His many famous friends included A. R. J. Turgot, André Morellet and Voltaire, and in 1770 he was elected to the Académie française. He was three times head of the \"bureau de jurisdiction\" at the general assembly of the clergy. He also took an interest in political and social questions of the day, and addressed to Turgot a number of \"memoires\" on these subjects, one of them, treating of pauperism, being especially remarkable.\n\nIn 1787, in the Assembly of Notables, he led the opposition to the fiscal policy of Calonne. He was then appointed head of the \"conseil des finances\" in April. Once in power, he succeeded in making the \"parlement\" register edicts dealing with internal free trade, the establishment of provincial assemblies and the redemption of the corvée. In May 1788 the process of tax collection was faulting and the loyalty of the army was slipping. As a result, Louis XVI suspended parliaments in May 1788 and created 47 courts. When the \"parlement\" refused to register edicts on the stamp duty and the proposed new general land-tax, he persuaded Louis XVI to hold a \"lit de justice\", to enforce their registration. To crush the opposition to these measures, he persuaded Louis to exile the \"parlement\" to Troyes (18 August 1787). When the \"parlement\" agreed to prolong the direct tax on all kinds of income, he recalled the councillors to Paris. A further attempt to force the \"parlement\" to register an edict for raising a loan of 120 million livres met with determined opposition. The struggle of the \"parlement\" against the incapacity of Brienne ended on 8 May in its consenting to an edict for its own abolition, with the proviso that the Estates-General should be summoned to remedy the disorders of the state. He resigned as finance minister on 25 August 1788.\n\nBrienne, who had in the meantime been made Archbishop of Sens, now faced almost universal opposition. He was forced to suspend the \"Cour plenière\" which had been set up to take the place of the \"parlement\", and to promise that the States-General should be summoned. Even these concessions were not enough to keep him in power, and on 29 August he had to retire, leaving the treasury empty. On 15 December following, he was made a cardinal, and went to Italy, where he spent two years. After the outbreak of the French Revolution he returned to France, and took the oath of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790. He was repudiated by Pope Pius VI, and in 1791 had to give up the biretta. He was also one of the few prelates of the old regime to swear the civic oath required by the revolutionary civil constitution.\n\nHe retired to an abbey confiscated in the Revolution. He repudiated Catholicism in 1793, at the height of the French Revolution.\n\nBoth his past and present conduct made him an object of suspicion to the revolutionaries; he was arrested at Sens on 9 November 1793, and died in prison, either of an apoplectic stroke or by poison.\n\nThe chief works published by Brienne are:\n\n"}
