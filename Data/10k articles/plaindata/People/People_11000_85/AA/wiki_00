He was the younger brother of Louis Philippe, later King of the French. Antoine had a deep affection for him, and they were only ever separated during the Reign of Terror and the events that followed between 1793 and 1797.\n\nIn 1791, Antoine Philippe was appointed an aide-de-camp, with the rank of sous-lieutenant in his brother's regiment (his brother, then duc de Chartres, was known as \"Général Égalité.\") He was made adjutant-general before the battle of Jemmapes, in which both he and his brother fought. In Paris at the time of the trial of Louis XVI, Antoine Philippe attempted unsuccessfully to persuade his father not to vote for the king's death.\n\nIn April 1793, whilst adjutant-general in the \"armée du Var\", Antoine Philippe was arrested at the same time as the other Bourbons who had remained in France. He was imprisoned in Fort Saint-Jean at Marseille.\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Antoine Philippe contracted the tuberculosis that eventually killed him. He also had an illegitimate child with Françoise Barbaroux — a son called \"Jean-Antoine-Philippe Dentend\" (7 July 1797 – 5 March 1858)—who became notary to the house of Orléans and in that role oversaw Louis Philippe's donation of his personal property in 1830 before his accession. Antoine never saw his child; on 13 fructidor year IV (30 August 1796), the French Directory decided to exile him to Philadelphia, where the French Republic's chargé-d'affaires in the United States of America granted him an annual pension of 15,000 francs. He set out on 5 November 1796, accompanied by his brother Louis Charles, comte de Beaujolais, and in February 1797 met Louis-Philippe in Philadelphia. For two years they travelled around New England, in the Great Lakes and Mississippi area.\nReturning to Europe in 1800, the royal House of Bourbon was still in exile from France, so the brothers set up in England at Twickenham (Highshot House, Crown Road, building demolished in 1927). Later that year Antoine Philippe resolved to seek the hand in marriage of Lady Charlotte Adelaide Constantia Rawdon (d. 1834), daughter of the 1st Earl of Moira by his third wife, Elizabeth Hastings, 16th Baroness Botreaux (daughter of the 9th Earl of Huntingdon by his wife, Lady Selena Shirley, founder of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion). Despite her noble lineage, authorisation for the marriage was withheld by Louis, Count of Provence (the future King Louis XVIII), and the couple never wed.\n\nIn 1807 Antoine Philippe's pulmonary tuberculosis worsened. His elder brother wanted to take him to Devon to benefit from the fresh air but, twelve miles out of Twickenham, they had to stop at an inn at Salthill (near Windsor). Having a respiratory crisis, Antoine Philippe refused the ether Louis-Philippe wanted to administer and, murmuring to him \"Give me your hand, I thought I was dying\" (\"Donne-moi ta main, j'ai cru que je mourais\"), expired.\n\nLouis Philippe had a funeral service held at the Catholic chapel on King Street in London, which \"Monsieur\" (the future King Charles X) attended and, thanks to Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, obtained permission to bury his brother in Westminster Abbey.\n\n"}

She has also appeared in other theatre and television roles and has lent her voice to animated television and films.\n\nGrande's music career began in 2011 with the soundtrack \"\". Since then, Grande has earned three number-one albums on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with \"Yours Truly\" (2013), \"My Everything\" (2014), and \"Sweetener\" (2018). She has also attained a number-two album with \"Dangerous Woman\" (2016). Her upcoming fifth studio album \"Thank U, Next\" is expected to be released in 2018. Furthermore, Grande has earned six top-five singles on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, including \"Problem\", \"Break Free\", \"Bang Bang\", \"Side to Side\", \"No Tears Left to Cry\", and the chart-topping \"Thank U, Next\".

She has previously embarked on The Honeymoon Tour (2015) and Dangerous Woman Tour (2017).\n\nCritics have compared Grande's wide vocal range to that of Mariah Carey. Her accolades include three American Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards and four Grammy Award nominations. All three of her albums have been certified platinum by the RIAA. She has supported a range of charities and has a large following on social media. In 2016, \"Time\" named Grande one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list. In 2018, \"Billboard\" named her Woman of the Year.\n\nAriana Grande-Butera was born in Boca Raton, Florida. She is the daughter of Joan Grande, the Brooklyn-born CEO of Hose-McCann Communications, a marine communications equipment company, and Edward Butera, a graphic design firm owner in Boca Raton. Grande is of Italian descent, and she refers to herself as an Italian American \"half Sicilian and half Abruzzese\". Her name was inspired by Princess Oriana from \"\". She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande, an entertainer and producer, and she has a close relationship with her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Grande. Grande's family moved from New York to Florida when her mother was pregnant with her, and her parents separated when she was around 8 or 9 years old.\n\nAs a child, Grande performed with the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theater, playing her first role as the title character in \"Annie\". She also performed in the musicals \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\". At the age of 8, she performed at a karaoke lounge on a cruise ship and with various orchestras such as South Florida's Philharmonic, Florida Sunshine Pops and Symphonic Orchestras, and she made her first national television appearance singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" for the Florida Panthers. She attended Pine Crest School and North Broward Preparatory School.\n\nBy age 13, she became serious about pursuing a music career, though she still concentrated on theater. When she first arrived in Los Angeles to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&B album: \"I was like, 'I want to make an R&B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B album?!'\" In 2008, Grande was cast in the supporting role of cheerleader Charlotte in the musical \"13\" on Broadway, for which she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award. When she joined the musical, Grande left North Broward Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled; the school sent materials to her so she could study with tutors. She also sang various times at the New York City jazz club Birdland.\n\nGrande was cast in the Nickelodeon television show \"Victorious\" along with \"13\" co-star Elizabeth Gillies in 2009. In this sitcom, set in a performing arts high school, Grande played the \"adorably dimwitted\" Cat Valentine. She had to dye her hair red every other week for the role because the executive producer, Dan Schneider, did not want all the cast members to be brunettes, and the red hair was also a feature that the network felt would fit the personality of Cat. The show premiered in March 2010 to the second largest audience for a live-action series in Nickelodeon history with 5.7 million viewers. The role helped propel Grande to teen idol status, but she was more interested in a music career, stating that acting is \"fun, but music has always been first and foremost with me.\" Her character was compared to \"Brittany Murphy's performance as the hapless Tai in \"Clueless\"\" (1995) and described as being \"very impressionable and easily swayed\" but \"generally sweet\". The second season premiered in April 2011 to 6.2 million viewers, becoming the highest rated episode of \"Victorious\". In 2010, she played the role of Miriam in the musical \"Cuba Libre\", written and produced by songwriter Desmond Child.\n\nAfter the first season of \"Victorious\" wrapped, Grande wanted to focus on her music career and began working on her debut album in August 2010. To strengthen her vocal range, she began working with vocal coach Eric Vetro. She made her first musical appearance on the track \"Give It Up\" on the soundtrack \"\" in August 2011. While filming \"Victorious\", Grande made several recordings of herself singing covers of songs by Adele, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and uploaded them to YouTube. A friend of Monte Lipman, CEO of Republic Records, came across one of Grande's videos. Impressed by her vocals, he sent the links to Lipman, who signed her to a recording contract. She released her first single, \"Put Your Hearts Up\", in December 2011, which was recorded for a teen-oriented pop album that was not issued. She later disowned the track for its bubblegum pop sound, saying that she had no interest in recording music of that genre. The song was later certified gold by the RIAA. Also in 2011, she voiced the fairy Princess Diaspro in 13 episodes of the Nickelodeon version of the Italian animated television series \"Winx Club\", appeared in Greyson Chance's music video for a song called \"Unfriend You\" from his album \"Hold On 'til the Night\", portraying Chance's ex-girlfriend, and voiced the title role in the English dub of the Spanish-language animated film \"Snowflake, the White Gorilla\".\n\nOn a second soundtrack for \"Victorious\", \"Victorious 2.0\", released on June 5, 2012, as an extended play, Grande supplied vocals for a cover of \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\". After three seasons, \"Victorious\" was not renewed. The finale aired in February 2013. The third and final \"Victorious\" soundtrack, \"\", was released on November 6, 2012, featuring Grande duetting with Victoria Justice in the song \"L.A. Boyz\". A music video of the song followed.

Grande played Amanda Benson in \"Swindle\", a 2013 Nickelodeon film adaptation of the children's book of the same name.\n\nMeanwhile, Nickelodeon created \"Sam & Cat\", an \"iCarly\" and \"Victorious\" spin-off starring Jennette McCurdy and Grande. Grande and McCurdy reprised their respective roles as Cat Valentine and Sam Puckett on the buddy sitcom, which paired the characters as roommates who form an after-school babysitting business. The pilot aired on June 8, 2013, and the show was immediately picked up by the network. The following month, Nickelodeon doubled \"Sam & Cat\"s original 20-episode order for season one, making it a 40-episode season. Despite its success in the ratings, the series was canceled after 36 episodes. The final episode aired on July 17, 2014.\n\nGrande recorded her first studio album \"Yours Truly\", originally titled \"Daydreamin\", over a three-year period. It was released on August 30, 2013. She is credited as a songwriter on several tracks of the album. In September 2013, it debuted at Number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart, with 138,000 copies sold in its first week, making Grande the first female artist since Kesha to have her first album debut atop the charts and ranking her the 15th female artist overall. \"Yours Truly\" also debuted in the top 10 in several other countries, including Australia, the UK, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

Grande was later sued by Minder Music for copying the line \"What we gotta do right here is go back, back in time\" from the 1972 song \"Troglodyte (Cave Man)\" by The Jimmy Castor Bunch. Sam Lansky of \"Time\" magazine called the song \"breezy, catchy throwback soul [that] showed off her towering voice.\" Following the release of the album, \"Billboard\" magazine ranked Grande at number four on their list of \"Music's Hottest Minors 2013\", an annual ranking of the most popular musicians under the age of 21. The second single, \"Baby I\", debuted at number 21 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, making it her second Top 40 hit. The song also debuted at number six on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Digital Songs chart, making Grande the only female music artist to debut two songs in the top 10 of the Hot Digital Songs chart during the year 2013. The third single, \"Right There\", featuring Detroit rapper Big Sean, debuted at number 84 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\n\nGrande recorded the duet \"Almost Is Never Enough\" with Nathan Sykes of The Wanted.

It sold 169,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the \"Billboard\" 200, becoming her second consecutive number one album in the US. Its lead single \"Problem\" features Australian rapper Iggy Azalea and premiered at the 2014 Radio Disney Music Awards on April 27.

The music video for \"Bang Bang\" has been viewed more than 1.2 billion times on YouTube. \"My Everything\" spent 88 weeks on the \"Billboard 200\". \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote, \"\"My Everything\" is where the 21-year-old Nickelodeon starlet grows up. It's a confident, intelligent, brazen pop statement, mixing bubblegum diva vocals with EDM break beats\". \"Billboard's\" review noted that \"My Everything\" is not kid-friendly, like Grande's earlier efforts, and \"pulled more sounds into her repertoire while keeping her biggest weapon, a remarkable vocal range, as a steady foundation.\"\nOn September 27, 2014, Grande was the musical performer on the season 40 premiere of NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\", with Chris Pratt as the host.

By April 2015, the album had sold over 600,000 copies in the US and is certified double platinum by the RIAA.\n\nIn early 2015, Grande embarked on The Honeymoon Tour, with shows in North America, Europe, Asia and South America. Following the tour's early success, more dates were added, and the tour concluded in October 2015 after a total of nearly 90 dates. It earned approximately $40 million and sold over 800,000 tickets. Reviews of the tour performances generally praised Grande's vocals and ability to convey emotion in the songs but found the concerts to be over-produced: \"[S]ome judicious editing would've elevated the evening from surprising to satisfying and possibly even shockingly good. As it is, Grande is so busy piling on the spectacle she neglects to highlight the one thing – those deceptively powerful pipes – setting her apart from her contemporaries.\"\n\nGrande was featured on Cashmere Cat's song \"Adore\", which was released in March during her Honeymoon Tour; a review in \"USA Today\" said: \"Grande's towering vocals have never sounded better than on this offbeat R&B track.\" Also in 2015, Grande guest-starred on several episodes of the Fox comedy-horror TV series \"Scream Queens\" as Chanel#2. Grande filmed an episode for the Fox TV reality series \"Knock Knock Live\", but the show was canceled before her episode aired.\n\nGrande began recording songs for her third studio album, originally titled \"Moonlight\", in 2015.

Grande garnered positive reviews for her appearance on the show, including praise for her impressions of various singers, some of which she had done on \"The Tonight Show\".

At the Summertime Ball at London's Wembley Stadium in June, Grande performed three songs from the album as part of her set.

Her agile soprano was strong and unconcealed in every song.\" After Grande's concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England, on May 22, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive in the foyer of the arena, causing 23 fatalities and more than 500 injuries.

Grande said she grew up mainly listening to urban pop and 90s music. Grande's debut album, \"Yours Truly\" was complimented for recreating the R&B \"vibe and feel of the 90s\" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface. The follow-up, \"My Everything\", has been described as an evolution from her first album with a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres. The \"Los Angeles Times\" review of her third album, \"Dangerous Woman\", commented that it is \"impressive how fully she inhabits the emotional environment of each song here, even when one directly contradicts another. ... She's ... deft [at] adapting to different styles\".\n\nGrande has cited Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey as her major vocal influences, saying: \"I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it.\" She describes Gloria Estefan as the person who inspired her to pursue a career in the music industry, after Estefan complimented a performance she saw Grande give on a cruise ship when she was eight years old. She has also cited Fergie, Destiny's Child, Beyoncé, India.Arie and Brandy as influences or inspirations.

With the release of \"Yours Truly\", critics compared Grande with Mariah Carey because of her wide vocal range, sound and musical material. Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of \"Billboard\" wrote that both Carey and Grande have \"the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant.\" Grande responded to the comparisons, \"[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine.\" Steven J. Horowitz of \"Billboard\" wrote in 2014, \"With her sophomore album, the \"Problem\" singer no longer resembles [Carey] – and that's okay.\"\n\nGrande's vocals have gained praise from Kelly Clarkson, Lady Gaga and Chris Martin. Katy Perry said that Grande delivers \"the best female vocal in pop music today. She has literally ... the best voice live.\" Mark Savage commented in \"BBC News\": \"Ariana Grande is one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers. A magnetic performer with unrivalled vocal control\". In \"The New York Times\", Jon Pareles wrote that Grande's voice \"can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced.\" Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown addressed Grande in a 2016 \"Time\" magazine article:\n\nGrande's modest look early in her career was described as \"age appropriate\", compared with other pop stars who grew up in the public eye. Jim Farber of \"New York Daily News\" wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention \"for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings.\" That year, she began to wear short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in performances and on red carpets. After years of dyeing her hair red to play Cat Valentine, Grande wore extensions. Anne T. Donahue of MTV News called Grande \"aesthetically relevant\" and argued that her bold and whimsical fashion choices should receive more critical attention.\n\nAlthough Grande drew criticism for allegedly impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014, she dismissed these reports as \"weird, inaccurate depictions\". After considering the incidents most frequently mentioned in the press and the available evidence, \"PopSugar\" concluded that the incidents were \"just normal star behavior\" and \"not the most ideal situation, but ... not exactly the sign of a diva\". \"Rolling Stone\" wrote: \"Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image.\" In July 2015, Grande was seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying \"I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting\", referring to a tray of doughnuts. She apologized, writing that she is \"extremely proud to be an American\" and that her comments related to American obesity. She later released a video apology for \"behaving poorly\". The incident was parodied by \"The Muppets\" and featured in Miley Cyrus' \"Saturday Night Live\" cover of \"My Way\", about the regrets of the summer of 2015. Grande mocked the incident herself on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2016, saying \"A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught looking at a doughnut they didn't pay for.\"\n\nJournalists and celebrities, such as Taylor Swift, Rita Ora and Selena Gomez, commented favorably on Grande's \"empowering\" 2015 essay posted on Twitter decrying the double standard and misogyny in the focus of the press on female musicians' relationships and sex lives, instead of \"their value as an individual\". Grande noted that she has \"more to talk about\" concerning her music and accomplishments, rather than her romantic relationships. In 2016, \"E!\" writer Kendall Fisher called her \"a feminist hero\" in an essay examining Grande's feminist statements. The same year, Grande was listed among \"Time\"s 100 most influential people in the world. She received praise for her \"grace and strength\" in organizing, hosting and performing at the One Love Manchester benefit concert. Madeline Roth of MTV News wrote that the performance \"bolstered courage among an audience that desperately needed it. ... Returning to the stage was a true act of bravery and resilience\". \"New York Magazine\"s Vulture section ranked the event as the No. 1 concert of 2017. Also in 2017, Mitchell Harrison of \"Billboard\" magazine called Grande a \"gay icon\" for her LGBT-friendly lyrics, performances and \"support for the LGBTQ community\". The same year, Celia Almeida wrote for \"Miami New Times\":\n[O]f all of pop music's biggest stars of the past 20 years, Ariana Grande has made the most convincing and seamless transition from ingénue to independent female artist. ... She saves the celebration of the joys of liberated sexual exploration for her lyrics. ... [S]he has traversed into mainstream-pop adulthood relatively unscathed. ... Grande [wrote in 2016]: \"Expressing sexuality in art is not an invitation for disrespect ... just like wearing a short skirt is not asking for assault.\"\n\nThree out of four of Grande's full-length albums have been certified platinum by the RIAA. Grande has been nominated for four Grammy Awards and has won two MTV Video Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards and three American Music Awards. She has received twelve Billboard Music Award nominations. Grande won a 2014 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award for Favorite TV Actress for her performance on \"Sam & Cat\". Subsequently, she won two more Kids' Choice Awards and one People's Choice Award. In 2014, she received the Breakthrough Artist of the Year award from the Music Business Association for excellence during her debut year. At the Bambi Awards, she received the award for Best Newcomer. She also received two of twelve IHeartRadio Music Awards, including the 2014 Young Influencer Award and the \"Billboard\" Women in Music Award: Rising Star for her accomplishments in 2014. She has won ten Teen Choice Awards.\n\nGrande has a large following on social media. By July 2018, her YouTube channel had accrued more than 25 million subscribers and ranked as the 22nd most subscribed channel, her music videos had been viewed a total of more than eleven billion times, her Instagram account had accumulated more than 130 million followers, ranking her as the 3rd most followed person on Instagram, her Twitter account had more than 55 million followers, making it the 12th most followed Twitter account, and her Facebook page had more than 30 million likes.\n\nAt the age of ten, Grande co-founded the South Florida youth singing group Kids Who Care, which performed for charitable fund-raising events and raised over $500,000 for charities in 2007 alone. In 2009, as a member of the charitable organization Broadway in South Africa, Grande, along with her brother Frankie, performed and taught music and dance to children in Gugulethu, South Africa.\n\nShe was featured with Bridgit Mendler and Kat Graham in \"Seventeen\" magazine in a 2013 public campaign to end online bullying called \"Delete Digital Drama\". After watching the film \"Blackfish\" that year, she urged fans to stop supporting SeaWorld and became a vegan. In September 2014, Grande participated at the charitable Stand Up to Cancer television program, performing her song \"My Everything\" in dedication to her grandfather, who had died from cancer that July. Grande has adopted several rescue dogs as pets and promoted pet adoption at some of her concerts. In 2016, she launched with MAC Cosmetics a line of lip shades called \"Ariana Grande's MAC Viva Glam\", the profits of which benefit people affected by HIV and AIDS.\n\nIn 2015, Grande and Miley Cyrus performed a cover of Crowded House's \"Don't Dream It's Over\" as part of Cyrus' \"Backyard Sessions\" to benefit her Happy Hippie Foundation, which helps homeless and LGBT youths. Later that year, Grande headlined the Dance On the Pier event, part of the LGBT Pride Week in New York City. In 2016, Grande joined Madonna to raise funds for orphaned children in Malawi. In 2016, Grande and Victoria Monét recorded \"Better Days\" in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. To aid the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing, Grande organized the One Love Manchester concert, donated a rerelease of \"One Last Time\" and her live performance of \"Over the Rainbow\" at the concert, and released a live album of the concert. The total amount raised was reportedly $23 million (more than £17 million).\n\nIn September 2017, Grande performed in \"A Concert for Charlottesville\", benefiting the victims of the August 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In March 2018, she participated in March for Our Lives to support gun control legislation.\n\nGrande was raised a Roman Catholic but abandoned Catholicism during the pontificate of Benedict XVI, citing opposition to the church's stance on homosexuality, noting that her half-brother Frankie is gay. She has followed Kabbalah teachings since the age of twelve, along with Frankie, believing \"the basis lies in the idea that if you're kind to others, good things will happen to you.\" A few of her songs, such as \"Break Your Heart Right Back\", are supportive of LGBT rights.\n\nGrande met actor Graham Phillips in the cast of the musical \"13\" in 2008 and dated him until 2011. From December 2012 to August 2013, she dated the comedian Jai Brooks, member of The Janoskians. Brooks accused Grande of betraying him with the singer Nathan Sykes, which she denied. In October 2014, Grande confirmed that she and rapper Big Sean were dating. Sean and Grande made their red carpet debut at the 2015 Grammys. In April 2015, the couple ended their relationship after eight months. She dated backup dancer Ricky Alvarez for around a year beginning in summer 2015. After recording \"The Way\" with Mac Miller in 2012, the two began dating in 2016. The relationship ended by May 2018. Miller revealed that he had fallen in love with Grande for four years before dating her. In May 2018, Grande began dating actor and comedian Pete Davidson. In June 2018, Davidson confirmed that he and Grande were engaged. The two called off their engagement and ended their relationship in October 2018. Davidson confirmed the split on October 20, 2018, a week after it was first reported.\n\nGrande refers to her relationships with Sean, Alvarez, Miller (as well as his death), and Davidson in her single thank u, next; \"Thought I'd end up with Sean / But he wasn't a match / Wrote some songs about Ricky / Now I listen and laugh / Even almost got married / And for Pete, I'm so thankful / Wish I could say 'Thank you' to Malcolm / 'Cause he was an angel.\"\n\nHeadlining\nFestivals (various artists)\n\nOpening act\n\n\n"}

He was the father of the artist Théodore Chassériau.\n\nChassériau came very early in the administration and made the memorable Egypt campaign. Although very young, he administered as Financial Controller, two important provinces of Upper Egypt from 1798 to 1801 under the command of general François-Étienne Damas and then under general Augustin-Daniel Belliard.\n\nFrom 1802 until 1807, he was Treasurer-General and Secretary General of the French colony, Santo Domingo. Appointed Treasurer-General during the expedition to Santo Domingo in 1802, Chassériau held the position of Secretary General in the government of general Jean-Louis Ferrand in the eastern part of Santo Domingo, ceded to France by the Treaty of Basel. During the invasion of the peninsula by the imperial armies, this part of the territory of Santo Domingo, remained more Spanish than French. Taken prisoner, Chassériau managed to escape but maritime war prevented him from returning to France. He visited the West Indies and the mainland of Spanish America. Chassériau was one of the French exiles at the origin of the city of Aigleville and the Vine and Olive Colony.\n\nIn 1813 Simón Bolívar appointed Chassériau Minister of the Interior and the Police in Cartagena, Colombia with his friend Antoine Leleux, who had the portfolio of War.\n\nChassériau as commander took a very active part in the first expedition led by independent against Portobelo (Panama) and Santa Marta. He left Cartagena with 460 men on board 8 schooners and attacked Portobelo (Panama) on 16 January 1814. This expedition was a failure and was rejected by the Spanish royalists controlled by governor Joaquín Rodríguez Valcárcel. The second expedition conducted in 1819 by Scottish general Gregor MacGregor was a success.\n\nIn 1822, Chassériau was the representative of the Masonic loge of the Guajira to the Grand Orient of France. Belonging to a lodge was more a sign of adherence to philosophical or religious principles in a revolutionary goal for freedom and against Spain.\n\nReturned to France in 1822, François-René de Chateaubriand, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent him on a foreign posting from 1823 until 1824. Chateaubriand gave two informal postings to Chassériau: the first mission was to ensure the mediation of France between Spain and the new state and the second mission to facilitate trade relations between Colombia and the French Caribbean colonies, mainly Martinique.\n\nFrom 1826 to 1830, Chassériau was employed by the Department of the Navy as agent in the Danish island of Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. From 1832 to 1833 he was employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, as a Consul of France in St. Thomas. He was Honorary Consul accredited in Puerto Rico from 1835 to 1839, and served from 1840 to 1844 as Consul of France in Puerto Rico, which had a population of 450,000 – of which 12,000 were French.\n\nChassériau died in Puerto Rico on 27 September 1844.\n\nChassériau maintained for many years a friendly relationship with Simón Bolívar who in his correspondence called him \"my French friend\".\n\nIn 1815, Chassériau indirectly saved the life of Bolívar in Kingston. \nOn 10 December 1815 a few hours before the assassination attempt, Chassériau visited Bolivar and gave him money to seek alternative accommodation. Thus, the Liberator left the room where José Antonio Páez had slept for several nights and depended on the guesthouse Rafael Pisce at the corner of Prince and White streets. The same night, Pio the servant of Bolivar and Paez plunged a knife into the neck of Captain Felix Amestoy, thinking it was the Liberator.\n\nIn 1816, Chassériau helped finance Simón Bolívar expedition to los Cayos in the southwestern part of Haiti.\nIn order to collect 3,000 pesos, Chassériau formed a consortium with Jean Pavageau, Michael Scott, George Robertson, S. Campbell and Maxwell Hyslop. On his part, Chassériau lent the sum of 404 pesos to Simón Bolívar. To express his gratitude, Bolivar asked in 1827 the repayment of the loan by increasing interest at 6% per annum from 1 January 1816.\n\nChassériau was the last of 18 children of Jean Chassériau, merchant, ship owner, advisor to the City of La Rochelle. He married in 1806, Marie Madeleine Couret de la Blaquière, daughter of a wealthy French owner in Santo Domingo.\nHe was the father of five children:\n\n\n\nArchives of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs – individual file n° 889 Benoît Chassériau\n"}
{"id": "505437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505437", "title": "Bill Weld", "text": "Bill Weld\n\nWilliam Floyd Weld (born July 31, 1945) is an American attorney, businessman, and politician who was the 68th Governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997. He was the Libertarian Party's nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election, sharing the ticket with Gary Johnson. Johnson and Weld were together the first presidential ticket since 1948 to consist of two state governors.\n\nA libertarian Republican, Weld was the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts from 1981 to 1986, focusing on a series of high-profile public corruption cases, and as the head of the Department of Justice Criminal Division from 1986 to 1988. He resigned from the latter position in 1988, along with the Deputy Attorney General, in protest of an ethics scandal and associated investigations of Attorney General Ed Meese III.\n\nHe was elected Governor of Massachusetts in 1990 and was in office from 1991 to 1997. He was re-elected by the largest margin in Massachusetts' history in 1994 and was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in 1996, losing to incumbent Democrat John Kerry. He resigned as governor in 1997 to focus on his nomination by President Bill Clinton to serve as United States Ambassador to Mexico, but because of opposition by the social conservative Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms, he was denied a hearing before the Foreign Relations committee and withdrew his nomination.\n\nWeld was born in Smithtown, New York. His ancestor Edmund Weld was among the earliest students (Class of 1650) at Harvard College. He would be followed by eighteen more Welds at Harvard, where two buildings are named for the family. General Stephen Minot Weld Jr. fought with distinction in many major battles of the Civil War.\n\nWeld has a sense of humor about his background; when Massachusetts Senate president Billy Bulger publicly teased him about his all-American heritage and wealth, pointing out that his ancestors had come over on the \"Mayflower\", Weld rose on the dais with a correction: \"Actually, they weren't on the \"Mayflower\". They sent the servants over first to get the cottage ready.\"\n\nWeld's father David (1911–1972) was an investment banker; his mother, Mary Nichols Weld (1913–1986), was a descendant of William Floyd, who was a signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. His siblings are Dr. Francis \"Tim\" Weld, David Weld, and Anne (m. Collins). His maternal grandfather was ichthyologist and ornithologist John Treadwell Nichols, and his first cousin is novelist John Nichols.\n\nWeld was educated at Middlesex School. He graduated with an A.B. \"summa cum laude\" in classics from Harvard College in 1966, studied economics at University College, Oxford, and graduated with a J.D. \"cum laude\" from Harvard Law School in 1970.\n\nWeld began his legal career as a counsel with the U.S. House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate impeachment inquiry, where one of his colleagues was Hillary Rodham. In 1978, he ran unsuccessfully for Massachusetts Attorney General, losing to Democratic incumbent Francis X. Bellotti by 1,532,835 votes (78.4%) to 421,417 (21.6%).\n\nHe was appointed as U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, and held the post for five years. In that capacity, Weld expanded an ongoing public corruption investigation of the administration of Boston Mayor Kevin White. More than 20 city employees were indicted, pleaded guilty, or were convicted of a range of charges, including several key political supporters of the Mayor.\n\nFrom 1988–1990, Weld was a senior partner at Hale and Dorr.\n\nIn 1981, Weld was recommended to President Reagan by Rudolph W. Giuliani, then Associate U.S. Attorney General, for appointment as the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. During Weld's tenure, the Attorney General's office prosecuted some of New England's largest banks in cases involving money laundering and other white-collar crimes. In 1985, the \"Boston Globe\" said Weld \"has been by far the most visible figure in the prosecution of financial institutions.\"\n\nWeld gained national recognition in fighting public corruption: he won 109 convictions out of 111 cases.\n\nIn 1983, the \"Boston Globe\" stated: \"The U.S. Attorney's office has not lost a single political corruption case since Weld took over, an achievement believed to be unparalleled in the various federal jurisdictions.\"\n\nIn 1986, President Reagan promoted Weld to head of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department in Washington, where Weld oversaw 700 employees. Weld was responsible for supervising all federal prosecutions, including those investigated by the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, as well as the work of the 93 U.S. Attorneys (who by then included Rudy Giuliani in Manhattan). During this time, Weld worked on some of the Reagan administration's most significant prosecutions and investigations, including the capture of Panama's Manuel Noriega on drug trafficking charges.\n\nIn March 1988, Weld resigned from the Justice Department, together with United States Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and four aides, in protest of improper conduct by U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese. In July 1988, Weld and Burns jointly testified before Congress in favor of a potential prosecution of Meese for his personal financial conduct, following a report by a special prosecutor investigating Meese. Meese resigned from office in July 1988 shortly after Weld's and Burns' testimony.\n\nIn 1990, Weld announced his candidacy for Governor of Massachusetts, to replace the out-going Michael Dukakis. Although Republicans made up under 14% of the Massachusetts electorate and a Republican had not won the gubernatorial election since 1970, Weld's liberal stances on social issues made him a viable candidate for office in the heavily Democratic state. At the state Republican convention, party officials backed Steven Pierce over Weld, and initial polling had Pierce ahead by 25 percentage points. Weld gained enough support to force a primary, and in an upset election, Weld won the Republican nomination over Pierce by a 60–40 margin.\n\nIn the general election, he faced John Silber, the president of Boston University. Polls showed Weld anywhere from a statistical tie to trailing by as many as ten points. Voter dissatisfaction with the state's Democratic majority gave Weld support for his promises to reduce the state deficit, lower the unemployment rate, and cut taxes. On November 6, 1990, he was elected as the 68th Governor of Massachusetts by a 50–47 margin, to become the first Republican governor of Massachusetts since Francis W. Sargent left office in 1975.\n\nThe business community reacted strongly to Weld's leadership. In a 1994 survey of chief executives conducted by the Massachusetts High Technology Council, 83% of those polled rated the state's business climate as good or excellent—up from only 33% at the beginning of his term. Proponents might claim that Weld's leadership changed the minds of 50% of the CEOs surveyed while others would note the national economic trends or other factors might play a part. Weld also reaped the benefits of the 1990s prosperity, as the state's unemployment rate fell by more than 3 percentage points during his first term, from 9.6% in 1991 to 6.4% in 1994. As a result, Weld received grades of A in 1992, B in 1994, and B in 1996 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors. In 1993 he supported adoption of a gun control bill in Massachusetts that included limits on gun purchases under age 21, as well as prohibiting certain types of weapons, which was not ultimately passed. He has since renounced this proposal. During his term, he launched a successful effort to privatize many state's human services, laying off thousands of state employees. After cutting state spending year-over-year for his first two years, the Republican Party lost its ability to sustain a veto in the legislature due to losses in the Massachusetts State Senate, forcing Weld to make greater concessions to Democratic legislators.\n\nIn 1994, Weld won reelection with 71% of the vote in the most one-sided gubernatorial contest in Massachusetts electoral history. Weld carried all but five towns in the whole state, even carrying Boston. Following his landslide victory, Weld briefly considered running for the presidency in 1996.\n\nOn November 30, 1995, Weld announced that he would challenge incumbent Democratic Senator John Kerry in the 1996 election. Weld, who was among the first reasonably well-funded Republican Senate candidates in Massachusetts since Edward Brooke was unseated in 1978, said of the race, \"I've spent some time recently considering where I can do the most good for the people of Massachusetts, and right now the fights that matter most to the people of this state are in another arena, Congress.\"\n\nThe race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year. Noted for how civil their respective campaigns were of one another, Kerry and Weld negotiated a campaign spending cap and agreed to eight separate debates leading up to the election. Though facing a traditional uphill battle in a state where Democrats outnumbered Republicans 3-to-1, and running the same year as the presidential election, Weld was a popular incumbent governor and polled even with Kerry throughout the election.\n\nIn the end, Senator Kerry won re-election with 53 percent to Weld's 45 percent – the last seriously contested Senate race in Massachusetts until the special election for Ted Kennedy's seat in 2010. Notably, President Bill Clinton won Massachusetts in 1996 with 62% of the vote.\n\nIn July 1997, Weld was nominated to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused to hold a hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran–Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: \"It feels like being in a campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up.\" Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't \"very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for.\" There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination \"die\", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton \"does not plan to give in to ideological extortion\" and that \"I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [the nomination] even if it's going to bottom.\" Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that \"I've had a lot of people come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'\"\n\nWeld resigned the governorship on July 29, 1997, to devote his full attention to campaigning for the ambassadorship, even though few thought he would be successful; there was speculation that he was really resigning because he had become tired of serving as governor. A bipartisan majority of Senators signed letters demanding that Helms advance his nomination, but Helms refused. After an intensive six-week battle, Weld conceded defeat and withdrew his nomination on September 15, 1997. He commented sarcastically, \"I asked President Clinton to withdraw my name from the Senate so I can go back to New England, where no one has to approach the government on bended knee to ask it to do its duty.\"\n\nWeld was a partner in the Boston and Manhattan offices of the international law firm McDermott Will & Emery from 1997 to 2001, and head of the New York office from 2000 to 2001. In December 2000, the private equity firm announced that Weld would join the firm, to be renamed Leeds Weld & Co., as a general partner, effective on January 1, 2001. At the private equity firm, Weld later \"reduced his role to a senior advisor while considering a run for New York governor\" in 2005. Weld rejoined McDermott Will & Emery in 2006. Weld was admitted to the bar in New York in 2008. In 2012, Weld moved to the Boston law firm of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky, and Popeo, becoming a partner there and a principal with the firm's government relations affiliate, ML Strategies LLC.\n\nDuring the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush, who was running against Weld's old foe John Kerry, Weld helped Bush to prepare for the debates.\n\nFrom January to October 2005, Weld was chief executive of Decker College in Louisville, Kentucky. His term ended as the college was closing under bankruptcy protection following a disagreement with the U.S. Department of Education about accreditation of its construction-related courses and online instruction. This matter would follow Weld into the 2006 race for Governor of New York, with former U.S. Senator from New York Alfonse D'Amato asserting that Weld was responsible and oversaw \"multimillion dollar looting\". In March 2016, the \"Wall Street Street Journal\" posted an editorial in which the newspaper expanded on a 2012 piece to make the case that the Department of Education's 2005 claim against Decker College was \"factually erroneous\", with revenge against Weld as a motive.\n\nAfter being Governor of Massachusetts, Weld moved to New York in 2000. On April 24, 2005, it was reported that he was in talks with the New York Republicans to run for Governor of New York in 2006, against likely Democratic nominee Eliot Spitzer. Incumbent GOP Governor George Pataki announced on July 27 that he would not seek a fourth term. On August 19, 2005, Weld officially announced his candidacy for Governor of New York, seeking to become the second person after Sam Houston to serve as governor of two different U.S. states. \n\nIn December 2005, Weld received the backing of the Republican county chairs of New York State during a county chairs meeting. On April 29, 2006, Weld received the Libertarian Party's nomination. Weld reportedly offered Faso the chance to join his ticket as a candidate for lieutenant governor, an offer Faso reportedly declined. Faso gained increasing support from party leaders in various counties, including Westchester and Suffolk, both of which had large delegate counts to the state convention.\n\nOn June 1, 2006, the Republican State Convention voted 61% to 39% to endorse Faso over Weld. On June 5, Stephen J. Minarik (the chairman of the state Republican Party, and Weld's most prominent backer), called on Weld to withdraw from the race in the interest of party unity. Weld formally announced his withdrawal from the race the following day and returned to private life. Spitzer would go on to defeat Faso by the largest margin in New York gubernatorial history.\n\nWeld publicly endorsed Mitt Romney for the presidency on January 8, 2007. Weld was a co-chairman for Romney's campaign in New York State. On the same day that Weld endorsed Romney, Gov. and Mrs. Weld also raised $50,000 for Romney's exploratory committee. Weld personally made a donation of $2,100, the maximum allowed per person per election at the time. He later donated another $200 (after the new maximum allowed rose to $2,300).\n\nWeld was also active in campaigning for former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in New Hampshire where both governors have been known to travel together. Weld went on to endorse Barack Obama over John McCain for the presidency of the United States. Weld endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election.\n\nWeld endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for the 2016 Republican primary.\n\nOn May 17, 2016, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's 2012 presidential nominee and the leading candidate for its 2016 nomination, announced that he had selected Weld to be his choice for running mate. The vice-presidential candidate is formally nominated separately from and after the presidential candidate under the Libertarian Party's rules, although as the presidential nominee Johnson was first allowed to speak about his endorsement of Weld. Both candidates won their nominations on a second ballot after narrowly failing to attain an absolute majority on the first ballot. Weld accepted the Libertarian Party's nomination for vice president at the Libertarian National Convention in Orlando, Florida on May 29.\n\nDuring the campaign, Weld took the lead on fundraising operations, as well as appearing on national television and at campaign rallies across the nation. Together, Johnson and Weld were the first presidential ticket to consist of two Governors since the 1948 election. Despite polling higher than any third-party campaign since Ross Perot in 1992, Johnson and Weld were excluded from the debates controlled by the Commission on Presidential Debates and their poll numbers subsequently declined.\n\nNationwide, the Johnson/Weld ticket received 4,488,919 votes (3.28%), breaking the Libertarian Party's record for both absolute vote total (previously 1,275,923 for Johnson in 2012) and percentage (previously 1.06% for Ed Clark and David Koch in 1980).\n\nIn February 2013, Weld publicly supported legal recognition for same-sex marriage in an amicus brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWeld is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nFor a time, Weld wrote thrillers and works of historical fiction.\n\nWeld joined Our America Initiative's 2016 Liberty Tour a number of times, speaking alongside other libertarian leaders and activists such as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition executive director and former Baltimore Police Chief Neill Franklin, Free the People's Matt Kibbe, Republican activists Ed Lopez and Liz Mair, Conscious Capitalism's Alex McCobin, Reason Foundation's David Nott, Foundation for Economic Education's Jeffrey Tucker, the Libertarian Party's Carla Howell, and author and journalist Naomi Wolf; the tour raised \"awareness about third party inclusion in national presidential debates\" and \"spread the message of liberty and libertarian thought.\"\n\nThroughout 2017 and 2018, Weld has appeared at several state Libertarian Party conventions and endorsed various Libertarian candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. He has been speculated to run for the Libertarian nomination in 2020.\n\nWeld's first wife, Susan Roosevelt Weld, formerly a professor at Harvard University specializing in ancient Chinese civilization and law and then General Counsel to the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, is a great granddaughter of Theodore Roosevelt. They married on June 7, 1975, and had five children: David Minot (b. August 26, 1976), a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara; Ethel Derby (b. October 26, 1977), a physician; Mary Blake (b. January 21, 1979), an attorney; Quentin Roosevelt (b. July 9, 1981), an attorney; and Frances Wylie (b.

He first appears in Bob Clark's \"Black Christmas\" (1974) as a deranged murderer who breaks into a sorority house and begins to make obscene phone calls before killing the college students one by one. In the original film, Billy, referred to as The Prowler in the closing credits, was portrayed by Nick Mancuso and was portrayed by Robert Mann in the 2006 remake of the same name. The character was created by screenwriter A. Roy Moore and has since appeared in two films, a mockumentary and a novelization based on the 1974 film.\n\nThe character is the primary antagonist in the \"Black Christmas\" film series. While the character remains ambiguous behind his identity and motivation in the 1974 original film, the 2006 remake explores the childhood of Billy and the motivation for his killings. Clark's intention was to never reveal what Billy looks like, so in the 1974 film, Billy's physical appearance is never fully shown (appearing only as a silhouette and one exposed eye), while in the 2006 film, his appearance is fully revealed.\n\n\"Billy\" made his first appearance in the 1974 original film \"Black Christmas\". In the film Billy, a mentally disturbed man known as \"The Moaner\", regularly calls a local sorority house leaving disturbing and obscene messages. During one such phone call one of the sorority sisters, Barb, provokes him; he responds by threatening to kill them. The caller then goes on a killing spree, murdering many of the sorority house’s inhabitants.\nThe character later appears in a 1976 novelization of the film written by Lee Hayes. With the police not knowing who the murderer is, Billy makes one more call to Agnes.\n\n\"Billy\" later appeared in the 2006 remake of the original film. In the film, the character’s history is expanded, his real name being William “Billy” Edward Lenz (Robert Mann), suffering from severe jaundice due to a liver disease. Although his father loves him, Billy is physically and mentally abused as a child by his mother, Constance Lenz, who blames him for being born. After watching her and her lover (the man who became his stepfather) murder his own father, she locks Billy away in the attic. Attempting to have another child with her lover, he repeatedly falls asleep on the job, frustrating Constance and leading her to rape Billy at age twelve. Although young, and despite the years of abuse, it is implied that Billy becomes aroused when Constance reveals her nude body to him. He then impregnates Constance, leading to the birth of his half-sister and daughter, Agnes. Eight years later, Billy escapes the attic and the two murder their mother and stepfather. Billy then maims, but does not kill, Agnes. Billy is placed in a mental asylum and 15 years later, at age 35, escapes. Billy joins Agnes in attacking the sorority, but both are badly burned by Kelli and Leigh. Billy revives and attacks Kelli, but is pushed over a railing and impaled on a Christmas tree. Billy’s fate is changed in the film’s alternate endings: in one, Billy dies on the operating table, while in another Billy seemingly dies on the operating table only to disappear; the final shot shows Billy peering out of the vents.\n\nBob Clark's intention was to never reveal what Billy looked like. Throughout the course of the original film, Billy's appearances are all silhouette, with only a glimpse of his eye being seen just before Barb is killed and when Jess comes face to face with him. Billy is depicted as a verbal, mentally unhinged, mass murderer who says disturbing things incoherently during the phone calls he makes to the sorority house. He is shown to be able to change his voice frequently. Although his physical appearance is not revealed in the 1974 film, in the reboot Billy is shown to have severe jaundice due to a liver disease.\n\nIn \"Shock Value: How a Few Eccentric Outsiders Gave Us Nightmares, Conquered Hollywood, and Invented Modern Horror,\" Jason Zinoman praised the character saying that, \"What really made \"Black Christmas\" stand out was the killer, who, despite all expectations to the contrary, the audience never actually sees-except for one shot of his eyes peeking out of the crack in the door to the attic. We know he's up there and that he occasionally comes downstairs to butcher people, but we never know when.\" In \"Horror Films of the 1970s\", John Kenneth Muir, who criticized certain aspects of \"Black Christmas\" for being unbelievable, called Billy an effective villain stating, \"the \"Moaner\" is a really creepy villain. His sick, oddball voice is frightening, and the things he says are downright horrid.\" He then said that the phone call scenes work because \"we've all been plagued by crank callers, and some of us have been plagued by crank callers while in our homes.\"\n"}

T. Barnum. He created the modern zoo with animal enclosures without bars that were closer to their natural habitat. The transformation of the zoo architecture initiated by him is known as the Hagenbeck revolution. Hagenbeck founded Germany's most successful privately owned zoo, the Tierpark Hagenbeck, which moved to its present location in Hamburg's Stellingen district in 1907. He was a pioneer in displaying humans next to animals in human zoos.\n\nHagenbeck was born on June 10, 1844, to Claus Gottfried Carl Hagenbeck (1810–1887), a fishmonger who ran a side business buying and selling exotic animals.\n\nWhen Hagenbeck was 14, his father gave him some seals and a polar bear. His collection of animals grew until he needed large buildings to keep them. Hagenbeck left his home in Hamburg to accompany hunters and explorers on trips to jungle regions and snow-clad mountains. He captured animals in nearly every continent in the world. In 1874, he decided to exhibit Samoan and Sami people (then known as \"Laplanders\") as \"purely natural\" populations, with their tents, weapons, sleds, near a group of reindeer.\n\nIn 1875, Hagenbeck began to exhibit his animals in all the large cities of Europe as well as in the United States.\n\nIn 1876, he sent a collaborator to the Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and Nubians. The Nubian exhibit was very successful in Europe, and toured Paris, London, and Berlin. In 1880, his agent Johan Adrian Jacobsen recruited a group of eight Labrador Inuit. The group toured Hamburg, Berlin, Prague, Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Krefeld and Paris. One member of the group, Abraham Ulrikab, kept a diary during his travels in Europe. Unfortunally, all eight Inuit were killed by smallpox.\n\nHagenbeck's exhibit of human beings, considered as \"savages in a natural state,\" was the probable source of inspiration for Albert Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's similar \"human zoo\" exhibition in the Jardin d'acclimatation in Paris. Saint-Hilaire organized in 1877 two \"ethnological exhibitions,\" presenting Nubians and Greenlandic Inuit to the public, thereby doubling the number of visitors of the zoo.\n\nHagenbeck also trained animals for his circuses at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, in 1893, and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 1904. Hagenbeck's circus was one of the most popular attractions. His collection included large animals and reptiles. Many of the animals were trained to do tricks. In 1900 he crossbred a female lion with a Bengal tiger and sold the tigon to the Portuguese zoologist Bisiano Mazinho. Hagenbeck's trained animals also performed at amusement parks in New York City's Coney Island prior to 1914.\n\nHagenbeck planned a permanent exhibit where animals could live in surroundings like their natural homes. Despite the existence of the Zoological Garden of Hamburg, Hagenbeck opened his great zoo, the Tierpark Hagenbeck at Stellingen, near Hamburg in 1907. \n\nIn 1909-1910 he supervised the building of the Giardino Zoologico in Rome. Today his ideas are followed by most large zoos.\n\nIn 1905, Hagenbeck used his outstanding skills as an animal collector to capture a thousand camels for the German Empire for use in Africa. He described his adventures and his methods of capturing and training animals in his book \"Beasts and Men,\" published in 1909.\n\nHagenbeck was one of the first Europeans to describe a creature that came to be known as Mokele-mbembe. In \"Beasts and Men\" Hagenbeck claimed he had received reports of \"a huge monster, half elephant, half dragon\" inhabiting the interior of Rhodesia. Hagenbeck thought the animal was some kind of dinosaur similar to a brontosaurus and unsuccessfully searched for it. His claim made headlines in newspapers around the world and helped launch the legend of Mokele Mbembe.\n\nHagenbeck died on April 14, 1913, in Hamburg from a bite by a snake, probably a boomslang.\n\n\nSpartaco Gippoliti 2004 Carl Hagenbeck's plan for Rome Zoo - and what became of it.

She was affiliated with the National Women's Rights Convention, the New England Women's Club, and the American Social Science Association. Her associates included Elizabeth Peabody and Margaret Fuller, as well as members of the Transcendentalist movement in Boston.\n\nCaroline Healey was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, daughter of Mark Healey, a merchant and investor, and Caroline Foster. She lived there off and on during her life. As a young woman, she received a comprehensive education, encouraged by her father to write novels and essays, and to engage in debates about religion, philosophy and politics. In addition to private tutoring, she attended a private school for girls run by educator Joseph Hale Abbot, until the age of fifteen. \n\nIn the fall of 1842, Healey taught at Lydia S. English's Female Seminary (later known as the Georgetown Female Seminary). Over Christmas 1842, a Unitarian minister from Baltimore named Charles Dall came to fill an open pulpit in Georgetown. Healy initially found Dall unappealing and she was shocked when he proposed to her by letter months later. But after a few weeks of correspondence, she accepted his proposal, reigned her teaching position, and moved to Baltimore.\n\nShe married Charles Dall, a Unitarian minister who worked with the poor in Baltimore, in 1844. The two lived in Toronto during the early 1850s, and returned to Boston in 1855. Her children included William Healey Dall, in whose Washington DC home she lived her later years.\n\nThough she continued to write through the early years of her marriage and child-rearing, after her husband moved to Calcutta, India to perform missionary work, Dall became an active participant in the Boston Women's Rights movement. She was soon an active lecturer and writer on the topic, and organized the New England Women's Rights Convention, along with suffragist Paulina Davis. Also with Davis she founded \"Una\", a journal devoted to woman's rights, and the pioneer publication of its kind. After deciding that she did not like working with groups, Dall turned to writing as her principal means of addressing women's equality. her most prominent works from this time included \"Historical Pictures Retouched: a Volume of Miscellanies\" (1861), which highlighted previously ignored women in history, and a collection of lectures entitled \"The College, the Market, and the Court; or Woman's Relation to Education, Labor, and Law\" (1867) in which she argued that the modern woman was no longer content to be in the domestic sphere and should be allowed to participate in public life. The New York Evening Post called this collection \"the most eloquent and forcible statement of the Woman's Question which has been made.\" Dall was a founder of the Social Science Association (1865).\n\nIn the late 1860s, Dall retired from the Women's Rights movement and turned her writing attention to such diverse topics as Egypt (\"Egypt's Place in History\" 1868) and the Civil War (\"Patty Gray's Journey\", three volumes for children, 1869–70). During this time, she also moved to Washington, D.C., where she became a friend of the current first lady Frances Cleveland. Much of her later work was about the American Renaissance to which she was witness as a young woman. Works from this period include \"Margaret and Her Friends: Ten Conversations with Margaret Fuller\" (1895) and \"Transcendentalism in New England: a Lecture\" (1897), given to the Society of Philosophical Inquiry at the age of 73. During this time, she also gave the occasional sermon in the Unitarian Church, one of the earliest women to do so. In the last years of her life, she suffered greatly from arthritis, though she remained active until her death at the age of 90 on December 17, 1912.\n\n\n\n"}

A Democrat, he also served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior from 1977 to 1981 during the Carter Administration. Andrus lost his first gubernatorial election in 1966, but won four (in 1970, 1974, 1986, & 1990) and his 14 years as governor is the most in state history. Through 2018, he is the most recent Democrat to have held the office.\n\nIn public life, Andrus was noted for his strong conservationist and environmental views and accomplishments, and an Idaho wildlife preserve established in 1993 in Washington County is named the Cecil D. Andrus Wildlife Management Area in his honor. In 2018, the Cecil D. Andrus–White Clouds Wilderness was renamed after him.\n\nBorn in Hood River, Oregon on August 25, 1931, Andrus was the middle of three children of Hal Stephen and Dorothy May (Johnson) Andrus, with older brother Steve and younger sister Margaret. They later lived near Junction City, on a farm without electricity. During World War II, the family moved to Eugene in early 1942, when \"Cece\" was 11, where Hal (1906–2004) and his brother Bud opened a machine shop to refurbish sawmill equipment. Andrus graduated from Eugene High School in 1948 at age 16 and attended Oregon State College in Corvallis, where he majored in engineering in his freshman year.\n\nAt age 17, he got a good summer job with the local utility in 1949, and late in August, he eloped to Reno with Carol Mae May (born December 26, 1932), his high school sweetheart. Andrus had just turned 18, and she was 16 months younger. The Andruses enjoyed a happy, affectionate marriage, and he always referred to her as \"his first wife\" or \"his bride.\" He decided to keep working and not return to college. Following the outbreak of the Korean War, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserves in February 1951, and served as an electronics technician aboard patrol aircraft until 1955. After his discharge from the Navy, Andrus moved to Orofino, where he worked in the timber industry in a variety of jobs at a sawmill his father co-owned. After the sawmill closed,\n\nAndrus switched to the insurance industry in 1963, and moved his family down the Clearwater River to Lewiston in 1966.\n\nIn 1960, at age 28, and concerned over the local Republican state senator's stance against needed education improvements in Idaho schools, particularly in rural areas of the state, Andrus filed as a Democrat to run against him and won, and was re-elected in 1962 and 1964 from Orofino (and Clearwater County).\n\nAndrus first ran for governor in 1966, but was narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary by Charles Herndon, an attorney from Salmon.\n\nSeven weeks before the November election, however, Herndon and two others died in a twin-engine private plane crash in the mountains northwest of Stanley, while en route from Twin Falls to Coeur d'Alene in mid-September. Andrus was appointed the nominee to take Herndon's place on the ballot. He lost the general election to Republican Don Samuelson of Sandpoint by more than 11,000 votes, earning Andrus the unlikely distinction of losing both the primary and general election races for the same office in the same year. Andrus returned to the state senate two years later in 1968, representing Lewiston. Herndon's widow, Lucille, was elected to several local political offices after his death.\n\nUndaunted by his earlier setback, Andrus defeated Samuelson by over 10,000 votes in a gubernatorial election rematch in 1970. This was attributed in large part to Andrus's public opposition to proposals for development of molybdenum mining in central Idaho's White Cloud Mountains, which Samuelson supported.\n\nDuring his first term as governor, Andrus played a key role in winning support by the U.S. Congress for Federal designation of the Sawtooth Wilderness Area in the State of Idaho. Andrus was easily re-elected in 1974 with over 70% of the vote, defeating Republican Lieutenant Governor Jack M. Murphy of Shoshone by a record margin.\n\nIn 1974, \"Time\" magazine named Governor Andrus one of the \"200 Faces for the Future\".\n\nIn January 1977, Andrus left his post as governor to serve as Secretary of the Interior for newly inaugurated President Jimmy Carter, whom he had known since both were freshman governors in 1971. Andrus became the first Idahoan to serve in a Presidential Cabinet. He was succeeded in Idaho by Lieutenant Governor John V. Evans, a Democrat who served nearly a decade, winning re-election in 1978 and in 1982.\n\nAndrus also took a leadership role in securing Congressional passage of the Redwood National Park Expansion Act in 1978. which added to Redwood National Park in California, in a major expansion to preserve remnants of the giant redwood forests there.\n\nIn 1979, when President Carter asked for the resignations of his entire Cabinet during an administration retreat at Camp David, the resignation of Andrus was not accepted. Andrus stayed on as Secretary of the Interior for the remainder of Carter's presidency, and returned to Idaho after Carter's term ended in January 1981.\n\nAndrus wrote in his memoir about such a need for compromise relative to his successful, last-ditch efforts in securing passage of the Alaska Lands Act during the last month of the Carter Administration in December 1980, following Ronald Reagan's election in November: \"The environmental groups were initially hostile. I actually had to listen to the idiotic argument (from the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club's paid Washington lobbyists) that they could get a better Alaska package out of Reagan and Watt.\"\n\n\"Cooler heads quickly prevailed,\" Andrus continues, \"It proved the old adage that there's nothing like a hanging in the morning to focus the mind. Even though we were creating tomorrow's controversies, a 103-million acre [preservation] plan ... was a lot better than nothing.\"\n\nAfter several years in private life following his return to Idaho in 1981, Andrus surprised many by seeking and recapturing the Idaho governorship in 1986, when he defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor David H. Leroy in a close open seat election. The incumbent since succeeding Andrus in 1977, Evans had chosen to run for the U.S. Senate, but lost.\n\nDuring this second stint as governor, Andrus vigorously opposed federal efforts to store nuclear waste in Idaho. He also brokered a path-breaking agreement among land use and conservation interests to control water pollution from nonpoint sources to protect riparian and fish habitat in Idaho's rivers and streams.\n\nIn September 1989, Andrus closed off the Idaho border to nuclear waste shipments from the federal government's Rocky Flats site near Denver. He initially agreed to open a temporary dump near Idaho Falls to store waste until the federal government agreed to open a site near Carlsbad, New Mexico. When the federal government failed to open the Carlsbad site, Andrus refused to accept shipments of plutonium from Rocky Flats. Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins did not challenge Andrus's authority to close the border.\n\nIn 1990, Andrus drew attention when he vetoed a bill, passed by the legislature, which \"would have made abortion illegal except in cases of non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim was under 18, severe fetal deformity or where the pregnancy posed a threat to the mother's life.\" Andrus was easily re-elected later that year against conservative Republican state senator Roger Fairchild of Fruitland, and won every county except Lemhi and Jefferson.\n\nIn his fourth and final term as governor, Andrus was again in the national spotlight due to the Endangered Species Act listing of several Snake River salmon species. These anadromous fish species spawn in their natal streams in Idaho and migrate seaward at a young age. Governor Andrus called attention to the downstream federal dams operated by the Army Corps of Engineers as the major culprit. His successful lawsuit against the federal government led to incremental changes in operations of the dams, and to continuing efforts for major conservationist modifications to the dams that are ongoing today.\n\nOn April 3, 1990, he signed \"House Bill 817\" into law, creating two new types of felony crimes, defined new criminal investigation areas, provided the basis for opening ritual child abuse cases based upon probable cause, and provided a framework for extensive ritual child abuse investigation training throughout Idaho.\n\nDespite remaining personally popular, Andrus did not seek a fifth term in 1994. At his death in 2017, he was the eleventh longest-serving governor in Andrus was succeeded by Phil Batt of Wilder, the first Republican to win a gubernatorial election in Idaho since 1966; he served a single term and did not seek a second in 1998. Andrus's re-election in 1990 was the sixth straight gubernatorial win by Democrats in Idaho (Evans in 1978, 1982), but is the most recent; Republicans have since won seven consecutive, \n\nA wildlife preservation area in Idaho established in 1993, from Cambridge in Washington County, is named the Cecil D. Andrus Wildlife Management Area in his honor.\n\nIn 1995, Andrus founded the Andrus Center for Public Policy at Boise State University, and in 1998, published his memoir, \"Politics Western Style\".\n\nAn elementary school opened in 1997 in west Boise by the West Ada School District was named the Cecil D. Andrus Elementary School in his honor.\n\nAndrus remained active in the Idaho Democratic Party in the early 21st Century, and continued to campaign on behalf of other Democrats. In 2006, Andrus served as campaign treasurer for Idaho Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jerry Brady. In February 2008, Andrus endorsed and campaigned actively on behalf of Illinois Senator Barack Obama in Boise.\n\nAt what was described as the \"second biggest political rally in Idaho history,\" by \"The New York Times\", Andrus introduced Obama and recalled hearing John F. Kennedy speak years earlier: \"I'm older now, some would suggest in the twilight of a mediocre political career,\" Andrus said, \"[but] I, like you, can still be inspired. I can still hope.\"\n\nIn the closing page of his memoir, Andrus quotes the poet Robert Frost: \"We should not have to care so much, you and I.\" \"But we do care\", Andrus continues, \"and we should. We care about the future ... I remain hopeful that I will be able to pass on to my grandchildren all the pleasures of life in an unspoiled West. Perhaps hope should be replaced by a stronger word. It is a matter of obligation.\"\n\nA 2011 book on Andrus and his career in public service described him as \"Idaho's greatest governor.\"\n\nAndrus died on August 24, 2017 in Boise, just one day before his 86th birthday, of complications from lung cancer.\n\n\n"}

At BITS, Sridhar got more interested in finding out the meaning of chants, as he and a few classmates used to gather on weekends at the Saraswati temple in the campus to chant Vishnu Sahasranamam. Listening to them chant, the vice chancellor (Mr. Venkateshwaran) suggested delivering an \"upanyasam\" (discourse)in the campus. He gave his first discourse ('upanyasa') by chance, at BITS Pilani to his co-students at the behest of the vice chancellor, professor and a professor's friend. Sridhar describes how his first experience was a revelation to him on what else went into being an upanyaskar other than public speaking, and started to study more to improve his Sanskrit and Tamil.\n\nSridhar passed out of BITS, Pilani in 2008, by which time he had given a dozen upanyasams. He was under the impression that these upanyasams were a passing fad.

{"id": "1919404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919404", "title": "Harold Cardinal", "text": "Harold Cardinal\n\nHarold Cardinal (January 27, 1945 – June 3, 2005) was a Cree writer, political leader, teacher, negotiator and lawyer.\n\nFrom the start Cardinal steadfastly demanded, on behalf of all First Nation peoples, the right to be \"the red tile in the Canadian mosaic.\"\n\nCardinal was a lifelong student of First Nations law as practiced by Cree and other Aboriginal Elders, and this study has been complemented, but in no way supplanted, by extensive study of law in mainstream educational institutions. He was also a generous mentor and inspiration to a great many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students, professionals and political leaders.\n\nHe died of lung cancer in 2005 at the age of 60.\n\nCardinal's activism began early, as he was elected president of the Canadian Indian Youth Council in 1966. His leadership qualities began to surface in 1968 when, at age 23, he was elected leader of the Indian Association of Alberta for an unprecedented nine terms, during which he was instrumental in the formation of the National Indian Brotherhood (the forerunner of the Assembly of First Nations).\n\nCardinal then served the people of his home community, the Sucker Creek Indian Band, as their Chief.\n\nCardinal served as the Vice Chief of the Assembly of First Nations during the period of the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in the early 1980s.\n\nCardinal was instrumental in the creation, in 1984, of the Prairie Treaty Nations Alliance, representing all First Nations of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, to advance issues of concern to those First Nations with particular emphasis on their treaties with the Crown.\n\nCardinal also participated in Canadian federal politics, in 2000 running unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Liberal Party in the riding of Athabasca. He ran against David Chatters, who had been accused of being anti-Native, in explicit opposition to the apparent revival of popular and political support for policies of Aboriginal assimilation.\n\nCardinal rose to national prominence in the late 1960s. In 1968, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau proclaimed Canada to be a \"just society.\" However, after a promising round of consultations between the government of Canada and aboriginal leaders in which issues of Aboriginal and Treaty rights and the right of self-government were prominently discussed, Aboriginal people were outraged when Trudeau's Minister of Indian Affairs, the Hon. Jean Chrétien (later Prime Minister of Canada) introduced a \"White Paper\" which advocated the elimination of separate legal status for native people in Canada. The white paper amounted to an assimilation program which, if implemented, would have repealed the \"Indian Act\", transferred responsibility for Indian Affairs to the provinces and terminated the rights of Indians under the various treaties they had made with the Crown.\n\nIn 1969, Cardinal swept open what he called, in his first book \"The Unjust Society,\" (cf. Just Society) the \"buckskin curtain\" between aboriginal people and mainstream society with force that was backed up with knowledge, understanding, dignity, anger and pride. The result, as expressed in the title of his second book, published in 1977, was \"The Rebirth of Canada's Indians\" as a political force in Canada.\n\"The Unjust Society\" was Cardinal's personal response to the Trudeau White Paper. It became an immediate Canadian best-seller and was reprinted in 2000 with a new introduction by Cardinal. \"The Unjust Society\" was instrumental in causing the Canadian government to abandon the policy of the White Paper. Cardinal was also the principal author of the Indian Association of Alberta's response to the White Paper, entitled \"Citizen's Plus' or known as 'The Red Paper\". Cardinal's words galvanized the First Nations of Canada into action. The result was a complete about-face by the federal government on the policies of the White Paper and the establishment of joint meetings between First Nations and the federal cabinet in the early 1970.\n\nCardinal's gift for satire was displayed in his early writings, turning Trudeau's promise of a \"just society\" into an \"unjust society\" and a \"white paper\" into \"red paper\", and then equating the brutal slaughter of American Indians by the U.S. Cavalry with bayonet and guns with the cultural genocide which the Canadian government was perpetrating on aboriginal people with paper.\n\nCardinal's lifelong demand for radical changes in policy on aboriginal rights, education, social programs and economic development was a beacon of hope for Canada's First Nations people.\n\nIn 1969, along with Indigenous communities, Elders, and other leaders, Cardinal radically questioned the hegemony of the nation state through his efforts to stop \"The White Paper,\" which culminated in his book \"The Unjust Society\". The book was instrumental in bringing Indigenous people's voices and issues to a centre stage in Canadian life; it also critically engaged the theoretical foundation and practice of Canadian liberalism as found in then Prime Minister Trudeau's conceptualizations of a \"just society\" where all citizens would be considered \"equal\" in the context of the current nation state. Cardinal argued the state's premise of equality and justice was a false one because it failed to take into account the historical conditions under which the nation state was created: conditions that denied Indigenous people's rights as entrenched in the treaties and conditions that, subsequently, oppressed and subjugated them.\n\nCardinal was not only an architect of change on the political level, he was also instrumental in engaging and redefining the manner in which Indigenous and non-Indigenous people related to one another. One of the foundations of his life work was the insistence of the need for mutual recognition, understanding, and respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. While he acknowledged difference, he still fundamentally believed in the power of relationship: \"Two more disparate people, speaking in different tongues, speaking from different worlds, would be hard to find anywhere, and yet their dreams, their visions, their hopes, and their aspirations could not find any greater fusion\"(Cardinal,1977, p.-). Cardinal is also one of the first Indigenous scholars who actively sought \"…a convergence between the knowledge systems of the Cree people and other First Nations and the knowledge systems found in Western educational institutions\" (Cardinal,2007, p. 65). Upon recognition of the power of colonization over both societies, Cardinal foresaw a bridge of understanding between them.\n\nAs embedded in Cardinal's philosophical praxis, his most profound legacy was felt within Indigenous communities. He was one of the first contemporary Indigenous scholars to articulate the notion that Indigenous people could still hold onto traditions while fully engaging in modernity. Cardinal also opened the mindset of the Canadian public to the idea that Indigenous Elders were effectively \"public intellectuals,\" tacitly, raising the profile of Indigenous knowledge. He made further intellectual road maps between Indigenous scholarship and traditional knowledge by articulating the Elders' desires to see Indigenous scholars become familiar with conceptual and theoretical frameworks of Indigenous thought through Indigenous languages in order to maintain cultural strength.\n\nIn addition to his political posts, Cardinal had a full and varied career. In the 1970s, Cardinal was the first Aboriginal person to be appointed to the post of regional director general of Indian Affairs. His tenure was brief and controversial.\n\nIn 1984, Cardinal was appointed by the chiefs of Treaty 8 to negotiate an agreement to \"renovate\" that treaty. The failure of the negotiations after a promising beginning caused Cardinal to undertake a lengthy period of personal reflection, including much study with elders.\n\nCardinal also acted as a negotiator and consultant to many First Nations relating to land and other issues, usually relating to treaty rights.\n\nCardinal made a significant contribution to the work of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, as well as the work of the Assembly of First Nations, particularly on the need for recognition of the sovereignty of First Nations as expressed through their treaties with the Crown. His lifelong position has been that the spirit and intent of the treaties must be the principal instrument governing relations between First Nations and the Crown.\n\nAfter a career in First Nations politics and extensive study with First Nation elders, Cardinal undertook the formal study of law in his 40s. While studying law at the University of Saskatchewan he also served as an assistant professor at that University. He completed his LLM at Harvard University. A Doctorate in Law from the University of British Columbia was awarded to Cardinal days before his death in June, 2005.\n\nOn November 4, 2004, two months before his 60th birthday, Cardinal was admitted to the Bar of Alberta.\n\nIn 1999, Cardinal received an honorary doctor of laws from the University of Alberta in recognition of his unique achievements in leadership, public policy and law.\n\nIn 2001 Cardinal received a National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, lifetime achievement award.\n\n\nCardinal, Harold. \"Nation-Building as Process: Reflections of a Nihiyow (Cree), in DePasquale (ed.), Natives & Settlers, 2007.\n\nCardinal, Harold.

He was a writer for \"The Sarah Silverman Program\", a writer and executive producer for \"Parks and Recreation\", and a recurring guest on \"Comedy Bang! Bang!.\" He is credited with coining the word \"humblebrag\" in 2010.\n\nWittels was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the son of Dr. Ellison Wittels and Maureen (née Davidson) Wittels, and raised in Houston, Texas, in the Jewish faith. He celebrated his bar mitzvah at Temple Emanu-El, across the street from Rice University.\n\nHis elder sister is voice over actress Stephanie Wittels. He described his father as \"the funniest dude alive\".\n\nWittels attended High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston. In 2006, he graduated from Emerson College, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, with a degree in television and video production.\n\nAfter performing stand-up comedy in Los Angeles, Wittels met Sarah Silverman and became a writer on \"The Sarah Silverman Program\" in 2007. He also wrote for the 2007 and 2008 MTV Movie Awards. When \"The Sarah Silverman Program\" ended in 2010, Wittels became a staff writer and executive story editor for \"Parks and Recreation\" during the show's second season, then later co-producer during the third season and executive producer during the fourth. His writing credits included the episodes \"Media Blitz\", \"94 Meetings\" and \"Dave Returns\". He also appeared on the show as Harris, a dim-witted animal control employee. He wrote for \"Secret Girlfriend\" and \"Eastbound and Down\".\n\nIn 2012, Wittels was cast as a co-star in Sarah Silverman's NBC pilot \"Susan 313\" along with June Diane Raphael and Tig Notaro, which was not picked up. In 2012, Wittels was hired as a consulting producer for the TV series \"Eastbound & Down\" during its third season. He consulted throughout the season, as well as co-writing two episodes.\n\nWittels was a frequent guest on the Earwolf podcast \"Comedy Bang! Bang!\" and was known for the recurring segment \"Harris' Foam Corner\" (originally titled \"Harris' Phone Corner\", which debuted on Episode 31 of \"CBB\"), during which he read jokes and observations saved on his phone that were deemed to be not good enough for his act. The jokes were typically lambasted by host Scott Aukerman. Also on the Earwolf network, Wittels hosted the \"Analyze Phish\" podcast, where he attempted to convince friends to enjoy the band Phish. He was also part of the popular series of \"CBB\" episodes entitled \"Farts and Procreation\" along with fellow \"Parks and Recreation\" alumni Adam Scott and Chelsea Peretti. The episodes would usually devolve into nonsensical improv sessions. There were four \"Farts and Pro\" episodes, the final one being recorded very shortly before Harris' death and released days later, posthumously.\n\nWittels was a member of the band Don't Stop or We'll Die, along with comedians Paul Rust and Michael Cassady. He was the band's drummer and provided backing vocals. DSOWD performed a number of times on Scott Aukerman's \"Comedy Bang! Bang!\" podcast and played Los Angeles venues such as Largo and writer/director Rob Schrab's wedding. Notable songs include \"Lisa,\" \"Once in Awhile,\" and \"She Got Titties (In All The Right Places)\". In 2010, Wittels coined the phrase \"humblebrag\" on Twitter. He wrote for Grantland on the subject of notable \"humblebrags\", the act of boasting about one's life and then downplaying it. The popularity of the feed led to a book, \"Humblebrag: The Art of False Modesty\", published in 2012. Humblebrag was designated the \"most useful\" word of 2011 by the American Dialect Society.\n\nIn August 2013, NBC picked up an untitled Wittels sitcom, about a slacker still living with his parents while dealing with his whiz kid younger brother, a multi-millionaire entrepreneur in high school.\n\nWittels was a dedicated fan of the band Phish. His mother Maureen estimated that he saw the band in concert over 300 times in his lifetime, and his contract for \"The Sarah Silverman Program\" was reportedly written to include time-off so he could follow the band on tour. According to the first episode of \"Analyze Phish\", Wittels became a fan of Phish while he was in high school, after he and his friends spontaneously decided to see the band's concert on September 25, 1999 at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion in The Woodlands, Texas. Wittels described the show's impact on him in an interview with \"Relix\", recalling \"I was literally a fan since that night. It was the most amazing concert experience of my life. It wasn't even that great of a show, but even a regular Phish show, especially , is gonna be better than anything else you see.\" Wittels often appeared on \"Parks and Recreation\" as the character Harris, who habitually wore Phish t-shirts.\n\nIn a November 19, 2014 interview on the podcast \"You Made It Weird\", Wittels openly discussed his personal life and history of drug addiction with host Pete Holmes. He said he had done drugs recreationally since he was 12. He said his drug usage got \"out of hand\" because of a breakup with a woman he felt was \"perfect\" for him in every way, except that she and her family were Scientologists, which he described as a \"deal-breaker.\" He said he began to rely on oxycodone to deal with his stress over the relationship, his work on various television pilots, and writing the \"Humblebrag\" book. \"It was easier just to take drugs and do it all. I wrote that entire book on so much drugs,\" Wittels said. \"That's a humblebrag.\" He said he had gone to rehab for a second time after becoming addicted to heroin, and had just gotten out a month earlier; \"Sobriety is still fresh. I haven't figured it all out.\"\n\nWittels addressed his struggles with addiction on \"Analyze Phish\", citing his second stay in rehab as one of the reasons for the delays in releasing the episode where cohost Scott Aukerman went to Phish's 2013 live show at the Hollywood Bowl. During the episode, which was released nearly a year after the show, Wittels touched on the impact his addiction had on his personal and professional life, as well as the use of recreational drugs as part of his Phish fandom.\n\nOn February 19, 2015, multiple news outlets reported that Wittels was found dead of a possible drug overdose in his Los Angeles home. The Los Angeles Police Department said Wittels' assistant found his body around noon on a couch with no signs of trauma and unspecified drug paraphernalia in his house. On February 18, during his stand-up set at The Meltdown, he had talked about living sober and said he was in \"a good place\". A toxicology report was expected to take six to eight weeks.\n\nOn July 28, 2015, the official cause of death was confirmed to be a heroin overdose.\n\nFollowing news of his death, Wittels' friends and colleagues, including Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler, Dan Harmon, Sarah Silverman, Doug Benson, and Scott Aukerman paid tribute to him. Ansari wrote on his blog that the two had been planning to move to New York City together in March, and he shared his favorite memory of Wittels during an appearance on \"Conan\".\n\nThe final episode of \"Parks and Recreation\", \"One Last Ride\", aired a final frame with the message \"We love you, Harris.\"\n\nSimilarly, a frame, \"Dedicated to the Memory of Harris Wittels\", appears before the closing credits on the \"\" comedy special that was released March 6, 2015 on Netflix. In the first season finale of Ansari and Alan Yang's show \"Master of None\", on which Wittels was a writer, an intertitle states \"This series is dedicated to the memory of our dear friend. Harris Wittels 1984-2015\".\n\nHarris' sister, Stephanie Wittels Wachs, used funds her brother left her in his will to set up a multi-discipline performance and communal space for creative people in Houston. Called the Rec Room, the 82-seat theater and adjoining bar opened in June 2016 near Minute Maid Park. On April 20, 2017, the first 420-themed \"Harris Phest\" was held, with comedy, \"Parks and Rec\" sketches and a Phish cover band to mark what would have been his 33rd birthday. The Harris Phest benefits the Harris Wittels Scholarship Fund, which provides grants to students at his alma mater, Houston's High School for the Performing and Visual Arts.\n\n"}

He is supposed to have been the grandfather (by Eliakim Carmoly, \"Revue Orientale,\" ii. 98, the father) of Solomon ibn Verga, author of the \"Shebeṭ Yehudah,\" and it is this work which furnishes some details of Ibn Verga's life.\n\nHe was held in high esteem by the governor of Andalusia. Once the Jews of Xerez de la Frontera, a small town near Seville, were accused of transferring the body of a converted Jew to their cemetery; they applied to Ibn Verga for help, who, when admitted to the presence of the governor, proved by means of a cabalistic writing that the real criminals were the priests (\"Shebeṭ Yehudah,\" § 38). He was very active in maintaining an understanding between the \"Marranos\" and the Jews; the Inquisition, on its introduction into Spain, desired him to betray the former. He succeeded, however, in escaping to Lisbon, where possibly he lived several years, until he was taken by the Inquisition; he died under torture (ib. § 62). Ibn Verga wrote a history of the persecutions of the Jews, largely taken from Profiat Duran's \"Zikron ha-Shemadot\" (comp. the synopsis in Grätz, \"Gesch.\" viii., note 1); his work, in turn, was the basis of the \"Shebeṭ Yehudah\" (see preface to the latter).\n\nThe Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris (MS. No. 1005, Hebr.), contains a series of scientific treatises written by a certain Judah ibn Verga, who is generally identified with the Judah ibn Verga of the \"Shebeṭ Yehudah.\" These treatises are:\n\nThere is, however, some reason for the statement that this identification is doubtful (comp. \"Shebeṭ Yehudah,\" § 62). Another Judah ibn Verga lived in the 16th century and corresponded with Joseph Caro (\"Abḳat Rokel,\" Nos. 99, 100).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "84278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84278", "title": "Laius", "text": "Laius\n\nIn Greek mythology, King Laius (pronounced ), or Laios () of Thebes was a divine hero and key personage in the Theban founding myth. Son of Labdacus, he was raised by the regent Lycus after the death of his father.\n\nWhile Laius was still young, Amphion and Zethus usurped the throne of Thebes. Some Thebans, wishing to see the line of Cadmus continue, smuggled Laius out of the city before their attack, in which they killed Lycus and took the throne. Laius was welcomed by Pelops, king of Pisa in the Peloponnesus. According to some sources, Laius abducted and raped the king's son, Chrysippus, and carried him off to Thebes while teaching him how to drive a chariot, or as Hyginus records it, during the Nemean games. This abduction is thought to be the subject of one of the lost tragedies of Euripides. With both Amphion and Zethus having died in his absence, Laius became king of Thebes upon his return.\n\nAfter the rape of Chrysippus, Laius married Jocasta or Epicasta, the daughter of Menoeceus, a descendant of the Spartoi. Laius received an oracle from Delphi which told him that he must not have a child, or the child would kill him and marry his wife; in another version, recorded by Aeschylus, Laius is warned that he can only save the city if he dies childless. One night, however, Laius was drunk and fathered Oedipus with her. On Laius' orders, the baby, Oedipus, was exposed on Mount Cithaeron with his feet bound (or perhaps staked to the ground), but he was taken by a shepherd, who did not have the resources to look after him, so he was given to King Polybus and Queen Merope (or Periboea) of Corinth, who raised him to adulthood.\n\nWhen Oedipus desired to know more about his parentage, he consulted the Delphic Oracle, only to be told that he must not go to his home or he would kill his father and marry his mother. Thinking that he was from Corinth, he set out toward Thebes to avoid this fate. At the road called 'Cleft Way,' he met Laius, who was going to Delphi to consult the oracle because he had received omens indicating that his son might return to kill him. Oedipus refused to defer to the king, although Laius' attendants ordered him to. Being angered, Laius either rolled a chariot wheel over his foot or hit him with his whip, and Oedipus killed Laius and all but one of his attendants, who claims it was a gang of men. Laius was buried where he died by Damasistratus, the king of Plataea. Later, Thebes is cursed with a disease because his murderer has not been punished.\n\nMany of Laius' descendants met with ill fortune, but whether this was because he violated the laws of hospitality and marriage by carrying off his host's son and raping him, or because he ignored the Oracle's warning not to have children, or some combination of these, is not clear. Another theory is that the entire line of Cadmus was cursed, either by Ares when Cadmus killed his serpent, or else by Hephaestus who resented the fact that Cadmus married Harmonia, the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite, Hephaestus' straying wife. Certainly, many of Cadmus's descendants had tragic ends.\n\n\n"}

Clark shrugged off the press attention, saying she was just cracking a \"crap joke\".\n\nClark gave his first live stand-up show, \"The All-Star Charity Show\", at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2003. It was described by \"The Scotsman\" critic, Kate Copstick, as a \"powerful comedy voice\" and \"stunningly hard-hitting\". and was a Critics' Choice in \"The Times\". Clark's next show, \"The Jim Davidson Guide to Equality\", was based upon comparisons between Jim Davidson's stand-up and Tony Blair's manifesto speeches. A teenage experience of appearing on \"Jim'll Fix It\" with Jimmy Savile provided the basis for \"Jim Fixed It for Me\", performed at the 2006 Edinburgh Festival.

She is left nameless in Chrétien's unfinished romance, but Wolfram von Eschenbach, who reworked the tale for the German epic \"Parzival\", calls her Orgeluse (taken from \"Orgueilleuse\", the French word for \"haughty\").\n\nIn Chrétien's work, Gawain meets the Haughty Maiden while travelling; she treats him with contempt and scorn. Despite her humiliating treatment, Gawain acts with unfailing courtesy towards her, accepting her insults with grace.\n\nFollowing her instructions to search for a nearby castle by a ford, Gawain encounters a knight who tells him that he is either very brave or foolish, for everyone who has tried to cross the perilous ford between them had drowned. Gawain realises the damsel had tried to do away with him. The knight offers to lead Gawain to a bridge, but the hero chooses to jump the ford on his horse Gringolet. He fails once, but succeeds the second time, and when he returns to the Haughty Maiden, she finally gives in and asks for forgiveness for treating him so poorly. She explains that her attitude was the result of tragic circumstances; the knight Guiromelant tried to win her love by killing her first suitor in single combat. Gawain sets off to avenge the fallen knight, but matters are complicated when Guiromelant reveals his love for Gawain's sister. The poem breaks off before the matter is resolved, though a later author tied up some of the loose threads in the First Continuation of \"Perceval\".\n\nWolfram expands the story and brings it to completion. He explains that the Wounded King Anfortas had been injured fighting for Orgeluse, and was now waiting for Parzival (Percival) to heal him. Gawain and Orgeluse express their love for each other, and eventually peace is made between the lady and Guiromelant. Orgeluse marries Gawain while Guiromelant marries the champion's sister.\n"}

He is the son of former U.S. Representative Ron Paul of Texas.\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Paul attended Baylor University and is a graduate of the Duke University School of Medicine. Paul began practicing ophthalmology in 1993 in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and established his own clinic in December 2007. In 2010, Paul entered politics by running for a seat in the United States Senate. A Republican, Paul has described himself as a Constitutional conservative and a supporter of the Tea Party movement. He has advocated for a balanced budget amendment, term limits, and privacy reform.\n\nPaul was a candidate for the Republican nomination at the 2016 US presidential election. He suspended his campaign in February 2016, after finishing in fifth place out of 12 Republican candidates at the Iowa caucuses.\nRandal Howard Paul was born on January 7, 1963, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Carol (née Wells) and Ron Paul, who is also a politician and physician. The elder Paul was a U.S. Representative from Texas and ran for President of the United States three times. The middle child of five, his siblings are Ronald \"Ronnie\" Paul Jr., Lori Paul Pyeatt, Robert Paul, and Joy Paul-LeBlanc.\n\nPaul was baptized in the Episcopal Church and identified as a practicing Christian as a teenager.\n\nDespite his father's libertarian views and strong support for individual rights, the novelist Ayn Rand was not the inspiration for his first name. Growing up, he went by \"Randy\", but his wife shortened it to \"Rand.\"\n\nThe Paul family moved to Lake Jackson, Texas, in 1968, where he was raised and where his father began a medical practice and for an extent of time was the only obstetrician in Brazoria County.\n\nWhen Rand was 13, his father was elected to the United States House of Representatives. That same year, Paul attended the 1976 Republican National Convention, where his father headed Ronald Reagan's Texas delegation. The younger Paul often spent summer vacations interning in his father's congressional office. In his teenage years, Paul studied the Austrian economists that his father respected, as well as the writings of Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand. Paul went to Brazoswood High School and was on the swimming team and played defensive back on the football team.\n\nPaul attended Baylor University from fall 1981 to summer 1984 and was enrolled in the honors program. During the time he spent at Baylor, he was involved in the swim team and the Young Conservatives of Texas and was a member of a secret organization known as The NoZe Brotherhood. He regularly contributed to \"The Baylor Lariat\" student newspaper. Paul dropped out of Baylor without completing his baccalaureate degree, when he was accepted into his father's alma mater, the Duke University School of Medicine, which, at the time, did not require an undergraduate degree for admission to its graduate school. He earned an M.D. degree in 1988 and completed his residency in 1993.\n\nAfter completing his residency in ophthalmology, Paul moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky. He has held a state-issued medical license since moving there in 1993. He received his first job from John Downing of Downing McPeak Vision Centers, which brought him to Bowling Green after completing his residency. Paul worked for Downing for about five years before parting ways. Afterwards, he went to work at the Graves Gilbert Clinic, a private medical group in Bowling Green, for 10 years before creating his own practice in a converted one-story house across the street from Downing's office. After his election to the U.S. Senate, he merged his practice with Downing's medical practice. Paul has faced two malpractice lawsuits between 1993 and 2010; he was cleared in one case while the other was settled for $50,000. His medical work has been praised by Downing and he has medical privileges at two Bowling Green hospitals.\n\nPaul specializes in cataract and glaucoma surgeries, LASIK procedures, and corneal transplants. As a member of the Bowling Green Noon Lions Club, Paul founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic in 2009 to help provide eye surgery and exams for those who cannot afford to pay. Paul won the Melvin Jones Fellow Award for Dedicated Humanitarian Services from the Lions Club International Foundation for his work establishing the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic.\n\nIn 1995, Paul passed the American Board of Ophthalmology (ABO) boards on his first attempt and earned board-certification under the ABO for 10 years. Prior to this, in 1992, the ABO had changed its certification program, which had previously awarded lifetime certifications, instead requiring doctors to recertify every 10 years. Those who had already been given lifetime certification were allowed to keep it (according to the ABO, they would not legally have been able to rescind these certifications). Shortly after this change, Paul began a campaign to protest it. This effort culminated in 1997 with him creating, \"along with 200 other young ophthalmologists\", the National Board of Ophthalmology (NBO) to offer an alternative certification system, at a cost substantially lower than that of the ABO. Its certification exam, an open book take-home test, was described by one taker as \"probably harder\" and \"more clinically relevant\" than the ABO's exam.\n\nNamed board members were Paul, his wife, and his father-in-law.\nThe NBO was, itself, never accepted as an accrediting entity by organizations such as the American Board of Medical Specialties, and its certification was considered invalid by many hospitals and insurance companies. Paul let his own ABO certification lapse in 2005, which did not affect his practice in Kentucky; the state does not require board certification. By Paul's estimate, about 50 or 60 doctors were certified by the NBO. The NBO was incorporated in 1999, but Paul allowed it to be dissolved in 2000 when he did not file the required paperwork with the Kentucky Secretary of State's office. He later recreated the board in 2005, but it was again dissolved in 2011.\n\nPaul was head of the local chapter of the Young Conservatives of Texas during his time at Baylor University. In 1984, Paul took a semester off to aid his father's primary challenge to Republican Senator Phil Gramm.\n\nWhile attending Duke University School of Medicine, Paul volunteered for his father's 1988 Libertarian presidential campaign.\n\nIn response to President Bush's breaking his election promise to not , Paul founded the North Carolina Taxpayers Union in 1991. In 1994, Paul founded the anti-tax organization Kentucky Taxpayers United (KTU), and was chair of the organization from its inception. He has often cited his involvement with KTU as the foundation of his involvement with state politics. The group examined Kentucky legislators' records on taxation and spending and encouraging politicians to publicly pledge to vote uniformly against tax increases.\n\nPaul managed his father's successful 1996 Congressional campaign, in which the elder Paul returned to the House after a twelve-year absence. The elder Paul defeated incumbent Democrat-turned-Republican Greg Laughlin in the Republican primary, despite Laughlin's support from the NRCC and Republican leaders such as Newt Gingrich and George W. Bush.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" reported in 2010 that, although Paul had told a Kentucky television audience as recently as September 2009 that KTU published ratings each year on state legislators' tax positions and that \"we've done that for about 15 years\", the group had stopped issuing its ratings and report cards after 2002 and had been legally dissolved by the state in 2000 after failing to file registration documents.\n\nPaul spoke on his father's behalf when his father was campaigning for office, including throughout the elder Paul's run in the 2008 presidential election, during which Rand campaigned door-to-door in New Hampshire and spoke in Boston at a fundraising rally for his father on the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party.\n\nIn February 2014, Paul joined the Tea Party-affiliated conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks in filing a class-action lawsuit charging that the federal government's bulk collection of Americans' phone records metadata is a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Commenting on the lawsuit at a press conference, Paul said, \"I'm not against the NSA, I'm not against spying, I'm not against looking at phone records... I just want you to go to a judge, have an individual's name and [get] a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says.\" He also said there was no evidence the surveillance of phone metadata had stopped terrorism. Critics, including Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz and Steven Aftergood, the director of the American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, called the lawsuit a political \"stunt\". Paul's political campaign organization said that the names of members of the public who went to Paul's websites and signed on as potential class-action participants would be available in the organization's database for future campaign use.\n\nOn the announcement of the filing of the lawsuit, Mattie Fein, the spokeswoman for and former wife of attorney Bruce Fein, complained that Fein's intellectual contribution to the lawsuit had been stolen and that he had not been properly paid for his work. Paul's representatives denied the charge, and Fein issued a statement saying that Mattie Fein had not been authorized to speak for him on the matter and that he had in fact been paid for his work on the lawsuit.\n\nPaul is co-author of a book entitled \"The Tea Party Goes to Washington\" (2011) and also the author of \"Government Bullies: How Everyday Americans Are Being Harassed, Abused, and Imprisoned by the Feds\" (2012). Paul was included in \"Time\" magazine's world's 100 most influential people, for 2013 and 2014. He is also a contributor to \"Time\" magazine.\n\nAt the beginning of 2009, there was movement by political supporters of his father to draft Paul in a bid to replace beleaguered Republican Kentucky senator Jim Bunning. Paul's potential candidacy was discussed in the \"Los Angeles Times\" and locally in the Kentucky press. Paul's father said, \"Should Senator Bunning decide not to run, I think Rand would make a great U.S. Senator.\" On April 15, 2009, Paul gave his first political speech as a potential candidate at a Tea Party rally held in his town of Bowling Green, Kentucky, where more than 700 people had gathered in support of the Tea Party movement.\n\nOn May 1, 2009, Paul said that if Bunning, whose fundraising in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election, declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the Republican Party primary to succeed him, and formed an exploratory committee soon after, while still promising to stay out of the race if Bunning ultimately decided to run for reelection. Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's \"The Rachel Maddow Show\", though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.\n\nOn July 28, 2009, Bunning announced that he would not run for reelection in the face of insufficient fundraising. The announcement left only Paul and Secretary of State Trey Grayson as the remaining candidates for the Republican nomination, with Paul announcing on August 5, 2009, that he would officially run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican. The announcement was made through a series of national TV events, radio, and other programs, as well as newspapers in Kentucky.\n\nOn August 20, 2009, Paul's supporters planned a moneybomb to kick off his campaign. The official campaign took in $433,509 in 24 hours. His website reported that this set a new record in Kentucky's political fundraising history in a 24-hour period. A second \"moneybomb\" was held on September 23, 2009, to counter a D.C. fundraiser being held for primary opponent Trey Grayson, by 23 Republican United States Senators. The theme was a UFC \"fight\" between \"We the People\" and the \"D.C. Insiders\". Later in the campaign, Paul claimed his pledge to not take money from lobbyists and Senators who had voted for the bailout was only a \"primary pledge\"; he subsequently held a fundraiser in Washington, D.C., with the same Senators who had been the target of the September 23, 2009, \"moneybomb\". Paul ended up raising some $3 million during the primary period. Paul's fundraising was aided by his father's network of supporters.\n\nAlthough Grayson was considered the frontrunner in July 2009, Paul found success characterizing Grayson as a \"career politician\" and challenging Grayson's conservatism. Paul ran an ad in February that made an issue out of Grayson's September 2008 admission that he voted for Bill Clinton when he was 20 years old. James Dobson, a Christian evangelical figure, endorsed Grayson on April 26 based on the advice of what Dobson described as \"senior members of the GOP\", but on May 3 the Paul campaign announced that Dobson had changed his endorsement to Paul after Paul and some Paul supporters had lobbied Dobson insisting on Paul's social conservative bona fides.\n\nOn May 18, Paul won the Republican Senatorial primary by a 23% margin, meaning he would face the Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway, in the November 2 general election.\n\nIn the 2010 general election, Paul faced Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway. The campaign attracted $8.5 million in contributions from outside groups, of which $6 million was spent to help Paul and $2.5 million to help Conway. This money influx was in addition to the money spent by the candidates themselves: $6 million by Paul and $4.7 million by Conway.\n\nOn June 28, 2010, Paul supporters held their first post-primary online fundraising drive, this time promoted as a \"money blast\".\n\nPaul's campaign got off to a rough start after his comments on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stirred controversy. Paul stated that he favored 9 out of 10 titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but that had he been a senator during the 1960s, he would have raised some questions on the constitutionality of Title II of the Act. Paul said that he abhors racism, and that he would have marched with Martin Luther King Jr. to repeal Jim Crow laws. He later released a statement declaring that he would have voted for the Act and stated \"unequivocally ... that I will not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964\". Later he generated more controversy by characterizing statements made by Obama Administration officials regarding the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup as sounding \"un-American\".\n\nPaul defeated Conway in the general election with 56% of the vote to 44% for Conway.\n\nPaul was sworn in on January 5, 2011, along with his father, who was simultaneously in the House of Representatives.\n\nPaul was assigned to be on the Energy and Natural Resources, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Small Business committees. Paul also formed the Senate Tea Party Caucus with Jim DeMint and Mike Lee as its inaugural members. His first legislative proposal was to cut $500 billion from federal spending in one year. This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83 percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43 percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would be cut by 30 percent. Under Paul's proposal, defense spending would be reduced by 6.5 percent and international aid would be eliminated. He later proposed a five-year budget plan intended to balance the budget.\n\nIn February, Paul was one of two Republicans to vote against extending three key provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act (roving wiretaps, searches of business records, and conducting surveillance of \"lone wolves\" — individuals not linked to terrorist groups).\n\nOn March 2, Paul was one of nine senators to vote against a stopgap bill that cut $4 billion from the budget and temporarily prevent a government shutdown, saying that it did not cut enough from the budget. One week later, he voted against the Democratic and Republican budget proposals to keep funding the federal government, saying that both bills did not cut enough spending. Both bills failed to pass the Senate. He later voted against stopgap measures on March 17 and April 8, both of which passed the senate.\n\nOn April 14, he was one of 19 senators to vote against a budget that cut $38.5 billion from the budget and fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\nPaul voiced opposition to U.S. intervention in the Libyan Civil War and has criticized President Obama for not gaining congressional consent for Operation Odyssey Dawn. During the debt ceiling crisis, the Senator stated that he would only support raising the debt ceiling if a balanced budget amendment was enacted. Paul was a supporter of the Cut, Cap and Balance Act, which was tabled by Democratic opposition. On August 3, Paul voted against a bill that would raise the debt ceiling.\n\nOn September 7, Paul called for a vote of no confidence in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules for oil and gas pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36 million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program.\n\nIn June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.\n\nFor the 113th Congress, Paul was added to the Foreign Relations committee and retained his spot on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Small Business committees.\n\nOn March 6–7, 2013, Paul engaged in a filibuster to delay voting on the nomination of John O. Brennan as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Paul questioned the Obama administration's use of drones and the stated legal justification for their potential use within the United States. Paul held the floor for 12 hours and 52 minutes. He ceded to several Republican senators and Democratic senator, Ron Wyden, who generally also questioned drone usage. Paul said his purpose was to challenge drone policy in general and specifically as it related to noncombatants on U.S. soil. He requested a pledge from the Administration that noncombatants would not be targeted on U.S. soil. Attorney General Eric Holder responded that the President is not authorized to deploy extrajudicial punishment without due process, against non-combatant citizens. Paul answered that he was \"quite happy\" with the response. The filibuster was ended with a cloture vote of 81 to 16, and Brennan was confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 63 to 34.\nIn March 2013, Paul, with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, threatened another filibuster, this one opposing any legislative proposals to expand federal gun control measures. The filibuster was attempted on April 11, 2013, but was dismissed by cloture, in a 68–31 vote. Also in March 2013, Paul endorsed fellow Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell's 2014 re-election campaign. McConnell had previously hired Paul's 2010 campaign manager, Jesse Benton, as his own campaign manager. Paul's endorsement was seen as a major win for McConnell in avoiding a challenge in the Republican primary.\n\nIn response to Detroit's declaration of bankruptcy, Paul stated he would not allow the government to attempt to bail out Detroit. In a phone interview with Breitbart News on July 19, 2013, Paul said, \"I basically say he is bailing them out over my dead body, because we don't have any money in Washington.\" Paul said he thought a federal bailout would send the wrong message to other cities with financial problems.\n\nIn September, Paul stated that the United States should avoid military intervention in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. In an op-ed, Paul disputed the Obama administration's claims that the threat of military force caused Syria's government to consider turning over its chemical weapons, instead arguing that the opposition to military action in Syria, and the delay that it caused, led to diplomatic progress.\n\nIn October 2013, Paul was the subject of some controversy when it was discovered that he had plagiarized from Wikipedia part of a speech in support of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli. Referencing the movie \"Gattaca\", Paul quoted almost verbatim from the Wikipedia article about the film without citing the source. Evidence soon surfaced that Paul had copied sentences in a number of his other speeches nearly verbatim from other authors without giving credit to the original sources, including in the speech he had given as the Tea Party rebuttal to the president's 2013 State of the Union address. In addition, a three-page-long passage of Paul's book \"Government Bullies\" was taken directly from an article by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. When it became apparent that Paul's op-ed in \"The Washington Times\" on mandatory minimums and related testimony he had given before the Senate Judiciary Committee both contained material that was virtually identical to an article that had been published by another author in \"The Week\" a few days earlier, the \"Washington Times\" said that the newspaper would no longer publish the weekly column Paul had been contributing to the paper. After a week of almost daily news reports of new allegations of plagiarism, Paul said that he was being held to an \"unfair standard\", but would restructure his office in order to prevent mistakes in the future, if that would be what it would take \"to make people leave me the hell alone.\"\n\nIn response to political turmoil in Ukraine in early 2014, Paul initially said that the United States should remain mindful of the fact that although the Cold War is over, Russia remains a military power with long-range nuclear missiles. He said that the United States should try to maintain a \"respectful relationship with Russia\" and avoid taking actions that the Russians might view as a provocation, such as seeking to have Ukraine join NATO or otherwise interfering in Russia's relationship with Ukraine.\n\nTwo weeks later, after the Russian parliament authorized the use of military force in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises along Russia's border with Ukraine, Paul began taking a different tone. He wrote: \"Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community ... Putin must be punished for violating the Budapest Memorandum, and Russia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation.\" He said that the United States and European allies could retaliate against Russia's military aggression without any need for military action. He urged that the United States impose economic sanctions on Russia and resume an effort to build defensive anti-missile installations in Poland and the Czech Republic. He also called for the United States to take steps as a counterweight to Russia's strategic influence on Europe's oil and gas supply, such as lifting restrictions on new exploration and drilling for fossil fuels in the United States along with immediate approval of the controversial Keystone Pipeline, which he said would allow the United States to ship more oil and gas to Europe if Russia attempts to cut off its own supply to Europe.\n\nPaul played a leading role in blocking a treaty with Switzerland that would enable the IRS to conduct tax evasion probes, arguing that the treaty would infringe upon Americans' privacy. Paul received the 2014 Distinguished Service Award from the Center for the National Interest (formally called the Nixon Center) for his public policy work.\n\nIn response to reports that the CIA infiltrated the computers of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Paul called for the firing of CIA Director John O. Brennan. In December 2014, Paul supported the actions to change United States policy towards Cuba and trade with that country taken by the Obama administration.\n\nIn the beginning of 2015, Senator Paul re-introduced the Federal Reserve Transparency Act. Senator Paul also introduced the FAIR Act, or Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act, which would restrict civil forfeiture proceedings. Paul spoke for ten and a half hours on May 20, 2015, in opposition to the reauthorization of Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Sections of the Patriot Act were prevented from being reauthorized on June 1.\n\nAfter the death of Antonin Scalia in February 2016, on February 15, Paul indicated that he would oppose any nomination by President Obama to replace the late Supreme Court Justice.\n\nDuring a press briefing on May 6, 2016, President Obama called on Paul to stop \"blocking the implementation of tax treaties that have been pending for years\", arguing that they assisted law enforcement in off shore investigations into tax evasion. Paul advocated for the abolition of gun-free zones during a speech to the National Rifle Association on May 20, citing repeated tragedies occurring in these locations. On June 6, Paul spoke of introducing legislation to cease Selective Service, three days after the passing of Muhammad Ali, after whom he intended to name the legislation in tribute.\n\nIn March 2017, Paul introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act that would prohibit the use of United States Government funds to provide assistance to Al Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and to countries supporting those organizations. On March 16, Senator John McCain accused Paul of being an agent of Vladimir Putin after Paul objected to adding Montenegro to NATO. Paul responded the following day by saying McCain \"makes a really, really strong case for term limits\", suggesting McCain had become \"a little unhinged\" as a result of his seniority. On April 7, McCain said he did not pay attention to any of Paul's rhetoric and that the latter did not have \"any real influence\" in the United States Senate.\n\nPaul questioned President Trump's April 2017 missile strike to Syria by saying, \"While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked.\" He said that further action should not be taken without congressional authorization.\n\nPaul was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement in May 2017. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Paul has received over $250,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012. In July, Rand Paul joined Reps. Justin Amash (R-MI), Thomas Massie (R-KY), John Duncan Jr. (R-TN) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in opposing a bill that would impose new economic sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. President Trump opposed the bill, pointing out that relations with Russia were already \"at an all-time and dangerous low\". He did, however, sign the bill though likely out of political pressure.\n\nOn September 5, the Trump administration announced the intended recission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In tweets responding to the act, Paul stated the executive order that created DACA was illegal and congressional bipartisanship was needed to solve or fix the program.\n\nPaul confirmed in an October 2017 intetview he would not vote for the Republican budget in the Senate unless billions in spending were removed from the plan: \"If leadership is unwilling to compromise with somebody who is concerned about the debt, then they deserve to lose.\"\n\nIn February 2018, Republican Senators introduced immigration framework akin to that proposed by President Trump and with his support that called for a 25 billion being provided for border security in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million immigrants brought into the US illegally. Paul was one of fourteen Republican Senators to vote against the proposal.\n\nFive ThirtyEight, which tracks Congressional votes, found that Paul has voted with Donald Trump's positions the least out of all Republicans, only voting with him 74% of the time as of August 2018.\n\nPaul introduced a bill on January 25, 2017, that sought to replace the Affordable Care Act which included each person's having a tax credit of $5,000 and not requiring everyone to have coverage, unlike Obamacare.\n\nOn March 2, after marching to the House of Representatives side of Capital Hill, Paul was filmed knocking on a door while demanding to see their copy of the replacing and repealing the Affordable Care Act bill. Paul spoke with President Trump over the phone on March 6, Paul telling him that the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act should be two separate bills. Two days later, Paul said Republicans were united in repealing the Affordable Care Act, but divided in their stances on its replacement. On March 12, Paul accused House Speaker Paul Ryan of being misleading in portraying supporters of the American Health Care Act of 2017 as not being negotiable, and three days later, March 15, furthered that Ryan was \"selling\" President Trump \"a bill of goods\" that he had not explained fully to the president.\n\nAfter the bill was pulled by Republican leaders from a vote, Paul released a statement on March 24 thanking House conservatives for rebelling \"against ObamaCare Lite.\" Later, on April 2, Paul golfed with Trump and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where they discussed a variety of topics, including healthcare.\n\nPaul told reporters on June 15 that he was willing to vote for a partial repeal, but not the implementation of new Republican entitlement programs, which he identified as present in both House and Senate versions of the bill. Paul also told reporters on September 11 that he did not believe the Graham-Cassidy bill would pass. Paul tweeted on September 15 that Graham-Cassidy retained \"90% of Obamacare\" and dubbed it \"more Obamacare Lite\".\n\nOn September 19, Paul asserted the Graham-Cassidy bill as immortalizing the Affordable Care Act and \"a big government boondoggle of a trillion dollars of spending\" that Republicans should abandon in favor of pursuing measures that would allow for health insurance to be purchased across state lines. On September 22, after President Trump tweeted that \"Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as 'the Republican who saved Obamacare'\", Paul responded that he would not be coerced into supporting Graham-Cassidy with bribes or bullying.\n\n\n\nPaul was considered a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States since at least January 2013. He delivered the Tea Party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on February 13, 2013, while Marco Rubio gave the official Republican response. This prompted some pundits to call that date the start of the 2016 Republican primaries. That year, he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C., where he won the 2016 Presidential straw poll. Paul went on to win the straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.\n\nIn a speech at the GOP Freedom Summit in April 2014, Paul insisted that the GOP has to broaden its appeal in order to grow as a party. To do so, he said it cannot be the party of \"fat cats, rich people and Wall Street\" and that the conservative movement has never been about rich people or privilege, \"we are the middle class\", he said. Paul also said that conservatives must present a message of justice and concern for the unemployed and be against government surveillance to attract new people to the movement, including the young, Hispanics, and blacks.\n\nDuring the 2014 election, Paul launched a social media campaign titled \"Hillary's Losers\" which was meant to highlight many of the Democratic candidates that lost their bids for the U.S. Senate despite endorsements from Hillary Clinton. Clinton was also a candidate for President and eventually won the Democratic Party's nomination, going on to lose to Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nPaul began to assemble his campaign team, setting up campaign offices and hiring his campaign manager in the beginning of 2015, fueling speculation that he was preparing to enter the Presidential race. Paul officially announced his presidential candidacy on April 7, 2015. Within a day of his announcement, Paul raised $1 million.\n\nIn April 2011, Paul filed to run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running for re-election. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed a bill that would allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up.\n\nPaul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.\n\nPaul announced the suspension of his presidential campaign on February 3, 2016, shortly after the Iowa caucus, where he finished 5th of the 12 Republicans in the race.\n\nA supporter of the Tea Party movement, Paul has described himself as a \"constitutional conservative\". He is generally described as a libertarian, a term he both embraced and rejected during his first Senate campaign. He supports term limits, a balanced budget amendment, and the Read the Bills Act, in addition to the widespread reduction of federal spending and taxation. He favors a flat tax rate of 14.5% for individuals and business, while eliminating the FICA payroll taxes, as well as taxes on inheritance, gifts, capital gains, dividends, and interest. Paul has frequently appeared on \"Infowars\" with radio show host and right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nOn social issues, Paul describes himself as \"100% pro life\", believing that legal personhood begins at fertilization. In 2009, his position was to ban abortion under all circumstances. Since 2010, he has said he would allow for a doctor's discretion in life-threatening cases such as ectopic pregnancies. \nPaul has said that same-sex marriage \"offends [himself] and a lot of people\" on a personal level, and said there is a \"crisis that allows people to think there would be some other sorts of marriage.\" Paul holds the view that the decision to ban same-sex marriage should be in the hands of states.\n\nPaul is uncertain regarding the causes behind global warming; he believes the scientific opinion on climate change is \"not conclusive.\" Paul said pollution emissions are subject to \"onerous regulation.\" In 2018, Paul called for an investigation of a National Science Foundation grant that went towards educating meteorologists about the science of climate change. Paul said the grant was \"not science\" but \"propagandizing\".\n\nPaul has criticized mandatory minimums for drug crimes, which he believes have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. Paul does not believe in legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law. In 2017, Paul voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General despite Sessions' opposition to criminal justice reform and drug decriminalization because Democrats criticized Sessions' record on race during his confirmation hearings.\n\nPaul opposes all forms of gun control as a violation of Second Amendment rights, including provisions of the Patriot Act. His advocacy of personal property rights includes introducing House Bill S. 890, the Defense of Environment and Property Act of 2012. Provisions of the bill include restricting the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies to \"impinge upon states' power over land and water use.\" The bill holds requires Federal agencies to reimburse private property owners double the amount of any economic losses arising from new Federal regulations \"that relate to the definition of navigable waters or waters of the United States\", and holds the enforcement of any such regulation in abeyance until such payments are complete.\nUnlike his more stridently \"non-interventionist\" father, Paul concedes a role for American armed forces abroad, including permanent foreign military bases. He has said that he blames supporters of the Iraq War and not President Obama for the growth in violence that occurred in 2014, and that the Iraq War \"emboldened\" Iran. Dick Cheney, John McCain and Rick Perry responded by calling Paul an isolationist, but Paul has pointed to opinion polls of likely GOP primary voters as support for his position. Paul stated, referring to ISIS: \"I personally believe that this group would not be in Iraq and would not be as powerful had we not been supplying their allies in the war [against Syrian Bashar al-Assad's government].\"\n\nPaul then supported airstrikes against ISIS, but questioned the constitutionality of Obama's unilateral actions without a clear congressional mandate. Paul has stated concerns about arms sent to Syrian rebels that wind up in unfriendly hands. In 2015, Paul called for a defense budget of $697 billion in 2016. In 2011, shortly after being elected, he proposed a budget which specified $542 billion in defense spending.\n\nOn February 2, 2015, Paul generated controversy by suggesting that states should not require parents to vaccinate their children, because parents should have the freedom to make that decision for their children. In an interview with CNBC on February 2, Paul clarified this statement, commenting \"I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, and it is an issue of freedom.\" On February 3, he posted a photograph to Twitter of himself being vaccinated.\n\nIn 2016, Paul was one of the first members of Congress to come out in opposition to United States support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In June 2017, Paul tried to block Trump administration's plan to sell more weapons to Saudi Arabia. In April 2018, he again criticized the U.S.-Saudi Arabia alliance, highlighting that \"Saudi Arabia has funded radical madrassas, teaching hatred of America throughout the world, and that Saudi Arabia also supplied arms to ISIS in the Syrian civil war.\" Paul said that U.S.-backed Saudi blockade of Yemen has further aggravated the humanitarian crisis in the country.\n\nPaul, like father, has also been a critic of neoconservatism, and urged Trump to not choose prominent neoconservative Elliott Abrams to serve as Deputy Secretary of State. In April 2018, Paul voted for the confirmation of Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State. Paul had previously insisted that he would not confirm Pompeo, citing Pompeo's hawkish foreign policy beliefs.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, U.S. senators reached an agreement on legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia and Iran. The bill was opposed only by Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders. In July 2018, shortly after 12 Russian intelligence officers have been charged with hacking and leaking emails of senior Democrats, he described the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election as a \"witch hunt on the president\". That same month, Paul blocked a Senate resolution that backed the intelligence community's assessment of Russian election interference and called on President Trump to speak with special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nIn July 2018, Paul was among only two Senators to vote against a Senate motion supporting NATO.\n\nPaul is married to Kelley Paul (née Ashby), a freelance writer. They and their three sons reside in Bowling Green, Kentucky. They are active members of the Presbyterian church.\n\nPaul is deaf in one ear.\n\nOn November 3, 2017, Paul was assaulted by a neighbor, Rene Boucher (then aged 59), a retired anesthesiologist. Paul, who is deaf in one ear, was wearing noise-cancelling headphones while mowing his lawn, enabling Boucher to blindside Paul.\n\nBoucher was arrested and charged with one count of fourth-degree assault and released on a $7,500 bond. Paul sustained five broken ribs, of which three were displaced fractures.\n\nVoter records from March 2017 showed Boucher registered as a Democrat, but his attorney, Matthew Baker, said there was no political motivation for the assault, descripting it as \"a very regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial\".\n\nBoucher was originally charged in Kentucky state court, but was later charged in federal court, where he ultimately pleaded guilty to assaulting a member of Congress.

At the age of 13, she joined the Heraka religious movement of her cousin Haipou Jadonang. The movement later turned into a political movement seeking to drive out the British from Manipur and the surrounding Naga areas. Within the Heraka faith, she came to be considered an incarnation of the Goddess Cherachamdinliu. Gaidinliu was arrested in 1932 at the age of 16, and was sentenced to life imprisonment by the British rulers. Jawaharlal Nehru met her at Shillong Jail in 1937, and promised to pursue her release. Nehru gave her the title of \"Rani\" (\"Queen\"), and she gained local popularity as Rani Gaidinliu.\n\nShe was released in 1947 after India's independence, and continued to work for the upliftment of her people. An advocate of the ancestral Naga religious practices, she staunchly resisted the conversion of Nagas to Christianity. She was honoured as a freedom fighter and was awarded a Padma Bhushan by the Government of India.\n\nGaidinliu was born on 26 January 1915 at Nungkao (or Longkao) village in the present-day Tousem sub-division of Tamenglong District, Manipur. She was from the Rongmei tribe (also known as Kabui). She was the fifth of eight children, including six sisters and a younger brother, born to Lothonang Pamei and Kachaklenliu. The family belonged to the ruling clan of the village. She did not have a formal education due to the lack of schools in the area.\n\nIn 1927, when she was just 13, Gaidinliu joined the \"Heraka\" movement of her cousin Haipou Jadonang, who had emerged as a prominent local leader. Jadonang's movement was a revival of the Naga tribal religion. It also aimed to end the British rule and establish the self-rule of the Nagas (\"Naga Raj\"). It attracted a number of followers from the Zeliangrong tribes (the Zeme, Liangmai and Rongmei). With the arrival of guns from Cachar, it turned into an armed rebellion against the British policies of forced labour and ruthless oppression.\n\nPersuaded by Jadonang's ideology and principles, Gaidinliu became his disciple and a part of his movement against the British. In three years, by the age of 16, she became a leader of guerrilla forces fighting against the British rulers.\n\nAfter Jadonang was arrested and hanged by the British in 1931, Gaidinliu emerged as his spiritual and political heir.\n\nShe openly rebelled against the British rule, exhorting the Zeliangrong people not to pay taxes. She received donations from the local Nagas, many of whom also joined her as volunteers. The British authorities launched a manhunt for her. She evaded arrest by the police, moving across villages in what are now Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. The Governor of Assam dispatched the 3rd and 4th battalions of the Assam Rifles against her, under the supervision of the Naga Hills Deputy Commissioner JP Mills. Monetary rewards were declared for information leading to her arrest: this included a declaration that any village providing information on her whereabouts will get a 10-year tax break. Her forces engaged the Assam Rifles in armed conflicts in the North Cachar Hills (16 February 1932) and the Hangrum village (18 March 1932).\n\nIn October 1932, Gaidinliu moved to the Pulomi village, where her followers started building a wooden fortress. While the fortress was under construction, an Assam Rifles contingent headed by Captain MacDonald launched a surprise attack on the village on 17 October 1932. Gaidinliu, along with her followers, was arrested without any resistance near the Kenoma village. Gaidinliu denied that she had any role in the attack on the Hangrum post of the Assam Rifles or the construction of the fort. In December 1932, her followers from the Leng and the Bopungwemi villages murdered the Kuki chowkidar (watchman) of the Lakema Inspection Bungalow in the Naga Hills, suspecting him to be the informer who led to her arrest. Gaidinliu was taken to Imphal, where she was convicted on the charges of murder and abetment of murder after a 10-month trial. She was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Political Agent's Court for abetment of murder. Most of her associates were either executed or jailed.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1947 she served time at the Guwahati, Shillong, Aizawl and Tura jails. Many rebels proclaimed her and Jadonang to be their inspiration in refusing to pay taxes to the British. However, her movement declined after the last of her followers, Dikeo and Ramjo, were arrested in 1933. Jawaharlal Nehru met her at the Shillong Jail in 1937 and he promised to pursue her release. His statement, published in the Hindustan Times, described Gaidinliu as a daughter of the hills and he gave her the title 'Rani' or Queen of her people. Nehru wrote to the British MP Lady Astor to do something for the release of Rani Gaidinliu but the Secretary of State for India rejected her request stating that trouble may rise again if Rani was released.\n\nAfter the Interim Government of India was set up in 1946, Rani Gaidinliu was released on Prime Minister Nehru's orders from Tura jail, having spent 14 years in various prisons. She continued to work for the upliftment of her people after her release. She stayed at Vimrap village of Tuensang with her younger brother Marang till 1952. In 1952, she was finally allowed to move back to her native village of Longkao. In 1953, Prime Minister Nehru visited Imphal where Rani Gaidinliu met and conveyed to him the gratitude and goodwill of her people. Later she met Nehru in Delhi to discuss the development and welfare of Zeliangrong people.\n\nGaidinliu was opposed to the Naga National Council (NNC) insurgents, who advocated secessionism from India. Instead, she campaigned for a separate Zeliangrong territory within the Union of India. The rebel Naga leaders criticized Gaidinliu’s movement for the integration of Zeliangrong tribes under one administrative unit. They were also opposed to her working for the revival of the traditional Naga religion of animism or \"Heraka\". The NNC leaders considered her actions an obstacle to their own movement. The Baptist leaders deemed the \"Heraka\" revival movement anti-Christian and she was warned of serious consequences if she were not to change her stand. In order to defend the \"Heraka\" culture and to strengthen her position, she went underground in 1960. She organized a private army of about a thousand men equipped rifles to defend and press for her demand for a single Zeliangrong district. In response to Phizo's declaration of the \"Naga Federal Government\", she set up her own quasi-administration named the \"Zeliangrong Government of Rani Party\". In 1964, the overground Zeliangrong leaders in consultation with underground leaders led by Rani Gaidinliu, demanded \"a separate Zeliangrong Administrative Unit or Political Unit\" within the Union of India. On 29 January 1965, her followers kidnapped and killed nine Naga rebels from the Ngulong village of the Kohima district, causing great uproar.\n\nIn 1966, after six years of hard underground life in old age, under an agreement with the Government of India, Rani Gaidinliu came out from her jungle hideout to work for the betterment of her people through peaceful, democratic and non-violent means. She went to Kohima on 20 January 1966, and met the Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in Delhi on 21 February 1966, demanding the creation of a separate Zeliangrong administrative unit. On 24 September 320 of her followers surrendered at Henima. Some of them were absorbed into the Nagaland Armed Police.\n\nDuring her stay at Kohima, she was conferred \"Tamrapatra Freedom Fighter Award\" in 1972, the Padma Bhushan (1982) and the Vivekananda Seva Award (1983).\n\nIn 1991, Gaidinliu returned to her birthplace Longkao, where she died on 17 February 1993 at the age of 78.\n\nThe Governor of Manipur, Chintamani Panigrahi, the Home Secretary of Nagaland, officials from Manipur and many people from all parts of the North Eastern region attended her funeral at her native village. In Imphal, the Chief Minister of Manipur R.K. Dorendro Singh, Deputy Chief Minister, Rishang Keishing and others paid floral tributes and a general holiday was declared by the State Government.\n\nRani Gaidinliu was also conferred the \"Birsa Munda Award\" posthumously. The Government of India issued a postal stamp in her honour in 1996. The Government of India issued a commemorative coin in her honour in 2015.\n\nBecause of the Heraka movement's hostility towards Christianity, Gaidinliu's heroics were not acknowledged highly among the Nagas, most of whom had converted to Christianity by the 1960s. The Naga nationalist groups don't recognize her either, because she was considered close to the Government of India. When the Hindu nationalist Sangh Parivar aligned with the Heraka movement in the 1970s, the perception that she was a promoter of Hinduism grew stronger among the Christian Nagas.\n\nIn 2015, when the Central government and T. R. Zeliang's state government decided to construct a Gaidinliu memorial hall, several civil society organizations in the Nagaland state opposed the move.\n"}

Park\n\nRobert Lee Park (born January 16, 1931) is an American emeritus professor of physics at the University of Maryland, College Park, and a former director of public information at the Washington office of the American Physical Society. Park is most noted for his critical commentaries on alternative medicine and pseudoscience, as well as his criticism of how legitimate science is distorted or ignored by the media, some scientists, and public policy advocates as expressed in his book \"Voodoo Science\". He is also noted for his preference for robotic over manned space exploration.\n\nPark was born in 1931 in Kansas City, Missouri. His father was a lawyer and a farmer in southern Texas, and Park had originally intended to attend law school himself. He entered the Air Force in 1951 and served (among other places) at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico until 1956. When the Air Force sent him to radar school, he discovered a passion for physics.\n\nPark obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics at the University of Texas at Austin in 1958 and 1960, and his Ph.D. in physics at Brown University in 1964. During his graduate work he was associated with physicist Harrison E. Farnsworth with whom he co-authored several papers.\n\nPark spent almost a decade working as a member of the technical staff, and later director of the Surface Physics Division, at Sandia National Laboratories, a U.S. government weapons research laboratory. In 1974, Park took a faculty position at the University of Maryland physics department, where he remained until retirement. He was director of UMD's Center of Materials Research from 1975 to 1978 and chairman of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 1978 to 1982.\n\nHe is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Vacuum Society.\n\nFrom 1983 until 2006, he was director of public information at the Washington office of the American Physical Society. In this role (which he established), he engaged politicians and the press on matters of science and public policy. The Washington office now employs six people and Park continues in an advisory capacity. He has been seen in the media as an outspoken critic of human spaceflight, efforts to colonize space, and the prototype U.S. National Missile Defense (as well as its predecessor SDI).\n\nSince 2013, Park has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\nPark writes a column, \"What's New\", which appears on the University of Maryland's website. It features discussions on topics such as science news, space exploration, energy, the government in science, pseudoscience, alternative medicine, the creation-evolution controversy, and nuclear weapons. Park has also expressed his opinion that Wikipedia is a target for misuse by the \"purveyors of pseudoscience\", though he has also stated that he finds the site to be both indispensable and \"cool\". In 2009 Park gave a public lecture at Dartmouth College on Malthusian overpopulation and the environment. He called for the distribution of the birth control pill, \"arguably the most important technological development in history\", to reduce fertility rates in developing nations. Park has criticized Texas A&M University's Trotter Prize for being awarded to creationist and intelligent design advocate William A. Dembski, whom Park calls \"one of the nation's top pseudoscientists\", for inappropriately forcing religion and science together.\n\nIn 2000 Park published the book \"Voodoo Science\", which addressed and criticized topics such as alternative medicine, telepathy and homeopathy. Reviewing the book for \"The New York Times\", Ed Regis compared it positively to the 1957 book by Martin Gardner, \"Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science\", calling \"Voodoo Science\" a \"worthy successor\" and praising it for explaining why various purportedly scientific claims were in fact impossible.\nScience fiction author Charles Platt reviewed the book for \"The Washington Post\", criticizing it for citing news stories as the inspiration for his criticisms and using \"ad hominem\" attacks against individuals criticized rather than performing a more thorough investigation of the topics, and speaking with the actual researchers. This was followed by a number of letters to the editor criticizing Platt for bias. \n\nIn 2010 Park published his second book, \"Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science\". \"Publishers Weekly\" called the book \"disjointed\", unfavorably comparing it to Daniel Dennett's \"\" for merely summarizing the existing arguments about science and religion. Park commented that the reviewer for \"Publishers Weekly\" was offended at his assertion that \"science is the only way of knowing.\" \"Booklist\" reviewed the book positively for its lucid style, engaging with respected scientists who also hold strong religious faith and its internal logic against claims of supernatural revelation and New Age irrationality. The same review noted that Park was less compelling in addressing his own atheism, neurochemistry and its ability to address problems such as free will.\n\nPark is married to Gerry and lives in Adelphi, Maryland. They have two sons, Robert Jr. and Daniel, and three grandchildren.\n\nOn September 3, 2000, Park was hospitalized after being struck by a falling oak tree. He later wrote about the experience in his book, \"Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science\".\n\nPark suffered a hemorrhagic stroke on March 17, 2013, which resulted in difficulty with reading, writing, and speech. In a newsletter update to his readers dated July 12, 2013, Park wrote, \"Many wonderful people are helping me, but recovery is a long process. I am optimistic that I will resume writing What’s New.\" Park stated that he will continue writing his newsletter because \"the public is often misled by reports in the media and unaware of it\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "331379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331379", "title": "Scott Carpenter", "text": "Scott Carpenter\n\nMalcolm Scott Carpenter (May 1, 1925 – October 10, 2013), (Cmdr, USN), was an American naval officer and aviator, test pilot, aeronautical engineer, astronaut, and aquanaut. He was one of the original seven astronauts selected for NASA's Project Mercury in April 1959. Carpenter was the second American (after John Glenn) to orbit the Earth and the fourth American in space, following Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, and Glenn.\n\nBorn May 1, 1925, in Boulder, Colorado, Carpenter moved to New York City with his parents Marion Scott Carpenter and Florence Kelso Carpenter for the first 3 years of his life. His father had been awarded a postdoctoral research post at Columbia University. In the summer of 1927, Scott returned to Boulder with his mother, then ill with tuberculosis. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in the family home at the corner of Aurora Avenue and Seventh Street, until his graduation from Boulder High School in 1943.\nIt was claimed that Carpenter named his spacecraft \"Aurora 7\" after Aurora Avenue, but he denied this.\n\nHe was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Second Class Scout.\n\nUpon graduation, he was accepted into the V-12 Navy College Training Program as an aviation cadet (V-12a) at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. After a year there, he spent six months in training at St. Mary's Preflight School, Moraga, California, and four months in primary flight training at Ottumwa, Iowa. World War II ended before he was able to finish training and receive an overseas assignment, so the Navy released him from active duty.\n\nHe returned to Boulder in November 1945 to study aeronautical engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder. While at Colorado he joined Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. At the end of his senior year, he missed the final examination in heat transfer, leaving him one requirement short of a degree. After his Mercury flight, the university granted him a Bachelor of Science because \"his subsequent training as an astronaut [...] more than made up for the deficiency in the subject of heat transfer.\"\n\nOn the eve of the Korean War, Carpenter was recruited by the United States Navy's Direct Procurement Program (DPP). He reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in the fall of 1949 for pre-flight and primary flight training. He earned his aviator wings on April 19, 1951, in Corpus Christi, Texas. He spent three months in the Fleet Airborne Electronics Training School, San Diego, California, and was in a Lockheed P2 Neptune transitional training unit at Whidbey Island, Washington, until October 1951. In November 1951, he was assigned to Patrol Squadron 6 (VP-6) based at Naval Air Station Barbers Point, Hawaii. During his first tour of duty, on his first deployment, Carpenter flew on reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions during the Korean War. Forward-based in Naval Air Facility Adak, Alaska, Carpenter then flew surveillance missions along the Soviet and Chinese coasts during his second deployment; designated as PPC (patrol plane commander) for his third deployment, LTJG Carpenter was based with his squadron in Guam.\n\nCarpenter was then appointed to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, Class 13, at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland in 1954. He continued at Patuxent until 1957, working as a test pilot in the Electronics Test Division; in this assignment Carpenter conducted flight test projects in a variety of Navy airplanes, including multi- and single-engine jet aircraft and propeller-driven fighters, attack planes, patrol bombers and seaplanes. In his next tour of duty was spent in Monterey, California, at the Navy Line School. After attending the Naval Air Intelligence School, Washington D.C., for an additional eight months in 1957 and 1958, Carpenter was named Air Intelligence Officer for .\n\nAfter being chosen for Project Mercury in 1959, Carpenter, along with the other six astronauts, oversaw the development of the Mercury capsule. He served as backup pilot for John Glenn, who flew the first U.S. orbital mission aboard \"Friendship 7\" in February 1962. Carpenter, serving as capsule communicator on this flight, can be heard saying \"Godspeed, John Glenn\" on the recording of Glenn's liftoff.\n\nWhen Deke Slayton was withdrawn on medical grounds from Project Mercury's second manned orbital flight (which Slayton would have named \"Delta 7\"), Carpenter was assigned to replace him. He flew into space on May 24, 1962, atop the Mercury-Atlas 7 rocket for a three-orbit science mission that lasted nearly five hours. His \"Aurora 7\" spacecraft attained a maximum altitude of and an orbital velocity of .\n\nCarpenter performed five onboard experiments per the flight plan, and became the first American astronaut to eat solid food in space. He also identified the mysterious \"fireflies\" observed by Glenn during \"Friendship 7\" as particles of frozen liquid loosened from the outside of the spacecraft, which he could produce by rapping on the wall near the window. He renamed them \"frostflies\".\n\nCarpenter's performance in space was the subject of criticism and controversy. NASA's 1989 official history of Project Mercury says that until the third pass over Hawaii, Christopher C. Kraft, Jr. (who directed the flight from Cape Canaveral) \"considered this mission the most successful to date; everything had gone perfectly except for some overexpenditure of fuel\", However, then problems worsened and Kraft wrote in his 2001 memoir (as quoted by \"New York Times\" in Carpenter's obituary) “He was completely ignoring our request to check his instruments. (…) I swore an oath that Scott Carpenter would never again fly in space.\"\n\nUnnoticed by ground control or pilot, however, the overexpenditure of fuel was caused by an intermittently malfunctioning pitch horizon scanner (PHS) that later malfunctioned at reentry. Still, NASA later reported that Carpenter had:\n\nexercised his manual controls with ease in a number of [required] spacecraft maneuvers and had made numerous and valuable observations in the interest of space science. ... By the time he drifted near Hawaii on the third pass, Carpenter had successfully maintained more than 40 percent of his fuel in both the automatic and the manual tanks. According to mission rules, this ought to be quite enough hydrogen peroxide, reckoned Kraft, to thrust the capsule into the retrofire attitude, hold it, and then to reenter the atmosphere using either the automatic or the manual control system.\n\nAt the retrofire event, the pitch horizon scanner malfunctioned once more, forcing Carpenter to manually control his reentry, which caused him to overshoot the planned splashdown point by . (\"The malfunction of the pitch horizon scanner circuit [a component of the automatic control system] dictated that the pilot manually control the spacecraft attitudes during this event.\") The PHS malfunction jerked the spacecraft off in yaw by 25 degrees to the right, accounting for of the overshoot; the delay caused by the automatic sequencer required Carpenter to fire the retrorockets manually. This effort took two pushes of the override button and accounted for another 15 to of the overshoot. The loss of thrust in the ripple pattern of the retros added another , producing a overshoot.\n\nDuring reentry, there was a great deal of concern over whether Carpenter had actually survived, since he splashed down 250 miles off course. There are two accounts of the \"Aurora 7\" recovery, the first being that forty minutes after splashdown, Carpenter was located in his life raft, safe and in good health by Major Fred Brown under the command of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard, and recovered three hours later by the , and the second being that a P-2 Neptune from Patrol Squadron 18 flying out of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads was the first to sight and mark Carpenter's position.\n\nPostflight analysis described the PHS malfunction as \"mission critical\" but noted that the pilot \"adequately compensated\" for \"this anomaly ... in subsequent inflight procedures\", confirming that backup systems—human pilots—could succeed when automatic systems fail.\n\nSome memoirs have revived the simmering controversy over who or what, exactly, was to blame for the overshoot, suggesting, for example, that Carpenter was distracted by the science and engineering experiments dictated by the flight plan and by the well-reported fireflies phenomenon. Yet fuel consumption and other aspects of the vehicle operation were, during Project Mercury, as much, if not more, the responsibility of the ground controllers. Moreover, hardware malfunctions went unidentified, while organizational tensions between the astronaut office and the flight controller office—tensions that NASA did not resolve until the later Gemini and Apollo programs—may account for much of the latter-day criticism of Carpenter's performance during his flight.\n\nCarpenter never flew another mission in space. After taking a leave of absence from the astronaut corps in the fall of 1963 to train for and participate in the Navy's SEALAB program, Carpenter sustained a medically grounding injury to his left arm in a motorbike accident. After failing to regain mobility in his arm after two surgical interventions (in 1964 and 1967), Carpenter was ruled ineligible for spaceflight. He resigned from NASA in August 1967. He spent the last part of his NASA career developing underwater training to help astronauts with future spacewalks.\n\nIn July 1964 in Bermuda, Carpenter sustained a grounding injury from a motorbike accident while on leave from NASA to train for the Navy's SEALAB project. In 1965, for SEALAB II, he spent 28 days living on the ocean floor off the coast of California. During the SEALAB II mission, Carpenter's right index finger was wounded by the toxic spines of a scorpion fish. He returned to work at NASA as Executive Assistant to the Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center, then returned to the Navy's Deep Submergence Systems Project in 1967, based in Bethesda, Maryland, as a Director of Aquanaut Operations for SEALAB III.\n\nIn the aftermath of aquanaut Berry L. Cannon's death while attempting to repair a leak in SEALAB III, Carpenter volunteered to dive down to SEALAB and help return it to the surface, although SEALAB was ultimately salvaged in a less hazardous way.\n\nCarpenter retired from the Navy as Commander in 1969, after which he founded Sea Sciences, Inc., a corporation for developing programs for utilizing ocean resources and improving environmental health.\n\nCarpenter was married four times, divorced three times, and had a total of seven children by three wives.\n\nCarpenter married his first wife Rene Louise Price (born 1928) in 1948. They had four children: Marc Scott (deceased), Kristen Elaine, Candace Noxon, and Robyn Jay. By 1968, Carpenter and his wife had separated, with him living in California and Rene Carpenter having moved with their children to Washington, D.C. The Carpenters divorced in 1972.\n\nIn 1972, Carpenter married his second wife Maria Roach, daughter of film producer Hal Roach. Together, they had two children: Matthew Scott and Nicholas Andre, who would later become a filmmaker.\n\nIn 1988, Carpenter married his third wife, Barbara Curtin. Their marriage produced a son, Zachary Scott, when Carpenter was in his 60s. The marriage ended in divorce a few years later.\n\nIn 1999, Carpenter married his fourth wife Patty Barrett, when he was 74. They resided in Vail, Colorado.\n\nIn September 2013, Carpenter suffered a stroke and, after hospitalization, was admitted to the Denver Hospice Inpatient Care Center. He died on October 10, 2013 at the age of 88. Carpenter was survived by his wife at the time of his death, six children, a granddaughter, and five step-grandchildren.\n\nCarpenter received:\n\n\n\nIn 1962, Boulder community leaders dedicated Scott Carpenter Park and Pool in honor of native son turned Mercury astronaut. The Aurora 7 Elementary School, also in Boulder, was named for Carpenter's spacecraft. Scott Carpenter Middle School in Westminster, Colorado, was named in his honor, as was M. Scott Carpenter Elementary School in Old Bridge, New Jersey.\n\nThe Scott Carpenter Space Analog Station was placed on the ocean floor in 1997 and 1998. It was named in honor of his SEALAB work in the 1960s.\n\nSpeaking from the blockhouse at the launch of \"Friendship 7\", Carpenter, John Glenn's backup pilot, said \"Godspeed, John Glenn,\" as Glenn's vehicle rose off the launch pad to begin his first U.S. orbital mission on February 20, 1962. This quote was included in the voiceovers of the teaser trailer for the 2009 \"Star Trek\" film. The audio phrase is used in Kenny G's \"Auld Lang Syne\" (The Millennium Mix). It is also used as a part of an audio introduction for the Ian Brown song \"My Star\".\n\nCarpenter has been reported also to have said, prior to the \"Godspeed\" comment, \"Remember, John, this was built by the low bidder\". This comment is sometimes improperly attributed to Glenn.\n\nIn the 1983 film, \"The Right Stuff\", Carpenter was played by Charles Frank. Although his appearance was relatively minor, the film played up Carpenter's friendship with John Glenn, as played by Ed Harris. This film is based on the book of the same name by Tom Wolfe.\n\nThe character of Scott Tracy in the \"Thunderbirds\" television series was named after Carpenter. \nCarpenter's recovery from the ocean following his space flight is referred to in the \"Peanuts\" comic strip of June 28, 1962, after Linus' security blanket is rescued.\n\nIn the 2015 ABC TV series \"The Astronaut Wives Club\", Scott Carpenter is portrayed by Wilson Bethel and Rene Carpenter is portrayed by Yvonne Strahovski.\n\n\n"}

He was an adherent of the Madhyamaka philosophy of Nagarjuna.\n\nThe \"Zhansi Lun\" of the East Asian Mādhyamaka identifies two different individuals given the name \"Shant inideva\": their founder of the Avaivartika Sangha in the 6th century and a later Shantideva who studied at Nalanda in the 8th century and appears to be the source of the Tibetan biographies. Archaeological discoveries support this thesis. Two Tibetan sources of the life of Shantideva are the historians Buton Rinchen Drub and Tāranātha. Recent scholarship has brought to light a short Sanskrit life of Shantideva in a 14th-century Nepalese manuscript. An accessible account that follows the Butön closely can be found in Kunzang Pelden, \"The Nectar of Manjushri's speech\".\n\nShantideva was born in the Saurastra (in modern Gujarat), son of King Kalyanavarman, and he went by the name Śantivarman.\n\nAccording to Pema Chödrön, \"Shantideva was not well liked at Nalanda.\"\n\nAfter being goaded into giving a talk to the entire university body, Shantideva delivered \"The Way of the Bodhisattva\".\n\nThe \"Śikṣāsamuccaya\" (“Training Anthology”) is a prose work in nineteen chapters. It is organized as a commentary on twenty-seven short mnemonic verses known as the \"Śikṣāsamuccaya Kārikā\". It consists primarily of quotations (of varying length) from sūtras, authoritative texts considered to be the word of the Buddha — generally those sūtras associated with Mahāyāna tradition, including the \"Samadhiraja Sutra\".\n\nShantideva is particularly renowned as the author of the \"Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra\". A variety of English translations exist, sometimes glossed as \"A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life\" or \"Entering the Path of Enlightenment.\" It is a long poem describing the process of enlightenment from the first thought to full buddhahood and is still studied by Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhists today.\n\nAn introduction to and commentary on the \"Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra\" by the 14th Dalai Lama called \"A Flash of Lightning in the Dark of Night\" was printed in 1994. A commentary on the Patience chapter was provided by the Dalai Lama in \"Healing Anger\" (1997), and his commentaries on the Wisdom chapter can be found in \"Practicing Wisdom\" (2004). Kunzang Palden has written a commentary based on that given by Patrul Rinpoche, translated by the Padmakara Translation Group. Patrul Rinpoche was a wandering monk of great scholarship, who dedicated his life to the propagation of the \"Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "825178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=825178", "title": "Sherman Alexie", "text": "Sherman Alexie\n\nSherman Joseph Alexie, Jr. (born October 7, 1966) is a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist, short story writer, poet, and filmmaker. His writings draw on his experiences as an Indigenous American with ancestry from several tribes. He grew up on the Spokane Indian Reservation and now lives in Seattle, Washington.\n\nHis best-known book is \"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\" (1993), a collection of short stories. It was adapted as the film \"Smoke Signals\" (1998), for which he also wrote the screenplay.\n\nHis first novel \"Reservation Blues\" received one of the fifteen 1996 American Book Awards.\nHis first young adult novel, \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" (2007), is a semi-autobiographical novel that won the 2007 U.S. National Book Award for Young People's Literature and the Odyssey Award as best 2008 audiobook for young people (read by Alexie). His 2009 collection of short stories and poems, \"War Dances\", won the 2010 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction.\n\nAlexie is the guest editor of the 2015 \"Best American Poetry.\"\n\nAlexie was born on October 7, 1966, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, Washington. As a little child he lived on the Spokane Indian Reservation, located west of Spokane. His father, Sherman Joseph Alexie, was a member of the Coeur d'Alene tribe, and his mother, Lillian Agnes Cox, was of Colville, Choctaw, Spokane and European American ancestry. One of his paternal great-grandfathers was of Russian descent. Alexie was born with hydrocephalus, a condition that occurs when there is an abnormally large amount of cerebral fluid in the nasal cavity. He had to have brain surgery when he was six months old, and was at high risk of death or mental disabilities if he survived. Alexie's surgery was successful; he suffered no mental damage but\nhad other side effects.\n\nHis parents were alcoholics, though his mother achieved sobriety. His father often left the house on drinking binges for days at a time. To support her six children, Alexie's mother, Lillian, sewed quilts, worked as a clerk at the Wellpinit Trading Post and had some other jobs.\n\nAlexie has described his life at the reservation school as challenging because he was constantly teased by other kids and endured abuse he described as \"torture\" from white nuns who taught there. They called him \"The Globe\" because his head was larger than usual, due to suffering hydrocephalus as an infant. Until the age of seven, Alexie suffered from seizures and bedwetting; he had to take strong drugs to control them. Because of his health problems, he was excluded from many of the activities that are rites of passage for young Indian males. Alexie excelled academically, reading everything available, including auto repair manuals.\n\nIn order to better his education, Alexie decided to leave the reservation and attend high school in Reardan, Washington. The school was twenty-two miles off the reservation and Alexie was the only Native American student. He excelled at his studies and became a star player on the basketball team, the Reardan High School Indians. He was elected as class president and participated as a member of the debate team.\n\nHis successes in high school won him a scholarship in 1985 to Gonzaga University, a Roman Catholic university in Spokane. Originally, Alexie enrolled in the pre-med program with hopes of becoming a doctor, but found he was squeamish during dissection in his anatomy classes. Alexie switched to law, but found that was not suitable, either. He felt enormous pressure to succeed in college, and consequently, he began drinking heavily to cope with his anxiety. Unhappy with law, Alexie found comfort in literature classes.\n\nIn 1987, he dropped out of Gonzaga and enrolled at Washington State University (WSU), where he took a creative writing course taught by Alex Kuo, a respected poet of Chinese-American background. Alexie was at a low point in his life, and Kuo served as a mentor to him. Kuo gave Alexie an anthology entitled \"Songs of This Earth on Turtle's Back\", by Joseph Bruchac. Alexie said this book changed his life as it taught him \"how to connect to non-Native literature in a new way\". He was inspired by reading works of poetry written by Native Americans.\n\nWith his new appreciation of poetry, Alexie started working on what was published as his first collection, \"The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems\", published in 1992 through Hanging Loose Press. With that success, Alexie stopped drinking and quit school just three credits short of a degree. However, in 1995, he was awarded a bachelor's degree from Washington State University.\n\nIn 2005, Alexie became a founding board member of Longhouse Media, a non-profit organization that is committed to teaching filmmaking skills to Native American youth and using media for cultural expression and social change. Alexie has long supported youth programs and initiatives dedicated to supporting at-risk Native youth.\n\nAlexie is married to Diane Tomhave, who is of Hidatsa, Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi heritage. They live in Seattle with their two sons.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, Alexie published a statement regarding accusations of sexual harassment against him by several women, including author Litsa Dremousis, with whom he'd had a consensual affair in the past and who claimed numerous women had spoken to her about Alexie's behavior. Dremousis' response initially appeared on her Facebook page and was subsequently reprinted in \"The Stranger\" on March 1, 2018. The fallout from these accusations includes the Institute of American Indian Arts renaming its Sherman Alexie Scholarship as the MFA Alumni Scholarship. The blog \"Native Americans in Children's Literature\" has deleted or modified all references to Alexie. In February 2018 it was reported that the American Library Association, which had just awarded Alexie its Carnegie Medal for \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me: A Memoir\", was reconsidering, and in March it was confirmed that Alexie had declined the award and was postponing the publication of a paperback version of the memoir. The American Indian Library Association rescinded its 2008 Best Young Adult Book Award from Alexie for \"The Absolute True Diary of a Part Time Indian\", “to send an unequivocal message that Alexie’s actions are unacceptable.”\n\nAlexie's stories have been included in several short story anthologies, including \"The Best American Short Stories\" 2004, edited by Lorrie Moore; and \"Pushcart Prize\" XXIX of the Small Presses. Additionally, a number of his pieces have been published in various literary magazines and journals, as well as online publications.\n\nAlexie's poetry, short stories and novels explore themes of despair, poverty, violence and alcoholism among the lives of Native American people, both on and off the reservation. They are lightened by wit and humor. According to Sarah A. Quirk from the \"Dictionary of Library Biography,\" Alexie asks three questions across all of his works: \"What does it mean to live as an Indian in this time? What does it mean to be an Indian man? Finally, what does it mean to live on an Indian reservation?\" The protagonists in most of his literary works exhibit a constant struggle with themselves and their own sense of powerlessness in white American society.\n\nAlexie’s writings are meant to evoke sadness, but at the same time, he uses humor and pop culture that leave the readers with a sense of respect, understanding, and compassion. Alexie’s influences for his literary works do not rely solely on traditional Indian forms. He \"blends elements of popular culture, Indian spirituality, and the drudgery of poverty-ridden reservation life to create his characters and the world they inhabit,\" according to Quirk. Alexie's work is laced with often startling humor. According to Quirk, he does this as a \"means of cultural survival for American Indians—survival in the face of the larger American culture's stereotypes of American Indians and their concomitant distillation of individual tribal characteristics into one pan-Indian consciousness.\"\n\nIn 2012, Arizona's HB 2281 removed Alexie's works, along with those of others, from Arizona school curriculum. Alexie's response:\n\nWithin a year of graduating from college, Alexie received the Washington State Arts Commission Poetry Fellowship and the National Endowment for the Arts Poetry Fellowship. His career began with the publishing of his first two collections of poetry in 1992, entitled, \"I Would Steal Horses\" and \"The Business of Fancydancing.\" In these poems, Alexie uses humor to express the struggles of contemporary Indians on reservations. Common themes include alcoholism, poverty and racism. Although he uses humor to express his feelings, the underlying message is very serious.\n\n\"The Business of Fancydancing: Stories and Poems (1992)\" was well received, selling over 10,000 copies. Alexie refers to his writing as \"fancydancing,\" a flashy, colorful style of competitive Pow wow dancing. Whereas older, traditional forms of Indian dance may be ceremonial and kept private among tribal members, the fancydance style was created by Native American veterans from World War II as a form of public entertainment. Alexie compares the mental, emotional, and spiritual outlet that he finds in his writings to the vivid self-expression of the dancers. Leslie Ullman commented on \"The Business of Fancydancing\" in the \"Kenyon Review,\" writing that Alexie \"weaves a curiously soft-blended tapestry of humor, humility, pride and metaphysical provocation out of the hard realities...: the tin-shack lives, the alcohol dreams, the bad luck and burlesque disasters, and the self-destructive courage of his characters.\"\n\nAlexie's other collections of poetry include:\n\nAlexie published his first prose work, entitled \"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven,\" in 1993. The book consists of a series of short stories that are interconnected. Several prominent characters are explored, and they have been featured in later works by Alexie. According to Sarah A. Quirk, \"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\" can be considered a bildungsroman with dual protagonists, \"Victor Joseph and Thomas Builds-the-Fire, moving from relative innocence to a mature level on experience.\"\n\n\"Ten Little Indians\" (2004) is a collection of \"nine extraordinary short stories set in and around the Seattle area, featuring Spokane Indians from all walks of urban life,\" according to Christine C. Menefee of the \"School Library Journal\". In this collection, Alexie \"challenges stereotypes that whites have of Native Americans and at the same time shows the Native American characters coming to terms with their own identities.\"\n\n\"War Dances\" is a collection of short stories, poems, and short works. It won the 2010 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. The collection, however, received mixed reviews.\n\nOther short stories by Alexie include:\n\n\nIn his first novel, \"Reservation Blues\" (1995), Alexie revisits some of the characters from \"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.\" Thomas Builds-the-Fire, Victor Joseph, and Junior Polatkin, who have grown up together on the Spokane Indian reservation, were teenagers in the short story collection. In \"Reservation Blues\" they are now adult men in their thirties. Some of them are now musicians and in a band together. Verlyn Klinkenborg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in a 1995 review of \"Reservation Blues\": \"you can feel Alexie's purposely divided attention, his alertness to a divided audience, Native American and Anglo.\" Klinkenborg says that Alexie is \"willing to risk didacticism whenever he stops to explain the particulars of the Spokane and, more broadly, the Native American experience to his readers.\"\n\n\"Indian Killer\" (1996) is a murder mystery set among Native American adults in contemporary Seattle, where the characters struggle with urban life, mental health, and the knowledge that there is a serial killer on the loose. Characters deal with the racism in the University system, as well as in the community at large, where Indians are subjected to being lectured about their own culture by white professors who are actually ignorant of Indian cultures.\n\nAlexie's young adult novel, \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" (2007) is a coming-of-age story that began as a memoir of his life and family on the Spokane Indian reservation. The novel focuses on a fourteen-year-old Indian named Arnold Spirit. The novel is semi-autobiographical, including many events and elements of Alexie's life. For example, Arnold was born with hydrocephalus, and was teased a lot as a child. The story also portrays events after Arnold's transfer to Reardan High School, which Alexie attended. The novel received great reviews and continues to be a top seller. Bruce Barcott from the \"New York Times Book Review\" observed, \"Working in the voice of a 14-year-old forces Alexie to strip everything down to action and emotion, so that reading becomes more like listening to your smart, funny best friend recount his day while waiting after school for a ride home.\"\n\n\"Flight\" (2007) also features an adolescent protagonist. The narrator, who calls himself \"Zits,\" is a fifteen-year-old orphan of mixed Native and European ancestry who has bounced around the foster system in Seattle. The novel centers around experiences of the past, as Zits experiences short windows into others' lives after he believes to be shot while committing a crime.\n\nAlexie's memoir, \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,\" was released by Hachette in June 2017. Claudia Rowe of \"The Seattle Times\" wrote in June 2017 that the memoir \"pulls readers so deeply into the author’s youth on the Spokane Indian Reservation that most will forget all about facile comparisons and simply surrender to Alexie’s unmistakable patois of humor and profanity, history and pathos.\" Alexie cancelled his book tour in support of \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\" in July 2017 due to the emotional toll that promoting the book was taking. In September 2017, he decided to resume the tour, with some significant changes. As he related to Laurie Hertzel of The Star Tribune, “I’m not performing the book,” he said. “I’m getting interviewed. That’s a whole different thing.” He went on to add that he won’t be answering any questions that he doesn’t want to answer. “I’ll put my armor back on,” he said.\n\nIn 1998 Alexie broke barriers by creating the first all-Indian movie, \"Smoke Signals\". Alexie based the screenplay on his short story collection, \"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\", and characters and events from a number of Alexie's works make appearances in the film. \"Smoke Signals\" was directed by Chris Eyre, a Cheyenne-Arapaho Indian filmmaker, and the entire production team and cast is Native American. The film tells the story of two young Indians, Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds the Fire (Evan Adams), who leave the reservation on a road trip to retrieve the body of Victor's dead father (Gary Farmer). During their journey the characters' childhood is explored via flashbacks. The film took top honors at the Sundance Film Festival. It received an 86% and \"fresh\" rating from the online film database Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\"The Business of Fancydancing\", written and directed by Alexie in 2002, explores themes of Indian identity, cultural involvement vs blood quantum, living on the reservation or off it, and other issues around makes someone a \"real Indian.\" The title refers to the protagonist's choice to leave the reservation and make his living performing for predominantly-white audiences. Evan Adams, who plays Thomas Builds the Fire in \"Smoke Signals\", again stars, now as an urban gay man with a white partner. The death of a peer brings the protagonist home to the reservation, where he reunites with his friends from his childhood and youth. The film is unique in that Alexie hired an almost completely female crew to produce the film. Many of the actors improvised their dialogue, based on real events in their lives.\n\nOther film projects include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a brother of noted mural painter Gilbert White.\n\nBorn in Grand Rapids, Michigan, he attended Grand Rapids High School, and earned degrees from University of Michigan (B.A., 1895; M.A., 1903).\n\nFrom about 1900 until about 1922 he wrote fiction and non-fiction about adventure and travel, with an emphasis on natural history and outdoor living. Starting in 1922 he and his wife Elizabeth \"Betty\" Grant White wrote numerous books they say were received through channelling with spirits. They also wrote of their travels around the state of California. White died in Hillsborough, California.\nWhite's books were popular at a time when America was losing its vanishing wilderness. He was a keen observer of the beauties of nature and human nature, yet could render them in a plain-spoken style. Based on his own experience, whether writing camping journals or Westerns, he included pithy and fun details about cabin-building, canoeing, logging, gold-hunting, and guns and fishing and hunting. He also interviewed people who had been involved in the fur trade, the California gold rush and other pioneers which provided him with details that give his novels verisimilitude. He salted in humor and sympathy for colorful characters such as canny Indian guides and \"greenhorn\" campers who carried too much gear. White also illustrated some of his books with his own photographs, while some of his other books were illustrated by artists, such as the American Western painter Fernand Lungren for \"The Mountains\" and \"Camp and Trail\". Theodore Roosevelt wrote that White was \"the best man with both pistol and rifle who ever shot\" at Roosevelt's rifle range at Sagamore Hill.\n\n\"The Long Rifle\" (1930), \"Folded Hills\" (1932), \"Ranchero\" (1933), and \"Stampede\" (1942) constitute \"The Saga of Andy Burnett,\" which follows a young Pennsylvania farm boy who escapes his overbearing step father by running away to the West with grandmother's blessing and \"The Boone Gun\", the original Kentucky rifle carried by Daniel Boone. He encounters mountain man Joe Crane, who becomes his mentor in the ways of survival in the wild. The remainder of the saga follows Andy as he moves west, ultimately settling in California, which is the setting of the last three books. The series incorporates actual events and characters from the time period in the narrative. The four stories were published as a posthumous volume, \"The Saga of Andy Burnett\", in 1947, and were adapted into several episodes of \"The Wonderful World of Disney\" during 1957 and 1958, starring Jerome Courtland as Andy Burnett, and Jeff York (Mike Fink) as his friend and mentor Joe Crane. This series was in many ways a follow-up to Disney's much more successful \"Davy Crockett\".\n\nIn 1927 the Boy Scouts of America made White an \"Honorary Scout\", a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to \"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...\". The other eighteen who were awarded this distinction were: Roy Chapman Andrews; Robert Bartlett; Frederick Russell Burnham; Richard E. Byrd; George Kruck Cherrie; James L. Clark; Merian C. Cooper; Lincoln Ellsworth; Louis Agassiz Fuertes; George Bird Grinnell; Charles A. Lindbergh; Donald Baxter MacMillan; Clifford H. Pope; George P. Putnam; Kermit Roosevelt; Carl Rungius; Orville Wright.\n\n\nThese first two books are \"pre\" Betty´s book. White discusses the philosophy of the future books, without revealing the source (the channeling through his wife Betty).\n\n\n\n\n"}
