Kennedy who might have photographed the events that occurred in Dallas's Dealey Plaza at the time President John F. Kennedy was shot. Her nickname arose from the headscarf she wore, which was similar to scarves worn by elderly Russian women (бабушка – \"babushka\" – literally means \"grandmother\" or \"old woman\" in Russian).\n\nThe Babushka Lady was seen to be holding a camera by eyewitnesses and was also seen in film accounts of the assassination. She was observed standing on the grass between Elm and Main streets and is visible in the Zapruder film as well as in the films of Orville Nix, Marie Muchmore, and Mark Bell (44 minutes and 47 seconds into the Bell film: even though the shooting had already taken place and most of her surrounding witnesses took cover, she can be seen still standing with the camera at her face). After the shooting, she crossed Elm Street and joined the crowd that went up the grassy knoll. She is last seen in photographs walking east on Elm Street. Neither she, nor the film she may have taken, has yet been positively identified; no known photograph with her in frame captured her face because in all cases she was either facing away from the camera, or (as in the case of the Zapruder film) had her face obscured by her own camera.\n\nIn 1970, a woman named Beverly Oliver told conspiracy researcher Gary Shaw at a church revival meeting in Joshua, Texas that she was the Babushka Lady. Oliver stated that she filmed the assassination with a Super 8 film Yashica and that she turned the undeveloped film over to two men who identified themselves to her as FBI agents. According to Oliver, she obtained no receipt from the men who told her that they would return the film to her within ten days. She did not follow up with an inquiry. She reiterated her claims in the 1988 documentary \"The Men Who Killed Kennedy\". According to Vincent Bugliosi, Oliver \"has never proved to most people's satisfaction that she was in Dealey Plaza that day.\" Confronted with the fact that the Yashica Super-8 camera was not made until 1969, she stated that she received the \"experimental\" camera from a friend and was not even sure the manufacturer's name was on it.\n\nBeverly Oliver's claims were the basis for a scene in Oliver Stone's 1991 film \"JFK\", in which a character named \"Beverly\" meets Jim Garrison in a Dallas nightclub. Played by Lolita Davidovich, she is depicted in the director's cut as wearing a headscarf at Dealey Plaza and speaking of having given the film she shot to two men claiming to be FBI agents.\n\nIn March 1979, the Photographic Evidence Panel of the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations indicated that they were unable to locate any film attributed to the Babushka Lady. According to their report: \"Initially, Robert Groden, a photographic consultant to the committee advised the panel as to pertinent photographic issues and related materials. Committee investigators located many of the suggested films and photographs, however, some items were never located, i.e. the Babushka Lady film, a color photograph by Norman Similas, and the original negative of the Betzner photograph.\"\n\nOn November 18, 1994, assassination researcher Gary Mack testified before the Assassination Records Review Board that he had recently been told by an executive in Kodak's Dallas office that a woman in her early 30s with brunette hair brought in film purported to be of the assassination scene while they were processing the Zapruder film. According to Mack, the executive said the woman explained to federal investigators already at the film processing office that she ran from Main Street across the grass to Elm Street where she stopped and snapped a photo with some people in the foreground of the presidential limousine and the Texas School Book Depository. Mack said that he was told by the Kodak executive that the photo was extremely blurry and \"virtually useless\" and indicated that the woman likely went home without anyone recording her identification. After suggesting that the woman in the story may have been the Babushka Lady, Mack then told the Board: \"I do not believe that Beverly Oliver is the Babushka Lady, or, let me rephrase that, she certainly could be but the rest of the story is a fabrication.\"\n\nAlso appearing that same day before the ARRB as \"Beverly Oliver Massegee\", Oliver stated that she was 17 years old at the time of the assassination. She told the Board that she was filming with an \"experimental\" 8 mm movie camera approximately from Kennedy when he was shot and that the film was confiscated by a man who identified himself as an FBI agent. According to Oliver, she handed over the camera because the man was an authority figure and because she feared being caught in possession of marijuana.\n\n\n"}

According to Archive.org , the last date the Athal Energy website was archived, it was not an oil and gas company. It said the following:\n\"Athal is a distributor and wholesaler of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, hospital supplies, over the counter medicines and healthcare products.\"\n\nNo website currently exists at athal.ly.\n\nIn 2010 Igtet founded the Independent Libya Foundation (ILF) together with New York-based businessman Adam M. Hock. The ILF initially focused on supporting the fledgling rebel movement, and upon its founding, the Libyan National Transitional Council. Igtet lobbied for support from the international community to augment the process of recognition of the NTC as the sole legitimate governing body on Libya.\n\nIn March 2011, he hosted General Abdul Fatah Younis, former Interior Minister of Libya (under the Gaddafi government), turned leader of the rebel armed forces in the EU capital. Igtet facilitated dialogue between Younis and NATO during a critical time for the rebel movement which ultimately saw the NATO led 2011 military intervention in Libya to defend the Libyan people from Gaddafi forces.

{"id": "25027502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25027502", "title": "Bobby Schilling", "text": "Bobby Schilling\n\nRobert Todd Schilling (born January 23, 1964) is a former U.S. Representative for , serving from 2011 to 2013. Schilling is a member of the Republican Party. Schilling challenged incumbent Democrat Phil Hare in the 2010 election and defeated him by ten points. In the 2012 election, he was defeated by Democrat Cheri Bustos. In 2014, he ran for his former seat, but lost again to Bustos.\n\nSchilling was born and raised in Rock Island, Illinois. He graduated from Alleman Catholic High School and attended Black Hawk College.\n\nSchilling worked at Container Corporation of America between 1983 and 1987 and was a union steward for the local chapter of the United Paper Workers International Union. He then worked as an insurance agent for Prudential Insurance Company between 1987 and 1995, where he was ranked in the top 5% of all Prudential agents during his last year. He was also the treasurer for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union for four of those years.\n\nIn 1996, he and his wife opened Saint Giuseppe's Heavenly Pizza in Moline, Illinois; the restaurant is still owned by the family and Schilling ran the restaurant until taking office, when he left his son in charge. According to public personal financial disclosures, Schilling's restaurant has dropped in value from a range of $100,000 to $250,000 down to between $50,000–$100,000. Schilling's son and campaign manager Terry Schilling said, \"The real estate market has really taken a hit in East Moline. It just goes to show that Bobby Schilling has a real stake in this economy.\"\n\nSchilling grew up as a Democrat, but has become more conservative over the years and now characterizes himself as a \"Reagan Republican.\" He was also influenced by radio and television personality Glenn Beck. Schilling was one of the 9–12 Candidates, a group led by Beck, and signed the 9–12 contract of principles and values. Schilling has said he was inspired to run for office because he was preparing to franchise his restaurant, but cancelled his plans when he saw then-Presidential candidate Barack Obama telling Joe the Plumber that the government needed to \"spread the wealth around.\" Schilling announced his candidacy in April 2009 and officially filed for the Republican nomination in October 2009.\n\nSchilling vowed not to participate in the congressional pension program, to keep his private health insurance instead of the congressional plan, to donate any pay raises he receives, to limit himself to no more than eight years in Congress, and not to vote for any bill he hasn't read. \"I'm not going to make a career out of this,\" he says.\n\nEarly in the campaign, political websites rated the 17th District race \"safe Democratic.\" However, by Election Day the race was rated \"leans Republican\" by RealClearPolitics, Cook Political Report, CQ Politics, and \"The New York Times\". The race was profiled on CNN as one of the country's top 100 House races, in which they said, \"Schilling trails in the overall money race, but he's raised enough to get his message out and give the incumbent something to worry about.\"\n\nIn September 2010, Schilling was named to the National Republican Congressional Committee's \"Young Guns\" program.\n\nHare criticized Schilling for living 0.99 miles outside the 17th District, though the Constitution only requires congressmen to live in the state they wish to represent. Schilling's wife notes that the family's restaurant is in the 17th and employs people and pays taxes there. She also says the family fell out of the district because of gerrymandering.\n\nUnopposed in the primary election, in the general election, Schilling won by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 53 percent of the vote to Hare's 43 percent. Notably, he carried Hare's home county, Rock Island County, a normally heavily Democratic county that is home to the district's two largest cities, Moline and Rock Island, by nine points. After the election, Schilling hired as his chief of staff Mike Roman, a political consultant known for posting a video showing alleged voter intimidation during the 2008 presidential election. Roman, along with policy director Scott Tranter, resigned from Schilling's office in April 2011.\n\nSchilling's campaign set an off-year fundraising record for a challenger in the 17th district, amassing about $89,000 in 2009. Schilling's campaign fundraising relied largely on individual donors, who accounted for about 80 percent of the $1 million raised by his campaign. Hare depended more heavily on political action committees, who contributed about two-thirds of his campaigns $1.3 million total. Following his election, Schilling has relied more on political action committees to help retire his campaign debt, with the bulk of his December 2010 fundraising coming from PACs, including Wal-Mart, the American Medical Association, Caterpillar Inc. and Archer Daniels Midland Co.\n\nSchilling ended the campaign with a total of $1,095,167 raised and $1,078,911 spent.\n\nThe following organizations endorsed Schilling in his 2010 run for Congress: The Illinois Federation for the Right to Life PAC; CatholicVote PAC; the Quincy Tea Party group; John Deere PAC; and the United States Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIndividuals who endorsed Schilling included: U.S. Representative Aaron Schock (R-IL); U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN); former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney; political figure and author Joe the Plumber (Joe Wurzelbacher); and, Sgt. John F. Baker, Jr., recipient of the Medal of Honor.\n\nNewspapers were evenly divided in endorsing Schilling over Hare, with the \"Chicago Tribune\" and the \"Sauk Valley News\" among those supporting Schilling. In October 2010 Schilling was endorsed by the \"Chicago Tribune\".\n\nSchilling ran for re-election in 2012 and faced Democrat and former East Moline City Council Alderwoman Cheri Bustos in the general election. He has been added to the National Republican Congressional Committee's Patriot Program, which is designed to defend incumbent Republicans. Bustos received a significant assist from the 2010 round of redistricting. The 17th already had a modest Democratic lean, but the Democratic-controlled legislature redrew the district to make it even more Democratic. Notably, Quincy, Decatur and the district's share of Springfield were cut out, replaced by the more Democratic portions of Peoria and Rockford. National Journal's Cook Political Report named Schilling one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012.\n\nSchilling has raised $1.4 million and had $950,000 cash on hand as of June 30, 2011.\n\nWhile initially rated as a \"lean-Democrat\" race by major sites, in September 2012, \"Roll Call\", the Cook Political Report, and the Rothenburg Political Report upgraded the race to \"toss-up\", with Cook saying Schilling had an advantage.\n\nSchilling was endorsed by the \"Chicago Tribune\", the \"Rockford Register Star\", CatholicVote, the National Rifle Association, former Congressman Tom Railsback, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the \"Galesburg Register-Mail\", among other endorsements.\n\nIn the November 2012 elections, Bustos defeated Schilling by a 53%–47% margin. According to the Seattle Post Intelligencer, Schilling was \"looking forward to focusing again on his pizza business after losing a second term.\"\n\nIt was widely expected by political analysts that Schilling would challenge Bustos to reclaim the seat in 2014. On July 8, 2013, he officially announced his candidacy for his old seat in the 2014 election. In his announcement, he said Bustos has been failing the middle class, and criticized her for not supporting any budget plans in the legislature.\n\nAccording to \"The Hill\", Schilling \"historically has not been a strong fundraiser but is known as a skilled grassroots campaigner.\" During 2013, Bustos raised approximately $1.1 million and Schilling raised approximately $297,000.\n\nSchilling was endorsed by the \"Chicago Tribune\".\n\nSchilling was defeated in the November 4 general election by Bustos, 55%–45%.\n\nSchilling's wife and 10 children attended the congressional swearing-in on January 5, 2011, attracting some notice and an interview with Diane Sawyer. His early actions as a congressman included joining 25 other freshman Republicans in voting against extending the USA PATRIOT Act; Schilling stated he believed that the bill may not provide sufficient safeguards on who is allowed to access personal information, and that the 45 minutes allotted for floor debate was inadequate to discuss these concerns. Following Obama's late January 2011 State of the Union address in which the President said he was \"eager\" to work with critics of his health care reform law, Schilling sent a letter to Obama requesting a one-on-one meeting.\n\nIn February 2011, Schilling joined 130 House Republicans in voting against a $450 million budget cut for an extra F-35 fighter-jet engine—a project that the U.S. Department of Defense had repeatedly tried to kill, and that Defense Secretary Robert Gates called \"a waste of nearly 3 billion.\" Schilling voted for a package of cuts that included a $230 million federal grant to build an Amtrak line from Chicago to Iowa City, though he had supported the project during his campaign, calling it \"critically important to both the economy and the environment of the Midwest.\" The planned rail line was a celebrated project by many in his district, including local mayors. Schilling defended his vote, arguing it was a question of prioritizing, separating wants from needs, and when he looked at the big picture, the rail service did not make the cut. He also stated that his constituents elected him to address national debt and deficit problems in Washington, not to take a business-as-usual approach.\n\nIn June 2011, Schilling introduced a bill to prevent members of Congress from receiving their congressional pension before they reach the Social Security retirement age.\n\nDuring the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, Schilling voted to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nIn October 2011, a California resident issued a death threat promising a reward to anyone who assassinated Schilling. The threat is being investigated by the FBI and the United States Capitol Police. Schilling said he was advised by authorities to \"lay low\" while they investigated the threat and a spokeswoman for Schilling said the Schilling family was taking the \"recommended precautions\". According to \"The Hill\", the person behind the threat may be the one behind similar threats against George W. Bush, several high-ranking current and former security and defense officials, and Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado. Schilling said, \"It's a general threat to all members of Congress, but they specifically called my name out in the threat. You just don't know what people are thinking...It's something we're not going to take lightly.\"\n\nSchilling gave the Republican response to the President's weekly radio address on October 29, 2011.\n\nIn September 2012, Schilling was given the \"Friend of Agriculture Award\" by the Stephenson County Farm Bureau. In October 2012, he was given the \"No Labels Problem Solvers Seal\".\n\nSchilling was considered to be a tea party candidate in the 2010 election. He holds the following positions:\n\n\nSchilling is married to Christie Schilling. They have ten children, the youngest of whom was born in February 2010, and two grandchildren. Schilling currently works in the private sector for CMB Regional Centers of Rock Island as director of business relations and government affairs. CMB works with foreign investors interested in permanent residency and investment opportunities in the United States. His son is now managing Saint Giuseppe's Heavenly Pizza, but Schilling is still involved in running the business.\n\n"}

Though he had learned some swordfighting and bullfighting skills in Spain before his arrival in the United States, he was a poor fighter. In 1903, he suffered an attack of nerves before a fight in Mexico and failed to fight. In 1904, he was a key figure in the St. Louis bullfight riot, which led to the destruction of a 14,000-seat arena by fire. Three days after the riot, he shot and killed fellow matador Don Manuel Cervera after the other man attacked Bass with a knife over a dispute regarding the bullfight canceled by the riot. A subsequent coroner's inquest found Bass acted in self-defense and should not be charged with murder. Following his acquittal, Bass went on to star in several bloodless bullfights. These involved enraging the bull, causing it to charge and miss, but not spearing it or cutting it with a sword.\n"}

She received her undergraduate degree in historical geography from University College, London and a Masters in urban and cultural Geography from University of Nebraska at Lincoln. She returned to England to teach cartography at the University of Sheffield, and worked as urban planner at the Ministry of Housing and London County Council. She returned to the US and earned a second Masters in City and Regional Planning from the University of California at Berkeley in 1965. She participated in counter-culture movement in the 1960s at Berkeley, joining in the student strikes, and agitating for free speech. She was inspired by the writings of Catherine Bauer Wurster on housing programs and Jane Jacobs on urban place-making.\n\nMarcus worked for several years as a research associate in the Institute of Urban and Regional Development at the University of California at Berkeley and began teaching in the Department of Landscape Architecture in 1969. Her course on Social and Psychological Factors in Open Space Design was popular among undergraduate and graduate students alike. She held a joint appointment in the Department of Architecture where she taught seminars on social aspects of housing design, environments for the life cycle, and sense of place. She collaborated with many of her former students in writing articles and editing books.\n\nMarcus was married to the landscape architect Stephen Marcus with whom she has two children, Jason and Lucy. After having retired from full-time teaching in 1994, she writes, travels, and consults. She is the Principal of the firm Healing Landscapes specializing in healthcare settings and regularly teaches healthcare garden design at the Chicago Botanic Garden. She has received numerous awards, including for exemplary design research from the National Endowment for the Arts, career award from the Environmental Design Research Association (EDRA), and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Her co-edited (with Carolyn Francis) volume \"People Places: Design Guidelines for Urban Open Space\" received a Merit Award from the American Society of Landscape Architects in 2000 and \"Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations\" (co-edited with Marni Barnes) won the EDRA Award for Place Research in 2000.\n\nMarcus advocates post-occupancy evaluation as a research method for studying public and semi-public open spaces. In her studies of Easter Hill Village in Richmond, California and St. Francis Square in San Francisco, she saw that semi-public open spaces in cluster housing foster a sense of community. She found these spaces to be well-used by residents, particularly by children. Her articles and book (with Wendy Sarkissian) \"Housing as if People Mattered: Site Design Guidelines for Medium-Density Family Housing\" published by the University of California Press in 1986 showed how medium density, low-rise cluster housing is supportive of families with children and a catalyst in building social networks. Marcus expanded her studies on open spaces in housing to other types—neighborhood and city parks, plazas, and campus open spaces in her edited volume (with Carolyn Francis) \"People Places: Design Guidelines for Urban Open Space\" first published by Van Nostrand Reinhold in 1990. She translated her findings in performance guidelines that would aid the designer and bridge the gap between research and practice.\n\nThe formative years of Marcus' childhood were spent in Buckinghamshire countryside during World War II where her family was evacuated from London. There she was free to explore the landscape and developed a lifelong affinity for the natural outdoors. She encouraged her design students to remember their own childhood environments and write their environmental autobiography to discover hidden biases while designing for their clients.\n\nMarcus' work shows the impact of human potential movement in California in the 1960s. She attended seminars in the Carl Jung Institute in San Francisco and the Esalen Institute in Big Sur to delve deep into topics such as the age of Aquarius, sacred geometries in the landscape, self-transformation and becoming whole through integration of feminine and masculine archetypes. She wrote about the garden as a symbol of the higher self and the role of gardening in creating the spiritual community of Findhorn in Scotland. She adapted the Gestalt role playing therapeutic technique in her research on house as symbol of the self that was published as the book \"The House as a Mirror of Self: Exploring the Deeper Meaning of Home\" published by Conari Press in 1995. Marcus' own environmental autobiography and analysis of her self and growth are contained in \"Iona Dreaming: The Healing Power of Place\", \"A Memoir\" published by Nicholas-Hays, Inc. in 2010. In this book written after a double bout with cancer, she reveals the remarkable power of place to heal psychological wounds and restore the spirit.\n\nMarcus has continued her research on restorative environments in the book (with Marni Barnes) \"Gardens in Healthcare Facilities: Uses, Therapeutic Benefits, and Design Recommendations\" published by The Center for Health Design, Inc. (Martinez, California) in 1995; in the edited volume (with Marni Barnes) \"Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations\" published by John Wiley & Sons in 1999; and the book (with Naomi Sachs) \"Therapeutic Landscapes: An Evidence-Based Approach to Designing Healing Gardens and Restorative Outdoor Spaces\" published by John Wiley & Sons in 2014.

Olson\n\nFloyd Bjørnstjerne Olson (November 13, 1891 – August 22, 1936) was an American politician and lawyer. He served as the 22nd Governor of Minnesota from January 6, 1931, to August 22, 1936, dying in office of stomach cancer. Olson was a member of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party, and the first member of that party to win the office of governor. He is consistently considered one of the greatest governors in Minnesota history and one of the most influential American politicians of his era.\n\nFloyd B. Olson was born on the north side of Minneapolis, Minnesota, the only child of a Norwegian father and a Swedish mother. The North Side neighborhood where Olson grew up was the home of a sizable Orthodox Jewish community, and Olson's friendships with some of the local Jewish families led him to serve as a shabbos goy, assisting Jews on the Sabbath by performing actions they were not permitted to do. Olson picked up Yiddish from his childhood associations with his Jewish neighbors and years later spoke the language fluently while campaigning in Jewish communities, in addition to having several Jews serve him in advisory roles while in elected office.\n\nAfter graduating from North High School in Minneapolis in 1909, Olson went to work for the Northern Pacific Railway. The next year, he enrolled at the University of Minnesota, but he left after only a year, during which he was always in trouble for wearing a derby in violation of school rules and for refusing to participate in required ROTC drills.\n\nHeading west, Olson worked a series of odd jobs in Canada and Alaska before settling briefly in Seattle, Washington, where he became a stevedore and joined the Industrial Workers of the World. During this time, Olson read widely and began to adopt a populist, semi-socialist philosophy he would retain for the rest of his life.\n\nReturning to Minnesota in 1913, Olson enrolled at William Mitchell College of Law (then the Northwestern College of Law), earning his degree in 1915. That same year, he met and married Ada Krejci in New Prague, Minnesota and became a practicing lawyer.\n\nIn 1919, Olson was hired as an Assistant Hennepin County Attorney and by the following year had himself become the Hennepin County Attorney after his former boss was fired for accepting bribes.\n\nDuring that period, he made his first foray into politics when he helped form the Committee of 48, an organization that attempted to draft Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. to run for president on a third-party ticket. The effort proved unsuccessful, but La Follette would later run on the Progressive Party ticket in 1924. That same year, Olson ran in the Democratic primary for the local seat in the House of Representatives but lost.\n\nAs Hennepin County Attorney, Olson quickly earned a name for himself as a stern prosecutor who relished going after crooked businessmen. He took on the Ku Klux Klan in a well-publicized case that brought both respect and death threats and was reelected to the position in 1922 and 1926.\n\nIn 1923, Olson brought a case against the leaders of the Minnesota Citizens Alliance, a conservative business organization dedicated to preserving right-to-work laws, after they hired a hitman to dynamite the home of a union leader. Olson's vigorous pursuit of the Citizens Alliance made him a hero to the local labor movement, which encouraged him to run for the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party's gubernatorial nomination in 1924.\n\nHaving secured the endorsement of the Hennepin County Farmer-Labor Central Committee, Olson narrowly won the nomination in a bitterly fought primary. Buoyed by La Follette's presidential campaign (La Follette endorsed Olson and vice versa), he received 43% of the vote to Republican candidate Theodore Christianson's 48%. Democratic candidate Carlos Avery came in a distant third with 6%.\n\nFour years later, in 1928, the new \"Farmer-Labor Association\" (which had changed its name to avoid being linked with local communists) attempted to draft Olson to run for governor again. Although the party committee once again endorsed him and this time guaranteed that he would not face a primary battle, Olson declined to run. In the U.S. presidential election, 1928, the Farmer-Labor candidate lost in the Republican landslide that accompanied Herbert Hoover's election.\n\nBy 1930, however, the stock market had crashed, and the Great Depression had begun. After the party's newspaper urged that Olson be drafted, he easily won the nomination. Forming a coalition of farmers, organized labor, and small businessmen, Olson swept to a landslide victory in the election, receiving 59% of the vote in a four-way race and winning 82 of the state's 87 counties.\n\nAt the time Olson assumed his office, Minnesota's legislature was officially nonpartisan but was in reality dominated by conservative Republicans who opposed most of what Olson stood for.\n\nNevertheless, Olson soon proved himself skilled at the art of politics and managed to fulfill the vast majority of his campaign promises. During his three terms as governor, Olson proposed, and the legislature passed, bills that instituted a progressive income tax, created a social security program for the elderly, expanded the state's environmental conservation programs, guaranteed equal pay for women and the right to collective bargaining, and instituted a minimum wage and a system of unemployment insurance.\n\nDespite these changes, the thing Olson wanted the most, a bill that would have put Minnesota's electric utilities, iron mines, oil fields, grain elevators, and meatpacking plants under state ownership, never saw the light of day, as the legislature balked at what they saw as socialism and Olson insisted was \"cooperativism.\"\n\nAs the platform of his party grew successively more radical, Olson's support amongst the middle class gradually began to erode. His vigorous support from labor and agriculture, however, remained undiminished and he was easily reelected in 1932 and 1934.\n\nIn its April 24, 1933, issue, \"Time\" magazine quoted Olson speaking from the steps of the state capitol:\n\n\"I am making a last appeal to the Legislature. If the Senate does not make provision for the sufferers in the State and the Federal Government refuses to aid, I shall invoke the powers I hold and shall declare martial law. ... A lot of people who are now fighting [relief] measures because they happen to possess considerable wealth will be brought in by provost guard and be obliged to give up more than they would now. There is not going to be misery in this State if I can humanly prevent it. . . Unless the Federal and State governments act to insure against recurrence of the present situation, I hope the present system of government goes right down to hell.\"\nOn May 16, 1934, the trucker's union in Minneapolis started a strike (Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934) that quickly resulted in open violence. The violence ebbed and flowed for the next two months until Governor Olson declared martial law on July 26, and mobilized 4,000 National Guardsmen under the command of Adjutant General Ellard A. Walsh. Walsh used a combination of checkpoints, security patrols, and curfews to restore order. As the violence subsided, negotiations resumed, and an agreement was reached to end the labor dispute.\n\nDespite considerable achievements and widespread support, Olson's administration was marred by allegations made by crusading newspaper editor Walter Liggett that there were links between some members of his administration and organized crime. No evidence ever implicated Olson personally, however. Liggett was gunned down in front of his family in 1935. Kid Cann, a Minnesota gangster, was charged with but not convicted of the killing.\n\nIn 1935, Olson ruled out the possibility of running for President in the 1936 election, as a third-party candidate. Instead, on November 18, 1935, he announced his intention to run against longtime incumbent Thomas Schall for one of Minnesota's U.S. Senate seats. His chances improved the next month when Senator Schall died in office following a road accident, and Elmer Benson, the interim successor to Schall chosen by Olson, promised not to run for the seat in the 1936 election.\n\nHowever, Olson's own health was beginning to fail. Having suffered from severe ulcers ever since his election, Olson went to the Mayo Clinic in December 1935 and was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Although the cancer would eventually prove fatal, Olson was not told of the seriousness of his condition, as was the practice of the day.\n\nThus reassured of his \"good health,\" Olson proceeded to further weaken himself by not only resuming his duties as governor but also beginning to organize his party's state convention and returning to his senatorial campaign. As he stumped across the state, promising to support federal ownership of monopolies, he further weakened his immune system, allowing his cancer to metastasize.\n\nOlson last made a public appearance on June 29, 1936, giving a stump speech in Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis. The next day, he returned to the Mayo Clinic for treatment, but it was too late. He died there on August 22 at the age of 44.\n\nSince his death, dozens of statues of Olson have been constructed throughout the state, many of which declare him to be the state's \"greatest governor.\"\n\nShortly after Olson died, Minnesota State Highway 55 (a highway that was then being constructed) was renamed the \"Floyd B. Olson Memorial Highway\" in his honor. A proposal by the Taxpayers League in late 2004 to rename the highway after the recently deceased President Ronald Reagan met with widespread public condemnation and was soon abandoned.\n\nIn 1974, Olson's home at 1914 West 49th Street in Minneapolis was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In contrast to his older brother Alaa, Gamal had pursued an active public profile and was starting to wield some influence on political life in the country before the revolution of early 2011.\n\nPrior to the revolution, Gamal was deputy secretary-general of the then-ruling and now-dissolved National Democratic Party, and head of its influential policies committee.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, he was convicted of political corruption for diverting nearly $20 million in state funds to private use, along with his father and brother, and sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nWithin the family, under his half-British mother, his name is 'Jimmy', while his brother Alaa is 'Alan'.\n\nMubarak's given name, Gamal, comes from Egypt's second president, Gamal Abdel Nasser. For his early education, he attended St. George's College, Cairo before entering the American University in Cairo. He graduated with a business administration degree and he claims he also earned an MBA from the university. He began his professional career working for Bank of America. \nMubarak left Bank of America to set up London-based Medinvest Associates Ltd, which manages a private equity fund, and to do some corporate finance consultancy work. His role with Medinvest has since ended.\n\nIn May 2007, Mubarak married Khadiga El Gammal, the daughter of Egyptian construction magnate Mahmoud El Gammal. They have a daughter, Farida (born 2010).\n\nThe grooming of Gamal Mubarak to be his father's successor as the next president of Egypt became increasingly evident at around 2000. With no vice-president, and with no heir-apparent in sight, Gamal started enjoying considerable attention in Egyptian state-run media. On 3 February 2000 Hosni Mubarak appointed him to the General Secretariat of the ruling National Democratic Party. Bashar al-Assad's rise to power in Syria in June 2000 just hours after Hafez al-Assad's death, sparked a heated debate in the Egyptian press regarding the prospects for a similar scenario occurring in Cairo.\n\nMubarak founded, and became chairman of, the Future Generation Foundation (FGF), an NGO supporting job training but which also served as a vehicle for Mubarak's political career.\n\nBoth President Mubarak and his son denied the possibility of any inheritance of power in Egypt. More recently, this claim was made in early 2006, when Gamal Mubarak declared repeatedly that he had no aspiration to succeed his father, but that he would maintain his position in the then-ruling NDP as deputy secretary general, a post he held in addition to heading the party's policy committee, allegedly the most important organ of the NDP.\n\nIn September 2004, several political groups (most are unofficial), on both the left and the right, announced their sharp opposition to the inheritance of power. They demanded political change and a fair, multi-candidate election.\n\nOn 26 February 2005, Mubarak ordered the constitution changed to allow multi-candidate presidential elections before September 2005 by asking parliament to amend Article 76 of the Egyptian constitution. This change in the constitution was seen then by some analysts and senior judicial figures as a ploy to seamlessly allow Gamal Mubarak to inherit the top position in Egypt. According to this view, Gamal Mubarak would be one of the candidates in a presidential elections and would be supported by the ruling party and the government-controlled media. Since remaining serious candidates would be disqualified by the NDP-controlled People's Assembly leaving only the less popular candidates, the inheritance of power would be accomplished through a \"democratic\" process. However these were all merely assumptions made by political activists, analysts, and opponents.\n\nSome political analysts speculate that the alleged deteriorating state of the Egyptian economy in the last days of Hosni Mubarak's rule was caused by Gamal and his friends taking over as political advisers to Mubarak. On the other hand, a wide range of analysts credit Gamal Mubarak for reviving the Egyptian economy over the previous five years, from a stagnant, mostly state-run economy to a largely free market system that enjoyed five percent GDP growth.\n\nDuring the first week of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution there were unconfirmed reports and speculation that Gamal might have left Egypt during the protests. However, on 3 February 2011, Gamal was present for an ABC News interview of his father in Cairo.\n\nAs the 2011 Egyptian revolution unfolded, newly appointed vice president Omar Suleiman met a major public concern when he announced on 3 February 2011 that Gamal Mubarak would not seek election.\n\nReuters Africa reported that a fight took place between him and his older brother, Alaa Mubarak. Alaa supposedly accused Gamal of ruining their father's last days in power and humiliating him.\n\nFollowing the stepping down of Hosni Mubarak, media sources started to point to the 'suspicious' financial dealings of Gamal Mubarak. On 28 February 2011, the Egyptian daily \"Al-Ahram\" published a list of bank accounts allegedly belonging to Gamal Mubarak. \"Al-Ahram\" reported that the Chief Prosecutor of Egypt received a report that Gamal Mubarak inexplicably amassed significant sums of money that were deposited in these accounts. This allegation came on background of a decision from the Prosecutor General of Egypt to freeze all bank accounts belonging to the Mubarak family, including Gamal Mubarak. The Egyptian Appeals Court ordered that Mubarak's financial status is reviewed by the court on 5 March 2011. It is expected that the court will render a decision in that hearing whether to uphold the decision to freeze Mubarak's assets.\n\nOn 13 April 2011, Gamal was imprisoned for 15 days pending investigations for corruption, abuse of power, and for his alleged role in causing the fatalities and casualties of peaceful protesters during the revolution which was sparked on 25 January 2011. An official investigation accused Gamal Mubarak of using his influence in the National Democratic Party and as son of the president to award contracts to foreign companies in which he was a partner. He appeared in court, alongside his father and brother. Gamal, his brother is still currently in prison. Whereas his father has been released from jail but put on house arrest for 15 days.\n\nOn 19 December 2013, Gamal was once again freed after he was acquitted of corruption along with his brother and Ahmed Shafik, ex-candidate of Egyptian presidential election, 2012.\n\nOn 21 May 2014, a Cairo court convicted Mubarak and his sons Alaa and Gamal of embezzling the equivalent of of state funds intended for renovation of presidential palaces but were instead diverted to upgrade private family homes. The court ordered the repayment of , fined the trio , and sentenced Mubarak to three years in prison and each of his sons to four years. They were retried and convicted again in May 2015. In October 2015 he and his brother were released from prison, based on time already served.\n\nIn September 2018, Gamal was arrested along with his brother Alaa and accused of stock market manipulation.\n\n"}
{"id": "19403675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19403675", "title": "Guyanese people", "text": "Guyanese people\n\nGuyanese people are people identified with the country of Guyana, which is located on the northern coast of South America and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, Brazil, Venezuela and Surinam. Geographically, Guyana is part of the South American mainland, however it is much more similar to the nearby island nations of the Caribbean such as Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada with respect to culture. In fact, Guyana is considered a Caribbean country even though it is not an island nation located in the Caribbean Sea, as are most Caribbean nations.\n\nGuyana is also a founding member of the Caribbean Community CARICOM; however, it shares some of the Latin American customs and traits that are characteristic of its South American neighbours and is also a founding member of the Union of South American Nations which was formed in 2008. In addition to some Latin American and a great deal of Caribbean influence, Guyana's culture also reflects its European history as it was colonized by both the Dutch and French before becoming a British colony. As a matter of fact, the capital city of the country, Georgetown, was previously called Longchamps and Stabroek under the French and Dutch respectively. Additionally, numerous Guyanese towns and villages have French and Dutch names which reflect the periods during which the country was colonized by the French and Dutch. As would be expected, the pronunciations of the names of those towns and villages are anglicized. Guyana (known as British Guiana under British colonial rule), gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1966 and subsequently became a republic in 1970. As a result of Guyana's long, 170-year history as a British colony, it is a part of the Anglophone world. Since the country is more culturally Caribbean than it is South American, it is considered to be a part of the Anglephone Caribbean - a subregion of the Caribbean consisting of independent, English-speaking nations that were once British colonies (also known as the Commonwealth Caribbean). Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America; however, the majority of people in Guyana actually speak Creolese informally. Creolese is a creole language that is largely based on English infrequently interspersed with anglicized French words. Standard English, i.e. British English spelling and pronunciation, is used for all business and education and is typically consistently spoken by members of the upper and upper-middle class.\n\nGuyana is a diverse nation; 39.8% of the population is of East Indian origin (see Indo-Guyanese), 30% Black African (see Afro-Guyanese), 19.9% multiracial (almost all part African), 10.5% Amerindian and 0.5% other, mostly Chinese and whites (most notably Portuguese). The terms «Indo-Guyanese» and «Afro-Guyanese » seem to have only become a part of the Guyanese vernacular within the last 20 years or so. Creolese (Guyanese Creole) is the most common language amongst Guyanese while British English is taught in School, and used in Government and business. Guyanese tend to be quite adept at code-switching, using either Creolese or British English when appropriate. The religious breakdown of Guyanese people is: Hindu 28.4%, Pentecostal 16.9%, Roman Catholic 8.1%, Muslim 7.2%, Anglican 6.9%,\nSeventh-day Adventist 5%, other Christian denominations 20.5%, no religion 4.3%, Rastafarian 0.5%, Bahá'í 0.1%, other faiths 2.2%.\n\nOverseas Guyanese communities mainly exist in the United States (86,120 Guyanese born), United Kingdom (20,872 Guyanese born), Canada (14,560 Guyanese born), and the Netherlands (328 Guyanese born), although the total populations (i.e. people of Guyanese descent born in that country) are much higher.\n\nThe migration of Guyanese to other countries began in the late 1950s when some Guyanese (mainly young men, and some women) took up offers from the British Government to migrate to England to supplement the British labour force, like other Caribbean countries. This was a short lived policy as the British government quickly closed the doors on open immigration from its Caribbean Territories. The migration of many Guyanese Portuguese to the U.K and Canada happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s due to political struggles and problems at the time.\n\nThe migration of Guyanese to other Western countries, mostly Canada and the United States, continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, much of it due to political and economic problems. Discontent with the Forbes Burnham government, misguided economic policies, and shortages of basic items let to large-scale emigration during the 1980s. While many left due to political, economic, and social problems, those who could afford it left looking for better opportunities and some for educational purposes. The 1990s saw migration to other Caribbean countries. Migration continued by the need to reconnect split families. The migration of Guyanese to other lands continues today.\n\n\n"}

His mother, Kattarina Ossenbach, died in the plague, and he had a brother, Bernhardus von Staden, a Roman Catholic priest in Ahlen, and a sister. When attending a Catholic seminary in Ahlen, Staden was accused of stabbing a fellow seminarian with an awl. His cousin, Steffan Hovener, invited him to live in Livonia with him, where \"he would not be disturbed.\" In Livonia, he worked on building the city walls, but didn't like the labor and ran away to the Wolgarten estate in Wolmar, Valmiera. There, the wife of Wolgarten entrusted him with her estates when she learned he could read and write in Latin and German, and was learning Latvian.\n\nAfter Wolgarten remarried and moved away, Staden also moved, to Karkus, and became a merchant. After trouble erupted in the Livonian government, Staden sent a letter to his friend, Joachim Schroter at the border town of Dorpat, which was held by the Russians. He wrote that he would serve the Grand Prince Ivan IV if he were paid. He was invited to Moscow, where he met the Grand Prince. Ivan was impressed with Staden and invited him to dinner; soon after, he became a member of the Tsar's political police, or Oprichnina.\n\nStaden's account of Russia, \"The Land and Government of Muscovy\", was addressed to the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II. It consisted of four parts: a petition, a description of Russia, a plan for the invasion of Russia from the north, and the author's autobiography. Staden hoped to influence the emperor to invade Muscovite Russia, restore the region to the Teutonic Order, and be rewarded. The Elector of the Palatinate, Georg Hans Count von Veldenz-Lutzelstein, had similar hopes and took Staden into his employment. Between 1578 and 1582 Staden worked as a sort of spy for the Teutonic Order. He sent his proposal to the Order's Grand Master, and later to the Kings of Poland and Sweden.\n\nHistorians discovered this document in 1839 in the Prussian state archives, knowing of the count's plans, but no link to Staden was discovered until a few years later. His accounts are the most insightful and descriptive of the day, and displayed the disorder of the Russian government under Ivan the Terrible. Heinrich von Staden calls Tsar Ivan a \"horrid tryant\", but wrote more neutrally than his contemporaries. His narratives of the Oprichnina are the only ones written by a member, and the history of the Oprichnina was rewritten after Staden's accounts were found. He describes the targets of Ivan's terror as individual families which the Tsar believed to be dangerous to his authority, rather than against the entire boyar class as previously thought.\n\nSome historians question the authenticity of Staden's claims. Academician was very critical of the \"Notes on Muscovy\". The historian , comparing Staden's text with the historical realities of the epoch and with the newly discovered documents, came to the conclusion that Staden was not in Oprichnina at all, but only pretended to be oprichnik, in order to raise his status in the eyes of Emperor Rudolph, his patron and addressee of notes on Muscovy. According to Alshits, many of Staden's reports on Ivan the Terrible's Rus resemble the stories of Munchausen.\n\n"}

His first book of poetry, with an introduction by eminent poet Mehdi Hamidi Shirazi, was published when he was 19 years old. During Iran's open period following World War II, Sayeh got involved in various literary circles and contributed to various literary magazines such as Sokhan, Kavian, Sadaf, Maslehat, and others. Unlike many other literary figures of the time who got deeply involved in politics and left-leaning activities, Sayeh stayed true to his social and political consciousness but refrained from deeper involvement.

Later he was invited by the national Iranian Radio to produce the traditional music program \"Golhaye Taze\" and \"Golchin Hafte.\"\n\nAfter the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the ensuing suppression, Sayeh spent a year in prison for his writings.

In 1987, he moved to Cologne, Germany, with his family and lives there.\n\nSayeh published his first collection of poetry while he was still a high school student in the northern province of Gilan, Iran.

His own early poetry reveals his concern with purposive literature.\n\nSayeh has also written a collection of lyrical poems (ghazal) in the classical style. Here, he reveals an easy mastery of traditional forms—the lyrical ode, in particular—which he uses to celebrate both the sacred and the secular moments of life.

A month earlier, she had returned to her parents' house from her home in the Virgin Islands because of their age and deteriorating health. Hagen, a woman of considerable means, had previously cut short a medical career in urology in 1987 to move to the Virgin Islands to operate an inn with her second husband.\n\nRaised in Chatham Township, Hagen graduated from Chatham High School in 1963.\n\nA 1973 graduate of the Harvard Medical School, she became the first woman appointed a resident in urology at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was appointed chief of urology at the Rutgers Medical School in New Jersey in 1982.\n\nThe defense argued for an insanity plea. A defense psychiatrist, Robert L. Sadoff, stated that soon after Hagen returned to her home on Fairmount Avenue, Chatham New Jersey. She had chronic depression deepened because of the two failed marriages, the loss of her medical career, her fears about her parents' health, and her own fears that her depression would lead to institutionalization.\n\nBoth Sadoff and Dr. Steven Simring, who testified for the prosecution, said Hagen's depression deepened significantly in August 2000, to the point where she thought she was receiving messages from televisions ads, traffic lights and playing cards. They both also said she also heard a male voice she took to be her father's commanding her to commit the murders, because once they occurred, she and her parents would go to what Simring called a \"childlike, magical sphere where they'd regain their happiness.\"\n\nDeborah Factor, an assistant Morris County prosecutor, asked the psychiatrists if they considered the patricide-matricide acts of vindictiveness or mercy killings, and they both answered no.\n\nA New Jersey judge acquitted Hagen of charges after two psychiatrists testified that she was psychotic at the time.\n\nAfter the psychiatrists agreed that Hagen had been depressed for years, was delusional during the murders and was now suicidal, Judge B. Theodore Bozonelis found her not guilty on grounds of insanity and committed her to a state mental health institution.\n\nJudge Bozonelis did not order a specific term of confinement, but said he believed that she required long-term treatment in an institution because she is prone to unpredictable bouts of psychosis and is a danger to herself and society. Under the law, he said, Hagen was entitled to periodic hearings and reviews about her recovery and continued confinement.\n\nHagen died, aged 69, on April 18, 2015, at her home. She was cremated.\n"}

In 2015 and 2017, 2 kanji in total were added to the jinmeiyō list, making the total number 863.\n\nIn Japan, name kanji are taught at the junior-high level, and mastery of the name kanji is required to achieve Level 2 of the Kanji kentei, a Chinese-character proficiency test.\n\nBelow is a list of changes made to the jinmeiyō kanji list since its creation in 1951.\n\nFirst 92 characters of jinmeiyō kanji were published:\n\nSeven of them were later transferred to the jōyō kanji: , the last one being simplified to (dragon).\n\n28 kanji were added, for a total of 120 characters.\n\nOne was later transferred to the jōyō kanji: .\n\nIntroduction of the jōyō kanji list, which includes the 8 characters mentioned above; those 8 are thus deleted from the jinmeyō kanji list.\n54 other characters are added for a total of 166 name characters.\n\n118 kanji were added for a total of 284 characters.\n\n1 kanji was added, for a total of 285 characters.\n\n1 kanji was added, for a total of 286 characters.\n\n1 kanji was added, for a total of 287 characters.\n\nNo addition to the jinmeiyō kanji was made on this date. However, a plan for 578 additions was put forward to the council on jinmeiyō kanji of the legislative council of the Ministry of Justice. The list included certain characters in strong demand by parents for use in their children's names, such as:\n\nMany others were included not for their potential uses in names (as is noted), but rather because of their frequent use and being easy to read and write. Examples include:\n\n\nAt this same council, the decision was made to call for suggestions on characters to be included or excluded via the Ministry of Justice website, until July 9, 2004.\n\n3 kanji were added, for a total of 290 characters.\n\nNo additions were made. After sharp protests, the council decided to withdraw nine characters from the 489 whose inclusion had been discussed. These nine characters were:\n\nThe 480 other characters still remained under consideration for inclusion, with one additional character added to them, namely (\"kiku\", \"to draw up water with one's hands\").\n\n484 characters and variant forms of 209 jōyō kanji were added, bringing the total number of the jinmeiyō kanji to 983.\n\n2 more characters for a total number of 985 characters.\n\nIn late 2010, the Japanese government added 196 characters to the jōyō kanji list. The list now includes 129 characters previously classified as jinmeiyō kanji, 11 of which are currently used in Japanese prefectures or nearby countries:\n\n\nAt the same time, 5 characters deleted from the jōyō kanji list were added to the jinmeiyō kanji list, making the total number of jinmeiyō kanji 861:\n\n1 kanji was added, for a total of 862 characters.\n\n1 kanji was added, for a total of 863 characters.\n\nThe list is split into two parts: \n\nVariants are given in brackets.\n\nThe 18 characters which have a variant included in the list are:\n\nThe modern form (\"shinjitai\"), which appears in the Jōyō Kanji List, is given in brackets.\n\nUsage of the Jinmeiyō Kanji in Japanese names varies widely. For example, 之, is used in over 6000 names, and the 53 kanji used most commonly in names are all in over 500 names each.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8639242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8639242", "title": "Kallen Stadtfeld", "text": "Kallen Stadtfeld\n\nKallen Stadtfeld is half-Britannian, half-Japanese, but believes herself to be a Japanese person at heart and prefers to be known by her mother's maiden name, Kouzuki. Her father is Britannian and her mother is an Eleven; her father comes from a prestigious Britannian family, which Kallen benefits from. She attends the Ashford Academy, where she later becomes a member of its student council and is one of its most outstanding students. Her brother, , with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.\n\nBoth Kallen's stepmother, a Britannian, and biological mother live with her in the same house, but her biological mother is employed as a maid and is often mistreated by both her stepmother and Kallen herself. After her biological mother is arrested for using Refrain (a fictional drug which lets people think they're reliving the past), Kallen changes her views and decides to fight against the Britannian Empire not only for her brother, but to fulfill her new wish for a world in which she can live happily with her biological mother.\n\nKallen leads a double life as a normal Britannian student and as a member of a guerrilla resistance group against Britannia, which is later reformed into the Order of the Black Knights by Lelouch Lamperouge. In school, she portrays herself as a weak-bodied high school student who obeys all of the formalities, and goes by her Britannian name of Stadtfeld. However, her personality changes into a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.\n\nAs a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she accidentally pulls back a shower curtain in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kamine Island, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would've gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).\n\nIn an interview reported by the anime magazine Newtype USA, seiyu Ami Koshimizu talked about the difficulty of voicing Kallen because of the double life that her character leads. Certain aspects of Kallen's character such as her girlish naivete and competitiveness made it easy for the voice actress to relate, even to the point of admitting that in some ways they act very much the same.\n\nKallen appears early in the first episode, driving a truck with C.C.'s capsule, and then providing cover by fighting Jeremiah in a \"Glasgow\". After Lelouch gains his Geass from C.C., he takes control of an enemy \"Sutherland\" and helps Kallen to escape the other Knightmare Frames chasing her. He further directs the remaining resistance forces in the battle, granting them a decisive advantage until Suzaku Kururugi uses the \"Lancelot\"'s superior systems to overwhelm their forces. She sacrifices her own machine to allow Lelouch to escape, despite not knowing who he really is.\n\nAfter this incident, Lelouch's unfamiliarity with his Geass causes him to reveal knowledge of the Shinjuku incident to Kallen while questioning her about her motivations, leading her to suspect him of being their unknown benefactor. Lelouch disproves these suspicions by being present while she receives a telephone call from Zero, which actually plays a message he recorded. With the formation of the Black Knights and Zero's increasing number of victories over the Britannian forces, Kallen comes to greatly admire him, evident in her ecstatic reaction to her appointment as head of his personal guard. She even tries to assassinate Suzaku Kururugi after learning that he is the pilot of the \"Lancelot\", believing it would benefit Zero's goal. The trust seems to be mutual, as Lelouch offers to reveal his identity to her when he notices her curiosity; she declines, though she shows signs of jealousy that C.C., whom she had first met in the previous episode, appears to know.\nOnce the Black Knights begin receiving new Knightmares, Zero gives Kallen the newly developed \"Guren\" Mk-II. With its powerful radiation-emitting arm and speed matching that of Suzaku's \"Lancelot\", Kallen becomes one of the Black Knights' most talented pilots, often facing off against Suzaku and usually proving an even match for him.\n\nAt the end of the first season, Kallen reveals her identity to the students of Ashford Academy when the Black Knights occupy it as their base of operations, convincing the student council that they will not be harmed. Later on, she battles against Suzaku in his flight-equipped \"Lancelot\", suffering a narrow defeat. Lelouch intervenes before Suzaku can deliver the finishing blow. When Lelouch abandons the battle to rescue his sister, Kallen follows him. She witnesses his confrontation with Suzaku and learns about his true identity, the truth about the massacre of SAZ, and his Geass power. She flees in shock rather than helping Lelouch to deal with Suzaku, and goes into hiding. In \"Oz the Reflection\", she briefly helps Orpheus Zevon in battle before rejoining the Black Knights.\n\nOne year later, Kallen is still part of the Black Knights. Along with C.C., she is the only member who knows Lelouch's identity and secret power, having been brought up to speed by C.C. in the interim. Kallen confronts Lelouch about whether or not he used Geass to make her loyal to him, and Lelouch insists that her loyalty is her own decision. She seems to accept this, and still supports Zero, even though she prefers to see Lelouch and Zero as separate entities; however, she later starts seeing them as the same person. Over time Kallen grows to love Lelouch, offering to die for him. She also desires to be in his inner circle as C.C. is, so that she won't be left in the dark about his plans; though she won't admit it, C.C. easily sees through the act and playfully teases her about it, with Kallen unaware that Lelouch is slowly returning her feelings.\n\nDuring the operation to kidnap Nunnally vi Britannia as she is being transported to Area 11, Kallen receives an upgrade for the \"Guren\" Mk-II, giving it flight capabilities and an upgraded radiation arm. With it she is able to destroy Gilbert G.P. Guilford's \"Vincent\" and the remaining two Glaston Knights flanking him, then incapacitate Gino and Anya's Knightmare Frames with a wide-range burst. Her battle with Suzaku is cut short when the airship carrying Nunnally crashes into the sea.\n\nAfter this incident, Lelouch becomes depressed over Nunnally's involvement, since he can't bring himself to go against her wishes. When he nearly resorts to taking Refrain, Kallen steps in and talks him out of it, promising to do anything he asks her to. He tries to kiss her, requesting her to comfort him as a woman, but despite her feelings for him she backs out at the last moment and slaps him, insisting that he bears the responsibility for realizing the dream he gave the Japanese people. After Lelouch regains his composure and tricks the Britannians into exiling the Black Knights, she shows a great deal of relief knowing that he's feeling better. While she is daydreaming about this, Lelouch snaps her back to reality, causing her to fall on him. As she tries to cherish the moment by asking him why he came back, he counter-asks her if she will return to Ashford with him when Britannia is defeated, only to be interrupted by C.C.\n\nDuring the Black Knights attempted kidnapping of Empress Tianzi, Kallen is captured by Li Xingke in his \"Shen Hu\", having taken her \"Guren\" into battle without replacing its energy filler. After the High Eunuchs turn to Schneizel el Britannia for military support, she is turned over to Suzaku along with the \"Guren\". She is sent back to a prison in Area 11, and subsequently transferred into a more comfortable solitary cell by Nunnally, who also gives her a dress to wear. Suzaku approaches her after Shirley's death, intending to use the Refrain drug to find out if Lelouch has become Zero once again, but cannot bring himself to do it because he refuses to stoop to Lelouch's level. In retaliation, she beats him severely during their next meeting when Suzaku tries to apologize.\nDuring the second battle of Tokyo, Kallen is rescued from captivity and returned to the \"Guren\" (complete with a pilot suit brought by Sayoko), which had been radically upgraded by Lloyd Asplund and Cécile Croomy during her imprisonment. Using the new \"Guren\", she annihilates the Britannian forces. Luciano Bradley and the Valkyrie squadron are killed, as are an untold number of support units. She then fights Suzaku, easily breaking through his defenses and bringing him to the brink of death. In doing so, however, she activates his Geass command, forcing him to survive by firing the \"F.L.E.I.J.A.\" bomb. She dodges it and the bomb hits the government building, destroying a fair portion of the Tokyo Settlement.\n\nAfter Kallen returns to the Black Knights, she learns of C.C.'s memory loss and realizes that Lelouch is alone. When Zero's identity is revealed, she tries to defend him. The others won't listen, suspecting that Lelouch is controlling her. She asks Lelouch what she means to him, expressing a willingness to die with him. Seeing no way out, Lelouch mocks the Black Knights for taking so long to realize the truth, then calls Kallen a pawn. As Kallen walks away feeling betrayed, he whispers \"Kallen, you must live on\" within earshot. She unsuccessfully tries to get the Black Knights to wait after their first attempt to kill Zero fails thanks to Rolo Lamperouge, and is left standing on the hangar floor when Rolo uses his Geass to escape with Lelouch. After Lelouch's escape, Kallen tries to protest how Ohgi and the others have discarded Zero so readily despite all that he has done for them, but they refuse to listen, still angered at the idea that they were merely being used as pawns. When Lelouch is crowned Emperor, Kallen and the rest of the Black Knights are visibly stunned.\n\nFollowing Lelouch's declaration that Britannia will join the U.F.N., Kallen escorts him to the meeting, giving orders to the Black Knights beforehand to gun her down if she appears to be under the influence of Geass. Lelouch gets her to take the long route, giving them the chance to speak in private. Kallen recounts their history, and then asks Lelouch what he intends to gain by becoming Emperor, as well as what she means to him. Lelouch remains silent, so she kisses him. When he still doesn't respond, she bids him farewell; he does the same once she can no longer hear him.\n\nWhen Lelouch takes the U.F.N. leaders hostage, Kallen insists that she'll take Lelouch down personally, as she possesses the only Knightmare capable of fighting Suzaku's \"Lancelot Albion\". However, Xingke orders her not to fight, fearing for the safety of the hostages. After the Black Knights side with Schneizel, Kallen is stationed in the front lines. She breaks away from the main line to try to reach Lelouch, but is called back. Kallen breaks into the \"Avalon\" and attempts to kill Lelouch, with tears in her eyes as she does so, but is stopped by C.C. Kallen defeats C.C. and, with the help of Gino, proceeds to the \"Damocles\" for a final confrontation with Suzaku.\n\nAfter a fierce battle, Kallen manages to land a decisive blow on the \"Lancelot\"; however, this is at the cost of having her \"Guren\" completely disabled in the process and losing consciousness. While the \"Lancelot\" explodes, she falls from the floating fortress to what would have been her death had it not been for Gino's rescue. After the battle, she is taken along with many others who rebelled against Lelouch to execution, and then witnesses Lelouch's death by Suzaku disguised as Zero. She immediately understands what Lelouch has done, and stoutly proclaims that it is the real Zero with tears in her eyes.\n\nIn the two months following Lelouch's death, Kallen has forgiven Lelouch since she realized his intention—to sacrifice himself and through it to expunge the hatred of the world. She narrates about the changed world he created. She is shown living with her mother in the city. She still attends Ashford Academy and is one of the members of Rivalz's new Student Council, but has thrown away her frail cover, signified by her going to school with her preferred hairstyle and the \"Guren\"'s key around her neck. She keeps several photos of her friends in her room and smiles at the one with Lelouch before eating a piece of French toast, waving goodbye to her mother before hurrying to school.\n\nKallen's character poem in the Code Geass DVD reveals that she had fallen in love with Lelouch through her devotion to him and that if he had ever told her that he loved her again, she would've \"followed him to hell\". Knowing that she would do precisely that was the reason Lelouch remained silent, as had they consummated their feelings, she would have found out about the Zero Requiem, subsequently trying to talk him out of it and, if that didn't work, commit suicide, he wanted Kallen to live on. She then declares that it wasn't just because of that she fell in love with him, but also due to the noble actions she had always supported and revealed to her by Nunnally. Four months later, she is present for Lelouch's miracle over the Student Council, where he asks her to never give up on them and thanking her for staying in school; when he departs, she grimaces over the fact she will never stop loving him.\n\nKallen is a highly skilled Knightmare Frame pilot, rivaling the abilities of even the Knights of the Round. She is acknowledged as the best pilot of the Black Knights by enemies and allies alike. Her codename, \"Q-1,\" is the Queen's starting spot in descriptive chess notation. In Lelouch's assessment of the core members of the Black Knights, her \"Combat Ability\" score is 100 out of 100, matching that of Kyoshiro Tohdoh; she also has the highest possible \"Loyalty\" score of 100.\n\nEven when piloting outdated Knightmare Frames such as the \"Glasgow\", Kallen proves to be a dangerous opponent easily defeating numerous \"Sutherlands\", despite the \"Sutherland\" being a more advanced Knightmare. With the radiation arm of her \"Guren\" Mk-II, Kallen can take down almost any Knightmare Frame in a single attack should they allow her to make physical contact, and later models also have numerous secondary attack modes for mid- and long-range combat. Her Knightmare Frame is also incredibly fast, allowing her to fight on the same level as some of the most advanced Knightmare Frames in the series.\n\nOutside of a Knightmare, Kallen displays superior fighting abilities. She is nimble enough to swat a bee with a single swipe (and cut it in thirds), and on two occasions she defeats numerous armed men with little trouble. She is also apparently intelligent, since her grades in school are top of the class despite frequent absences.\n\nIn the video game spin-off \"\", Kallen was one of the characters Rai meets, along with the other student council members, and greeted him after he wakes up. If the player chooses either Black Knight route or Blue Moon route, Rai becomes Kallen's love interest as their relationship developed and attempts to be close to him, while the player interacts more with Kallen if the player progresses a relationship with her in the Blue Moon route.\n\nAt day 1 to 5, Kallen arrived at the school and meets Rai at the courtyard, leading the two to have a friendly interaction with each other and eventually causing all the male students around them to develop a killing intent on Rai.\n\nIn one scene, Kallen asks to meet Rai in a hot spring. The rest of the student council comes in while they are talking, resulting in Kallen trying to explain the misunderstanding. Kallen eventually walks out.\n\nIn the \"Blue Moon\" Route, Rai received a blue colored letter and follows the letters instructions to go a place, leading him to a church and finds Kallen there. Kallen confesses her love to him but fears that it won't work out for them and Rai reassuring her that it would. The next scene shows the two of them are dating and now a couple. Kallen makes Rai a lunchbox saying how he always works hard and tells him he should eat as much as possible.\n\nIn her first day, since Rai's arrival at Ashford Academy, Kallen arrived at Rai's place to lead him to the student council room by Milly. There she later suggested to go to different places that would trigger his memory, leading Milly to vote for Kallen as Rai's caretaker, which Shirley and Nina agrees. If the player chooses to have Kallen as her caretaker, Kallen herself becomes doubtful. If the player chooses not to have Kallen as her caretaker, Kallen sees him having doubt and decides to accept the role of his caretaker.\n\nWhen the student council members notice Rai being lively, they suspect Kallen may have influence him as they've been seen together lately and suspected having a relationship with him, which Kallen denied and ask Rai to clear up the misunderstanding. If the player choose to confirm Kallen's words, she becomes satisfied and the student council members sees them on good terms. If the player choose to confirm the student council's word, Kallen becomes shocked and embarrassed and the student council members becomes surprised and cheerful. After the two left, they decided to go to Shinjuku Ghetto, to search for a clue on Rai's identity.\n\nWhile searching through the ghetto, Kallen notice Rai recognizing a building and suspect Rai was Japanese, then notice Kallen's face brightened up. If the player chooses to say if she laughed at him, Kallen denies it and decides to look around more. If the player choose to say if she's happy, Kallen replied that he had remembered something since she's been keeping him company, which Rai thanked her. Later, the two are caught in a battle by a group of Anti-Britannian terrorists with \"Burai\" Kightmare Frames pretending to be the Black Knights and a group of Britannian \"Sutherlands\" and Knight Police Frames. As they try to escape, they see a \"Burai\" falling onto them. If the player chooses to Protect Kallen, Rai immediately grabs Kallen in between his arms and turned his back towards the \"Burai\". If the player chooses to thrust Kallen away, Rai lied face down on the ground, knocking Kallen to the ground as well. The two later went in the damaged \"Burai\", with Rai piloting it visually as the hatch can’t close while Kallen wrapped around his body and tried to escape, but later encountered a Sutherland who was targeting the \"Burai\" and started to attack. However Rai managed to defeat him easily, which led Kallen to become surprised and impressed. They later encountered the real Black Knights defeating both the terrorists and the Britannian army while they were helping the civilians escape, leading Kallen to have them recognize her and let them leave.\n\nThe next day in Ashford Academy, Kallen meets Rai in the courtyard and request she would talk to him in the rooftops involving the battle at Shinjuku. Kallen then asked Rai how he knew to easily pilot a Knightmare, which he replied that he just knew. If the player choose to say if he was a Britannian who was in the army before, Kallen thinks of it as a possibility. If the player choose to say what Kallen thinks, she replied the possibility of Rai being a soldier of a Japanese resistance cell, which Rai thinks of himself as a dangerous person, but Kallen comments that he should be happy about the clues of his identity increased. During lunch break after their discussion, both Kallen and Rai went to the cafeteria together, which cause the attention to the other students there, which both don't know why. Later Rivalz appeared with Lelouch and has teased them for the two being a couple after a rumor mentioning her relationship with Rai went well and the incident involving the two in the Shinjuku ghetto, which includes Rai protecting Kallen. The rumor has shocked Kallen and Rai, with Lelouch thanked Rai for his deed and Rivalz curious to know what. Although Kallen had confirmed that Rai had saved her, she was annoyed by Rivalz's constant bickering, which led to Lelouch convincing him not to bother her more.\n\nKallen later went to the Black Knight's hideout and meets with Zero to report about what happened in Shinjuku ghetto and revealed to him about Rai and his piloting skills. This report got Zero interested and was recommended by Kallen that he would join the Black Knights.\n\nThe next day, Kallen waited for Rai at the Ghetto Ruins, witnessed his arrival and revealed her true self to him, which slightly surprised Rai. Kallen then led Rai to an Underground Tunnel and requested him to join her to fight against Britannia, believing him to be Japanese, which has confused Rai. The two arrived at an Abandoned Building and Kallen introduces him to Zero and revealed herself as Kallen Kouzuki, a member of the Black Knights. Kallen also requested Rai to join them, and requested to Zero for his admission, which Zero let Rai to decide, but noted they will take measures to protect their secret. If the player chooses to have no choice or accepts to join, Kallen becomes pleased. However, if the player chooses that he is unsure, Kallen becomes shocked when Zero noted his silence mean he refused and prepares to open fire, but Kallen shielded Rai and begged him to join and revealed to him the Black Knights have an intelligence network to discover clues involving his past, leading Rai to have no choice but to join the Black Knights, but comments he will only trust Kallen.\n\nIn the \"Black Knights\" Route, Rai stops Princess Euphemia from following through with Lelouch's accidental Geass command (an alternate version to episode 22–23), which he was shot in the process. After Rai woke up and was healed, Kallen shows a great deal of gratitude toward Rai for saving the Japanese and shead in tears as Rai is alive and the two embrace each other as they kiss. Afterwards Rai and Kallen continue to be faithful members of the Black Knights.\n\nIn the \"Geass Route\" ending, Kallen was in the hangar tuning her \"Guren\" and was approached by Rai who wanted to talk to her. When Rai revealed that he's leaving the Black Knights, Kallen was shocked and demanded a reason from him. This led to Rai telling her that he has an illness and doesn't know how long he has left. After hearing this, Kallen ordered him to cure his illness and return. After Rai had left the hangar, Kallen turned to her \"Guren\" and slammed her fist in anger and sadness.\n\nThe manga differs from the real series focusing on the Black Knights activities; in the manga Kallen is not present during C.C's appearance. Lelouch's first meeting with her is also different as she bumps into him at school.\n\nKallen protests at the school rather than at the settlement. She is also apparently Zero's only soldier as only she helps him, such as when they rescue Suzaku.\n\nIn the manga spin-off series \"Nightmare of Nunnally\", Kallen and the other Resistance members took advantage of the arrival of Nunnally's \"Mark Nemo\" Knightmare Frame to make their escape from Britannian forces pursuing them.\n\nWhen Kallen escapes from the rooftops after she was taken hostage with the other student council members in a hotel at Lake Kawaguchi, she witnesses the arrival of the Mark Nemo. She later met up with Zero, who gave her a suitcase with the Black Knights uniform.\n\nIn the battle against Cornelia's forces in the Saitama ghetto, she met up with the Mark Nemo again and witness it destroying all of the Britannian forces, and thought it was on their side, but disagrees and starts to attack Kallen and her group. She was surprised that it knew her moves before it happened and was defeated.\n\nIn the manga spin-off \"Suzaku of the Counterattack\", Kallen becomes a member of the Black Knight after Zero forms the organization, but has doubts about his methods after a Black Knights faction had gone renegade and orchestrated an attack, taking the lives of nearby civilians, including Lenard Lubie.\n\nWhen Zero is planning to attack the Britannian Art Gallery with the goal of assassinating the Emperor who has arrived there, Kallen confronted him about whether it would be a trap and also commented that she would still follow him. Admiring her answer and loyalty, Lelouch placed a geass command on her that if anything would happen to him then she would lead the Black Knights. When the Black Knights took the Art Gallery hostage, she is confronted by Suzaku and was surprised that she's not only a member but a half Britannian-Japanese right after he left to stop Zero from killing the Emperor. After Lelouch was captured and accused for killing the Emperor, Kallen assume leadership of the Black Knights as the new Zero and later led the remaining Black Knight members to begin an assault on the Governor Building of Area 11, unaware that Lelouch is freed by Suzaku and are both planning to stop Schneizel.\n\nFive years later, a 22-year-old Kallen is seen walking on the street and still a member of the Black Knights and in contact, but while she was passing by, she suddenly saw someone who resembles a 17-year-old Suzaku, which she thinks she's imagine it.\n\nKallen makes an appearance in the \"\" video game in her Knightmare Frame, the \"Guren\" Mk-II in an alternative event of R2.\n\nKallen appeared in her world, in an alternative event of episode 6 of the second season, on a mission in her \"Guren Nishki\" to destroy a group of \"Caerleon\" battle ships until a group of \"Sutherland\" Knightmares appears. Kallen manages to defeat them all, but her \"Guren\"'s radiation surge wave arm was badly damaged, but also fell when the ship began to shake, which led Rakshata to send her unit to transform her \"Guren Nishki\" to the \"Guren Kashōshiki\". She later proceeds to destroy the other \"Caerleon\" along with Todoh in his \"Zangetsu\" Knightmare and encountered Suzaku in his \"Lancelot\" along with Gino in his \"Tristan\" and Anya in her \"Mordred\". Kallen had fought the three and defeated them, causing Suzaku to order a retreat to the Chinese Federation.\n\nAfter Zero kidnaps Empress Tianzi, Kallen fought against Xingke in his Knightmare Frame, \"Shen Hu\", while defending the \"Ikaruga\" flagship from being attacked by a group of \"Gun Ru\"'s. After the Enuches plans were exposed to the media, Kallen, along with Zero, C.C., and Xingke, have worked together and attack the Enuches land fortress, \"Leung Tan\", leading them to their deaths while the fortress explode. After being confronted by a fleet of Britannian Knightmares, including the four Rounds, the group encountered an unknown Black Hole and Kallen was sucked in along with Zero and C.C.\n\nKallen and the rest of the Code Geass R1 cast will make their debut to the Super Robot Wars franchise in this game, using their R1 Knightmares.\n\nIn a special OVA parody episode, based on the \"Alice in Wonderland\" story, Kallen appears in the role as the March Hare.\n"}

She is known for her 1936 publication \"Race and Population Policy Tools\", and her studies of heterochromia iridis (different-colored eyes) using iris specimens, supplied by Josef Mengele, from Auschwitz concentration camp victims.\n\nKarin Magnussen, daughter of the landscape painter and ceramist Walter Magnussen, grew up with her sister in a middle-class home. She completed her schooling in Bremen, graduating with a degree. She then studied biology, geology, chemistry and physics at the University of Göttingen. Magnussen joined the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB) while she was still an undergraduate in college. By 1931, at the age of 23 years, she was a member of the National Socialist German Workers Party. Later, she became a leader of the League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher Mädel, or BDM) and a member of the National Socialist Teachers League. As a BDM leader, she held lectures on the politics of race and population. She graduated in 1932 with an examination in the subjects of botany, zoology and geology. In July 1932, her thesis was accepted: \"Studies on the physiology of the butterfly wing\".\n\nAfter receiving her doctorate, she studied at the Zoological Institute of the University of Göttingen in Alfred Kühn. She placed first and later second on her state exam for a high school teaching position; \"inter alia\" in biology in 1936. In Hanover, Magnussen was employed as a teacher at a secondary school. Magnussen possibly modeled herself after \"...the biologist Agnes Bluhm, who worked at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut fur Biologie and wrote \"Die rassenhygienischen Aufgaben des weiblichen Arztes\", Berlin, 1934, and who unhesitatingly supported Hitler's regime.\" In 1935, Magnussen went to work in the Nazi Racial Policy Office in the District of Hanover. A year later, she wrote \"Race and Population Policy Tools\".\n\nMagnussen had already joined the National Socialist German Student League (NSDStB) during her studies. In 1931, she became a member of the NSDAP. Later, she became BDM leader and was a member of the National Socialist Teachers League (NSLB). In Bremen, she lectured on racism and demographics. Magnussen was BDM leader in the Gau. In 1935, she was employed in the Gau Hannover in the Racial Politics Office. Her publication of \"Race and Population Policy Tools\" appeared in 1936. In 1939, this work was published by Lehmann of Munich. After the end of the Second World War, in the Soviet zone of occupation, it appeared on the list of prohibited literature.\n\nIn the third published edition of 1943, Magnussen expressed the following:\n\"This war is not just about the preservation of the German people, but is about the question, which races and peoples should live in the future on European soil... Basically England had no interest in the prosecution of this war, but it is a very different people, working parasitically behind the scenes and which is afraid to lose everything. In all of the enemy States, Judaism has significant influence. And just as Judaism had probably the clearest recognition that in the decisive struggle, the question of them was to be decided. The current war must therefore be also about the repression of the black danger in the West and the elimination of the Bolshevik threat in the East, which still resolves a racial problem in Europe, which all States are more or less interested in: the Jewish question. Also the Jew who enjoys life as a host in our country, is our enemy, even if he does not actively engage with weapons in this fight. …From the European point of view, the Jewish question is resolved in that the emigrant Jews do the thinking for the leaders in the other States. We have seen that these emigrants are only troublesome and set up the peoples against each other.\"\n\nDue to receiving a scholarship, Magnussen was suspended in the fall of 1941 from her teaching profession and moved to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics (KWI-A), in Berlin-Dahlem. From this time on, she worked in the Department of Experimental Pathology of Heritage under the Department head, Hans Nachtsheim. Her research focused on the inheritance of eye color in rabbits and humans. Her particular interest was the Heterochromic iris that she had examined since 1938. Magnussen used the scientific method to lead her to the conclusion that the eye is not only genetically, but also hormonally-determined. While there, she initially undertook studies on rabbit eyes. In July 1943, she was the research assistant of Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer, at the KWI-A. At the KWI-A she also met Dr Mengele, who worked there temporarily.\nThe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) promoted her study to \"explore the heritage conditionality for the development of eye color as a basis for racial and ethnicity studies\" in 1943, in addition to eight other research projects at the KWI-A. This project was overseen and the publication edited by Magnussen.\n\nFrom a colleague, she received the information that more twins and family members with Heterochromic irises would be found in the Sinti family in Mechau from northern Germany. Members of the family were taken in the spring of 1943 to the KWI-A, where they were photographed. In March 1943, the Sinti family in the Auschwitz concentration camp was deported, where Mengele had worked since late May 1943 as camp physician. This circumstance allowed Mengele to carry out the experiments (that Magnussen had done on rabbits) on the people. \n\nAccording to a statement by Magnussen, Mengele dealt, among other things, with the eyes of these Sinti family using hormonal substances. Often, these painful interventions resulted in suppuration of the eyes and blindness of the victims. These experiments aimed at the investigation and eradication of the abnormality in people with Heterochromic Irises. In the event of death of the prisoners, Mengele pledged to Magnussen to give her the eyes of the victims for further research and evaluation. In the second half of 1944, Magnussen received the eyes of the experiment victims from Auschwitz-Birkenau in several deliveries. No fewer than 40 pairs of eyes should have been received by Magnussen from Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Hungarian prisoner pathologist Miklós Nyiszli noted after the autopsy of Sinti twins that they had been killed, not due to illness, but because of a chloroform injection to the heart. Nyiszli had to prepare their eyes and send them to the KWI-A.\n\nAt least until the spring of 1945, Magnussen was working in Berlin.\nAfter the end of the Second World War, Magnussen moved to Bremen again and continued her research. Her completed research was published in 1949, being entitled \"\"On the relationship between histological distribution of pigment, Iris color and pigmentation of the eyeball of the human eye\".\" She was later denazified in Bremen.\n\nIn 1950, Magnussen taught at a girls' high school in Bremen. She worked as study counselor and official, including the teaching of biology. She was considered a popular teacher who led an interesting biology lesson. Magnussen's pupils could examine, for example, living and dead rabbits from their breeding. Until 1964, essays in scientific journals were published by Magnussen. Magnussen retired in August 1970. Even in old age, Magnussen justified the Nazi racial ideology. She noted in 1980, in a conversation with the geneticist Benno Müller-Hill, that the Nuremberg Laws were not fair enough. She also denied until the last minute that Mengele would have killed children for their scientific studies. She was entangled by her cooperation with Mengele and the supply of \"human material\", and mired deep in concentration camp crimes, but she claimed to know nothing about them.\n\nIn 1990, Magnussen moved into a nursing home; she died in February 1997 in Bremen.\n\n\n"}

It is approximately high, and overlooks the small river valley of Katskhura, a right affluent of the Q'virila.\n\nThe rock, with visible church ruins on a top surface measuring 150 m, has been venerated by locals as the Pillar of Life and a symbol of the True Cross, and has become surrounded by legends. It remained unclimbed by researchers and unsurveyed until 1944 and was more systematically studied from 1999 to 2009. These studies determined the ruins were of an early medieval hermitage dating from the 9th or 10th century. A Georgian inscription paleographically dated to the 13th century suggests that the hermitage was still extant at that time. Religious activity associated with the pillar was revived in the 1990s and the monastery building had been restored within the framework of a state-funded program by 2009.\n\nThe Katskhi pillar complex currently consists of a church dedicated to Maximus the Confessor, a crypt (burial vault), three hermit cells, a wine cellar, and a curtain wall on the uneven top surface of the column. At the base of the pillar are the newly built church of Simeon Stylites and ruins of an old wall and belfry.\n\nThe church of St. Maximus the Confessor is located at the south-easternmost corner of the top surface of the Katskhi pillar. A small simple hall church design with the dimensions of 4.5 × 3.5 m., it is a modern restoration of the ruined medieval church built of stone. Beneath and south of the church is an elongated rectangular crypt with the dimensions of 2.0 × 1.0 m., which had served as a burial vault. Digs at the ruined wine cellar revealed eight large vessels known in Georgia as \"k'vevri\". Also of note is a rectangular cellar grotto with the entrance and two skylights—on the vertical surface of the rock, some below the top. At the very base of the pillar there is a cross in relief, exhibiting parallels with similar early medieval depictions found elsewhere in Georgia, particularly at Bolnisi.\n\nIn historical records, the Katskhi pillar is first mentioned by the 18th-century Georgian scholar Prince Vakhushti, who reports in his \"Geographic Description of the Kingdom of Georgia\": \"There is a rock within the ravine standing like a pillar, considerably high. There is a small church on the top of the rock, but nobody is able to ascend it; nor know they how to do that.\" No other written accounts of monastic life or ascents survive. A number of local legends surround the pillar. One of them has it that the top of the rock was connected by a long iron chain to the dome of the Katskhi church, located at a distance of around 1.5 km from the pillar.\n\nIn July 1944 a group led by the mountaineer Alexander Japaridze and the writer Levan Gotua made the first documented ascent of the Katskhi pillar. Vakhtang Tsintsadze, an architecture specialist with the group, reported in his 1946 paper that the ruins found on top of the rock were remains of two churches, dating from the 5th and 6th centuries and associated with a stylite practice, a form of Christian asceticism. Since 1999, the Katskhi pillar has become the subject of more systematic research. Based on further studies and archaeological digs conducted in 2006, Giorgi Gagoshidze, an art historian with the Georgian National Museum, re-dated the structures to the 9th–10th century. He concluded that this complex was composed of a monastery church and cells for hermits. Discovery of the remnants of a wine cellar also undermined the idea of extreme ascetism flourishing on the pillar. In 2007, a small limestone plate with the \"asomtavruli\" Georgian inscriptions was found, paleographically dated to the 13th century and revealing the name of a certain \"Giorgi\", responsible for the construction of three hermit cells. The inscription also makes mention of the Pillar of Life, echoing the popular tradition of veneration of the rock as a symbol of the True Cross.\n\nReligious activity started to revive in 1995, with the arrival of the monk Maxim Qavtaradze, a native of Chiatura. Between 2005 and 2009, the monastery building on the top of the pillar was restored with the support of the National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia. The rock was once accessible to male visitors through an iron ladder running from its base to the top, but has recently been deemed inaccessible to the public.\n"}

She was taught painting by the Danish flower painter Cladius Detlev Fritzsch. There also are records of her painting in Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg's studio. When she was 20, she was engaged to the writer Bernhard Severin Ingemann, whom she married in July 1822. They lived in Sorø, where they entertained other Danish cultural figures such as Hans Christian Andersen and Bertel Thorvaldsen. Bernhard Ingemann, who wrote poetry, supported Lucie's interest in painting.\n\nAlthough Ingemann painted a few portraits and genre works, she concentrated mainly on flower paintings and, from the mid-1820s, on religious figures. She showed at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1824 and 1826, in both cases presenting flower paintings. She shared with her husband a deep sense of art and religion with the result that even her flower paintings often reflected religious and mystical themes inspired by German Romanticism. Her large biblical compositions and altar paintings are convincing, perhaps thanks to the guidance of Johan Ludwig Lund. In some cases she abandons perspective in favour of a spaciousness depicting spiritual mystery. \nHer many religious works were integrated in altarpieces in Danish churches, although many have now been removed.\n\nIngemann is one of the few known nineteenth-century women who devoted her life to painting. She also played an important role in the Ingemanns' home despite the fact that references to her come mainly from accounts of her husband's life.\n\nLucie Ingemann died in Sorø on 15 January 1868. \n\n"}

Knox Professor of English Literature and American Studies at Yale University. He also writes for \"Artforum\", \"The Nation\", \"The Advocate\", and \"The Village Voice\". He is the author of \"Publics and Counterpublics\", \"The Trouble with Normal: Sex, Politics, and the Ethics of Queer Life\", \"The English Literatures of America, 1500–1800\", \"Fear of a Queer Planet\", and \"The Letters of the Republic\". He edited \"The Portable Walt Whitman\" and \"American Sermons: The Pilgrims to Martin Luther King, Jr.\"\n\nBorn September 9, 1958, Warner received two Master of Arts degrees, from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Johns Hopkins University, in 1981 and 1983 respectively. He received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in English from Johns Hopkins University in 1986. Warner assumed his position at Yale University in 2007, and became Seymour H. Knox Professor of English Literature and American studies in 2008. Prior to his work at Yale, he taught at Northwestern University (1985–1990) and Rutgers University (1990–2007).\n\nWarner is highly influential in the fields of early American literature, social theory, and queer theory. His first book, \"The Letters of the Republic: Publication and the Public Sphere in Eighteenth-Century America\", established him as a leading scholar in Early American literature, print culture, and public sphere theory. He later became a public figure in the gay community for his book \"The Trouble with Normal\", in which Warner contended that queer theory and the ethics of a queer life serve as critiques of existing social and economic structures, not just as critique of heterosexuality and heterosexual society. His most recent work, \"Publics and Counterpublics\" is a collection of essays on the politics of communication in advanced capitalistic societies, or Habermasian public sphere theory.\n\nWarner is currently working on the history of secularism in early America, from the early eighteenth century to the Civil War, culminating with the work of Walt Whitman, a writer on whom many of his interests converge.\n\nWarner has been a permanent fellow of Rutger University's Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture since 2001, and was a director from 2006-2008. He also sits on a number of Advisory Boards, including that of the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies (since 1999), the Society for the Humanities at Cornell University (since 2003), and the Library of America Colonial Writing Project (since 2005).\n\nWarner is, along with Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Teresa de Lauretis, Lauren Berlant, and Judith Butler, considered one of the founders of queer theory.\n\nIn \"The Trouble With Normal\", Warner critiques same-sex marriage activism and other moves more generally by the gay rights movement toward equality in normalcy. The book has been described as a classic of the debates on normalcy as a goal for the gay rights movement, and as an important contribution to queer theory. Martha Nussbaum, writing in the \"New Republic\", praised the book's moral opposition to \"the domination of the 'normal': \"Warner is a deft and thoughtful writer who turns his own experience of the margins into a source of genuine understanding about America and its sexual politics...what Warner's book finally demands of us is...genuine reflection.\" First published in 1999 by The Free Press, an imprint of Simon and Schuster, it was re-published in 2000 in paperback by Harvard University Press. Warner argues that the right to marry is an inadequate and ultimately undesirable goal for gay rights activism. Chapter one, \"The Ethics of Sexual Shame\", argues that people with deviant sexualities have been shamed, as a result of American society's relegation of sex to the private domain, where it is not talked about. It provides a list of sexual hierarchies, as well as discussion of stigma, shame, moral panics, and queer life. Chapter two, \"What's Wrong with Normal?\", critiques the notion of normalcy. In this chapter, Warner looks at the arguments of Georges Canguilhem and Alfred Kinsey to discuss issues with the concept of norms and \"The Normalized Movement\" within gay rights activism. Chapter three, \"Beyond Gay Marriage\", takes the concepts from chapter two to argue against same-sex marriage, and marriage as an institution that reinforces privacy and diminishes the queer counterpublic. Chapter four, \"Zoning Out Sex\", discusses the zoning laws put in place by New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. These laws were also critiqued in the article Warner co-wrote with Lauren Berlant in 1998, titled \"Sex in Public\". The conclusion \"The Politics of Shame and HIV Prevention\", discusses some of the health strategies of fighting HIV/AIDS, and how the cycle of shame increases the risk of spreading the disease. The book, according to \"Kirkus Reviews\", argues \"persuasively\" against same-sex marriage.\n\n\"Publics and Counterpublics\" is a collection of essays based around the central question \"what is a public?\" Around half of the essays in the book have been published previously. Chapter one, \"Public and Private\", reviews the definitions of these terms, and traces the history of debates around public and private spheres, particularly around the women's liberation, and then the gay rights, movements. Chapter two, \"Publics and Counterpublics\", looks at redefining and expanding upon the term \"public\", to introduce multiple publics. The chapter then introduces the concept of counterpublics, initially termed by Nancy Fraser to mean a public that is subordinate to a dominant public. Chapter three, \"Styles of Intellectual Publics\", considers the style of discourse in academic work and the impact this has on the type of public it creates. It suggests that Michel Foucault might have described intellectual work as a counterpublic, and discusses this possibility. Chapter four, \"The Mass Public and the Mass Subject\", responds to Jürgen Habermas' \"The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere\" introducing some of the concepts we now regard as queer theory. As the essay was originally published in 1989, it was written before the term \"queer theory\" had become widely used. Chapter five, \"Sex in Public\", was co-written with Lauren Berlant, and published previously in 1998. \"Sex in Public\" serves as a case study in the struggles over the mediation of publics, and is very similar, thematically, to \"The Trouble With Normal\". Chapter six, \"Something Queer About the Nation State\", discusses queer politics and activism, and its relationship to the state. Chapter seven, \"A Soliloquy 'Lately Spoken at the African Theatre': Race and the Public Sphere in New York City, 1821\", considers an historical counterpublic and its context, and the texts that upheld it. Chapter eight, \"Whitman Drunk\" critiques Walt Whitman's work \"Franklin Evans\" and its reception in the context of temperance activism.\n\n\"Publics and Counterpublics\", argues fellow queer theorist Ken Plummer, extended the public/private debate and contributed to the development of queer theory.\n\nBoth of these major works discuss to some extent how queer straddles the public/private divide. \"The Trouble With Normal\" argues that the gay rights struggle for marriage equality is a struggle for normalcy, and privacy. This privacy, Warner argues, comes at the cost of those who do not marry, who choose to conduct themselves in public. \"Publics and Counterpublics\" considers the public sphere and its shortcomings, before considering how queer both exists in, and is subordinated by, publics. Warner calls the two books \"mutually illustrative\", with \"The Trouble With Normal\" critiquing the way gay rights movements have obscured queer counterpublics, one of the central concepts of \"Public and Counterpublics\".\n\n\n\n\"Awarded the Foerster Prize for best essay in American Literature, 2001.\" \n\"Awarded the Foerster Prize for the best essay in American Literature, 1992; awarded the Crompton-Noll Award for best essay in lesbian and gay studies, 1993.\"\n\n\n"}

After the shooting, the \"Post\" publisher Paul Cobb revealed on television that, prior to Bailey's killing, Cobb had withheld from publication a story that Bailey had written earlier, saying only that it was about \"things like\" what happened to Bailey. He later stated that the police had asked him not to reveal anything about the matter. On August 6, 2007 a former employee of the bakery, Ali Saleem Bey, who is not a relative of the bakery's owner, but who adopted the Bey name, revealed that he was Bailey's source for the withheld story, which the \"Post\" had decided was not ready for publication. Bailey had asked Bey to give him the story.\n\nAccording to Ali Bey, the bakery business had been seized from its rightful heirs in a coup through fraud and forgery, by a ruthless, younger branch of the family, beginning with Antar Bey and culminating with the current chief executive officer, Yusuf Bey IV. Ali revealed that in June 2005, John Bey, the former head of the Bey security service, was driven out of town with his family after an attempt on his life in a shooting outside his home. John had tried to expose the fraud behind the coup. In 2005, Antar Bey mortgaged the bakery property, to cover back taxes and other debt, and then defaulted, which led to threat of foreclosure.\nAn attorney for the \"Post\" also confirmed that Bailey had been working on the story about the \"financial status of the organization\" and including the possibly criminal \"activities of a number of people who were working in the organization\".\n\nOn October 24, 2006, Your Black Muslim Bakery, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing its CEO as Yusuf Ali Bey, otherwise known as Yusuf Bey IV. With $900,000 in debts, owed mostly to the mortgage holder, the building was about to be foreclosed upon. The remaining debt, $200,000, was owed to the Internal Revenue Service. The day after Bailey's death, on August 3, 2007 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Edward Jellen ordered the case to be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation effective August 9, 2007.\n\nBy 2007 Bailey was living in an apartment near the south end of Lake Merritt, not far from downtown Oakland. He was known to walk to work as a daily routine, and to stop for breakfast at a McDonald's restaurant at 14th Street and Jackson Street, about a half-block from where he was killed in the 200 block of 14th Street, becoming Oakland's 72nd homicide of 2007.\n\nOn the morning of August 2, 2007, Bailey set out on his usual walk to work. Unknown to him, Devaughndre Broussard, a 19-year-old handyman at Your Black Muslim Bakery, who was on probation for a San Francisco robbery conviction, had discovered Bailey's residence. Broussard had worked at the bakery as a handyman and cook between August 2006 and March 2007, before leaving to find other work. He was rehired at the bakery in July 2007.\n\nBroussard then, in a white Ford Aerostar van, began driving around the route he thought Bailey would be taking to work. Broussard insisted that he acted alone, but police believe he had an accomplice in the van. At 7:25 a.m. Broussard spotted Bailey leaving the McDonald's restaurant where Bailey regularly stopped to eat breakfast. Broussard then got out of the van, parked on Alice Street. Wearing a mask and dark clothing, he approached Bailey with the shotgun. A witness said Bailey said: \"Please don't kill me.\" The witness claimed he recognized Bailey, and that he was in trouble, but stopped in his tracks when he saw the shotgun.\n\nAs he walked from home to work, Bailey was shot dead around 7:30 a.m. on 14th Street near Alice Street in Oakland's Lakeside Apartments District in what police described as an assassination. Witnesses said the single gunman wearing dark clothing and a ski mask approached Bailey and fired at least three rounds from a shotgun, hitting Bailey at least once in the chest, then fled on foot to a waiting van and drove off.\n\nThe gunman first fired a shotgun blast at Bailey's chest, then stood over him and fired again execution style at Bailey's face while Bailey was down, and then fired a coup de grâce to make sure he was dead. The assassin then escaped in the van. Bailey was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nPolice Chief Wayne Tucker described the killing as \"unusual\" because it occurred downtown and in broad daylight.\n\nThe Mossberg shotgun used in the murder was later identified as one stolen during a liquor store vandalism two years prior suspected to have been committed by members of Your Black Muslim Bakery.\n\nBailey was survived by his father, three of his four siblings, and his teenage son living in southern California. A funeral mass was held at the East Oakland St. Benedict's Catholic Church on the morning of August 8, 2007, with an overflowing crowd of 700 in attendance, including a line of people outside for more than an hour into the service. Attendees included Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums, U.S. Representative Barbara Lee, actress Luenell, assistant dean of the University of California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism Paul Grabowicz who once worked with Bailey at the Tribune, and well-known local attorney John Burris. Bailey was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in nearby Hayward.\n\nDevaughndre Broussard grew up in San Francisco's Western Addition district. The office of the San Francisco District Attorney revealed that in January 2006, at age 18, Broussard plead guilty to an assault charge, and served a first-time offender sentence of one year in San Francisco county jail. Upon release, Broussard was also ordered to three years of supervised probation. In addition to his probation status, he was wanted on an outstanding failure-to-appear warrant for his arrest, charged with a 2006 assault with a firearm in San Francisco.\n\nPolice revealed that on the night of August 1, 2007, Broussard first went looking for Bailey at his apartment complex, having discovered Bailey's residence near the south end of Lake Merritt. Early on the next morning of August 2, 2007 Broussard looked for Bailey at his office, but Bailey had not yet arrived. Police revealed that Broussard also went looking for Bailey twice again at his apartment complex that morning. At 7:17 a.m. an AC Transit bus driver may have seen Broussard near Bailey's apartment, standing outside with the shotgun at First Avenue and International Boulevard. The driver called his dispatcher, who reported the incident to the Alameda County Sheriff's Office. The driver continued on his route, and deputies responded to the location, but could not locate the man in their search.\n\nYusuf Bey IV was born in Oakland in 1986, the son of Daulet and Yusuf Bey, the latter of whom was the founder of the Your Black Muslim Bakery. His life was marred by arrests and accusations of serious crimes.\n\nBey IV lived a chaotic, violent life before his arrest for participating in the murder of journalist Chauncey Bailey.\n\nYusuf Bey IV grew up in what must have been a turbulent home. His father Yusuf Bey had several children with multiple women, and in 1988, when Bey IV was two, three of the women left the home and took their nine children with them. At the time of his death in 2003, Bey Sr. was said to have fathered 42 children by various women. He had one legal wife, Farieda Bey. Bey's followers and \"wives\" often took his surname, although no legal adoptions or marriages took place. Bey claimed he had \"spiritually\" adopted followers who used his name. People who worked for the bakery were considered \"members\" of the business and the mosque from which the bakery had grown.\n\nBey IV was arrested in El Cerrito, California, in September 2001 after failing to stop at a stop sign. Police discovered a magazine with bullets in his possession. He was 15 at the time.\n\nDespite years of suspicion and serious brushes with the law, Yusuf Bey Sr. remained uncharged with any wrongdoing until 2002. In that year, he was accused of lewd conduct by a girl who had been a foster child of Nora and Yusuf Bey twenty years earlier. DNA evidence was conclusive enough for prosecutors to schedule a court date, but before the trial could begin, Bey died of cancer. Bey Sr. had spent years preaching Black Muslim sermons on Oakland radio, and the arrest and charge came as a somewhat of a shock to the surrounding community, who regarded the elder Bey as a local hero because of his renowned business, his support for black empowerment, his association with prominent politicians, and his supposed adherence to his Black Muslim faith.\n\nAfter the death of Bey Sr., Waajid Aljawwaad (who sometimes used the additional last name of Bey), a follower of Bey Sr., became the CEO of the business as Yusuf Bey Sr.'s designated successor. However, on February 27, 2004, Aljawwaad failed to arrive for work at the bakery. His body, bound with electrical tape and wrapped in a tarpaulin, was found in Oakland Hills in July of that year. No one was ever charged with the crime.\n\nAntar Bey, Daulet and Yusuf Bey's son and older brother of Yusuf Bey IV, seized control of the bakery. Antar's half siblings and their mothers protested and fought with him over control of the business, but to no avail; Antar was able to retain control and force them out. He soon took out $700,000 in loans that went into default. But in October 2005, Antar was killed in a carjacking in Oakland. Authorities suspected Yusuf Bey IV of ordering Antar's execution but could not provide proof. Oakland police charged a man unrelated to the bakery with the murder.\n\nAfter this, Bey IV took full control of the business.\n\nBey IV seemed primarily interested in the profits the bakery earned and the power over the members of the business his father had engendered, not the day-to-day operation of the business. He alternately took money from the business and conducted various fraud operations to support himself and the business before it failed. His father, the bakery and its members had enjoyed years of protection from the media and politicians against bad publicity, investigations and even prosecution, continuing up to the lewd conduct charge against Yusuf Bey Sr.\n\nAfter the death of his father, gaining control of the bakery and associated security businesses, and triumph over the feuding family members, Bey IV's crimes grew more and more serious. Despite several arrests, he remained free and flouted subpoenas and ignored court dates. His lawyer said at the time, \"The view was, 'We're Black Muslims, we can do anything we want.' They got sucked in. I thought it was 'acting out' behavior. But it caused just a whirlwind of trouble.\"\n\nBey IV continued his father's practice of delivering fiery Black Muslim sermons to bakery followers. In one videotaped sermon dated to July 2007, Bey IV said, \"We fight the government, we fight the police, we fight our own families, we fight our own people, and we fight Caucasian people daily—just to do right.\"\n\nSome of the crimes Bey IV committed during this period included theft by deception and forgery involving the purchase of several cars; fraudulent sub-prime home loan applications; possession of a firearm after attempting to open a checking account using forged identification; and a bizarre kidnapping and assault on a woman Bey IV believed was connected with drug dealers who owed him money, or whom he could rob.\n\nBelow are some of the charges and arrests for Yusuf Bey IV.\n\n\n\nOn the day of the killing Oakland Police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland offered up to $25,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest of the killer.\n\nBeginning early at 5 a.m. on the following morning of August 3, 2007, more than 200 Oakland police officers and SWAT team members armed with search warrants closed off a number of blocks of San Pablo Avenue, a major thoroughfare in North Oakland. The area of focus included homes and the business properties of Your Black Muslim Bakery, which operated two business locations on either side of the street between Stanford Avenue and 59th Street. The group is a Black Muslim splinter organization founded by Yusuf Bey, and now led by his son Yusuf Bey IV. The pre-dawn raids followed a two-month investigation into a variety of violent crimes, including kidnapping and murder. Police used stun grenades and broke down doors to gain entry. In a news conference later that day, Oakland Deputy Police Chief Howard Jordan said that several weapons and other evidence of value linked the killing of Chauncey Bailey to members of the group. Police also recovered spent ammunition from the rooftops, and detained 19 people for questioning.\n\nIn addition to the bakeries, the police also raided nearby homes. In the 1000 block of 59th Street, police recovered, from a closet, the shotgun used in the killing of Bailey at the home where Broussard was also detained. The rear yard of the home connected directly to the bakery property. Police also raided a home in the 900 block of Aileen Street a few blocks east of the bakery. Of the 19 detainees on that morning, five were arrested along with Broussard, and Yusuf Bey IV, on probable cause arrest warrants, along with other outstanding arrest warrants, stemming from the prior investigations.\n\nBroussard was booked on suspicion of murder on August 4, 2007, for the killing of Bailey, having told police detectives that he considered himself \"a good soldier\". Though other charges were made against those arrested, none of them were charged with Bailey's murder. On August 7 Broussard was arraigned in Alameda County Superior Court, on charges of murder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n\nBroussard initially confessed to killing Bailey, then recanted his confession. In a 2008 \"60 Minutes\" interview, Broussard claimed he was coerced by Yusuf Bey IV to plead guilty for the benefit of the bakery and others arrested. In an interview for CBS News, Broussard said that the Oakland Police put him and Bey IV together in a room, and that Bey IV convinced him to plead guilty for the purpose of releasing other murder suspects. He later pled guilty to manslaughter charges in exchange for a 25-year sentence and full testimony at the trial of Bey IV and others.\n\nIn June 2008 a videotape of Bey IV in custody whispering to his half-brother Joshua Bey and another bakery associate, Tamon Halfin, and disclosing details of Bailey's murder was obtained and posted by the Chauncey Bailey Project. Journalists from the Chauncey Bailey Project created a transcription of the conversation which seemed to indicate Bey was involved in Bailey's murder.\n\nA grand jury indicted Bey IV with ordering the execution of Chauncey Bailey in April 2009, almost two years after the murder.\n\nBroussard testified for the prosecution at the trial of Bey IV and Antoine Mackey in 2011. He stated in court that Bey ordered him to find, track and kill Bailey before the journalist could print his latest article on the bakery.\n\nOn June 9, 2011 Bey IV and Mackey were both convicted by a trial jury of multiple counts of murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Yusuf Bey IV was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder.\n\nIn 2013 Bey's attorney, Lorna Brown, was convicted of smuggling documents out of jail for him. One of the documents, a hit list ordering an associate to kill a witness, was intercepted by police before the associate could carry out the murder. In 2015, a state appeals court upheld the convictions of Yusuf Bey IV and Antoine Mackey.\n\nBey IV also threatened former bakery followers to intimidate them from testifying against him. Based on recorded calls between Bey IV and follower Kahlil Raheem, Bey first cajoled and then warned Raheem not to testify against him. As the trial progressed, allegations of intimidation by Bey IV and other former bakery members persisted. The \"Contra Costa Times\" editorialized on April 30, 2011, that the intimidation must stop and that the judge, Thomas Reardon, along with bailiffs and the sheriff should get control of the trial to allow justice to be done. Some witnesses called to testify changed their story from the original information they gave the police or said they did not remember what happened. A man who worked at the convenience store that Bey IV allegedly attacked with his followers said he did not remember over 50 times at trial. Even Broussard testified later that he does not remember Bey IV giving him specific orders to kill Odell Roberson or Chauncey Bailey.\n\n"}

In 1841 he escaped from his Arkansas master, Alfred Wallace on a stolen horse, and 6 weeks later crossed the border and entered Canada.\n\nWallace, however, refused to let the matter drop, and he was well connected, particularly to the Governor of Arkansas, Archibald Yell. Wallace and an associate, George C. Grigg, travelled to Canada and made out dispositions against Hackett for stealing the horse, as well as a gold watch belonging to Wallace.\n\nDespite opposition from Upper Canada's attorney general, William Henry Draper, Hackett was extradited to the United States on the order of Sir Charles Bagot, due to his theft of the watch, which exceeded what was necessary to take in order to facilitate his escape to freedom.\nPublic reaction from abolitionists, in England, Canada and the United States was strong. Politicians in the British House of Commons and Upper Canada's executive council questioned the motives for the extradition, as well as its legality.\n\nWallace seems to have been intent on \"teaching a lesson\" to American slaves; namely that Canada would not prove to be a safe haven for them. The fact that his legal bills far exceeded Hackett's market value seems to bear this out. In any event, his strategy failed. Hackett's escape brought more attention to Canada as a refuge for slaves, and when the extradition clause of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty was finally negotiated, slaves were protected from extradition to their former American masters.\n\n"}

Following the Sétif massacre, he was among those who pushed for the formation of an armed clandestine network, the Organisation Spéciale (OS). The OS was soon crushed by France, and in 1948 he was arrested by France and imprisoned in Blida military prison, where he was tortured.

He is a cast member on \"Saturday Night Live\". Davidson has also appeared on the MTV shows \"Guy Code\", \"Wild 'n Out\", and \"Failosophy\". He has performed stand-up comedy on \"Adam DeVine's House Party\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", and \"Comedy Underground with Dave Attell\", and guest-starred in \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\".\n\nDavidson was born November 16, 1993, in Staten Island, New York, the son of Amy (\"née\" Waters) and Scott Matthew Davidson. His father was of mostly Jewish heritage and his mother is of Irish ancestry; Davidson was raised Catholic. He has a younger sister named Casey. His father was a New York City firefighter who died in service during the September 11 attacks; he was last seen running up the stairs of the Marriott World Trade Center, just prior to its collapse. Davidson, who was seven years old at the time, was profoundly affected by the loss. He told \"The New York Times\" that it was \"overwhelming\" and that he would often act out in school as a result of the trauma, at one point ripping his hair out until he was bald. In October 2016, Davidson revealed on \"The Breakfast Club\" morning radio show that he struggled with suicidal thoughts when he was younger, and that the music of rap artist Kid Cudi saved his life.\n\nDavidson first tried his hand at stand-up comedy at age 16 in a Staten Island bowling alley, where a group of friends, knowing of his comedy aspirations, dared him to take to the stage. He did so only after smoking marijuana. Davidson, who has suffered from Crohn's disease since the age of 17 or 18, at the time said he \"cannot function\" without marijuana, adding that he would not be able to work on \"Saturday Night Live\", and that attempts to perform without it have not been successful. He explained that he \"can perform when [he's] not high, but it wouldn't be that much fun for [him].\" He attended St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School, then Tottenville High School before transferring to Xaverian High School in Brooklyn where he graduated in 2011. His mother still works as the school nurse at the latter. Following high school, he enrolled at St. Francis College in Brooklyn Heights, remaining briefly before dropping out.\n\nDavidson's earliest onscreen appearance was in the third episode of the MTV comedy series \"Failosophy\", which premiered February 28, 2013. The following month, he appeared in \"PDA and Moms,\" a third-season episode of the MTV2 reality TV comedy series \"Guy Code\", the first of four episodes in which he was featured. That June, his first televised standup aired as part of a second-season episode of the Comedy Central program \"Gotham Comedy Live\", which showcases standup comedians at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City. The following month, he returned to MTV2 with an appearance on \"\", his first of six episode appearances on that show.\n\nDavidson subsequently made standup appearances on \"Adam Devine's House Party\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", \"Comedy Underground with Dave Attell\", and guest-starred in \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\". In 2014, he acquired a role in a Fox comedy pilot, \"Sober Companion\", but it ultimately did not make it to series.\n\nDavidson joined the cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" with that show's 40th-season premiere, which debuted on September 27, 2014. At age 20, he was the first \"SNL\" cast member to be born in the 1990s, and one of the youngest cast members ever. The first new addition to the cast that season, Davidson was given a chance to audition for the show through regular Bill Hader, whom he had met while filming a small part in the 2015 Judd Apatow feature film comedy \"Trainwreck\". Hader subsequently told producer Lorne Michaels about him. His debut garnered positive critical notice, with his most noted skits during the season including an \"Indiana Jones\"-style sketch in which he and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, after being pelted with poison darts, were forced to mutually suck poison out of each other's various body parts, an endeavor that eventually found them entangled in the \"69\" position. Another involved Davidson being shot in the chest with an arrow by Norman Reedus.\n\nIn March 2015, Davidson was a roaster on the \"Comedy Central Roast\" of Justin Bieber, and his set was praised as one of the best of the show. Among his bolder jokes was one at the expense of fellow roaster Snoop Dogg and host Kevin Hart, and their 2004 film \"Soul Plane\". Davidson, whose firefighter father died responding to the September 11 attacks, called that film \"the worst experience of my life involving a plane.\"\n\nIn 2016, Davidson was on the \"Forbes\" 30 under 30 list. Also in 2016, Davidson recorded his first stand-up special \"Pete Davidson: SMD.\" The Comedy Central special was filmed in New York City. He made an appearance on \"The Jim Gaffigan Show.\"\n\nIn November 2018, Davidson was criticized for his comments mocking the Republican congressional candidate and veteran Dan Crenshaw, who wears an eye patch because of an injury from the War in Afghanistan. Davidson compared Crenshaw to a \"hitman in a porno movie\", and added, \"I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war, or whatever.\" Davidson later invited Crenshaw for a Weekend Update segment on SNL. In the episode, Davidson apologized to Crenshaw, and they made further jokes and references that it is Veterans Day. Crenshaw and others have speculated that the joke may have helped him win Texas's 2nd congressional district in the midterm election.\n\nDavidson has been lauded for basing his comedy on his own life and employing aspects of his life that have been likened to \"a series of brutal truths and vulgar confessions,\" and which make him relatable to audiences. Touching upon topics such as marijuana, sex, and relationships, incidents he relates include those from his awkward high school experiences to living in a dormitory during his brief stint at St. Francis College. Davidson jokes about highly sensitive subjects, including the loss of his father during the September 11 attacks, because, he says, he finds that it empowers him to address the feeling of powerlessness that experiencing such tragedy at a young age inflicted upon him. He is a fan of the \"Harry Potter\" franchise, and has incorporated that material into his comedy work as well.\n\nAs of October 2015, Davidson lives in Brooklyn Heights, New York.\n\nThe death of Davidson's father caused psychological problems for him growing up. His father was a firefighter and first-responder during the September 11 attacks. Davidson has his father's badge number, 8418, tattooed on his left arm.\n\nDavidson supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and on December 5, 2017, he stated on his Instagram account that he got a tattoo on his leg of Clinton, whom he called his \"hero\", a \"badass\", and \"one of the strongest people in the universe.\" Clinton herself thanked Davidson for the compliment, commenting, \"This makes it significantly less awkward that I've had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years.\"\n\nHe was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at age 17 or 18, for which he receives intravenous treatment and used medical marijuana as a pain reliever. On March 6, 2017, Davidson announced on his Instagram account that he had quit drugs and was sober for the first time in eight years. During an interview on comedian Marc Maron's podcast, Davidson clarified that the only drug he used was marijuana and, while he has since cut back its use considerably, the personal problems he initially assumed were a result of his daily marijuana habit were actually caused by borderline personality disorder, for which he has since been undergoing treatment.\n\nDavidson previously dated Cazzie David for two years. On June 20, 2018, Davidson confirmed that he and singer and actress Ariana Grande were engaged to be married. On October 14, 2018, it was reported that the engagement was called off. Grande's song \"Pete Davidson\" appears on her 2018 album \"Sweetener\".\n\n"}
{"id": "5432063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5432063", "title": "Richard W. Austin", "text": "Richard W. Austin\n\nRichard Wilson Austin (August 26, 1857 – April 20, 1919) was an American politician, attorney and diplomat. A Republican, he served in the United States House of Representatives from 1909 to 1919, representing Tennessee's 2nd district. Prior to his congressional tenure, he worked as a United States Marshal from 1897 to 1906, and served as the U.S. consul to Glasgow, Scotland, from 1906 to 1907.\n\nAustin was born on August 26, 1857, in Decatur, Alabama, the son of John and Mary (Parker) Austin. He attended public schools in Loudon County, Tennessee, and studied law at the University of Tennessee. He was admitted to the bar in 1878, and commenced practice in Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nAustin served as a clerk in the Post Office Department at Washington, D.C., from 1879 to 1881. He worked as Assistant Doorkeeper of the United States House of Representatives under his future political ally, Walter P. Brownlow, from 1881 to 1883, during the Forty-seventh Congress. He was a special agent of the War Department from 1883 to 1885. In 1885, he engaged in newspaper work in Knoxville. He then returned to Decatur, Alabama, and continued the practice of law. He was the private secretary of Congressman Leonidas C. Houk from Tennessee in 1888, and was the city attorney of Decatur, Alabama.\n\nAustin ran for Alabama's 8th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1890, but lost to the incumbent, former Confederate general Joseph Wheeler, 16,821 votes to 12,076. He was a delegate to the 1892 Republican National Convention at Minneapolis. He returned to Knoxville in 1893 to edit the \"Knoxville Republican\".\n\nFollowing the death of Leonidas Houk in 1891, the Tennessee Republican Party gradually split into two quarreling factions: one led by Brownlow, which Austin supported, and the other led by former congressman Henry Clay Evans of Chattanooga, which had the support of Chattanooga businessman Newell Sanders. At the 1896 Republican National Convention, Austin and Brownlow helped thwart Evans' bid for the vice presidential nomination. Brownlow was elected to Congress by the 1st district later that year. The president considered Evans for the office of Postmaster General, but the appointment went to James A. Gary of Maryland, due in part to the influence of Brownlow and Austin.\n\nIn 1897, President McKinley appointed Austin United States Marshal for the Eastern District of Tennessee. One of the more notable actions of Austin as marshal came in June 1903, when he organized an unsuccessful effort to recapture outlaw Kid Curry, who had escaped from a Knoxville jail.\n\nAustin ran for Tennessee's 2nd district congressional seat in 1904, but was defeated in the primary by Nathan W. Hale, who had the support of the Evans-Sanders block. In 1906, Austin was appointed United States consul at Glasgow, Scotland. He remained at this post until November 1907, when he resigned and returned to Tennessee to mount another congressional campaign.\n\nIn 1908, the quarrel between the Evans-Sanders and Brownlow-Austin factions intensified when powerful Knoxville businessman William J. Oliver, a friend of Brownlow and Austin, led a band of armed ruffians to the state party's convention in Nashville, where they beat up Sanders and chased away his supporters. Determined to defeat Hale, the Brownlow faction aligned itself with the Malcolm Patterson faction of the state's Democratic Party, which was facing a similar rift between supporters of Patterson and supporters of his gubernatorial opponent, Edward W. Carmack. The Brownlow Republicans offered to vote for Patterson for governor, and in return, Patterson Democrats would vote for Austin in the 2nd district congressional election. With this support, Austin edged Hale on election day, 15,337 votes to 14,528.\n\nIncensed, Hale and his supporters attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Austin from caucusing with House Republicans. John Chiles Houk, who generally supported the Evans-Sanders faction, convinced Patterson to abandon his support for Austin and Brownlow. This move proved untimely, however, as Patterson's popularity plummeted due to his actions in the aftermath of the Cooper-Carmack shootout. Though Hale had the support of Houk and the influential \"Knoxville Journal\", Austin had the support of President William Howard Taft. Following a savage campaign in 1910, Austin again defeated Hale, this time by a margin of 15,761 votes to 11,755.\n\nIn 1912, Republicans were again divided, with some remaining loyal to Taft, and others throwing their support behind Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive Party ticket. In the 2nd district congressional election, Austin remained loyal to Taft and ran on the Republican ticket. W. H. Buttram, who had the support of John Chiles Houk and Knoxville attorney Hugh B. Lindsay, ran on the Progressive ticket. J.C.J. Williams ran as a Democrat. Though Roosevelt outpolled Taft in the 2nd district, Austin was easily reelected, garnering 12,712 votes to 7,025 for Buttram, and 6,681 for Williams.\n\nAustin was easily reelected in 1914 and 1916. At the 1916 Republican National Convention, he openly squabbled with ex-Governor Ben W. Hooper (a Sanders ally) over the state's delegate to the national committee. The persistent enmity of Houk, Sanders and Hooper finally took its toll in the March 1918 Republican primary, when Austin was defeated for the nomination by state party chairman J.

In February 1911, Austin delivered a memorial address on the House floor for Brownlow, who had died the previous year. In 1915, he supported a national exchange system that would help match job seekers with employers looking for help. During the House debate on the 19th Amendment in January 1918, Austin, referring to Congressman Jeannette Rankin of Montana, argued, \"The highest, best, and strongest evidence that women's suffrage is a success has been established in this House by the enviable record made by our colleague from Montana, who has won the respect, confidence, and admiration of the members and officials of this House.\"\n\nAustin died in Washington, D.C., on April 20, 1919, just over a month after the end of his final congressional term.

He was the son of Sir John Godfrey, 2nd Baronet. He was sent to England for his education, attending Westminster School. He subsequently studied at an academy in Geneva, before embarking on the Grand Tour.\n\nDespite his cosmopolitan upbringing, Godfrey returned to Ireland following his travels in Europe, and remained in County Kerry for most of his life. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1822 and became a captain of the Milltown Infantry contingent in 1824. He was sworn in as High Sheriff of Kerry in 1829. At the insistence of his friend, Valentine Browne, 2nd Earl of Kenmare, Godfrey was made a Deputy Lieutenant for Kerry in 1832.\n\nThroughout the 1830s, Sir William Godfrey managed the estates of both his brother-in-law, John Coltsmann of Flesk Castle and that of his cousin, Arthur Blennerhassett of Ballyseedy. He was an avid farmer, and unlike many Anglo-Irish landowners, he took a keen interest in his estate and tenants. He was recognised by the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland for his promotion and use of advanced farming techniques. Politically, Godfrey aligned himself with the liberal wing of the Conservative Party, although he never stood for elected office. He was known to be sympathetic towards Catholic emancipation. During the Irish famine of the 1840s, Godfrey organised and chaired several local relief committees. In May 1846, Sir William purchased a\nlarge quantity of Indian meal to bridge the period before the first potato crops became available. He lobbied the government in London on numerous occasions, warning in October 1846 that, \"the people have endured their wants & privations with resignation and patience but if employment and relief are delayed much longer, the peace & tranquillity of this district must be seriously endangered.\"\n\nGodfrey was a stalwart and committed supporter of the established Anglican Church of Ireland although his wife, Mary Teresa, was a devout Roman Catholic.

{"id": "1932875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1932875", "title": "Three wise monkeys", "text": "Three wise monkeys\n\nThe three wise monkeys are a pictorial maxim, embodying the proverbial principle \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\". The three monkeys are Mizaru, covering his eyes, who sees no evil; Kikazaru, covering his ears, who hears no evil; and Iwazaru, covering his mouth, who speaks no evil. Lafcadio Hearn refers to them as the three mystic apes in his \"Glimpses of unfamiliar Japan\" (volume 2, page 127).\n\nThere are various meanings ascribed to the monkeys and the proverb including associations with being of good mind, speech and action. In the Western world the phrase is often used to refer to those who deal with impropriety by turning a blind eye. \n\nOutside Japan the monkeys' names are sometimes given as \"Mizaru\", \"Mikazaru\", and \"Mazaru\", as the last two names were corrupted from the Japanese originals. The monkeys are Japanese macaques, a common species in Japan.\n\nThe source that popularized this pictorial maxim is a 17th-century carving over a door of the famous Tōshō-gū shrine in Nikkō, Japan. The carvings at Tōshō-gū Shrine were carved by Hidari Jingoro, and believed to have incorporated Confucius’s Code of Conduct, using the monkey as a way to depict man’s life cycle. There are a total of eight panels, and the iconic three wise monkeys picture comes from panel 2. The philosophy, however, probably originally came to Japan with a Tendai-Buddhist legend, from China in the 8th century (Nara Period). It has been suggested that the figures represent the three dogmas of the so-called middle school of the sect.\n\nIn Chinese, a similar phrase exists in the late \"Analects of Confucius\" from 2nd to 4th century B.C.: \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety\" (). It may be that this phrase was shortened and simplified after it was brought into Japan.\n\nIt is through the Kōshin rite of folk religion that the most significant examples are presented. The Kōshin belief or practice is a Japanese folk religion with Chinese Taoism origins and ancient Shinto influence. It was founded by Tendai Buddhist monks in the late 10th century. A considerable number of stone monuments can be found all over the eastern part of Japan around Tokyo. During the later part of the Muromachi period, it was customary to display stone pillars depicting the three monkeys during the observance of Kōshin.\n\nThough the teaching had nothing to do with monkeys, the concept of the three monkeys originated from a simple play on words. The saying in Japanese is , where the \"-zaru\" is a negative conjugation on the three verbs, matching \"zaru\", the modified form of \"monkey\" used in compounds. Thus the saying (which does not include any specific reference to \"evil\") can also be interpreted as referring to three monkeys.\n\nThe shrine at Nikko is a Shinto shrine, and the monkey is an extremely important being in the Shinto religion. The monkey is believed to be the messenger of the Hie Shinto shrines, which also have connections with Tendai Buddhism. There are even important festivals that are celebrated during the year of the Monkey (occurring every twelve years) and a special festival is celebrated every sixteenth year of the Kōshin.\n\n\"The Three Mystic Apes\" (Sambiki Saru) were described as \"the attendants of Saruta Hito no Mikoto or Kōshin, the God of the Roads\". The Kōshin festival was held on the 60th day of the calendar. It has been suggested that during the Kōshin festival, according to old beliefs, one’s bad deeds might be reported to heaven \"unless avoidance actions were taken…\". It has been theorized that the three Mystic Apes, Not Seeing, Hearing, or Speaking, may have been the \"things that one has done wrong in the last 59 days\".\n\nAccording to other accounts, the monkeys caused the \"Sanshi\" and \"Ten-Tei\" not to see, say or hear the bad deeds of a person. The are the Three Corpses living in everyone's body. The Sanshi keep track of the good deeds and particularly the bad deeds of the person they inhabit. Every 60 days, on the night called , if the person sleeps, the Sanshi will leave the body and go to , the Heavenly God, to report about the deeds of that person. Ten-Tei will then decide to punish bad people, making them ill, shortening their time alive, and in extreme cases putting an end to their lives. Those believers of Kōshin who have reason to fear will try to stay awake during Kōshin nights. This is the only way to prevent the Sanshi from leaving their body and reporting to Ten-Tei.\n\nAn ancient representation of the \"no see, no hear, no say, no do\" can be found in four golden figurines in the Zelnik Istvan Southeast Asian Gold Museum. These golden statues date from the 6th to 8th century. The figures look like tribal human people with not very precise body carvings and strong phallic symbols. This set indicates that the philosophy comes from very ancient roots.\n\nIt is not clear how or when the saying travelled; in Ethiopia the Ge'ez language has the saying \"Let the eye fast, let the mouth fast, let the ears fast.\"\n\nJust as there is disagreement about the origin of the phrase, there are differing explanations of the meaning of \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\".\n\nSometimes there is a fourth monkey depicted, Shizaru, who symbolizes the principle of \"do no evil\", which fits with the full quote from Analects of Confucius. The monkey may be shown crossing his arms or covering his genitals. Yet another variation has the fourth monkey hold its nose to avoid a stench and has been dubbed \"smell no evil\" accordingly.\n\nAccording to Osho Rajneesh, the monkey symbolism originated in ancient Hindu tradition and Buddhist monks spread this symbolism across Asia. The original Hindu and Buddhist version has four monkeys and the fourth monkey covers his genitals.The Buddhist version means this as \"Don't do anything evil\".\n\nIn Hindu original version the meaning of the fourth monkey is totally different from the popular Buddhist version. It means, \"Hide your pleasures. Hide your enjoyment, don't show it to anybody.\"\n\nOsho Rajneesh gave his own meaning regarding this. The first monkey denotes 'Don't listen to the truth because it will disturb all your consoling lies'. The second monkey denotes 'Don't look at the truth; otherwise your God will be dead and your heaven and hell will disappear'. The third monkey denotes 'Don't speak the truth, otherwise you will be condemned, crucified, poisoned, tortured by the whole crowd, the unconscious people. The fourth monkey denotes \"Keep your pleasures, your joys, hidden. Don't let anybody know that you are a cheerful man, a blissful man, an ecstatic man, because that will destroy your very life. It is dangerous\".\n\nThe three wise monkeys, and the associated proverb, are known throughout Asia and in the Western world. They have been a motif in pictures, such as the ukiyo-e (Japanese woodblock printings) by Keisai Eisen, and are frequently represented in modern culture.\n\nMahatma Gandhi's one notable exception to his lifestyle of non-possession was a small statue of the three monkeys - Bapu, Ketan and Bandar. Today, a larger representation of the three monkeys is prominently displayed at the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, where Gandhi lived from 1915 to 1930 and from where he departed on his famous salt march. Gandhi's statue also inspired a 2008 artwork by Subodh Gupta, \"Gandhi's Three Monkeys\". \n\nThe three monkeys are depicted in the trial scene in the 1968 \"Planet of the Apes\". An example of semiotics, as the judges mimic the see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil monkeys.\n\nThe maxim inspired an award-winning 2008 Turkish film by director Nuri Bilge Ceylan called \"Three Monkeys\" (\"Üç Maymun\").\nUnicode provides emoji representations of the monkeys in the Emoticons block as follows:\n\n\n\n"}

He is the only companion who is mentioned by name in the Qur'an ().\n\nZayd is said to have been ten years younger than Muhammad, suggesting a birth-year of c. 581 A.D.. He is also said to have been 55 (lunar) years old at his death in 629, indicating a birthdate of 576.\n\nHe was born into the Udhra branch of the Kalb tribe in the Najd (central) Arabia; he claimed a pedigree twelfth in descent from Udhra ibn Zayd al-Lat ibn Rufayda ibn Thawr ibn Kalb ibn Wabara.<ref name=\"Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6\">Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6.</ref> Zayd's mother, Suda bint Thaalaba, was from the Maan branch of the Tayy tribe.<ref name=\"Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6\">Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 6.</ref>\n\nWhen Zayd was \"a young boy of an age at which he could be a servant\" he accompanied his mother on a visit to her family. While they were staying with the Maan tribe, horsemen from the Qayn tribe raided their tents and kidnapped Zayd. They took him to the market at Ukkaz and sold him as a slave for 400 \"dinars \".\n\nZayd's family searched for him, but without success. A lament is attributed to his father, Harithah ibn Sharahil:\n\n<poem>\"I weep for Zayd, not knowing what became of him.\"\n\"Is he alive, is he to be expected, or has Death come over him?\"\n\"By God, I ask yet do not comprehend.\"\n\"Was it the plain or the mountain that brought about your end?\"\n\"I wish that I knew: Will you ever return?\"\n\"In this world only for your coming back I yearn.\"\n\"The sun reminds me of him when it dawns, evoking his memory as the dusk falls.\"\n\"When the winds blow, they stir up memories like dust.\"\n\"O how long my sorrow and fear for him last!\"</poem>\n\nZaid was purchased by a merchant of Mecca, Hakim ibn Hizam, who gave the boy as a present to his aunt, Khadijah bint Khuwaylid. He remained in her possession until the day she married Muhammad , when she gave the slave as a wedding present to her bridegroom. Muhammad became very attached to Zaid, to whom he referred as \"al-Habib\" (\"the beloved\").\n\nSome years later, some members of Zaid's tribe happened to arrive in Mecca on pilgrimage. They encountered Zaid and recognised each other, and he asked them to take a message home. \n\nOn receiving this message, Zaid's father and uncle immediately set out for Mecca. They found Muhammad at the Kaaba and promised him any ransom if he would return Zaid to them. Muhammad replied that Zaid should be allowed to choose his fate, but that if he wished to return to his family, Muhammad would release him without accepting any ransom in exchange. They called for Zaid, who easily recognised his father and uncle, but told them that he did not want to leave Muhammad, \"for I have seen something in this man, and I am not the kind of person who would ever choose anyone in preference to him.\" At this, Muhammad took Zaid to the steps of the Kaaba, where legal contracts were agreed and witnessed, and announced to the crowds: \"Witness that Zaid becomes my son, with mutual rights of inheritance.\" On seeing this, Zaid's father and uncle \"were satisfied,\" and they returned home without him.\n\nIn accordance with the Arabic custom of adoption at the time, Zayd was thereafter known as \"Zayd ibn Muhammad\" and was a freedman, regarded socially and legally as Muhammad's son.<ref name=\"Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 9\">Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 9.</ref>\n\nAt an unknown date before 610, Zayd accompanied Muhammad to Ta'if, where it was a tradition to sacrifice meat to the idols. Near Baldah on their way back to Mecca, they met Zayd ibn Amr and offered him some of the cooked meat that Zayd was carrying in their bag. Zayd ibn Amr, an outspoken monotheist, replied, \"I do not eat anything which you slaughter in the name of your stone idols. I eat none but those things on which Allah's Name has been mentioned at the time of slaughtering.\" After this encounter, said Muhammad, \"I never stroked an idol of theirs, nor did I sacrifice to them, until God honoured me with his apostleship.\"\n\nWhen Muhammad reported in 610 that he had received a revelation from the angel Gabriel, Zayd was one of the first converts to Islam. While Khadijah was the first Muslim of all, she was closely followed by her neighbour Lubaba bint al-Harith, her four daughters, and the first male converts, Ali, Zayd and Abu Bakr.\n\nIn 622, Zayd joined the other Muslims in the \"Hijra\" to Medina. Once settled in the new city, Muhammad urged each Muslim to \"take a brother in Religion\" so that each would have an ally in the community. Zayd was paired with Muhammad's uncle Hamza. Hamza accordingly trusted his last testament to Zayd just before his death in 625.\n\nA few months later, Muhammad and Abu Bakr sent Zayd back to Mecca to escort their families to Medina. The return party consisted of Muhammad's wife Sawda, his daughters Umm Kulthum and Fatimah, his servant Abu Rafi, Zayd's wife Baraka and their son Usama, Abu Bakr's wife Umm Rumman, his children Asma, Abdullah and Aisha, and a guide named Abdullah ibn Urayqit; and Abu Bakr's kinsman Talhah also decided to accompany them.\n\nZayd married at least six times.\n\nZayd had three children.\n\nAround 625 Muhammad proposed that his cousin, Zaynab bint Jahsh, should marry Zayd. At first she refused on the grounds that she was of the Quraysh. It has been suggested that differences between Zaynab's social status and Zayd's were precisely the reason why Muhammad wanted to arrange the marriage:\n\nThe Prophet was well aware that it is a person's standing in the eyes of Allah that is important, rather than his or her status in the eyes of the people ... their marriage would demonstrate that it was not who their ancestors were, but rather their standing in the sight of Allah, that mattered.\n\nBy contrast, Montgomery Watt points out that Zayd was high in Muhammad's esteem.\n\nShe can hardly have thought that he was not good enough. She was an ambitious woman, however, and may already have hoped to marry Muhammad; or she may have wanted to marry someone with whom Muhammad did not want his family to be so closely allied.\n\nWhen Muhammad announced a new verse of the Qur'an,\n\nZaynab acquiesced and married Zayd.\n\nThe marriage lasted less than two years. According to Ibn Sa`d and al-Tabari \n\nZayd bin Harithah, who lived in Muhammad's household and came to be regarded as his adoptive son-so that he was regularly addressed as Zayd, son of Muhammad. Whether the marriage between Zayd and Zaynab was a mesalliance from the beginning is speculation, though the account maintains that Zayd was not reluctant to divorce his wife and allow her to marry Muhammad. Muhammad is portrayed as reluctant to proceed with the marriage because of scruples about whether marrying one's adopted son's former wife violated the prohibited degrees of marriage. Arab customary practice recognized kinship relations not based on blood ties: fosterage (having nursed from the same woman) was one such relationship; the question whether adoption fell into this category must have been unclear among Muslims. The marriage did not take place until after a Qur'anic revelation was received, giving permission for believers to marry the divorced wives of their adopted sons. \n\nAfter these events, the traditional Arab form of adoption was no longer recognized in Islam; it was replaced by \"kafala\". Three verses of the Qur'an were written about this. Al-Tabari states that Q33:40 was revealed because \"the Munafiqun made this a topic of their conversation and reviled the Prophet, saying 'Muhammad prohibits [marriage] with the [former] wives of one's own sons, but he married the [former] wife of his son Zayd.'\"\n\nZayd reverted to being known by his original name of Zayd ibn Harithah and was no longer considered Muhammad's legal son after the revelation of Q33:5:\n\nIbn Saad indicates that Q33:37 was a specific instruction to Muhammad and Zaynab to marry and that it explains why their marriage was necessary.\n\nZayd was \"one of the famous archers among the Prophet's Companions.\"<ref name=\"Landau-Tasseron/Tabari p. 10\">Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, \"Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk\", vol. 39. Translated by Landau-Tasseron, E. (1998). \"Biographies of the Prophet's Companions and Their Successors\", p. 10. New York: State University of New York Press.</ref> He fought at Badr, Uhud, Trench and Khaybar, and was present at the expedition to Hudaybiyyah. When Muhammad raided Al-Muraysi, he left Zayd behind as governor in Medina.\n\nZayd commanded seven military expeditions.\n\nAccording to Aisha, \"The Messenger of Allah did not ever send Zayd ibn Haritha in an army without putting him in command of it, even if he stayed after he appointed him.\"\n\nZayd ibn Harithah led his final expedition in September 629 C.E. A Muslim force of 3,000 men set out to raid the Byzantine city of Bosra. However, a Byzantine force of \"100,000 Greeks joined by 100,000 men from Lakhm and Judham and Al-Qayn and Bahra' and Bali\" intercepted them at a village called Mu'tah. Zayd held the standard at the Battle of Mu'tah until he was struck down by a spear-thrust<ref name=\"Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 33\">Bewley/Saad vol. 3 p. 33</ref> and he bled to death. The other two leaders, Ja`far ibn Abī Tālib and `Abd Allah ibn Rawahah, were also killed, and the Muslim army was routed.\n\nOn hearing of Zayd's death, Muhammad went to the family. \"The daughter of Zayd wept before the Messenger of Allah and the Messenger of Allah wept until he sobbed.
