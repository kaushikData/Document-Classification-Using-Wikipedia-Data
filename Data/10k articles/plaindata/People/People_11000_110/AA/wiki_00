Selected with the 25th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft, Harrington played 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Indiana Pacers, Atlanta Hawks, Golden State Warriors, New York Knicks, Denver Nuggets, Orlando Magic and Washington Wizards. He also spent a short stint with the Fujian Sturgeons of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA).\n\nSince retiring from the NBA, Harrington has become an entrepreneur in the cannabis industry. Harrington is a cousin of NBA player Dahntay Jones.\n\nBorn in Orange, New Jersey, Harrington grew up in Roselle, New Jersey and played high school basketball at St. Patrick High School in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was named both Gatorade and USA Today's National Player of the Year, as well as a 1998 McDonald's High School All-American after his senior season.\n\nAt only 18 years of age, Harrington was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 25th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft, and spent six seasons with them, primarily coming off the bench. Harrington really began to come into his own in the 2001–02 season, in which he averaged 13.1 points and 6.3 rebounds per game, but his season came to an end in a game against the Boston Celtics when he suffered a knee injury that forced him to miss the final 38 games of the season.\n\nHe made a comeback in the 2002–03 season, becoming the only Pacer to play in all 82 games that year. He averaged 12.2 points and 6.0 rebounds per game while starting in 37 games. The following season, he boosted his averages slightly to 13.3 points and 6.4 rebounds per game, and finished second in voting for the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award. He was an integral part of the Pacers' first run to the Eastern Conference Finals since 2000.\n\nOn July 15, 2004, Harrington was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Stephen Jackson. Harrington finally became a nightly starter, but the Hawks did not fare as successfully as the Pacers did after his departure.\n\nOn August 22, 2006, Harrington and John Edwards were acquired by the Indiana Pacers from the Atlanta Hawks in a sign-and-trade deal that also sent the Hawks a 2007 first round draft pick. In 2006–07, Harrington wore jersey #32 because his first choice #3 was worn by teammate Šarūnas Jasikevičius (saying it stands for \"number three, and it's my second time around\").\n\nOn January 17, 2007, Harrington was dealt to the Golden State Warriors along with teammates Stephen Jackson, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, and Josh Powell for Troy Murphy, Mike Dunleavy, Ike Diogu, and Keith McLeod.\n\nOn November 21, 2008, Harrington was traded to the New York Knicks in exchange for Jamal Crawford. In his two seasons with the Knicks, he played the best basketball of his career, but did not reach the playoffs in either season. In 140 games (66 starts), he averaged 19.2 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.0 steals in 32.7 minutes per game.\n\nOn July 15, 2010, Harrington signed a multi-year deal with the Denver Nuggets. During the 2010–11 season, he averaged 10.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.4 assists in 22.8 minutes per game. The Nuggets finished 50–32, fifth best in the Western Conference and second in the Northwest Division. The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Nuggets in five games in the first round of the 2011 playoffs.\n\nOn August 10, 2012, Harrington was traded to the Orlando Magic in a four-team trade which sent Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers. He only played 10 games for the Magic in 2012–13, averaging 5.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 1.0 assists in 11.7 minutes per game. The Magic finished with a 20-62 record, the worst record in the NBA. On August 2, 2013, Harrington was waived by the Magic.\n\nOn August 14, 2013, Harrington signed with the Washington Wizards. He came off the bench in all 37 games he played for Washington, averaging 6.6 points and 2.4 rebounds per contest. The Wizards made their first playoff appearance since 2008, and Harrington played in 7 of the team's 11 postseason games.\n\nOn August 11, 2014, Harrington signed with the Fujian Sturgeons of the Chinese Basketball Association. On November 25, 2014, he parted ways with Fujian amidst NBA interest.\n\nAfter returning to the United States and not receiving any NBA offers, Harrington announced his retirement from professional basketball on March 18, 2015, after averaging 13.5 points and 5.6 rebounds in a 16-year career that included stints with seven teams.\n\nHarrington later came out of retirement and signed with the Sydney Kings of the National Basketball League on October 28, 2015 as an injury replacement for Josh Childress. He made his debut for the Kings two days later, scoring 12 points off the bench in an 87–78 win over the Townsville Crocodiles. With Childress set to return from injury, Harrington played his last game with Sydney on November 19, recording 18 points and 6 rebounds in a loss to the New Zealand Breakers. In six games for the Kings, he averaged 17.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Harrington competed in the inaugural season of the Big3 basketball league. He played for Trilogy and served as co-captain with former teammate Kenyon Martin. The team went an undefeated 10-0 that season, winning the first-ever Big3 Championship. \n\nAfter retiring from the NBA, Harrington started a business that produces cannabis extracts. The company, Viola Extracts, is named after Harrington's grandmother who uses cannabis. Suffering from glaucoma and diabetes, she tried cannabis at the urging of Harrington and found significant relief. The company cultivates cannabis in-house and has facilities in several states.\n\nIn February 2018 Harrington announced the launch of Harrington Wellness, a company that manufactures non-psychoactive cannabinoid products. Also announced was his investment in a third company Butter Baby, which makes cannabis edibles. All three companies together comprise The Harrington Group.\n\nHarrington is a proponent for the legalization of cannabis. In October 2016, he appeared in an online ad endorsing the passage of California's Proposition 64. He has also written an essay for \"The Players' Tribune\" titled \"9 Reasons to End the War on Marijuana\".\n\nIn October 2017, Harrington interviewed former NBA commissioner David Stern regarding cannabis use by players. Stern told Harrington during the interview: \"I'm now at the point where personally I think [cannabis] probably should be removed from the banned list. You've persuaded me.\"\n\n\n"}

He matriculated at the University of Cambridge in 1859, being admitted to Pembroke College, where he was a scholar. After graduating with a bachelor of arts degree as 21st wrangler in 1863, he trained in astronomy under John Couch Adams at a local observatory. In 1866, he was invited to oversee the construction of the Great Melbourne Telescope at the Grubb factory in Dublin. Le Sueur wrote that he felt he had little \"special knowledge\" in the field of astronomy, but would endeavour to prove himself capable to his clients. In the meantime, he was coached in celestial photography by Warren de la Rue and immersed himself in the intricacies of building the telescope. In 1868, he supervised its transportation to and erection in Melbourne; despite being a talented astronomer, drawer and photographer, he clashed with the telescope's director and returned home in 1870. Le Sueur's observations were amongst preliminary attempts at using astronomical spectroscopy. After returning to Jersey, the remaining trajectory of his life is largely unclear and it does appear that he made further observations. He married in 1875 and died on 25 April 1906, aged 58.\n"}
{"id": "425823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425823", "title": "Alice Bailey", "text": "Alice Bailey\n\nAlice Ann Bailey (June 16, 1880 – December 15, 1949) was a writer of more than twenty-four books on theosophical subjects, and was one of the first writers to use the term New Age. Bailey was born as Alice La Trobe-Bateman, in Manchester, England. She moved to the United States in 1907, where she spent most of her life as a writer and teacher.\n\nBailey's works, written between 1919 and 1949, describe a wide-ranging system of esoteric thought covering such topics as how spirituality relates to the Solar System, meditation, healing, spiritual psychology, the destiny of nations, and prescriptions for society in general. She described the majority of her work as having been telepathically dictated to her by a Master of Wisdom, initially referred to only as \"the Tibetan\" or by the initials \"D.K.\", later identified as Djwal Khul. Her writings bore some similarity to those of Madame Blavatsky and are among the teachings often referred to as the \"Ageless Wisdom\". Though Bailey's writings differ in some respects to the Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky, they have much in common with it. She wrote on religious themes, including Christianity, though her writings are fundamentally different from many aspects of Christianity or other orthodox religions. Her vision of a unified society included a global \"spirit of religion\" different from traditional religious forms and including the concept of the Age of Aquarius.\n\nBailey was born to a wealthy middle class British family and, as a member of the Anglican Church, received a thorough Christian education.\n\nHer autobiography states that at the age 15, on June 30, 1895, Bailey was visited by a stranger, \"... a tall man, dressed in European clothes and wearing a turban\" who told her she needed to develop self-control to prepare for certain work he planned for her to do. This turned out to be the creation and publication of 19 books together with educational and meditation work that reached into \"practically all the countries of the world\". (p. 63-64)\n\nAt the age of 22, Bailey did evangelical work in connection with the YMCA and the British Army. This took her to India where, in 1907, she met her future husband Walter Evans. Together they moved to America where Evans became an Episcopalian priest. The marriage did not last and Bailey pushed for and received a divorce. She left with their three children after formal separation in 1915. Then followed a difficult period in which she worked in a sardine factory to support herself and the children.\n\nBailey discovered the Theosophical Society and the work of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. The Theosophical Society states that Bailey became involved in 1917. Theosophist Joy Mills states that in 1918 she became a member of the Esoteric Section of the society. Theosophist Bruce F. Campbell notes, \"She quickly rose to a position of influence in the American Section of the Adyar society, moving to its headquarters at Krotona in Hollywood. She became editor of its magazine, \"The Messenger,\" and member of the committee responsible for Krotona.\" In 1919, Foster Bailey (1888–1977), who was to be her second husband, became National Secretary of the Theosophical Society. They married in 1921.\n\nThe Theosophist published the first few chapters of her first work, \"Initiation, Human and Solar,\" (p. 762) but then stopped for reasons Bailey called \"theosophical jealousy and reactionary attitude\". Bailey \"objected to the 'neo-Theosophy' of Annie Besant\" and worked with Foster Bailey to gain more power in the American Section. According to Theosophist Josephine Maria Davies Ransom, she became part of a progressive \"Back to Blavatsky movement, led mainly by Mr. and Mrs. Foster Bailey\". She outlined her vision for the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society; however, her efforts to influence the society failed, and she and her husband were dismissed from their positions.\n\nAccording to historian of religion Olav Hammer, Bailey's early writings of communications with the Tibetan were well received within the society, but society president Annie Besant questioned Bailey's claims of communications with \"the Tibetan\" and allowed the Baileys to be expelled from the organization. According to Bailey, she had come to see the society as authoritarian and involved with \"lower psychic phenomena\".\n\nAlice and Foster Bailey founded the Lucis Trust in 1922. Its activities include the Arcane School, World Goodwill, Triangles, a quarterly magazine called The Beacon, and a publishing company primarily intended to publish Bailey's many books. The Arcane School gives instruction and guidance in meditation, via correspondence, based on the ideas in Bailey's books. World Goodwill is intended to promote better human relations through goodwill which they define as \"love in action\". That \"action\" included support of the United Nations. The \"Triangles\" are groups of three people who agree to link up in thought each day and to meditate on right human relations, visualising light and love pouring into human minds and hearts, followed by the use of the Great Invocation. It is not necessary for each person to link in thought at the same time each day and need only take a few moments of time.\n\nAlice and Foster Bailey founded, \"Lucifer Publishing Company\". (\"'Lucifer' and 'Lucis' come from the same word root, \"lucis\" being the Latin genitive case meaning \"of light\".\" After the first two or three years, the name was changed to \"Lucis Publishing Co.\" (The Theosophical Society also used the name \"Lucifer\" for its early magazine.) In 1923, with the help of Foster Bailey, Alice Bailey founded the Arcane School, which is part of Lucis Trust. This school provides educational correspondence, meditation instruction, and guided study based on her writings.\n\nBailey continued to work up to the time of her death in 1949.\n\nBailey's writings includes a detailed exposition of the \"seven rays\" which are presented as the fundamental energies that are behind and exist throughout all manifestation. They are seen as the basic creative forces of the universe and emanations of Divinity that underlie the evolution of all things. The rays are described as related to human psychology, the destiny of nations, as well as the planets and stars of the heavens. The concept of the seven rays can be found in Theosophical works. Campbell writes that Bailey, \"... was the first to develop the idea of the seven rays, although it can be found in germ in earlier Theosophical writings.\" The seven rays also appear in Hindu religious philosophy.\n\nEsoteric astrology is part of Alice Bailey's \"Ageless Wisdom\" teachings, which she said were relayed by her Tibetan Master Djwhal Khul.\n\nThe esoteric astrologers who follow the teachings of Bailey typically base their work on her five-volume \"Treatise on the Seven Rays\", particularly volume three which focuses on astrology. Her esoteric astrology deals with the evolution of soul consciousness and the obstacles to that evolution.\n\nBailey's teaching on healing primarily concerns the relationship of soul to personality, of the spiritual to the material nature. In her view, all disease has its ultimate root in some type of blocked or inhibited soul life. Therefore, healing consists of releasing the soul, that is the establishing of a right relation between the soul and the personality where the personality is defined as the instrument of soul expression.\n\nIn line with previous Theosophical teachings, Bailey taught that man consists of\nEach of the three aspects of the lower nature is described as a \"body\" or aura of energy and seen as partial expression of the real self or soul. The soul is regarded as the real self that works through or uses the three aspects of personality. She also speaks of these as \"vehicles\" or \"sheaths\", and alternately as the \"mental body\", \"astral body\", or \"physical body\". The \"etheric\" body is most directly related to physical health and is seen as the vital energizing agent for the individual while in physical incarnation. (p. 172) (p. 33) See also: Subtle body. The mind and emotional nature are seen as auras. or energy fields of which brain activity is a secondary effect. (p. 411)\n\nThe \"Great Invocation\" is a mantra given in 1937 by Bailey. The mantra begins with \"From the point of Light within the Mind of God, let light stream forth into the minds of men ...\" with the rest of the passage expressing the ideas of love, the return of The Christ (Maitreya) and of men acting in accordance with the plan of God.\n\nIt is well known by some followers of the New Age movement, where it is widely used as part of meditation, particularly in groups. For instance, the invocation has been used in the Findhorn Foundation community since the 1970s. In response to the September 11 attacks (2001), the Great Invocation was used as a central element of a new daily program at Findhorn known as the \"Network of Light meditations for peace\". Rosemary Keller described the Great Invocation as a call for \"the Christ to return to Earth\" and wrote that Bailey-related groups purchased radio and television time to broadcast the invocation as part of their mission, and that often the invocation was recited in what Keller called \"light groups\", to accomplish what Bailey's disciples considered to be attracting and focusing \"spiritual energies to benefit the planet\".\n\nAlice Bailey's writings have a theme that generally advocates replacement of the old with the new and this occurs in connection with the Great Invocation as follows: \"This new Invocation, if given widespread distribution, can be to the new world religion what the Lord's Prayer has been to Christianity and the 23rd Psalm has been to the spiritually minded Jew.\"\n\nResearcher Hannah Newman described what she found to be an antisemitic element in the Great Invocation. According to Newman, \"the Plan\" named in the invocation refers to the plan authored by \"the Hierarchy\", that Newman states places \"high priority on removing all Jewish presence and influence from human consciousness, a goal to be achieved by eliminating Judaism.\"\n\nBailey's writings downplayed traditional devotional and religious aspects of the spiritual life, in favor of a life of meditation, service to humanity, and cooperation with \"the Plan of the Hierarchy\". In her thinking, service, \"... is a soul instinct ... innate and peculiar to soul unfoldment. It is the outstanding characteristic of the soul, just as desire is the outstanding characteristic of the lower nature ...\"\n\nRoss describes Bailey's teachings as emphasizing the \"underlying unity of all forms of life\", and the \"essential oneness of all religions, of all departments of science, and of all the philosophies\". Campbell notes that the New Group of World Servers was established for \"... promotion of international understanding, economic sharing, and religious unity\".\n\nTheosophists are divided on their assessment of Alice Bailey's writings. For instance, the noted contemporary Theosophical writer Geoffrey Hodson wrote a highly favorable review of one her books, saying, \"Once more Alice Bailey has placed occult students in her debt.\" Olav Hammer writes, \"Her first book, \"Initiation Human and Solar,\" was at first favorably received by her fellow theosophists. Soon, however, her claims to be recipient of ageless wisdom from the Masters met with opposition.\" The conflict is understandable since her works contain some criticisms of Theosophy, and at the time of the break she voiced her criticism of what she saw as dogmatic structures within the society, while questioning the pledges of loyalty to Theosophical leaders that were required. \"During the annual convention of 1920 in Chicago, there was a power struggle between forces loyal to Besant and the Esoteric Section and others who believed that the latter had become too powerful. Below the surface was a hidden controversy regarding Alice's work with the Tibetan.\" For a more recent example of Bailey/Theosophy division, see Theosophy in Scandinavia.\n\nCampbell writes that Bailey's books are a reworking of major Theosophical themes, with some distinctive emphases, and that they present a comprehensive system of esoteric science and occult philosophy, cognizant of contemporary social and political developments. Steven J. Sutcliffe points out that both Bailey and Blavatsky's work evoke a picture of Tibet as the spiritual home of the Masters and that Bailey claimed a more-or-less direct lineage to Blavatsky. He describes Bailey as a 'post-Theosophical' theorist, reporting that Bailey received instruction from \"former personal pupils of Blavatsky\" and notes that her third book (\"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire\") not only reproduces Blavatsky's apocryphal Stanzas of Dzyan but is dedicated to Blavatsky, as well.\n\nParallels between Theosophy and Bailey are many, for instance, one principle of Theosophy, the Law of Attraction was discussed in esoteric writings by Blavatsky, Annie Besant, William Quan Judge, and others; and was also discussed in the writings of Alice Bailey, including a whole chapter in one of her books. The term has been embraced, in a simplified form, by the contemporary New Age movement and was popularized in the 2006 film \"The Secret\".\n\nJon Klimo, in \"Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources\", writes, \"As with Blavatsky/Theosophical material, and more recent contemporary channeled material from other sources, we find in the Bailey work the same occult cosmological hierarchy: physical, etheric, astral, mental, causal, and higher inhabited levels of existence.\" Olav Hammer, in the book \"Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age\", highlights Bailey's Theosophical similarities as well as noting what he thinks are some differences between them: \"To a large extent, Bailey's teachings are a restatement and amplification of theosophy of the \"Secret Doctrine.\" Bailey inherited from Blavatsky and Leadbeater a predilection for profuse details and complex classificatory schemes. ... Her books have also introduced shifts in emphasis as well as new doctrinal elements.\"\n\nSome Theosophical critics have contended that there are major differences between Bailey's ideas and the Theosophy of Blavatsky, such as Bailey's embrace of some mystical Christian terms and concepts and her acceptance of Charles Webster Leadbeater.\n\nNicholas Weeks, writing for the Theosophical magazine \"Fohat\" in 1997, felt Bailey's assertion that \"... her teachings are grounded in and do not oppose in any fundamental way Theosophy as lived and taught by HPB and her Gurus\" was false. Her books are in fact \"rooted in the pseudo-theosophy pioneered by C. W. Leadbeater.\" He stated Bailey accepted Leadbeater's \"fantasy\" of the return of Christ and disparaged Bailey's \"Great Invocation\", a prayer supposed to \"induce Christ and his Masters to leave their hidden ashrams [and] enter into major cities\" to lead the Aquarian Age. This contrasts with the Theosophy of Blavatsky, he says, which emphasizes reliance on \"the Christos principle within each person\". However, Nicholas Weeks' thesis would seem to be, in part, contrary to statements where Bailey emphasized the Christos principle in each person, e.g.: \"The Christ of history and the Christ in the human heart are planetary facts.\"\n\nBailey described a concept of racial differentiation that posited a division of humanity into races that are on different levels in a \"ladder of evolution\". These '\"races\" do not represent a national or physical type but a stage of evolution. For example, she states that the Aryan root race (or '5th race'), is an \"emerging new race\" and so a relative new evolutionary phenomena. The term \"Aryan\" as used by her has a different meaning than a separative or racist use of the word. She stated that this newer type is forming in every land but primarily in lands where Caucasian peoples are found and indicates a culture where thought or intellect is dominant. Bailey considered the Aryan race to be determined by a state of consciousness rather than by genetic or racial traits. She stated that as evolution proceeds, things are accelerated and humanity will soon be predominantly distinguished by the Aryan consciousness. \"I speak not in terms of the Aryan race as it is generally understood today or in its Nordic implications.\"\n\nIn her book \"Education in the New Age\", Bailey made predictions about the use of this esoteric racial concept in the schools of the future and that these schools would incorporate the idea of \"root races\". These \"races\" are a way of conceptualizing evolution as it occurs over vast prehistoric spans of time, and during which humanity developed body (Lemurian), emotion (Atlantean), and mind (Aryan). She states that there is now being developed a \"new race\" with a spiritual dimension that expresses as \"group qualities and consciousness and idealistic vision\". However, she stated that this new development may take many thousands of years and may therefore not be the quick advance some of her New Age followers wish for. In her \"The Destiny of the Nations\", Bailey described a process by which this \"new race\" will evolve, after which \"very low grade human bodies will disappear, causing a general shift in the racial types toward a higher standard.\" For Bailey, the evolution of humanity was intimately bound up with its relationship to this Spiritual Hierarchy. She believed that the influences of religions, philosophies, sciences, educational movements, and human culture in general are the result of this relationship.\n\nBailey's sometimes elusive and abstract ideas on the races are perhaps more clear in following passage in which she address the phenomena of mixing of races.\n\nfrom page 222 of her book, \"Esoteric Healing\" and it provides context for the criticisms that follow.\n\n... Inter-marriage between nations and races, the fusion of bloods for hundreds of years—due to migration, travel, education and mental unity—has led to there being no really pure racial types today. This is far more certainly the case than the most enlightened think, if the long, long history of mankind is considered. Sexual intercourse knows no impenetrable barriers, and people today have in them all the strains and the blood of all the races, and this (as a result of the world war, 1914–1945) will be increasingly the case. This development is definitely a part of the divine plan, no matter how undesirable it may appear to those who idealize purity of relationship ... Something intended is being brought about and it cannot be avoided.\n\nBailey's ideas about race were criticized by Victor Shnirelman, a cultural anthropologist and ethnographer, who in a survey of modern Neopaganism in Russia, drew particular attention to \"... groups [that] take an extremely negative view of multi-culturalism, object to the 'mixture' of kinds, [and] support isolationism and the prohibition of immigration.\" Shnirelman saw some of Bailey's ideas on race as similar to the racism he perceived in the writing of Julius Evola, saying that \"... racist and antisemitic trends are explicit, for example, in the occult teachings of Alice Bailey and her followers, who wish to cleanse Christianity of its \"Jewish inheritance\" and reject the \"Jewish Bible\" as a prerequisite for entering the Age of Aquarius.\"\n\nShnirelman's view was echoed by Isaac Lubelsky who criticized not only Bailey, but Blavatsky, Steiner, and others. In Lubelsky's view, racists ideas were common to the whole \"Theosophical family\".\n\nMonica Sjöö, a Swedish painter, writer and a radical anarcho/eco-feminist wrote that Bailey, through her published teachings, had a \"reactionary and racist influence on the whole New Age movement.\" She also noted what she called Bailey's (and Theosophy's) \"pro-fascist religious views\", such as the belief in a secret elite of \"Masters\" who influence world events and human minds through occult means and attempt to bring about the evolution of an Aryan race (although this is an understandably modern misunderstanding of her teaching – 'Aryan' as used by Bailey is easily confused with the modern terminology, and the \"Masters\" are not an elite, but instead are 'enlightened' individuals originally introduced in theosophy as having evolved beyond the human or \"4th kingdom\" into the fifth or \"Kingdom of souls\", and who – in her view – guide the human race as a whole).\n\nControversy has arisen around some of Bailey's statements on nationalism, American isolationism, Soviet totalitarianism, Fascism, Zionism, Nazism, race relations, Africans, Jews, and the religions of Judaism and Christianity. Yonassan Gershom and others have claimed that her writings contain racist material.\n\n\nThe American Chassidic author Yonassan Gershom wrote that Bailey's plan for a New World Order and her call for \"the gradual dissolution—again if in any way possible—of the Orthodox Jewish faith\" revealed that \"her goal is nothing less than the destruction of Judaism itself.\" Gershom also wrote that \"This stereotyped portrayal of Jews is followed by a hackneyed diatribe against the Biblical Hebrews, based upon the \"angry Jehovah\" theology of nineteenth-century Protestantism. Jews do not, and never have, worshipped an angry vengeful god, and we Jews never, ever call God 'Jehovah'.\"\n\nBailey taught a form of universal spirituality that transcended denominational identification, believing that, \"Every class of human beings is a group of brothers. Catholics, Jews, Gentiles, occidentals and orientals are all the sons of God.\" She stated that all religions originate from the same spiritual source, and that humanity will eventually come to realize this, and as they do so, the result will be the emergence of a universal world religion and a \"new world order\".\n\nAuthor Steven Sutcliffe wrote that Bailey's \"World Goodwill\" organization was promoting groups of \"world servers\" to, as he quotes Bailey, \"serve the Plan, Humanity, the Hierarchy and the Christ\".\n\nDespite her focus on unity of religion, Bromley and Hammond point out that Bailey and other \"occultists\" \"... hammered home the central idea, 'The East is the true home of spiritual knowledge and occult wisdom'.\"\n\nThe Arcane School, founded by Alice and Foster Bailey to disseminate spiritual teachings, organizes a worldwide \"Triangles\" program to bring people together in groups of three, for daily meditation and study. Their belief is that they receive divine energy through meditation and that this energy is transmitted to humanity, so raising spiritual awareness. John Michael Greer's \"New Encyclopedia of the Occult\" states that the school \"seeks to develop a New Group of World Servers to accomplish the work of the Hierarchy of Masters, under the guidance of its head, the Christ.\"\n\nBailey made extensive use of the term \"New Age\" in her books and some writers have described her as the founder of the New Age movement, although \"The New Age\" was used as the title of a Journal of Christian liberalism and Socialism, published as early as 1894, predating Bailey's use of the term.\n\nJames R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton, in \"Perspectives on the New Age\" wrote, \"The most important—though certainly not the only—source of this transformative metaphor, as well as the term \"New Age\", was Theosophy, particularly as the Theosophical perspective was mediated to the movement by the works of Alice Bailey.\"\n\nSir John Sinclair, in his book \"The Alice Bailey Inheritance\", commented on the seminal influence of Alice Bailey, which, he said, underlies the consciousness growth movement in the 20th century.\n\nSeveral writers have mentioned the affinity of some of Bailey's concepts with modern expressions of paganism.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the neopagan author and ceremonial magic ritualist Caroll Poke Runyon published a magazine called \"The Seventh Ray,\" its name taken from the writings of Alice Bailey. In the 1990s, two volumes of collected articles from the magazine were published as \"The Seventh Ray Book I, The Blue Ray\" and \"The Seventh Ray Book II, the Red Ray.\"\n\nIn contrast to this, Daren Kemp in \"Handbook to the New Age\" sees critical differences between neopaganism and New Age movements and indicates that it is a mistake to conflate them.\n\nAuthor Catherine Wessinger wrote that Bailey was a liberated woman \"... sixty years before it became popular\" and that Bailey's books expressed a similar \"millennial view\" to the works of Annie Besant. Wessinger stated that they were \"an important source of the contemporary New Age movement.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopedia of Women And Religion in North America\", several leaders of New Age philosophy have further developed Bailey's teachings, including the well-known personalities JZ Knight (who channels the entity known by the name Ramtha), Helen Schucman (author of A Course in Miracles through the process of telepathic dictation she called \"scribing\"), and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (who published what she referred to as \"dictations from Ascended Masters\"). These developments have been referred to by other sources as \"spin-offs\" and splinter groups.\" (p. 65) (p. 557) The differences between Theosophy, Bailey and Elizabeth Clare Prophet can be noted in connection with Elizabeth Clare Prophet's radical concepts of catastrophic change and survivalism, including the building of fall-out shelters. (p. 81) The validity of the Elizabeth Clare Prophet's writings was \"... disputed by Theosophical writers\".\n\nThe \"Tibetan\" teacher, Djwhal Khul, whom Bailey claimed was the co-author of many of her books, has also been claimed as co-author by two new female channelers, Violet Starre and Moriah Marston. Starre claims to have channeled Bailey's old teacher twice: the title of her first book, \"Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays & More\", owes an obvious debt to Bailey's writings, and is sometimes listed in book catalogues under the full title \"\"Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays & More (Teachings Similar to Those Given to Alice A. Bailey)\" by Djwhal (channeled Through Violet Starre) Khul.\". The same influence can also be seen in Starre's \"The Amethyst Light: Djwhal Khul Through Violet Starre\", published in 2004. Marston's \"Soul Searching with Djwahl Khul, the Tibetan\", was published in 2006, and according to her publisher, Airleaf Books, \"She has been a conscious channel for Ascended Master Djwhal Khul since 1986.\"\n\nThe many claims and teachings of the spin-off groups underscores their divergences, for example there appears to be a widespread confusion about the phrase and meaning of \"Ascendant Master\" in that it was adopted by Mark and Elizabeth Prophet but not by Theosophists or Alice Bailey. (p. 111) The concepts and language have been conflated in the popular mind.\n\nIn 1930, with the patronage of English-Dutch spiritualist, theosophist and scholar Olga Froebe-Kapteyn, Bailey established the short-lived \"School of Spiritual Research\" located on Froebe-Kapteyn's estate, Casa Gabriella, in Switzerland. (In 1932 the school was closed because of personal conflict between Bailey and Froebe-Kapteyn, at which time Froebe-Kapteyn replaced it with the Eranos group.)\n\nRoberto Assagioli, founder of Psychosynthesis, was a lecturer at School of Spiritual Research. He continued a close association with Bailey during the 1930s; some of his writings were published in Bailey's magazine \"The Beacon\"; and he was a trustee of Bailey's organization, the Lucis Trust. He had developed his approach to psychology, called Psychosynthesis, beginning in 1910; his methods were later influenced by some elements of Bailey's work. However, authors John Firman and Ann Gila write that Assagioli kept what he referred to as a \"wall of silence\" between the areas of psychosynthesis and religion or metaphysics, insisting that they not be confused with each other.\n\nRoger J. Woolger said, in a paper presented to the \"Beyond the Brain\" Conference held at Cambridge University in 1999, \"In Tansley as in Brennan you will find descriptions of a hierarchy of subtle bodies called the etheric, emotional, mental and spiritual that surround the physical body. (Tansley attributed the source of his model to Alice Bailey's theosophical commentary on The \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\", the \"locus classicus\" of Hindu teaching.)\"\n\nBailey's influence can be found in therapeutic communities with which she was never directly involved, such as the Human Potential Movement. She was also cited in \"THERAPEUTIC TOUCH: Healing Science or Psychic Midwife?\" by Sharon Fish.\n\nAlice Bailey makes no reference to unidentified flying objects This is not surprising since Alice Bailey's books were written between 1919 and 1949 and \"The emergence of religion specifically focused on UFOs is a post-1947 phenomena.\" But she did speak of Masters as having evolved beyond the human level, and expounded a cosmology of a living universe in which even planets and stars are regarded as living entities. These ideas may partially account for an association in minds of some between Bailey, and others of the Theosophical schools, and UFOs. For instance, Christopher Partridge wrote of this association as \"easily transferred\" The connection does exist in the sense that there is a subset of persons interested in both esoteric writings and UFOs and who link them as shown by the fact that some books that cite Alice Bailey or Theosophy also cite UFOs.\n\nChristopher Partridge wrote that the works of Bailey, Rudolf Steiner, and Theosophy in general all influenced what he called the \"UFO religions\". He explained that \"... Theosophy has several prominent branches, and, strictly speaking, the branch which has had the most important influence on the UFO religion is that developed by Alice Bailey.\". Partridge also quoted Gordon Melton, who suggested that the first UFO religion was Guy Ballard's \"I Am\" Activity, (which Bailey described as a \"cheap comedy\".)\n\nProfessor Robert S. Ellwood of the University of Southern California investigated a wide range of religious and spiritual groups in the United States during the 1970s, including a nationwide group of UFO believers called Understanding, Inc., which had been founded by a contactee named Daniel Fry. He reported that, \"There is no particular religious practice connected with the meeting, although the New Age Prayer derived from the Alice Bailey writings is used as an invocation.\"\n\nGeorge D. Chryssides of the University of Wolverhampton, cited Bailey's influence on the ideas of the Order of the Solar Temple and related UFO organisations.\n\nLou Reed of the Velvet Underground was a devoted reader of Bailey's work, especially her book \"A Treatise on White Magic\", which he urged on others. Author Ryan H. Walsh suggests that book had an influence on the Velvet's second album, \"White Light/White Heat.\"\n\nIn 1975, Todd Rundgren released an album titled \"Initiation\" which has a song called \"Initiation\" on side one. The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of Initiation, taught by Alice A. Bailey and C.W. Leadbeater. The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called \"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire\"; the three parts of the song are listed as: \"I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire.\" The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey's book \"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire\". Also in 1975, Rundgren released an album by his side-project Utopia titled \"Another Live\". This album contained a song titled \"The Seven Rays\" (see reference above). Finally, in 1977, Rundgren followed up with another Bailey reference with a song entitled \"Love in Action\" from the Utopia album Oops! Wrong Planet. Love in Action was the concept promoted by Bailey's and Foster Bailey's \"World Goodwill\" organization.\n\nIn 1982, Bailey's influence appeared in pop culture, with the release of Van Morrison's album \"Beautiful Vision\", in which he directly referred to the teachings and the Tibetan in the lyrics of the songs \"Dweller on the Threshold\" and \"Aryan Mist\". Morrison also used the phrase \"world of glamour\", reminiscent of Bailey's \"Glamour: A World Problem\", in the songs \"Ivory Tower\" and \"Green Mansions\". The song Ancient of Days from the 1984 Sense of Wonder album appears to be a reference to a Bailey concept found in such books as \"The Externalization of the Hierarchy\". Alice A. Bailey and the Tibetan's \"Glamour: A World Problem\" is also directly cited in the liner notes to Morrison's album \"Inarticulate Speech of the Heart\".\n\nThe Wikipedia article on José López Rega, Argentina's Minister of Social Welfare during the Peronist government, cites his interest in esoteric studies. Apparently, these included the writings of Alice Bailey: \"Also found in his home were 12 volumes by Alice Bailey on telepathy and Cosmic Fire ...\"\n\nThe Lucis Publishing Company and the Lucis Press Limited are the official publishers of Alice Bailey's books.\n\nWorks containing the prefatory \"Extract from a Statement by the Tibetan\", generally taken to indicate the book was a \"received\" work.\n\nWorks in which Bailey claimed sole authorship of the material.\n\n\n"}

From 1818 he was studying law, history and social studies in Vienna, Göttingen and Berlin. At the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, he interrupted his studies and returned to Greece. After a series of adventures he reached Trieste, and from there he passed to Missolonghi along with some philhellenes.\n\nIn Missolonghi he cooperated with Alexandros Mavrokordatos and was set in several gubernatorial positions (secretary of executive) in the Provisional Administration of Greece. He took part in the First Greek National Assembly at Epidaurus. There, almost on his own, he wrote the new state's constitution and the declaration of 15 January 1822, which informed the European powers, allied in the Holy Alliance, that the revolution was national and not social. In 1823 he was in charge of the committee, which was sent to London for the negotiation of a public loan. In 1827, he was elected representative to the National Convention at Troezen. In October of the same year, he went to Paris, in order to continue his studies.\n\nReturning from Paris, Polyzoidis found himself pitted against the autocratic government of Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias, and soon passed into the opposition, editing the newspaper \"Apollon\", printed at Hydra. In 1832 he was nominated by the Bavarian regency to be president of a five-member court of Nafplio, which had to judge Theodoros Kolokotronis, Dimitrios Plapoutas and other former leaders of the War of Independence on trumped-up charges of treason. Polyzoidis, together with fellow judge Georgios Tertsetis, knowing very well the innocence of the defendants, refused to countersign the decision of condemnation. The Minister of Justice, K. Schinas, personally intervened to force Polyzoidis to append his signature to the document \"in the name of the King\", to which Polysoidis replied: \"I prefer my hand to be cut off rather than sign.\" His stance caused his imprisonment and violent maltreatment. This refusal to accept royal intervention in the administration of justice was indicative of the Polyzoidis' integrity, and his portrait, together with that of Tertsetis, now hangs in the \"Areios Pagos\", the Supreme Court of Greece.\n\nAfter the coming of age of king Otto, he was rehabilitated and nominated as vice-president of the \"Areios Pagos\" and counselor of state. In 1837, he was named minister of education and of internal affairs. In the former capacity, he was instrumental in the establishment of Greece's first university in Athens, while from his latter post he fought against censorship. Following the overthrow of Otto in 1862, he was appointed prefect of the joint Attica and Boeotia Prefecture. He died in Athens in 1873.\n\nThe events of the trial of Kolokotronis and the consecutive trial of Polyzoidis and Terchetis have been portrayed in the 1974 Greek Film \"Η δίκη των Δικαστών\" (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255936/).\n\n"}

His birth name was Narendrachandra Dhar. He was the son of Rajchandra Dhar, a doctor, and Sushila Devi. He was a spiritually and intellectually inclined child, who by age 11 had memorised the \"Astadhyayi\" of Pāṇini and the Bhagavad Gita. He was named Baroda Brahmachari after going through the sacred thread ceremony. He also won a state scholarship as a teen and completed university IA and BA degrees at the University of Dhaka and an MA from the Sanskrit College of the University of Calcutta.\n\nAt 16, he joined the Assam Bangiya Saraswata Math (the \"ashram\"), located in the village of Kokilamukh near Jorhat in Assam. He was a disciple of the ashram's founder, Paramahansa Srimat Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Dev, who initiated him into sannyas. Anirvan's new monastic name was Nirvanananda Saraswati. He taught at the ashram school and edited its monthly magazine \"Aryyadarpan\". In fact, the Aryadarpan still retains the following Sanskrit epigram, in the Rathoddhata metre, that Sri Anirvan (then Srimat Varada Brahmacari) wrote: arya-sastra-gahanartha-dipakascetas-timiravaravarakah/ dyotayan vijayatam vipascitam arcisa hrdayam aryadarpanah//\n\nSome time after 1930, Nirvanananda changed his name to Anirvan and ceased to wear the ochre swami's robes. He travelled widely in North India, eventually returning to Assam and establishing an ashram in Kamakhya near Guwahati. However, he continued to travel. In the 1940s, he lived in Lohaghat and Almora. Madame Lizelle Reymond documented some of this period in \"My Life with a Brahmin Family\" (1958) and \"To Live Within\" (1971). During this time, Sri Anirvan translated Sri Aurobindo's \"The Life Divine\" into Bengali (as \"Divya Jeevan Prasanga\"); this book, his first, was published in two volumes between 1948 and 1951.\n\nIn 1953, Sri Anirvan moved to Shillong in Assam. His reputation as a Vedic scholar grew; and he wrote both in Bengali (chiefly) and in English (he was also fluent in French) on various aspects of Hindu philosophy (particularly Samkhya, the Upanishads, the Gita and Vedanta) and the parallels between Rigvedic, Puranic, Tantric and Buddhist thought. His magnum opus, \"Veda Mimamsa\", was published in three volumes in 1961, 1965 and 1970. This work won him the Rabindra award.\n\nThough Sri Anirvan was a saint, he studied subjects such as Marxism and gardening; yet he called himself a simple baul .\n\nSri Anirvan made his final move, to Kolkata, in 1965.

{"id": "1083290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1083290", "title": "Buffalo Bill (character)", "text": "Buffalo Bill (character)\n\nJame Gumb (known by the nickname Buffalo Bill) is a character and the primary antagonist of Thomas Harris's 1988 novel \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and its 1991 film adaptation, in which he is played by Ted Levine. In the film and the novel, he is a serial killer who murders overweight women and skins them so he can make a \"woman suit\" for himself.\n\nAccording to the novel, Gumb was born in California on October 25, 1949, and abandoned by his mother – an alcoholic aspiring actress who misspelled \"James\" on his birth certificate – and taken into foster care at age two. The screenplay omits Gumb's backstory, but does imply that he had a traumatic childhood. Lecter summarizes Gumb's life thus: \"Billy was not born a criminal, but made one by years of systematic abuse.\"\n\nThe novel goes on to tell of Gumb living in foster homes until the age of 10 before being adopted by his grandparents, who became his first victims. The story then puts him in Tulare Vocational Rehabilitation, a psychiatric hospital where he learns to be a tailor. Later, Gumb has a relationship with Benjamin Raspail. After Raspail leaves him, he kills Raspail's new lover, Klaus, and flays him.\n\nBoth the novel and film depict Gumb as a tortured and self-hating individual. Believing himself to be transgender, he wants to become a woman but is too psychologically disturbed to qualify for gender reassignment surgery. He kills women so he can skin them and create a \"woman suit\" for himself.\n\nGumb's modus operandi is to approach a woman, pretending to be injured and asking for help, then knock her out in a surprise attack and kidnap her. He takes her to his house and leaves her in a well in his basement, where he starves her until her skin is loose enough to easily remove. In the first two cases, he leads the victims upstairs, slips nooses around their necks and pushes them from the stairs, strangling them. He then skins parts of their body (a different section on each victim), and then dumps each body into a different river, destroying any trace of evidence. This MO caused the homicide squad to nickname him Buffalo Bill (Buffalo Bill's Wild West show typically claimed that Buffalo Bill Cody had scalped a Cheyenne warrior). One officer quipped it was because he \"skins his humps.\" In the case of Gumb's first victim, Fredrica Bimmel, he weighed down her body, so she ends up being the third victim found. In the case of the fourth victim, he shoots her instead of strangling her, then inserts a moth into her throat and dumps the body.\n\nAt the start of the novel, Gumb has already murdered five women. Behavioral Science Unit Chief Jack Crawford assigns gifted trainee Clarice Starling to question incarcerated serial killer Hannibal Lecter about the case. (Lecter had met Gumb while treating Raspail.) When Gumb kidnaps Catherine Martin, the daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin, Lecter offers to give Starling a psychological profile of the killer in return for a transfer to a federal institution; this profile is mostly made up of cryptic clues designed to help Starling figure it out for herself, although Lecter does directly inform Clarice about Gumb wanting to have a sex change operation. This is highlighted in one of the most famous scenes from the movie where Gumb dances to the song \"Goodbye Horses\" by Q Lazzarus, putting on makeup and other women's accessories to complete his \"transformation\" into a woman. Starling eventually deduces from Lecter's riddles that Gumb knew his first victim, Frederica Bimmel, and goes to Bimmel's hometown of Belvedere, Ohio to gather information. By this time, Crawford has already found out the killer's true identity and gone with a SWAT team to his house to arrest him, but they find that it is only a business address. Meanwhile, Starling goes to the home of Bimmel's employer, Mrs. Lippman, only to find Gumb — calling himself \"Jack Gordon\" — living there. (Gumb had murdered Mrs. Lippman earlier.) When Starling sees a moth flutter by, she realizes she has found her man and orders him to surrender. Gumb flees into the basement and stalks her with a revolver and night vision goggles. Just as he is about to shoot Starling, she hears him behind her, turns around and opens fire, killing him.\n\nHarris based various elements of Gumb's MO on six real-life serial killers:\n\n\nMarjorie Garber, author of \"Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety\", asserts that despite the book and the film indicating that Buffalo Bill merely \"believes\" himself to be transsexual, they still imply negative connotations about transsexualism. Garber says, \"Harris's book manifests its cultural anxiety through a kind of baroque bravado of plot,\" and calls the book \"a fable of gender dysphoria gone spectacularly awry\".\n\nBarbara Creed, writing in \"Screening the Male: Exploring Masculinities in the Hollywood Cinema\", says that Buffalo Bill wants to become a woman \"presumably because he sees femininity as a more desirable state, possibly a superior one\". For Buffalo Bill, the woman is \"[a] totem animal\". Not only does he want to wear women's skin, he wants to become a woman; he dresses in women's clothes and tucks his penis behind his legs to appear female. Creed writes, \"To experience a rebirth as woman, Buffalo Bill must wear the skin of woman not just to experience a physical transformation but also to acquire the \"power of transformation\" associated with woman's ability to give birth.\" Buffalo Bill wears the skin of his totem animal to assume its power.\n\nJudith Halberstam, author of \"Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters\", writes, \"The cause for Buffalo Bill's extreme violence against women lies not in his gender confusion or his sexual orientation but in his humanist presumption that his sex and his gender and his orientation must all match-up to a mythic norm of white heterosexual masculinity.\" Halberstam says Buffalo Bill symbolizes a lack of ease with one's skin. She writes that the character is also a combination of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in how he is the creator gathering body parts and experimenting with his own body. Halberstam writes, \"He does not understand gender as inherent, innate; he reads it only as a surface effect, a representation, an external attribute engineered into identity.\" Buffalo Bill challenges \"the interiority of gender\" by taking skin and remaking it into a costume.\n\nThe film adaptation of \"Silence of the Lambs\" was criticized by some gay rights groups for its portrayal of Gumb as bisexual and transgender. A Johns Hopkins sex-reassignment surgeon, present in the book but not the film (his scene was deleted and is found in bonus materials on the DVD), protests exactly the same thing. FBI Director Jack Crawford pacifies him by repeating that Gumb is not in fact transsexual, but merely believes himself to be. In the film, a similar scene is shown with Starling and Lecter in the same roles as the surgeon and Crawford, respectively. In the director's commentary for the 1991 film, director Jonathan Demme draws attention to various Polaroids taken of Buffalo Bill in the company of strippers; these are visible in Gumb's basement in the film.\n"}

He fostered the development of alternating current that made possible the expansion of the electric power industry in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of hysteresis that enabled engineers to design better electromagnetic apparatus equipment including especially electric motors for use in industry.\n\nAt the time of his death, Steinmetz held over 200 patents. A genius in both mathematics and electronics, his work earned him the nicknames \"Forger of Thunderbolts\" and \"The Wizard of Schenectady\". Steinmetz's equation, Steinmetz solids, Steinmetz curves, and Steinmetz equivalent circuit theory are all named after him, as are numerous honors and scholarships, including the \"IEEE Charles Proteus Steinmetz Award\", one of the highest technical recognitions given by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers professional society.\n\nSteinmetz was born Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz on April 9, 1865 in Breslau, Province of Silesia, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland) the son of Caroline (Neubert) and Karl Heinrich Steinmetz. He was baptized a Lutheran into the Evangelical Church of Prussia. Steinmetz, who only stood four feet tall as an adult, suffered from dwarfism, hunchback, and hip dysplasia, as did his father and grandfather. Steinmetz attended Johannes Gymnasium and astonished his teachers with his proficiency in mathematics and physics.\n\nFollowing the Gymnasium, Steinmetz went on to the University of Breslau to begin work on his undergraduate degree in 1883. He was on the verge of finishing his doctorate in 1888 when he came under investigation by the German police for activities on behalf of a socialist university group and articles he had written for a local socialist newspaper.\n\nAs socialist meetings and press had been banned in Germany, Steinmetz fled to Zürich in 1888 to escape possible arrest. Faced with an expiring visa, he emigrated to the United States in 1889. He changed his first name to \"Charles\" in order to sound more American, and chose the middle name \"Proteus\", a wise hunchbacked character from the \"Odyssey\" who knew many secrets, after a childhood epithet given by classmates Steinmetz felt suited him.\n\nCornell University Professor Ronald R. Kline, the author of \"Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist\", contended that other factors were more directly involved in Steinmetz's decision to leave his homeland, such as being in arrears with his tuition at the University and life at home with his father, stepmother, and their daughters being tension filled.\n\nDespite his earlier efforts and interest in socialism, by 1922 Steinmetz concluded that socialism would never work in the United States, because the country lacked a \"powerful, centralized government of competent men, remaining continuously in office\", and because \"only a small percentage of Americans accept this viewpoint today\".\n\nA member of the original Technical Alliance, which also included Thorstein Veblen and Leland Olds, Steinmetz had great faith in the ability of machines to eliminate human toil and create abundance for all. He put it this way: \"Some day we make the good things of life for everybody\".\n\nSteinmetz is known for his contribution in three major fields of alternating current (AC) systems theory: hysteresis, steady-state analysis, and transients.\n\nShortly after arriving in the United States, Steinmetz went to work for Rudolf Eickemeyer in Yonkers, New York, and published in the field of magnetic hysteresis, which gave him worldwide professional recognition. Eickemeyer's firm developed transformers for use in the transmission of electrical power among many other mechanical and electrical devices. In 1893 Eickemeyer's company, along with all of its patents and designs, was bought by the newly formed General Electric Company, where he quickly became known as the engineering wizard in GE's engineering community.\n\nSteinmetz's work revolutionized AC circuit theory and analysis, which had been carried out using complicated, time-consuming calculus-based methods. In the groundbreaking paper, \"Complex Quantities and Their Use in Electrical Engineering\", presented at a July 1893 meeting published in the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), Steinmetz simplified these complicated methods to \"a simple problem of algebra\". He systematized the use of complex number phasor representation in electrical engineering education texts, whereby the lower-case letter \"j\" is used to designate the 90-degree rotation operator in AC system analysis. His seminal books and many other AIEE papers \"taught a whole generation of engineers how to deal with AC phenomena\".\n\nSteinmetz also greatly advanced the understanding of lightning. His systematic experiments resulted in the first laboratory created \"man-made lightning\", earning him the nickname the \"Forger of Thunderbolts\". These were conducted in a football field-sized laboratory at General Electric, using 120,000 volt generators. He also erected a lightning tower to attract natural lightning in order to study its patterns and effects, which resulted in several theories.\n\nSteinmetz acted in the following professional capacities:\n\nHe was granted an honorary degree from Harvard University in 1901 and a doctorate from Union College in 1903.\n\nSteinmetz wrote 13 books and 60 articles, not exclusively about engineering. He was a member and adviser to the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta at Union College, whose chapter house there was one of the first ever electrified residences.\n\nWhile serving as president of the Schenectady Board of Education Steinmetz introduced numerous progressive reforms, including extended school hours, school meals, school nurses, special classes for the children of immigrants, and the distribution of free textbooks.\n\nIn spite of his love for children and family life, Steinmetz remained unmarried to prevent the spinal deformity afflicting himself, his father, and grandfather from being passed on to any offspring.\n\nWhen Joseph LeRoy Hayden, a loyal and hardworking lab assistant, announced that he would marry and look for his own living quarters, Steinmetz made the unusual proposal of opening his large home, complete with research lab, greenhouse, and office to the Haydens and their prospective family. Hayden favored the idea, but his future wife was very wary of the unorthodox setup. She finally agreed after Steinmetz's assurance she could run the house as she saw fit.\n\nAfter an uneasy start, the arrangement worked well for all parties, especially after three Hayden children were born. Steinmetz legally adopted Joseph Hayden as his son, becoming grandfather to the youngsters, entertaining them with fantastic stories and spectacular scientific demonstrations. The unusual but harmonious living arrangements lasted for the rest of Steinmetz's life.\n\nSteinmetz founded America's first glider club, but none of its prototypes \"could be dignified with the term 'flight'\".\n\nSteinmetz was a lifelong agnostic. He died of a heart attack\non October 26, 1923, and was buried in Vale Cemetery in Schenectady.\n\nThe \"Forger of Thunderbolts\" and \"Wizard of Schenectady\" earned wide recognition among the scientific community and numerous awards and honors both during his life and posthumously.\n\n\"Steinmetz's equation\", derived from his experiments, defines the approximate heat energy due to magnetic hysteresis released, per cycle per unit area of magnetic material. A Steinmetz solid is the solid body generated by the intersection of two or three cylinders of equal radius at right angles. Steinmetz equivalent circuit theory is still widely used for the design and testing of induction motors.\n\nOne of the highest technical recognitions given by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the \"IEEE Charles Proteus Steinmetz Award\", is given for major contributions to standardization within the field of electrical and electronics engineering. Other awards include the Certificate of Merit of Franklin Institute, 1908; the Elliott Cresson Medal, 1913; and the Cedergren Medal, 1914.\n\nThe \"Charles Proteus Steinmetz Memorial Lecture\" series was begun in his honor in 1925, sponsored by the Schenectady branch of the IEEE. Through 2017 seventy-three gatherings have taken place, held almost exclusively at Union College, featuring such renown figures as Nobel laureate experimental physicist Robert A. Millikan, helicopter inventor Igor Sikorsky, nuclear submarine pioneer Admiral Hyman G. Rickover (1963), Nobel-winning semiconductor inventor William Shockley, and Internet 'founding father' Leonard Kleinrock. The \"Charles P. Steinmetz Scholarship\" is awarded annually by the college, underwritten since its inception in 1923 by the General Electric Company.\n\nThe \"Charles P. Steinmetz Memorial Scholarship\" was established at Union by Marjorie Hayden, daughter of Joseph and Corrine Hayden, and is awarded to students majoring in engineering or physics.\n\nSteinmetz's connection to Union is further celebrated with the annual Steinmetz Symposium, a day-long event in which Union undergraduates give presentations on research they have done. Steinmetz Hall, which houses the Union College computer center, is named after him.\n\nSteinmetz was portrayed in 1959 by the actor Rod Steiger in the CBS television anthology series, \"The Joseph Cotten Show\". The episode focused on his socialist activities in Germany.\n\nA Chicago public high school, Steinmetz College Prep, is named for him.\n\nA public park in north Schenectady, New York was named for him in 1931.\n\nSteinmetz is featured in John Dos Passos's \"U.S.A.\" trilogy in one of the biographies. He also serves as a major character in Starling Lawrence's \"The Lightning Keeper\".\n\nNovelist John Ball grew up in Steinmetz's house. His parents were graduate students paid by General Electric to live with and take care of the man Ball called \"Uncle Steinie\". Ball used to tell his Steinmetz stories at the Southern California Mystery Writers Association meetings.\n\nSteinmetz is a major character in the novel \"Electric City\" by Elizabeth Rosner.\n\nAt the time of his death, Steinmetz held over 200 patents:\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Chiswick, West London – at that time within Middlesex – on 13 July 1949. His father was a postman and his mother a cook. Expelled from school at 13 and placed on two years probation at 14, he then worked in a series of \"menial jobs\" before \"turning on, tuning in, and dropping out\" in 1967. After living in a commune in Cumberland, he started a commune on Eel Pie Island in the River Thames near Richmond, Surrey, in 1969. In 1971 he took part in the All London Squatters organization, squatting in Camden, North London, then Stepney Green, East London, and Peckham in South East London, while being very active in anarchist circles. In 1978 he settled in Camberwell where he has lived ever since. He has suffered from poor health for most of his adult life. After contracting TB in France in 1969 Harper was hospitalised for three months in 1971, leaving his lungs and heart badly damaged and leading to heart failure in 2002. In early 2006 he survived heart attacks, in 2008 was diagnosed as diabetic, further heart attacks followed. In 2017 he was diagnosed with cancer and underwent major surgery at Guy's Hospital in London, which was successful. \nBeginning in the early 1970s he became a prolific illustrator for many anarchist, radical, alternative and mainstream publications, organisations, groups and individuals, including Freedom Press, Undercurrents, Respect for Animals, BIT Newsletter, Arts Lab Newsletter, Idiot International, !977 Firemans Strike, Libertarian Education, The Idler, Radical Community Medicine, Anarchy Magazine, Black Flag, Anarchy Comix, Common Ground, Industrial Worker, Abelour Distillery, Country Life, Graphical Paper and Media Union, The Times Saturday Review, Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival, New Scientist, Oxford University Press, Penguin Books, Times Educational Supplemnt, London Anarchist Bookfair, Public and Commercial Services Union, The Sunday Times Magazine, Catholic Worker, Soil Association, The Bodleian Library, New Statesman, Cienfeugos Anarchist Review, Headline Books, The Financial Times, Resurgence, Scotland on Sunday, Town and Country Planning Association, Movement Against a Monarchy, Nursing Times, John Hegarty, The Listener, Zero, McCallan Whisky, Solidarity, New Society, News From Neasden, House & Garden, The Tablet, Radical Science Journal, Royal Mail, The Co-ops Fairs, Picador Books, Pluto Press, Working Press, Anarchismo, Insurrection, Our Generation, Ogilvy & Mather, Vogue, Radio Times, National Union of Teachers, Faber & Faber, Pimlico, Trades Union Congress, Transport and General Workers Union, Serpents Tale, Compendium Books, Poison Girls, Yale University Press, Verso, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, Elephant Editions, Intelligent Life, Landworker, Zounds, Honey, New Musical Express, Knockabout Comics, Trickett & Webb, The Times, See Sharp Press, Countryside Commission, Industrial Common Ownership Movement, BBC Worldwide, Stop The War Coalition, Aganovich, The Folio Society, Unison, Unite The Union, Anarchist Studies, Country Standard, Strike, Fitzrovia News, Anarchist Black Cross and many others. In 1992 he won a W H Smith Illustration Award and in 2002 he was the winner of the Trade Union Press and PR Award for Best Illustration.\n\nHis early drawing style was typically exemplified by the utopian 'Visions' series of posters, for the \"Undercurrents\" 1974 anthology \"Radical Technology\". These were highly detailed and precise illustrations showing scenes of post-revolutionary self-sufficiency, autonomy and alternative technology in urban and rural settings, becoming almost \"de rigueur\" on the kitchen wall of any self-respecting radical's commune, squat or bedsit during the 1970s. Of these posters Harper writes:\n\nHeavily influenced by George Grosz, Félix Vallotton, Fernand Léger, Eric Gill and, most of all, the narrative woodcuts of Frans Masereel, Harper's style evolved in the 1980s in a bolder, expressionist direction, with much of his later work resembling woodcut, although he mainly works in pen and ink, and watercolour.\n\nIn 1987 \"Anarchy, A Graphic Guide\", which Harper wrote and illustrated, was published by Camden Press: This has become a definitive and popular introduction to the subject, combining a thorough and inclusive overview of anarchism with his distinctive illustration. England's principal radical illustrator, he had a strong association with Freedom Press from 1969 up to 2005 as well as many other anarchist groups, publications and individuals. Harper remains a \"100% committed\" and engaged anarchist activist, having been deeply involved with organising the UK's annual Anarchist Bookfair, re-designing Freedom newspaper in 2005, producing books, pamphlets, posters, book covers, postcards and drawings for, and supporting, anarchists everywhere. His drawings have been used and reproduced by anarchists and others in nearly every country of the world. He has produced a book of anarchist postage stamps 'For after the Revolution' and created his own small publishing project Agraphia Press. He does a great deal of work for the Union movement in Britain and he began working for \"The Guardian\" in the early 1990s, his work appearing every week until he was sacked in 2014. His illustrations for \"The Guardian\"'s \"Country Diary\" column were published as a book in 2003 by Agraphia Press. \"Graphic Anarchy\", an exhibition of his work, was held in 2003 at the Newsroom Gallery, London. He is currently writing and illustrating an entirely new version of his book Anarchy: A Graphic Guide. You can see some of the new drawings at www.facebook.com/AnarchyAGraphicGuide. Although in poor health, Harper continues to work as an illustrator. One of his drawings, 'Solidarity', was displayed on a giant screen in Cairo's Tahrir Square in 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17181248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17181248", "title": "Daniel (biblical figure)", "text": "Daniel (biblical figure)\n\nDaniel () is the hero of the biblical Book of Daniel. A noble Jewish youth of Jerusalem, he is taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and serves the king and his successors with loyalty and ability until the time of the Persian conqueror Cyrus, all the while remaining true to the God of Israel. The consensus of modern scholars is that Daniel never existed, and the book is a cryptic allusion to the reign of the 2nd century BCE Greek king Antiochus IV Epiphanes.\n\nSix cities claim the Tomb of Daniel, the most famous being that in Susa, in southern Iran, at a site known as Shush-e Daniyal. He is not a prophet in Judaism, but the rabbis reckoned him to be the most distinguished member of the Babylonian diaspora, unsurpassed in piety and good deeds, firm in his adherence to the Law despite being surrounded by enemies who sought his ruin, and in the first few centuries CE they wrote down the many legends that had grown up around his name. The various branches of the Christian church do recognise him as a prophet, and although he is not mentioned in the Quran, Muslim sources describe him as a prophet (\"nabi\").\n\nDaniel's name means \"God (El) is my judge\". While the best known Daniel is the hero of the Book of Daniel who interprets dreams and receives apocalyptic visions, the Bible also briefly mentions three other individuals of this name:\n\nDaniel (Dn'il, or Danel) is also the name of a figure in the Aqhat legend from Ugarit. (Ugarit was a Canaanite city destroyed around 1200 BCE – the tablet containing the story is dated c. 1360 BCE). This legendary Daniel is known for his righteousness and wisdom and a follower of the god El (hence his name), who made his will known through dreams and visions. It is unlikely that Ezekiel knew the far older Canaanite legend, but it seems reasonable to suppose that some connection exists between the two. The authors of the tales in the first half of the Book of Daniel were likely also unaware of the Ugaritic Daniel and probably took the name of their hero from Ezekiel; the author of the visions in the second half in turn took his hero's name from the tales.\n\nThe Book of Daniel begins with an introduction telling how Daniel and his companions came to be in Babylon, followed by a set of tales set in the Babylonian and Persian courts, followed in turn by a set of visions in which Daniel sees the remote future of the world and of Israel. The tales in chapters 1–6 can be dated to the 3rd or early 2nd centuries BCE; it is generally accepted that these were expanded by the addition of the visions in chapters 8–12 between 167 and 164 BCE.\n\nIn the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, Daniel and his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were among the young Jewish nobility carried off to Babylon following the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. The four are chosen for their intellect and beauty to be trained in the Babylonian court, and are given new names. Daniel is given the Babylonian name Belteshazzar (, written as ), while his companions are given the Babylonian names Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Daniel and his friends refuse the food and wine provided by the king of Babylon to avoid becoming defiled. They receive wisdom from God and surpass \"all the magicians and enchanters of the kingdom.\" Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a giant statue made of four metals with feet of mingled iron and clay, smashed by a stone from heaven. Only Daniel is able to interpret it: the dream signifies four kingdoms, of which Babylon is the first, but God will destroy them and replace them with his own kingdom. Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a great tree that shelters all the world and of a heavenly figure who decrees that the tree will be destroyed; again, only Daniel can interpret the dream, which concerns the sovereignty of God over the kings of the earth. When Nebuchadnezzar's son King Belshazzar uses the vessels from the Jewish temple for his feast, a hand appears and writes a mysterious message on the wall, which only Daniel can interpret; it tells the king that his kingdom will be given to the Medes and Persians, because Belshazzar, unlike Nebuchadnezzar, has not acknowledged the sovereignty of the God of Daniel. The Medes and Persians overthrow Nebuchadnezzar and the new king, Darius the Mede, appoints Daniel to high authority. Jealous rivals attempt to destroy Daniel with an accusation that he worships God instead of the king, and Daniel is thrown into a den of lions, but an angel saves him, his accusers are destroyed, and Daniel is restored to his position.\n\nIn the third year of Darius, Daniel has a series of visions. In the first, four beasts come out of the sea, the last with ten horns, and an eleventh horn grows and achieves dominion over the Earth and the \"Ancient of Days\" (God) gives dominion to \"one like a son of man\". An angel interprets the vision. In the second, a ram with two horns is attacked by a goat with one horn; the one horn breaks and is replaced by four. A little horn arises and attacks the people of God and the temple, and Daniel is informed how long the little horn's dominion will endure. In the third, Daniel is troubled to read in holy scripture (the book is not named but appears to be Jeremiah) that Jerusalem would be desolate for 70 years. Daniel repents on behalf of the Jews and requests that Jerusalem and its people be restored. An angel refers to a period of 70 \"sevens\" (or weeks) of years. In the final vision, Daniel sees a period of history culminating in a struggle between the \"king of the north\" and the \"king of the south\" in which God's people suffer terribly; an angel explains that in the end the righteous will be vindicated and God's kingdom will be established on Earth.\n\nThe Greek text of Daniel contains three additional tales, two of which feature Daniel (the third is an expansion of the tale of the fiery furnace). \n\nThe last mention of Daniel in the Book of Daniel is in the third year of Cyrus (). Rabbinic sources suppose that he was still alive during the reign of the Persian king Ahasuerus (better known as Artaxerxes – Babylonian Talmud, Megillah 15a, based on the Book of Esther 4, 5), when he was killed by Haman, the wicked prime minister of Ahasuerus (Targum Sheini on Esther, 4, 11).\n\nThe 1st century Jewish writer Josephus reported that Daniel's body lay in a tower in Ecbatana in Parthia, alongside the bodies of the kings of the Medes and Persians; later Jewish authorities said he was buried in Susa, and that near his house were hidden the vessels from the Temple of Solomon. Muslim sources reported that the Muslims had discovered his body, or possibly only a box containing his nerves and veins, together with a book, a jar of fat, and a signet ring engraved with the image of a man being licked by two lions. The corpse was reburied, and those who buried it decapitated to prevent them revealing the spot.\n\nToday six cities claim Daniel's Tomb: Babylon, Kirkuk and Muqdadiyah in Iraq, Susa and Malamir in Iran, and Samarkand in Uzbekistan. The most famous is that in Susa, (Shush, in southern Iran), at a site known as Shush-e Daniyal. According to Jewish tradition the rich and poor of the city quarreled over possession of the body, and the bier was therefore suspended from a chain over the centre of the river. A house of prayer open to all who believed in God was built nearby, and fishing was prohibited for a certain distance up and down the river; fish that swam in that section of the river had heads that glinted like gold, and ungodly persons who entered the sacred precinct would miraculously drown in the river. To this day the tomb is a popular site of pilgrimage.\n\nDaniel is not a prophet in Judaism: prophecy is reckoned to have ended with Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. In the Hebrew Bible his book is not included under the Prophets (the Hebrew Bible has three sections, Torah, Prophets and Writings), perhaps because its content does not match the prophetic books; but nevertheless the eight copies found among the Dead Sea Scrolls and the additional tales of the Greek text are a testament to Daniel's popularity in ancient times.\n\nThe Jewish rabbis of the first millennium CE reckoned Daniel to be the most distinguished member of the Babylonian diaspora, unsurpassed in piety and good deeds, firm in his adherence to the Law despite being surrounded by enemies who sought his ruin, and in the first few centuries CE they wrote down the legends that had grown up around his name. His captivity was foretold by the prophet Isaiah to King Hezekiah in these words, \"they (Hezekiah's descendants) shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.\" This misfortune was turned to a blessing when Daniel and his three companions were able to show their mutilated bodies to Nebuchadnezzar and so prove their innocence of charges of leading an unchaste life.\n\nDaniel kept the welfare of Nebuchadnezzar in mind continually, and when the king was condemned by God to live as a beast for a certain period Daniel prayed that the period of punishment should be shortened, and his prayer was granted. When Nebuchadnezzar was dying he wished to include Daniel among his heirs, but Daniel refused the honour, saying that he could not leave the inheritance of his forefathers for that of the uncircumcised. Daniel also restored the sight of king Darius, who had wrongly thrown the pious Daniel into prison on false charges, upon which many converted to Judaism.\n\nThe New Testament makes one reference to Daniel at Matthew 24:15, which asserts that Jesus recognised Daniel as a prophet of God. He is commemorated in the Coptic Church on the 23rd day of the Coptic month of Baramhat. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, the feast days celebrating St. Daniel the Prophet together with the Three Young Men, falls on December 17 (during the Nativity Fast), on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (the Sunday which falls between 11 and 17 December), and on the Sunday before Nativity. Daniel's prophecy regarding the stone which smashed the idol () is often used in Orthodox hymns as a metaphor for the Incarnation: the \"stone cut out\" being symbolic of the Logos (Christ), and the fact that it was cut \"without hands\" being symbolic of the virgin birth. Thus the hymns will refer to the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) as the \"uncut mountain\"\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church commemorates St. Daniel in the Roman Martyrology on July 21. Some local liturgical calendars of dioceses also list his feast, sometimes on July 21 and sometimes on another day. For example, the archdiocese of Gorizia celebrates the feast of St. Daniel, prophet and confessor, on September 11. The reading of the Mass is taken from the Book of Daniel, chapter 14; the Gradual from Psalm 91; the Alleluia verse from the Epistle of James 1; and the Gospel from Matthew 24. The Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod commemorates Daniel, together with the Three Young Men (Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego), on December 17.\n\nDaniel (Arabic: دانيال, \"Danyal\"), is not mentioned in the Qur'an, but there are accounts of his prophet-hood in later Muslim literature. He was carried off to Babylon after the destruction of Jerusalem, where he was rescued from lions with the aid of the prophet Jeremiah. (In Bel and the Dragon it is the prophet Habakkuk who plays this role). Another source (Tabiri) retells how Daniel interpreted the king's dream of a statue made of four metals destroyed by a rock from heaven. All sources, both classical and modern, describe Daniel as a saintly and righteous man. Abdullah Yusuf Ali in his Qur'anic commentary says:\nIn Kitab al-Kafi, Imam Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin asserts that Allah revealed to Daniel that, \"The most hated among my creatures are the ignorant ones who disrespect the scholars and do not follow them.

{"id": "20451367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20451367", "title": "Daniel Leavitt", "text": "Daniel Leavitt\n\nDaniel Leavitt (November 16, 1813 – July 27, 1859) was an early American inventor who, with his partner Edwin Wesson, patented the first revolver after Samuel Colt's, and subsequently manufactured one of the first American revolving pistols. The innovative design was manufactured only briefly before a patent suit by Colt forced the company to stop producing the Leavitt & Wesson Dragoon revolver. But Leavitt's early patents, and those of his partner Wesson, stoked competition and helped drive the technological and manufacturing boom that produced the modern firearms industry.\n\nLeavitt was born November 16, 1813, at Rye, New Hampshire, the son of Benning Leavitt, influential businessman, state senator, county commissioner and later Chicopee Selectman, and his wife Olive (Jenness) Leavitt. Daniel Leavitt married in 1838 at West Springfield, Massachusetts, Ruth Jeannette Ball. They had three children.\n\nLeavitt took out a patent on his new design on April 29, 1837, when the U.S. Patent Office granted him United States patent number 182 for an 'improvement in many-chambered cylinder firearm.' The early weapon, the second of its kind, was a .40-caliber percussion, 6-shot single-action revolver with a 6¾-inch octagon tip-up barrel.\n\nLeavitt took out his patent less than a year after Samuel Colt had obtained a patent on his seminal revolver, and before Colt had a chance to bring his new weapon to market. The patent was granted to Leavitt at his residence in Cabotville, Massachusetts, now part of Chicopee, Massachusetts. The design was radical in one respect. \"The revolving cylinder which I use does not differ from such as have been previously employed in many-chambered guns,\" Leavitt wrote in his patent application. \"The improvement which I have made consists in giving a convex form to that end of the revolving cylinder which is in contact with the barrel.\"\n\nLeavitt's innovation was the beveled face of the cylinder, which was designed to direct flash from the fired cylinder away from adjacent chambers, thus preventing multiple discharges, the major problem with early percussion revolvers. In his design, Leavitt attempted to solve the problem through the beveling and the new convex shape he imparted to the revolving cylinder.\n\nLeavitt's design, wrote Philadelphia's \"Journal of the Franklin Institute\" in 1838, was \"one of those fire arms which have several chambers bored in a cylinder, the axis of which is parallel to the axis of the barrel of the gun, and which chambers can be successively made to coincide with the said barrel.\" But Leavitt's innovation, noted the Journal, was to make the end of the cylinder convex to draw off the fumes and flash of the cartridge explosions.\n\nThe inventor's early patent demonstrated that the firearms industry was attracting considerable innovation and competition as it was getting off the ground. (In the same year that Leavitt's patent was granted, the U.S. Patent Office granted two other men patents on innovations in many-chambered firearms). On February 25, 1836, Samuel Colt had been granted a U.S. patent (later renumbered X9430) for his patent for a 'revolving gun.'\n\nThe revolvers were produced in small quantities by the firm of Wesson, Stephens & Miller in nearby Hartford, Connecticut. In 1839 Edwin Wesson, principal of the manufacturing concern and himself an inventor, make some modifications to Leavitt's initial design, dubbing the new product the 'Wesson & Leavitt' revolver, which he began producing at a factory in Massachusetts, a concern which led to the formation of the Massachusetts Arms Company of Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. After a patent grant to Wesson in 1850, awarded posthumously, the first Wesson & Leavitt revolvers rolled off the line at Chicopee Falls. The enormous 40-caliber handgun weighed over 4 pounds and was nearly 15 inches long, with 7.1 inches of that in the barrel itself.\n\nIn 1850/51 the firm produced some 800 copies of the new revolver, which could be reloaded by simply pressing a latch, raising the barrel and pulling the cylinder forward and off the axis pin. Along with the standard model, another thousand smaller .31-caliber Belt models were manufactured with a shorter barrel.\n\nThe new revolvers were embraced by customers. General Winfield Scott, for instance, carried one of the smaller Wesson & Leavitt 32-caliber six-shot revolvers in the Mexican-American War.\n\nThe success of the fledgling company's weapon soon attracted the attention of Samuel Colt, who sent his cousin Henry Sargeant to purchase one of the revolvers. Emboldened by the recent extension of his original patent until 1857, Colt sued Wesson & Leavitt, now run by Edwin's brother Daniel Wesson, who had gone to work for his brother Edwin in 1843 and who took over after Edwin's 1849 death. Colt's lawsuit alleged infringement of Colt's original patent on the revolver. The case went to trial in October 1852 before the United States circuit court for the District of New York. Both sides alleged tampering with the original U.S. Patent files as well as fraudulent exhibits. The case was extensively covered by the New York City newspapers. A month later, Colt had overwhelmed the tiny manufacturer in court and won large damages. Massachusetts Arms Co. continued to manufacture revolvers based on alternate version of their revolvers with various less useful methods for revolving the cylinder to get around Colt's patents. The original company dissolved after the Civil War in 1866.\n\nFollowing Colt's victory, his attorney Edward N. Dickerson fired off a circular at the manufacturers in the firearms business. \"You will please to take notice,\" Dickerson wrote, \"to desist forthwith from the sale of any REPEATING FIRE ARMS, in which rotation, or locking or releasing, are produced by combining the breech with the lock; or in which the cones are separated by partitions, or set into recesses; except such as are made by Col. Colt, at Hartford.\"\n\n\"Needless to say,\" write the authors of \"Samuel Colt: Arms, Art, and Invention\", \"this circular had a chilling effect on the American arms industry.\" A number of the firms warned by Dickerson capitulated and paid damages to settle with Colt. But despite this early victory, Colt's attorney warned his client not to persist with his patent infringement suits. \"Nothing is easier than to get into a big law suit\", said Dickerson, \"but there are many easier things than to get out successfully. Your luck, as I suppose you will call it, has hitherto been very good – better than \"any other inventor\" in America by far, but it may turn, and another suit may bring out something which we know not of, and which may destroy us...\"\n\nDickerson may have been smarting from confrontations in the U.S. District Court battle, which turned into a jousting match between two of the foremost attorneys of the day: Dickerson representing Colt; and Rufus Choate representing the Massachusetts Arms Company. Nevertheless it was Dickerson – and his client Colt, who was away on business in Europe during the trial – who came out on top in the first courtroom dust-up.\n\nDespite the warning of Dickerson to his client not to press his luck, Colt's litigious salvos had one effect: they virtually shut down the output of his competitors for several years, and his firm became the largest manufacturer of civilian firearms during the 1850s.\n\nAltogether the Massachusetts Arms Company – considered a predecessor of arms manufacturer Smith & Wesson – manufactured roughly a thousand of the .31-caliber belt models of the original patented revolver, 200 of which were purchased by the abolitionist Massachusetts-Kansas Aid Committee in 1856. Many of these firearms later found their way to abolitionist John Brown.\n\nThe Massachusetts Arms Company continued in business, and after the expiration of some of Samuel Colt's original patents, as well as improvements in the design of its revolvers, the company manufactured an assortment of weapons. Several of its early employees, notably designer Joshua Stevens, went on to found other successful weaponry companies. (The J. Stevens Company, founded by former Wesson & Leavitt employee Stevens, was ultimately sold to New England Westinghouse Company in 1915 to produce military arms for World War I).\n\nThe early inventor, although eventually crushed by the legal team of arms magnate Samuel Colt, had helped spur competition and drive technological improvements in the design of American pistols – guns later used in the Old West, the American Civil War and elsewhere, and the envy of the world's firearm manufacturers. Leavitt himself served in the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia in 1847 as Captain of Company F, 10th Regiment, 6th Brigade and was a member of the Chicopee Freemasons lodge.\n\nLeavitt did not confine himself to the design of firearms. On August 18, 1842 he was granted a patent (number 2755) for a 'Mode of Securing Bobbins in Shuttles for Weaving'. Leavitt's patent for an innovation for bobbins used in power looms demonstrated that the inventor had his eye on another emerging New England industry. It was an industry in which Leavitt had more than passing interest: his father Benning owned a Chicopee factory that produced bobbins. There is no indication whether Leavitt's patent for textile manufacturing was more successful than his firearm patents.\n\nLeavitt died at Chicopee, Massachusetts on July 27, 1859.\n\n\n"}

His early years were dominated by his experience of the countryside around the Lake District and the English moors. Dorothy Wordsworth, his sister, served as his early companion until their mother's death and their separation when he was sent to school.\n\nWordsworth's parents were John Wordsworth, a legal agent for James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and Collector of Customs at Whitehaven, and his wife, Ann Cookson. John was the son of Richard Wordsworth, a land owner who served as a legal agent to the Lowther family.\n\nLike his father, John became a legal agent for James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and was made Bailiff and Recorder for Cockermouth and Coroner for the Seigniory of Millon.\n\nAnn was the daughter of William Cookson, a linen-draper, and Dorothy Crackanthorpe, daughter of a gentry family in Westmorland. They lived above Cookson's shop in Penrith, Cumbria. Ann's brother, Christopher \"Kit\" Crackanthorpe Cookson (later, Christopher Crackanthorpe) inherited the family estate of Newbiggin Hall.\n\nJohn, at the age of 26, married Ann, 18, in 1766, and he used his connections with the Lowther family to move into a large mansion in the small town of Cockermouth, Cumbria, in the Lake District. John owned many properties, in Cockermouth and Ravenglass, and he inherited a property at Sockbridge, which was originally purchased by his father and given to John after his older brother, Richard, was disinherited by their father. However, the brother's relationship was not strained by this decision, and Richard would become guardian to John's children after his death.\n\nWilliam's mother died when he was 7 years old and he became an orphan at the age of 13 years.\n\nWordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in Cockermouth, the second of five children. His sister, the poet, and diarist Dorothy, to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptized together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who would become a poet and enjoy nature with William and Dorothy until he died in an 1805 shipwreck; and Christopher, the youngest, who would become a scholar and eventually Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. Although he lived at his father's mansion, Wordsworth, as with his siblings, had little involvement with their father, and they would be distant with him until his death in 1783.\n\nWordsworth's father, although rarely present, did teach him poetry, including that of Milton, Shakespeare, and Spenser, in addition to allowing his son to rely on his father's library. In addition to spending his time reading in Cockermouth, he would stay at his mother's parents home in Penrith, for extended periods of time, which took place primarily during 1775–1776 and during the winter months of 1776–1777. At Penrith, Wordsworth was exposed to the moors and was influenced by his experience with the landscape and was further turned towards nature by the harsh treatment he received at the hands of his relatives. In particular, Wordsworth could not get along with his grandparents and his uncle, and his hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.\n\nIn March 1778, Ann died of an illness, possibly pneumonia, at Penrith. After the death of his mother in 1778, his father was inconsolable and sent his children away to be raised by their relatives. William was taken in by his mother's family and eventually sent to Hawkshead Grammar School, and Dorothy was sent to live with Elizabeth Threlkeld, Ann's cousin, in Halifax. She and William did not meet again for another nine years. Although Hawkshead was Wordsworth's first serious experience with education, he was taught to read by his mother and attended a tiny school in Cockermouth of low quality.\n\nAt Penrith, Wordsworth was sent to a school for the children of upper-class families and taught by Ann Birkett, a woman who insisted in instilling tradition in her students that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day, or Shrove Tide. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the \"Spectator\", but little else. It was at the school that Wordsworth was to meet the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who would be his future wife. Life at Penrith wasn't a happy time for Wordsworth, because he was unsatisfied with his grandparents' treatment; he still spent time at his grandparents' home and their relationship was still tense. Wordsworth became rebellious to the point of destroying a family portrait.\n\nHis discontent with his familial situation provoked Wordsworth to spend his time wandering away from his home, an action Wordsworth relates as uniting a childish imagination with both nature and mankind in \"The Prelude\". He became attached to nature, and, when he was finally sent to school in Hawkshead, he was able to fully enjoy the countryside.\nBesides the local surroundings, Wordsworth was educated at the Hawkshead Grammar School, which had a reputation for scholarship and preparation for University entrance.\n\nA large portion of Wordsworth's education at Hawkshead was based on mathematics. The rest of the curriculum was based on teaching the classics, and it was during his classical studies that Wordsworth gained a love for Latin literature. Besides his literary education, Wordsworth and his brothers were given dancing lessons in 1785. While Wordsworth was taught at Hawkshead, he boarded with Hugh and Ann Tyson in the nearby hamlet of Colthouse, where he was exposed to the local yarn trade. The community had a strong Quaker influence, and Wordsworth, after experiencing their traditions, rejected their fixation on praising God for a relationship with the divine that would involve a more direct interaction.\n\nHawkshead School had a strong relationship with St.John's College at Cambridge University and, in October 1787, Wordsworth became an undergraduate there.\n\nWordsworth felt that his life before Samuel Taylor Coleridge was sedentary and dull and his poetry amounted to little. When Coleridge was near, he was Wordsworth's muse, and Coleridge's praise and encouragement kept Wordsworth motivated. Dorothy described Wordsworth while around Coleridge when she wrote: \"His faculties seem to expand every day, he composes with much more facility than he did\". It was under Coleridge's support that Wordsworth was encouraged to write poetry intended to rival Milton.\n\nWhen Wordsworth was forced to move from Alfoxden, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy agreed to travel to Germany in September 1798. Originally, Coleridge and Wordsworth lived together in Hamburg, until Coleridge decided to look for a place to live at Ratzeburg. Wordsworth wanted to join his friend, but was forced to decline over monetary issues; Wordsworth was unable to provide for both himself and his sister in such an expensive town, and they instead moved to Goslar. The separation, with the expenses, made it impossible for Wordsworth to spend time with Coleridge until after the winter of 1798.\n\nWordsworth continued to write even without the support of Coleridge's company, and from October 1798 to February 1799 Wordsworth began writing the \"Matthew\" poems along with the \"Lucy\" poems and other poems. These poems express the frustration and anxiety that Wordsworth was feeling In particular, it is possible that the \"Lucy\" poems allowed Wordsworth to vent his frustration with his sister, and that they contain the subconscious desire for his sister to die. The two poems are thematically unique compared to Wordsworth's other poems, especially in their portrayal of loss and a lack of faith that nature is able to provide comfort or solutions to life's problems. This reversal of Wordsworth's view of nature provoked Alan Grob to suggest that the two sets of poems should be known \"as the Goslar lyrics of 1799\".\n\nBesides an emphasis on nature, as Bennett Weaver points out, \"The dominant theme of the poems of 1799 is death: death for the children of the village school, for Matthew's daughter, and for Lucy Gray.\"\n\nIn his \"Preface to Lyrical Ballads\", which is called the \"manifesto\" of English Romantic criticism, Wordsworth calls his poems \"experimental\". The year 1793 saw Wordsworth's first published poetry, with the collections \"An Evening Walk\" and \"Descriptive Sketches\". He received a legacy of £900 from Raisley Calvert in 1795 so that he could pursue writing poetry. That year, he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. In 1797, Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy moved to Alfoxton House, Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in Nether Stowey. Together, Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1798), an important work in the English Romantic movement. The volume gave neither Wordsworth's nor Coleridge's name as author. One of Wordsworth's most famous poems, \"Tintern Abbey\", was published in the work, along with Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". The second edition, published in 1800, had only Wordsworth listed as the author, and included a preface to the poems, which was augmented significantly in the 1802 edition. This Preface to Lyrical Ballads is considered a central work of Romantic literary theory. In it, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of poetry, one based on the \"real language of men\" and which avoids the poetic diction of much 18th-century poetry. Here, Wordsworth gives his famous definition of poetry as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.\" A fourth and final edition of Lyrical Ballads was published in 1805.\n\nIn 1799, Wordsworth completed a version of his \"Prelude\", which was, according to Stephen Gill, \"the most sustained self-examination in English poetry\". In Wordsworth's 1799 \"Prelude\", he attempted to write a biography about the growth of his mind from childhood to the current time. However, he realized that this could never be complete and wrote:\nThe 1799 \"Prelude\" describes Wordsworth's early, happy moments in Cockermouth with a particular focus on the River Derwent and Cockermouth Castle. The poem transitions into the happy moments at Hawkshead, skipping over Wordsworth's experience with his mother's family, and only one scene containing his experience in Penrith was introduced in Book XII of the 1805 edition.\n\n"}

{"id": "397597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397597", "title": "Edward Carpenter", "text": "Edward Carpenter\n\nEdward Carpenter (29 August 1844 – 28 June 1929) was an English socialist poet, philosopher, anthologist, and early activist for rights for homosexuals.\n\nA poet and writer, he was a close friend of Rabindranath Tagore, and a friend of Walt Whitman. He corresponded with many famous figures such as Annie Besant, Isadora Duncan, Havelock Ellis, Roger Fry, Mahatma Gandhi, Keir Hardie, J. K. Kinney, Jack London, George Merrill, E. D. Morel, William Morris, Edward R. Pease, John Ruskin, and Olive Schreiner.\n\nAs a philosopher he was particularly known for his publication of \"Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure\" in which he proposes that civilisation is a form of disease that human societies pass through.\n\nAn early advocate of sexual freedoms, he had an influence on both D. H. Lawrence and Sri Aurobindo, and inspired E. M. Forster's novel \"Maurice\".\n\nBorn in Hove in Sussex, Carpenter was educated at nearby Brighton College where his father was a governor. His brothers Charles, George and Alfred also went to school there. When he was ten, he displayed a flair for the piano.\n\nHis academic ability appeared relatively late in his youth, but was sufficient to earn him a place at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Whilst there he began to explore his feelings for men. One of the most notable examples of this is his close friendship with Edward Anthony Beck (later Master of Trinity Hall), which, according to Carpenter, had \"a touch of romance\". Beck eventually ended their friendship, causing Carpenter great emotional heartache. Carpenter graduated as 10th Wrangler in 1868. After university he joined the Church of England as a curate, \"as a convention rather than out of deep Conviction\".\n\nIn 1871 he was invited to become tutor to the royal princes George Frederick (late King George V) and his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, but declined the position. The job instead went to his lifelong friend and fellow Cambridge student John Neale Dalton. Carpenter continued to visit Dalton while he was tutor, and was presented with photographs of themselves by the princes.\n\nIn the following years he experienced an increasing sense of dissatisfaction with his life in the church and university, and became weary of what he saw as the hypocrisy of Victorian society. He found great solace in reading poetry, later remarking that his discovery of the work of Walt Whitman caused \"a profound change\" in him. (\"My Days and Dreams\" p. 64)\nCarpenter left the church in 1874 and became a lecturer in astronomy, sun worship, the lives of ancient Greek women and music, moving to Leeds as part of University Extension Movement, which was formed by academics who wished to introduce higher education to deprived areas of England. He hoped to lecture to the working classes, but found that his lectures were attended by middle class people, many of whom showed little active interest in the subjects he taught. Disillusioned, he moved to Chesterfield, but finding that town dull, he based himself in nearby Sheffield a year later. Here he finally came into contact with manual workers, and he began to write poetry. His sexual preferences were for working men: \"the grimy and oil-besmeared figure of a stoker\" or \"the thick-thighed hot coarse-fleshed young bricklayer with a strap around his waist\".\n\nIn Sheffield, Carpenter became increasingly radical. Influenced by a disciple of Engels, Henry Hyndman, he joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in 1883 and attempted to form a branch in the city. The group instead chose to remain independent, and became the Sheffield Socialist Society. While in the city he worked on a number of projects including highlighting the poor living conditions of industrial workers.\n\nIn May 1889, Carpenter wrote a piece in the \"Sheffield Independent\" calling Sheffield the laughingstock of the civilized world and said that the giant thick cloud of smog rising out of Sheffield was like the smoke arising from Judgment Day, and that it was the altar on which the lives of many thousands would be sacrificed. He said that 100,000 adults and children were struggling to find sunlight and air, enduring miserable lives, unable to breathe and dying of related illnesses. In 1884, he left the SDF with William Morris to join the Socialist League.\n\nWhen his father Charles Carpenter died in 1882, he left his son a considerable fortune. This enabled Carpenter to quit his lectureship to start a simpler life of market gardening in Millthorpe, near Barlow, Derbyshire. Carpenter popularised the phrase the \"Simple Life\" in his essay \"Simplification of Life\" in his \"England's Ideal\" (1887). He asked Harold Cox to send him a pair of sandals from India, and used this pair as a template to begin making sandals at Millthorpe.\n\nDrawn increasingly to Hindu philosophy, he traveled to India and Ceylon in 1890. Following conversations with the guru Ramaswamy (known as the Gnani) there, he developed the conviction that socialism would bring about a revolution in human consciousness as well as of economic conditions. His account of the travel was published in 1892 as \"From Adam's Peak to Elephanta: Sketches in Ceylon and India\". The book's spiritual explorations would subsequently influence the Russian author Peter Ouspensky, who discusses it extensively in his own book, \"Tertium Organum\" (1912).\n\nOn his return from India in 1891, he met George Merrill, a working-class man also from Sheffield, 22 years his junior, and the two men struck up a relationship, eventually cohabiting in 1898. Merrill had been raised in the slums of Sheffield and had no formal education. Their relationship endured and they remained partners for the rest of their lives, a fact made all the more extraordinary by the hysteria about homosexuality generated by the Oscar Wilde trial of 1895. Carpenter remarked in his work \"The Intermediate Sex\":\n\nEros is a great leveller. Perhaps the true Democracy rests, more firmly than anywhere else, on a sentiment which easily passes the bounds of class and caste, and unites in the closest affection the most estranged ranks of society. It is noticeable how often Uranians of good position and breeding are drawn to rougher types, as of manual workers, and frequently very permanent alliances grow up in this way, which although not publicly acknowledged have a decided influence on social institutions, customs and political tendencies.\n\nCarpenter included among his friends the scholar, author, naturalist, and founder of the Humanitarian League, Henry S. Salt, and his wife, Catherine; the critic, essayist and sexologist, Havelock Ellis, and his wife, Edith; actor and producer Ben Iden Payne; Labour activists, John Bruce and Katharine Glasier; writer and scholar, John Addington Symonds; and the writer and feminist, Olive Schreiner. E. M. Forster was also close friends with the couple, who on a visit to Millthorpe in 1912 was inspired to write his gay-themed novel, \"Maurice\". Forster records in his diary that Merrill \"...touched my backside - gently and just above the buttocks. I believe he touched most people's. The sensation was unusual and I still remember it, as I remember the position of a long vanished tooth. He made a profound impression on me and touched a creative spring.\"\n\nThe relationship between Carpenter and Merrill was the template for the relationship between Maurice Hall and Alec Scudder, the gamekeeper in Forster's novel. Carpenter was also a significant influence on the author D. H. Lawrence, whose \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" can be seen as a heterosexualised \"Maurice\".\n\nIn 1902 his anthology of verse and prose, \"Ioläus: An Anthology of Friendship\", was published. The book was published again in 1906 by William Swan Sonnenschein.\n\nIn 1915, he published \"The Healing of Nations and the Hidden Sources of Their Strife\", where he argued that the source of war and discontent in western society was class-monopoly and social inequality.\n\nCarpenter was an advocate of the Christ myth theory. He authored the book \"Pagan and Christian Creeds\", 1920.\n\nAfter the First World War, he had moved to Guildford, Surrey, with George Merrill and the two lived at 23 Mountside Road. In January 1928, Merrill died suddenly. Carpenter was devastated and he sold their house and lodged for a short time, with his companion and carer Ted Inigan, at 17 Woodland Avenue, just a short walk from Mountside. They then moved to a bungalow called ‘Inglenook’ in Josephs Road.\n\nIn May 1928, Carpenter suffered a paralytic stroke. He lived another 13 months before he died on 28 June 1929, aged 84. He was interred, in the same grave as Merrill, at the Mount Cemetery at Guildford in Surrey.\n\nAnsel Adams was an admirer of Carpenter's writings, especially \"Towards Democracy\". Leslie Paul was influenced by Carpenter's ideas; in turn he passed on Carpenter's ideas to the scouting group he founded, The Woodcraft Folk.\n\nCarpenter has also been known as the \"Saint in Sandals\", the \"Noble Savage\" and, more recently, the \"gay godfather of the British left\".\n\n\n"}

Because his Chinese name was too difficult for western traders to pronounce, the name Howqua comes from his Chinese Business Name \"浩官\" (), very similar to a DBA. He became rich on the trade between China and the British Empire in the middle of the 19th century during the First Opium War. Perhaps the wealthiest man in China during the nineteenth century, Howqua was the senior of the Hong merchants in Canton, one of the few authorized to trade silk and porcelain with foreigners. According to historic records, there was a fire in 1822 and many of the cohongs were burned down. The melted silver allegedly formed a little stream almost two miles in length. Of the 3 million dollars of compensation that was required to pay the British from the Treaty of Nanking, he single-handedly contributed one million, one third of the total sum.

{"id": "559025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=559025", "title": "Hugh Williamson", "text": "Hugh Williamson\n\nHugh Williamson (December 5, 1735 – May 22, 1819) was an American physician and politician. He is best known as a signatory to the U.S. Constitution, and for representing North Carolina at the Constitutional Convention.\n\nWilliamson was a scholar of international renown. His erudition had brought him into contact with some of the leading intellectuals of the Patriot cause and, in turn, with the ferment of political ideas that eventually found expression in the Constitution. During the American Revolution, Williamson contributed his talents as physician and natural scientist to the American war effort. His experiences in that preeminent event of his generation transformed the genial scholar into an adroit politician and a determined leader in the campaign for effective national government. This leadership was evident not only at the Convention in Philadelphia but also, with telling effect, during the ratification debates in North Carolina.\n\nWilliamson's career demonstrates the rootlessness that characterized the lives of many Americans even in the 18th century. Born on the frontier, he lived for significant periods of his long life in three different regions of the country. This mobility undoubtedly contributed to the development of his nationalistic outlook, an outlook strengthened by wartime service with interstate military forces and reinforced by the interests of the planters and merchants that formed his North Carolina constituency. These experiences convinced him that only a strong central government could adequately protect and foster the political, economic, and intellectual future of the new nation.\n\nWilliamson was born in West Nottingham Township, in what was then the frontier region of the Province of Pennsylvania. His fragile health as a youth weighed against his beginning a career in the family's clothier business. His parents instead sent him to Francis Alison's New London Academy and, in 1754, to the College of Philadelphia (today's University of Pennsylvania). Williamson graduated in the school's first class, on May 17, 1757, five days before his father died. \n\nIn another career shift four years later, Williamson turned to the study of medicine. After spending a year at the University of Edinburgh, he matriculated at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, wrote a brief thesis, and received his Medical Decree on August 6, 1764. He returned to Philadelphia to open a private practice. At the same time, he pursued a number of independent scientific and educational projects, and his work in these areas eventually led to membership in the American Philosophical Society as well as acclaim in Europe's intellectual circles.\n\nInterest in science and education indirectly led Williamson to politics and the Patriot cause. Sailing for England in 1773 to raise funds for a local educational project, Williamson stopped en route at Boston. There he witnessed the famous Boston Tea Party, in which Patriots dressed as American Indians destroyed a cargo of tea in protest over a newly enforced Parliamentary tax on imported commodities. On reaching London he was summoned before the Privy Council to testify on this act of rebellion and on colonial affairs in general.\n\nWilliamson came of age politically during this encounter. In response to questions by Council members, who were in the process of formulating punitive measures against Massachusetts, he bluntly warned that repression would provoke rebellion. He then went on to express the argument that was becoming the core of the Patriot position: Americans were entitled to the full rights of Englishmen, including representation in the decisions of the English government. This testimony brought him to the attention of other Americans in London. A mutual interest in scientific matters cemented a solid working relationship with Benjamin Franklin, and Williamson soon found himself joined with the famous American scientist and others in appealing for support among those Englishmen who, in opposition to their own government, sympathized with American claims. \nWilliamson continued on to the Netherlands where, taking advantage of the cover afforded by his attendance at meetings on scientific and educational subjects, he organized the publication of pamphlets and other papers that supported the Patriot cause. While there he learned that the colonies had declared their independence. He rushed back to Philadelphia in early 1777 and volunteered for service in the Medical Department of the Continental Army. The Department had no opening at that time, so Williamson decided to form a partnership with a younger brother to import medicines and other scarce items from the West Indies through the British blockade. Believing that he could best contribute to the war effort by using his contacts and reputation in this manner, Williamson made Edenton, North Carolina, his base of operations. Settlement in North Carolina soon led to his establishing a medical practice to serve the planters and merchants of the region.\n\nThese various activities brought Williamson to the attention of North Carolina's political leaders. Facing the threat of a British invasion of the region from the sea and bases in Florida, the state legislature voted to raise a force of 4,000 men to assist South Carolina. When Governor Richard Caswell, with the rank of major general, took to the field at the head of these citizen-soldiers, he named Williamson to serve as the state's Physician and Surgeon General, a post Williamson held until the end of the war.\n\nThe capture of Charleston, South Carolina in 1780 not only marked a stunning defeat for American forces, but also signaled the end of the first phase in a new British war strategy. Under this strategy British forces would continue to tie down Washington's main army in the north while a Royal army under General Charles Cornwallis would advance northward. Using Savannah, Georgia and Charleston as their bases of operations, the British expected their regular units to push through North Carolina and Virginia while a militia composed of local Loyalists secured areas captured by the regular forces. If successful, this strategy would have led to the conquest of the colonies from the south. To counter Cornwallis' efforts, the Continental Congress sent Horatio Gates to command a small force composed of a division of continentals, Caswell's units from North Carolina, and a group of hastily assembled Virginia militia units.\n\nGates attempted to attack the British advance base near Camden, South Carolina, but his tired militia units, which were still forming when the battle began, were routed, and the Americans suffered another defeat. Williamson, who witnessed the disaster, volunteered to pass behind enemy lines to care for the American wounded. He spent two months on this mercy mission. When smallpox threatened the prison camp, he argued strenuously with Cornwallis and other British officers over the proper method to combat the disease. His perseverance and scientific reputation paid off. The British followed his advice, and an epidemic was averted.\n\nIn the fall of 1780 Williamson returned to the field. Major General Nathanael Greene, Gates' replacement, had begun his brilliant campaign to recover the south through the joint efforts of continentals and militia. While his main force engaged the British in a series of battles, the militiamen concentrated on picking off small outposts and isolated enemy parties. Francis Marion, nicknamed \"Swamp Fox\", and others who operated mainly in South Carolina are most remembered for this type of guerrilla warfare, but North Carolina units also adopted these tactics. Williamson was attached to a force under Brigadier General Isaac Gregory whose mission was to limit British activity in eastern North Carolina. Gregory established his base in the vast reaches of the Dismal Swamp where he could pin the British down in Wilmington without jeopardizing his small force. Williamson's bold innovations in preventive medicine, especially his strenuous efforts to indoctrinate raw troops in the importance of sanitation and diet, kept the command virtually free of disease during the six months that it inhabited the swamp-—a rare feat in 18th-century warfare.\n\nIn 1782 Williamson's neighbors elected him to the lower house of the North Carolina legislature, where he served for several terms. He sat on numerous committees, including those formed to regulate veterans' rights, and he authored the state's copyright law. His fellow legislators also chose Williamson to serve in the Continental Congress in 1782. Appointment to this national body represented a natural political progression for Williamson, who was evolving into a champion of federalism. His experiences during the Revolution, especially his exposure to the pressing need for interstate cooperation during the 1780 and 1781 campaigns in the Carolinas, had convinced him of the military importance of strong national government. This interest increased when he came to realize the economic benefits that might accrue from binding interstate association. In 1786 North Carolina chose Williamson to attend the Annapolis Convention, a meeting called to settle economic questions affecting the middle Atlantic states. Although he arrived too late to play a role in the Maryland proceedings, he was prepared to discuss interstate issues the following year when his state appointed him as a representative at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nWilliamson, a faithful attendee at Convention sessions, lodged with Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, two of the country's best-known nationalist leaders. His intellectual stature and international background also propelled him into a leadership role in the North Carolina delegation. A capacity for hard work and his innate good humor made him invaluable to the Federalists as they worked out the many political compromises necessary for consensus on the new instrument of government. On 11 July 1787, James Wilson of Pennsylvania proposed the three fifths compromise. It failed to pass (4:6), but a substantially similar motion was passed two days later. Williamson, like many other Founders, was opposed to the institution of slavery.\n\nShortly before the Convention adjourned, Williamson wrote a series of public letters in defense of a strong federal system. These \"Letters of Sylvius\" addressed many of the practical concerns of his state, where the rural and frequently debt-ridden farmers favored minimal government regulations, while the mercantile-planter group from the seaboard region wanted an economy strictly regulated by a central government. Using simple examples, Williamson explained to both groups the dual dangers of inflationary finances and of taxes that would stunt the growth of domestic manufacture. He exhorted North Carolinians to support the Constitution as the basis for their future prosperity. The ratification process, he explained, would decide whether the United States would remain a \"system of patchwork and a series of expedients\" or become \"the most flourishing, independent, and happy nation on the face of the earth.\"\n\nFollowing adjournment in Philadelphia, Williamson returned to New York to participate in the closing sessions of the Continental Congress and to serve as one of the agents settling North Carolina's accounts with that body. These duties caused him to miss the Hillsboro Convention, where North Carolina first considered and rejected the Constitution, but he played a major role at a second convention that met in Fayetteville in 1789. Here he participated in a successful effort to rally support for the Constitution.\nWilliamson's neighbors elected him to represent them in the first federal Congress. He served two terms before retiring and settling in New York City, where he continued to pursue a wide range of scholarly interests. He wrote extensively about his research, joined numerous learned societies, and contributed to many charities. He also served as one of the original trustees of the University of North Carolina.\n\nThomas Jefferson described Williamson's role at the Philadelphia Convention in the following terms: \"he was a useful member, of an acute mind, attentive to business, and of an high degree of erudition.\"\n\nWilliamson married Maria Apthorpe in January 1789; she died after the birth of their second child in 1790. They had two sons, both of whom died young (the older one at the age of 22 in 1811, the younger, shortly thereafter, according to Hosack's Memoir of Hugh Williamson). Williamson was a Presbyterian, though some sources have identified him as a Deist.\n\nWilliamson died and was buried in New York City.\n\n\nWilliamson was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813.\n\n"}
{"id": "12109442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12109442", "title": "Joaquín Amaro", "text": "Joaquín Amaro\n\nJoaquín Amaro Domínguez (August 16, 1889 – March 15, 1952) was a Mexican revolutionary general and military reformer. He served as Secretary of War in the cabinets of Presidents Plutarco Elías Calles, Emilio Portes Gil, and Pascual Ortiz Rubio, making him one of the longest-serving cabinet-level officials in Mexican history. His ambitious reforms of the fractious Mexican military transformed the armed forces from a political partisan to an armed force loyal to the president and government. He accomplished this \"through a process of cultural reeducation that replaced an entrenched tradition of militarism with one emphasizing such values as discipline, duty, honor, and loyalty to the civilian government.\"\n\nAmaro was born in Corrales de Abrego in the municipality of Sombrerete, Zacatecas, the first of Antonio Amaro and Angela Domínguez's ten children. His family was of indigenous ancestry, although they were probably not Yaqui, as was widely assumed. While Amaro was still a child, the family moved to the nearby state of Durango, where his father worked on an hacienda. He learned to read and write, although probably without the benefit of formal schooling. Beginning in 1908, he worked in the office of the Saucillo hacienda where his father was employed, assisting with bookkeeping. With two incomes, the family was able to enjoy a comfortable existence. In 1910, his father sold his possessions and gave the money to his eldest son, advising him, \"go to Durango with your mother and siblings, work for Mr. Calderón [a local store-owner], learn the business, get to know the town, and when you feel able, open your own store.\" His father left for Torreón in November of that year, and although Amaro never saw him again, he read about his exploits with the revolutionary army of Colonel Luis Moya.\n\nOn February 28, 1911, Amaro enlisted in the Maderist army of General Domingo Arrieta. Shortly after Amaro enlisted, his father was killed in battle. After five months as a private, he was promoted every subsequent month, attaining the rank of lieutenant by December.\n\nAs part of the army of Colonel Gertrudis G. Sánchez, whose forces Arrieta's had joined, Amaro fought against the Zapatistas in Morelos, engaging them at least nineteen times. In one of these engagements, the battle of Jojutla de Juárez, he earned the \"\"Cruz de Segunda Clase\",\" a heroism medal. From 1913 to 1914, he fought the federal troops under the command of Victoriano Huerta, continuing all the while to rise in rank. By 1914 he had risen to the rank of general.\n\nIt was under the command of General Sánchez that Amaro developed the reputation of a fierce warrior. It was rumored that he wore an earring and used the battlecry \"Here is the man of the pendant earring! Here is the Indian!\" He also supposedly emulated the fighting style of the Yaqui people. He also developed the reputation of a harsh disciplinarian who occasionally used his riding crop to mete out corporal punishments to his subordinates. He may have even shot men in his charge or employ for disobeying orders.\n\nAfter the fall of Huerta, while still under the command of Sánchez, he briefly supported the conventionalist government of Eulalio Gutiérrez, before breaking with Sánchez to ally with the constitutionalist army of Venustiano Carranza. Shortly after Sánchez and Amaro joined the Constitutionalists, Sánchez ordered Amaro to attack a column of troops commanded by General Francisco Murguía, who, while also a Constitutionalists, was a rival of Sánchez. While initially successful, Murguía's troops eventually prevailed, and Murguía sought to have Amaro executed for treason, a charge he narrowly escaped. Rather than damaging the reputation of Amaro, however, the incident did more to isolate Sánchez, who Amaro abandoned. The split finally came in 1915, when Amaro advanced the troops under his command on the Villista \"División del Norte\", leaving Sánchez in Michoacán. By this time, he had already professed allegiance to General Álvaro Obregón and the carrancista government.\n\nIn April 1915, he led his troops, known as the \"Rayados\" (\"striped ones\"—so-called because the only uniforms Obregón could provide were prison uniforms) to support Obregón's defeat of the villistas in the second Battle of Celaya. Following the battle, Obregón named him \"Comandante militar\" (\"military commander\") of the 5th Division of the Army of the Northwest, and he was charged of ridding Michoacán of villista influence. At the end of 1915, the area under his command was expanded to include Guanajuato and Querétaro.\n\nIn 1916, he again fought the zapatistas in Morelos and Guerrero. In 1917, he was placed under the command of Murguía, and led expeditions against the remaining villistas of Durango and Chihuahua.\n\nWhen Obregón proclaimed the Plan of Agua Prieta against Carranza in 1920, Amaro remained loyal to Obregón, and was rewarded with the rank of \"General de división\", the highest military rank. He became chief military officer of the third military zone, which included the states of Coahuila, Nuevo León and San Luis Potosí. In this capacity, he undertook to professionalize the unorganized ranks under him, gaining experience that would later benefit his reorganization of the entire military.\n\nOn September 3, 1921, while chief of operations of the third military zone, Amaro wed Elisa Izaguirre, originally of Morelia, Michoacán. There the couple had two children, Joaquín and Leonor.\n\nHe later became commander of the seventh military zone, which comprised Nuevo León. There he put down the July rebellion of Pablo González. When in 1922 political unrest threatened to \ndestabilize Coahuila, Amaro positioned his troops to block the occupation of the state legislature and to protect the governor's palace. In 1923, he was sent to maintain order during Nuevo León's gubernatorial elections. Following a series of violent incidents, Amaro disarmed groups of rural fighters.\n\nAfter the assassination of Pancho Villa in July 1923, Amaro was widely suspected as one of the planners of the operation. Today, most historians attribute Villa's death to a well planned conspiracy, most likely initiated by then Minister of War Plutarco Elías Calles, who ordered Amaro to give support to the assassins. Amaro was later instrumental in freeing Jesús Salas Barraza, the leader of the group of assassins, from jail.\n\nAmaro never wavered from his support for Calles and Obregón, and he fully shared Calles' hatred of the clergy. Calles gave Amaro full support in continuing the latter's plan to reform the Mexican armed forces along anti-clerical and populist lines: I have fought without rest [...] against clericalism, large landowners, the militarism of the ex-Federals, the Spanish, and in general all those that do not contribute to the\nenrichment of our beloved homeland and the betterment of the working\nclass.\n\nDespite these sentiments, neither Calles nor Amaro hesitated in taking action against the extreme left-wing. When José Guadalupe Rodríguez tried to organise \"soldier soviets\" on the Bolshevist pattern, he was promptly arrested and shot along with some of his soldiers. Moreover, when a peasant and labor bloc of the Communist International was formed under the artist Diego Rivera, it was forcibly disbanded. Many on the extreme left were sent to the Marias Islands penal colony.\n\nIn 1923, Amaro's chief of staff José Álvarez learned of the plot between generals Enrique Estrada, Guadalupe Sánchez, and Fortunato Maycotte to overthrow Obregón. Álvarez immediately returned to Nuevo León and informed Amaro of the plot, who promptly related the information to Obregón. The conspirators drafted Adolfo de la Huerta, then-Minister of Finance, to run for president against Plutarco Elias Calles, Obregón's chosen successor. Facing a rebellion with armies in the North, South, and East, Obregón relied on loyal generals such as Amaro to block rebel access to resources and the northern border and to put down the insurrection. Amaro, aided by General Lázaro Cárdenas, battled Estrada's forces, defeating them in the decisive battle of Ocotlán. Three days after the battle, Amaro's troops occupied Guadalajara, where Estrada's operation had been based. The rebellion crushed, the 1924 Mexican election was carried out peacefully.\n\nFollowing the election of Calles, Amaro was appointed Undersecretary of War. Francisco Serrano having been sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission late in Obregón's presidency, the Secretariat was unfilled. Calles may have been waiting to secure the support of generals Eugenio Martínez and Arnulfo Gómez, who were also potential candidates for the post. While undersecretary, Amaro initiated a series of legal reforms to purge the armed forces of \"the germ of immorality and corruption.\" After an initial convention of important military figures, the Commission for Studies and Reforms of Military Laws and Regulations was formed. Ten months later, four new laws were promulgated.\n\nThe first, the Law of Discipline, was divided into three sections: General Duties, Corrective Discipline, and Court of Honor. The first three articles of the General Duties defined military duty in terms of \"self-sacrifice, loyalty, guardianship, and adherence to the law.\" The subsequent articles dealt with specific issues. One clarified the officer's duty to maintain order within his ranks; another prohibited soldiers from complaining about orders. One article prohibited servicemembers from interfering in politics. The final articles concerned decorum, and required subordinates to salute and give up their seats to superiors.\n\nThe Corrective Discipline section described the circumstances in which soldiers could be arrested for breaking the law, and required that such arrests be recorded in the offender's file.\n\nThe Court of Honor section was written for people who committed offenses that threatened the reputation of a unit or of the \"dignity of the military.\" It established a system of courts martial to punish drunkenness, gambling, mismanagement of funds, and negligence. Punishments for those found guilty ranged from transfer to demotion to imprisonment.\n\nThe second law, the Law of Retirements and Pensions, allowed servicemembers who had given twenty to thirty-five years of service to retire at will. It also required retirement at a certain age that was dependent on rank. Finally, it provided for pensions for disabled servicemen and their families.\n\nThe third law, the Law of Promotions and Rewards, set up two distinct rubrics for promotion: one for peacetime and one for wartime. Peacetime promotions were tied directly to military education. Wartime promotions could be granted for heroic actions such as preventing enemy capture of artillery pieces, and could only be given by high-ranking officers. These promotions had to be approved by higher bodies. These reforms were an effort to end the practice of opportunistic and haphazard promotions which had inflated the number of generals in Mexico's officer corps during the Revolution.\n\nThe purpose of the fourth law, the Organic Law, was to organize the armed services. The first section sought to redefine the relationship between generals and the soldiers under them, demanding that all personnel be loyal to the nation and the constitution and take their orders from the President or his designees.\n\nIt further delineated the five military branches: high command, combat arms, auxiliary services, special corps, and for the first time, military education establishments, and specified the structures of each. It stratified servicemembers into three classifications: active, reserve, and retired. Another section of the law structured the navy.\n\nAmaro was appointed Secretary of War by President Calles on July 27, 1925. Upon his appointment to the Secretariat, Amaro moved to Rancho de la Hormiga, a 40,468 square kilometer (ten acre) ranch that later became the presidential palace Los Pinos. There his children Guillermo, Manuel, and Elisa were born. He installed recreational facilities such as stables, polo fields, and tennis courts, as well as a military school at the ranch.\n\nPrior to his appointment as Undersecretary of War, Amaro had laid plans for a Grand Military Academy of the Army. He made arrangements for the government to purchase to tracts of land, but the school never materialized. Rather, he focused his efforts on the Heroic Military Academy. Despite its excellent reputation, by the end of the Revolution, the College was in a state of disrepair. On September 30, 1925, Amaro shut it down for a major overhaul that took ten months. In addition to new facilities, it also boasted a new curriculum that emphasized civic and moral virtues. Admission requirements were put into place, and included letters of recommendation that could vouch for an applicant's moral character.\n\nAmaro's efforts to reform the Mexican military and society extended beyond the realm of military education: he also founded publications that combatted the influence of the Catholic Church and of large landowners in the public consciousness. He had already founded two publications, \"Acción\" and \"El Agrarista\", as well as publishing a tract entitled \"El Gato\" in the early 1920s. However, 1925 saw a large increase in the number of military journals published in Mexico. Those already in existence, such as the \"Revista del Ejército y de la Marina\" (Magazine of the Army and the Navy), took a new editorial stance under the direction of Professor Ignacio Richkarday, who Amaro had appointed editor, to moralize the army. While \"Revista\" was aimed at the officer corps, Amaro founded \"El Soldado\", which emphasized the same themes, as a supplement for enlisted men. 1926 saw the founding of two more publications, \"Revista del Heróico Colegio Militar\" and \"Gladiador\".\n\nIn 1927, Generals Francisco Serrano and Arnulfo Gómez conspired with General Eugenio Martínez to seize Calles, Obregón, and Amaro in hopes of igniting a rebellion against the reelection of Obregón. Martínez informed Calles of the plot before it could be enacted, and Serrano and Gómez were caught and executed.\n\nAlthough Amaro sought to reform all branches of the Mexican military, he remained a political revolutionary general of the old school. As an army general, he understood little or nothing about aviation. He was slow to advance the progress of the Mexican Air Force, which had only three squadrons of obsolete aircraft during Amaro's tenure as Minister of War.\n\nWhen President Obregón was assassinated by pro-clergy forces sixteen days after his 1928 re-election, many generals and other important figures in Mexican politics urged Amaro to run for the office. He always politely declined, stating that he had \"never thought to dedicate [his] activities to politics.\" In February 1929, Amaro was injured during a game of fronton. He took a leave of absence from the Secretariat to seek medical attention at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. During his three-month convalescence, which left him with a glass eye, Calles assumed the Secretariat, in which capacity he put down the Escobar rebellion against Emilio Portes Gil, who had been appointed interim president in the wake of Obregon's assassination.\n\nUpon his return to Mexico and the Secretariat in May, he found a situation in which Calles was still attempting to control national politics from behind the scenes. Pascual Ortiz Rubio, Portes Gil's successor, was suspicious of Amaro, as was Calles. Calles, purporting to have received information that Amaro was planning on assassinating him or overthrowing Ortiz Rubio, informed the President of the alleged plot. Ortiz Rubio deferred to Calles to take care of the situation, and the \"Jefe Máximo\" met with three other cabinet officials, convincing them to resign so as to make it appear that the \"cabinet crisis\" did not center around Amaro. They agreed, and the following day, Calles, Amaro, and the other three secretarys met at Amaro's estate. There, all four cabinet ministers agreed to resign.\n\nAmaro was succeeded by Calles, who appointed him director of the Heroic Military Academy.\n\nAmaro's military reforms cut the Mexican military budget from one-third to one-quarter of the total Mexican government budget, and they resulted in the dismissal of numerous junior officers. The reforms, his involvement in suppressing leftists and the now-confirmed suspicion of his role in Pancho Villa's assassination, made Amaro very unpopular in some circles and a target of vicious, false rumors. One example is the tale that Amaro sent Captain Emilio Carranza a telegram ordering Carranza on July 13, 1928 to begin immediately a non-stop flight from New York City to Mexico City, which ended with the captain's fatal crash in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. However, contemporary news reports in the Evening Courier, Camden, NJ and New York Times show the story of the \"fateful telegram\" to be a fabrication.\nAnother example is the story that Amaro shot and killed a groom whom disobeyed his order to walk his polo pony and instead rode it to the stables, which the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico and his military attache passed to the Department of State. However, there is good reason to believe that Ambassabor James R. Sheffield loathed the Mexican Revolutionary leaders and would have passed on any rumor to discredit them regardless of its veracity. He used racial stereotypes to describe them, calling Calles \"an Armenian and Indian\" and \"Amaro, Secretary of War, a pure blooded Indian and very cruel.\" \n\nAmaro sought to create a Superior War College along the lines of France's École Supérieure de Guerre to train an elite group of officers. To this end he sent a number of generals to study the militaries and military academies of European and South American states. Amaro led the Heroic Military Academy from 1931 until 1935, and directed military education for the Secretariat of War from 1931 to 1936.\n\nDuring World War II, he was responsible for defending the region of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec from Axis aggressions.\n\nAmaro died in 1952 and was buried in the Panteón Francés de la Piedad. In 1966, his body was exhumed and reburied in Panteón Francés de San Joaquín. In the 1960s, a statue of Amaro on horseback was erected in Mexico City's Chapultepec Park.\n\n"}

He had been only two weeks into the job when he exposed \"one of the biggest and longest-running loss-hiding arrangements in Japanese corporate history\", according to \"the Wall Street Journal\". The US$2.2 billion deal in 2008 to acquire British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group, and the US$687 million paid to a middle-man were questioned. After initial denials, the company admitted that prior acquisitions had been used to cover investment losses. As regulators and police on three continents begin to investigate and trace the movement of the money, there was speculation that organised crime was involved in the missing millions. Olympus defended itself against allegations of impropriety, citing its Audit Board's view that \"no dishonesty or illegality is found in the transaction itself, nor any breach of obligation to good management or any systematic errors by the directors recognised.\"\n\nAccording to the Olympus website, Woodford, a graduate of Millbank College of Commerce, joined KeyMed, a U.K. medical-equipment unit of Olympus, in 1981. He became Managing Director by the age of 30. In 2008 he became Executive Managing Director of Olympus Europa Holding GmbH and a member of the Olympus board of directors. In February 2011, he was appointed President of Olympus Corporation. On 30 September 2011 Woodford was appointed Chief Executive Officer, the appointment taking effect on 1 October. However, after he started agitating within the top Olympus executives about suspicious acquisitions, he was fired from his position as President and CEO on 14 October 2011; he remained a board director.\n\nKikukawa, Tsuyoshi \"Tom\" (菊川剛), born on 27 February 1941, was educated at Keio University, where he graduated in Political Science, Dept. of Law in March 1963. His management style is regarded as a 'Western', and is credited with having considerably changed the corporate culture of Olympus.\n\nKikukawa joined Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. (as Olympus Corporation was then known) in October 1964. In June 1993, he became Managing Director responsible for Public Relations & Advertising Dept. and DI Project and was made director and member of the main board. Kikukawa spent considerable time in the United States, where he foresaw the demand for the digital SLR. He is credited with the company's strategy in digital photography – he fought for commitment by Olympus to enter the market in high-resolution photographic products. As a result of his efforts, Olympus released an 810,000-pixel digital camera for the mass market in 1996, when the resolution of rivals' offerings was less than half. The very next year, Olympus hit the market with a 1.41 million pixel camera. By 2001, the company's annual turnover from digital photography was in excess of ¥100 billion. In recognition of the success in digital photography that he championed within the firm, Kikukawa was promoted to managing director in 1998 and president in April 2001.\n\nIn February 2011, Kikukawa handed the title of president to Michael Woodford, while remaining as board chairman and CEO. Kikukawa remained chairman when Woodford was promoted to CEO on 30 September 2011. Kikukawa re-assumed the titles of president and CEO two weeks later when Woodford was ousted. Kikukawa resigned as chairman, president, and CEO on 26 October 2011. Ahead of the much-awaited board meeting on 25 November, Kikukawa announced his resignation from the board. In 2013, he was sentenced to three years in prison, suspended for 5 years. The lenient sentence was because Kikukawa was not shown to have initiated or personally benefited from the scheme.\n\nTakayama, Shuichi Ph.D. (高山修一) became the chief executive officer and president of Olympus Corporation on the resignation of Tsuyoshi Kikukawa as a result of the Olympus scandal and occupied executive or directorate-level positions in other Olympus subsidiaries. He joined the Company in April 1970 and previously served as Director of Human Resources, Managing Executive Officer, Senior Managing Executive Officer and Manager of Life & Industrial System Company \nHe resigned all his positions and left the company at an extraordinary general meeting in April 2012 \n\nMori, Hisashi (森 久志) was Executive Vice President of Olympus Corporation until his resignation in November 2011. Mori joined Olympus in April 1981. He became General Manager, Finance Division since July 2001, and headed General Corporate Planning Office since April 2002; he was made General Manager of Corporate Planning Headquarters at Olympus Corporation in April 2005.\n\nMori served as a main board director of Olympus Corporation from June 2006 until his resignation in November 2011 due to the scandal. Mr. Mori served as a part-time director of ITX Corporation from June 2003 to June 2005, and was its full-time director since June 2007. In 2013, he was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison, suspended for 4 years.\n\nYamada, Hideo (山田秀雄) was Executive Managing Officer and Executive Officer of Olympus. He was a Standing Corporate Auditor of Olympus Corporation until November 2011. Yamada, who enjoyed observer status on the board, resigned. In 2013, he was sentenced to 3 years in prison, suspended for 5 years.\n\nSagawa, Hajime \"Jim\" (佐川 肇) is a graduate of Keio University.\n\nIn 1978, he met his future wife in Tokyo, where she was teaching English and met him when she went to a concert where his band was playing; at the time he worked at Nomura Research Institute. They married a year later, and moved to New York soon afterwards. Sagawa worked for four years at Nomura Securities International in the early 1980s; he was employed at Drexel Burnham Lambert, and later became head of mergers and acquisitions at Sanyo Securities America in the 1980s. Sagawa spent six years at Paine Webber from 1991 until he was laid off in 1996, when he cofounded his own brokerage firm, Axes America, in 1997 according to securities filings. SEC filings from 2002 through 2005 show his firm's revenue never exceeded $445,000, all paid by offshore entities owned by the members of Axes. In 2006 Axes signed its first contract with Olympus, and received fees of $3.2 million; fees in 2007 amounted to $7.7 million and $24.2 million in 2008, most of which was from Olympus. Finra records show that Sagawa became sole owner of the firm in 2007.\n\nSagawa and his wife divorced \"by mutual agreement\" in early November 2011. Through the divorce settlement, Sagawa received $1.5 million in assets, while his wife received $9.9 million, including the $2.5 million marital home in Boca Raton which was transferred to his wife for $10. After the scandal broke, he vacated a luxury mansion in the Cayman Islands, and his current address is unknown. He was neither indicted nor arrested.\n\nNakagawa, Akio (中川 昭夫) was head of equities at Paine Webber in Japan in the early 1990s. According to former colleagues, he worked in tandem with Hajime Sagawa, and performed \"portfolio reshuffling\" for his Japanese corporate clients, and had long-standing relationship with Olympus. A former Paine Webber banker attested that Nakagawa and Sagawa were handlers for Olympus, and they made use of Bermuda-based funds valued at \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to manage its balance sheet using Japanese accounting loopholes. Nakagawa and Sagawa were also colleagues at Drexel Burnham Lambert and PaineWebber. After Nakagawa left Wall Street firms in 1998, he once again joined with Hajime Sagawa, in Axes America. After the Olympus scandal broke, Nakagawa was traced by Reuters reporters to a \"luxury apartment block in Hong Kong\". He was neither indicted nor arrested.\n\nYokoo, Nobumasa (横尾 宣政) is a former investment banker with Nomura. He and some other Nomura executives were caught up in a racketeering scandal involving a corporate racketeer named Koiki Ryuichi, and was forced to resign in June 1998 after it the affair became public; some Nomura executives were arrested. Having founded Global Company in the late 1990s, Yokoo persuaded Olympus to invest ¥30 billion in their venture capital fund in 2000. He also introduced three small, unprofitable companies in which he was shareholder and executive. News Chef, a maker of microwave cookware, Altis and Humalabo were acquired by Olympus for ¥73.4 billion from Cayman Island-based funds between 2007 and 2010. According to its listing in Japan's corporate registry dated 28 July 2011, Nobumasa is president of Global Chef. He was neither indicted nor arrested.\n\nIn 2003, Yokoo Akinobu (横尾 昭信), Nobumasa's older brother, was chief financial officer of ITX, an information technology group Olympus acquired in 2003. Akinobu became a group executive officer after Olympus became majority owners. Akinobu was an Olympus executive officer between 2005 and 2009. He was never on the board.\n\nAkinobu is also president of Jalux, a company that provides parts and services to the aviation industry. He was neither indicted nor arrested.\n"}

She was the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics, the first being Marie Curie.\n\nA graduate of the University of Göttingen, Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctoral thesis on the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the laser permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon absorption cross section is named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.\n\nMaria Goeppert married Joseph Edward Mayer and moved to the United States, where he was an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University. Strict rules against nepotism prevented Johns Hopkins University from taking her on as a faculty member, but she was given a job as an assistant and published a landmark paper on double beta decay in 1935. In 1937, she moved to Columbia University, where she took an unpaid position. During World War II, she worked for the Manhattan Project at Columbia on isotope separation, and with Edward Teller at the Los Alamos Laboratory on the development of the Teller's \"Super\" bomb.\n\nAfter the war, Goeppert Mayer became a voluntary associate professor of Physics at the University of Chicago (where Teller and her husband worked) and a senior physicist at the nearby Argonne National Laboratory. She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with J. Hans D. Jensen and Eugene Wigner. In 1960, she was appointed full professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nMaria Göppert was born on June 28, 1906, in Kattowitz (now Katowice, Poland), a city in Prussia, the only child of and his wife Maria née Wolff. In 1910, she moved with her family to Göttingen when her father, a sixth-generation university professor, was appointed as the professor of pediatrics at the University of Göttingen. Goeppert was closer to her father than her mother. \"Well, my father was more interesting,\" she later explained. \"He was after all a scientist.\"\n\nGöppert was educated at the \"Höhere Technische\" in Göttingen, a school for middle-class girls who aspired to higher education. In 1921, she entered the \"Frauenstudium\", a private high school run by suffragettes that aimed to prepare girls for university. She took the \"abitur\", the university entrance examination, at age 17, a year early, with three or four girls from her school and thirty boys. All the girls passed, but only one of the boys did.\n\nIn the Spring of 1924, Göppert entered the University of Göttingen, where she studied mathematics. A purported shortage of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls led to an upsurge of women studying mathematics at a time of high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of mathematics at Göttingen, Emmy Noether, but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificates.\n\nInstead, Goeppert became interested in physics, and chose to pursue a Ph.D. In her 1930 doctoral thesis she worked out the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. Eugene Wigner later described the thesis as \"a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness\". At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the laser permitted the first experimental verification in 1961 when two-photon-excited fluorescence was detected in a europium-doped crystal. To honor her fundamental contribution to this area, the unit for the two-photon absorption cross section is named the \"GM\". One GM is 10 cm s photon. Her examiners were three Nobel prize winners: Max Born, James Franck and Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus (in 1954, 1925, and 1928, respectively).\n\nOn January 19, 1930, Goeppert married Joseph Edward Mayer, an American Rockefeller fellow who was one of James Franck's assistants. The two had met when Mayer had boarded with the Goeppert family. The couple moved to Mayer's home country of the United States, where he had been offered a position as associate professor of chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. They had two children, Maria Ann (who later married Donat Wentzel) and Peter Conrad.\n\nStrict rules against nepotism prevented Johns Hopkins University from hiring Goeppert Mayer as a faculty member. These rules, created at many universities to prevent patronage, had by this time lost their original purpose and were primarily used to prevent the employment of women married to faculty members. She was given a job as an assistant in the Physics Department working with German correspondence, for which she received a very small salary, a place to work and access to the facilities. She taught some courses, and published an important paper on double beta decay in 1935.\nThere was little interest in quantum mechanics at Johns Hopkins but Goeppert Mayer worked with Karl Herzfeld in this area. They collaborated on a number of papers, including a paper with Herzfeld's student A.L. Sklar on the spectrum of benzene. She also returned to Göttingen in the summers of 1931, 1932 and 1933 to work with her former examiner Born, writing an article with him for the \"Handbuch der Physik\". This ended when the NSDAP came to power in 1933, and many academics, including Born and Franck, lost their jobs. Goeppert Mayer and Herzfeld became involved in refugee relief efforts.\n\nJoe Mayer was fired in 1937. He attributed this to the hatred of women on the part of the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.\n\nIn December 1941, Goeppert Mayer took up her first paid professional position, teaching science part-time at Sarah Lawrence College. In the spring of 1942, with the United States embroiled in World War II, she joined the Manhattan Project. She accepted a part-time research post from Urey with Columbia University's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The objective of this project was to find a means of separating the fissile uranium-235 isotope in natural uranium; she researched the chemical and thermodynamic properties of uranium hexafluoride and investigated the possibility of separating isotopes by photochemical reactions. This method proved impractical at the time, but the development of lasers would later open the possibility of separation of isotopes by laser excitation.\n\nThrough her friend Edward Teller, Goeppert Mayer was given a position at Columbia with the Opacity Project, which researched the properties of matter and radiation at extremely high temperatures with an eye to the development of the Teller's \"Super\" bomb, the wartime program for the development of thermonuclear weapons. In February 1945, Joe was sent to the Pacific War, and Goeppert Mayer decided to leave her children in New York and join Teller's group at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Joe came back from the Pacific earlier than expected, and they returned to New York together in July 1945.\n\nIn February 1946, Joe became a professor in the Chemistry Department and the new Institute for Nuclear Studies at the University of Chicago, and Goeppert Mayer was able to become a voluntary associate professor of physics at the school. When Teller also accepted a position there, she was able to continue her Opacity work with him. When the nearby Argonne National Laboratory was founded on July 1, 1946, Goeppert Mayer was also offered a part-time job there as a senior physicist in the theoretical physics division. She responded \"I don't know anything about nuclear physics.\" She programmed the Aberdeen Proving Ground's ENIAC to solve criticality problems for a liquid metal cooled reactor using the Monte Carlo method.\n\nDuring her time at Chicago and Argonne in the late 1940s, Goeppert Mayer developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, which she published in 1950. Her model explained why certain numbers of nucleons in an atomic nucleus result in particularly stable configurations. These numbers are what Eugene Wigner called \"magic numbers\": 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. Enrico Fermi provided a critical insight by asking her: \"Is there any indication of spin orbit coupling?\" She realised that this was indeed the case, and postulated that the nucleus is a series of closed shells and pairs of neutrons and protons tend to couple together. She described the idea as follows:\nThree German scientists, Otto Haxel, J. Hans D. Jensen, and Hans Suess, were also working on solving the same problem, and arrived at the same conclusion independently. While their results were announced in an issue of the Physical Review before Goeppert Mayer in June 1949, Goeppert Mayer's work was received for review in February 1949, while the work of the German authors was received later in April 1949. Afterwards, she collaborated with them. Hans Jensen co-authored a book with Goeppert Mayer in 1950 titled \"Elementary Theory of Nuclear Shell Structure\". In 1963, Goeppert Mayer, Jensen, and Wigner shared the Nobel Prize for Physics \"for their discoveries concerning nuclear shell structure.\" She was the second female Nobel laureate in physics, after Marie Curie, and would be the last for over half a century, until Donna Strickland was awarded the prize in 2018.\n\nIn 1960, Goeppert Mayer was appointed full professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. Although she suffered from a stroke shortly after arriving there, she continued to teach and conduct research for a number of years. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. Goeppert Mayer died in San Diego, California, on February 20, 1972, after a heart attack that had struck her the previous year left her comatose. She was buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego.\n\nAfter her death, the Maria Goeppert Mayer Award was created by the American Physical Society to honor young female physicists at the beginning of their careers. Open to all female physicists who hold Ph.D.s, the winner receives money and the opportunity to give guest lectures about her research at four major institutions. Two of her former universities also honor her. The Argonne National Laboratory presents an award each year to an outstanding young woman scientist or engineer, while the University of California, San Diego hosts an annual Maria Goeppert Mayer symposium, bringing together female researchers to discuss current science. Crater Goeppert Mayer on Venus with a diameter of about 35 km is also named after Goeppert-Mayer. In 1996, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. In 2011, she was included in the third issuance of the \"American Scientists\" collection of US postage stamps, along with Melvin Calvin, Asa Gray, and Severo Ochoa. Her papers are in the Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego, and the university's physics department is housed in Mayer Hall, which is named after her and her husband.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was unusually small at birth and continued to grow slowly, although all contemporary sources and surviving portraits agree that his limbs and features were in proportion to his height (\"proportionate dwarfism\"). His fame spread, and in 1746 he was visited by ladies from the court of Stanisław, who was also the Duke of Lorraine and maintained a court at Lunéville, although he was no longer King of Poland. Stanisław sent his physician to examine the child, who was now five years old and approximately 24 inches (60 cm) tall, and subsequently sent for him. He offered Ferry's parents money in return for their son, who was to be maintained and educated in the Leszczyński household as the court dwarf.\n\nAt court Ferry quickly acquired the nickname Bébé (\"Baby\"). He was given to the queen as a birthday present in 1747, and, after her death in 1748, he became the property of her cousin, the Princesse de Talmont. He had tutors, but proved to be of relatively low intelligence and is reported never to have learned to read or write. A small wooden house was built for him in one of the halls of the Chateau de Lunéville, and he was spoiled and indulged by his master and the entire court. He played practical jokes on visitors and often behaved very badly, but he was the king's favourite and a great attraction. Those entertained by his antics included the Duc du Richelieu and Voltaire.\n\nIn 1759 the Polish dwarf Józef Boruwłaski visited the court. He was a witty, urbane young man of 20, shorter than Ferry and well versed in court manners. Unflattering comparisons were drawn, and Ferry became so angry that he attacked Boruwłaski and tried to throw him onto the fire. The indulgent Stanisław ordered Ferry beaten for this outrage, reportedly to his severe shock and mortification.\n\nFerry was also compared unfavourably with Boruwłaski by the aristocratic writer, scientist and physician Louis-Élisabeth de La Vergne de Tressan, who visited the Lunéville court to receive an honour from Stanisław. De Tressan later delivered a paper to the French Academy of Sciences likening Ferry to an animal in comparison with the intelligent, well-educated Polish dwarf.\n\nFerry remained at Stanisław's court throughout his life, eventually growing to a height of 34 inches (86 cm).\n\nFerry's health declined in his late teens. He developed a hunchback and had difficulty walking, and he suffered wasting of the soft tissues and signs of premature aging. Eventually he became incontinent and a chronic invalid, and died on 8 June 1764 aged 22. His skeleton was prepared and mounted for study, and is currently kept at the Musée de l'Homme in Paris. The rest of his remains were buried in the church at Lunéville; when the church was destroyed during the French Revolution, Ferry's inscribed mausoleum was preserved and is now at the Chateau de Lunéville. Some of Ferry's outfits are preserved in the historical museum at Nancy and there are a number of wax statues of him still in existence. A unique Luneville Faience statue of Ferry, 22 inches (56 cm) tall, modelled from life, was kept at the Chateau de Lunéville, but was destroyed in a fire in 2003.\n\nIn 2006 and 2008, French researchers published detailed studies of Ferry's skeletal remains, with particular attention to his jaws and facial bones. They concluded that Ferry suffered from a rare genetic form of primordial dwarfism characterised by small, abnormal teeth without roots, and dubbed the condition \"NMOSR\".\n\n"}

He played guitar with several Danish bands, and recorded an album in 1979 with a band called Rock Nalle & The Flames. He was also a member of Mercyful Fate for a brief time, before deciding to move to Los Angeles in pursuit of a career in music.\n\nL.A. Guns were first formed in 1983 by guitarist Tracii Guns and drummer Rob Gardner. The first lineup included Guns, Beich, Gardner and singer Michael Jagosz. The band recorded and EP \"Collector's Edition No. 1\". Shortly after, Jagosz left and was replaced by Bill Bailey (who would later change his name to Axl Rose) after Jagosz was arrested following a bar fight. Bailey had previously fronted Rapidfire with Kevin Lawrence and Hollywood Rose with Izzy Stradlin and Chris Weber.

{"id": "449063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449063", "title": "Robert Michels", "text": "Robert Michels\n\nRobert Michels (; 9 January 1876, Cologne, Germany – 3 May 1936, Rome, Italy) was a German-born Italian sociologist who contributed to elite theory by describing the political behavior of intellectual elites. He belonged to the Italian school of elitism. He is best known for his book \"Political Parties\", published in 1911, which contains a description of the \"iron law of oligarchy.\" He was a friend and disciple of Max Weber, Werner Sombart and Achille Loria. Politically, he moved from the Social Democratic Party of Germany to the Italian Socialist Party, adhering to the Italian revolutionary syndicalist wing and later to Italian Fascism, which he saw as a more democratic form of socialism. His ideas provided the basis of moderation theory which delineates the processes through which radical political groups are incorporated into the existing political system.\n\nMichels born to a wealthy German family, studied in England, Paris (at the Sorbonne), and at universities in Munich, Leipzig (1897), Halle (1898), and Turin. He became a Socialist while teaching at the University of Marburg and became active in the Social Democratic Party of Germany for whom he was an unsuccessful candidate in the German federal election, 1903. In Italy, he associated with , a leftist branch of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). He left both parties in 1907.\n\nHe achieved international recognition for his historical and sociological study, \"Zur Soziologie des Parteiwesens in der modernen Demokratie. Untersuchungen über die oligarchischen Tendenzen des Gruppenlebens\", which was published in 1911; its title in English is \"Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy\". In it, he presented his \"Iron law of oligarchy\" theory that political parties, including those considered socialist, cannot be democratic because they quickly transform themselves into bureaucratic oligarchies.\n\nMichels was considered a brilliant pupil of Max Weber, who began publishing his writings in the \"Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik\" in 1906 and appointed him as co-editor in 1913, but they disagreed over Michels' opposition to World War I.\n\nMichels criticized what he perceived to be Karl Marx's materialistic determinism. Michels borrowed from Werner Sombart's historical methods. Because Michels admired Italian culture and was prominent in the social sciences, he was brought to the attention of Luigi Einaudi and Achille Loria. They succeeded in procuring for Michels a professorship at the University of Turin, where he taught economics, political science and socioeconomics until 1914. He then became professor of economics at the University of Basel, Switzerland, a post he held until 1928.\n\nIn 1924 he joined the Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini, former director of the Italian Socialist Party's newspaper \"\"Avanti!\"\". Michels was convinced that the direct link between Benito Mussolini's charisma and the working class was in some way the best means to realize a real lower social class government without political bureaucratic mediation. In 1928, he became professor of economics and the history of doctrines at the University of Perugia and occasionally lectured in Rome where he died on May 3, 1936.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1152227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1152227", "title": "Sarah Silverman", "text": "Sarah Silverman\n\nSarah Kate Silverman (born December 1, 1970) is an American stand-up comedian, actress, producer, and writer. Her comedy addresses social taboos and controversial topics, such as racism, sexism, politics, and religion, sometimes having her comic character endorse them in a satirical or deadpan fashion. For her work on television, she has won two Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nSilverman was a writer and occasional performer on \"Saturday Night Live\", and starred in and produced \"The Sarah Silverman Program\", which ran from 2007 to 2010 on Comedy Central, for which she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. She released an autobiography \"The Bedwetter\" in 2010. She also appeared in other television programs, such as \"Mr. Show\" and \"VIP\", and starred in films, including \"Who's the Caboose?\" (1997), \"School of Rock\" (2003), \"Wreck-It Ralph\" (2012), and \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" (2014). In 2015, she starred in the drama \"I Smile Back\", for which she was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, she became increasingly politically active; she initially campaigned for Bernie Sanders, but later spoke in support of Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Since 2017, she has hosted the Hulu web television late-night talk show, \"I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman\".\n\nSilverman was born in Bedford, New Hampshire, to Beth Ann (née Halpin; 1941–2015) and Donald Silverman. She was raised in Manchester, New Hampshire. Beth had been George McGovern's personal campaign photographer and would found the theater company New Thalian Players, while Donald has training as a social worker and also ran the clothing store Crazy Sophie's Outlet. Silverman's parents divorced and later remarried others. Silverman is the youngest of five siblings. Her sisters are Reform rabbi Susan Silverman, screenwriter Jodyne Silverman, and actress Laura Silverman; her brother Jeffrey Michael died when he was three months old. Born into a Jewish family, she considers herself secular and non-religious. She was in attendance when women lit menorahs at the Western Wall for the first time, in December 2014. Her ancestors were from Poland and Russia.\nThe first time Silverman performed stand-up comedy was in Boston at age 17. She described her performance as \"awful\". After graduating from The Derryfield School in Manchester (Class of 1989), she attended New York University for a year but did not graduate. Instead, she performed stand-up comedy in Greenwich Village.\n\nAfter beginning her stand-up comedy in 1992, Silverman was part of the 1993–94 season of \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\") for 18 weeks as a writer and featured player. She was fired after one season where only one of the sketches she wrote survived to dress rehearsal and none aired, although she did appear on the show as a cast member in skits, usually in smaller supporting roles. Bob Odenkirk, a former \"SNL\" writer, explained, \"I could see how it wouldn't work at \"SNL\" because she's got her own voice, she's very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesn't disappear into the character—she makes the character her.\" She has stated that she was not ready for SNL when she got the job. She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so tough in her career. Later, she was grateful that her \"SNL\" time was short because it didn't end up defining her. She parodied the situation when she appeared on \"The Larry Sanders Show\" episode \"The New Writer\" (1996), playing Sanders' new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers. She appeared in three episodes of \"Larry Sanders\" during its final two seasons.\n\nShe also starred in the HBO sketch comedy series \"Mr. Show\" (1995–1997) and had the leading role for the 1997 independent film \"Who's the Caboose?\", about a pair of New York comedians (Silverman and director Sam Seder) going to Los Angeles during pilot season to try to get a part in a television series; the film features numerous young comedians in supporting roles but never received a widespread theatrical release. Silverman and Seder later made a six-episode television series sequel entitled \"Pilot Season\" in which Silverman stars as the same character and Seder again directed. She made her network standup comedy debut on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on July 3, 1997.\n\nSilverman made several TV program guest appearances, including on \"\" in the two-part time travel episode \"Future's End\" (1996); \"Seinfeld\" in the episode \"The Money\" (1997); \"VIP\" in the episode \"48 Hours\" (2002); \"Greg the Bunny\" as a series regular (2002); and on the puppet television comedy \"Crank Yankers\" as the voice of Hadassah Guberman (2003, 2007). She had small parts in the films \"There's Something About Mary\", \"Say It Isn't So\", \"School of Rock\", \"The Way of the Gun\", \"Overnight Delivery\", \"Screwed\", \"Heartbreakers\", \"Evolution\", \"School for Scoundrels,\" and \"Rent,\" playing a mixture of comic and serious roles.\n\nIn 2005, Silverman released a concert film, \"\", based on her one-woman show of the same name. Liam Lynch directed the film, which was distributed by Roadside Attractions. It received 64% positive ratings based on 84 reviews on the film critics aggregator Web site Rotten Tomatoes, and earned approximately $1.3 million at the box office. As part of the film's publicity campaign, she appeared online in \"Slate\" as the cover subject of \"Heeb\" magazine and in roasts on Comedy Central of Pamela Anderson and Hugh Hefner.\n\nSilverman played a therapist in a skit for a bonus DVD of the album \"Lullabies to Paralyze\" by the band Queens of the Stone Age. Silverman also appears at the end of the video for American glam metal band Steel Panther's \"Death To All But Metal.\" On \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", Silverman parodied sketches from \"Chappelle's Show\", replaying Dave Chappelle's characterizations of Rick James and \"Tyrone\" as well as a Donnell Rawlings character based on the miniseries \"Roots\". In 2006, Silverman placed 50th on \"Maxim\" Hot 100 List. In 2007, she placed 29th and appeared on the cover.\n\nHer television sitcom \"The Sarah Silverman Program\" debuted on Comedy Central in February 2007, the series had 1.81 million viewers and portrays the day-to-day adventures of fictionalized versions of Silverman, her sister Laura, and their friends. A number of comedic actors from \"Mr. Show\" have appeared on \"The Sarah Silverman Program\". Silverman was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for her acting on the show. At the awards ceremony, she wore a fake mustache. Comedy Central canceled \"The Sarah Silverman Program\" after three seasons.\n\nIn June 2007, she hosted the MTV Movie Awards. During her opening act, she commented on the upcoming jail sentence of Paris Hilton, who was in the audience, saying: \"In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like penises. I think it is wrong, too. I just worry she is going to break her teeth on those things.\" In September 2007, she appeared at the \"MTV Video Music Awards\". Following the comeback performance of Britney Spears, Silverman mocked her on stage, saying: \"Wow, she is amazing. I mean, she is 25 years old, and she has already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish in her life.\"\n\nIn January 2008, she appeared on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" to show Jimmy Kimmel, her boyfriend at the time, a special video. The video turned out to be a song called \"I'm Fucking Matt Damon\" in which she and Matt Damon sang a duet about having an affair behind Kimmel's back. The video created an \"instant YouTube sensation.\" She won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Music and Lyrics at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards. Kimmel responded with his own video a month later with Damon's friend Ben Affleck, which enlisted a panoply of stars to record Kimmel's song \"I'm Fucking Ben Affleck\". On September 13, 2008, Silverman won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for writing the song \"I'm Fucking Matt Damon\". Silverman guest-starred in a second-season episode of the USA cable program \"Monk\" as Marci Maven. She returned in the sixth-season premiere and for the 100th episode of \"Monk\". According to the audio commentary on the \"Clerks II\" DVD, director Kevin Smith offered her the role that eventually went to Rosario Dawson, but she turned it down out of fear of being typecast in \"girlfriend roles\". However, she told Smith the script was \"really funny\" and mentioned that if the role of Randal Graves was being offered to her she \"would do it in a heartbeat.\" She appeared in \"Strange Powers\", the 2009 documentary by Kerthy Fix and Gail O'Hara about cult songwriter Stephin Merritt and his band The Magnetic Fields. Silverman wrote a comic memoir, \"The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee\", which was published in 2010.\n\n Silverman played Geraldine alongside Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen in \"Take This Waltz\", written and directed by Sarah Polley. The film was well received when it premiered in Toronto in 2011 and was picked up by Magnolia for U.S. distribution in summer 2012. At the Toronto International Film Festival, she told the press she'd deliberately gained weight for the part, which required a nude scene, emphasizing that Polley wanted \"real bodies and real women.\" In interviews, she warned fans not to expect too much. However, she later told podcaster and author Julie Klausner that she had not really gained weight for the role and that the statements were meant as self-deprecating humor.\n\nOn September 20, 2012, Silverman made a public service announcement (PSA) criticizing new voter identification laws that create obstacles to the ability of certain groups to vote in the November presidential election, i.e., young, old, poor, and minority citizens. The project was financed by the Jewish Council for Education & Research (JCER) and was co-produced by Mik Moore and Ari Wallach (the pair that also co-produced The Great Schlep and Scissor Sheldon).\n\nSilverman voiced Vanellope von Schweetz, one of the main characters in the 2012 Disney animated film, \"Wreck-It Ralph\". She is in the creative team that writes and produces the content for the YouTube comedy channel called Jash. The other partners are Michael Cera, Reggie Watts, and Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim (also known as Tim & Eric). The JASH channel premiered online March 10, 2013. In Seth MacFarlane's western comedy film, \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\", she played Ruth, a prostitute, who is in love with Edward (Giovanni Ribisi). It was released on May 30, 2014.\n\nIn 2013, HBO announced that Silverman would star with Patti LuPone and Topher Grace in a situation comedy pilot called \"People in New Jersey\", produced by \"SNL\"s Lorne Michaels. The pilot was not picked up for a series order.\n\nSince 2017, she has hosted the Hulu web television late-night talk show, \"I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman\".\n\nIn a July 2001 interview on NBC's \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", Silverman used the ethnic slur \"chink\" in explaining that a friend advised her to avoid jury duty by writing a racial slur on the selection form, \"something inappropriate, like 'I hate chinks.'\" Silverman said she decided that she did not want to be thought of as a racist, so \"I wrote 'I love chinks' – and who doesn't?\"\n\nSilverman said the joke satirizes the racist thought process. Guy Aoki of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) objected to her use of the slur. NBC and O'Brien apologized, but Silverman did not. Later, appearing on \"Politically Incorrect\" in July and August 2001, Silverman questioned Aoki's sincerity, accusing him of exploiting the opportunity for publicity. On a later episode, Aoki appeared with Silverman and stated he did not accept Silverman's explanation, saying that it was not successful satire and that comedians should consult groups such as his before performing such material. She stated in an -->NPR \"Fresh Air\" interview that she was asked to repeat the joke on \"Politically Incorrect\", among other places, but eventually dropped it from her act because she felt it was becoming stale.\n\nSilverman has since turned the complaint into grist for her standup act, saying that the experience helped teach her the important lesson that racism is bad: \"And I mean \"bad\", like in that black way.\"\n\nA minor controversy arose over Silverman's performance in the documentary film \"The Aristocrats\" (2005). The film shows her doing the Aristocrats joke – a sample of transgressive art told by numerous comedians since the vaudeville era – like it was an autobiographical account of her life as a child sex performer. As part of the routine, she mentioned that Joe Franklin, a long-time New York radio and TV personality, would ask her to perform privately for him in his apartment, and as the punchline, deadpanned that \"Joe Franklin raped me.\"\n\nAfter the film's release, Franklin took offense at Silverman's using his name in the routine and considered suing her. A month later, \"The New York Times\" noted he remained undecided but had said, \"The best thing I could do is get Sarah better writers so she'd have funnier material.\"\n\nSilverman became a vegetarian at the age of ten. She is open about her lifelong battle with clinical depression, which at one point led to her developing an addiction to Xanax. She credited her subsequent emotional health to taking the prescription drug Zoloft. She struggled with bedwetting from the time she was young until well into her teens and stated in a 2007 interview that she had wet the bed recently.\n\nSilverman's autobiography, published in April 2010, entitled \"The Bedwetter\", explores the subject of bed wetting, among other subjects. She stated she did not want to get married until same-sex couples were able to. In 2014, she tweeted \"Just read that I wanna get married which is hilarious b/c I will never get married,\" adding, \"Why would I want the govt involved in my love life? Ew. It's barbaric.\"\n\nShe stated she does not want to have biological children because \"there's just millions of kids that have no parents\" in the world and to avoid the risk that they might inherit her depression. In 2017, Silverman also said that she has prioritized her artistic career, constantly on tour, instead of motherhood.\n\nSilverman's real-life sister, Laura, played her sister on \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\" An older sister, Susan, is a rabbi who lives in Jerusalem with her husband, Yosef Abramowitz, the co-founder and president of Arava Power Company, and their five children. Silverman considers herself culturally Jewish, which she has frequently mined for material, but says she is agnostic and does not follow Judaism, claiming, \"I have no religion. But culturally I can't escape it; I'm very Jewish.\"\n\nSilverman dated comedian and fellow \"SNL\" writer Dave Attell. Silverman began dating Jimmy Kimmel in 2002. She referred to the relationship in some of her comedy, joking: \"I'm Jewish, but I wear this Saint Christopher medal sometimes; my boyfriend is Catholic – but you know ... it was cute the way he gave it to me. He said if it doesn't burn a hole through my skin, it will protect me.\" In July 2008, \"Vanity Fair\" reported that the couple had split. However, in October 2008, the media reported they were on \"the road back to being together\". The couple attended the wedding of Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky, but split again in March 2009. At the Emmy Awards in August 2014, Silverman acknowledged she and Welsh actor Michael Sheen were in a relationship. Silverman said in February 2018 that the two had broken up over the holidays.\n\nIn July 2016, Silverman spent a week in the intensive care unit at Cedars Sinai Hospital with epiglottitis.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Howard Stern Show\" in October 2018, Silverman revealed that she was one of several female comedians who witnessed fellow comic Louis C.K. masturbate, which she said was a consensual act. Silverman stated she felt the act was not abusive, because of the absence of a power differential between the two.\n\nIn 2015, she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women, as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in Ethiopia, respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, she became increasingly politically active. In 2015, Silverman endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, saying, \"He says what he means & he means what he says & he's not for sale\". She had previously introduced Sanders at a rally in Los Angeles, California that drew an audience of over 27,500 people.\n\nThough she initially supported Sanders, she later spoke in support of Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In her convention speech, she urged other Sanders supporters to back Clinton and, later, amid some boos from some Sanders supporters, said, \"Can I just say?

{"id": "1194899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1194899", "title": "Tudor Vladimirescu", "text": "Tudor Vladimirescu\n\nTudor Vladimirescu (; c. 1780 – ) was a Romanian revolutionary hero, the leader of the Wallachian uprising of 1821 and of the Pandur militia. He is also known as Tudor din Vladimiri (\"Tudor of Vladimiri\") or — occasionally — as Domnul Tudor (\"Voivode Tudor\").\n\nTudor was born in Vladimiri, Gorj County (in the region of Oltenia) in a family of landed peasants (\"mazili\"); his birth year is usually given as 1780, but this is still debated. At the age of 12, he was sent to Craiova, in service to boyar Ioan Glogoveanu, where he would later learn rhetoric, grammar and the Greek language. He became administrator of the boyar's estate and, in 1806, was named \"vătaf\" (leader of the local militias) at Cloșani. Tudor's experience as a servant made him familiar with customs, habits and objectives of landowners; this insight helped him walk the fine line between conflicting interests of boyars and peasants in the first months of the uprising against the Phanariotes. While leader of a mainly peasant movement, Tudor did his best not to antagonize the elite, punishing any destruction of property.\n\nTudor enrolled in the Russian army and took part in the Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812. Consequently, he was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 3rd degree and given Russian protection and immunity from prosecution under both Wallachian and Ottoman legislation (\"see Sudiți\"). This contributed to Tudor's decisions throughout the uprising, alongside his belief that Russia was backing his actions. After the war, Tudor returned to Oltenia. He traveled briefly to Vienna, in 1814, in order to attend a lawsuit involving Glogoveanu's wife's patrimony. The trip coincided with the Peace Congress, and it is believed that Vladimirescu followed the treaties' outcome.\n\nBack in the country in 1815, Tudor learned that Ada Kaleh Ottoman garrison, who roamed Mehedinți and Gorj, had also destroyed his household from Cerneți.\n\nFrom 1812 to 1821, Vladimirescu slowly built a follower base. The Pandurs respected his military skills, and many sources point out his charisma and outstanding negotiating abilities. He would also have been familiarised with the outcomes of the First and Second Serbian Uprising.\n\nPrince Alexandros Soutzos' death in January 1821 led to the forming of a temporary \"Comitet de Ocârmuire\" (\"Governing Committee\"), three regents - all of them members of the most representative indigenous boyar families, of which the most prominent was \"Caimacam\" Grigore Brâncoveanu. The \"Comitet\", motivated against competition and denied Phanariote rulers' favours, decided to quickly manoeuver anti-boyar and anti-Phanariote sentiment in Wallachia (and especially in Oltenia), acting before the newly appointed Scarlat Callimachi could claim his throne. Therefore, an agreement between it and the Pandurs was reached on the 15th: Dimitrie Macedonski was awarded the post of lieutenant to Tudor.\n\nThe very same day, Vladimirescu sent a letter to the Ottoman Court of Mahmud II, stating that his objective was not the rejection of Ottoman rule, but that of the Phanariote regime, and showing his willingness for preservation of the traditional institutions. The statements were meant to buy Tudor time against Ottoman response, as he was already in negotiations with the Greek Anti-Ottoman revolutionary society Philikí Etaireía (having probably been in contact with it from around 1819). Together, they produced a plan for insurrection, with the two Etairist representatives (Giorgakis Olympios and Iannis Pharmakis) assuring the Wallachians of Russian support for the common cause. It is apparent that Tudor was not himself a member of the Etaireía: the rigid command structure of the Brotherhood would have excluded the need for any negotiations.\n\nAfter fortifying monasteries in Oltenia (Tismana, Strehaia) that were to serve him in the event of Ottoman intervention, Tudor travelled to Padeș where he issued his first proclamation (23 January). It included references to Enlightenment principles (notably, the right to resist oppression), but was also an almost millenarianist appeal to peasants, promising a \"spring\" to follow \"winter\".\n\nIn February the demands were detailed by more documents. They included: the elimination of purchased offices in the administration, with the introduction of meritocratic promotion, the suppression of certain taxes and taxing criteria, the reduction of the main tax, the founding of a Wallachian Army, and an end to internal custom duties. In line with these, Tudor asked for the banishment of some Phanariote families and forbidding future Princes to hold a retinue that would compete with local boyars for offices. Calls by boyars in the Divan for Tudor to cease such activities (expressed by envoy Nicolae Văcărescu) were met with a virulent refusal.\n\nThe army, swelled up in numbers as it advanced, occupied Bucharest on 21 March - here, Tudor issued another important proclamation, one that expressed yet again his commitment to peace with the Ottomans. Previously, the Philikí Etaireía under Alexander Ypsilanti had emerged in Moldavia, proclaiming a liberation from Ottoman rule that was backed by the then Moldavian Prince Michael Soutzos (\"see Greek War of Independence\"). However, this coincided with Russian reaction against Greek rebellion, with the Russian army entering Moldavia and enforcing \nHoly Alliance policies. Ypsilanti's army headed south, reaching Pandur-occupied Bucharest.\n\nTudor's actions in the meanwhile had destroyed his alliance to local boyars. He had started wearing the \"kalpak\" (a tall, cylindrical, black leather hat; \"see Ottoman Clothing\") reserved for the Prince, and demanded to be addressed as \"Domn\" (\"Master\", \"Prince\"; cf. \"Domnitor\") - moving away from subordination to the landowners' cause.\n\nThe meeting between Ypsilanti and Tudor brought a new compromise. Tudor considered himself liberated from the provisions of the January agreement, as Russia was now an enemy of the Etaireía; Ypsilanti tried to persuade him that Russian support was still possible. The country was divided into a Greek administration and a Wallachian one, with Tudor's declaring itself neutral in the face of large Ottoman armies preparing to cross the north of the Danube. Ottoman actions had been prompted by Russian threat of intervention in Wallachia.\n\nTudor's army retreated towards in Oltenia in May, as the Ottomans occupied Bucharest without meeting resistance. Tudor was no longer capable of maintaining the discipline and cohesion of his own troops, some of whom had resorted to robbery. In an attempt to ensure discipline, he imposed hangings of those found guilty. \nIn the meantime, Etaireía members, led by Alexander Ypsilantis developed a plot to remove Tudor. Following treason, Tudor was arrested in on 21 May. On the night of 27 to 28 May, following accusations of collaboration with the Ottomans against Etaireía, he was tortured and killed by Etaireía in Targoviste, his mutilated body being thrown into a cesspit. Tudor's collaboration with the Ottomans was never confirmed. The Etaireía did not succeed in its goal to assume command of Vladimirescu's army: most of it disbanded on the spot.\n\nTudor's rebellion ensured that Wallachia would stay under military occupation. Although the situation was stabilized by August, Ottoman troops remained present until 1826. However, as they could no longer trust Phanariote rule in the face of its infiltration by Greek nationalism (Ypsilanti himself came from a Phanariote family - \"see Alexander Ypsilanti, his grandfather, and Constantine Ypsilanti, his father\"), the Ottomans returned the two Principalities to rule by and through locals (in 1822): Grigore IV Ghica in Wallachia, Ioan Sturdza (Ioniţă Sandu Sturdza) in Moldavia. The changes in the situation were to be confirmed by the Treaty of Adrianople and Russian occupation (at the end of the Russo-Turkish War).\n\nAlthough the scope of his movement appealed to generations of Romanian nationalists, Tudor Vladimirescu's most favorable treatment came with the official ideology of the \"Romanian People's Republic\" (the first period of Communist Romania, lasting from 1948 to 1965). He was considered progressive, and it also contributed that he viewed himself as an ally to the Russian cause—almost as a precursor of the Soviet alliance. \nThe Romanian film \"Tudor\" (1962) narrated his life from the return home in 1812 to his death. Tudor, portrayed by Emanoil Petruţ, falls from his horse after being shot in the back, claiming to return \"as the grass of spring\" - a far easier death than what Vladimirescu had endured in reality. \n\nA division bearing his name (\"Divizia Tudor Vladimirescu\") was formed by the Red Army with Romanian prisoners of war who had fought on the Eastern Front. They were called on to fight the Ion Antonescu pro-Nazi Germany regime, and were absorbed into the Romanian Army after 1944. The division had its precedent in an artillery battery of the same name, grouping Romanian volunteers in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. An Order of Tudor Vladmirescu was also created.\n\n\n"}

After surviving the Holocaust, he emigrated to Israel.\n\nKristal was born to a religious Jewish family in Maleniec, Końskie County near Żarnów, then part of Congress Poland of the Russian Empire, on September 15, 1903. His father was a Torah scholar who ensured his son had a religious education, and Kristal would remain religiously observant all his life. He attended a \"cheder\" at age three, where he studied Judaism and Hebrew. He learned the Hebrew Bible at four and the Mishnah at six. In a 2012 interview, he recalled his father waking him at five in the morning to begin his religious instruction.\n\nHis mother died in 1910 when he was 7 years old. After World War I broke out in 1914, he saw Kaiser Franz Joseph in person when the monarch rode through his town in a car, and recalled them throwing sweets as he passed. His father was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army and died soon after. Meanwhile, Kristal moved in with his uncles.\n\nIn 1920, at age 17, he moved to Łódź. After briefly laboring as a metalworker, he opened a candy store with an uncle. While initially working as a physical laborer, he later became a renowned expert candy-maker. He married Chaja Feige Frucht in 1928, and had two children.\n\nIn 1940, after the Germans had taken over Poland during World War II, Kristal continued to manufacture candy, at times secretly and at other times with the encouragement of the heads of the ghetto, among them head of the Łódź Ghetto \"Judenrat\" Chaim Rumkowski. His two children died in the ghetto, while Kristal and his wife were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp during the liquidation of the ghetto in August 1944. \n\nKristal's wife died in Auschwitz while he worked as a forced laborer and survived. When the camp was liberated by the Red Army, Kristal weighed . He was taken to the hospital, where he returned to his profession and made candies for Soviet soldiers, before returning to Łódź, where he rebuilt his destroyed candy shop and met his second wife, Batsheva. They married in 1947. The couple had a son, Chaim, who was born in Poland, and a daughter, Shula, who was born in Israel.\n\nIn 1950, the family immigrated to Israel on the ship \"Komemiyut\" and settled in Haifa. He initially worked at the Palata candy factory, where he was considered an expert and taught the owners to make an entire production line of sweets. He then became self-employed, making boutique sweets at home and selling them at a Haifa kiosk. Among the sweets he produced were tiny liquor bottles made of chocolate wrapped in colored foil, jam made from carob, and chocolate-covered orange peels. In 1952, he began manufacturing his candies at the Sar and Kristal Factory on Shivat Zion Street. After the factory closed in 1970, he returned to making his candies at home before retiring.\n\nKristal had nine grandchildren. He also had great-grandchildren, but his family preferred not to state his exact number of descendants for fear of the \"evil eye\".\n\nHaving been unable to do so at the age of 13 due to World War I, Kristal celebrated his bar mitzvah a century later, in September 2016, at the age of 113. On August 11, 2017, Kristal died at his home in Haifa at the age of 113 years and 330 days.\n\nFollowing the death of Alice Herz-Sommer in London on February 23, 2014, Kristal became recognized as the world's oldest known Holocaust survivor (though he was actually older than she was). He became the world's oldest living man on January 18, 2016, after the death of Japanese supercentenarian Yasutaro Koide.\n\nOn March 11, 2016, Kristal was officially recognized as the world's oldest man by \"Guinness World Records\". His status was verified after documents confirming his age were uncovered in Poland (formerly, the family's oldest document was from his wedding at age 25, but Guinness regulations require documentation from the first 20 years of a person's life to claim the record; the newly found documents were discovered by Jewish Records Indexing – Poland).\n\n\n \n"}

A sequel documentary entitled \"In Bed with Yvette & Karl\" which aired on Living on 17 January 2009, charted Fielding's hysterectomy operation and recovery. A full-length series of \"In Bed with Yvette & Karl\", was then commissioned, and aired on Living during June and July 2009. In October 2009, a further documentary entitled \"Yvette & Karl: Life begins at 40\" was broadcast.

Their first production was \"Most Haunted\" for the British TV channel Living. In the show, viewers can see Fielding and paranormal experts investigating various supposedly haunted locations around Britain, in the hopes that paranormal activity may be documented by the crew. \"Most Haunted\" proved popular with audiences and remains to this day one of Living's highest-rated original shows. Leading on from this, in 2006 Fielding presented and produced \"Ghosthunting With...\", a paranormal show for ITV2 which shows Fielding leading various celebrities around haunted locations. These two shows established Yvette Fielding as British televisions 'first lady' of the paranormal, and somewhat of a cult figure.\n\nFielding has made many appearances and interviews in the British media in connection with her paranormal investigations and programmes, including guest appearances on \"The Sunday Night Project\" (Channel 4), \"The Chris Moyles Show\" (BBC Radio 1) and \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\" (BBC One).

However, seemingly contradicting this, in May 2011, Fielding appeared in an episode of the UK version of the \"Celebrity Ghost Stories\" series for the bio channel, with the entire UK series of \"Celebrity Ghost Stories\" being produced by Fielding's Antix Productions company. Then in September 2011 Fielding presented another episode of \"Ghosthunting with...\" featuring the cast of \"The Only Way Is Essex\". In April 2012, Fielding appeared in an episode of \"Olly: Life on Murs\", in which she and Olly Murs visited a haunted house.
