The screenplay was written by Roman Polanski, who was originally intended to be the director, although most of the direction was finally done by first-timer Simon Hesera.\n\nSet in a rundown Danish seaside resort, it depicts a day in the life of Bernie, a self-destructive alcoholic, as he takes Winnie, a young girl with a leg brace, to the resort despite constant rain. Though Winnie calls Bernie \"uncle,\" he is likely her biological father. Over the course of the day, they encounter various people whom Bernie alternately berates and scams for alcohol, while Winnie is often left alone to fend for herself.\n\nThe film was never released in theatres at the time of its completion, but has seen limited runs at film festivals since then. A small clip of the film appears in the documentary \"The Unknown Peter Sellers\".\n\nThe film is available on DVD in the U.S from Code Red DVD.\n"}

She founded and supported organisations promoting family welfare and other philanthropic causes.\n\nAlice Isabella Model née Sichel was born on 13 November 1856, the daughter of Henriette Goldschmidt and Gustavus Sichel, and grew up in a middle-class family that resided in Hampstead, London. Like a growing number of women of her time, Model expanded the acceptable horizons for women through her involvement in charitable activities. Married to Louis Model at twenty-four and childless, she devoted her life to social work and initiated many social services for women and children.\n\nShe sat on the Child and Maternity Committee for Stepney and represented Stepney in the London Federation of Infant Welfare Centres. In 1895 she founded the Sick Room Helps Society, which evolved into the Jewish Maternity Hospital in Underwood Street in 1911. The organisation aimed to help sick, poor and confined women within their homes in the East End. The organisation was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom, providing home helps and maternity nurses - one of the most important contributions to maternal healthcare. It provided a model for many state and private agencies which followed suit.\n\nAlma Cogan, Lionel Bart and Arnold Wesker were born in the Jewish Maternity Hospital. It closed its doors in 1939. Despite a campaign to try and save it, in 2012 the hospital was demolished by the Peabody Trust, who have used the land to build flats.\n\nModel was also a key player in the formation of a nursery on Shepherd Street in Spitalfields, which initially prioritised the children of widows, so they could work and would not be completely dependent on charity. The nursery is cited as eliminating illnesses rife in the East End by providing children with regular meals, places to wash and disinfecting their clothes. Daily visits from doctors also prevented illnesses reaching epidemic proportions. By 1911 annual attendance by children reached 11342. Lady Louisa Rothschild was president of the nursery. The nursery was renamed the Alice Model Nursery School to honour Model's 80th birthday. The Alice Model Nursery School still exists in Stepney today.\n\nModel recruited volunteers for good causes through the Union of Jewish Women and trained them to support poorer women who shared their religion. She always emphasised self-reliance and disapproved of charity that seemed to undermine individual responsibility.\n\nShe served on a London committee for dealing with the new National Health Insurance Act (1912), and on a committee administering the National Relief Fund in World War One where she was a Jewish Board of Guardians representative. In 1933, when she was already in her seventies, she joined the Jewish Refugees Committee and helped with refugees’ housing needs.\n\nOn her 70th birthday she was presented with an illuminated album inscribed with the names of 22 societies and 367 people who had been associated with her. She was appointed an MBE in the 1935 New Year’s Honours list. The following year, the Alice Model Nursery School was named in her honour. (See above.)\n"}

In October 1942 she was selected as one of the SS \"Aufseherin\" to be posted at the Majdanek camp near Lublin, Poland where she, and Hermine Braunsteiner, came to be regarded as two of the most brutal overseers. They regularly loaded trucks of women destined for the gas chambers. When a child was left over, the two would throw him or her on the top of the adults like luggage, and bolt the door shut. Orlowski often awaited the arrivals of new transports of women. She would then whip the prisoners, especially across the eyes. In Majdanek, Orlowski was promoted to the rank of \"Kommandoführerin\" (Work Detail Overseer) in the sorting sheds.\n\nAs the SS Aufseherin, Orlowski had over 100 women under her supervision, who sorted through stolen items from gassed prisoners: watches, furs, coats, gold, jewellery, money, toys, glasses, etc. When the camp was evacuated, the Germans sent Orlowski to the notorious Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp near Kraków, in Nazi-occupied Poland. In Plaszow-Kraków, Alice was in charge of a work detail on the Camp Street (Lager Strasse) and was known for her viciousness.\n\nIn early January 1945, Orlowski was one of the SS women posted on the death march to Auschwitz-Birkenau and it was during this time that her behaviour, previously noted as being brutal and sadistic, became more humane. On the death march in mid-January 1945 from Auschwitz to Loslau, Orlowski gave comfort to the inmates, and even slept alongside them on the ground outside. She also brought water to those who were thirsty. It is unknown why her attitude changed, but some speculate that she sensed the war was almost over and she would soon be tried as a war criminal. Orlowski eventually ended up back at Ravensbrück as a guard.\n\nAfter the war ended in May 1945, Orlowski was captured by Soviet forces and extradited to Poland to stand trial for war crimes. The \"picture book SS woman\" stood accused at the Auschwitz Trial in 1947. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released in 1957 after serving only 10 years. In 1975, West Germany tracked Orlowski down, and placed her on trial in the Third Majdanek Trial.\n\nShe died during the trial in 1976 at the age of 73.\n\n"}

Credited with the role of court vizier, it is a story occasionally recounted in middle-eastern lore, but perhaps more so in occult circles. The figure himself is largely unexpounded, as very few references to him are found in classical texts other than through subtle terms in Chapter 27 of the Qur'an. He is, however, apparent in a number of books that deal with Islamic occultism or \"Ruhaniyya\", and in one that appears to be attributed directly to him (titled, \"al-Ajnas\"). In like manner, through the ages he was eminently revered by the Quranic exegetical traditions where the powers he possessed were associated to the Ineffable Name of Allah.\n\nThe Qur'anic narrative is as follows:\nHe said, 'O Council, which one of you will bring me her throne, before they come to me in surrender?' \nAn Ifrit of the jinns said, 'I will bring it to thee, before thou risest from thy place; I have strength for it \nand I am trusty.' Said he who possessed knowledge of the Book, 'I will bring it to thee, before ever thy glance returns to thee.' Then, when he saw it settled before him, he said, 'This is of my Lord's bounty that He may try me, whether I am thankful or ungrateful. Whosoever gives thanks gives thanks only for his own soul's good, and whosoever is ungrateful -- my Lord is surely All-sufficient, All-generous.' \nHe said, 'Disguise her throne for her, and we shall behold whether she is guided or if she is of those that are not guided.' \nSo, when she came, it was said, 'Is thy throne like this?' She said, 'It seems the same.' 'And we were given the knowledge before her, and we were in surrender, \nIbn Kathir's dissertation in \"Tafsir ibn Kathir\":\n\n(One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: ) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This was Asif, the scribe of Sulayman.\" It was also narrated by Muhammad bin Ishaq from Yazid bin Ruman that he was Asif bin Barkhiya' and he was a truthful believer who knew the Greatest Name of Allah. Qatadah said: \"He was a believer among the humans, and his name was Asif.\" (I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!) Meaning, lift your gaze and look as far as you can, and before you get tired and blink, you will find it before you. Then he got up, performed ablution and prayed to Allah, may He be exalted. Mujahid said: \"He said, O Owner of majesty and honor.\" When Sulayman and his chiefs saw it before them...\n\nIn Kitab al-Kafi, Imam Hasan al-Askari narrates that the greatest name of Allah has seventy three letters and Asif only knew one. With that letter, the land between him and the throne of the Queen of Sheeba shrunk such that he was able to place the throne before Sulayman and the land returned to its original state before the blinking of an eye. He then further states that the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt know seventy two of the letters and the final letter is kept exclusively with Allah as knowledge of the ghaib. .\n"}

{"id": "9597431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9597431", "title": "Balinese name", "text": "Balinese name\n\nA Balinese name is part of a system of identification used by the Balinese people and in the western parts of the neighboring island of Lombok, Indonesia. A Balinese name will have three parts: a title, a birth order name and a personal name. Balinese people do not use a family name.\n\nBoth boys and girls receive birth order name from a small typical group of names for each birth order position. These names may vary due to caste, regional customs and variations in the Balinese language between the north and the south of the island. Balinese people use the birth order name to refer to one another.\n\nAs most Balinese are Hindus, many names will be of Sanskrit origin. Some people have traditional Balinese names. \n\nA birth order name is chosen from a few typical names according to the position of the child in the birth order of siblings. The people of Bali use the birth order name to refer to one another. \n\nThe first born are named \"Wayan\", \"Putu\", \"Gede\" or for a girl, \"Ni Luh\". \"Wayan\" is a Balinese name meaning \"eldest\".\n\nSecond born children are named \"Made\", \"Kadek\", or \"Nengah\". \"Made\" and \"Nengah\" mean \"madya\" or \"middle\". \"Kadek\" means \"little brother\" or \"little sister\".\n\nThe third born is given the name \"Nyoman\" or \"Komang\". These names may be shortened to \"Man\" and \"Mang\" respectively.\n\nFourth born children are named \"Ketut\". Ketut is often shortened to \"Tut\".\n\nIf there is a fifth child in the family, she is often called \"Wayan Balik\" (meaning \"Wayan again\").\n\nThe naming system allows a person to recognise another's caste. A person's caste, unlike in India, is relatively unimportant to the Balinese people. The idea of caste flowed into Balinese culture as close links with Hindu-Buddhist Java evolved. The inclusion of the caste may also have been due to Airlangga (991 1049), a half Balinese raja of the Kediri Kingdom.\n\nThe naming system of the peasant farmers of Bali may have preceded the idea of the caste. The farmers included indigenous Balinese and very early Hindu-Buddhist missionaries and their followers. The farmers represented a caste level that in India, would be called \"Sudra\". This \"farmer caste\" also used birth order names, perhaps to indicate inheritance.\n\nBeyond the birth order name, there are no special names to denote people from the Sudra caste. Those of the Sudra caste add an \"I\" (male) and \"Ni\" (female) in front of their names. For example, I Made Mangku Pastika, is the governor of Bali.\n\nThe Wesya is the trader and farmer caste. The Wesya once added \"Ngakan\", \"Kompyang\", \"Sang\", or \"Si\" before their name. However, most no longer do so due to assimilation into the Sudra. An example is Ngakan Gede Sugiarta Garjitha, a major general.\n\nThe Ksatria caste are the ruling and military elite in Hindu society. Some typical names of people of the Ksatria caste include: \"I Gusti Ngurah\" (male), \"I Gusti Ayu\" (female), \"Anak Agung\" (male), \"Anak Agung Ayu\" or \"Anak Agung Istri\" (female), \"Tjokorda\" which is sometimes abbreviated as \"Tjok\" (male), \"Tjokorda Istri\" (female), \"Ida I Dewa\", \"Dewa Agung\" or \"I Dewa\" (male), and \"I Dewa Ayu\", and \"Desak\" (female).\n\nThe name \"Gusti\" literally means \"leader\" as members of the Ksatria were often families promoted from the farmer caste. The Ksatria often use birth order names. Sometimes the Kastria borrow the whole order of the farmer caste names, so it is possible to find a name like \"I Gusti Ketut Rajendra\", indicating a male of the Wesya caste, fourth born, whose personal name is \"Rajendra\".\n\nThe word \"Agung\" means \"great\", or \"prominent\". The word \"Tjokorda\" is a conjunction of the Sanskrit words \"Tjoka\" and \"Dewa\". It literally means \"the foot of the Gods\", and is awarded to the highest members of the aristocracy. \n\nAnother typical name might be \"Anak Agung Rai\", meaning a Ksatria, whose personal name means \"the great one\". It is more difficult to differentiate sexes by name alone among the Ksatria people, though personal names often tell, like \"Putra\", or \"prince\", for a boy, and \"Putri\", or \"princess\", for a girl.\n\nAn example is Sri Aji Kresna Kepakisan (reign 1352 CE 1380 CE}}. Other examples are I Gusti Ngurah Rai, military commander and national hero, Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung, former Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati, president of the State of East Indonesia, Dewa Made Beratha, a former Governor of Bali.\n\nThe Brahmin caste are academics, intellectuals, economists, aristocrats and lawyers. Names for the Brahmana caste include \"Ida Bagus\" (male), \"Ida Ayu\" (female). A typical name might be \"Ida Ayu Ngurah\", meaning \"Brahman woman, Beautiful highness whose personal name is Ngurah,\" (in English, \"gift from heaven\"). Other examples are Ida Ayu Oka Rusmini, novelist and Ida Bagus Oka, a former governor of Bali.\n\nInter-caste marriages occur. Those who marry someone from a higher caste will adopt the name \"Jero\" (\"come in\") in front of their name.\n\nA name may have a prefix to indicate gender, \"I\" for males and \"Ni\" for females. Typical names are. for example, \"I Wayan Pedjeng\" (first-born male whose personal name is \"moon\") or \"Ni Ketut Sulastri\" (fourth-born female whose personal name is \"fine light\"). Unlike Javanese names, Balinese names of Sanskrit origin do not experience vowel change from \"a\" to \"o\" (as in Javanese \"Susilo\", from \"Susila\").\n\n"}

William \"Little Bill\" Standifer (1853 - October 4, 1903) was an American gunman and lawman of the Old West. He is best remembered for having been killed by noted and better known gunman John Higgins in 1903.\n\nStandifer was born J. William \"Bill\" Standifer in Burnet County, Texas, and raised in Lampasas County, Texas, working cattle. By the age of 14, he was working regularly as a cowboy. That year, when he came across four men rustling cattle, he was pistol whipped by the men and badly hurt, but survived. Despite his youth, he tracked all four men, and killed them one by one. Although charges were pursued, he was acquitted. \n\nIn April 1879, Standifer was working as a cowboy on the \"Ike Mullins Ranch\", in Tom Green County, Texas, where he came into contact with another cowboy, John McMahon, sometimes called John Mahon. The two found themselves involved in an argument when Standifer refused to allow McMahon to drive cattle across a pasture where Standifer was holding several head of Mullin's cattle. McMahon produced a bullwhip, while a companion pointed a rifle at Standifer, then McMahon began whipping Standifer. Both men were mounted, and Standifer was able to ride away to escape. Days later, Standifer tracked McMahon to a cattle camp near Pony Creek, located in Coleman County. As Standifer rode up, McMahon was mounted talking with several other cowboys. Upon seeing Standifer, McMahon drew his pistol and fired, but missed. Standifer drew and fired also, hitting McMahon in the wrist, causing his pistol to fall from his grip. McMahon spun his horse and galloped away, with Standifer in pursuit. The two made it about 600 yards from where the shootout began, with Standifer shooting McMahon again in the back, knocking him from his saddle. McMahon scrambled to his feet and attempted to run, but was again shot in the back, killing him. \n\nStandifer fled, making it to Marfa, Texas, where he became involved in a saloon argument with three soldiers from Fort Davis, during which he shot and wounded two of them, before fleeing. Members of the Texas Rangers hunted Standifer down for the McMahon killing, and arrested him. However he was acquitted in a trial. Those shootings led to Standifer becoming known as a \"gunman\", and helped him in gaining employment as a Range Detective.\n\nBy the early 1880s, Standifer was working as a Range Detective, tracking down rustlers, and is known to have shot and killed at least one rustler near Estacado, Texas. When the demand for his services dwindled, Standifer ran and was elected as County Sheriff for Crosby County, Texas from 1888 through 1894. While serving as Sheriff, in 1891, he and Deputy Charlie Quillen pursued a group of Post Office thieves into Lincoln County, New Mexico, where they captured them. \n\nOn the return trip to Texas, while staying over at the \"VVN Ranch\" owned by George Neal, the outlaws attempted to overpower him and Deputy Quillen. The deputy was shot and wounded in the chest with his own rifle, but was able to wrestle the outlaw to the floor and overpower him. The shot had also wounded George Neal's wife. Standifer, who was outside tending the horses, heard the wife scream, and ran inside. Another of the outlaws had acquired Standifer's shotgun, but when Standifer entered, the shotgun misfired. Standifer beat the suspect into submission, then assisted Deputy Quillen. That same night he shackled all three outlaws, and rode with them and Quillen to the nearest doctor. Deputy Quillen survived, and the two were later able to take their prisoners on to Texas. \n\nIn 1893 he began working again as a Range Detective for large and prosperous ranches in the Texas Panhandle, mainly the powerful \"Spur Ranch\", located in Spur, Texas, where he first met John \"Pink\" Higgins, a notable gunman already known to Standifer, since they were both from Lampasas, Texas. Standifer quickly gained a reputation for being an excellent tracker, and for always locating his prey. In June 1898, while tracking rustlers, Standifer arrived in Clairemont, Texas, a rough town at the time, and the location in which Jeff Hardin, brother to gunman John Wesley Hardin, had been shot and killed. Standifer located a rustler named Bob Kiggins there, but Kiggins refused to surrender, and in the gunfight that followed Standifer shot and killed Kiggins. \n\nDuring this period, an animosity between Standifer and Higgins developed, one that has never truly been explained. It has been written that the Horrell Brothers, who were brought down mostly through the efforts of \"Pink\" Higgins, and who were distant kin to Standifer, was part of their problems. However, it is more likely that it was due to Higgins' son, Cullin, an attorney, who had only recently represented Standifer's wife in her divorce from Standifer. Fred Horsbrugh, manager of the \"Spur Ranch\", fired both Higgins and Standifer due to the increasing hostilities between them. However, Horsbrugh allowed Higgins to stay on for a time after this, until he could find another job. This angered Standifer. In 1900, Standifer moved to Hartley County, Texas, where he was elected Sheriff. \n\nAt one point, just prior to Higgins leaving the \"Spur Ranch\", he was dispatched to investigate a possible cattle rustling on a remote section of the ranch. Making a circular approach, Higgins spotted Standifer waiting in a group of trees. Rather than approach him, and knowing he was there to ambush him, Higgins simply went home. However, the animosity continued. On the morning of October 4, 1903, after having made comments that he would kill Higgins, Standifer rode out to Higgins' ranch. Higgins, seeing him from his house, rode out to meet him. Higgins' brother-in-law and daughter were standing on a hillside nearby, and witnessed what happened next. Standifer fired first, hitting Higgins' horse, which then jerked, causing Higgins first shot to go wild. In the shooting exchange that followed, Standifer was shot and killed. Higgins' horse also died. \n\nHiggins then retrieved another horse, and contacted Sheriff B. F. Roy, in Clairemont. When Higgins told Sheriff Roy that he believed he had killed Standifer, Sheriff Roy, who disliked Standifer for reasons unknown, stated \"Well if you're not sure, you'd better go and finish the job\". The shooting was ruled justifiable homicide, and Higgins was never arrested or tried. He buried Standifer himself, on the Higgins property, naming the thicket where he is buried \"Standifer's Thicket\".\n\n"}

She is the Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School, where she has been tenured since 1990, and the James Barr Ames Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. From 2008 to 2012 she was the special gender adviser to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.\n\nAs an expert on international law, constitutional law, political and legal theory, and jurisprudence, MacKinnon focuses on women's rights and sexual abuse and exploitation, including sexual harassment, rape, prostitution, sex trafficking and pornography. She was among the first to argue that pornography is a civil rights violation, and that sexual harassment in education and employment constitutes sex discrimination.\n\nMacKinnon is the author of over a dozen books, including \"Sexual Harassment of Working Women\" (1979); \"Feminism Unmodified\" (1987), described as \"one of the most widely cited books on law in the English language\"; \"Toward a Feminist Theory of the State\" (1989); \"Only Words\" (1993); a casebook, \"Sex Equality\" (2001 and 2007); \"Women's Lives, Men's Laws\" (2005); and \"Butterfly Politics\" (2017).\n\nMacKinnon was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the first of three children (a girl and two boys) to Elizabeth Valentine Davis and George E. MacKinnon; her father was a lawyer, congressman (1947–1949), and judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (1969–1995).\n\nMacKinnon became the third generation of her family to attend her mother's alma mater, Smith College, graduating in the top two percent of her class. She obtained her J.D. from Yale University in 1977 and a PhD in political science, also from Yale, in 1987. While at Yale, she received a National Science Foundation fellowship.\n\nMacKinnon is the Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School and the James Barr Ames Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 2007, she served as the Roscoe Pound Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and has also visited at NYU, University of Western Australia, University of San Diego, Hebrew University, Columbia Law School, University of Chicago, University of Basel, Yale Law School, Osgood Hall Law School, UCLA School of Law, and Stanford Law School.\n\nMacKinnon is a highly cited legal scholar, and regular public speaker. Her ideas can be divided into three overlapping areas: sexual harassment, pornography and prostitution, and international work. She has also written extensively on social and political theory and methodology.\n\nAccording to an article in 2006 by Deborah Dinner in \"Legal Affairs\", MacKinnon first focused on what became known as sexual harassment after learning about an administrative assistant at Cornell University who had resigned after being hospitalized because of it. The woman had refused a transfer when she complained about her supervisor's behavior, then was denied unemployment benefits because she quit for what were termed \"personal\" reasons.\n\nIn 1977 MacKinnon graduated from Yale Law School having written a paper on sexual harassment for Professor Thomas I. Emerson arguing that it was a form of sex-based discrimination. Two years later, Yale University Press published MacKinnon's book, \"Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination\" (1979), creating the legal claim for sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and any other sex-discrimination prohibition. While working on the paper and book, she shared draft copies with legal authorities who embraced her approach. She also conceived the legal claim for sexual harassment as sex discrimination in education under Title IX, which was established through litigation brought by Yale undergraduates in \"Alexander v. Yale.\" While the plaintiff who went to trial on the facts, Pamela Price, lost, the case established the law: the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recognized that, under the civil rights statute Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, schools must have procedures to address sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination.\n\nIn her book, MacKinnon argued that sexual harassment is sex discrimination because the act is a product of, and produces, the social inequality of women to men (see, for example, pp. 116–18, 174). She distinguishes between two types of sexual harassment (see pp. 32–42): 1) \"quid pro quo\", meaning sexual harassment \"in which sexual compliance is exchanged, or proposed to be exchanged, for an employment opportunity (p. 32)\" and 2) the type of harassment that \"arises when sexual harassment is a persistent condition of work (p. 32)\". In 1980, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission followed MacKinnon's framework in adopting guidelines prohibiting sexual harassment by prohibiting both quid pro quo harassment and hostile work environment harassment (see 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11 (a)). Courts also used the concepts.\n\nIn 1986 the Supreme Court held in \"Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson\" that sexual harassment may violate laws against sex discrimination. MacKinnon was co-counsel for Mechelle Vinson, the plaintiff, and wrote the brief in the Supreme Court. In \"Meritor\", the Court recognized the distinction between quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile workplace harassment. In a 2002 article, MacKinnon wrote, quoting the Court:\n\n\"Without question,\" then-Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court, \"when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor \"discriminate[s]\" on the basis of sex.\" The D.C. Circuit, and women, had won. A new common law rule was established.\n\nMacKinnon's book, \"Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination\", is the eighth most-cited American legal book published since 1978, according to a study published by Fred R. Shapiro in January 2000.\n\nMacKinnon, along with late feminist activist Andrea Dworkin, tried to change legal approaches to pornography by framing it as a civil rights violation in the form of sex discrimination, and as human trafficking. They defined pornography as:\n\nIn \"Toward a Feminist Theory of the State\", MacKinnon writes, \"Pornography, in the feminist view, is a form of forced sex, a practice of sexual politics, and institution of gender inequality.\" As documented by extensive empirical studies, she writes, \"Pornography contributes causally to attitudes and behaviors of violence and discrimination which define the treatment and status of half the population.\"\n\nIn 1980, Linda Boreman (who had appeared, under the name Linda Lovelace in the pornographic film \"Deep Throat\") claimed her ex-husband Chuck Traynor had violently coerced her into making Deep Throat and other pornographic films. Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, together with MacKinnon, members of Women Against Pornography, and feminist writer Andrea Dworkin offering statements in support. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, Boreman, and Gloria Steinem began discussing the possibility of using federal civil rights law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of \"Deep Throat\". This was not possible for Boreman because the statute of limitations for a possible suit had passed.\n\nMacKinnon and Dworkin continued to discuss civil rights litigation, specifically sex discrimination, as a possible approach to combating pornography. MacKinnon opposed traditional arguments and laws against pornography based on the idea of morality or filth or sexual innocence, including the use of traditional criminal obscenity law to suppress pornography. Instead of condemning pornography for violating \"community standards\" of sexual decency or modesty, they characterized pornography as a form of sex discrimination and sought to give women the right to seek damages under civil rights law when they could prove they had been harmed. Their anti-pornography ordinances make actionable only sexually explicit material that can be proven to subordinate on the basis of sex.\n\nIn 1983, the Minneapolis city government hired MacKinnon and Dworkin to draft an anti-pornography civil rights ordinance as an amendment to the Minneapolis city human rights ordinance. The amendment defined pornography as a civil rights violation against women and allowed women who claimed harm from trafficking in pornography to sue the producers and distributors for damages in civil court. It also allowed those who had been coerced into pornography, had had pornography forced upon them, or were assaulted in a way caused by specific pornography to sue for harm they could prove. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council but was vetoed by the mayor. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was ruled unconstitutional by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, a decision summarily affirmed (without opinion) by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMacKinnon wrote in the \"Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review\" in 1985\n\nAnd as you think about the assumption of consent that follows women into pornography, look closely some time for the skinned knees, the bruises, the welts from the whippings, the scratches, the gashes. Many of them are not simulated. One relatively soft core pornography model said, \"I knew the pose was right when it hurt.\" It certainly seems important to the audiences that the events in the pornography be real. For this reason, pornography becomes a motive for murder, as in \"snuff\" films in which someone is tortured to death to make a sex film. They exist.\"\n\nMacKinnon represented Boreman from 1980 until Boreman's death in 2002. Civil libertarians frequently find MacKinnon's theories objectionable (see \"Criticisms\" section), arguing there is no evidence that sexually explicit media encourages or promotes violence against, or other measurable harm of women. Max Waltman states that the empirical evidence for this view is emphatic.\n\nIn February 1992 the Supreme Court of Canada largely accepted MacKinnon's theories of equality, hate propaganda, and pornography, citing extensively from a brief she co-authored in a ruling against Manitoba pornography distributor Donald Butler. The \"Butler\" decision was controversial to some; it is sometimes implied that shipments of Dworkin's book \"\" were seized by Canadian customs agents under this ruling, as well as books by Marguerite Duras and David Leavitt. In fact, MacKinnon's brief argued that seizure of materials for which no harm was shown was unconstitutional.\n\nSuccessful \"Butler\" prosecutions have been undertaken against the lesbian sadomasochistic magazine \"Bad Attitude\", as well as the owners of a gay and lesbian bookstore for selling it. Canadian authorities raided an art gallery and confiscated controversial paintings depicting child abuse. Many free speech and gay rights activists have alleged that the law is selectively enforced, targeting the LGBT community.\n\nMacKinnon represented Bosnian and Croatian women against Serbs accused of genocide since 1992, creating the legal claim for rape as an act of genocide in that conflict. She was co-counsel, representing named plaintiff S. Kadic, in \"Kadic v. Karadzic\" and won a jury verdict of $745 million in New York City on August 10, 2000. The lawsuit (under the United States' Alien Tort Statute) established forced prostitution and forced impregnation when based on ethnicity or religion in a genocidal context as legally actionable acts of genocide. In 2001, MacKinnon was named co-director of the Lawyers Alliance for Women (LAW) Project, an initiative of Equality Now, an international non-governmental organization.\n\nMacKinnon proposed the law against prostitution in Sweden in 1990, which Sweden passed in 1999. What became termed the Swedish Model, also known as the Nordic Model or the Equality Model, penalizes buyers of persons for sexual use as well as sellers, namely pimps or sex traffickers, while decriminalizing all those who are bought and sold in prostitution. The fundamental concept is that the requirement to exchange sexual use for survival is a product of sex inequality and a form of violence against women. This model, shown to have reduced prostitution and sex trafficking dramatically, has been accepted in Norway, Iceland, Canada, Ireland, Northern Ireland, and France. MacKinnon works actively with the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) and Apne Aap in India.\n\nMacKinnon argues that the inequality between women and men in most societies form a hierarchy that institutionalizes male dominance, subordinating women, in an arrangement rationalized and often perceived as natural. She writes about the interrelations between theory and practice, recognizing that women's experiences have, for the most part, been ignored in both arenas. Furthermore, she uses Marxism to critique certain points in liberal feminism in feminist theory and uses radical feminism to criticize Marxist theory. MacKinnon notes Marx's criticism of theory that treated class division as a spontaneous event that occurred naturally. She understands epistemology as theories of knowing, and politics as theories of power: \"Having power means, among other things, that when someone says, 'this is how it is', it is taken as being that way. ... Powerlessness means that when you say 'this is how it is,' it is not taken as being that way. This makes articulating silence, perceiving the presence of absence, believing those who have been socially stripped of credibility, critically contextualizing what passes for simple fact, necessary to the epistemology of a politics of the powerless.\"\n\nIn 1996 Fred R. Shapiro calculated that \"Feminism, Marxism, Method, and the State: Toward Feminist Jurisprudence\", 8 Signs 635 (1983), was the 96th most cited article in law reviews even though it was published in a non-legal journal.\n\nDuring the \"Feminist Sex Wars\" in the 1980s, feminists opposing anti-pornography stances, such as Carole Vance and the late Ellen Willis, began referring to themselves as \"pro-sex\" or \"sex-positive feminists\". Sex positive feminists and anti-pornography feminists have debated over the implicit and explicit meanings of these labels. Sex-positive feminists note that anti-pornography ordinances contrived by MacKinnon and Dworkin called for the removal, censorship, or control over sexually explicit material.\n\nIn \"States of Injury\" (1995), Wendy Brown contends that MacKinnon's attempt to ban prostitution and pornography does not primarily protect but reinscribes the category of \"woman\" as an essentialized identity premised on injury. In \"The Nation\", Brown also characterized MacKinnon's \"Toward a Feminist Theory of the State\" (1989) as a \"profoundly static world view and undemocratic, perhaps even anti-democratic, political sensibility\" as well as \"flatly dated\" and \"developed at 'the dawn of feminism's second wave ... framed by a political-intellectual context that no longer exists—a male Marxist monopoly on radical social discourse'\".\n\nMacKinnon formerly had a relationship with author and animal-rights activist Jeffrey Masson.\n\nBooks\n\nOp-eds\n\nCourt cases\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34820746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34820746", "title": "Danilo Restivo", "text": "Danilo Restivo\n\nDanilo Restivo (born 3 April 1972) is an Italian man serving a life sentence with a 40-year tariff in Britain for the 12 November 2002 murder of Heather Barnett in Bournemouth, England. Investigators suspected Restivo had murdered Barnett because of his involvement in the 12 September 1993 disappearance of Elisa Claps in Potenza, but they were unable to charge him because of lack of evidence. Subsequent to the 2010 discovery of Claps's body, Restivo was tried for the murder of Barnett, with evidence of similarities in ritualistic placing of hair on the bodies of Claps and Barnett being heard by the English court. He was found guilty of murdering Barnett, and later convicted \"in absentia\" of the murder of Claps by an Italian court.\n\nRestivo was born in Sicily. In 1972 he was living with his parents and his elder sister in the city of Potenza, in Southern Italy. \nHe would attempt to arrange dates with girls by claiming to have a present for them. Restivo harassed those who rejected him with phone calls in which he would play a soundtrack to \"Profondo Rosso\" (English title: \"Deep Red\"), a \"giallo\" film about a serial killer who plays a melody before every murder. Claps, the 16-year-old daughter of a tobacconist and a clerk, was an honor student and a devoted Catholic, with ambitions to become a physician and work with Médecins Sans Frontières. She was the youngest of three children and was described as very close to her family. Friends reported Claps felt sorry for Restivo, who appeared lonely and depressed. She wrote several pages in her secret diary complaining about his odd behaviour. Despite misgivings, she agreed to meet Restivo at the 15th-century Chiesa della Santissima Trinità in the centre of the city, after Restivo phoned and asked for a date, pretending he had a love match with a friend of hers and asking for suggestions.\n\nOn Sunday 12 September 1993, Claps, accompanied by a female friend, went to meet Restivo at the church, arriving at approximately 11:30 a.m., just as mass had ended. When she did not return home, Claps' elder brother, Gildo, telephoned Restivo's family residence and was told that Restivo was out of town due to university essays and had no knowledge of Claps's whereabouts. When Gildo went to the church, he discovered the priest in charge, Domenico Sabia, had suddenly left for some days, taking with him the only key giving access to the upper story of the church building. Gildo reported the disappearance of his sister to police, but was initially told the matter had \"no urgency\" and policemen suggested Elisa could have run away with her boyfriend or something similar. When a policeman questioned him, Restivo fell into a near-hysterical state, then admitted that he and Claps had spent some time together discussing the girl he had fallen in love with. Claps had then left the church, while he had stayed to pray. He added that Claps had seemed frightened and had confided to him that she \"had been harassed by a boy before entering the church\". Restivo explained a severe cut on his hand as the result of an accident. Later that day, he said, he had gone to Naples, where he was a freshman at the Faculty of Dentistry. The Restivo family declined the policeman's request for clothes Restivo had worn on that Sunday morning. Moreover, the fiancé of Restivo's sister, a young man named Giovanni M., told the police that Restivo had looked terrified about that little cut on his hand and had insisted on being accompanied to the emergency room. Giovanni M. stated that Restivo's jacket looked very dirty and soaked with blood. Sabia opposed a search of the church. Restivo was known to police, who believed him be responsible for nine incidents in which women had had their hair clandestinely cut. He was also thought to have tied up two children before cutting one with a knife. A magistrate refused to issue an arrest warrant for Restivo in June 1994, but four months later he was taken into custody. An Italian policeman who questioned Restivo described him as \"cunning\" and \"precise in his answers\".\n\nClaps' disappearance was the subject of intense media interest and speculation.\nTobias Jones writes, \"The case gradually became, for many, an obsession, one of the iconic Italian mysteries that enabled people to engage in \"dietrologia\", literally 'behindery' or conspiracy-theorising. Claps' face—her long, dark hair, thick glasses and carefree smile—haunted the nation.\" An acquaintance of Claps said that she had been abducted by criminals. Claps' diary had a page missing; tests suggested that there were words written in Albanian. A connection to Albania was thought by some to be the most promising line of inquiry. Claps' elder brother, Gildo, alleged that the investigation into his sister's disappearance had been hindered by deference to prominent community figures. The investigation was taken away from the Potenza authorities and moved 120 km away to Salerno.\n\nClaps' close friend who had accompanied her on the day of her disappearance told investigators that she had last seen Claps outside the church at 11:30 a.m., at which point Claps had departed to meet Restivo in the church. She claimed Claps had told her she would be back in half an hour. Prosecutors accused her of lying and suspected her of involvement in the disappearance; they asserted that she had been seen with Claps later in the day. The young woman, aged only 16, later confessed to several friends that she was worried and that she could have met the same destiny of Claps if she had been with her.\n\nThe assumption that Claps had subsequently left the church moved the focus of the investigation away from the church building and onto other lines of inquiry; the church was not thoroughly searched.\n\nIn Italy, the accused is presumed innocent, and both the defendant and the prosecution can appeal a court's judgment. An appeal triggers what is essentially a \"trial de novo\", in which all evidence and witnesses can be re-examined. A further appeal can be made to the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation (\"Corte di Cassazione\"), but only on procedural grounds or on issues of the interpretation of law.\n\nIn 1996, Restivo was tried for giving false information. He testified that he had met Claps in a curtained area behind the altar before she left minutes later. He admitted he had previously taken girls to a room on the first floor of the church. In 2010, the remains of Claps were found yards from that location. Tried along with Restivo were an Albanian man and Claps' close friend. Restivo alone was convicted, he was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment and lost an appeal. Because short sentences are suspended in Italy, Restivo remained free and without restriction on his movements. The prosecution appealed against the acquittal of Claps' friend, and at a second trial she was found guilty on a charge of perjury and sentenced to 14 months' imprisonment; the Italian Supreme Court later overturned the conviction.\nWhen the body of Claps was discovered, it became clear that her friend had been telling the truth. She testified via a video link at Restivo's trial for murdering Barnett.\n\nIn May 2002 Restivo arrived in England, and moved in with a Bournemouth woman. He lived across the street from Barnett, a mother of two who worked from home as a seamstress. Restivo visited Barnett's flat on 6 November 2002, ostensibly to discuss having curtains made. On 12 November 2002, Barnett was found by her children, aged 11 and 14, when they came home from school. She had been bludgeoned to death with a hammer and her breasts, which had been severed, were beside her head. A lock of hair, which was not Barnett's, had been placed in her right hand and some of her own hair was under her left hand. The time of death was estimated to be shortly after Barnett had returned home after taking her children to school that morning.\n\nRestivo was not immediately a person of interest for detectives. Along with his Italian landlady, Fiamma, he was taken to Bournemouth Police station on the evening of the 12th. With no translator to hand, Fiamma translated. At that interview, Restivo produced his timed and dated bus ticket. There were a number of innocent victims arrested prior to Restivo. Restivo was questioned by the Police in mid 2003 and released without charge. At an early stage he had produced a bus ticket with a time-stamp of 8:44 a.m. to support his alibi of having been on his way to a computer course at the time of the murder. The detective heading the inquiry later said that Restivo gave the impression of being \"bumbling\". Forensic investigation showed the killer had left few traces at the crime scene. Luminol tests showed a trail of bloody shoe-prints that ended suddenly, this was thought to indicate the killer had changed his shoes before leaving Barnett's house. Although Barnett's son told police the day after the murder that his mother's keys went missing after Restivo's visit of 6 November, and he was found to have soaked the trainers he had worn on 12 November in bleach, Restivo was not strongly suspected at first because of his bus ticket.\n\nIn the light of Restivo's connection to Claps' disappearance and suspicious behaviour detectives regarded him as chief suspect, but there was not sufficient evidence for a prosecution. In March 2004 he was put under close surveillance using electronic tracking and listening devices; police overheard Restivo being spoken to by his parents and female companion as if he were a child. He was observed on repeated visits to a beauty spot where he was covertly filmed as he apparently stalked lone women. On 12 May 2004 the surveillance team became alarmed, a uniformed patrol was ordered to stop and search Restivo on a pretext. Although it was a warm day, he was wearing waterproof over-trousers. In his car police found an identical change of clothing, filleting knife, scissors, a balaclava and gloves. In June 2004 a schoolgirl identified Restivo as the man who had cut her hair on a bus; in November 2006 he was rearrested and his home searched. Police found a lock of hair. Trainers he had worn on the day of the murder had traces of blood, but it could not be identified. In 2008 new techniques revealed a bloodstained towel left at the murder scene had a DNA match for Restivo, but he claimed to have left it on the visit to the home of Barnett on 6 November. The evidence was still judged insufficient for a prosecution.\n\nPriest Domenico Sabia from Potenza died in 2008; he had denied ever being acquainted with Restivo, but a photograph of Restivo's 18th birthday party emerged that showed Sabia had been one of the guests. In March 2010 a body was found in the church, in a brick alcove beside the bell tower. Forensic DNA analysis initially suggested the body was not that of Claps, but on re-testing it was found to be hers. Strands of Claps' own hair had been cut from her head shortly after her death and placed near her hands. Italian investigation found DNA and other evidence indicating Restivo was the murderer of Claps.\nIn a move that the prosecutor said was unrelated to the Italian investigation, it was decided that the evidence against Restivo was sufficient for a prosecution. Two months after the remains of Claps were found, Restivo was charged with the murder of Barnett.\nElisa's funeral service took place on July 2, 2011, and the holy mass was celebrated by Don Marcello Cozzi, an Italian priest well known for his strong battles against the mafia and crime. A large number of people from all Italy took part to the ceremony.\n\nIt was ruled that the English court could hear evidence that Restivo had murdered Elisa Claps in Italy, and about the similarities of that murder with the murder of Barnett. Italian investigators testified to the English court that DNA recovered from the clothes on the body of Claps matched Restivo and was consistent with blood. When in May 2011, Restivo was found guilty of murdering Heather Barnett, the judge sentenced him to spend the rest of his life in prison. Appealing against the whole life term, Restivo's lawers argued the judge was wrong to take the Claps' murder into account when sentencing Restivo for the murder of Barnett, as Restivo had not been convicted of it at that time. In November 2012 the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Restivo and altered his minimum sentence to 40 years, but said it was \"highly improbable\" he would ever be released. In 2014 Restivo appealed against a decision he should be deported, the Home Secretary having ordered his transfer to Italy, where he would be jailed for life.\n\nIn 2011 the Criminal Cases Review Commission began examining the conviction of Omar Benguit to determine whether it should be referred to the Court of Appeal. After juries at two previous trials had failed to agree on a verdict, Benguit was found guilty in January 2005 on a charge of murdering Jong-Ok Shin, a 26-year-old Korean woman who had come to England to study. She was attacked yards from her home, three blocks from where Restivo lived, in the early hours of 12 July 2002. One criminologist expressed the opinion that the likelihood of different killers with similar long-bladed knives committing murders three streets apart within four months is \"very, very small\". Benguit's lawyers said the main prosecution witness in the case was unreliable; while several lines of circumstantial evidence pointed to Restivo. In a 2014 hearing, the Court of Appeal ruled the verdict was consistent with the testimony from the witness, who had not changed her evidence, and Benguit's conviction was upheld.\n\n\n"}

The company offers a range of services, including the supply of security personnel, monitoring equipment, response units and secure prisoner transportation. G4S also works with governments overseas to deliver security.\n\nIt is the world's largest security company measured by revenues and has operations in more than 90 countries. With over 570,000 employees, it is the world's third-largest private employer, the largest European and African private employer, and among the largest on the London Stock Exchange. G4S was founded in 2004 by the merger of the UK-based Securicor plc with the Denmark-based Group 4 Falck.\n\nG4S has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.\n\nG4S has its origins in a guarding business founded in Copenhagen in 1901 by Marius Hogrefe, originally known as \"København Frederiksberg Nattevagt\" (\"Copenhagen and Frederiksberg Night Watch\") and subsequently renamed \"Falck\" (\"Falcon\").\nIn 2000, Group 4, a security firm formed in the 1960s, merged with \"Falck\" to form \"Group 4 Falck\" and by 2000 the company was described as \"the world's largest private security systems company\". In 2002 \"Group 4 Falck\" went on to buy The Wackenhut Corporation in the United States.\n\nG4S was formed in July 2004, when Group 4 Falck's security business merged with Securicor to create Group 4 Securicor and began trading on both the London and Copenhagen Stock Exchanges. In 2005, Lars Nørby Johansen was succeeded as chief executive by Nick Buckles and, in 2006, the new G4S brand identity was rolled out across its business worldwide. In the same year, Alf Duch-Pedersen succeeded Jorgen Philip-Sorensen to become the non-executive chairman of the business.\n\nIn 2006, 2007 and 2008, G4S was the subject of a global campaign by union workers alleging that its subsidiaries undermine labour and human rights standards. Some of these groups were organised under the banner of the SEIU-funded Focus on Group 4 Securicor. This group supported protests at Group 4 Securicor's annual general meeting in London in 2005.\n\nThe 2006, \"US State Department Report on Human Rights in Indonesia\", released in March 2006, featured the ongoing dispute in Jakarta with Group4/Securicor. In July 2006, the Indonesian Securicor workers had a substantial win – but the campaigners continue to support other Group 4 Securicor workers. The company disputed these claims and pointed to its strong relationships with unions around the world, including the GMB in Britain. In March 2008, it was announced that G4S were taking over Scottish Rock Steady Group – who steward at major sporting and music events mostly in the UK. Rock Steady events have included Live8 concerts in London, Scottish FA Cup Final & the Download Festival. In April 2008, G4S acquired RONCO Consulting Corporation, one of the world's premier humanitarian and commercial mine action, ordnance disposal and security companies.\n\nIn May 2008, G4S acquired ArmorGroup International. GSL, a provider of outsourced justice services, was also acquired by G4S in May 2008. Also, in the same month, G4S acquired Serbian company Progard Securitas. In 2008, G4S also acquired Touchcom, Inc. for US$23 million. Touchcom, Inc. is located in the Burlington/Bedford, Massachusetts, area. The rebranding of Touchcom, Inc. to G4S was completed by 1 January 2012. In December 2008, G4S and UNI Global Union, announced the launch of an \"Ethical Employment Partnership\", which will drive improvements in standards across the global security industry. Simultaneous to this, G4S and the SEIU reached an agreement to end their long dispute and establish a framework to work together in the interest of employees.\n\nIn 2009, G4S continued to acquire companies: Secura Monde International Limited and Shiremoor International Engineering Limited, together, the UK's leading specialist banknote and high security technical and commercial advisory companies; All Star International for $60 million, one of the premier facilities management and base operations support companies providing services to the US government; Adesta, US-based provider of integrated security systems and communication systems; and Hill & Associates Consultants Limited, Asia's leading provider of specialist risk-mitigation consulting services. The Västberga helicopter robbery occurred on 23 September 2009 at 05:15 CET when a G4S cash service depot was robbed in Västberga in southern Stockholm, Sweden. In the autumn of 2009, G4S personnel in Australia went on strike, arguing that the company had subjected them to low pay and poor working conditions. The strike imperiled the operations of the court system in the state of Victoria. The guards provided entry-point screening for weapons and bombs in both the County Court and Magistrates Court, as well as additional security in the court rooms themselves.\n\nG4S acquired the South African cash in transit company Skycom in September 2010. Then in April 2011, it bought the Cotswold Group, a surveillance and investigations company.\n\nIn April 2011, G4S acquired Guidance Monitoring, an international designer and manufacturer of electronic monitoring technologies, including hardware and software used for offender monitoring and tracking. In December 2011, G4S acquired the assets of Chubb Emergency Response, a large key holding company in the UK. The deal was finalised on 17 December 2011. The business has now been integrated into their existing key holding and response service.\n\nOn 17 October 2011, G4S announced it would purchase the Denmark-based facilities management group ISS A/S for £5.2 billion. The acquisition would have created the world's largest facilities management company. Within two weeks, the deal was dropped due to lack of shareholder support. G4S's chief, Nick Buckles, recounted the events of the failed acquisition, which cost the company tens of millions of dollars, as \"...one of the most bruising experiences of my life\". A combination of institutional investors who led the response and the minority shareholders who followed, objected to a variety of factors, not the least of which was the additional leverage and debt the deal would introduce to G4S's balance sheet. General consensus is that lack of planning for shareholder response on the G4S side doomed the deal. Furthermore, many investors and analysts questioned why the company would want to purchase a firm so far removed from its area of expertise. Alf Duch-Pedersen resigned as G4S chairman after the failure of this acquisition and was replaced by John Connolly.\n\nIn March 2012, G4S announced that it would sell the \"struggling\" G4S Government Solutions business (the former Wackenhut (WSI) and All Star business) to exit the US government services. In May 2013, Buckles resigned as chief executive of G4S with £1.2 million payoff and was replaced by Ashley Almanza.\n\nOn 12 July 2012, it was announced that 3,500 British troops would be deployed at the 2012 Summer Olympics due to a shortage of adequately trained G4S security staff, with Labour MP Keith Vaz claiming that, \"G4S has let the country down and we have literally had to send in the troops\". Shares in G4S later dropped 9 percent after the firm claimed it faced a possible £50 million loss as a result of failing to provide sufficient trained staff for the 2012 Olympic Games. On 17 July, the company's chief executive, Nick Buckles, appeared before the Home Affairs Select Committee, where he apologised for the organisational failings, expressed regret at having taken on the Olympic security contract, and agreed in principle to pay bonuses to soldiers drafted at the last moment as replacement security staff. Pressed by Labour MP David Winnick, he was forced to admit that organisational situation had become a \"humiliating shambles\".\n\nIn Newcastle, G4S was replaced by 500 staff from local security firms for Olympic events.\nIn Scotland, G4S was stripped of the security role with it passing to Strathclyde Police. At Dorney Lake, the Olympic rowing and canoeing venue, a G4S manager reported G4S radios were not working, so staff were relying on personal mobile phones to communicate; G4S confirmed the venue was being manned by military personnel after 66 percent of rostered G4S staff were failing to show. The venue manager reported parts of the CCTV system had already been replaced by Army patrols and a complete army takeover was \"on the cards\".\n\nOn 22 July 2012, a contractor reported that a third of his expected staff had not turned up; instead, he was sent a group of mainly female, teenage students with minimal training, whom he turned away as he did not feel comfortable leaving them for night duties. On 8 August 2012, G4S announced that it had finally contracted enough employees to fully fulfil its contract for the Olympic games. Although missing its initial target of 10,000, G4S announced the sending of 7,000 personnel each day to Olympic venues, in a way they felt would allow them to fully secure each venue. Subsequent to the Olympics contract failures, the chief constables of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire were to recommend abandoning outsourcing work to G4S. They were backed by Jim Paice, the agriculture minister and Conservative MP for South East Cambridgeshire. Following the Olympic Games, G4S provided a donation of £2.5 million to military charities as a goodwill gesture.\n\nG4S announced in late August 2012 that it would be selling its Pakistan division, Wackenhut Pakistan Limited, to its chairman Ikram Sehgal for a figure of around $10 million, according to the \"Financial Times\".\nSehgal disputed this figure, calling it \"speculative\" to the \"Express Tribune\".\n\nG4S was one of the nominees for the 2013 Public Eye Award, a counter-event created by NGOs, which awards the worst company of the year.\n\nG4S was in the news in June 2016 because of employee Omar Mateen, the gunman behind one of the worst mass-shooting incidents in United States history, who was employed as a security guard by the company. In October 2006, Mateen had begun working as a recruit for the Florida Department of Corrections, being assigned to the Martin Correctional Institution. In a letter explaining his juvenile record as part of his successful application, Mateen explained the incident of when he was arrested at school when he was fourteen. Following the Virginia Tech shooting in April 2007, Mateen suggested in a corrections officer training class that he would bring a gun to class. P.H. Skipper, who was the warden at institution, wrote that \"in light of the tragic events at Virginia Tech officer Mateen's inquiry about bringing a weapon to class is at best extremely disturbing\". Days later on 27 April 2007, Mateen \"was involuntarily dismissed\" from the program and never became a certified corrections officer.\n\nMateen then worked for British-based security firm G4S Secure Solutions in Jupiter, Florida, from September 2007 until his death. The company said two screenings of Mateen—one conducted upon hiring and the other in 2013—had raised no red flags. Nonetheless, G4S removed Mateen from his job post at a courthouse because of threats he made towards coworkers, including one threat where he claimed he would have al-Qaeda kill a deputy's family. Mateen had claimed that his coworkers and courthouse deputies were making racist comments towards him. Despite this, G4S \"kept Mateen as an employee\" but moved him \"to a kiosk at a gated community in Palm Beach County.\" They never informed the community or its property management company about why he was transferred there.\n\nMateen held an active concealed carry permit and an armed security guard licence. He was said to have passed a psychological test and medical exam performed by Dr. Syed Shafeeq Rahman, who had close ties with Mateen's family. It was also noted that Mateen had no criminal record. According to licensing records, he was a proficient shooter who scored in the 98th percentile with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol.\n\nAfter the shooting, a psychologist, who was said to have evaluated and cleared Mateen for his firearms licence in 2007, according to the records of the security company G4S, denied ever meeting him or having lived in Florida at the time, and said she had stopped her practice in Florida in January 2006. G4S admitted Mateen's form had a \"clerical error\", and clarified that he had instead been cleared by Rahman, who was from the same firm that bought the wrongly-named doctor's practice. Rahman had not interviewed Mateen, but evaluated the results of a standard test used in the screening he undertook before being hired.\n\nIn October 2011, the security firm spent £499,000 replacing all the locks and keys at HMP Birmingham. A G4S spokesman acknowledged: \"As has previously been extensively reported,\" this loss happened 18 days after G4S took over the prison in 2011.\n\nOn 16 December 2016, some 600 prisoners took part in a riot at HM Prison Birmingham, a prison in Birmingham, England, operated by G4S. The disturbance was described as the worst in Britain since the 1990 Strangeways riot. The national chairman of the Prison Officers Association said more than 30 officers at the prison had quit in the weeks before the riot and that further prison convulsions were inevitable.\n\nIn a statement to Parliament, Secretary of State for Justice Elizabeth Truss said that insufficient staffing lay at the root of the twelve-hour Birmingham riot and that G4S would have to pay the costs of deploying ten highly trained public sector Tornado elite teams, who were sent to quell the riot. John Thornhill, the president of the independent monitoring board, agreed that insufficient staff had caused rising levels of violence in prisons in England and Wales, leading to \"unrestrained violence\" and the transfer of a \"large number of prisoners ... to other prisons that are already stretched with their own problems and staffing issues.\"\n\nIn August 2018 its contract to run Birmingham Prison was revoked, after Peter Clarke, the Government's Chief Inspector of Prisons reported that it was the worst he had ever visited.\n\nBen Saunders, the head of two British immigrant centers that have been the locus of abuse of detainees was put on leave in September 2017. A parliamentary committee chair and the Opposition Labour shadow home secretary complained that G4S's contract with the Home Office limited it to a 6.8% profit on operations, but instead the pre-tax profit margins appear to have ranged between 20% to 30%. Saunders had previously directed the Medway Secure Training Centre where juveniles had been found to have been abused before G4S had divested itself of its youth detention component.\n\nG4S's core services include 'manned security services' – where it provides trained and screened security officers. The company also provides 'security systems' such as access control, CCTV, intruder alarms, fire detection, video analytics and security and building systems integration technology. 'Monitoring and response services' is another core service, where G4S provides key holding, mobile security patrol and response services and alarm receiving and monitoring facilities. G4S also provides 'secure facilities services' which includes integrated facilities services for entire sites or estates for commercial customers and governments. The business provides 'risk management and consultancy services' which also includes mine detection and clearance services. G4S also provides electronic tagging and monitoring of offenders at home or in the community. The company provides back-office support functions for police forces, support for front-line policing, including the provision of custody suite services and forensic medical services. It also manages juvenile and adult custody centres. This includes the management of all aspects of a facility and those held within the facility – similar centres are also used for the detention of asylum applicants. Prisoner escorting is another core service. G4S transports prisoners and asylum applicants between courts, police stations and custody centres.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the company (then still known as Group 4 Falck) bid unsuccessfully for the right to operate several railway franchises in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2013, G4S Forensic and Medical Services were awarded a three-year contract to run services providing medical examinations and counselling for victims of rape and sexual assault in the West Midlands. It has been working in this area since 2005. The firm provides patient transport services for NHS Trusts including Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust; Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust; St George's Healthcare NHS Trust (£2.7 million a year), and Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust (£3.5 million a year).\n\nOne of G4S' more interesting contracts may be securing the perimeter of Homey Airport, more commonly known as Area 51, the secret United States Air Force base in Nevada. The base is guarded by civilians forces referred to by those who watch the base as Cammo Dudes. As neither the US Government nor Military will discuss Area 51 there is no official answer on who the guards work for however as a result of evidence pieced together from a leaked handbook for the guards and local job adverts it is widely believed they work for G4S. \n\nAs of 2018, G4S operates two private prisons in Australia: Mount Gambier Prison and Port Phillip Prison.\n\nG4S segments its business into two areas:\n\nIn 2011, G4S became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, the international standard to promote socially responsible business behaviour including human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. In 2013, G4S launched a Human Rights Policy, co-authored by Dr Hugo Slim, an internationally recognised human rights expert, aiming to align the company's practices with 'UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights' and to introduce additional global guidelines for areas not currently covered by existing standards.\n\nG4S is a founder signatory of the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers (ICoC), a multi-stakeholder initiative convened by the Swiss government.\n\nIn 2007, G4S began the G4S 4teen, an award-winning program to support 14 young athletes around the world. G4S provided financial, social and logistical support to a number of athletes taking part in London 2012, including Colombian cyclist and 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medallist Mariana Pajon, Kenyan long-distance runner Pauline Korikwiang, and Estonia's former discus thrower and shot-putter, now-Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Margus Hunt.\n\nControversies involving the company have included use of immigrant-detainee labour in prisons, extreme misconduct in child custodial institutions in the UK and the US, allegations of police telephone data manipulation, its troubled nine-year employment of Orlando, Florida terrorist Omar Mateen, and the 2016 riot at Birmingham Prison in Birmingham, England.\n\n\n"}

His mother was a cleaning lady and his father was a seaman who fought in World War II, subsequently being held as a prisoner of war by the Soviet Union until 1951. As a young man, Fascher was a promising amateur boxer, becoming flyweight champion of West Germany. He had been expected to represent his country at the 1960 Olympics, but after accidentally killing a sailor in a street fight he served six months in prison and was given a lifetime ban from boxing. After his release, Fascher became involved in the emerging rock and roll scene around Hamburg's Reeperbahn, working as a barman and bouncer in the music clubs and managing groups.\n\nWhen the Beatles (including original drummer Pete Best and bassist Stuart Sutcliffe) made their first trip to Germany in August 1960, Fascher befriended the young group, who played at the Indra Club and the Kaiserkeller. As they rose through the ranks of bands playing the Reeperbahn (making five trips in all over the next two-and-a-half years), Fascher usually managed to be working at the same clubs, and for the same boss, as the Beatles. They visited him at home, and he in turn kept troublemakers away from the band. The only favour Fascher asked was to be able to sing with them occasionally onstage, which was granted; Eddie Cochran's music was a common choice.\n\nThe Beatles (with Best now replaced by Ringo Starr, and Paul McCartney changing to bass when Sutcliffe departed) did not want to make their last Hamburg visit, at the end of 1962, preferring to stay in England to promote their new single, \"Love Me Do\", but were persuaded by manager Brian Epstein, via Horst Fascher, who recalled later \"I had to give him thirty marks under the table to make him do it.\" Nonetheless, the band had a holiday residency at the Star-Club (which Fascher co-ran), through the New Year.\n\nFascher guested with the Beatles during their New Year's Eve show, which was recorded by another Liverpool musician, Ted \"Kingsize\" Taylor. Years later (in 1977), the tape was released commercially as \"Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962\". A song from the album, \"Hallelujah, I Love Her So\", features Horst Fascher's vocals. Another song, \"Be-Bop-A-Lula\", features his brother Fred's vocals.\n\nFascher remained a friend and admirer of the band years after they became famous. Some of his stories about the band's Hamburg days (and his impressions of the young Beatles) have found their way into music biographies, including Philip Norman's \"Shout!\". His own memoir was published in 2006.\n\n"}

He was granted authority by James I of Aragon over the castles of Cinca, Malda, and Maldanell as a reward for his participation in the conquest of Valencia. He bought the castle of Alcarrás from Guillem de Cardona in 1249. \n\nIn the fourteenth century the members of this branch resided on \"carrer Major\" of Lleida and lorded over territories that include Alcarràs, Montagut, Sarroca de Lleida, Llardecans, and Vilanova de Remolins. The house also owned large estates in Flix and La Palma d'Ebre (the last two were sold to Barcelona in 1398). \n\nFrancesc de Santcliment, is one of the notable figures in the Lleida branch of the House of Santcliment. He served under Peter IV of Aragon, who sent him as ambassador to Avignon in 1336 and as a defender of the Aran Valley against the bishop of Comminges. Francesc founded the family chapel in the cathedral of Lleida. One of his children, Pere, was chancellor of the university of Lleida (1387-1403), canon, and then bishop of Lleida. His other son Francesc was \"paer\" in 1380 and \"veguer\" in 1413. The son of Francesc, Bernat de Santcliment, carried out a long lawsuit against the chapter of Lleida due to a dispute over a property near Montagut, which he lost. He also fought in the war against John II of Aragon in 1467 and was \"paer\". By the sixteenth century, this branch was already in decline after losing Alcarrás, Sarroca, and Llardecans.\n\nPere de Santcliment was the first prominent member of the Santcliment branch in Barcelona. He was mentioned by James I of Aragon as \"our scribe.\" The members of this branch continued to serve as \"notari major\" of the chancery under Peter III of Aragon. The court positions held by the House helped this Barcelona branch amass fortune. The Santcliments continued to invest in the purchase of lands in addition to their small lordship near the Catalan capital in order to ensure their relevance to the group of distinguished citizens. The Barcelona barnch of the Santcliment had a rich heritage and their legacy can be traced in their properties in and around Barcelona and these include: the \"torre de Bell-lloc\" in Sant Andreu de Palomar, consisting of mills and farms; the \"Torre Vella\" in Badalona; the \"casa de la Murtra\" near Santa Coloma. In addition, the Santcliment was granted land holdings after the conquest of Sardinia and a member of this house was part of Spain's campaign to control the island.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15192", "title": "Isaac", "text": "Isaac\n\nIsaac is one of the three patriarchs of the Israelites, according to the biblical Book of Genesis. In the biblical narrative, he was the son of Abraham and Sarah and father of Jacob; his name means \"he will laugh\", reflecting when both Abraham and Sarah laughed in disbelief when told that they would have a child. He is the only patriarch whose name was not changed, and the only one who did not move out of Canaan. According to the narrative, he died when he was 180 years old, the longest-lived of the three.\n\nThe story of Isaac is important in the Abrahamic religions including Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Many modern scholars doubt the existence of figures from Genesis, including Isaac.\n\nThe anglicized name Isaac is a transliteration of the Hebrew term \"Yiṣḥāq\" (יִצְחָק) which literally means \"He laughs/will laugh.\" Ugaritic texts dating from the 13th century BCE refer to the benevolent smile of the Canaanite deity El. Genesis, however, ascribes the laughter to Isaac's parents, Abraham and Sarah, rather than El. According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell on his face and laughed when God (Hebrew, \"Elohim\") imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. He laughed because Sarah was past the age of childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age. Later, when Sarah overheard three messengers of the Lord renew the promise, she laughed inwardly for the same reason. Sarah denied laughing when God questioned Abraham about it.\n\nIn Amos, Isaac is spelled not with a צ but with a ש - Amos 7:9 ישחק.\n\nIt was prophesied to the patriarch Abraham that he would have a son and that his name should be Isaac. When Abraham became one hundred years old, this son was born to him by his first wife Sarah. Though this was Abraham's second son it was Sarah's first and only child.\n\nOn the eighth day from his birth, Isaac was circumcised, as was necessary for all males of Abraham's household, in order to be in compliance with Yahweh's covenant.\n\nAfter Isaac had been weaned, Sarah saw Ishmael mocking, and urged her husband to cast out Hagar the bondservant and her son, so that Isaac would be Abraham's sole heir. Abraham was hesitant, but at God's order he listened to his wife's request.\n\nAt some point in Isaac's youth, his father Abraham brought him to Mount Moriah. At God's command, Abraham was to build a sacrificial altar and sacrifice his son Isaac upon it. After he had bound his son to the altar and drawn his knife to kill him, at the very last moment an angel of God prevented Abraham from proceeding. Rather, he was directed to sacrifice instead a nearby ram that was stuck in thickets.\nBefore Isaac was 40 (Gen 25:20) Abraham sent Eliezer, his steward, into Mesopotamia to find a wife for Isaac, from his nephew Bethuel's family. Eliezer chose the Aramean Rebekah for Isaac. After many years of marriage to Isaac, Rebekah had still not given birth to a child and was believed to be barren. Isaac prayed for her and she conceived. Rebekah gave birth to twin boys, Esau and Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when his two sons were born. Isaac favored Esau, and Rebekah favored Jacob.\n\nThe narratives about Isaac do not mention him having concubines.\n\nIsaac moved to \"Beer-lahai-roi\" after his father died. When the land experienced famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still under the control of King Abimelech as it was in the days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.\nIsaac grew old and became blind. He called his son Esau and directed him to procure some venison for him, in order to receive Isaac's blessing. While Esau was hunting, Jacob, after listening to his mother's advice, deceived his blind father by misrepresenting himself as Esau and thereby obtained his father's blessing, such that Jacob became Isaac's primary heir and Esau was left in an inferior position. According to Genesis 25:29–34, Esau had previously sold his birthright to Jacob for \"bread and stew of lentils\". Thereafter, Isaac sent Jacob into Mesopotamia to take a wife of his mother's brother's house. After 20 years working for his uncle Laban, Jacob returned home. He reconciled with his twin brother Esau, then he and Esau buried their father, Isaac, in Hebron after he died at the age of 180.\n\nAccording to local tradition, the graves of Isaac and Rebekah, along with the graves of Abraham and Sarah and Jacob and Leah, are in the Cave of the Patriarchs.\n\nIn rabbinical tradition, the age of Isaac at the time of binding is taken to be 37, which contrasts with common portrayals of Isaac as a child. The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac. The sacrifice of Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac, called the \"aqedah\" (\"binding\"). According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac as an agent of God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law.\n\nAccording to the Jewish tradition, Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer. This tradition is based on Genesis chapter 24, verse 63 (\"Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide\").\n\nIsaac was the only patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God told him not to do so. Rabbinic tradition gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as a sacrifice may not leave the Land of Israel. Isaac was the oldest of the biblical patriarchs at the time of his death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed.\n\nRabbinic literature also linked Isaac's blindness in old age, as stated in the Bible, to the sacrificial binding: Isaac's eyes went blind because the tears of angels present at the time of his sacrifice fell on Isaac's eyes.\n\nThe early Christian church continued and developed the New Testament theme of Isaac as a type of Christ and the Church being both \"the son of the promise\" and the \"father of the faithful\". Tertullian draws a parallel between Isaac's bearing the wood for the sacrificial fire with Christ's carrying his cross. and there was a general agreement that, while all the sacrifices of the Old Law were anticipations of that on Calvary, the sacrifice of Isaac was so \"in a pre-eminent way\".\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church consider Isaac as a Saint along with other biblical patriarchs. Along with those of other patriarchs and the Old Testament Righteous, his feast day is celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine rite of the Catholic Church on the Second Sunday before Christmas (December 11–17), under the title \"the Sunday of the Forefathers\".\n\nThe New Testament states Isaac was \"offered up\" by his father Abraham, and that Isaac blessed his sons. Paul contrasted Isaac, symbolizing Christian liberty, with the rejected older son Ishmael, symbolizing slavery; Hagar is associated with the Sinai covenant, while Sarah is associated with the covenant of grace, into which her son Isaac enters. The Epistle of James chapter 2, verses 21–24, states that the sacrifice of Isaac shows that justification (in the Johannine sense) requires both faith and works.\n\nIn the Epistle to the Hebrews, Abraham's willingness to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac is used as an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised by God to Abraham In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the resurrection of Jesus, the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac being a prefigure of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.\n\nIslam considers Isaac a prophet of Islam, and describes him as the father of the Israelites and a righteous servant of God.\n\nIsaac, along with Ishmael, is highly important for Muslims for continuing to preach the message of monotheism after his father Abraham. Among Isaac's children was the follow-up Israelite patriarch Jacob, who too is venerated an Islamic prophet.\n\nIsaac is mentioned fifteen times by name in the Quran, often with his father and his son, Jacob. The Quran states that Abraham received \"good tidings of Isaac, a prophet, of the righteous\", and that God blessed them both (37: 112). In a fuller description, when angels came to Abraham to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on Sodom and Gomorrah, his wife, Sarah, \"laughed, and We gave her good tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac of (a grandson) Jacob\" (11: 71–74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite Abraham and Sarah's old age. Several verses speak of Isaac as a \"gift\" to Abraham (6: 84; 14: 49–50), and 24: 26–27 adds that God made \"prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring\", which has been interpreted to refer to Abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson Jacob, and his prophetic great-grandson Joseph. In the Qur'an, it later narrates that Abraham also praised God for giving him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age (14: 39–41).\n\nElsewhere in the Quran, Isaac is mentioned in lists: Joseph follows the religion of his forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (12: 38) and speaks of God's favor to them (12: 6); Jacob's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the God that their forefathers, \"Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac\", worshiped (2: 127); and the Qur'an commands Muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to \"Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs\" (2: 136; 3: 84). In the Quran's narrative of Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son (37: 102), the name of the son is not mentioned and debate has continued over the son's identity, though many feel that the identity is the least important element in a story which is given to show the courage that one develops through faith.\n\nThe Quran mentions Isaac as a prophet and a righteous man of God. Isaac and Jacob are mentioned as being bestowed upon Abraham as gifts of God, who then worshipped God only and were righteous leaders in the way of God:\n\nSome scholars have described Isaac as \"a legendary figure\" or \"as a figure representing tribal history, or \"as a seminomadic leader.\" The stories of Isaac, like other patriarchal stories of Genesis, are generally believed to have \"their origin in folk memories and oral traditions of the early Hebrew pastoralist experience.\" \"The Cambridge Companion to the Bible\" makes the following comment on the biblical stories of the patriarchs:\n\nAccording to Martin Noth, a scholar of the Hebrew Bible, the narratives of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage than that of the West-Jordanian Jacob. At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern Philistia with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 (\"the high places of Isaac\").\n\nAlbrecht Alt and Martin Noth hold that, \"The figure of Isaac was enhanced when the theme of promise, previously bound to the cults of the 'God the Fathers' was incorporated into the Israelite creed during the southern-Palestinian stage of the growth of the Pentateuch tradition.\" According to Martin Noth, at the Southern Palestinian stage of the growth of the Pentateuch tradition, Isaac became established as one of the biblical patriarchs, but his traditions were receded in the favor of Abraham.\n\nThe earliest Christian portrayal of Isaac is found in the Roman catacomb frescoes. Excluding the fragments, Alison Moore Smith classifies these artistic works in three categories:\n\n\n\n"}

Bertram also served the Carnegie Corporation of New York from its inception in 1911 as secretary and trustee until his death in 1934. He thus continued to have an important role in Carnegie's philanthropic projects after Carnegie's death in 1919.\n\nBertram was born in Corstorphine, near Edinburgh, the Scottish capital where was educated at Daniel Stewart's College. His first position was with the Great Northern and Northeastern Railway company in Edinburgh. He emigrated to South Africa, where he continued to work in the railway industry. He returned to Scotland for health reasons in 1897, and was recruited by Andrew Carnegie, who had recently acquired a Scottish home, Skibo Castle.\n\nIn the US Bertram by 1908 supervised Carnegie's library program. He took a close interest in the new Carnegie libraries, commenting on the architectural plans submitted by applicants. Bertram's interventions discouraged extravagant architectural features and encouraged adherence to published guidelines. \n\nThe Carnegie Libraries in Iowa Project notes that Bertram was empowered by Andrew Carnegie to carry on negotiations, answer questions, and oversee contractual arrangements. The Carnegie Libraries in Iowa Project further asserts that Bertram, and not Carnegie, was the one who established the eligibility requirements for a community to receive funding. While he did not exhibit much of a fluid or articulate communication style -- leaving his letters, notes, responses, etc. more confused and misinformed than enlightened by his instructions, Bertram considered the power Carnegie entrusted to him as a kind of sacred trust demanding his protection. Therefore, Bertram established the primary requirements that the community population should be sufficiently large to support the library. He also determined, as time went on, that beautiful architectural enhancements that adorned the library buildings – domes, marble staircases, statues -- had to be eliminated in order to cut down on costs and to improve the libraries functionality and working space for library services. He began a campaign of informing inquiring groups with pamphlets on the need for practicality of design so that the grant amount would cover the construction costs to make it ready for immediate occupancy and fulfillment of its purpose. Bertram's rigorous guardianship of the Carnegie trust had the immediate effect he desired; however, it also caused substantial difficulties for some Iowa communities seeking to build libraries with Carnegie funding. It was these stipulations that Alice S. Tyler quietly but strongly objected to during her time as Secretary, seeking to have them removed and encouraging Iowa communities to pursue local financial support and reject the Carnegie funds. \n\nBertram authored \"Notes on Library Buildings\", a work which included complete plans, in 1910. Bertram also involved himself with grants for pipe organs, and other projects. Booker T. Washington's published correspondence gives details of how Bertram acted as an intermediary between Carnegie and the recipients of his largesse.\n"}

She arrived in Brussels in 1750, where she worked as a domestic and a prostitute and became known for being the mistress of many notables, such as the general governor Ollivier and vicomte de Quenonville, and had a daughter Marianne de Bellem, by an unknown father. In parallel, she had a serious and lifelong relationship with Henri Van der Noot.\n\nFrom 1787, Bellem was a well-known writer of political pamphlets, which encouraged the Belgians to follow the example of America and rise in rebellion toward Austria; she wrote the famous revolutionary poem: \"Peuple Belgique/cour tyrannique/faisons commet l'Amerique\". She was also politically active as the intermediary of Van der Noot, who spoke to the Belgian estates and maintained contact with them with her as messenger, as they did not dare to speak to Van der Noot directly. In 1788, during Noot's absence in London, she was arrested for her political activity and put on trial. The trial aroused great attention, but ended with her release after her public apology. She was arrested again in 1789 but was released shortly before the revolution, and gained troops for the rebellion. The 18 December 1789, Jeanne de Bellem participated in the entrance of Henri Van der Noot in Brussels in the carriage by his side and attended the theatre by his side.\n\nThe involvement of Jeanne de Bellem in the state affairs of the republic was controversial and she was the target of a lot of abusive caricatures by the opposition who used her as a way of criticizing Van der Noot and the government. She was called Noots official mistress, was said to encourage her lovers to attack the democrats in a contra-revolutionary coup, and when Van der Noot took the title of Duke, she was said to long for the title of Duchess. In parallel to the slander, however, she also received a great deal of praise and admiration. It was said that Jeanne de Bellem, Henri Van der Noot and their (male) colleague Eupen lived in a menage-a-trois. Bellem was also in charge of the pamphlets issued by the state.\n\nUpon the return of the Austrians and the death of the republic in 1790, Jeanne de Bellem was separated from Van der Noot and fled with her daughter Marianne to Breda in the Netherlands.\n\n\n"}

Several of the legendary members of this mythical king's family became leading characters of mythical tales in their own right.\n\nIn Welsh Arthurian literature from before the time of Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (\"History of the Kings of Britain\"), Arthur was granted numerous relations and family members. Several early Welsh sources are usually taken as indicative of Uther Pendragon being known as Arthur's father before Geoffrey wrote, with Arthur also being granted a brother (Madog) and a nephew (Eliwlod) in these texts. Arthur also appears to have been assigned a sister in this material – Gwalchmei is named as his sister-son (nephew) in \"Culhwch and Olwen\", his mother being one Gwyar. \"Culhwch and Olwen\", the \"Vita Iltuti\" and the \"Brut Dingestow\" combine to suggest that Arthur had a mother too, named Eigyr.\n\nIn addition to this immediate family, Arthur was said to have had a great variety of more distant relatives, including maternal aunts, uncles, cousins and a grandfather named Anlawd (or Amlawdd) Wledig (\"Prince Anlawd\"). The latter is the common link between many of these figures and Arthur: thus the relationship of first cousins that is implied or stated between Arthur, Culhwch, Illtud, and Goreu mab Custenhin depends upon all of their mothers being daughters of this Anlawd, who appears to be ultimately a genealogical construct designed to allow such inter-relationships between characters to be postulated by medieval Welsh authors. Arthur's maternal uncles in \"Culhwch and Olwen\", including Llygatrud Emys, Gwrbothu Hen, Gweir Gwrhyt Ennwir and Gweir Baladir Hir, similarly appear to derive from this relationship.\n\nThe genealogies from the 13th-century Mostyn MS. 117 assert that Arthur is the son of Uthyr, the son of Custennin, the son of Cynfawr, the son of Tudwal, the son of Morfawr, the son of Eudaf, the son of Cadwr the son of Cynan, the son of Caradoc, the son of Bran, the son of Llŷr.\n\nRegarding Arthur's own family, his wife is consistently stated to be Gwenhwyfar, usually the daughter of King Ogrfan Gawr (variation: 'Gogrfan Gawr', \"[G]Ogrfan the Giant\") and sister to Gwenhwyach, although \"Culhwch\" and \"Bonedd yr Arwyr\" do indicate that Arthur also had some sort of relationship with Eleirch daughter of Iaen, which produced a son named Kyduan (Cydfan). Kyduan was not the only child of Arthur according to Welsh Arthurian tradition – he is also ascribed sons called Amr (Anir), Gwydre, Llacheu and Duran.\n\nRelatively few members of Arthur's family in the Welsh materials are carried over to the works of Geoffrey and the chivalric romancers. His grandfather Anlawd Wledic and his maternal uncles, aunts and cousins do not appear there, and neither do any of his sons or his paternal relatives. Only the core family seem to have made the journey: his wife Gwenhwyfar (who became Guinevere), his father Uther, his mother (Igerna) and his sister-son Gwalchmei (Gawain). Gwalchmei's mother – Arthur's sister – failed to make the journey, Gwyar's place being taken by Anna, the wife of Loth, in Geoffrey's account, whilst Medraut (Mordred) is made into a second sister-son for Arthur (a status he does not have in the Welsh material). \n\nIn addition, new family members enter the Arthurian tradition from this point onwards. Uther is given a new family, including two brothers and a father, while Arthur gains a sister, Morgan le Fay (first named as Arthur's sister by Chrétien de Troyes), and a new son, Loholt, in Chrétien's \"Eric and Enide\", the \"Perlesvaus\" and the Vulgate Cycle. \n\nAnother significant new family-member is Arthur's half-sister Morgause, the daughter of Gorlois and Igerna and mother of Gawain and Mordred in the French romances (replacing Geoffrey of Monmouth's Anna in this role). In the Vulgate \"Mort Artu\" we find Mordred's relationship with Arthur once more reinterpreted, as he is made the issue of an unwitting incestuous liaison between Arthur and this Morgause, with Arthur dreaming that Mordred would grow up to kill him. This tale is preserved in all the romances based on the \"Mort Artu\", and by the time of Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" Arthur has started to plot, Herod-like, to kill all children born on the same day as Mordred in order to save himself from this fate. A third half-sister, Elaine, is also added at this time. Through his sisters, Arthur is given further nephews (Gareth, Gaheris, Agravain, Ywain, and Galeschin) who become Knights of the Round Table. \n\nAlthough Arthur is given sons in both early and late Arthurian tales, he is rarely granted significant further generations of descendants; this is at least partly because of the premature deaths of his sons in these legends. Amr is the first to be mentioned in Arthurian literature, appearing in the 9th-century \"Historia Brittonum\":\n\nWhy Arthur chose to kill his son is never made clear. The only other reference to Amr comes in the post-Galfridian Welsh romance \"Geraint\", where \"Amhar son of Arthur\" is one of Arthur’s four chamberlains along with Bedwyr's son Amhren. Gwydre is similarly unlucky, being slaughtered by the giant boar Twrch Trwyth in \"Culhwch and Olwen\", along with two of Arthur's maternal uncles – no other references to either Gwydre or Arthur's uncles survive.\n\nMore is known of Arthur's son Llacheu. He is one of the \"Three Well-Endowed Men of the Island of Britain\", according to the Triad 4, and he fights alongside Cei in the early Arthurian poem \"Pa gur yv y porthaur?\". Like his father is in \"Y Gododdin\", Llacheu appears in the 12th-century and later Welsh poetry as a standard of heroic comparison and he also seems to have been similarly a figure of local topographic folklore too. Taken together, it is generally agreed that all these references indicate that Llacheu was a figure of considerable importance in the early Arthurian cycle. Nonetheless, Llacheu too dies, with the speaker in the pre-Galfridian poem \"Ymddiddan Gwayddno Garanhir ac Gwyn fab Nudd\" remembering that he had \"been where Llacheu was slain / the son of Arthur, awful in songs / when ravens croaked over blood.\"\n\nFinally, Loholt is treacherously killed by Sir Kay so that the latter can take credit for the defeat of the giant Logrin in the \"Perlesvaus\". Another son, known only from a possibly 15th-century Welsh text, is said to have died on the field of Camlann:\n\nMedraut/Mordred is an exception to this tradition of a childless death for Arthur's sons. Mordred, like Amr, is killed by Arthur – at Camlann – according to Geoffrey of Monmouth and the post-Galfridian tradition but, unlike the others, he is ascribed two sons, both of whom rose against Arthur's successor and cousin Constantine with the help of the Saxons. However, in Geoffrey's \"Historia\" (when Arthur's killing of Mordred and Mordred's sons first appear), Mordred was not yet actually Arthur's son.\n\nLater literature has expanded Arthur's family further. Richard Johnson's 16th-century romance \"Tom a Lincoln\" adds another illegitimate son, the eponymous Tom. Through Tom, Arthur is also given grandsons referred to only as the Black Knight and Faerie Knight. Other works, such as Henry Fielding's \"Tom Thumb\", Walter Scott's \"The Bridal of Triermain\" and modern film and television adaptations of Arthurian legend, have occasionally given Arthur daughters, diverging from the earlier legends.\n\n"}

He was the most prominent of the Han Kitab writers who attempted to explain Muslim thought in the Chinese intellectual climate for a Hui Chinese audience, by frequently borrowing terminologies from Buddhism, Taoism and most prominently Neoconfucianism and aligning them with Islamic concepts. He was from the city of Nanjing. His magnum opus, T'ien-fang hsing-li or 'Nature and Principle in the Direction of Heaven', was considered the authoritative exposition of Islamic beliefs and has been republished twenty-five times between 1760 and 1939, and is constantly referred to by Muslims writing in Chinese.\n\nIn his childhood, he received instruction from his father, Liu Sanjie (劉三杰). At the age of 12, he studied scriptures with Yuan Ruqi (袁汝契) at the Garden of Military Studies Mosque in Nanjing, (which no longer exists). At the age of 15, he began a career of study in his home: for fifteen years, he read up on Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism and \"Western Studies.\" He considered Confucius and Mencius to be \"Sages of the East\" and Muhammad to be a \"Sage of the West,\" and that \"the teachings of the Sages of East and West, today as in ancient times, are one.\" He further believed that the scriptures of Islam are also \"generally similar to the intentions of Confucius and Mencius.\" From around the age of 30, he took up residence at the foot of Qingliangshan in Nanjing, where he began to interpret and expound on the Islamic scriptures, using Confucian studies, for a period of about twenty years. During this time, he twice brought his manuscript with him to visit and solicit advice and the opinions of both Muslims and non-Muslims, leaving his tracks throughout Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other places. In his later years, he resided at his studio, \"Saoyelou\" (\"House of Sweeping Leaves\"), at Qingliangshan in Nanjing.\n\nHe learned Arabic and studied both Buddhism and Daoism. He also wrote several works on Islam in 1674, 1710, and 1721.\n\nHis writings became part of the Han Kitab, a collection of literature which synthesized Islam and Confucianism.\n\nHe said that Muslims were allowed to believe in the Mandate of Heaven and serve the Emperor, because Allah allowed the Mandate of Heaven to exist.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "706621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=706621", "title": "Lucy van Pelt", "text": "Lucy van Pelt\n\nLucille \"Lucy\" van Pelt is a character in the syndicated comic strip \":Peanuts\", written and drawn by Charles Schulz. She is the older sister of Linus and Rerun. Lucy is characterized as a \"fussbudget\", crabby, bossy and opinionated girl who bullies most other characters in the strip, particularly Linus and Charlie Brown.\n\nLucy often mocks and intimidates others, especially Charlie Brown and her own younger brother, Linus. She also has a strong unrequited crush on Schroeder. She can be quite antagonistic, playing the villain role in a number of stories.\n\nChristopher Caldwell has said about the character: \"Lucy is no 'fussbudget.' She's an American nightmare, a combination of zero brains, infinite appetites and infinite self-esteem, who is (for that reason) able to run roughshod over all her playmates. At her best, she is the most terrifying character in the history of comics.\"\n\nWhile she often bullies and makes fun of characters like Charlie Brown, he still thinks of Lucy as a good friend and deep down, Lucy does have a fondness of him, with a couple of times that she said that \"he's full of surprises.\"\n\nLucy also operates a psychiatric booth, parodying the lemonade stand operated by many young children in the United States. Here, she offers advice and psychoanalysis for a nickel (five cents), usually to an anxious Charlie Brown. The \"advice\" is almost always worthless. However, on a few instances, Lucy’s advice may range from street-smart popular psychology, hilarious obvious truths, to somehow insightful investigation. One example is when, while treating Snoopy, Lucy asks him how he related, during his childhood, to the other (if you allow the expression) \"dogs\" in his family. Needless to say, Snoopy was quick to disallow the expression.\n\nA sign on the front of the booth declares that \"The Doctor is\" in or out, depending on which side of the \"In/Out\" placard is displayed. In \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", Lucy reverses the placard from displaying its \"Out\" side to reveal the words \"Real In\". Another time, on the title panel of a Sunday strip, it showed Lucy chewing gum, and the sign read \"The Doctor is Preoccupied.\"\n\nOn Charlie Brown's baseball team Lucy plays right field (or occasionally center field), and is characterized as a bad player, who, when temporarily kicked off the team, turns to heckling the games. Lucy has a knack for coming up with a nonsensical excuse for every fly ball she misses, such as \"The moons of Saturn got in my eyes\" or \"I think there were toxic substances coming from my glove, and they made me dizzy.\" Other times, she finds an excuse to have one-sided conversations with Charlie Brown at the pitcher's mound, often over some trivial thing she noticed, which usually result in Charlie Brown blowing his top and yelling at her to \"Get back in rightfield where you belong!\"\n\nOnce, Charlie Brown berated her for letting fly balls drop, telling her he would not brook any more excuses; Lucy caught the ball cleanly, and tossed it back to him on the mound silently, after which he admitted he was actually looking forward to her next excuse. In a series of strips that later became part of the 2003 TV special \"Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown\", Charlie Brown traded Lucy to Peppermint Patty's baseball team for Marcie (and a pizza), but once Patty discovered what a terrible player Lucy really was, she traded her back. Even on the diamond, Lucy vainly flirts with Schroeder, who plays catcher on Charlie Brown's team.\n\nThe third new character in \"Peanuts\" after Violet and Schroeder, Lucy made her debut on March 3, 1952. She was originally a goggle-eyed toddler who continually annoys her parents and the older kids, but aged up over the next two years so that by 1954, she was the same age as Charlie Brown (the early strips with toddler-age Lucy were not reprinted until after Charles Schulz’s death). Schulz then altered Lucy's eyes to have the same appearance as that of the other characters, except for small extra lines around them which were also sported by her two siblings.\n\nLucy has short, black hair and wears a blue dress with blue socks and saddle shoes until the 1970s when Schulz began showing the strip's female characters in pants and shirts in order to keep their outfits more contemporary. By the late 1980s, she had switched to this look permanently.\n\nLucy frequently pulls the football away from Charlie Brown right as he is about to kick it.\n\nThe first occasion on which she did this was November 16, 1952 (Violet unintentionally did the same thing a year before because she was afraid Charlie Brown would accidentally kick \"her\"), but unlike subsequent stunts, Lucy first pulled the ball away because she did not want Charlie Brown to get it dirty (he took a second try in the same strip, only to trip over it at the end).\n\nThe football strips became an annual tradition, and Schulz did one every year for the rest of the strip's run. One infamous example of this is the animated special \"It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown\", where her actions (she pulled the ball away four times) cost the school football team a win in the Homecoming game, yet Charlie Brown is blamed even though he is clearly not at fault. Charlie Brown did in fact kick the football in the September 12, 1956 strip, but only because Schroeder was holding the ball.\n\nLucy was named after Louanne van Pelt, a former neighbor of Charles Schulz in Colorado Springs and, according to David Michaelis of Time Magazine, was modeled after Schulz's first wife, Joyce.\n\n"}

She volunteered as a nurse at the hospital in the Minsk Polytechnic Institute, which had been set up to care for wounded members of the Red Army. In addition to caring for the soldiers, she helped them escape by smuggling civilian clothing and false identity papers into the hospital. A patient told the Germans what Bruskina was doing, and she was arrested on October 14, 1941, by members of the Wehrmacht's 707th Infantry Division and the 2nd Schutzmannschaft Battalion, Lithuanian auxiliary troops under the command of Major Antanas Impulevičius. After being arrested, Bruskina wrote a letter to her mother on October 20, 1941:\n\nMasha Bruskin lived in Minsk with her mother, senior goods manager of the Book Trade Office of the BSSR State Publishing House. She studied well and read a lot. She was also a pioneer leader and a member of the school committee of Komsomol. in December 1938, the newspaper \"Pioneer of Belarus\" published a photograph of Masha with the caption: \"Masha Bruskina - the schoolgirl of 8th grade in school № 28, Minsk. She has only good and excellent marks in all subjects\". In June 1941, Maria Bruskina graduated from Minsk secondary school № 28.\n\nLocal German authorities decided on a public hanging to make an example of Bruskina, along with two other members of the resistance, 16-year-old Volodia Shcherbatsevich and World War I veteran Kiril Trus. Before being hanged, she was paraded through the streets with a placard around her neck which read, in both German and Russian: \"We are partisans and have shot at German troops\". Members of the resistance were made to wear similar signs whether or not they had actually shot at German troops. She and her two comrades were hanged in public on Sunday, October 26, 1941, in front of Minsk Kristall, a yeast brewery and distillery plant on Nizhne-Lyahovskaya Street (15 Oktyabrskaya Street today). The Germans let the bodies hang for three days before allowing them to be cut down and buried.\n\nPyotr Pavlovich Borisenko witnessed the execution:\n\nOlga Shcherbatsevich, the mother of Volodia Shcherbatsevich, was hanged the same day as her son with two other members of the resistance in front of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus.\n\nFor decades after the war, Bruskina was officially referred to only as \"the unknown girl\", allegedly due to antisemitism from Soviet authorities. Up to 2009, Bruskina's name was not acknowledged on the memorial plaque at the execution place. However, since 2009, a new memorial plaque at the execution place has been placed. The Russian inscription now reads \"Here on October 26, 1941 the Fascists executed the Soviet patriots K. I. Truss, V. I. Sherbateyvich and M. B. Bruskina\". Bruskina was first recognized in the 1960s, as most of her family and friends had been killed in the Minsk Ghetto. A monument for Bruskina was erected in HaKfar HaYarok in Israel, and a street was named after her in Jerusalem.\n\n\n"}

He was noted for his active resistance to westward expansion and the United States federal government. It is due to the courage and determination of Morning Star and other leaders that the Northern Cheyenne still possess a homeland in their traditional country in present-day Montana.\n\nAlthough he was known as \"Dull Knife\" (or \"Motšêške Ôhnêxahpo\" in Cheyenne, a translation of his Lakota name) to local settlers, U.S. military leaders, and other American Indians, his Cheyenne name is translated as \"Morning Star\". A Cheyenne warrior in every sense of the word, Morning Star was described by many writers of the era as \"an admirable outlaw\" comparable to the likes of Rob Roy and William Wallace.\n\nIn 1868, Morning Star represented his tribe at the signing of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Following Custer's Last Stand at the Battle of the Little Bighorn during the Great Sioux War of 1876, Morning Star allied with the Sioux and other tribes against the United States. However, after a destructive raid by American soldiers under Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie in which 200 lodges were destroyed and 700 livestock captured, most of the Cheyenne were eventually forced to surrender. They expected to live on reservations with the Sioux in the north, but were subsequently transported to the Darlington Agency in the Southern Cheyenne Reservation in the Indian Territory.\n\nUnable to hunt sufficient game while on the reservation, the tribe suffered from starvation and disease until September 1878, when Morning Star led the tribe north, back toward their ancient homelands. Fighting through, the Cheyenne were able to outmaneuver federal troops across the plains and in the Nebraska Sand Hills until they were captured near Fort Robinson. The tribe was said to have taken apart their guns and hidden the pieces under blankets or as necklaces and bracelets worn by children. Though Morning Star explained that his people would put up no further resistance if allowed to live with Red Cloud on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the Dakota Territory, the Army still insisted that they return south to the Southern Cheyenne reservation. On January 8, 1879, the Northern Cheyenne tried to escape the fort using the dismantled guns they had hidden upon their arrival, but they were quickly pursued; many Cheyenne, mostly women and children, were killed by federal troops in the Fort Robinson massacre. However, a few of the tribe managed to escape, including Morning Star, who eventually reached the Pine Ridge Agency and was held as a prisoner until he and the survivors were allowed to settle on a reservation near Fort Keogh in the Montana Territory.\n\nMorning Star died in 1883 and is interred on the Northern Cheyenne reservation at Lame Deer Cemetery. Chief Dull Knife College, which is also in Lame Deer, is named in his honor. As Dull Knife, his photograph appears in Dee Brown's 1971 bestseller \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\".\n\nActor Ian McDonald played Dull Knife in the May 1957 episode \"Dull Knife Strikes for Freedom\" on the ABC/Desilu western television series, \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", with Hugh O'Brian in the title role as deputy marshal Wyatt Earp. In the episode, Dull Knife leads his Indians from their reservation in Oklahoma Territory to their homeland in Montana, which they claim the U.S. government had promised them. Meanwhile, some of their braves attack and burn a white settlement.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "581822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=581822", "title": "Pierre d'Ailly", "text": "Pierre d'Ailly\n\nPierre d'Ailly (; Latin \"Petrus Aliacensis\", \"Petrus de Alliaco\"; 13519 August 1420) was a French theologian, astrologer, and cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nD'Ailly was born in Compiègne in 1350 or 1351 of a prosperous bourgeois family. He studied in Paris at the Collège de Navarre, receiving the licentiate in arts in 1367 and the masters a year later. and was active in university affairs by 1372. D'Ailly taught the Bible in 1375 and the \"Sentences\" of Peter Lombard in 1376–1377, and received the licentiate and doctorate in theology in 1381. He was affiliated with the Collège, serving as rector in 1384; among his pupils were Jean Gerson and Nicholas of Clémanges.\n\nThe church's Great Schism, between two popes, arose in 1378. In the spring of 1379 Pierre d'Ailly, in anticipation even of the decision of the University of Paris, had carried to the pope of Avignon, Clement VII the \"role\" of the French nation, but notwithstanding this prompt adhesion he was firm in his desire to put an end to the schism, and when, on the 20th of May 1381, the university decreed that the best means to this end was to try to gather together a general council, Pierre d'Ailly supported this motion before the king's council in the presence of the duke of Anjou. The dissatisfaction displayed shortly after by the government obliged the university to give up this scheme, and was probably the cause of Pierre d'Ailly's temporary retirement to Noyon, where he held a canonry. There he continued the struggle for his side in a humorous work, in which the partisans of the council are amusingly taken to task by the demon Leviathan.\n\nD'Ailly returned to prominence by leading the university's effort to secure removal of John Blanchard as chancellor, in which Blanchard was accused by d'Ailly before the Avignon antipope Clement VII of abuse of office. Subsequently, d'Ailly was twice entrusted with a mission to Clement VII in 1388 to defend the doctrines of the university, and especially those concerning the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin, against the preaching friar Jean de Montson, and in 1389 to petition in the name of the king for the canonization of the young cardinal Pierre de Luxembourg. The success which attended his efforts on these two occasions, and the eloquence which he displayed, perhaps contributed to his choice as the king's almoner and confessor. At the same time, by means of an exchange, he obtained to the highest dignity in the university, becoming chancellor of Notre Dame de Paris. This acceptability to many interests helps explain his advancement.\n\nD'Ailly served as chancellor of the University from 1389 to 1395, and Gerson succeeded him. Both were involved in expelling the Dominican Order from the university for refusing to embrace the idea of the Immaculate Conception and in the effort mentioned above to end the Great Schism by means of an ecumenical council.\n\nWhen Antipope Benedict XIII succeeded Clement VII at Avignon in 1394, Pierre d'Ailly was entrusted by the king with a mission of congratulation to the new pontiff. His obsequious language on this occasion, and the favours with which it was rewarded, formed a too violent contrast to the determined attitude of the university of Paris, which, tired of the schism, was even then demanding the resignation of the two pontiffs. Pierre d'Ailly himself had not long before taken part in the drawing up of a letter to the king in which the advantages of this double abdication were set forth, but since then his zeal had seemed to cool a little. Nevertheless, on his return from Avignon, he again in the presence of the king enlarged upon the advantages offered by the way which the university commended.\n\nBut the suspicions aroused by his conduct found further confirmation when he caused himself—or allowed himself—to be nominated bishop of Le Puy by Benedict on 2 April 1395. The great number of benefices which he held left room for some doubt as to his disinterestedness. Henceforward he was under suspicion at the university, and was excluded from the assemblies where the union was discussed.\n\nD'Ailly's ecclesiastical career prospered, however. After Le Puy, he was appointed bishop of Noyon, and bishop of Cambrai (1397). By virtue of this position, he became also a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. In order to take possession of his new episcopal see, he had to brave the wrath of Philip, duke of Burgundy, override the resistance of the clergy and bourgeoisie, and even withstand an armed attack on the part of several lords; but his protector, the duke of Orleans, had his investiture performed by Wenceslaus, king of the Romans. The latter, though a partisan of the pope of Rome, took the opportunity of enjoining on Pierre d'Ailly to go in his name and argue with the pope of Avignon, a move which had as its object to persuade Benedict to an abdication, the necessity of which was becoming more and more evident. However, the language of the bishop of Cambrai seems on this occasion to have been lacking in decision; however that may be, it led to no felicitous result. From this point on, he spent most of his energy to addressing the schism. Although he was slow at first to embrace the conciliar solution to the Schism, he was participating in councils by 1409.\n\nFrance next tried to bring violent pressure to bear to conquer the obstinacy of Benedict XIII by threatening a formal withdrawal from his obedience. Pierre d'Ailly, who, in spite of his attachment to the pope, had been carried away by the example of the kingdom, was among the first who, in 1403, after experience of what had happened, counselled and celebrated the restoration of obedience. He was sent by Charles VI on an embassy to Benedict and seized this opportunity of lavishing on the pontiff friendly congratulations mingled with useful advice. Two years later, before the same pontiff, he preached in the city of Genoa a sermon which led to the general institution, in the countries of the obedience of Avignon, of the festival of the Holy Trinity.\n\nAt the ecclesiastical council which took place at Paris in 1406, Pierre d'Ailly made every effort to avert a new withdrawal from the obedience and, by order of the king, took the part of defender of Benedict XIII, a course which yet again exposed him to attacks from the university party. The following year he and his disciple Gerson formed part of the great embassy sent by the princes to the two pontiffs, and while in Italy he was occupied in praiseworthy but vain efforts to induce the pope of Rome to remove himself to a town on the Italian coast, in the neighbourhood of his rival, where it was hoped that the double abdication would take place. Discouraged by his failure to effect this, he returned to his diocese of Cambrai at the beginning of 1408. At this time he was still faithful to Benedict, and the disinclination he felt to joining the members of the French clergy who were on the point of ratifying the royal declaration of neutrality excited the anger of Charles VI's government, and a mandate, which was however not executed, ordered the arrest of the bishop.\n\nIt was not until after the cardinals of the two colleges had led to the convocation of the Council of Pisa (1409) that Pierre d'Ailly renounced the support of Benedict XIII, and, for want of a better policy, again allied himself with the cause which he had championed in his youth. In the council lay now, to judge from his words, the only chance of salvation; and, in view of the requirements of the case, he began to argue that, in case of schism, a council could be convoked by any one of the faithful, and would have the right to judge and even to depose the rival pontiffs. This was, in fact, the procedure of the council of Pisa, in which Pierre d'Ailly took part. After the declaration of the deposition of the Roman pope Gregory XII and Benedict XIII, the council went on to the election of Alexander V (June 26, 1409). This pope reigned only ten months; his successor, John XXIII, raised Pierre d'Ailly to the rank of cardinal (June 6, 1411), and further, to indemnify him for the loss of the bishopric of Cambrai, conferred upon him the administration of that of Limoges (November 3, 1412), which was shortly after exchanged for the bishopric of Orange. He also nominated Pierre d'Ailly as his legate in Germany (March 18, 1413).\n\nForgetting these benefits, d'Ailly was one of the most formidable adversaries of John XXIII at the Council of Constance (1414–1418); with Gerson, d'Ailly was one of the leading theologians at the council. Convinced as he was of the necessity for union and reform, he contributed more than anyone to the adoption of the principle that, since the schism had survived the Council of Pisa, it was necessary again to take up the work for a fundamental union, without considering the rights of John XXIII any more than they had those of Gregory XII and Benedict XIII. From this point of view Pierre d'Ailly, together with his compatriot Cardinal Fillastre, took the preponderating part during the first few months. Afterwards, seeing the trend of events, he showed some uneasiness and hesitation. He refused, however, to undertake the defence of John XXIII, and only appeared in the trial of this pope to make depositions against him, which were sometimes of an overwhelming character.\n\nAmong the other matters which claimed his attention at Constance may be mentioned also the condemnation of the errors of John Wycliffe and the trial of Jan Hus. The reading in public of Hus's two treatises \"De Potestate ecclesiastica\" and \"De Reformatione Ecclesiae\" revealed, besides ideas very peculiar to himself on the reform and constitution of the church, his design of reducing the power of the English in the council by denying them the right of forming a separate nation (October 1November 1, 1416). By this campaign, which exposed him to the worst retaliation of the English, he inaugurated his role of \"procurator and defender of the king of France.\"\n\nWhen at last the question arose of giving the Christian world a new pope, this time sole and uncontested, Pierre d'Ailly defended the right of the cardinals, if not to keep the election entirely in their own hands, at any rate to share in the election, and he brought forward an ingenious system for reconciling the pretensions of the council with the rights of the College of Cardinals. In this way was elected Pope Martin V (November 11, 1417), and the task of Pierre d'Ailly was at last finished.\n\nAfter the council, d'Ailly returned to Paris. When in France's civil discord the Burgundian faction seized Paris in 1419, killing some professors in the process, he fled south and retired to Avignon. His former pupil Gerson settled nearby at a house of the Celestine Order. D'Ailly, known as the Cardinal of Cambrai, died in 1420 in Avignon.\n\nD'Ailly wrote extensively on the Schism, reform, astrology and other topics. His ideas on the powers of the college of cardinals and the infallibility of the general council were very influential. D'Ailly's \"Imago Mundi\" (1410), a work of cosmography, influenced Christopher Columbus in his estimates of the size of world land-mass. Many questions in science and astrology, such as calendar reform, attracted his attention. His views on astrology, expressed in several works, attempted to balance divine omniscience and human free will. D'Ailly's writings on the Schism put the crisis and the need for reform into an apocalyptic context. His astrology also was tied to the Schism, attempting to determine whether the division of the church was a sign of the coming of the Antichrist. His works began appearing in print before the end of the fifteenth century.\n\nIn \"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon\", Karl Marx wrote that d'Ailly had told advocates of ethical reform at the Council of Constance, \"Only the devil in person can still save the Catholic Church, and you ask for angels.\"\n\nThe crater Aliacensis on the Moon is named after him.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After nightfall Qoshqarbaev and several of his comrades raised the flag on the roof. However, because they had raised the flag in the night when it was too dark to take a photo, none of them were part of the iconic photo of Soviet soldiers raising the flag on 2 May. After the raising of the flag on 30 April it was shot down down by German snipers shortly before the Wehrmacht retook control of the building. However, by 2 May the Soviets retook control of the building and raised the flag again, bringing photographer Yevgeny Khaldei with them to capture a reenactment of the historic moment.\n\nQoshqarbaev was born on 19 October 1924 in the village of Akmolinsk in within the Kyrgyz ASSR, currently located within the present-day city of Astana. He was sent to an orphanage at the age of 13 after his was repressed and declared an \"enemy of the people\" during the Great Purge in 1937. After completing seven years of secondary school he worked in a factory until he was allowed to join the Red Army.\n\nImmediately after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Qoshqarbaev attempted to join the Red Army but was initially rejected because he was only sixteen years old at the time. He reapplied shortly before his eighteenth birthday in August 1942 and was sent for training in the city of Kokshetau, which he completed in 1943. He was then sent for officer training at the Tambov All-Commander Infantry School, which he graduated from with honors before being sent to the Eastern Front as a junior lieutenant in October 1944.\n\nIn 1945 Qoshqarbaev distinguished himself while leading a platoon on an assault on enemy defenses, located on the Western bank of the Oder River; on April 17, one day after breaking through the enemy bridgehead, he led his unit towards a river channel to establish a new bridgehead and continued the advance despite heavy resistance from Axis forces. After Soviet forces opened fire on approaching enemy forces Qoshqarbaev entered the water, led his unit in the perilous crossing, and proceeded to storm a German trench after reaching the western bank of the canal. During the heavy fighting of that engagement over 40 German soldiers were killed after the platoon seized three machine guns in hand-to-hand combat and opened fire on the remaining German soldiers in the trench. After taking over the trench they established a firing point and gunned down the remaining enemy combatants in the area. After Qoshqarbaev's success in the Oder offensive, his platoon became the first unit to cross the Spree river, doing so under heavy enemy fire. From the time of Oder crossing to when he raised the flag over the Reichstag in Berlin, his platoon killed over 200 German soldiers and held 184 of them hostage, took 27 high-caliber machine-guns, and obtained many other weapons that were once in the hands of enemy soldiers. When the war ended Qoshqarbaev was a Lieutenant and the commander of a reconnaissance platoon belonging the 674th Infantry Regiment in the 150th Infantry Division. \n\nQoshqarbaev initially placed the flag of the Soviet Union atop the staircase in front of the main entrance to the building on 30 April 1945 at 14:25 after sneaking into the building with another soldier, Grigory Bulatov. The flag was presented to the group of soldiers assigned to raising the flag over the building by a regimental commander; the meeting where the flag was given to them was held in Himmler's house. After Qoshqarbaev originally placed the flag in the entrance by the staircase under the watch of Ivan Klochkov they went on to place it atop the building; the soldiers then jumped out of a window and ran across the roof, but after coming under heavy fire they laid low on the roof for several hours and waited for the artillery fire to cease. While waiting for the opportunity to hoist up the flag Qoshqarbaev and Bulatov wrote their names and regiment numbers on the flag. After nightfall the artillery fire eventually died down and under the cover of darkness Bulatov and Qoshqarbaev raised the flag over the Reichstag. However, the flag was later shot down by German snipers. Qoshqarbaev and Bulatov were nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union but instead awarded the Order of the Red Banner; neither of them were present in the photo \"Raising a Flag over the Reichstag\" taken on 2 May by Yevgeny Khaldei. \n\nAfter the war, Qoshqarbaev was the manager of the Alma-Ata Hotel. Unlike another Kazakh hero of the war, Baurzhan Momyshuly, Qoshqarbaev was never awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, despite several petitions to Brezhnev from high-profile veterans of the war and other Kazakhs awarded the title of hero asking that Qoshqarbaev be declared a Hero of the Soviet Union. Many suspected the reason for his not receiving the award was the fact his father had been declared an enemy of the people. Qoshqarbaev passed away in August 1988. Over a decade after his death he was posthumously declared a Hero of Kazakhstan on 7 May 1999 by decree of the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev.\n\n"}

Ferguson (born Samuel Wragg Ferguson; November 3, 1834 – February 3, 1917) was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded cavalry in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. After the war, he also served as a member of the Mississippi River Commission.\n\nSamuel W. Ferguson graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1857. Before graduation, he joined Colonel Albert Sidney Johnson's Utah War to fight the Mormons. He then went to St. Louis to join his regiment. After the expedition, he was assigned to Fort Walla Walla in the Washington Territory, where he stayed from 1859 to 1860. This all changed when he received the results of the 1860 presidential election. Hearing of the election of Abraham Lincoln, he immediately resigned and left for Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn March 1861, Ferguson was commissioned a captain in the South Carolina militia, afterwards being appointed Lieutenant and aide-de-camp to C.S. Brigadier-General P. G. T. Beauregard. He was one of the officers who received the formal surrender of U.S. Major Robert Anderson at Fort Sumter, raised the first Confederate States flag, and posted the first guards at Fort Sumter. After the siege, he was sent to present the first Confederate flag struck by enemy shot to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. He was a lieutenant-colonel and aide-de-camp to General Beauregard during the Battle of Shiloh. During the Battle of Farmington, he was in the 28th Mississippi Cavalry Regiment. He commanded the unit while defending Vicksburg, and helped stop attacks made by U.S. Major-General William T. Sherman and U.S. Commodore David Porter.\n\nOn July 28, 1863, Ferguson was promoted to brigadier-general. He was subsequently recommended for promotion to Major-General, but Joseph Wheeler quickly objected. During Sherman's March to the Sea, Ferguson and his cavalrymen harassed the flank of the United States Army. When Sherman got close to Savannah, Ferguson's men left their horses and covered the Confederate retreat. He was then ordered to Danville, Virginia, but before arriving was ordered to go to Charlotte, North Carolina. From Charlotte he escorted Jefferson Davis into Georgia, where his unit was disbanded.\n\nAfter the war Ferguson moved to Greenville, Mississippi, where he practiced law. He married Catherine Sarah Lee, daughter of Henry William and Eleanor Percy Lee who was a cousin of Robert Edward Lee. In 1876, he was appointed as president of the United States Board of Mississippi River Commissioners. He was also secretary and treasurer of the Mississippi Levee Board. In 1894, twenty thousand to forty thousand dollars mysteriously disappeared from the Mississippi Levee Board, of which Ferguson was both secretary and treasurer. Later that year, he suddenly left and moved to his hometown of Charleston where worked as a civil engineer. After staying in Charleston, Ferguson moved to Ecuador. It would be many years before he returned. At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, he tried to join the war effort but he was turned down. On February 3, 1917, Ferguson died in Jackson, Mississippi, where he is buried at the Greenwood Cemetery along with other famous Confederate generals.\n\n\n\n"}

They also have other disabilities including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, cleft lip and palate, and ectodermal dysplasia. Neumeier endorses pro-choice activism while also strongly opposing contemporary eugenics, such as the idea that people should avoid bringing pregnancies to term where the fetus might have a disability once born. \n\nNeumeier is best known for advocacy against coercive and forced treatment, including advocacy to close the Judge Rotenberg Center, an institution for people with developmental disabilities known for use of electric skin shock aversive treatment.\n\nNeumeier is best known for advocacy against coercive and forced treatment, including advocacy to close the Judge Rotenberg Center, an institution for people with developmental disabilities known for use of electric skin shock aversive treatment. The Judge Rotenberg Center has been a major issue of contention in the autism rights movement, with many neurodiversity and disability rights organizations condemning the electric skin shock aversive treatment as inhumane, while its supporters, who may be parents, former residents, or clinicians, believe that the treatments are beneficial and life-saving. In 2012, Neumeier attended a medical malpractice trial against the Judge Rotenberg Center brought by former resident Andre McCollins, who received 31 shocks over a period of six hours. Neumeier published a series of seven articles for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network about the trial testimony, including an account of the first instance that video of the electric skin shocks was made available for public viewing. Neumeier also testified at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's 2014 public hearing on a proposal to ban electric shock treatments for behavioral modification of people with developmental disabilities. In 2016, Neumeier published an op-ed in USA Today calling for a final ban on the electric shock aversives. Neumeier opposes use of electric skin shock aversive treatment as a form of torture, and believes its use is connected to the behavioral modification goals of applied behavior analysis, a widely used form of early intervention treatment for autism. \n\nWhile a law student, Neumeier authored a pamphlet on the use of restraint and seclusion on special education students in Massachusetts public schools, as an intern for the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee. After graduating from Smith College and Suffolk University Law School, Neumeier worked on youth rights policy issues for the Community Alliance for the Ethical Treatment of Youth. Neumeier represented CAFETY at an industry conference of children's and youth behavioral modification residential treatment programs hosted by the American Association of Children’s Residential Centers, at which Neumeier advocated against the use of what they described as \"fear-based marketing techniques\" advertising quick fixes for challenging behavior and for more stringent regulations on treatment programs for youth. In December 2013, upon invitation by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Neumeier joined CAFETY's Executive Director Kathryn Whitehead for an expert consultation meeting hosted at the Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment in health-care settings with international human rights organizations, and delivered a presentation on systemic patterns of abuses in youth residential treatment programs, which CAFETY refers to as the troubled teen industry.\n\nLater as an attorney, Neumeier worked for Disability Rights New York, a statewide protection and advocacy agency for people with disabilities, before going into solo practice in Massachusetts. Neumeier is also an adviser for Supported Decision-Making New York, a statewide coalition focused on development of best practices and policies to enable people with intellectual disabilities and cognitive impairments to increase individual autonomy while receiving support for complex decision-making processes, such as financial, medical, or services eligibility issues. Neumeier is also an adviser and New England Region Leader for the Intersex and Genderqueer Recognition Project, a transgender rights legal and advocacy organization that works to secure legal recognition of nonbinary gender identities, such as through gender-neutral sex or gender markers on government-issued identification. \n\nAs an advocate in the neurodiversity and transgender rights movements, Neumeier has spoken at conferences including the annual Rebellious Lawyering Conference at Yale Law School, Creating Change, the Autism National Committee, Brandeis University's DEIS Impact Roundtable for Social Justice, the inaugural Disability Intersectionality Summit in Boston, and the Georgetown University Lecture and Performance Series on Disability Justice.

Specifically, they proved, by examining the decay of K-mesons, that a reaction run in reverse does not retrace the path of the original reaction, which showed that the reactions of subatomic particles are not indifferent to time. Thus the phenomenon of CP violation was discovered. This demolished the faith that physicists had that natural laws were governed by symmetry.\n\nBorn on a cattle ranch near Merriman, Nebraska, Fitch was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II, and worked on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. He later graduated from McGill University, and completed his Ph.D. in physics in 1954 at Columbia University. He was a member of the faculty at Princeton University from 1954 until his retirement in 2005.\n\nVal Logsdon Fitch was born on a cattle ranch near Merriman, Nebraska, on March 10, 1923, the youngest of three children of Fred Fitch, a cattle rancher, and his wife Frances née Logsdon, a school teacher. He had an older brother and sister. The family farm was about in size, and was about from the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre. The ranch was a small one; his father specialized in raising breeding stock. Soon after his birth, his father was badly injured in a horse riding accident and could no longer work on his ranch, so the family moved to the nearby town of Gordon, Nebraska, where his father entered the insurance business. It was here that he attended school, graduating from Gordon High School in 1940 as valedictorian.\n\nFitch attended Chadron State College for three years, then transferred to Northwestern University; but this was during World War II, and his studies were interrupted by being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1943. After he had completed basic training, the Army sent him to Carnegie Institute of Technology for training under the Army Specialized Training Program. Under this program, some 200,000 soldiers attended colleges for intensive courses. Fitch was in the program for less than a year before the manpower requirements of the war became too great, and the Army terminated the program. Most of the soldiers in the ASTP were posted to combat units, but Fitch was one of a hundred or so ASTP soldiers who joined the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), which provided much-needed technicians to the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe Army sent Fitch to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. By mid-1944, about a third of the technicians at Los Alamos were from the SED. While there, he met many of the greats of physics including Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Enrico Fermi, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Bruno Rossi, Emilio Segrè, Edward Teller and Richard C. Tolman, in some cases attending courses on physics taught by them. He worked in the group headed by Ernest Titterton, a member of the British Mission, and became well-acquainted with the techniques of experimental physics. He participated in the drop testing of mock atomic bombs that was conducted at Wendover Army Air Field and the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station, and worked at the Trinity site, where he witnessed the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945. He was discharged from the Army in 1946, but continued to work at Los Alamos as a civilian for another year in order to earn some money. He would briefly return to Los Alamos in summer 1948.\n\nHis wartime experiences led Fitch to decide to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, the head of the physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and there was no evidence that they existed, but it made a good thesis topic.\n\nFitch designed and built an experiment to measure the gamma rays emitted from mu-mesic atoms. As it turned out, this was a good time to search for them. Columbia had recently commissioned a cyclotron at the Nevis Laboratories that could produce muons; Robert Hofstadter had developed the thallium-activated sodium iodide gamma ray detector; and wartime advances in electronics yielded advances in components such as new phototubes needed to bring it all together. Initially nothing was found, but Rainwater suggested expanding the search beyond the energy range predicted by Wheeler on the basis of the then-accepted size of the radius of the atomic nucleus as around 1.4 × 10 m. When this was done, they found what they had been looking for, discovering in the process that the nucleus was closer to 1.2 × 10 m. He completed his Ph.D. in 1954, writing his thesis on \"Studies of X-rays from mu-mesonic atoms\". The thesis was published in the \"Physical Review\" in November 1953.\n\nIn 1949, Fitch married Elise Cunningham, a secretary who worked in the laboratory at Columbia. They had two sons. Elise died in 1972, and in 1976 he married Daisy Harper Sharp, thereby acquiring two stepdaughters and a stepson. After obtaining his doctorate, Fitch's interest shifted to strange particles and K mesons. He took a position at Princeton University, where he spent the rest of his career. He became a professor in 1960, Fogg Brackett Professor in 1976, and McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Physics in 1987, retaining this position until his retirement in 2005. He was chair of the Physics Department from 1976 to 1981.\n\nFitch conducted much of his research at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he became acquainted with James Cronin. The two of them played bridge at nights while they waited for the Cosmotron to become available. Cronin had built a new kind of detector, a spark chamber spectrometer, and Fitch realized that it would be perfect for experiments with K mesons (now known as kaons), which Yale University physicist Robert Adair had suggested had interesting properties worth investigating. They could decay into either matter or antimatter. Along with two colleagues, James Christenson and René Turlay, they set up their experiment on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven. They discovered an unexpected result. The decay of neutral K mesons did not respect CP symmetry. K mesons that decayed into positrons did so faster than those that decayed into electrons. The importance of this result was not immediately appreciated; but as evidence of the Big Bang accumulated, Andrei Sakharov realized in 1967 that it explained why the universe is largely made of matter and not antimatter. Put simply, they had found \"the answer to the physicist's 'Why do we exist?'\" For this discovery, Fitch and Cronin received the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, Fitch received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1968, the John Price Wetherill Medal in 1976 and the National Medal of Science in 1993. He was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" and the JASON defense advisory group. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1966. In 1981, Fitch became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. He was president of the American Physical Society from 1988 to 1989, and he served on a number of governmental science and science policy committees, including the President's Science Advisory Committee from 1970 to 1973. He died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 91 on February 5, 2015.\n\n\n"}

After graduation he studied chemistry at the Technische Hochschule zu Breslau (now Wrocław University of Technology). Due to his excellent work he was exempt from study fees as of the third semester.\n\nIn summer semester of 1931 he passed the preliminary examination with excellence. In winter semester 1933 he passed all 7 diploma exams with the highest possible grade A and he became Dipl.-Ing. (chem.). In 1934 his thesis “Über die Addition von Verbindungen mit stark polarer Kohlenstoff-Halogenbindung an ungesättigte Kohlen-Wasserstoffe“ received the highest possible honor (summa cum laude). He became Dr.-Ing. (chem.). His doctorate was confirmed on November 8, 1934 in Breslau (source: Walter Thiel’s doctorate).\n\nThiel's Professor in Breslau recommended Thiel to the Research Institute of the German army ordnance office of under-secretary Prof. Karl Erich Schumann at the University of Berlin. Thiel’s previous findings had technological applicability and therefore he was able to continue his fundamental research in a leading position. Late 1934 or early 1935 Thiel became research instructor at Reichswehrministerium. Schumann accompanied many diploma theses and dissertations, including that of Wernher von Braun, who completed his dissertation in 1934. The contacts between the testing ground in Kummersdorf and Schumann’s Institute was close, the eastern part of the site in Kummersdorf served as an experimental base for Schumann’s institutes, in the west a group of scientists around Major Walter Dornberger carried out their experiments. Here Thiel got to know Walter Dornberger and Wernher von Braun.\n\nIn autumn of 1936 Dornberger asked Thiel to move from fundamental research to Wa Prüf 11 at Kummersdorf’s western testing ground. All topics regarding the engine were assigned to Thiel, and he had to further advance the propulsion, which he managed in a very short time. In his paper “Empirische und theoretische Grundlagen zur Neuberechnung von Öfen und Versuchsdaten, Schießplatz Kummersdorf Vers. West“, that he presented on April 27, 1937, Thiel introduces developments that lead to decisive changes, including a shortening of the oven and an optimization of the injection nozzle. Furthermore, Thiel continued to research different fuel mixtures for the rocket engines.\n\nIn 1937 the first scientists moved from Kummersdorf to Peenemünde. As the test stations were not ready yet, Thiel and his team stayed in Kummersdorf until 1940. After transferring from Kummersdorf to the Peenemünde Army Research Center in the summer of 1940, Thiel became deputy director of the Peenemünde HVP Organization under von Braun. In 1940 many new scientists were recruited in order to speed up the R&D of the A4. Chemist Gerhard Heller became a very important co-worker of Thiel. They also established private contacts. Other colleagues of Thiel at the development unit included: Hermann M. Bedürftig, Konrad Dannenberg, Werner Dobrick, Hans Fichtner, Werner Gengelbach, Hans J. Lindenmayr, Dr. William A. Mrazek, Kurt E. Patt, Gerhard H. Reisig, Walther J. Riedel (Riedel III), Ludwig Roth, Helmut Zoike. After the war, these scientists and others were recruited into United States-government service as part of Operation Paperclip.\n\nIn the A4 project, the first successful launch occurred from test station VII on October 3, 1942. The rocket flew 190 km in the targeted direction and it reached a height of 85 km. The top-speed was 1,322 m/s. As the A4 was now showing military qualities, the NS leadership was demanding immediate implementation in war. Mass production replaced science, although the whole unit was still immature. There were many launch failures after October 3, 1942. In 1943 Thiel and many fellow scientists and researchers were very exhausted and unhappy in Peenemünde. Work overload, pressure to succeed and the changeover from a research unit to a production facility started to take its toll on the scientists. Thiel refused to declare the rocket engine ready for mass production. In a letter to von Braun, sent during a trip to a health farm, Thiel described the Aggregat 4: “…where it is more of a complicated lab product than a mass item….”. Thiel formulated his protest by handing in his resignation orally on August 17, 1943. He planned to get his professorship at a university. Dornberger rejected his resignation.\n\nDuring the following night from August 17 to August 18, 1943 the Royal Air Force launched a bombing raid of Peenemünde, Operation \"Hydra\". The Thiel family died in a slit trench in front of their home in Karlshagen. It is very likely that a bomb hit the slit trench directly. Thiel and his family (wife Martha, daughter Sigrid and son Siegfried) were buried at the war cemetery in Karlshagen. Martin Schilling replaced Thiel.\n\nOn 29 October 1944, Thiel was posthumously awarded the Knight's Cross of the War Merit Cross with Swords.\n\nThiel’s accomplishments were not forgotten. In 1970 a moon crater is named after him. It is located on the far side of the moon and thus not visible from earth. (Coordinates: 40° 42’ N / 134° 30’ W, mean diameter: 32.0 km). In addition, Thiel was one of the first pioneers to be inducted in the “Space Hall of Fame” in Alamogordo, New Mexico, USA in 1976.\n\nBased on the film cooling ('veil cooling') solution identified by colleague Moritz Pöhlmann at Peenemünde, Thiel designed annular rings of tiny perforations to inject unburnt fuel through the chamber walls at the throat for evaporative cooling to prevent V-2 rocket nozzle erosion.\n\nBy September 15, 1941, Thiel officially declared the basic eighteen-pot design of the A-4 motor finished.\n\nEarlier in the Spring of 1941, Thiel began investigating nitric acid and diesel oil to be used as the fuel for the 30-ton-thrust A-8 .\n\nThen on December 18, 1941, Thiel documented the initial A-9/A-10 motor design of six combustion chambers into one common nozzle in Secret Command Document 1496/41.\n\nBy the middle of August 1943, Dr Thiel declared that the A-4 developmental problems preclude mass production, recommended the project be abandoned.\n\nThiel also designed the motor for the Wasserfall anti-aircraft missile.\n"}
{"id": "6609618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6609618", "title": "Winamac", "text": "Winamac\n\nWinamac was the name of a number of Potawatomi leaders and warriors beginning in the late 17th century. The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between New France and the natives of the Lake Michigan region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant \"Catfish\" in his native Eastern Algonquian language, was soon transformed into \"Winamac\", which means the same thing in the Potawatomi language. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg.\n\nThe Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the St. Joseph River in what is now the U.S. state of Michigan. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the Fox Wars in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the War of 1812. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.\n\nIn 1681, a group of Native Americans from several Algonquian tribes of New England accompanied French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle on an expedition to the west. One of these Natives, Wilamet (or Ouilamette or Wilamek), was appointed by La Salle to serve as a laison between New France and the natives of the Lake Michigan region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant \"Catfish\" in his native Eastern Algonquian language, was eventually transformed into \"Winamac\", which means the same thing in the Potawatomi language. Before long, he was recognized by the French as the \"chief\" of the Potawatomi villages along the St. Joseph River in what is now the U.S. state of Michigan.\n\nWilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or \"okama\"), but was instead a \"chief\" appointed by the French. French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the Franco-Indian alliance. According to historian Richard White, \"as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief\".\n\nWilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering Iroquois influence in the Lake Michigan region. In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under Cadillac against the Iroquois. In 1701, Wilamet and Onanghisse (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief, represented the Potawatomis at the great Treaty of Montreal, which ended the war with the Iroquois.\n\nDuring the Fox Wars (1712–1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis. Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of Sauk and Meskwaki (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe. In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace. The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.\n\nDuring the War of 1812 era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other. American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the \"anti-American\" or \"hostile\" Winamek and the \"pro-American\" or \"friendly\" Winamek.\n\nThe \"anti-American\" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the Osages, Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor Ninian Edwards demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief Gomo informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to Prophetstown in Indiana, headquarters of the anti-American resistance movement led by the Shawnee Prophet and his brother Tecumseh. Along with chiefs Shabbona and Waubonsie, Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the Battle of Tippecanoe at Prophetstown in 1811.\n\nWinamac began the organization for the 1812 siege of Fort Wayne. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio. What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce. Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort. Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander. Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended.\n\nAfter the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent Matthew Elliott. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan (Spemica Lawba), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.\n\nThe \"pro-American\" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash. Beginning in 1807 he and Five Medals and Topinabee continued to ask the American government for agricultural help. The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people. In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land. A council was called at Fort Wayne in September. Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession. When were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi. Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands. The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio. Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing. Winamac provide information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown. Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison. Here, Tecumseh denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.\n\nThrough the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois. To end the destruction, councils where held at Cahokia and Vincennes. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the Shawnee spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors. When Gov. Harrison marched north to Prophetstown on the Tippecanoe in November 1811, Winamac marched with him. When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet. Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by. On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day. When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops. The Potawatomi were led by Shabbona with Waubansee and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi). The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages. The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements. Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements. His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm.\n\nWhen the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements. He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived. On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan. Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died. Fort Dearborn fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16.\n\nIn September 1817, Winamac and Metea represented the eastern Potawatomis at the treaty of Fort Meigs, in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States. Winamac died in 1821.\n\n\n"}
