Crabiel, who was a Pennsylvania Railroad official and was a member of the Milltown Board of Education and Borough Council. His family settled in Milltown in 1852 and his brother, parents, and grandfather also held in community offices. He was married to Jean Evelyn Rasmussen and later to Mary Varga and had five children.\n\nHe was drafted in 1951, and was stationed in Alaska with the Army Medical Corps during the Korean War. He was discharged with the rank of Corporal in October 1953. In a 1999 commencement address at Middlesex County College, Crabiel noted that he flunked out of Rutgers.

He married Rachel, the daughter of Rabbi Masoud Tsabbach, and one of their children was Rabbi Rafael Aharon. A talented leader and a distinguished scholar, Ben Shimon attracted a large following at an early age. In 1854, at the age of twenty eight, he moved to Jerusalem together with several of his disciples, and he quickly became a leading figure within the Moroccan Jewish community.\n\nIn Jerusalem, his learning, his wisdom and his charisma attracted increasing numbers of followers. He established the Tzuf Dvash Synagogue in 1860, and participated in the establishment of Mishkenot Shaananim. Relations with the Sephardi community, which ruled Jerusalem, became strained, as he felt they tried to master him. He decided to establish a community of his own, \"Edah HaMaaravit B'Yerushalayim\". Together with his followers, he settled in 1867 on a lot he had purchased outside the walls of the Old City, Mahane Israel. Two synagogues, several Batei Medrash (houses of study), and other institutions were built there. His Moroccan followers were soon followed by Jews from other North African countries, who wished to brake away from the Sephardi yoke. The community was the first to brake off from the direct supervision of the Sephardic umbrella organization \"Ha'Edah HaSfaradit B'Yerushalayim\".\n\nHe sent meshulachs (fundraisers for charity in the Holy land) to Jewish communities in Islamic countries, and used the money to aid the needy, as well as to build the institutions of his community. He opened a meat store where he would distribute meat to the poor, and he took care of widows and orphans. He reported all donations and expenses in a newsletter called \"Havatzelet\".\n\nBen Shimon served as Rosh Yeshiva, rabbi and posek, and gave halachic rulings in his Beth Din. His reputation drew crowds from outside his community to hear him and study with him. The first six years, he was the leader at large for his community; thereafter he appointed a committee of seven rabbis who would assist him in leading the community. Sir Moses Montefiore also greatly assisted the community.\n\nBen Shimon planned a series of books about the holy land by the name of \"Shaarei Tzedek\". In 1862 he published the first volume, \"Shaar Hachatzer\" a collection of commentaries of the Sages regarding the Holy Land, supplemented with his own commentaries. The second volume was published posthumously: \"Shaar Hamatarah\" on the laws of the land. The third book, \"Shaar Hakadim,\" with introductions about matters pertaining to Eretz Yisrael, was never printed. \"Shaar Hamifkad\" on the special traditions of the land was edited by the author's son Rabbi Rafael Aharon and was published in Egypt in 1908. \"Shaar Takdim\" is about the commandments of the land and \"Shaarei Tehilah\" contains prayers and songs for special occasions. Rabbi David's responsa were included in a book by his son named \"Umitzur Devash.\" The divorce cases in which Rabbi David was involved are summarized in the book \"Shem Chadash,\" by his youngest son Rabbi Masoud. This book also includes the poetry written by Rabbi David, under the name \"Shir Chadash.\"\n"}

He is one half of a Los Angeles gay couple who have been together since meeting in high school in 1978. Don's initial desire to marry his high school sweetheart made headlines in a 1995 \"Los Angeles Times\" article when the couple expressed their desire to hop on a plane to Hawaii and then seek to enforce their marriage rights in California. The Times article was one of the first that documented the rise of Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA a year later. In 2008 \"The Advocate\" featured Norte's marriage to his spouse during the Summer of Love in 2008. Norte and his spouse were both Log Cabin Republicans during the campaign for marriage equality.\n\nDon Norte is credited with being one of the first openly gay Republican appointees to a governing body, when California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed him to the Governor's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. The Governor's Committee is charged with developing a comprehensive strategy to assist disabled youth and adults to enter the workforce by focusing on the needs and interests of the worker, the employer, and the community. Don's appointed position did not require Senate confirmation and the position does not receive a salary. Norte's term does not expire but he serves at the will of the Governor of California. That Governor is now Jerry Brown. Norte was the first Log Cabin Republican to remain an appointee under Democratic Governor Jerry Brown's administration.\n\nIn 2004, Norte was involved in the Bobby Shriver for Santa Monica City Council Campaign and was one of about 10 named prominent community leader endorsers in Shriver's campaign literature.\n\nNorte's career covers over twenty years of public service with Federal, State, and local government, including the US Defense Department and the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.\n\nNorte holds a BA from Montclair State University in New Jersey, and master's degree from New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, where he studied under Professor Rae Zimmerman, among others. Don served on the Board of Directors and later as President of the California Public Parking Association. Don was employed by the City of West Hollywood's Department of Transportation and Public Works as Parking Services and Projects Officer for 27 years, and currently serves as Parking Manager for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Norte currently resides in Hollywood with his partner since high school, and now husband, Kevin.\n\nIn 2009, Norte was named the Program Chair of CPPAs 25th Annual Conference and secured San Francisco Assemblyperson Fiona Ma as the Keynote Speaker.\n\nIn 2010, both Norte and his spouse were co-hosts at a fundraiser for Democratic San Francisco Assembly person and Speaker Pro Tempore Fiona Ma for Fiona Ma's planned bid for the California Senate in 2014 (since then Ma was elected to the California State Board of Equalization representing the Second District.\n\nLog Cabin Republicans (LCR) joined with the Schwarzenegger administration to actively recruit LGBT representatives in Sacramento.\n\nThe inclusion of the LGBT community was significant in that the positions were launching points for both Republicans and Democrats. Log Cabin California Director James Vaughn made recruitment from LCR a top priority, and succeeded in recruiting the first openly gay Republican to serve on a visible political post in the Schwarzenegger administration.\n\n\"This is part of our campaign to develop a farm team of candidates for public office â€“ getting our members to be involved on state and local boards and commissions.\"Don and his spouse were the only same sex couple to publicly endorse the Republican Schwarzenegger and were involved in the inauguration as a same sex couple in the program brochure The Nortes were sponsors of Log Cabin Republicans/Liberty Education Forum in Denver in 2007 and in San Diego in 2008 according to both program's booklets. The slightly right of center couple was also a table sponsor for Equality California's Gala Dinner in Los Angeles in the summer of 2008.\n\nAccording to a recent blog by Huffington Post blogger Ryan J. Davis, Davis flew out to Hollywood near the end of February to join a coalition of gay activists to lobby Gov. Schwarzenegger & First Lady Maria Shriver to publicly oppose the Family Research Council's Anti-Gay Marriage initiative. According to Davis, Norte's spouse, who was the organizer of the evening, wrote on The California Log Cabin blog, \"Someone had to fire the first shot. We did. We had some powerhouses there and the message was clear. We were not going away.\"\n\nAs reported in The Huffington Post, the coalition had a broad base, including Matt Foreman (former Executive Director, The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force), Damon Romine (Former Entertainment Media Director, GLAAD), Geoff Kors (Former Executive Director, Equality California), Charles Robbins (Executive Director, The Trevor Project), John Duran (President, Equality California & City Councilperson West Hollywood), Charles Moran, the Log Cabin Republicans' former LA Chapter President and LCR-CA VP, 2010, James Vaughn (former LCR CA Director), and the organizers, Don Norte (Governor's Committee on Labor for People With Disabilities) and Kevin Norte (LCR California Member, and former LCR-PAC Board of Directors).\n\nOn April 11, 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger officially announced his opposition to the Initiative at LCR's National Convention. At Log Cabin's 2009 convention, Kevin Norte received the group's \"Grassroots Leader Award\". In May 2010, the couple represented LCR at the Long Beach Gay & Lesbian Pride Festival.\n\nNorte tested California's \"Domestic Partnership\" law that promised equality except for the word \"marriage\" in 2005 by attempting to change his last name to test the applicability of AB 205. That law was intended to match the rights of domestic partnerships to married couples.\n\nThe language provided in California Family Code § 297.5 (a), reads as follows:Registered domestic partners shall have the same rights, duties, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether derived from statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, government policies, common law, or any other provisions or sources of law, as are granted to and imposed upon spouses.\n\nDuring the Legislative Session 2006-07, California AB 102 was drafted by San Francisco Assemblymember Fiona Ma after the Norte's legal name status was called into question after the CA DMV adopted a policy to intentionally block other domestic partners after the Nortes from applying the California Family Code in a similar manner. The Nortes' involvement was mentioned in the description of a George Takei interview on Larry King.\n\nAB 102 expanded on the concept of allowing domestic partners to take the name of a spouse, to include married couples so the husband would have the right to assume the last name of the wife. AB 102 was inclusive and consistent with Fam. Code § 297.5 by addressing marriages of different or the same genders. Name changes processed for domestic partners after AB 205 and prior to AB 102 originally permitted individuals to proceed with subsequent name change actions, including social security and passport documents. AB 102 passed the Assembly with three Republican votes: Sam Blakeslee, Roger Niello, and Anthony Adams. It passed the Senate on a straight party vote.\n\nThe reaction from opponents was swift after the Governor signed the bill. \"AB 102 allows homosexual couples to hold themselves out as married by permitting them to choose the same surname upon registration of their 'domestic partnership,'\" said Randy Thomasson, president of Campaign for Children and Families. The bill granted unmarried couples married last names. \"Schwarzenegger and the Democrat politicians have created the public image of homosexual \"marriages\" in California,\" said Thomasson in response to the signing of AB 102. \"It's hypocritical for Arnold Schwarzenegger to veto homosexual \"'marriage'\" licenses and at the very same time aggressively promote the public image of gay and lesbian \"'marriages'\" in every community for every child to see.\" Nortes' position on their name was resolved in the 2006-07 legislative session when AB 102 was signed into law by the Governor because the law was made retroactive.\n\nDuring the last days of the 2012 Presidential election, when Log Cabin Republicans announced their last minute endorsement of Mitt Romney, Norte and his husband resigned from Log Cabin Republicans and changed their political affiliation.\n\n\n"}

Many of his non-fiction books and articles popularized scientific ideas and discoveries or reported on medical advances. In the 1930s and 1940s, many of his articles appeared in popular magazines in Canada and the United States and three of his books were published by large commercial publishers in the United States and widely reviewed.\n\nHe occasionally used the pseudonym Warren Desmond for popular fiction that he would otherwise would not have been able to sell in the United States due to McCarthyism.\n\nCarter was born in Saint John, New Brunswick to Gertrude and William R. Carter, members of the Salvation Army who had been sent from Britain first to Bermuda and then to Canada to work for the church. In 1912, the Carters became matron and superintendent, respectively, of the Provincial Detention Home for Juveniles in Winnipeg, where Dyson Carter would grow up and go to school. Carter suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta, which made his bones brittle throughout his life and often required him to be bedridden or walk with crutches, or later use a wheelchair.\n\nCarter received his Bachelor of Science in 1931 and his Master of Science degree in Chemistry from the University of Manitoba in 1933 and subsequently worked as a university lecturer, a researcher and an engineering consultant in addition to his writing career.\n\nCarter wrote in a number of genres including popular science, health, socialist realist fiction, romance, and biography.\n\nHis works included \"Sea of Destiny: the Story of Hudson Bay, Our Undefended Back Door\" (1940), a book that argued the Canadian north was susceptible to Nazi invasion and should be developed and militarized along the lines of the Soviet north in order to prevent such an eventuality, \"Night of Flame\" (1942), a novel set in a hospital that explored themes of class conflict, and \"Stalin's Life\" (1943), a hagiographical biography of Stalin.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Carter's articles were published in popular magazines such as \"Saturday Night\", \"Star Weekly\", and \"Maclean's\" and in various American publications such as the pulp magazine \"Argosy\" and was made a member of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society in 1941, but was essentially blacklisted by the popular media after 1945 when he made public his membership in the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communist Party of Canada was known at the time). He had joined the Communist Party in 1931 but had kept his membership secret for over a decade.\n\nMany of his books were translated into Russian and other languages and distributed throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries, and many of his articles were translated and carried in Soviet publications.\n\nAs well as being president of the CSFSS from 1949 to 1960, with Dorise Nielsen as executive secretary, and engaging in national lecture tours to promote friendship with the Soviet Union, Carter was editor and publisher of the Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society's newsletter, \" News-Facts About the USSR\" from 1950 to 1956 and of the glossy pro-Soviet magazine \"Northern Neighbours\" from 1956 to 1989.\n\nCarter's pro-Soviet writings never deviated from the party line, following its twists and turns. The invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 were presented from the Soviet point of view. According to historian Jennifer Anderson, who researched Carter's life and work:\n\n\"Dyson Carter eventually recognized the message did not correspond with reality, but not until Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost had made speaking openly about Soviet 'falsifications' possible. In 1990, Carter wrote that he had spent 40 years producing 'bullshit.'\"\n\nCarter added: \"I publicized so many Soviet ‘achievements’that were total falsifications, that I consider my ‘work’ an exercise in political pathology.\"\n\nHe was awarded several honours by the Soviet Union including the Centenary Medal (1970), the Order of Friendship of the Peoples (1980) and the Order of the Union of Friendship Societies (1985).\n"}

Howe was the author of one of the first books that was critical of the spiritual claims of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. His 1834 book \"Mormonism Unvailed\" was based largely on affidavits collected by Latter Day Saint dissenter Doctor Philastus Hurlbut and on the letters of dissenter Ezra Booth, which in 1831 had been published in the \"Ohio Star\".\n\nHowe was born to Samuel William Howe and Mabel Dudley in Clifton Park, Saratoga County, New York. In 1804 the family moved to Ovid, New York and 1811 relocated to Upper Canada, living a few miles west of Niagara Falls. During the War of 1812 Howe joined the U.S. Army in Batavia, New York. After the war, Howe became involved in the newspaper business, working at the \"Buffalo Gazette\" in Buffalo, New York, the \"Erie Gazette\" in Erie, Pennsylvania, and the \"Cleveland Herald\" in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1822, he moved to Painesville, Ohio and began publishing the \"Painesville Telegraph\". Under Howe's editorship, the \"Telegraph\" had a strongly abolitionist editorial perspective. Howe's home was used as a station on the Underground Railroad, assisting fugitive slaves. In June 1823 he married Sophia Hull of Clarence, Ohio.\n\nWhile living in Painesville, Howe's wife, sister, and niece converted to Mormonism. On January 11, 1831, Howe wrote a letter to W. W. Phelps, a newspaper publisher in Canandaigua, New York, asking about the origins of the new religion. Phelps, who had read the Book of Mormon and met Joseph Smith, responded to Howe by writing that \"we have nothing by which we can positively detect it as an imposition\", but that \"if it is false, it will fall, and if of God, God will sustain it.\" Phelps was baptized into the Latter Day Saint church a few months later. Howe continued to be interested in the Mormons, and in November 1834 he published \"Mormonism Unvailed\", which he described as \"a history of the Mormon imposition, from its rise to the present time, with many other peculiarities of the sect.\"\n\nIn January 1835, Howe sold the \"Painesville Telegraph\" to his younger brother for $600. After leaving the newspaper, Howe remained a publisher and a manufacturer of woollen goods.\n\nHowe considered himself to be a skeptic on religious matters. However, after his wife died of stomach cancer in 1866, he became an avid believer in spiritualism.\n\n\n"}

He came to concentrate on Italian, and was elected to the Chair of Italian at Cambridge in 1933.\n\nEdward Bullough was born in Thun, Switzerland, on 28 March 1880, to John Bullough and Bertha Schmidlein. As a child he lived mostly in Germany, and was educated at Vitzthum Gymnasium, Dresden. At seventeen Bullough moved to England, and in 1899 matriculated from Trinity College in the University of Cambridge, where he studied Medieval and Modern Languages. He graduated BA (Class I) in 1902, MA in 1906, after which he taught French and German at Cambridge colleges and lectured in the university.\n\nAt this time Bullough became interested in aesthetics, and \"prepared himself to deal with [its] problems … by a study of physiology and general psychology\". In 1907 Bullough gave a course of lectures in aesthetics, the first such at Cambridge, privately printed as \"The Modern Conception of Aesthetics\". He repeated the course annually \"until shortly before his death\". Bullough conducted experimental work on the perception of colours in the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory, the basis for a series of three papers in the \"British Journal of Psychology\": \"The Apparent Heaviness of Colours\" (1907), \"The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Single Colours\" (1908), and \"The 'Perceptive Problem' in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Simple Colour-Combinations\" (1910). Bullough also had an interest in parapsychology, and was a member of the Society for Psychical Research.\n\nIn 1908 Bullough married Enrichetta Angelica Marchetti (daughter of the actor Eleonora Duse), with whom he would have a son and a daughter. He was elected to a Drosier Fellowship at Gonville and Caius College in 1912, and in the same year published his noted theoretical paper, Psychical Distance' as a Factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle\". Psychical distance (Bullough capitalises the words) is that which, in certain situations, \"appears to lie between our own self and its affections, using the latter term in its broadest sense as anything which affects our being\". Artistic production and appreciation are two such situations.[Psychical Distance] has a \"negative\", inhibitory aspect—the cutting-out of the practical sides of things and of our practical attitude to them—and a \"positive\" side—the elaboration of the experience on the new basis created by the inhibitory action of Distance.\n\nThe relation between self and object remains a personal one (it is not like the impersonal relation in scientific observation, for example) and Bullough thinks that a \"concordance\" between them is necessary for aesthetic appreciation. However this must not be such that psychical distance is lost: Bullough imagines a jealous husband watching a performance of \"Othello\", who \"will probably do anything but appreciate the play\". This \"antinomy of Distance\" leads Bullough to say that what is desirable in art, \"both in appreciation and production\", is \"the utmost decrease of Distance without its disappearance\".\n\nIn the First World War, Bullough was recruited as a civilian in the summer of 1915 to the Admiralty's cryptoanalysis section, Room 40. He served for four years, finally as a Lieutenant of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. After the war he returned to Caius, where he had been re-elected to a fellowship in January 1915. He published in the \"British Journal of Psychology\" two more papers on aesthetic theory, \"The Relation of Aesthetics to Psychology\" (1919) and \"Mind and Medium in Art\" (1920), and a review of experimental work (1921). In 1920, he was appointed College Lecturer in modern languages and University Lecturer in German, and he edited the anthology \"Cambridge Readings in Italian Literature\".\n\nIn 1923 Bullough resigned his university post, wishing to concentrate instead on Italian. The same year, he joined the Roman Catholic Church as a Dominican Tertiary, and afterwards was active in the Cambridge University Catholic Association. In the following decade he published translations of Étienne Gilson, Karl Adam, and Achille Ratti (by then Pope Pius XI), and gave three papers on Dante at Catholic summer schools in Cambridge and Salzburg. A colleague believed that his work in Italian studies \"all went into his lectures and teaching\", rather than research for publication. He was appointed University Lecturer in Italian in 1926.\n\nBullough was elected to the Chair of Italian at Cambridge in March 1933. In his printed inaugural lecture, titled \"Italian Perspectives\", he claims that the Italian \"perspective\" is one of \"continuity of classical with medieval and modern times\", so that tradition is treated \"with the easy familiarity of a family possession\". He argues that because the European classical tradition is also, for the Italian, the native tradition, \"the 'national' inheritance of Italy lies at the same time embedded in the foundations of Europe\". In illustration, Bullough proposes Roman law, the Renaissance, and the Romantic movement as \"three contributions made by Italy to the patrimony of the civilised world\". He offers the contemporary fascist movement as a tentative fourth: a successor to the chair, Uberto Limentani, believed there was \"no doubt\" that Bullough sympathised with fascism.\n\nAfter a short illness resulting from an internal operation, Bullough died in a nursing home in Bath on 17 September 1934. He was buried at Woodchester Priory in Stroud. The philosopher Michael Oakeshott, a colleague at Caius, wrote Bullough's obituary for their college record.\n\nThe family home on Buckingham Road, Cambridge was offered to the Dominican Order by his widow and is now Cambridge Blackfriars.\n\nNote that Bullough's texts and translations of other authors are collected after the chronological presentation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "68392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68392", "title": "Harry Flashman", "text": "Harry Flashman\n\nSir Harry Paget Flashman is a fictional character created by Thomas Hughes (1822–1896) in the semi-autobiographical \"Tom Brown's School Days\" (1857) and later developed by George MacDonald Fraser (1925–2008). Harry Flashman appears in a series of 12 of Fraser's books, collectively known as \"The Flashman Papers\", with covers illustrated by Arthur Barbosa. Flashman was played by Malcolm McDowell in the Richard Lester 1975 film \"Royal Flash\".\n\nIn Hughes' 1857 book, Flashman (a relatively minor character) is portrayed as a notorious bully at Rugby School who persecutes Tom Brown, and who is finally expelled for drunkenness. Fraser decided to write Flashman's memoirs, in which the school bully would be identified with an \"illustrious Victorian soldier\" experiencing many 19th-century wars and adventures and rising to high rank in the British Army, acclaimed as a great soldier, while remaining \"a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward—and, oh yes, a toady.\" Fraser's Flashman is an antihero who often runs from danger in the novels. Nevertheless, through a combination of luck and cunning, he usually ends each volume acclaimed as a hero.\n\nFraser gave Flashman a lifespan from 1822 to 1915 and a birth-date of 5 May. Flashman's first and middle names were invented for the character as Hughes's novel does not give Flashman's first name. Fraser uses the names to make an ironic allusion to Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, one of the heroes of Waterloo, who cuckolded the Duke of Wellington's brother Henry Wellesley and later—in one of the period's more celebrated scandals—married Wellesley's ex-wife.\n\nIn \"Flashman\", Flashman says that his great-grandfather, Jack Flashman, made the family fortune in America, trading in rum, slaves and \"piracy too, I shouldn't wonder\". Despite their wealth, the Flashmans \"were never the thing\": Flashman quotes the diarist Henry Greville's comment that \"the coarse streak showed through, generation after generation, like dung beneath a rosebush\". Harry Flashman's father, Henry Buckley Flashman, appears in \"Black Ajax\" (1997). Buckley, a bold young officer in the British cavalry, was wounded in action at Talavera in 1809. He then tried to get into \"society\" by sponsoring bare-knuckle boxer Tom Molineaux (the first black man to contend for a championship) and subsequently married Flashman's mother Lady Alicia Paget, a fictional relation of the real Marquess of Anglesey. Buckley also served as a Member of Parliament but was \"sent to the knacker's yard at Reform\". Beside politics, his interests were drinking, fox hunting (riding to hounds) and women.\n\nFlashman is a large man, tall and close to 13 stone (about 180 pounds or 82 kg). In \"Flashman and the Tiger\", he mentions that one of his grandchildren has black hair and eyes, resembling him in his younger years. His dark colouring frequently enabled him to pass (in disguise) for a Pashtun. He claims only three natural talents: horsemanship, facility with foreign languages, and fornication. He becomes an expert cricket-bowler, but only through hard effort (he needed sporting credit at Rugby School, and feared to play rugby football). He can also display a winning personality when he wants to, and is very skilled at flattering those more important than himself without appearing servile.\n\nAs he admits in the Papers, Flashman is a coward, who will flee from danger if there was any way to do so, and has on some occasions collapsed in funk. He has one great advantage in concealing this weakness: when he is frightened, his face turns red, rather than white, so that observers think he is excited, enraged, or exuberant—as a hero ought to be.\n\nAfter his expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness, the young Flashman looks for an easy life. He has his wealthy father buy him an officer's commission in the fashionable 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons. The 11th, commanded by Lord Cardigan, later involved in the Charge of the Light Brigade, has just returned from India and are not likely to be posted abroad soon. Flashman throws himself into the social life that the 11th offered and becomes a leading light of Canterbury society. In 1840 the regiment is converted to Hussars with an elegant blue and crimson uniform, which assists Flashman in attracting female attention for the remainder of his military career.\n\nA duel with another officer over a French courtesan leads to his being temporarily stationed in Paisley, Scotland. There he meets and deflowers Elspeth Morrison, daughter of a wealthy textile manufacturer, whom he has to marry in a \"shotgun wedding\" under threat of a horsewhipping by her uncle. But marriage to the daughter of a mere businessman forces his transferral from the snobbish 11th Hussars. He is sent to India to make a career in the army of the East India Company. Unfortunately, his language talent and his habit of flattery bring him to the attention of the Governor-General. The Governor does him the (very much unwanted) favour of assigning him as aide to General Elphinstone in Afghanistan. Flashman survives the ensuing debacle by a mixture of sheer luck and unstinting cowardice. He becomes an unwitting hero: the defender of Piper's Fort, where he is the only surviving white man, and is found by the relieving troops clutching the flag and surrounded by enemy dead. Of course, Flashman had arrived at the Fort by accident, collapsed in terror rather than fighting, been forced to stand and show fight by his subordinate, and is 'rumbled' for a complete coward. He had been trying to surrender the colours, not defend them. Happily for him, all inconvenient witnesses had been killed.\n\nThis incident sets the tone for Flashman's life. Over the following 60 years or so, he is involved in many of the major military conflicts of the 19th century — always in spite of his best efforts to evade his duty. He is often selected for especially dangerous jobs because of his heroic reputation. He meets many famous people, and survives some of the worst military disasters (the First Anglo-Afghan War, Charge of the Light Brigade, the Siege of Cawnpore, Battle of the Little Bighorn, Battle of Isandlwana), always coming out with more heroic laurels. The date of his last adventures seems to have been around 1900. He dies in 1915.\n\nDespite his admitted cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting when he has to. Though he dodges danger as much as he can, and runs away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides all the way to the Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and to do anything else would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.\n\nFlashman surrenders to fear in front of witnesses only a few times, and is never caught out again. During the siege of Piper's Fort, in the first novel, Flashman cowers weeping in his bed at the start of the final assault; the only witness to this dies before relief comes. He breaks down while accompanying Rajah Brooke during a battle with pirates, but the noise drowns out his blubbering, and he recovers enough to command a storming party of sailors (placing himself right in the middle of the party, to avoid stray bullets). After the Charge of the Light Brigade, he flees in panic from the fighting in the battery—but mistakenly charges into an entire Russian regiment, adding to his heroic image.\n\nIn spite of his numerous character flaws, Flashman is represented as being a perceptive observer of his times (\"I saw further than most in some ways\"). In its obituary of George MacDonald Fraser, \"The Economist\" commented that realistic sharp-sightedness (\"if not much else\") was an attribute Flashman shared with his creator.\n\nFlashman, an insatiable lecher, had sex with many different women over the course of his fictional adventures. His size, good looks, winning manner, and especially his splendid cavalry-style whiskers won over many women, from low to high, including many famous women, and frequent encounters with prostitutes. In \"Flashman and the Great Game\", about halfway through his life, he counted up his sexual conquests while languishing in a dungeon at Gwalior, \"not counting return engagements\", reaching a total of 478 up to that date. Passages in \"Royal Flash\", \"Flashman and the Dragon\", \"Flashman and the Redskins\", and \"Flashman and the Angel of the Lord\" suggest that Flashman was well endowed. \n\nHe was a vigorous and exciting (if sometimes selfish and rapacious) lover, and some of his partners became quite fond of him—though by his own admission, others tried to kill him afterwards. The most memorable of these was Cleonie, a prostitute Flashman sold into slavery in \"Flashman and the Redskins\". He was not above forcing himself on a partner by blackmail (e.g., the Russian countess in \"Flashman and the Dragon\"), and at least twice raped women (Narreeman, an Afghan dancing girl in \"Flashman\", and an unnamed harem girl in \"Flashman's Lady\"). \n\nFlashman's stories are dominated by his numerous amorous encounters. Several of them are with prominent historical personages. These women are sometimes window dressing, sometimes pivotal characters in the unpredictable twists and turns of the books. Historical women Flashman bedded included:\n\n\nHe also lusted after (but never bedded):\n\n\nHis fictional amours included:\n\n\nAs well as bedding more or less any lass available, he married whenever it was politic to do so. During a posting to Scotland, he was forced to marry Elspeth to avoid \"pistols for two with her fire-breathing uncle\". He is still married to her decades later when writing the memoirs, though that does not stop him pursuing others. Nor does it prevent marrying them when his safety seems to require it; he marries Duchess Irma in \"Royal Flash\" and in \"Flashman and the Redskins\" he marries Susie Willnick as they escape New Orleans and Sonsee-Array a few months later.\n\nHe was also once reminded of a woman that Elspeth claimed he flirted with named Kitty Stevens, though Flashman was unable to remember her.\n\nHe had a special penchant for royal ladies, and noted that his favourite amours (apart from his wife) were Lakshmibai, Ci Xi and Lola Montez: \"a Queen, an Empress, and the foremost courtesan of her time: I dare say I'm just a snob.\" He also noted that, while civilized women were more than ordinarily partial to him, his most ardent admirers were among the savage of the species: \"Elspeth, of course, is Scottish.\" And for all his raking, it was always Elspeth to whom he returned and who remained ultimately top of the list.\n\nHis lechery was so strong that it broke out even in the midst of rather hectic circumstances. While accompanying Thomas Kavanaugh on his daring escape from Lucknow, he paused for a quick rattle with a local prostitute, and during the battle of Patusan, he found himself galloping one of Sharif Sahib's concubines without even realizing it but nonetheless continued to the climax of the battle and the tryst.\n\nFlashman's relations with the highest-ranking woman of his era, Queen Victoria, are warm but platonic. He first meets her in 1842 when he receives a medal for his gallantry in Afghanistan and reflects on what a honeymoon she and Prince Albert must have enjoyed. Subsequently he and his wife received invitations to Balmoral Castle, to the delight of the snobbish Elspeth. For his services during the Indian Mutiny, Victoria not only approved awarding Flashy the Victoria Cross, but loaded the KCB on top of it.\n\nIn 1975, Malcolm McDowell played Harry Flashman in \"Royal Flash\", directed by Richard Lester.\n\n\n"}

The Scheibs wandered as refugees during the First World War. In 1918, in Lvov, young Scheib witnessed a funeral procession for Jews murdered in a pogrom.\nAfter high school, Scheib enrolled at the Rabbinical Seminary of Vienna for religious studies and the University of Vienna for secular studies. He completed his doctorate on \"The Voluntarism of Eduard von Hartmann, Based on Schopenhauer,\" but never took his rabbinical exams at the seminary.\n\nMeanwhile, he attended, with his father, a protest demonstration in front of the local British Consulate following the 1929 Arab riots in Palestine. The next year he read a poem by Uri Zvi Greenberg, \"I'll Tell It to a Child,\" about a messiah who cannot redeem his people because they are not ready to accept redemption. Two or three years later, Scheib met Greenberg at a speech Greenberg was giving entitled “The Land of Israel Is in Flames.”\n\nScheib's first job after graduation was high school teaching in Volkovisk. He also published articles in Revisionist Zionist journals and became the commander of a local Betar section.\nScheib joined the staff of the Teachers Seminary in Vilna in 1937 while this city was part of Poland, where he stayed for two years. During that time he rose in the Betar ranks to the position of regional staff officer. In 1938, at the Third Betar Conference in Warsaw, when the Revisionist leader Zeev Jabotinsky attacked the militant stance of Poland's Betar leader Menachem Begin, Scheib spoke in Begin's defense. The next year, when the Second World War broke out, Scheib and Begin escaped together from Warsaw. Begin was arrested by the Soviet police in the middle of a chess game with Scheib, and it was several years before they met again in British Mandatory Palestine, where Scheib was already a leader of the Lehi underground and Begin would soon command the Irgun. The Lehi was at that point waging a violent struggle for freedom from British rule and the Irgun would, under Begin, soon join the revolt in hopes of turning Palestine into a Jewish state.\n\nScheib adopted several aliases while living underground, including \"Sambatyon\" and \"Eldad\". He worked in 1942 directly with Lehi founder Avraham Stern. After Stern's killing by the British, Eldad became one of a triumvirate of Lehi commanders, serving with Natan Yellin-Mor and future prime minister Yitzhak Shamir. It was in this role that, in September 1948, Eldad participated in ordering the assassination of Folke Bernadotte, a United Nations mediator, as he subsequently admitted. Yellin-Mor was the diplomatic \"foreign minister,\" Shamir the operations man, and Eldad the ideologue. For the next six years Eldad wrote articles for various underground newspapers, some of which he edited. Eldad also wrote some of the speeches delivered in court by Lehi defendants.\n\nEldad was arrested by the British fleeing from a Tel Aviv apartment; he was injured in a fall from a water pipe, and imprisoned in the Jerusalem prison in a body cast. He continued his political and philosophical writing from Cell 18 of the hospital ward at the Jerusalem Central Prison. Eventually Eldad healed enough to escape while on a visit in a dentist's clinic, from which several Lehi fighters spirited him away.\n\nDuring Israel's War of Independence, Eldad was critical of Menachem Begin's Irgun for what he thought of not fighting against the Israel Defence Forces during the Altalena Affair . He was also critical of the IDF for not fighting harder to conquer Jerusalem's Old City and critical of Lehi fighters who did not rush to fight in Jerusalem. Towards the end of the war, Eldad disguised himself as a foreign journalist in order to sneak past Israeli military roadblocks and join the battle for Jerusalem.\nThe Lehi veterans organized politically as the Fighters' List. The party won one seat in the election for the First Knesset and dissolved afterwards. At one party meeting, Eldad lectured on \"Sulam\", Jacob's ladder (based on , where Jacob dreams of a ladder uniting heaven and earth), thus beginning the next chapter in his life. For 14 years he published a revolutionary journal, \"Sulam\". Eldad also spent half of 1949 writing his memoirs, entitled \"Maaser Rishon\".\n\nEldad eventually got a job teaching Bible and Hebrew literature in an Israeli high school, until Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion intervened and had him dismissed. Ben-Gurion was afraid Eldad would imbue the students with his Lehi ideology. Eldad went to court and won, but found few people willing to hire him after Ben-Gurion had labeled him a danger to the state. Eldad turned to literary work, wrote histories of underground battles, a biography of the mayor of Ramat Gan, a newspaper-style review of Jewish history called \"Chronicles\", a book of Bible commentary, \"Hegionot Mikra\", weekly newspaper columns, and many more books, encyclopedia entries and other works. In 1962, Eldad was made a lecturer at the Technion in Haifa. He taught there for twenty years. Since 1982 was a lecturer at the Ariel University Center of Samaria. In 1988, Eldad was awarded Tel Aviv's Bialik Prize for his contributions to Israeli thought.\n\nBy the 1990s, Eldad was known as the doyen of Israeli nationalists. He died on the first day of the Hebrew month of Shevat, in January 1996. His funeral was attended by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former prime minister Yitzhak Shamir and Knesset Speaker Dov Shilansky. Eldad was buried on the Mount of Olives, at the foot of the grave of his mentor and friend, Uri Zvi Greenberg.\n\nEldad did not believe that the creation of the state of Israel was the goal of Zionism. He considered the state a tool to be used in realizing the goal of Zionism, which he called \"Malkhut Yisrael\" (the Kingdom of Israel). Eldad sought what he referred to as national redemption, meaning a sovereign Jewish kingdom in the biblical borders of Israel, with all the world's Jews living there, and the Jewish Temple rebuilt in Jerusalem. Eldad steadfastly refused to give legitimacy to any Jewish presence in the Diaspora, which he felt was doomed to extinction. Nonetheless, in his view of history, past generations of Jews in exile from the Land of Israel were not denigrated as passive sufferers, but were considered creative players in history. Eldad and his journal \"Sulam\" wrote frequently about Jewish political figures who throughout history tried to bring redemption to their people, but who were stymied by geopolitical or other obstacles.\nEldad called on all Jews to join in the building of Israel, not for their personal fulfillment but because they are needed there.\n\nPolitically, Eldad favored an independent foreign policy, with Israel not a member of any foreign bloc. He advocated more forceful use of the Israel Defense Forces and opposed the inclusion of the word \"defense\" in the name of the army. He opposed ceding any land to the Arabs.\n\nMuch of Eldad's voluminous writings has been translated into English, mostly by Zev Golan. Among his works: \"Chronicles\" . \"The Jewish Revolution\" appeared in 1971, and was reissued in 2007. \"Free Jerusalem\" includes a chapter by Eldad (\"Meanwhile, A European Interlude\") about Polish Jewry on the eve of war. \"Israel: The Road to Full Redemption\", a translation of an article in \"Sulam\", was published in 1961 and is today a virtually unobtainable brochure. A website is devoted to disseminating articles by Eldad and his underground colleagues. His memoirs of the time he led the Lehi underground organisation, \"The First Tithe\", were translated and first published in 2008. \"God, Man and Nietzsche\" includes a lengthy examination of Eldad's philosophy of history and excerpts from an article about Nietzsche written by Eldad in the underground. \"Stern: The Man and His Gang\" has a biography of Eldad and a detailed comparison of his political ideas and goals with those of other Lehi leaders.\n\n\nMany of Eldad's political and philosophical teachings continue to be espoused by the Magshimey Herut (achievers of liberty) organization, the Zionist Freedom Alliance, and by the Hatikva political party, the latter one led by Eldad's son Aryeh. The Israeli settlement Kfar Eldad was named after him.\n\n\n\n"}

She would eventually marry Sir Walter St John, a distant relative. Throughout her life, St John constructed two recipe books containing culinary, cosmetic, and medicinal recipes. She was the grandmother to the first Viscount Bolingbroke, Henry St John.\n\nSt John's father was Oliver St John, a leading Parliamentarian and supporter of Oliver Cromwell. She was raised during the time of the English Civil War. In the early months of her life, her mother, Johanna Altham, brought her to the home of Altham's stepfather, Sir William Masham, in High Laver, Essex. St John was baptized there on January 27, 1631.\n\nIn 1649, she married her distant cousin and later had thirteen children.\n\nLydiard Park is a 260-acre country park at Lydiard Tregoze, nearly four miles west of central Swindon, Wiltshire, England, later owned by the Viscount of Bolingbroke, Johanna St John's grandson. A set of letters between Johanna St John and her steward, Thomas Hardyman, give insight into how she learned to construct her recipe books. At Lydiard House, her summer estate, a plethora of materials and ingredients including food, herbs, and livestock gave her the raw materials she needed to craft her recipe books. St John's usage of these materials ranged from food to distilled medicines. From the letters, there is an understanding that Johanna herself did not concoct the recipes at Lydiard House, but gave \"exact details to a team of distillers and herbgatherers\", often collaborating with other recipe-makers in London. People she collaborated with included Sir Edward Spencer, Lady Manchester and Lady Peterborough who all had remedies for sore eyes, and Sr. Philip Warwick who had a remedy for cramps.\n\nBanister's powder does not have a clear intended purpose or use. However, the first three ingredients: unicorn horn, bezoar stone, and bones of stag heart indicate that the intended use was to treat poison. This recipe is significant because it shows how the Early Modern Period still accepted the idea of magic in their remedies.\n\nWhile many of St John's recipes were prepared to cure ailments, some of her recipes were meant to be cosmetic. In her recipe \"To Make Hands White\", she used a concoction of herbs and seeds to cleanse her hands and make them white. This was important to a woman of status who hosted parties.\n"}
{"id": "31377387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31377387", "title": "John Ward (prophet)", "text": "John Ward (prophet)\n\nJohn Ward (25 December 1781 – 12 March 1837), known as Zion Ward, was an Irish preacher, mystic and self-styled prophet, active (in the latter capacity) in England from around 1828 to 1835. He was one of those claiming to be the successor of prophetess Joanna Southcott after her death. His imprisonment for blasphemy prompted the intervention of Member of Parliament Joseph Hume.\n\nWard was born at the Cove of Cork (now Cobh), in County Cork, Ireland, on 25 December 1781. In July 1790, his parents took him to Bristol, England, where, at twelve years of age, he was apprenticed to a shipwright. His father took him to London in 1797, where he learned shoemaking from his brother, but soon went back to his former trade and served on board the man-of-war \"Blanche\" as a shipwright; in this capacity he saw action at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801.\n\nIn 1803, Ward was paid off from the Navy at Sheerness, Kent. He married and returned to the trade of shoemaker. Ward had been brought up a Calvinist, but became a Methodist at his wife's insistence, after moving to Carmarthen in Wales. Unable to experience conversion, he returned to London, resolving to \"never more have anything to do with religion\". However, after hearing dissenter Jeremiah Learnoult Garrett preach at Lant Street Chapel in Southwark, he joined the Baptists. On Garrett's death in 1806, he aligned himself with the independents, and in 1813, joined the Sandemanians, becoming a village preacher.\n\nJust after the death of prophetess Joanna Southcott in 1814, Ward came across her \"Fifth Book of Wonders\". Its universalism captivated him, and he began to preach it. This led to him rejoining the Methodists, who made him a local preacher, but soon dismissed him for his heretical views. The Southcottians would not receive him either.\n\nConvinced by the example of Joanna Southcott that prophecy was \"a living gift\", Ward looked for another prophet to guide him, falling in with Mary Boon of Staverton, Devon. Boon was a Seventh-day Sabbatarian fanatic who claimed to be Joanna Southcott reborn. Ward became the \"reader\" of the letters she dictated (for she could neither read nor write), for the benefit of her London followers. Around 1825, Ward began to experience visions in which he was supposedly visited by Southcott in spirit form. His followers reckoned their years from this point, designating 1826 \"First year, new date\".\n\nIn 1827, Ward gave up shoemaking to proclaim his divine call; his wife and family were convinced that he was mad, and he was reported to the parish officers. He was brought before a Southwark magistrate (Chambers), declared insane, and committed to Newington Workhouse for six months. He continued to experience visions, claiming to have received instruction and a sense of \"call and mission\". Upon being freed, on 20 November 1828, he claimed to be \"a new man, having a new name\", \"Zion\". He also called himself \"Shiloh\", as he was convinced that he was the biblical messiah of that name, to whom Southcott had claimed she would give birth.\n\nIn 1829, with the help of a follower, Charles William Twort (d. 1878, aged 93), he began to print tracts. He visited and preached in various towns and cities in England, making converts in Nottingham, Chesterfield, Worksop, Blyth, Barnsley, Birmingham, and Sheffield. In 1831, he preached regularly at Borough Chapel in Southwark (London), and in September, attracted notice for two discourses at the Rotunda on Blackfriars Road, previously made notorious by the preaching of Robert Taylor (1784–1844).\n\nIn 1832, Ward and Twort came into conflict with the authorities at Derby. They had posted placards announcing an address on a religious fast day, 15 July. These were torn down three times by a local clergyman, James Dean (d. 1882), whom Twort assaulted. Ward and Twort were subsequently indicted for blasphemy and assault. Tried on 4 August before Sir James Alan Park, Twort was convicted of the assault, and both were found guilty of blasphemy, and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment in Derby Gaol. The case had already become something of a \"cause célèbre\", attracting the attention of the radical Richard Carlile, amongst others. On 15 August, Henry Hunt, another political radical and agitator, presented a petition to the House of Commons from 200 citizens of London, expressing \"disgust and indignation\" at the sentence, and praying for the release of Ward and Twort. Hunt made a violent attack on the government for prosecuting opinions; Member of Parliament Joseph Hume spoke in favour of the petition, and the Attorney General opposed. On Hunt's motion, the house was counted out while Alexander Perceval was speaking. No mitigation of the sentence was obtained, but the confinement, as Ward described it, was by no means harsh.\n\nFreed on 3 February 1834, Ward travelled to Bristol and preached to a congregation there. At the end of 1835 he had a paralytic stroke. On October 1836, he settled in Leeds. He died at 91 Park Lane, Leeds, on 12 March 1837.\n\nThough said to be of \"gentle disposition\" and \"modest demeanour\", Ward was a persuasive speaker, and in conversation and writing, was able to argue with some authority and even humour. His attempts at verse are uncouth, but often effective. His main influence was Joanna Southcott and her school, but he was also familiar with the ideas of George Fox (1624–1691) and Lodowicke Muggleton (1609–1698); however, most of his teaching came from his own considerations on the Bible. He regarded biblical scripture as allegorical, and elaborated a key for eliciting its hidden meanings. His theology is a spiritual pantheism, which allows immortality only to the regenerate.\n\nWard's printed works include over thirty pieces, among which are:\n\nIn 1874, a \"jubilee\" edition of his works was planned, with the title \"Writings of Zion Ward, or Shiloh, the Spiritual Man\", but only three parts were actually published (Birmingham, 1874–5). However, some additional tracts were printed separately, e.g. \"Good and Evil made One\" (1877).\n\n"}
{"id": "16422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16422", "title": "Joni Mitchell", "text": "Joni Mitchell\n\nRoberta Joan Mitchell, CC (née Anderson; born November 7, 1943), professionally known as Joni Mitchell, is a Canadian singer-songwriter. Drawing from folk, pop, rock, and jazz, Mitchell's songs often reflect social and environmental ideals as well as her feelings about romance, confusion, disillusionment, and joy. She has received many accolades, including nine Grammy Awards. \"Rolling Stone\" called her \"one of the greatest songwriters ever\", and AllMusic has stated, \"When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century\".\n\nMitchell began singing in small nightclubs in her hometown of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and throughout western Canada, before busking in the streets and nightclubs of Toronto, Ontario. In 1965, she moved to the United States and began touring. Some of her original songs (\"Urge for Going\", \"Chelsea Morning\", \"Both Sides, Now\", \"The Circle Game\") were covered by other folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, \"Song to a Seagull\", in 1968. Settling in Southern California, Mitchell, with popular songs like \"Big Yellow Taxi\" and \"Woodstock\", helped define an era and a generation. Her 1971 album \"Blue\" is often cited as one of the best albums of all time; it was rated the 30th best album ever made in \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", the highest entry by a female artist. In 2000, \"The New York Times\" chose \"Blue\" as one of the 25 albums that represented \"turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music\". In 2017, NPR ranked \"Blue\" Number 1 on a list of Greatest Albums Made By Women.\n\nMitchell's fifth album, \"For the Roses\", was released in 1972. She then switched labels and began exploring more jazz-influenced melodic ideas, by way of lush pop textures, on 1974's \"Court and Spark\", which featured the radio hits \"Help Me\" and \"Free Man in Paris\" and became her best-selling album.\n\nAround 1975, Mitchell's vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to more of a wide-ranging contralto. Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she explored jazz, melding it with influences of rock and roll, R&B, classical music and non-western beats. In the late 1970s, she began working closely with noted jazz musicians, among them Jaco Pastorius, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, as well as Charles Mingus, who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings. She later turned again toward pop, embraced electronic music, and engaged in political protest. In 2002, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nMitchell is the sole producer credited on most of her albums, including all her work in the 1970s. A blunt critic of the music industry, she quit touring and released her 17th, and reportedly last, album of original songs in 2007. With roots in visual art, Mitchell has designed most of her own album covers. She describes herself as a \"painter derailed by circumstance\".\n\nMitchell was born Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, Canada, the daughter of Myrtle Marguerite (McKee) and William Andrew Anderson. Her mother's ancestors were Scottish and Irish; her father was from a Norwegian family that possibly had some Sami ancestry. Her mother was a teacher while her father was a Royal Canadian Air Force flight lieutenant who instructed new pilots at RCAF Station Fort Macleod. She later moved with her parents to various bases in western Canada. After the war she settled with her family in Saskatchewan. She later sang about her small-town upbringing in several of her songs, including \"Song for Sharon\".\n\nAt school Mitchell struggled; her main interest was painting. During this time she briefly studied classical piano.\n\nAt age nine, Mitchell contracted polio in an epidemic, and was hospitalised for weeks. Following this incident she focused on her creative talent, and considered a singing or dancing career for the first time. By nine, she was a smoker; she denies claims that smoking has affected her voice. At 11, she moved with her family to the city of Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown. She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook. One unconventional teacher did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry, and her first album includes a dedication to him. In Grade 12, she dropped out (she later picked up her studies) and hung out downtown with a rowdy set until deciding that she was getting too close to the criminal world.\n\nAt this time, country music began to eclipse rock, and Mitchell wanted to play the guitar. As her mother disapproved of its hillbilly associations, she settled initially for the ukulele. Eventually she taught herself guitar from a Pete Seeger songbook, but the polio had affected her fingers, and she had to devise dozens of alternative tunings of her own. This improvised approach later helped her break free of standard approaches to harmony and structure in her songwriting.\n\nMitchell started singing with her friends at bonfires around Waskesiu Lake, northwest of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Her first paid performance was on October 31, 1962, at a Saskatoon club that featured folk and jazz performers. At 18, she widened her repertoire to include her own favorite performers like Édith Piaf and Miles Davis. Though she never performed jazz herself in those days, she and her friends sought out gigs by jazz musicians. Mitchell said, \"My jazz background began with one of the early Lambert, Hendricks and Ross albums.\" That album, \"The Hottest New Group in Jazz\", was hard to find in Canada, she says. \"So I saved up and bought it at a bootleg price. I considered that album to be my Beatles. I learned every song off of it, and I don't think there is another album anywhere—including my own—on which I know every note and word of every song.\"\n\nBut art was still her chief passion at this stage, and when she finished high school at Aden Bowman Collegiate in Saskatoon, she took art classes at the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate with abstract expressionist painter Henry Bonli, and then left home to attend the Alberta College of Art in Calgary for the 1963–64 school year. Here she felt disillusioned about the high priority given to technical skill over free-class creativity, and also felt out of step with the trend towards pure abstraction, and the tendency to move into commercial art. After a year, at age 20, she dropped out of school, a decision that much displeased her parents, who could remember the Great Depression and valued education highly.\n\nShe continued to play gigs as a folk musician on weekends, at her college and at a local hotel. Around this time she took a $15-a-week job in a Calgary coffeehouse, \"singing long tragic songs in a minor key\". She sang at hootenannies and made appearances on some local TV and radio shows in Calgary. In 1964, at the age of 20, she told her mother that she intended to be a folk singer in Toronto, and she left western Canada for the first time in her life, heading east for Ontario. On the three-day train ride there, Mitchell wrote her first song, \"Day After Day\". She stopped at the Mariposa Folk Festival to see Buffy Sainte-Marie, a Saskatchewan-born Cree folk singer who had inspired her. A year later, Mitchell too played Mariposa, her first gig for a major audience, and years later, Sainte-Marie herself covered Mitchell's work.\n\nLacking the $200 needed for musicians' union fees, Mitchell managed a few gigs at the Half Beat and the Village Corner in Toronto's Yorkville neighbourhood, but she mostly played non-union gigs \"in church basements and YMCA meeting halls\". Rejected from major folk clubs, she resorted to busking, while she \"worked in the women's wear section of a downtown department store to pay the rent.\" During this era, she lived in a rooming house, directly across the hall from poet Duke Redbird. Without a lot of name recognition, Mitchell also began to realize each city's folk scene tended to accord veteran performers the exclusive right to play their signature songs—despite not having written the songs—which Mitchell found insular, contrary to the egalitarian ideal of folk music. She found her best traditional material was already other singers' property and would no longer pass muster. She said, \"You'd come into a town and you'd be told, you can't sing that, you can't sing that.\" She resolved to write her own songs.\n\nIn late 1964, Mitchell discovered that she was pregnant by her Calgary ex-boyfriend Brad MacMath. She later wrote, \"[he] left me three months pregnant in an attic room with no money and winter coming on and only a fireplace for heat. The spindles of the banister were gap-toothed fuel for last winter's occupants.\" At the time, \"the pill\" was legally unavailable in Canada, as was abortion, yet there was a strong social stigma against women giving birth out of wedlock. In Toronto, she could at least do so quietly, without alarming her relatives back home. In February 1965 she gave birth to a baby girl. Unable to provide for the baby, she placed her daughter, Kelly Dale Anderson, for adoption. The experience remained private for most of her career, but she made allusions to it in several songs, for example \"Little Green,\" which she performed in the 1960s and recorded eventually for the 1971 album \"Blue\".\n\nIn \"Chinese Cafe\", from the 1982 album \"Wild Things Run Fast\", Mitchell sang, \"Your kids are coming up straight / My child's a stranger / I bore her / But I could not raise her.\" These lyrics did not receive wide attention at the time. The existence of Mitchell's daughter was not publicly known until 1993, when a roommate from Mitchell's art-school days in the 1960s sold the story of the adoption to a tabloid magazine. By that time, Mitchell's daughter, renamed Kilauren Gibb, had already begun a search for her biological parents. Mitchell and her daughter met in 1997. After the reunion, Mitchell said that she lost interest in songwriting, and she later identified her daughter's birth and her inability to take care of her as the moment when her songwriting inspiration had really begun. When she could not express herself to the person she wanted to talk to, she became attuned to the whole world and she began to write personally.\n\nA few weeks after the birth of her daughter in 1965, Joni Anderson was playing gigs again around Yorkville, beginning to sing original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met Chuck Mitchell, an American folk singer from Michigan. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States. In one interview, Mitchell claimed she married Chuck only 36 hours after they met, but it is unclear if they were ever married in Toronto. Sometime in late April, Joni left Canada for the first time, going with Chuck to the US, where the two began playing music together. Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, \"I made my dress and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money... I walked down the aisle brandishing my daisies.\"\n\nWhile living at the Verona apartments in Detroit's Cass Corridor, Chuck and Joni were regular performers at area coffee houses, including the Chessmate on Livernois, near Six Mile Road; the Alcove bar, near Wayne State University; the Rathskeller, a restaurant on the campus of the University of Detroit; and the Raven Gallery in Southfield. She began playing and composing songs in alternative guitar tunings taught to her by a fellow musician, Eric Andersen, in Detroit. Oscar Brand featured her several times on his CBC television program \"Let's Sing Out\" in 1965 and 1966. The marriage and partnership of Joni and Chuck Mitchell dissolved in early 1967, and Joni moved to New York City to follow her musical path as a solo artist. She played venues up and down the East Coast, including Philadelphia, Boston, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She performed frequently in coffeehouses and folk clubs and, by this time creating her own material, became well known for her unique songwriting and her innovative guitar style.\n\nFolk singer Tom Rush had met Mitchell in Toronto and was impressed with her songwriting ability. He took \"Urge for Going\" to the popular folk artist Judy Collins, but she was not interested in the song at the time, so Rush recorded it himself. Country singer George Hamilton IV heard Rush performing it and recorded a hit country version. Other artists who recorded Mitchell's songs in the early years were Buffy Sainte-Marie (\"The Circle Game\"), Dave Van Ronk (\"Both Sides Now\"), and eventually Judy Collins (\"Both Sides Now\", a top ten hit for her, and \"Michael from Mountains\", both included on her 1967 album \"Wildflowers\"). Collins also covered \"Chelsea Morning\", another recording that eclipsed Mitchell's own commercial success early on.\n\nWhile Mitchell was playing one night in the Gaslight South, a club in Coconut Grove, Florida, David Crosby walked in and was immediately struck by her ability and her appeal as an artist. He took her back to Los Angeles, where he set about introducing her and her music to his friends. Soon she was being managed by Elliot Roberts, who, after being urged by Buffy Sainte-Marie, had first seen her play in a Greenwich Village coffee house. He had a close business association with David Geffen. Roberts and Geffen were to have important influences on her career. Crosby convinced a record company to let Mitchell record a solo acoustic album without the folk-rock overdubs in vogue at that time, and his clout earned him a producer's credit in March 1968, when Reprise Records released her debut album, known either as \"Joni Mitchell\" or \"Song to a Seagull\".\n\nMitchell toured steadily to promote the LP. The tour helped create eager anticipation for Mitchell's second LP, \"Clouds\", which was released in April 1969. This album contained Mitchell's own versions of some of her songs already recorded and performed by other artists: \"Chelsea Morning\", \"Both Sides, Now\", and \"Tin Angel\". The covers of both LPs, including a self-portrait on \"Clouds\", were designed and painted by Mitchell, a blending of her painting and music that she continued throughout her career.\n\nIn March 1970, \"Clouds\" produced her first Grammy Award for Best Folk Performance. The following month, Reprise released her third album, \"Ladies of the Canyon\". Mitchell's sound was already beginning to expand beyond the confines of acoustic folk music and toward pop and rock, with more overdubs, percussion, and backing vocals, and for the first time, many songs composed on piano, which became a hallmark of Mitchell's style in her most popular era. Her own version of \"Woodstock\", slower than the cover by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, was performed solo on a Wurlitzer electric piano. The album also included the already-familiar song \"The Circle Game\" and the environmental anthem \"Big Yellow Taxi\", with its now-famous line, \"they paved paradise and put up a parking lot.\"\n\n\"Ladies of the Canyon\" was an instant smash on FM radio and sold briskly, eventually becoming Mitchell's first gold album (selling over a half million copies). She made a decision to stop touring for a year and just write and paint, yet she was still voted \"Top Female Performer\" for 1970 by \"Melody Maker\", a leading UK pop music magazine. On the April 1971 release of James Taylor's \"Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon\" album, Mitchell is credited with backup vocals on the track \"You've Got a Friend\". The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience appeared on her next album, \"Blue\", released in June 1971. Comparing Joni Mitchell's talent to his own, David Crosby said, \"By the time she did \"Blue\", she was past me and rushing toward the horizon\".\n\n\"Blue\" was an almost instant critical and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 in the Billboard Album Charts in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced \"Carey\" was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of \"Blue\" departed further from the sounds of \"Ladies of the Canyon\". Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell's voice and emotions (\"All I Want\", \"A Case of You\"), while others such as \"Blue\", \"River\" and \"The Last Time I Saw Richard\" were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most confessional album, Mitchell later said of \"Blue\", \"I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup, ... singing 'I'm selfish and I'm sad', for instance. We all suffer for our loneliness, but at the time of \"Blue\", our pop stars never admitted these things.\" In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in \"California\"). Mitchell later remarked, \"At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong.\"\n\nMitchell decided to return to the live stage after the great success of \"Blue\", and she presented new songs on tour which appeared on her next album, her fifth, \"For the Roses\". The album was released in October 1972 and immediately zoomed up the charts. She followed with the single, \"You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio\", which peaked at No. 25 in the Billboard Charts in February 1973, becoming her first bona fide hit single.\n\n\"Court and Spark\", released in January 1974, saw Mitchell begin the flirtation with jazz and jazz fusion that marked her experimental period ahead. \"Court and Spark\" went to No. 1 on the Cashbox Album Charts. The LP made Mitchell a widely popular act for perhaps the only time in her career, on the strength of popular tracks such as the rocker \"Raised on Robbery\", which was released right before Christmas 1973, and \"Help Me\", which was released in March of the following year, and became Mitchell's only Top 10 single when it peaked at No. 7 in the first week of June. \"Free Man in Paris\" was another hit single and staple in her catalog.\n\nWhile recording \"Court and Spark\", Mitchell had tried to make a clean break with her earlier folk sound, producing the album herself and employing jazz/pop fusion band the L.A. Express as what she called her first real backing group. In February 1974, her tour with the L.A. Express began, and they received rave notices as they traveled across the United States and Canada during the next two months. A series of shows at L.A.'s Universal Amphitheater on August 14–17 were recorded for a live album. In November, Mitchell released that album, \"Miles of Aisles\", a two-record set including all but two songs from the L.A. concerts (one selection each from the Berkeley Community Theatre, on March 2, and the L.A. Music Center, on March 4, were also included in the set). The live album slowly moved up to No. 2, matching \"Court and Spark\"s chart peak on Billboard. \"Big Yellow Taxi\", the live version, was also released as a single and did reasonably well (she released another version of the song in 2007).\n\nIn January 1975, \"Court and Spark\" received four nominations for Grammy Awards, including Grammy Award for Album of the Year, for which Mitchell was the only woman nominated. She won only the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals.\n\nMitchell went into the studio in early 1975 to record acoustic demos of some songs that she had written since the \"Court and Spark\" tour. A few months later she recorded versions of the tunes with her band. Her musical interests were now diverging from both the folk and the pop scene of the era, toward less structured, more jazz-inspired pieces, with a wider range of instruments. The new song cycle was released in November 1975 as \"The Hissing of Summer Lawns\". On \"The Jungle Line\", she made an early effort at sampling a recording of African musicians, something that became more commonplace among Western rock acts in the 1980s. \"In France They Kiss on Main Street\" continued the lush pop sounds of \"Court and Spark\", and efforts such as the title song and \"Edith and the Kingpin\" chronicled the underbelly of suburban lives in Southern California.\n\nDuring 1975, Mitchell also participated in several concerts in the Rolling Thunder Revue tours featuring Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, and in 1976 she performed as part of \"The Last Waltz\" by the Band. In January 1976, Mitchell received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the album \"The Hissing of Summer Lawns\", though the Grammy went to Linda Ronstadt.\n\nIn early 1976, Mitchell traveled with friends who were driving cross country to Maine. Afterwards, she drove back to California alone and composed several songs during her journey which featured on her next album, 1976's \"Hejira\". She stated that \"This album was written mostly while I was traveling in the car. That's why there were no piano songs ...\" \"Hejira\" was arguably Mitchell's most experimental album so far, due to her ongoing collaborations with jazz virtuoso bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius on several songs, namely the first single, \"Coyote\", the atmospheric \"Hejira\", the disorienting, guitar-heavy \"Black Crow\", and the album's last song \"Refuge of the Roads\". The album climbed to No. 13 on the Billboard Charts, reaching gold status three weeks after release, and received airplay from album oriented FM rock stations. Yet \"Coyote\", backed with \"Blue Motel Room\", failed to chart on the Hot 100. \"Hejira\" \"did not sell as briskly as Mitchell's earlier, more \"radio-friendly\" albums, [but] its stature in her catalogue has grown over the years\". Mitchell herself believes the album to be unique. In 2006 she said, \"I suppose a lot of people could have written a lot of my other songs, but I feel the songs on \"Hejira\" could only have come from me.\"\n\nIn mid-1977, Mitchell began work on new recordings that became her first double studio album. Close to completing her contract with Asylum Records, Mitchell felt that this album could be looser in feel than any album she'd done in the past. She invited Pastorius back, and he brought with him fellow members of jazz fusion pioneers Weather Report, including drummer Don Alias and saxophonist Wayne Shorter. Layered, atmospheric compositions such as \"Overture/Cotton Avenue\" featured more improvisatory collaboration, while \"Paprika Plains\" was a 16-minute epic that stretched the boundaries of pop, owing more to Mitchell's memories of childhood in Canada and her study of classical music. \"Dreamland\" and \"The Tenth World\", featuring Chaka Khan on backing vocals, were percussion-dominated tracks. Other songs continued the jazz-rock-folk collisions of \"Hejira\". Mitchell also revived \"Jericho\", written years earlier (a version is found on her 1974 live album) but never recorded in a studio setting. \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\" was released in December 1977. The album received mixed reviews but still sold relatively well, peaking at No. 25 in the US and going gold within three months. The cover of the album created its own controversy: Mitchell was featured in several photographs, including one where she was disguised as a black man, wearing a curly afro wig, a white suit and vest, and dark sunglasses. The character, whom she called Art Nouveau, was based on a pimp who, she says, once complimented her while walking down an LA street – and was a symbol of her turn toward jazz and streetwise lyrics.\n\nA few months after the release of \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\", Mitchell was contacted by the esteemed jazz composer, bandleader and bassist Charles Mingus, who had heard the orchestrated song \"Paprika Plains\", and wanted her to work with him. She began a collaboration with Mingus, who died before the project was completed in 1979. She finished the tracks, and the resulting album, \"Mingus\", was released in June 1979, though it was poorly received in the press. Fans were confused over such a major change in Mitchell's overall sound, and though the album topped out at No. 17 on the Billboard album charts—a higher placement than \"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\"—\"Mingus\" still fell short of gold status, making it her first album since the 1960s to not sell at least a half-million copies.\n\nMitchell's tour to promote \"Mingus\" began in August 1979 in Oklahoma City and concluded six weeks later with five shows at Los Angeles' Greek Theatre and one at the Santa Barbara County Bowl, where she recorded and filmed the concert. It was her first tour in several years, and with Pastorius, jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, and other members of her band, Mitchell also performed songs from her other jazz-inspired albums. When the tour ended she began a year of work, turning the tapes from the Santa Barbara County Bowl show into a two-album set and a concert film, both to be called \"Shadows and Light\". Her final release on Asylum Records and her second live double-album, it was released in September 1980, and made it up to No. 38 on the Billboard Charts. A single from the LP, \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\", Mitchell's duet with The Persuasions (her opening act for the tour), bubbled under on Billboard, just missing the Hot 100.\n\nFor a year and a half, Mitchell worked on the tracks for her next album. During this period she recorded with bassist Larry Klein, whom she married in 1982. While the album was being readied for release, her friend David Geffen, founder of Asylum Records, decided to start a new label, Geffen Records. Still distributed by Warner Bros. (who controlled Asylum Records), Geffen negated the remaining contractual obligations Mitchell had with Asylum and signed her to his new label. \"Wild Things Run Fast\" (1982) marked a return to pop songwriting, including \"Chinese Cafe/Unchained Melody\", which incorporated the chorus and parts of the melody of the famous The Righteous Brothers hit, and \"(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care\", a remake of the Elvis chestnut, which charted higher than any Mitchell single since her 1970s sales peak when it climbed to No. 47 on the charts. The album peaked on the Billboard Charts in its fifth week at No. 25.\n\nIn early 1983, Mitchell began a world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia and then going back to the United States. A performance from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video (and later DVD) as \"Refuge of the Roads\". As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs, when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. British synthpop performer and producer Thomas Dolby was brought on board. Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented: \"I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record [by Geffen], and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did have some problems ... He may be able to do it faster. He may be able to do it better, but the fact is that it then wouldn't really be my music.\"\n\nThe album that resulted, \"Dog Eat Dog\", released in October 1985, turned out to be only a moderate seller, peaking at No. 63 on Billboard's Top Albums Chart, Mitchell's lowest chart position since her first album peaked at No. 189 almost eighteen years before. One of the songs on the album, \"Tax Free\", created controversy by lambasting \"televangelists\" and what she saw as a drift to the religious right in American politics. \"The churches came after me\", she wrote, \"they attacked me, though the Episcopalian Church, which I've seen described as the only church in America which actually uses its head, wrote me a letter of congratulation.\"\n\nMitchell continued experimenting with synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers for the recordings of her next album, 1988's \"Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm\". She also collaborated with artists including Willie Nelson, Billy Idol, Wendy & Lisa, Tom Petty, Don Henley, Peter Gabriel, and Benjamin Orr of the Cars. The album's first official single, \"My Secret Place\", was in fact a duet with Gabriel, and just missed the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The song \"Lakota\" was one of many songs on the album to take on larger political themes, in this case the Wounded Knee incident, the deadly battle between Native American activists and the FBI on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the previous decade. Musically, several songs fit into the trend of world music popularized by Gabriel during the era. Reviews were mostly favorable towards the album, and the cameos by well-known musicians brought it considerable attention. \"Chalk Mark\" ultimately improved on the chart performance of \"Dog Eat Dog\", peaking at No. 45.\n\nIn 1990, Mitchell, who by then rarely performed live anymore, participated in Roger Waters' \"The Wall Concert in Berlin\". She performed the song \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" and was also one of the performers on the concert's final song \"The Tide Is Turning\" along with Waters, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams, Van Morrison and Paul Carrack.\n\nThroughout the first half of 1990, Mitchell recorded songs that appeared on her next album. She delivered the final mixes for the new album to Geffen just before Christmas, after trying nearly a hundred different sequences for the songs. The album \"Night Ride Home\" was released in March 1991. In the United States, it premiered on Billboard's Top Album charts at No. 68, moving up to No. 48 in its second week, and peaking at No. 41 in its sixth week. In the United Kingdom, the album premiered at No. 25 on the album charts. Critically, it was better received than her 1980s work and seemed to signal a move closer to her acoustic beginnings, along with some references to the style of \"Hejira\". This album was also Mitchell's first since Geffen Records was sold to MCA Inc., meaning that \"Night Ride Home\" was her first album not to be initially distributed by WEA (now Warner Music Group).\n\nTo wider audiences, the real \"return to form\" for Mitchell came with 1994's Grammy-winning \"Turbulent Indigo\". While the recording period also saw the divorce of Mitchell and bassist Larry Klein, their marriage having lasted almost 12 years, \"Indigo\" was seen as Mitchell's most accessible set of songs in years. Songs such as \"Sex Kills\", \"Sunny Sunday\", \"Borderline\" and \"The Magdalene Laundries\" mixed social commentary and guitar-focused melodies for \"a startling comeback\". The album won two Grammy awards, including Best Pop Album, and it coincided with a much-publicized resurgence in interest in Mitchell's work by a younger generation of singer-songwriters.\n\nIn 1996, Mitchell agreed to release a greatest \"Hits\" collection when label Reprise also allowed her a second album, called \"Misses\", to include some of the lesser known songs from her career. \"Hits\" charted at No. 161 in the US, but made No. 6 in the UK. Mitchell also included on \"Hits\", for the first time on an album, her first recording, a version of \"Urge for Going\" which preceded \"Song to a Seagull\" but was previously released only as a B-side.\nTwo years later, Mitchell released her final set of \"original\" new work before nearly a decade of other pursuits, 1998's \"Taming the Tiger\". She promoted \"Tiger\" with a return to regular concert appearances, including a co-headlining tour with Bob Dylan and Van Morrison.\n\nOn the album, Mitchell had played a custom guitar equipped with a Roland hexaphonic pickup which connected to a Roland VG-8 modeling processor. The device allowed Mitchell to play any of her many alternate tunings without having to re-tune the guitar. The guitar's output, through the VG-8, was transposed to any of her tunings in real-time. This improved live performance as Mitchell didn't need to switch guitars between songs.\n\nIt was around this time that critics also began to notice a real change in Mitchell's voice, particularly on her older songs; the singer later admitted to feeling the same way, explaining that \"I'd go to hit a note and there was nothing there\". While her more limited range and huskier vocals have sometimes been attributed to her smoking (she has been described as \"one of the world's last great smokers\"), Mitchell believes that the changes in her voice that became noticeable in the 1990s were due to other problems, including vocal nodules, a compressed larynx, and the lingering effects of having had polio. In an interview in 2004, she denied that \"my terrible habits\" had anything to do with her more limited range and pointed out that singers often lose the upper register when they pass fifty. In addition, she contended that in her opinion her voice became a more interesting and expressive alto range when she could no longer hit the high notes, let alone hold them like she did in her youth.\n\nThe singer's next two albums featured no new songs and, Mitchell has said, were recorded to \"fulfill contractual obligations\", but on both she attempted to make use of her new vocal range in interpreting familiar material. \"Both Sides Now\" (2000) was an album composed mostly of covers of jazz standards, performed with an orchestra, featuring orchestral arrangements by Vince Mendoza. The album also contained remakes of \"A Case of You\" and the title track \"Both Sides, Now\", two early hits transposed down to Mitchell's now dusky, soulful alto range. It received mostly strong reviews and spawned a short national tour, with Mitchell accompanied by a core band featuring Larry Klein on bass plus a local orchestra on each tour stop. Its success led to 2002's \"Travelogue\", a collection of re-workings of her previous songs with lush orchestral accompaniments.\n\nMitchell stated at the time that \"Travelogue\" would be her final album. In a 2002 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", she voiced discontent with the current state of the music industry, describing it as a \"cesspool\". Mitchell expressed her dislike of the record industry's dominance and her desire to control her own destiny, possibly by releasing her own music over the Internet.\n\nDuring the next few years, the only albums Mitchell released were compilations of her earlier work. In 2003, her Geffen recordings were collected in a remastered four-disc box set, \"The Complete Geffen Recordings\", including notes by Mitchell and three previously unreleased tracks. A series of themed compilations of songs from earlier albums were also released: \"The Beginning of Survival\" (2004), \"Dreamland\" (2004), and \"Songs of a Prairie Girl\" (2005), the last of which collected the threads of her Canadian upbringing and which she released after accepting an invitation to the Saskatchewan Centennial concert in Saskatoon. The concert, which featured a tribute to Mitchell, was also attended by Queen Elizabeth II. In the \"Prairie Girl\" liner notes, she writes that the collection is \"my contribution to Saskatchewan's Centennial celebrations\".\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mitchell signed a deal with Random House to publish an autobiography. In 1998 she told \"The New York Times\" that her memoirs were \"in the works\", that they would be published in as many as four volumes, and that the first line would be \"I was the only black man at the party.\" In 2005, Mitchell said that she was using a tape recorder to get her memories \"down in the oral tradition\". To date, Mitchell's autobiography remains unpublished.\n\nAlthough Mitchell stated that she would no longer tour or give concerts, she has made occasional public appearances to speak on environmental issues. Mitchell divides her time between her longtime home in Los Angeles, and the property in Sechelt, British Columbia, that she has owned since the early 1970s. \"L.A. is my workplace\", she said in 2006, \"B.C. is my heartbeat\". According to interviews, today she focuses mainly on her visual art, which she does not sell and displays only on rare occasions.\n\nIn an interview with the \"Ottawa Citizen\" in October 2006, Mitchell \"revealed that she was recording her first collection of new songs in nearly a decade\", but gave few other details. Four months later, in an interview with the \"New York Times\", Mitchell said that the forthcoming album, titled \"Shine\", was inspired by the war in Iraq and \"something her grandson had said while listening to family fighting: 'Bad dreams are good—in the great plan.'\" Early media reports characterized the album as having \"a minimal feel ... that harks back to [Mitchell's] early work\" and a focus on political and environmental issues.\n\nIn February 2007, Mitchell returned to Calgary and served as an advisor for the Alberta Ballet Company premiere of \"The Fiddle and the Drum\", a dance choreographed by Jean Grand-Maître to both new and old songs. She worked with the French-Canadian TV director Mario Rouleau, well known for work in art and dance for television, such as Cirque du Soleil. She also filmed portions of the rehearsals for a documentary that she is working on. Of the flurry of recent activity she quipped, \"I've never worked so hard in my life.\"\n\nIn mid-2007, Mitchell's official fan-run site confirmed speculation that she had signed a two-record deal with Starbucks' Hear Music label. \"Shine\" was released by the label on September 25, 2007, debuting at number 14 on the Billboard 200 album chart, her highest chart position in the United States since the release of \"Hejira\" in 1976, over thirty years previously, and at number 36 on the United Kingdom albums chart.\n\nOn the same day, Herbie Hancock, a longtime associate and friend of Mitchell's, released \"\", an album paying tribute to Mitchell's work. Among the album's contributors were Norah Jones, Tina Turner, Leonard Cohen, and Mitchell herself, who contributed a vocal to the re-recording of \"The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)\" (originally on her album \"Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm\"). On February 10, 2008, Hancock's recording won Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. It was the first time in 43 years that a jazz artist took the top prize at the annual award ceremony. In accepting the award, Hancock paid tribute to Mitchell as well as to Miles Davis and John Coltrane. At the same ceremony Mitchell won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Pop Performance for the opening track, \"One Week Last Summer\", from her album \"Shine\".\n\nIn a 2010 interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", Mitchell was quoted as saying that singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, with whom she had worked closely in the past, was a fake and a plagiarist. The controversial remark was widely reported by other media. Mitchell did not explain the contention further, but several media outlets speculated that it may have related to the allegations of plagiarism surrounding some lyrics on Dylan's 2006 album \"Modern Times\". In a 2013 interview with Jian Ghomeshi, she was asked about the comments and responded by denying that she had made the statement while mentioning the allegations of plagiarism that arose over the lyrics to Dylan's 2001 album \"Love and Theft\" in the general context of the flow and ebb of the creative process of artists.\n\nMitchell has said that she has Morgellons syndrome, and in 2010 said she planned to leave the music industry to work toward giving more credibility to people diagnosed with Morgellons.\n\nIn 2015, Mitchell had a brain aneurysm, which required her to undergo physical therapy, and take part in daily rehabilitation every day. Mitchell made her first public appearance following the aneurysm when she attended a Chick Corea concert in Los Angeles in August 2016. She has made a few other appearances, and in November 2018, David Crosby said that she was learning to walk again.\n\nDespite her prominence among the young musicians of the 1960s and 1970s, and her writing of \"Woodstock\" (where she was prevented from performing because her manager thought it was more advantageous to appear on \"The Dick Cavett Show\"), she did not align herself with the Baby Boom era's protest movements or its cultural manifestation, the associated 1960s counter-culture. She has said that the parents of the boomers were unhappy, and \"out of it came this liberated, spoiled, selfish generation into the costume ball of free love, free sex, free music, free, free, free, free we're so free. And Woodstock was the culmination of it.\" But \"I was not a part of that,\" she explained in an interview. \"I was not a part of the anti-war movement, either. I played in Fort Bragg. I went the Bob Hope route because I had uncles who died in the war, and I thought it was a shame to blame the boys who were drafted.\" Even Bob Dylan, one of the most iconic musicians of the Baby Boom generation, has not escaped Mitchell's generational critique: \"I like a lot of Bob's songs. Musically he's not very gifted.\"\n\nWhile some of Mitchell's most popular songs were written on piano, almost every song she composed on the guitar uses an open, or non-standard, tuning; she has written songs in some 50 tunings, playing what she has called \"Joni's weird chords\". The use of alternative tunings allows guitarists to produce accompaniment with more varied and wide-ranging textures. Her right-hand picking/strumming technique has evolved over the years from an initially intricate picking style, typified by the guitar songs on her first album, to a looser and more rhythmic style, sometimes incorporating percussive \"slaps\".\n\nIn 1995, Mitchell's friend Fred Walecki, proprietor of Westwood Music in Los Angeles, developed a solution to alleviate her continuing frustration with using multiple alternative tunings in live settings. Walecki designed a Stratocaster-style guitar to function with the Roland VG-8 virtual guitar, a system capable of configuring her numerous tunings electronically. While the guitar itself remained in standard tuning, the VG-8 encoded the pickup signals into digital signals which were then translated into the altered tunings. This allowed Mitchell to use one guitar on stage, while an off-stage tech entered the preprogrammed tuning for each song in her set.\n\nMitchell was also highly innovative harmonically in her early work (1966–72), incorporating modality, chromaticism, and pedal points. On her 1968 debut album \"Song to a Seagull\", Mitchell used both quartal and quintal harmony in \"Dawntreader\" and quintal harmony in \"Seagull\".\n\nIn 2003 \"Rolling Stone\" named her the 72nd greatest guitarist of all time; she was the highest-ranked woman on the list.\n\nMitchell's approach to music struck a chord with many female listeners. In an era dominated by the stereotypical male rock star, she presented herself as \"multidimensional and conflicted ... allow[ing] her to build such a powerful identification among her female fans\". Mitchell asserted her desire for artistic control throughout her career, and still holds the publishing rights for her music. She has disclaimed the notion that she is a \"feminist\"; in a 2013 interview she rejected the label, stating, \"I'm not a feminist. I don't want to get a posse against men. I'd rather go toe-to-toe; work it out.\" David Shumway notes that Mitchell \"became the first woman in popular music to be recognized as an artist in the full sense of that term... Whatever Mitchell's stated views of feminism, what she represents more than any other performer of her era is the new prominence of women's perspectives in cultural and political life.\"\n\nMitchell's work has had an influence on many other artists, including Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, Corinne Bailey Rae, Gabrielle Aplin, Mikael Åkerfeldt from Opeth, Marillion members Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery, their former vocalist and lyricist Fish, Paul Carrack, Haim, and Taylor Swift. Madonna has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke to her as a teenager; \"I was really, really into Joni Mitchell. I knew every word to \"Court and Spark\"; I worshipped her when I was in high school. \"Blue\" is amazing. I would have to say of all the women I've heard, she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view.\"\n\nSeveral artists have had success covering Mitchell's songs. Judy Collins's 1967 recording of \"Both Sides, Now\" reached No. 8 on Billboard charts and was a breakthrough in the career of both artists (Mitchell's own recording did not see release until two years later, on her second album \"Clouds\"). This is Mitchell's most-covered song by far, with over 1,200 versions recorded at latest count. Hole also covered \"Both Sides, Now\" in 1991 on their debut album, \"Pretty on the Inside\", retitling it \"Clouds\", with the lyrics altered by frontwoman Courtney Love. Pop group Neighborhood in 1970 and Amy Grant in 1995 scored hits with covers of \"Big Yellow Taxi\", the third-most covered song in Mitchell's repertoire (with over 300 covers). Recent releases of this song have been by Counting Crows in 2002 and Nena in 2007. Janet Jackson used a sample of the chorus of \"Big Yellow Taxi\" as the centerpiece of her 1997 hit single \"Got 'Til It's Gone\", which also features rapper Q-Tip saying \"Joni Mitchell never lies\". \"River\", from Mitchell's album \"Blue\" became the second-most covered song of Mitchell's in 2013 as many artists chose it for their holiday albums. Rap artists Kanye West and Mac Dre have also sampled Mitchell's vocals in their music. In addition, Annie Lennox has covered \"Ladies of the Canyon\" for the B-side of her 1995 hit \"No More I Love You's\". Mandy Moore covered \"Help Me\" in 2003. In 2004 singer George Michael covered her song \"Edith and the Kingpin\" for a radio show. \"River\" has been one of the most popular songs covered in recent years, with versions by Dianne Reeves (1999), James Taylor (recorded for television in 2000, and for CD release in 2004), Allison Crowe (2004), Rachael Yamagata (2004), Aimee Mann (2005), and Sarah McLachlan (2006). McLachlan also did a version of \"Blue\" in 1996, and Cat Power recorded a cover of \"Blue\" in 2008. Other Mitchell covers include the famous \"Woodstock\" by both Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and Matthews Southern Comfort, \"This Flight Tonight\" by Nazareth, and well-known versions of \"Woodstock\" by Eva Cassidy and \"A Case of You\" by Tori Amos, Michelle Branch, Jane Monheit, Prince, Diana Krall, James Blake, and Ana Moura. A 40th anniversary version of \"Woodstock\" was released in 2009 by Nick Vernier Band featuring Ian Matthews (formerly of Matthews Southern Comfort). Fellow Canadian singer k.d. lang recorded two of Mitchell's songs (\"A Case of You\" and \"Jericho\") for her 2004 album \"Hymns of the 49th Parallel\" which is composed entirely of songs written by Canadian artists.\n\nPrince's version of \"A Case of U\" appeared on \"A Tribute to Joni Mitchell\", a 2007 compilation released by Nonesuch Records, which also featured Björk (\"The Boho Dance\"), Caetano Veloso (\"Dreamland\"), Emmylou Harris (\"The Magdalene Laundries\"), Sufjan Stevens (\"Free Man in Paris\") and Cassandra Wilson (\"For the Roses\"), among others.\n\nSeveral other songs reference Joni Mitchell. The song \"Our House\" by Graham Nash refers to Nash's two-year affair with Mitchell at the time that Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded the Déjà Vu album. Led Zeppelin's \"Going to California\" was said to be written about Robert Plant and Jimmy Page's infatuation with Mitchell, a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that, in live performances, Plant often says \"Joni\" after the line \"To find a queen without a king, they say she plays guitar and cries and sings\". Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses. The Sonic Youth song \"Hey Joni\" is named for Mitchell. Alanis Morissette also mentions Mitchell in one of her songs, \"Your House\". British folk singer Frank Turner mentions Mitchell in his song \"Sunshine State\". The Prince song \"The Ballad of Dorothy Parker\" contains the lyric – \" 'Oh, my favorite song' she said – and it was Joni singing 'Help me I think I'm falling' \". \"Lavender\" by Marillion was partly influenced by \"going through parks listening to Joni Mitchell\", according to vocalist and lyricist Fish, and she was later mentioned in the lyrics of their song \"Montreal\" from \"Sounds That Can't Be Made\". John Mayer makes reference to Mitchell and her \"Blue\" album in his song \"Queen of California\", from his 2012 album \"Born and Raised\". The song contains the lyric \"Joni wrote \"Blue\" in a house by the sea\".\n\nIn 2003, playwright Bryden MacDonald launched \"When All the Slaves Are Free\", a musical revue based on Mitchell's music.\n\nMitchell's music and poems have deeply influenced the French painter Jacques Benoit's work. Between 1979 and 1989 Benoit produced sixty paintings, corresponding to a selection of fifty of Mitchell's songs.\n\nMaynard James Keenan of the American progressive rock band Tool has cited Mitchell as an influence, claiming that her influence is what allows him to \"soften [staccato, rhythmic, insane mathematical paths] and bring [them] back to the center, so you can listen to it without having an eye-ache.\" A Perfect Circle, another band featuring Keenan as lead vocalist, recorded a rendition of Mitchell's \"The Fiddle and the Drum\" on their 2004 album \"eMOTIVe\", a collection of anti-war cover songs.\n\nMitchell's home country of Canada has bestowed several honours on her. She was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts, in 1996. Mitchell received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in 2000. In 2002 she became only the third popular Canadian singer-songwriter (Gordon Lightfoot and Leonard Cohen being the other two), to be appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honour. She received an honorary doctorate in music from McGill University in 2004. In January 2007 she was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Beahan (August 9, 1918 – March 9, 1989) was a career officer in the United States Air Force and its predecessor United States Army Air Forces during World War II. He was the bombardier on the crew flying the Boeing B-29 Superfortress \"Bockscar\" on August 9, 1945 (his 27th birthday), that dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan.\n\nHe also participated in the first atomic mission that bombed Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Flying as part of the crew of \"The Great Artiste\" which was a reference to him, purportedly because he could \"hit a pickle barrel with a bomb from 30,000 feet\" or he was \"good with the fairer sex,\" his aircraft acted as the blast instrumentation support aircraft for the mission.\n\nBeahan attended Rice University on a football scholarship during the 1930s. In 1939 he joined the Army Air Forces as an aviation cadet but washed out of pilot training, becoming a bombardier instead. He was assigned to the 97th Bombardment Group and took part in the first B-17 raids in Europe by Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. He flew 13 missions over Europe, 17 missions over North Africa, and five credited combat missions in the Pacific with the 509th Composite Group (including the Nagasaki sortie). He was shot down and crash-landed four times (twice in Europe and North Africa). He returned to the United States as a bombing instructor in Midland, Texas. In the summer of 1944, he was recruited by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets to be part of the 509th Composite Group, which was formed to deliver the atomic bomb.\n\nThe mission to bomb Nagasaki was conducted on Beahan's 27th birthday. Admiral Frederick L. Ashworth, who participated on the mission as weaponeer, credited Beahan with saving the mission from failure by finding an opening in the clouds by which to complete the required visual bombing of the city. An estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed outright by the bombing of Nagasaki.\n\nFollowing the Japanese surrender, he returned to the United States as a crewman in the record-breaking 1945 Japan–Washington flight under Lieutenant General Barney M. Giles. He remained in the Air Force until 1964, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. After his retirement, he worked as a technical writer for the engineering and construction firm Brown & Root through 1985.\n\nIn 1985, on the 40th anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing, Beahan said he would never apologize for the bombing, and that he had been thanked for his role by a group of 25 Japanese. He said the bombing was the \"best way out of a hell of a mess.\" Beahan hoped that he would forever remain the last man to have dropped an atomic bomb on people.\n\nHe died of heart attack in 1989. He was buried at the Houston National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, the former Teresa Lavery of Belfast. Lavery had a previous marriage, from 1944–46, to Civil War historian Shelby Foote after having met when Foote's artillery unit was deployed to Northern Ireland. Foote had spent six years in the US military and was tasked with making preparations for the invasion of Japan but in spite of his desires, never saw combat. \"...Foote was devastated that World War II was over\", and it was Beahan, the future husband of his ex-wife who ended it.\n\n\n"}

In 1907 she became editor of the newspaper \"Lotta di classe\", a socialist revolutionary publication. With Filippo Corridoni, she also founded the anti-militarist broadsheet \"Rompete le file\". She voiced the opinion that women should oppose militarism, as they gave birth to the soldiers killed in war on behalf of the state.\nIn 1909, she began to support anarchism in Italy. She became active in contributing to \"La Demolizione\" of the syndicalist Ottavio Dinale from 1907 to 1911.\nA World War I interventionist in 1914, she became an editor at the newspaper founded by Benito Mussolini, \"Il Popolo d'Italia\". The socialist daily founded by Mussolini was devoted to supporting the campaign for intervention by Italy in the War. As a syndicalist and union supporter, she was jailed for a period in 1914.

{"id": "12785745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12785745", "title": "Michel Garicoïts", "text": "Michel Garicoïts\n\nSaint Michel Garicoïts (15 April 1797 – 14 May 1863) was a French Basque Roman Catholic priest and the founder of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Bétharram. He combated Jansenism in his parish due to the threat that it posed to the faith. He served as a teacher and preacher and was known for his ardent devotion to both the Eucharist and the Sacred Heart.\n\nThe sainthood cause commenced under Pope Leo XIII in mid-1899 while Pope Benedict XV later named him as Venerable on 10 December 1916 upon the confirmation of his heroic virtue. Pope Pius XI beatified him in 1923 while Pope Pius XII later canonized him as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church over a decade later in 1947.\n\nMichel Garicoïts was born on 15 April 1797 in Saint-Just-Ibarre as the first of six children of the peasants Arnaud Garicoïts and Gratianne Etchéverry. His parents remained faithful and true to the spirit of the faith during the persecutions of the French Revolution while also doing their best to shelter priests. His father helped priests flee persecution and helped them cross the border into Spain. One brother was born after him in 1799.\n\nIn 1801 he trespassed into his neighbour's home and hurled a stone at a woman who he believed had wronged his mother before fleeing the scene. In 1802 he stole a pack of needles from a travelling salesman – his mother reprimanded him for this – and in 1804 stole an apple from his brother to his mother's disdain. In 1806 he was sent to the village school but was taken out in 1809 to work as a servant on a farm for additional income.\n\nIn his childhood he was noted for silent contemplation and for singing Psalms while guarding the cattle. In 1810 he was sent as a servant to another farm at Oneix and there made his First Communion on 9 June 1811 – it was this event that served as the trigger for his religious vocation. He decided that he wanted to become a priest and so returned to his hometown and told his father: \"I want to be a priest\". His father said it would be impossible due to their poor financial condition (he said: \"No! We are too poor\") but his maternal grandmother Catherine Etchéverry knew a parish priest and convinced him to enroll him at school for studies before he became a seminarian. He attended school at Saint-Palais where he studied Latin and French in the candlelight late into the night while paid his expenses through working for priests and in the local bishop's kitchen – the cook there had a disliking for him for unknown reasons. The parish priest Jean Baptiste Borda gave him private lessons. Garicoïts commenced his studies for the priesthood in Aire-sur-Adour and later in Dax. He was asked to teach seminarians at Larressore despite still being a student himself. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 20 December 1823 at the Bayonne Cathedral from Archbishop – future cardinal – Paul-Thérèse-David d'Astros.\n\nHe was appointed as the curate to the town of Cambo not too far from where he was ordained and he was there from the beginning of 1824 until late 1825 when he was sent to Bétharram to teach philosophical studies. In 1833 the diocesan bishop ceased education for seminarians in that place for unknown reasons and he was left to care for that Marian shrine and its pilgrims. It dawned on him to begin his own religious congregation for all priests and professed brothers and dedicated it to the Sacred Heart as a means of evangelizing to people through missions. Before he founded it he attended a month retreat with the Jesuits in 1832 for guidance and his spiritual director Father Le Blanc helped to guide him along the right path. Garicoïts helped Saint Jean Elizabeth Bichier des Ages found her religious order while later establishing his own in 1838.\n\nHe died in the morning about 3:00am in mid-1863 due to an apoplexy. He had suffered from poor health since 1853 and in 1859 was quite ill but rallied from this until Lent in 1863 when his condition deteriorated to the point where he knew his death was near. His final words in a low murmur were: \"Have pity on me, Lord, in Your great mercy\".\n\nHis Basque surname is the origin of the male name \"Garikoitz\".\n\nThe sainthood process commenced under Pope Leo XIII on 15 May 1899 and Garicoïts was titled as a Servant of God. Pope Benedict XV confirmed that the late priest had lived a model life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable on 10 December 1916 as a result. Two miracles approved allowed for Pope Pius XI to preside over his beatification on 10 May 1923 while a decree resumed the cause on 23 July 1924.\n\nTwo additional miracles were investigated and received the validation of the Congregation for Rites on 17 July 1929. A preparatory committee approved them both on 13 April 1943 as did a general committee on 15 February 1944 and Pope Pius XII on 27 February 1944 who confirmed his sainthood. Pius XII proclaimed Garicoïts to be a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 6 July 1947.\n\n"}

In his hometown of Lavras, Haddad was the leader of the pop-rock band Os Miseráveis (later renamed Electron 6). The group disbanded and with three other high school friends, he formed the group Zin performing mostly British/American as well as popular Brazilian music. Haddad later moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he studied at the Villa-Lôbos Institute and pursued private classical guitar studies. At the height of the military dictatorship, music schools were not well funded in Brazil, so Haddad transferred to the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where he received his bachelor's degree in composition in 1979. He later received a Masters of Science in Arts Administration from Drexel University in 1986, and in 2002 a Masters in Composition from Temple University, in Philadelphia.\n\nPatricia King Haddad (born Patricia Gale King on April 27, 1956, in Denver, Colorado) grew up in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where she began her music education studying voice and piano, performed in musicals and theatrical productions at age six. In 1974 she enrolled at University of North Carolina School of the Arts (UNCSA) where she studied opera and continued piano studies and composition. She holds a master's degree in Jazz Piano Performance from Philadelphia's University of the Arts and a degree in classical voice from UNCSA.

Alves moved to the US and joined King & Haddad to form a trio which they named Minas, after Haddad and Alves’ home state of Minas Gerais. Soon the trio became a quartet with the addition of bassist Rick Heyman, who was from Paramus, NJ. Minas went on for a couple of years performing until Alves left the group and was replaced by Brazilian Manoel Monteiro, originally from São Paulo. The group worked extensively in the southern states of North and South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and up north in Pennsylvania, until both Rick and Manoel left the group for unknown reasons. Haddad and King continued performing under the name Minas as a duo from then til present time.\n\nHaddad and King were married in October 1979 in Lexington, VA. The ceremony was officiated by a long time friend, Rev. Langston Randolf Harrison, a teacher and missionary at Lavras' Instituto Gammon.

His father, Thamrin Mohd. Tabri, was the son of an English businessman who owned hotel Ort in Batavia, but had been raised by his Javanese uncle and had adopted his name. Thamrin was therefore born into a neo-priyayi class and in 1906, his father became district head () under Governor General Johan Cornelis van der Wijck. After graduating from Koning Willem III Gymnasium, Thamrin took several government jobs before working for the shipping company Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij.\n\nIn 1919, Thamrin was elected a member of the Jakarta City Council. He later became deputy mayor. In 1927 he was elected to the Volksraad; he soon formed the National Fraction () to unite ten groups of Indonesian nationalists under one flag and counteract the reactionary Fatherlands Club (). Along with Dr. Soetomo, Parindra's chair, Thamrin believed that independence could be achieved through cooperation with the Dutch colonial government.\n\nAs a Volksraad member, Thamrin and Kusumom Utoyo went to eastern Sumatra to look into working conditions at plantations there. Disgusted by what they found, upon his return Thamrin gave a speech condemning the plantation owners. He criticised the legalised gambling and corporal punishments given for minor offences. In 1935 he was a founding member of the Grand Indonesia Party (, or Parindra).\n\nAfter the death of Dr. Soetomo in 1938, Thamrin became deputy chair of Parindra. In at a meeting of the Volksraad in 1939, Thamrin proposed that the Dutch terms Nederlands Indie, Nederlands Indisch and Inlander (Dutch Indies, Dutch Indian, and Dutch Indians) be replaced with the nationalist terms Indonesia, Indonesisch, and Indonesier (Indonesia, Indonesian, and Indonesians). Although this received majority support in the Volksraad, the Dutch government vetoed the motion. After his request, the colonial government kept him under surveillance. By 1940, his proposal for the use of the term Indonesian had begun to receive consideration, much to Thamrin's perplexity.\n\nIn May 1939, Thamrin spearheaded an effort to unite eight nationalist organisations, including Parindra, in the Indonesian Political Federation (, or GAPI). The group had four main goals: Indonesian self-determination, national unity, a democratically elected party answering to the Indonesian people, and solidarity between Indonesians and the Dutch to combat fascism.\n\nOn 6 January 1941, Thamrin was put under house arrest under suspicion of aiding the advancing Japanese forces; he had previously maintained warm relations with Japanese residents of the Indies. Already ill, he died five days after his arrest. He was buried in Karet Bivak Cemetery, Central Jakarta.\n\nThamrin has several objects named after him, including Jalan M.H. Thamrin, a thoroughfare in Central Jakarta, and Mohammad Husni Thamrin School for the Gifted, a school in East Jakarta for students with an IQ of more than 120. His old home on Kenari street in Senen, Central Jakarta, is now a museum dedicated to his life. Two statues of Thamrin have been erected in Jakarta: a bust near the National Monument and a full-body statue in front of the Thamrin Museum.\n\nHe was declared a National Hero of Indonesia in 1964.\n\n"}

In most of the editions of the Mishnah this treatise is the fourth in the order Nashim, and it is divided into 9 chapters, containing 48 paragraphs in all.\n\nChapter 1: The different kinds of vows which involve compulsory Nazariteship (§§ 1-2); Nazariteship for life, Samson's Nazariteship (compare Judges 12:4 et seq.), and the difference between these two kinds (§ 2); Nazariteship is calculated by days only, not by hours, and generally lasts thirty days if no definite period is given (§ 3); different expressions which make a sort of lifelong Nazariteship compulsory, although the hair may be cut once in thirty days (§ 4); peculiar indefinite expressions used in connection with the vow (§§ 5-7).\n\nChapter 2: Whether vows which are expressed in a peculiar, incorrect manner are binding (§§ 1-2); cases in which a clearly expressed vow of Nazariteship is not binding (§ 3); vows made under conditions incompatible with Nazariteship (§ 4); combination of two Nazariteships, or of one with the vow to bring an additional sacrifice for a Nazarite; conditional vows (§§ 5-9).\n\nChapter 3: When a Nazarite may cut his hair in case he has vowed only one term of Nazariteship, or when he has vowed two successive terms (§§ 1-2); whether a Nazarite who has become unclean on the last day of his term must recommence his Nazariteship, and the cases in which he must do so (§§ 3-4); the case of one who vows Nazariteship while in a burial-place (§ 5); Nazariteship may be observed only in the Holy Land; Helena, Queen of Adiabene, once vowed Nazariteship for seven years, and fulfilled her vow; but when she went to the land of Israel at the end of the seventh year, the Bet Hillel decided that she must observe her vow for another period of seven years, since the time which she had spent outside of the land of Israel could not be taken into account (§ 6).\n\nChapter 4: Cases in which a person utters a vow of Nazariteship and those present say, \"We too\"; dispensation from such vows; concerning the nullification of a wife's vows of Nazariteship by her husband (§§ 1-5); the father may make a vow of Nazariteship for his minor son, but not the mother; and in like manner the son, but not the daughter, may, in certain cases and in certain respects, succeed to the father's term of Nazariteship (§§ 6-7).\n\nChapter 5: Cases in which a person dedicates or vows something by mistake; Nazarites who had made their vows before the destruction of the Temple, and, on coming to Jerusalem to offer their sacrifices, had learned that the Temple had been destroyed (§ 4); conditional Nazaritic vows (§§ 5-7).\n\nChapter 6: Things forbidden to the Nazarite; enumeration of the different things coming from the vine; cases in which a Nazarite is guilty of trespassing against the interdiction prohibiting the drinking of wine (§§ 1-2); cases in which he is guilty of trespassing against that concerning the cutting of his hair (§ 3); in what respects the interdiction against defilement by a corpse is more rigorous than those against drinking wine and cutting the hair, and in what respects the last two interdictions are more rigorous than the first (§ 5); sacrifices and cutting of the hair if the Nazarite has become unclean (§ 6); sacrifices and cutting of the hair when the Nazariteship is fulfilled; burning of the cut hair under the pot in which the flesh of the sacrifice is cooked; other regulations regarding the sacrifices by Nazarites (§§ 7-11).\n\nChapter 7: The Nazarite and the Kohen Gadol may not defile themselves through contact with corpses even in the case of the death of a near relative; discussion of the question whether the Nazarite or the high priest defiles himself if both together find a corpse which must be buried and no one else is there to do it (§ 1); things which defile the Nazarite, and other regulations regarding the uncleanness of a person entering the Temple (§§ 2-3).\n\nChapter 8: Regulations in cases where it is doubtful whether the Nazarite has become unclean.\n\nChapter 9: Unlike slaves and women, \"Kutim\" may not make a Nazaritic vow; in what respects Nazaritic vows of women are more rigorous than those of slaves, and vice versa (§ 1); further details regarding the defilement of a Nazarite; the examination of burial-places, and, in connection therewith, rules for the examination of a person suffering from discharges or tzaraath (§§ 2-4); discussion of the question whether Samuel was a Nazarite (§ 5).\n\nThe Tosefta to this treatise is divided into six chapters. Noteworthy is the story it narrates of the high priest Simon the Just, who never partook of the sacrifice offered by a Nazarite, with the exception of that offered by a handsome youth from the south, since in this case he could assume that the young man had made his vow with the best intentions and acceptably to God. When Simon asked why he had decided to clip his hair, the youth replied that on beholding his image in a pool he had become vain of his own beauty, and had therefore taken the Nazaritic vow to avoid all temptations (4:7).\n\nThe Babylonian Gemara, whose introductory passage explains, by a reference to the Bible (Deuteronomy 24:1; comp. Rashi ad loc., and \"Sotah\" 2a), why the treatise Nazir belongs to the order Nashim, contains also many interesting sentences, a few of which may be quoted here: \"The forty years (Samuel II 15:7) are reckoned from the time when the Israelites first asked for a king\" (5a). \"The Nazarite has sinned (Numbers 6:11) by denying himself wine; and if one who denies himself wine, which is not absolutely necessary, is deemed a sinner, one who denies himself other things which are needful for the sustenance of life is a much greater sinner\" (19a). \"An infringement of the Law with good intentions is better than its fulfilment without good intentions. Still one must study the Torah and observe its commandments, even though he is not in the proper mood, since he will gradually acquire thereby a sympathetic frame of mind\" (23b).\n\n"}

Her actions not only included helping to minister the sick and wounded Filipino combatants, but also played a major role in appeasing General Antonio Luna during his confrontation with General Tomas Mascardo. This contributed to the collapse of the Bagbag-Quingua-Sta. Maria defense line based on the Pampanga River, which was held against the American forces. \n\nGovernor Tiburcio Hilario, at the same time sent three emissaries to convince General Mascardo to submit himself to Luna's authority as Chief of Staff. At first Mascardo was nowhere to be found but later, he appeared in Betis to inform General Luna that he was willing to follow the latter's orders. That afternoon Luna returned to his headquarters, only to learn that his troops had been defeated in the Battle of Quingua.\n\nNicolasa Dayrit was born to Don Florentino Dayrit, a Cabeza de Barangay and Doña Antonina Pamintuan, in San Fernando, on September 10, 1874. She was one of the well-educated women of her time, having studied under Don Modesto Joaquin in Bacolor. Fluent in Spanish, she was also one of the two more accomplished pianists in the province, the other being Doña Josefa Henson.\n\nWhen American forces started bombarding this area, General Luna requested reinforcements from General Tomas Mascardo in Guagua, Pampanga but the latter carried out the order slowly and in protest. As a result, Luna ordered Mascardo arrest. The latter reacted sharply, arguing to Luna's emissary that while President Aguinaldo's decree applied to all troops of the provinces of Pampanga and Nueva Ecija, which were under Luna's jurisdiction, the decree did not apply to general officers of these troops. Mascardo concluded his response with the words, \"If General Luna has enough guts to enforce his decree, Mascardo has enough to resist him.\" \n\nIncensed, General Luna wired Governor Tiburcio Hilario to prepare for his arrival. He also ordered a special train into which all available infantry, cavalry, and artillery forces were loaded. To Luna, Mascardo's non-cooperation was a sign of weakness. \n\nAt this moment, the women of the province proved their high sense of patriotism while the men exerted every effort to bind and unite their armed forces. To the revolutionary leaders, the welfare of the Republic was greater than that of any man. Governor Tiburcio Hilario met General Luna first and pleaded with him to restore peace and unity at a crucial moment. He requested a delegation of women led by Nicolasa Dayrit and Pampanga's Red Cross President Praxedes Fajardo, to bring flowers and kneel before General Luna. The women met him on the steps of the convent in Bacolor on April 24, 1899, and successfully dissuaded Luna from violently confronting Mascardo.\n\nAt the end of the war, perhaps due to the rigors of ministering the sick and the wounded, Nicolasa found herself often ill, unable to leave her bed. Many doctors treated her, to no avail. Someone advised her family to consult a young doctor who had just arrived from Madrid, Dr. Vicente Panlilio. She married Dr. Panlilio, and he built for his bride a two storey house at San Jose Street, near Doña Antonina's house in the center of town. It was an elegant semi-concrete house with a concrete porch and a verandah through which one entered the living room. \n\nThe Panlilio's had five children: Luis, the eldest was a Harvard law graduate who became a good corporation lawyer and an industrialist, married Remedios Lazatin, the second was Carlos who seemed to be the tallest young man in town while Teresita who looked much like her mother, married Justice Augusto Luciano of Magalang; Pablo, an American, French educated architect, became successful in his field aside from being an industrialist, married socialite pianist Dolores Arguelles while the youngest is Lourdes. \n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, like most prominent families in San Fernando, the Panlilios lost their house to the Japanese. General Masaharu Homma occupied it. When Manila was declared an open city, the Panlilios moved in, hoping that they would be more secure there. But in the Battle of Malate, Dr. Panlilio was lost, never to be seen again. Doña Nicolasa became despondent and died of a heart attack on April 12, 1945, possibly due to her depression.\n\nOn September 9, 2004, her remains were transferred from Loyola Memorial Park in Sucat, Paranaque to the City of San Fernando, Pampanga with full honors and an overnight vigil with members of the Philippine Marines serving as honor guards. On September 10, 2006, the National Historical Institute placed a marker in her monument, recognizing her contributions to the fight for Philippine Independence.\n\n"}

{"id": "616567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=616567", "title": "Rob Rensenbrink", "text": "Rob Rensenbrink\n\nPieter Robert (\"Rob\") Rensenbrink (; born 3 July 1947) is a former Dutch footballer and member of the Dutch national football team that reached two World Cup finals in 1974 and 1978. A creative left winger or forward of considerable talent, he became a legend in Belgium whilst playing in the great Anderlecht side of the 1970s. He is the UEFA Cup Winners Cup's all-time top scorer, with 25 goals. A talented dribbler as well as a cool finisher and adequate passer, he only ever missed two penalties in his entire career. He was also the first winner of the Onze d'Or.\n\nBorn in Amsterdam, Rensenbrink started his career at DWS, an Amsterdam amateur club, before moving to Belgian side Club Brugge in 1969. Between 1971 and 1980 he played for Anderlecht where he enjoyed his greatest club successes. In total when in Belgium he twice won the Belgian Championships, the Belgian Cup five times and at European club level the European Cup Winners' Cup twice (in 1976 and 1978 as well as being runner-up in 1977). Rensenbrink delivered a notable performance in the 1976 final as Anderlecht ran out 4-2 winners against West Ham United. He scored two goals, one from the penalty spot and set up Francois Van der Elst for the fourth goal. Among his team mates was Dutch internationalist compatriot, Arie Haan. In 1980, he left Anderlecht and wound down his career with a spell at Portland Timbers in the NASL, followed by a brief stay with Toulouse in France in 1981.\n\nRensenbrink made his international debut for the Netherlands national football team against Scotland in 1968, but picked up relatively few caps due to competition for the forward positions with Johan Cruijff and Piet Keizer. However, Rinus Michels included him for the 1974 FIFA World Cup squad that made the short trip to West Germany.\n\nThe Dutch side that took part in the 1974 FIFA World Cup were the pinnacle of Total Football. Most of the 1974 team were made up of players from AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, so Rensenbrink was an outsider and was unfamiliar with playing the system. His preferred position was up front on the left, but that position was already Johan Cruijff's domain, so he played on the left-wing position in midfield, taking over from Ajax player Piet Keizer. He missed one game in the tournament (when Keizer played instead) and was only half-fit for the final after picking up an injury during the semi-final against Brazil. Rinus Michels gambled on Rensenbrink's fitness and played him from start – however he only lasted until half-time and was replaced by René van de Kerkhof. The Netherlands took an early lead through a Johan Neeskens penalty, but goals from Paul Breitner and Gerd Müller gave West Germany a 2–1 victory. Rensenbrink's performances saw him named to the team of the tournament and he was sought by Ajax as a replacement for Keizer. However, contract negotiations fell through and he remained at Anderlecht.\n\nRensenbrink stayed in the Dutch national side during the qualifiers and finals of the 1976 European Football Championship. However, the Netherlands fell at the semi-final stage to Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn the 1978 FIFA World Cup tournament in Argentina, the Netherlands again reached the final, but this time without Cruijff (who decided to retire from international football) and under the guidance of Ernst Happel rather than Michels. Out of the shadow of Cruijff, Rensenbrink found more room to showcase his own considerable talent, playing on the left-hand side of a front three alongside Johnny Rep and René van de Kerkhof. He scored a hat-trick in the opening game against Iran, another against Scotland which was goal number 1000 in World Cup history and a penalty in the 5–1 win over Austria. In the final against Argentina, the Netherlands yet again met the hosts. In a tumultuous match, the Netherlands fell behind to a first-half Mario Kempes strike. After Dick Nanninga's equalizer 9 minutes from time, a long pass from the Dutch captain Ruud Krol in the last 30 seconds of normal time gave Rensenbrink a half-chance to score but his shot from a very narrow angle was deflected on to the post and bounced clear. Had he scored, it is almost certain that Holland would have won the World Cup with Rensenbrink being top goal scorer. Argentina scored twice in extra-time for a 3–1 victory and the Netherlands again had to settle for the runners-up spot.\n\nRensenbrink played some of the qualifiers for Euro 80, but after earning his 46th cap in 1979 (a 2–0 defeat by Poland in a qualifier for Euro 80), he retired from international football at the age of 32, having scored 14 times for his country. He along with Eusébio are the only players to score the most goals from a penalty spot in a tournament (4 in 1978).\n\nHe was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He was also named Anderlecht's greatest ever player in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRensenbrink is married and lives in Oostzaan. In summer 2015 he revealed he had been diagnosed with progressive muscular atrophy three years earlier.\n\n"}

He had Down syndrome and was the widest-known Namibian that lived with the disease. Already in his youth he developed a passion for football and attended countless major and minor events. Later he supported other sports codes as well, notably boxing and athletics, and he was a noticeable member of the audience in uncountable high-profile Namibian social events. This was to an extent that on several occasions his unlikely absence would be noticed, for instance at a concert of The Rockets in Windhoek that was opened with the question \"Where is Robbie?\"\n\nAlthough a poor man throughout his life, Savage's role as mascot of the Brave Warriors enabled him to tour the African continent for several sports events.

In any case, the excitement of the Kazakhs were a direct continuation of the events.\n\nSyrym Datuly was from the Baibakty clan, Bayuli tribe of the Younger Zhuz.

Igelstrom was resigned in 1790 and in 1791 Yeraly was proclaimed as the Khan. In response, Syrym Datuly declared the war against Russia and killed its placeman Yesim who became the Khan after Yeraly. Many raids at the frontier line were made during ten years. In 1797 Syrym Datuly, who was pursued by sultans, had to roam to the south, lands of Khanate of Khiva with fellow tribesmen.

{"id": "6714158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6714158", "title": "The Deaf Man", "text": "The Deaf Man\n\nThe Deaf Man is a character in the 87th Precinct series of police procedurals by author Ed McBain (pseudonym of Evan Hunter). A criminal mastermind who delights in creating complex schemes, The Deaf Man is usually pitted against the men of the 87th Precinct as he creates havoc in the fictional city of Isola.\n\nThe Deaf Man is a tall, blond man whose real name is never revealed. He is a meticulous criminal planner who appears in a number of the 87th Precinct novels, usually plotting some spectacular crime while sending obscure, cryptic clues to the 87th Precinct, as if daring the detectives there to thwart him. In most of the stories, these clues are intended to mislead the police, directing them away from The Deaf Man's real goal.\n\nThe Deaf Man is not actually deaf; this is just another layer of disguise and misdirection. He wears a hearing aid, and uses odd pseudonyms referring to deafness. Examples include \"L. Sordo\" (\"el sordo\" means \"the deaf man\" in Spanish), \"Mort Orecchio\" (roughly \"dead ear\" in Italian), \"Den Dove\" (\"den döve\" means \"The deaf\" in Swedish) and D. R. Taubmann (\"der taub Mann\" meaning \"the deaf man\" in German). When he calls the detectives of the 87th, he'll commonly start the conversation with some version of \"You'll have to speak up. I'm a little hard of hearing\".\n\nHis main \"nemesis\" at the 87th Precinct (at least the one he contacts the most) seems to be Det. Steve Carella, who always feels a sense of irony in his dealing with The Deaf Man, since Carella is himself married to a deaf person. Both Carella and The Deaf Man have bullet wounds inflicted by the other, Carella from a shotgun in \"The Heckler\" and The Deaf Man from Carella's service revolver in \"Fuzz\". The Deaf Man even had Carella mugged and his badge/police ID stolen in \"Let's Hear It For The Deaf Man!\", which he has since used to impersonate Carella. The Deaf Man has no compunction about injuring or killing police officers or citizens during the commission of his crimes, but always has the motive of financial profit as his underlying goal. In later novels, he also has a secondary goal of getting revenge against Carella and the 87th for (often inadvertently) thwarting some of his most ambitious criminal plans.\n\nThe Deaf Man was last seen in \"Hark!\" (2004). The ending of the novel has the Deaf Man still free, and presumably able to plot more mischief for the 87th Precinct at some later time. \n\nThe Deaf Man appears in the following 87th Precinct novels:\n\n\nIn other 87th Precinct novels where The Deaf Man does not appear, characters on occasion make reference to him and his crimes.\n\nIn the movie version of \"Fuzz\", he was played by Yul Brynner.\n"}

He was also a renowned statesman, writer, and politician. Tomás Borge also held the titles of \"Vice-Secretary and President of the FSLN\", member of the Nicaraguan Parliament and National Congress, and Ambassador to Peru. Considered a hardliner, he led the \"prolonged people's war\" tendency within the FSLN until his death.\n\nIn 2010, he stated in an interview: \"I am proud to be a Sandinista, to continue being faithful to the red and black flag of our party, to continue being faithful to our revolutionary organization; and to die proud of raising the front, and not having been disloyal to my principles, nor disloyal with my friends nor my companions, nor with my flag, nor with my cries of war.\"\n\nBorge was born in Matagalpa on August 13, 1930. His father, Tomás Borge Delgado, was one of Augusto César Sandino's deputy commanders during the United States occupation of Nicaragua, from 1926 to 1932. From a young age, Borge integrated himself in the fight against the Somoza family dictatorship, which had ruled Nicaragua since the assassination of Sandino. In 1943, he began participating in revolutionary activities, and in 1946, he was editing the newspaper \"Espartako\" against the regime of General Anastasio Somoza García.\n\nAfter his secondary education, Borge enrolled into the Law Faculty of the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua-León in 1956. The following year, he met Carlos Fonseca with whom Borge would forge a strong friendship. Borge was six years older than Fonseca, which influenced Borge strongly. With Fonseca, Borge read the first few books that would forge their political philosophies: \"Utopia\" by Thomas More, some works by John Steinbeck, works by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as well as some works by Lenin.\n\nAlong with Fonseca, Borge participated in a group of Marxist Nicaraguan students, who formed the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN), which was based on Marxist thought and pro-Soviet leanings.\n\nHe was put under house arrest from 1956 to 1959 during the government crackdown following the assassination of Somoza by poet Rigoberto López Pérez. In 1959, he escaped to Honduras, where he was captured by the Honduran border patrol.\n\nOtto Castro, a friend of both Borge and the president of Honduras at the time, arranged for Borge's release. Borge then travelled using a false passport to El Salvador and Costa Rica, where he would found the \"Juventud Revolucionaria Nicaragüense\" (Nicaraguan Youth Revolutionaries).\n\nAfter the victorious Cuban Revolution, Fonseca, Borge, and a few companions decided to use militant tactics to fight against the Somoza regime. They participated in the formation of a militia under the command of Rigoberto López Pérez to face off against the National Guard of Nicaragua. The results were disastrous on July 24, 1959, when Fonseca was gravely injured. Then, Borge was in Costa Rica with Silvio Mayorga; they thought Fonseca had perished. Upon reuniting with Fonseca, the three left to Cuba and formed friendships with Che Guevara and Tamara Bunke, who had helped them with the guerilla.\n\nIn Cuba, Mayorga reunited with a group of young Nicaraguans from Venezuela, and they formed what would later be the \"Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional\" (National Sandinista Liberation Front). The name was derived from Augusto Sandino to convince Nicaraguans that Sandino's revolution was not dead. Also, the name Sandino was widely used to elicit strong emotion for the cause using the fallen leader's popularity. Fonseca traveled to Honduras to prepare the logistics that would permit the establishment of the group. On July 23, 1961, in Tegucigalpa, Borge, along with Carlos Fonseca, Francisco Buitrago, Jorge Navarro, Silvio Mayorga, José Benito Escobar, Noel Guerrero, and Germán Pomares, formed the FSLN, which would be the key to the downfall of the Somoza regime and the start of the Sandinista Revolution.\n\nThe FSLN was established in Honduras on the banks of the Patuka River. In 1962, the FSLN had 60 men in its ranks. Borge crossed into Nicaragua to recruit more members to the Sandinista cause.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1966, Tomás Borge headed the Sandinista newspaper \"The Republican Mobilization.\" The next year, he tried again to create an active guerrilla group in the mountains near the Pancasán region, which was defeated. In 1969, the National Directorate of the FSLN (Borge was a member) named Fonseca as Secretary General.\n\nIn January 1969, along with Ruiz, Borge was arrested for arms smuggling on the border with Costa Rica. Both are deported to Colombia; there begins a period of exile that took him to Cuba and Peru. In that time, he also visited the base of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon, passed by Mexico, and eventually returned to the ranks of the FSLN in Nicaragua.\n\nOn February 4, 1976, he was arrested again and sent to prison, where he was tortured. While in prison, the FSLN suffered several defeats and heavy losses. Fonseca perished in Zinica (Waslala, North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region of Nicaragua). Borge was in prison in Matagalpa; a colonel in the National Guard told him the news of Fonseca's death, to which Borge said\n\nIn August 1978, Borge was one of the highest ranking Sandinistas released from prison after the spectacular Sandinista raid (Operation Chanchera) on the Nicaraguan National Palace by 19 commandos, headed by Edén Pastora (Commander Zero) that took the entire Congress hostage.\n\nThe FSLN is divided into three factions and Tomás Borge lead the Prolonged Popular War fraction (GPP). On January 7, 1979, the FSLN came to an agreement on reunification, which was formalized in March, and Borge became one of the nine members of the National Directorate.\n\nThe triumphant guerrilla troops entered Managua on 19 July 1979. Days earlier, on July 11, Borge attended a meeting of the National Directorate along with Daniel Ortega, Sergio Ramirez and Miguel d' Escoto in Costa Rica at the home of President Rodrigo Carazo Odio in Puntarenas with William Boudlerom, representative of the US government. At that meeting, Borge rejected the proposal to replace Somoza with Urcuyos Maliaños Francisco, President of the Congress, as established in the Constitution of 1974 would take place in the absence of the president. Somoza fled on 17 July and Urcuyos was named president.\n\nNot too long after, Urcuyos was overthrown and power was passed to the Joint Government of National Reconstruction.\nOn July 19, 1979, FSLN troops entered Managua and proclaimed the Sandinista Revolution. Borge, reputed to be the most radical of the nine commanders of the Front, was a member of the National Directorate of the FSLN and took charge of the Ministry of Interior (overseeing the Sandinista Police, prisons, immigration, Directorate General of State Security and Fire), a position he maintained until the loss of the presidential election in February 1990.\n\nHis first task in office was the dissolution of the National Guard and the reviewing of the cases of former Somoza government officials. He also attempted to eliminate crimes (moderate and minor), vagrancy, gambling and drinking.\n\nTomás Borge was part of the first revolutionary government delegation which visited the Soviet Union on March 17, 1980. On the trip, he described the situation in his country as follows: \n\nOn July 19, 1981, in celebration of the third anniversary of the revolution, Borge reiterated that national unity, pluralism and a mixed economy were designed to strengthen, not to destabilize the revolutionary process. It was another warning to the opposition and entrepreneurs. At the same time, he ordered the dismissal of any officer who abused their authority.\n\nIn 1982, Tomás Borge was elected vicepresident of the Permanent Conference of Political Parties in Latin America, an association of social democratic, socialist, liberal and nationalist parties on the continent.\n\nAfter the electoral defeat of 1990, some members of the National Directorate abandoned politics, and the FSLN underwent a transformation into the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS). Borge and Bayardo Arce with Daniel Ortega were the only members who remained in the FSLN.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2002, he was a member of the Central American Parliament, Parlacén, and since 2001, a member of the National Assembly.\n\nIn the presidential elections held on November 5, 2006, the Sandinista candidate Daniel Ortega won with 38% of the vote. Borge increased his influence in the government. On March 22, 2007, at his request, he was appointed Ambassador of Nicaragua to Peru, where he served until his death. His appointment was seen as a retreat from political life.\n\nOn April 6, 2012, Borge entered the Military Hospital Alejandro Dávila Bolaños in Managua where he underwent a video-assisted thoracic surgery for a lung condition which had been progressing (according to some unofficial sources, he had cancer because he traveled to Cuba without being treated first). On April 9, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit after a respiratory complication developed while staying under medical supervision. On April 30, Rosario Murillo, coordinator of the Communication and Citizenship Council, published news of his death, which had occurred at 20:55 p.m. that night. At the time of his death, Tomás Borge was 81 and had continued staying active in politics as ambassador in Lima, Peru.\n\nBorge was the last survivor of the founders of the FSLN and one of its most important figures. Rosario Murillo said in reporting his death that Borge, as Borge had said of Carlos Fonseca, is \"among the dead that never die.\"\n\nOfficial acts were performed in his honor at the National Palace of Culture, former National Palace, where the chapel once stood. Tomás Borge was buried in the mausoleum of Carlos Fonseca, at the Revolution Square in Managua and the government decreed three days of national mourning.\n\nBorge was accused of exerting pressure against the Catholic Church hierarchy and accused it of siding with the Contras. Borge also established the censorship of the press, which was clarified after errors as well as compulsory military service.\n\nThe Misquitos accused Borge, among others, of the displacement and killing of those who opposed the Sandinista government, as told by the President of the Permanent Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States(OAS), Marcos Carmona, to the FSLN and opposition in the context of an election campaign. Another accusation against Borge was that he gave the order to kill 37 dissidents imprisoned in Granada during the first term of Ortega. He was charged, along with the rest of the Sandinista government, after the victory of Violeta Chamorro in 1990, of the \"Piñata Sandinista\", where they were accused of confiscating public properties. The charges were always rejected by Borge.\n\nHe created the Council of Sandinista Defense (CDS), like the Cuban's CDR, and the current Council of Citizen Power.\n\nHe founded the open prisons, where prisoners were without custody, and the women's prison \"La Esperanza\", a novelty in Nicaragua.\n\nIn an interview with the newspaper Nuevo Diario of Nicaragua for the 30th anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution, Borge said:\n\nHis first wife, Yelba Mayorga, was killed in 1979 during the guerrilla struggle and had a son. Later, he married Josephine Cerda and had several children with her. In 2007, he married the Peruvian actress Marcela Perez Silva and had three children with her.\n\nBorge was the author of several works of poetry, essays, and an autobiography. The Cuban poet Roberto Fernandez Retamar believes that Borge's book \"Carlos, el amanecer no es sólo un sueño\", which he wrote in prison, is comparable in literary merit to the documentary prose of Gabriel García Márquez.\n\nSome of his published titles are \"The Patient Impatience\", \"A Grain of Corn\", and \"The Anticipated Ceremony\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "957500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=957500", "title": "Valentin Glushko", "text": "Valentin Glushko\n\nValentin Petrovich Glushko (, \"Valentin Petrovich Glushko\"; , \"Valentyn Petrovych Hlushko\"; born 2 September 1908 – 10 January 1989), was a Soviet engineer, and designer of rocket engines during the Soviet/American Space Race.\n\nAt the age of fourteen he became interested in aeronautics after reading novels by Jules Verne. He is known to have written a letter to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1923. He studied at an Odessa trade school, where he learned to be a sheet metal worker. After graduation he apprenticed at a hydraulics fitting plant. He was first trained as a fitter, then moved to lathe operator.\n\nDuring his time in Odessa, Glushko performed experiments with explosives. These were recovered from unexploded artillery shells that had been left behind by the White Guards during their retreat. From 1924-25 he wrote articles concerning the exploration of the Moon, as well as the use of Tsiolkovsky's proposed engines for space flight.\n\nHe attended Leningrad State University where he studied physics and mathematics, but found the specialty programs were not to his interest. He reportedly left without graduating in April, 1929. From 1929-1930 he pursued rocket research at the Gas Dynamics Laboratory. A new research section was apparently set up for the study of liquid-propellant and electric engines. He became a member of the GIRD (Group for the study of Rocket Propulsion Systems), founded in Leningrad in 1931.\n\nOn 23 March 1938 he became caught up in Joseph Stalin's Great Purge and was rounded up by the NKVD, to be placed in the Butyrka prison. By 15 August 1939 he was sentenced to eight years in the Gulag. Despite his supposed imprisonment, however, Glushko was put to work on various aircraft projects with other arrested scientists. In 1941 he was placed in charge of a design bureau for liquid-fueled rocket engines. He was finally released in 1944 by special decree. In 1944, Sergei Korolev and Glushko designed the RD-1  auxiliary rocket motor tested in a fast-climb Lavochkin La-7R for protection of the capital from high-altitude \"Luftwaffe\" attacks.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Glushko was sent to Germany and Eastern Europe to study the German rocket program. In 1946, he became the chief designer of his own bureau, the OKB 456, and remained at this position until 1974. This bureau would play a prominent role in the development of rocket engines within the Soviet Union.\n\nHis OKB 456 (later NPO Energomash) would design the 35-metric ton (340 kN) thrust RD-101 engine used in the R-2, the 120-ton (1,180 kN) thrust RD-110 employed in the R-3, and the 44-ton (430 kN) thrust RD-103 used in the R-5 Pobeda (SS-3 Shyster). The R-7 (\"Semyorka\") would include four of Glushko's RD-107 engines and one RD-108. In 1954, he began to design engines for the R-12 Dvina (SS-4 Sandal), which had been designed by Mikhail Yangel. He also became responsible for supplying rocket engines for Sergei Korolev, the designer of the R-9 Desna (SS-8 Sasin). Among his designs was the powerful RD-170 liquid propellant engine.\n\nIn 1974, following the successful American moon landings, premier Leonid Brezhnev decided to cancel the troubled Soviet program to send a man to the Moon. He consolidated the Soviet space program, moving Vasily Mishin's OKB-1 (Korolev's former design bureau), as well as other bureaus, into a single bureau headed by Glushko, later named NPO Energia. Glushko's first act, after firing Mishin altogether, was to cancel the N-1 rocket, a program he had long criticized, despite the fact that one of the reasons for its difficulties was his own refusal to design the high power engines Korolev needed because of friction between the two men and ostensibly a disagreement over the use of cryogenic or hypergolic fuel.\n\nIn 1965, after the UR-500 booster began flying, the Chelomei Bureau offered a counterproposal to Korolev's N-1 in the UR-700, a Saturn V-class booster with nine F-1 sized engines powered by dinitrogen tetroxide and UDMH. Korolev was an outspoken opponent of hypergolic propellants due to their toxicity, often citing the 1960 Nedelin catastrophe as evidence of the danger posed by them, and had also objected to the UR-500 for the same reason.\n\nGlushko meanwhile was an advocate of Chelomei's UR-700 as well as an even more powerful UR-900 with a nuclear-powered upper stage. When Korolev continued protesting about the safety risk posed by hypergolic propellants, Glushko responded with the counterargument that the US was launching the manned Gemini spacecraft atop a Titan II rocket with very similar propellants and it was not apparently a safety issue for them. He also argued that the N-1 was not a workable solution because they could not develop RP-1/LOX engines on the scale of the Saturn F-1. When Korolev also suggested developing a liquid hydrogen engine for the N-1, Glushko said that LH2 was completely impractical as a rocket fuel. Korolev's protests that the US was already using them on the Centaur stage and would soon be flying Saturn boosters with LH2 upper stages got nowhere.\n\nThe UR-700, Glushko said, could enable a direct-ascent trajectory to the Moon which he considered safer and more reliable than the rendezvous-and-dock approach used by the Apollo program and Korolev's N-1 proposals. He also imagined the UR-700 and 900 in all sorts of applications from lunar bases to manned Mars missions to outer planet probes to orbiting battle stations.\n\nWhen Korolev died in January 1966, his deputy Vasily Mishin took over the OKB-1 design bureau. Mishin succeeded in getting the Kremlin to terminate the UR-700/900 project as well as the RD-270 engine Glushko planned for the launch vehicle family. His main arguments were the tremendous safety risk posed by a low-altitude launch failure of the UR-700 in addition to the waste of money by developing two HLV families at once.\n\nAfter the complete failure of the Soviet manned lunar effort, unmanned Mars missions, and the deaths of four cosmonauts, Mishin was fired in 1973 and the Kremlin decided to consolidate the entire Soviet space program into one organization headed by Glushko.\n\nOne of Glushko's first acts was to suspend the N-1 program, which however was not formally terminated until 1976. He then began work on a completely new HLV. During this time, the US was developing the Space Shuttle and Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev had been told that the Shuttle was actually being constructed as an orbiting weapon system that could drop a nuclear bomb onto Moscow, bypassing all Soviet detection systems. Although the rumor was completely false, Brezhnev believed it anyway and ordered the development of a Soviet Space Shuttle.\n\nBecause the Soviets lacked expertise in large solid rocket motors, Glushko decided that the new HLV would use entirely liquid-fueled engines, with an LH2 core stage taking the place of the Shuttle main engines and strap-on boosters with LOX/RP-1 engines, an ironic situation given his opposition to those propellants years earlier.\n\nWhile the RD-120 engine used for the Energia core stage was developed quickly and with little difficulty, the RD-170 proved harder to work out. As Soviet manufacturing technology was still not up to the task of building an F-1 class engine, Glushko instead decided to use an engine with four combustion chambers fed from a single propellant feed line. The RD-170 powered strap-on boosters designed for Energia became the basis for the Zenit booster family which began flying in 1985. Since the Buran space shuttle was not ready for operations, Energia's maiden flight in May 1987 carried aloft a prototype space station module called Polyus. Ultimately, Buran did fly the following summer, a few months before Glushko's death.\n\nWhile Energia and Buran fell victim to loss of funding after the collapse of the USSR, the RD-170 engines and its derivatives are still flying today and the experience in LH2 engines made during the Energia project would be used in later upper stages such as Briz.\n\nGlushko's team was part of the Soviet Ministry of General Machine Building headed by Minister Sergey Afanasyev. Before his death, he appointed Boris Gubanov to become his successor.\n\nGlushko died in January 1989. His obituary was signed by multiple Communist Party of the Soviet Union leaders, including Mikhail Gorbachev and it was only following his death that Glushko's efforts became known to most of the Soviet populace.\n\nFor many years Glushko had worked in Korolev's shadow, and certainly never received the credit he deserved (at the time) for his contributions. He was reputed to be obstinate and egotistical. \n\nPerhaps his most significant engineering failure, as noted by division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen fuel was unsuitable for use as a rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F-1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better specific impulse when compared to the F-1 engine. In addition, the RD-270 used the very advanced full-flow, staged, closed-cycle combustion concept as opposed to the simple open-cycle gas generator design used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N-1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion since Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia super heavy-lift launch vehicle, and is probably the finest example of Glushko's technical abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of Vasily Mishin and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program is a testament to the paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.\n\n\n\n\n"}
