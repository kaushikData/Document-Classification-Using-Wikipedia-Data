He was the Attorney General of Malaysia from 2002 to 2015, the first from Sabah to hold the position (hailing from Lahad Datu and was born in Lahad Datu district).\n\nAbdul Gani was the lead prosecutor in former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's sodomy trial of 1998.\n\nAbdul Gani Patail graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (Hons) degree from the University of Malaya in 1979. He began his legal career the following year as a Deputy Public Prosecutor (the title for a prosecuting officer in Malaysia) in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. In 1985, he was promoted to Senior Federal Counsel for Sabah.\n\nIn January 1994, Abdul Gani moved to the Attorney General's Chambers in Kuala Lumpur. There he was appointed Head of the Prosecution Division (1994 and again in 2000), Head of the Advisory and International Division (1995) and Commissioner of Law Revision (1997).\n\nOn 1 January 2002, he was appointed Attorney General of Malaysia.\n\nAbdul Gani's tenure as Attorney General ended in 2015 when the Chief Secretary to the Government announced he had stepped down due to health reasons. The announcement was abrupt, and Patail himself was apparently unaware of the decision to have him removed from his post. Prior to this, he was head of a multi-agency taskforce investigating claims of misappropriation of funds allegedly involving prime minister Najib Razak.\n\nIt was during his time as Commissioner of Law Revision that Abdul Gani was chosen to lead the prosecution against Anwar Ibrahim during Anwar's corruption and sodomy trial of 1998. Anwar was sentenced to a combined 15 years in prison for corruption and sodomy in April 1999 and August 2000 respectively. The sodomy conviction was overturned in 2004 by the Federal Court.\n\nAnwar has personally accused Abdul Gani and then Assistant Commissioner of Police Musa Hassan of fabricating evidence against him during the trial, in particular introducing the medical report that suggested Anwar's black-eye sustained from beatings in prison were self-inflicted. His claims have been backed by former police officer Mat Zain Ibrahim who investigated the 'black eye' incident.\n\n"}

{"id": "771190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=771190", "title": "Alan Hale (astronomer)", "text": "Alan Hale (astronomer)\n\nAlan Hale (born March 7, 1958) is an American professional astronomer, best known for his co-discovery of Comet Hale–Bopp along with amateur astronomer Thomas Bopp.\n\nHale specializes in the study of sun-like stars and the search for extra-solar planetary systems, and has side interests in the fields of comets and near-Earth asteroids. He has been an active astronomer most of his life and currently serves as the president of the Earthrise Institute, which he founded, and which has as its mission the use of astronomy as a tool for breaking down international and intercultural barriers.\n\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) has named an asteroid in Hale's honor, 4151 Alanhale, in recognition of his numerous comet observations.\n\nHale was born in 1958 in Tachikawa, Japan, where his father was serving in the United States Air Force. Four months later his father was transferred to Holloman Air Force Base outside Alamogordo, New Mexico.\n\nHale was raised in Alamogordo where his father retired from the Air Force and worked in civil service. In 2013 Hale said, \"I refuse to say that 'I grew up there' because anyone who know me knows that I really haven’t grown up yet.\"\nHe credits several factors for inspiring his interest in science and astronomy in the 1960s: the clear night skies in Alamogordo, library books on astronomy his father gave him in the first grade, the US space program, and the original Star Trek TV series. Hale also said that as a child he was interested in other sciences as well, and he \"went through a dinosaur phase when I was in 2nd grade. I knew them all. Drove my parent nuts.\"\nHale graduated from Alamogordo High School in 1976, and then served in the United States Navy from 1976 to 1983. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1980 with a bachelor's degree in physics.\nFollowing his Navy service he worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) until 1986 as an engineering contractor for Allied Bendix Aerospace working on the Deep Space Network project, as well as on several spacecraft projects. During the 1986 Voyager 2 fly-by of Uranus, he worked with the Radio Science Experiment, using the spacecraft carrier signal to deduce information about Uranus’ atmosphere and rings.\n\nFollowing the Uranus encounter, Hale enrolled in the Astronomy department of New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, where he earned a Master's Degree and a Ph.D. in 1989 and 1992 respectively, both in astronomy. His doctoral dissertation was published in the January 1994 issue of The Astronomical Journal.\nAfter earning his doctorate, Hale worked at The Space Center (now the New Mexico Museum of Space History) in Alamogordo, New Mexico, as its staff astronomer and outreach education coordinator.\n\nIn 1993 Hale founded the Southwest Institute for Space Research (SWISR), which later became the Earthrise Institute, where Hale serves as president.\n\nHale said \"there is an entire generation that has come of age having never really seen the dark sky\", so part of what he wanted to accomplish with Earthrise was \"to create an environment where students could spend some nights out under a dark sky and see what it really looks like.\"\n\nIn 1999 Hale assembled a group of American scientists, students and educators to go on a 2 week+ trip to Iran (coinciding with a solar eclipse) where they gave talks throughout the country. Hale feels that \"Science is a... universal language\" and \"it would be a great idea if we could use science as a tool to bring people together... to break down barriers between nations and between cultures.\" Hale uses the expression 'Science Diplomacy' in this context, which he says it's possible he coined. \"The sky looks the same from Iran as it does from here in the US. It’s the same sky we study... Science does not know political boundaries.\"\n\nThis sentiment is reflected in the mission of his Earthrise Institute, which is \"to use astronomy, space, and other related endeavors as a tool for breaking down international and intercultural barriers and for bringing humanity together.\" Earthrise's inaugural educational project was announced in a press release on March 1, 2007:\nHale remains active with the Earthrise Institute performing science outreach. For example, his \"In Our Skies\" column appears in the Alamogordo Daily News, in which he discusses current astronomical issues.\n\nHale first spotted the comet that would come to bear his name from his home in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, where the night sky is exceptionally dark. Since 1970 Hale had observed over 200 known comets, and on the night of July 22–23, 1995, after finishing his observations of periodic Comet Clark, and while waiting for periodic Comet d'Arrest to become visible above the horizon, he \"decided to pass the time by observing some deep-sky objects in Sagittarius\", and pointed his Meade DS-16 telescope towards globular cluster M70. He \"immediately noticed a fuzzy object in the field\" which wasn't present when he had observed that region of the sky two weeks earlier.\nAfter consulting his astronomical sources, and determining that the comet was likely unknown, Hale says: \nUnknown to Hale, that night Thomas Bopp was observing the same region of the sky with friends near Stanfield, Arizona. At around 11:00 pm, Bopp was observing M70 through his telescope and \"noticed a fainter, fuzzy object coming into the field\". Bopp and his friends followed the object for the next hour, and after seeing it move relative to the background stars, concluded that they had been viewing a comet. Bopp then drove back to his home in Glendale, and sent a telegram to the Central Bureau informing them of the comet.\nOn July 23, the IAU issued Circular 6187 to announce the joint discovery of the new comet. Per Hale, calculations indicate that Hale–Bopp likely last appeared on the order of 4000 years ago, but any record of this previous encounter had not yet been positively identified from ancient records. It has also been determined that Hale–Bopp will not return to the inner solar system until approximately 4385.\n\nComet Hale–Bopp, originally labeled C/1995 O1, and sometimes called \"the Great Comet of 1997\", became one of the most-viewed comets in human history, and the brightest comet seen since Comet West in 1976, appearing 1000 times brighter than Comet Halley did at the same distance.\n\nWhen the comet was at the peak of its brightness, Hale says he was giving talks about the comet in big cities with light-polluted night skies, so he did not get a chance \"to see it all that much when it was really bright.\"\n\nRegarding the press conference of the comet’s discovery, Hale praised the reporting done by “the very first reporter that broke the story of the comet’s discovery,” the Albuquerque Journal’s science reporter John Fleck:\n\nAs an example of the media getting it wrong, Hale told this story:\nHistorically linked to the discovery and first recorded appearance of Hale–Bopp is Heaven's Gate. This was a religious cult in San Diego, California led by Marshall Applewhite who preached that an alien spacecraft was following Comet Hale–Bopp. The cult members believed that transporting their souls to the spacecraft and evacuating the Earth – which was soon to be \"recycled\" – would permit them to achieve salvation. Applewhite and 38 followers poisoned themselves over three days in March 1997 in the belief this would allow them to pass through \"Heaven's Gate\" and achieve \"the Evolutionary Level Above Human.\" The rationale for taking their lives was (and is, as of this writing) clearly detailed on the group's website which is maintained by surviving cult members.\n\nWhen news broke of the Heaven's Gate mass suicides and their relation to Comet Hale–Bopp, Hale's phone \"never stopped ringing the entire day.\" Hale did not respond until the next day, when he spoke at a press conference on the subject, only after he had researched details of the incident.\n\nAt the 20th annual convention of the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) in Tampa, Florida, in 1997 Hale was a featured speaker and discussed the suicides, calling their death pact and other religion-fostered violence \"another victory for ignorance and superstition.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Second World Skeptics Congress in Heidelberg, Germany on July 24, 1998:\nHale said that, well before Heaven's Gate, he had told a colleague:\nFollowing his discovery of Comet Hale–Bopp, Hale was in demand to speak about the comet bearing his name, and this gave him a platform to discuss Hale-Bopp as well as general astronomy and science. A small sample of his lectures, interviews, and other appearances is as follows:\n\n\nAs a scientific skeptic, Hale is a periodic contributor to \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine. One such article, titled \"An Astronomer’s Personal Statement on UFOs\", appeared in the March/April 1997 edition. In the article Hale stated:\nAfter an analysis of the claims of extraterrestrial visitation with regards to these three principles, Hale concluded: \nHale is an atheist and member of the honorary board of the online group Internet Infidels which has the mission of using the Internet to promote a view that supernatural forces or entities do not exist. Hale has made his position on religion clear:\nIn 1980 Alan Hale was awarded the Navy League of the United States prize in Applied Physics.\n\nIn 1991, years prior to his discovery of Hale–Bopp, the IAU named an asteroid, 4151 Alanhale, in Hale's honor in recognition of his numerous comet observations, stating that:\n\n\n\nFrom August 2002 to January 2003, Hale wrote a weekly newspaper column for the Space Frontier Foundation entitled \"In Our Skies,\" which has been archived online. He also wrote a monthly column entitled \"Hale to the Stars.\" Hale currently contributes to the Alamogordo Daily News with his \"in Our Skies\" column, covering a variety of astronomical and spaceflight topics.\n\nOther publications Hale has contributed to include \"Astronomy\", \"Skeptical Inquirer\", \"Free Inquiry\" and the \"McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology\".\n\n\n"}

His career spanned from 1930 until his death. During that time he was a \"memorable character player of faded Anglo-Scottish gentility, whimsically put-upon countenance, and sepulchral, sometimes minatory, laugh\".\n\nAfter studying chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, he was employed, between 1925 and 1930, as a lecturer in elocution at New College, Edinburgh, and also established his own school of drama and speech training. In 1930 he made his professional stage debut as a messenger in \"Othello\" at the Savoy Theatre, London—with Paul Robeson and Peggy Ashcroft in the lead roles. During the next five years he appeared on stage in New York and the UK, and spent two years at the Old Vic.\n\nIn 1935 he made his film debut, appearing in \"The Riverside Murder\" (dir. Albert Parker); he appeared in four films that year, and five the following. His film career progressed and by the mid 1940s he was a well-known figure in the theatre and cinema. \"The Times\" highlighted some of his more notable films, including \"Green for Danger\" (1946), \"The Happiest Days of Your Life\" (1950), \"Scrooge\" (1951), \"An Inspector Calls\" (1954), \"The Green Man\" (1956) and \"School for Scoundrels\" (1960).\n\nSim had been Rector of the University of Edinburgh in 1951, and was awarded CBE in 1953, although he turned down a knighthood that was offered to him by Edward Heath. His biographer, Bruce Babington, considered that \"Sim was the paradigm – authority figure, yes, but often shadily duplicitous, often a manipulator of official rhetoric, his sexless bachelor persona containing strains of sexual ambiguity, his jolliness a latent vampirism.\" Sim died in August 1976.\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\n"}

The artist Joshua Shaw designed what is recognized today as the percussion cap, which he patented in the United States in 1822, since Forsyth had threatened his rivals in Britain with legal action. These new forms of ignition proved popular among hunters during the Regency period, who had their old reliable flintlocks converted.\n\nHe was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, and succeeded his father as minister of Belhelvie in 1791.\n\nWhile hunting wild duck, he was dissatisfied with his flintlock fowling-piece due to its long lock time (the delay between the time the trigger is pulled and the time the main charge of gunpowder begins burning); by the time the pellets actually left the barrel, the target animal could hear the noise from the trigger being pulled and have time to either fly, dive, or run before the shot reached it. He patented his scent-bottle lock in 1807; this was a small container filled with fulminate of mercury\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars Forsyth worked on his design at the Tower Armouries. But when a new Master General of Ordnance was appointed he was dismissed; other experiments had had destructive results and the new master general did not wish to see Britain's main arsenal destroyed.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte offered Forsyth a reward of £20,000 if he took his invention to France, but Forsyth declined. The French gunsmith Jean Lepage developed a similar form of ignition in 1807 based on Forsyth's design, but this was not pursued.\n"}

He began his acting career portraying Michael Kelso in the Fox sitcom \"That '70s Show\" (1998–2006). He made his film debut in the romantic comedy \"Coming Soon\" (1999) and became known by audiences in the comedy film \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" (2000), which was a box office hit. In 2003, Kutcher moved into romantic comedies, appearing in that year's \"Just Married\" and \"My Boss's Daughter\". In 2003, he created and produced the television series \"Punk'd\", also serving as host for the first eight of its ten seasons. In 2004, Kutcher starred in the lead role of the psychological film \"The Butterfly Effect\".\n\nKutcher subsequently appeared in more romantic comedies, including \"Guess Who\" (2005), \"A Lot Like Love\" (2005), \"What Happens in Vegas\" (2008), and \"No Strings Attached\" (2011). He starred as Walden Schmidt on the CBS sitcom \"Two and a Half Men\" (2011–2015). In 2013, Kutcher portrayed Steve Jobs in the biographical film \"Jobs.\" Since 2016, he has starred as Colt Bennett in the Netflix series \"The Ranch\".\n\nBeyond entertainment, Kutcher is also a venture capitalist. He is a co-founder of the venture capital firm A-Grade Investments. At SXSW on March 14, 2015, Kutcher announced Sound Ventures, the successor to A-Grade Investments managing a fund backed by institutional funding. Kutcher has also successfully invested in several high technology startups. Kutcher has investments in over 60 companies, the most prominent of which include Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb, Path and Fab.com. Kutcher has invested in five startups as of August 2017 - Neighborly, Zenreach, ResearchGate, Kopari Beauty, and Lemonade, marking his foray into the \"insurtech\" sector.\n\nKutcher was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Diane (\"née\" Finnegan), a Procter & Gamble employee, and Larry M. Kutcher, a factory worker. He has Czech, German, and Irish ancestry.\n\nKutcher was raised in a \"relatively conservative\" Catholic family. He has an older sister named Tausha and a fraternal twin brother named Michael, who had a heart transplant when the brothers were young children. Michael also has cerebral palsy and is a spokesperson for the advocacy organization Reaching for the Stars. Michael's cardiomyopathy caused Kutcher's home life to become increasingly stressful. He has said he \"didn't want to come home and find more bad news\" about his brother, stating, \"I kept myself so busy that I didn't allow myself to feel.\"\nKutcher attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids for his freshman year, before his family moved to Homestead, Iowa, where he attended Clear Creek Amana High School. During high school, he developed a passion for acting and appeared in school plays. His home life worsened when his parents divorced when he was 16. During his senior year, he broke into his high school at midnight with his cousin in an attempt to steal money; he was arrested leaving the scene. Kutcher was convicted of third-degree burglary and sentenced to three years of probation and 180 hours of community service. Kutcher stated that although the experience \"straightened him out\", he lost his girlfriend and anticipated college scholarships, and was ostracized at school and in his community.\n\nKutcher enrolled at the University of Iowa in August 1996, where his planned major was biochemical engineering, motivated to the desire to find a cure for his brother's heart ailment. At college, Kutcher was kicked out of his apartment for being too \"noisy\" and \"wild\". Kutcher stated, \"I thought I knew everything but I didn't have a clue. I was partying, and I woke up many mornings not knowing what I had done the night before. I played way too hard. I am amazed I am not dead.\" To earn money for his tuition, Kutcher worked as a college summer hire in the cereal department for the General Mills plant in Cedar Rapids, and sometimes sold his blood. While at the University of Iowa, he was approached by a model scout at a bar called The Airliner in Iowa City, Iowa, and was recruited to enter the \"Fresh Faces of Iowa\" modeling competition. After placing first, he dropped out of college and won a trip to New York City to the International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Convention. After his stay in New York City, Kutcher returned to Cedar Rapids, before relocating to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.\n\nAfter participating in an IMTA competition in 1998, Kutcher signed with Next modeling agency in New York, appeared in commercials for Calvin Klein, and modelled in Paris and Milan.\n\nFollowing his success in modeling, Kutcher moved to Los Angeles after his first audition. He was cast as Michael Kelso in the television series \"That '70s Show\", from 1998 to 2006. Kutcher was cast in a series of film roles; although he auditioned but was not cast for the role of Danny Walker in \"Pearl Harbor\" (2001) (replaced by Josh Hartnett), he starred in several comedy films, including \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" (2000), \"Just Married\" (2003), and \"Guess Who\" (2005). He appeared in the 2003 family film \"Cheaper By The Dozen\" as a self-obsessed actor. In the 2004 drama film \"The Butterfly Effect\", Kutcher played a conflicted young man who time travels. The film received mixed to negative reviews, but was a box office success.\n\nIn 2003, Kutcher produced and starred as the host in his own series, MTV's \"Punk'd\", that involved hidden camera tricks performed on celebrities. He is also an executive producer of the reality television shows \"Beauty and the Geek\", \"Adventures in Hollyhood\" (based around the rap group Three 6 Mafia), \"The Real Wedding Crashers\", and the game show \"Opportunity Knocks\". Many of his production credits, including \"Punk'd\", come through Katalyst Films, a production company he runs with partner Jason Goldberg. A 2004 interviewer described Kutcher as a \"hunky young actor [who] is heading in all different directions at once\", including \"the hot L.A. restaurant Dolce\":\n\n\"If anything, I'm a trier,\" says Kutcher between puffs of filtered Lucky Strikes. \"I think, more than anything, it comes from the fact that my father always had several irons in the fire. Also, I don't want to fail. If something doesn't work out—if \"That '70s Show\" got canceled or if I wasn't going to have a film career—I always wanted to have backup contingency plans. So I just started doing other things; and on a half-hour sitcom, you're really only working for 30 hours a week. It allows a lot of time for sitting around, which I always kind of filled with work.\n\nBecause of scheduling conflicts with the filming of \"The Guardian\", Kutcher was unable to renew his contract for the eighth and final season of \"That '70s Show\", although he appeared in its first four episodes (credited as a special guest star) and returned for the series finale. Kutcher produced and starred in the 2010 action comedy, \"Killers\", in which he played a hitman. In May 2011, Kutcher was announced as Charlie Sheen's replacement on the series \"Two and a Half Men\".\n\nKutcher's contract was for one year and was believed to be worth nearly $20 million. His debut as the character Walden Schmidt, entitled \"Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt\", was seen by 28.7 million people on September 19, 2011. The Nielsen ratings company reported that figure was more than any episode in the show's first eight seasons, when Sheen starred in it. Kutcher earned $750,000 an episode on the show. The show ended with a forty-minute series finale \"Of Course He's Dead\" on February 19, 2015.\n\nKutcher appeared as a guest Shark during the seventh season of reality TV show \"Shark Tank\", which premiered on September 25, 2015.\n\nIn 2016, he appeared in the 'Candy, Quahog Marshmallow' episode of \"Family Guy\".\n\nSince 2016, he has starred in the Netflix series, \"The Ranch\", alongside Danny Masterson, Elisha Cuthbert and Debra Winger, playing the role of Colt Bennett, the son of a Colorado rancher (Sam Elliott) returning home from a semi-pro football career to run the family business on the ranch.\n\nBeyond the entertainment world, Kutcher has invested in several high technology startups. Kutcher has investments in over 60 companies, the most prominent of which include Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb, Path and Fab.com. Kutcher has invested in five startups as of August 2017 - Neighborly, Zenreach, ResearchGate, Kopari Beauty, and most recently, Lemonade, marking his foray into the \"insurtech\" sector.\n\nHe is a co-founder of the venture capital firm A-Grade Investments with Guy Oseary and Ron Burkle and fund manager Chris Hollod. At SXSW on March 14, 2015, Kutcher announced Sound Ventures, the successor to A-Grade Investments managing a fund backed by institutional funding.\n\nOn October 29, 2013, Lenovo announced that it hired Kutcher as product engineer. Kutcher was part of the management team for Ooma, a tech start-up launched in September 2007. Ooma is in the Voice over Internet Protocol business and Kutcher's role was as Creative Director. He spearheaded a marketing campaign and produced viral videos to promote this service. Kutcher also created an interactive arm of Katalyst called Katalyst Media, with his partner from Katalyst Films, Jason Goldberg. Their first site was the animated cartoon \"Blah Girls\". Ooma revamped its sales and marketing strategy with a new management team in the summer of 2008, replacing Kutcher as their creative director. Rich Buchanan, from Sling Media, became Ooma's Chief Marketing Officer.\n\nKutcher has invested in an Italian restaurant, Dolce (other owners include Danny Masterson and Wilmer Valderrama) and a Japanese-themed restaurant named Geisha House with locations in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. Geisha House went out of business on June 1, 2013.\n\nIn 2009, Kutcher established an international human rights organization with his then-wife Demi Moore. DNA Foundation, later known as Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children, works to address the sexual exploitation of children and the proliferation of child pornography on a global scale. On March 23, 2011, Kutcher launched his own Twitter client with UberMedia called A.plus. While the app was initially available exclusively for desktop computers with Adobe Air installed, it eventually became available on mobile platforms, for iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry. In order to download on one of the 3 mobile platforms, users must first have the UberSocial client installed on their device and then proceed to the device's browser to download A.plus.\n\nIn 2013, Kutcher teamed up with Evan Beard and Kendall Dabaghi to launch A Plus, where Kutcher is currently Chairman of the Board. Initially a product discovery service, it morphed in April 2014 to a social media-driven content platform focused on upbeat stories. It was officially launched in that incarnation in January 2015. It has reported 27.5 million monthly uniques in the United States, has an Alexa rank of about 11787 (4019 in the US), and is ranked by Quantcast as a top 50 site in the US in terms of unique visitors.\n\nAshton Kutcher received widespread criticism for his appearance in a Popchips ad campaign in May 2012. The campaign featured Kutcher as an Indian man \"looking for love\" in a dating ad-style spoof. Kutcher's use of brown face paint and a stereotypical Indian accent received backlash from online viewers and members of the Indian-American community.\n\nKutcher and actress Demi Moore married on September 24, 2005. Six years later, on November 17, 2011, Moore announced her intention to end the marriage. After more than a year of separation, Kutcher filed for divorce from Moore on December 21, 2012, in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on November 27, 2013.\n\nKutcher began dating his former \"That '70s Show\" co-star Mila Kunis during the first half of 2012. After they became engaged in February 2014, she gave birth to their daughter Wyatt in October 2014. Kunis married Kutcher in July 2015. She gave birth to a son named Dimitri Portwood in November 2016.\n\nKutcher describes himself as a fiscal conservative and social liberal. He is a gun owner, however, he supports new gun laws to help stop mass shootings, including banning military styled semi-automatic rifles. Following the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, he said on his Twitter \"I've had a gun since I was 12 yrs old but enough is enough. I'm a hunter and a sportsman but No body needs [Assault rifles]. Let's pray. Then let's change the law.\"\n\nHe trains in the martial art Brazilian jiu-jitsu. He is currently a purple belt under Rigan Machado.\n\nOn September 17, 2008, Kutcher was named the assistant coach for the freshman football team at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles. However, he was unable to return in 2009 because he was filming \"Spread\".\n\nIn February 2011, Kutcher sold his Hollywood Hills home, which he originally bought in 2004.\n\nKutcher, a Roman Catholic, has visited Israel and studied the Kabbalah. His \"No Strings Attached\" co-star, Natalie Portman, stated in 2011 that Kutcher \"has taught me more about Judaism than I think I have ever learned from anyone else\". On trips to Israel, Kutcher visited Kabbalah centers in Tel Aviv and in Tsfat. In 2013, Kutcher remarked, \"Israel is near and dear to my heart ... coming to Israel is sort of coming back to the source of creation – trying to get closer to that. And as a creative person, going to the source of creation is really inspiring.

{"id": "449749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449749", "title": "Bruce Chatwin", "text": "Bruce Chatwin\n\nCharles Bruce Chatwin (13 May 194018 January 1989) was an English travel writer, novelist, and journalist. His first book, \"In Patagonia\" (1977), established Chatwin as a travel writer, although he considered himself instead a storyteller, interested in bringing to light unusual tales. He won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel \"On the Black Hill\" (1982), while his novel \"Utz\" (1988) was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. In 2008 \"The Times\" named Chatwin number 46 on their list of \"50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945.\"\n\nChatwin was born in Sheffield, England. After completing his secondary education at Marlborough College, he went to work at the age of 18 at Sotheby's in London, where he gained an extensive knowledge of art and eventually ran the auction house’s Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. In 1966 he left Sotheby’s to read archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, but he abandoned his studies after two years to pursue a career as a writer.\n\n\"The Sunday Times Magazine\" hired Chatwin in 1972. He travelled the world for work and interviewed figures such as the politicians Indira Gandhi and André Malraux. He left the magazine in 1974 to visit Patagonia, which resulted in his first book. He produced five other books, including \"The Songlines\" (1987), about Australia, which was a bestseller. His work is credited with reviving the genre of travel writing, and his works influenced other writers such as William Dalrymple, Claudio Magris, Philip Marsden, Luis Sepúlveda, and Rory Stewart.\n\nMarried and bisexual, Chatwin was one of the first prominent men in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV and to have died of an AIDS-related illness, although he hid the details. Following his death, some members of the gay community criticised Chatwin for keeping his diagnosis secret.\n\nBruce Chatwin was born on 13 May 1940 in the Shearwood Road Nursing Home in Sheffield, England, to Margharita (\"née\" Turnell) and Charles Chatwin. His mother, Margharita, had grown up in Sheffield and worked for the local Conservative party prior to her marriage. His father, Charles, was a lawyer from Birmingham who joined the Royal Naval Reserve following the outbreak of World War II.\n\nChatwin's early years were spent moving regularly with his mother while his father was at sea. Prior to his birth, Chatwin's parents had lived at Barnt Green, Worcestershire, but Margharita moved to her parents' house in Dronfield, near Sheffield, shortly before giving birth. Mother and son remained there for only a few weeks. Worried about Nazi bombs, Margharita sought a safer place to stay. She took her son with her as they travelled to stay with various relatives during the war. They would remain in one place until Margharita decided to move, either because of concern for their safety, or because of friction among family members. Later in life Chatwin recalled of the war, \"Home, if we had one, was a solid black suitcase called the Rev-Robe, in which there was a corner for my clothes and my Mickey Mouse gas mask.\"\n\nDuring the war Chatwin and his mother stayed at the home of his paternal grandparents, who had a curiosity cabinet that fascinated him. Among the items it contained was a \"piece of brontosaurus\" (actually a mylodon, a giant sloth), which had been sent to Chatwin's grandmother by her cousin Charles Milward. Travelling in Patagonia, Milward had discovered the remains of a giant sloth, which he later sold to the British Museum. He sent his cousin a piece of the animal's skin, and members of the family mistakenly referred to it as a \"piece of brontosaurus\". The skin was later lost but it inspired Chatwin decades later to visit and write about Patagonia.\n\nAfter the war, Chatwin lived with his parents and younger brother Hugh (born in 1944) in West Heath in Birmingham, where his father had a law practice. At the age of seven he was sent to boarding school at Old Hall School in Shropshire, and then Marlborough College, in Wiltshire. An unexceptional student, he garnered attention from his performances in school plays. While at Marlborough, Chatwin attained A-levels in Latin, Greek, and Ancient History.\n\nChatwin had hoped to read Classics at Merton College, Oxford, but the end of National Service in the United Kingdom meant there was more competition for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered — an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya. Instead, Chatwin's father asked one of his clients for a letter of introduction to the auction house Sotheby's. An interview was arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.\n\nIn 1958, Chatwin moved to London to begin work as a porter in the Works of Art department at Sotheby's. Chatwin was ill-suited for this job, which included dusting objects that had been kept in storage. Sotheby's moved him to a junior cataloguer position working in both the Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. This position enabled him to develop his eye for art, and he quickly became known for his ability to discern forgeries. His work as a cataloguer also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required him to research these objects. Chatwin advanced to become Sotheby's expert on Antiquities and Impressionist art and would later run both departments. Many of Chatwin's colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of the auction house.\n\nDuring this period Chatwin travelled extensively for his job and also for adventure. Travel offered him a relief from the British class system, which he found stifling. An admirer of Robert Byron and his book, \"The Road to Oxiana\", he travelled twice to Afghanistan. He also used these trips to visit markets and shops where he would buy antiques which he would resell at a profit in order to supplement his income from Sotheby's. He became friends with artists and art collectors and dealers. One friend, Howard Hodgkin, painted Chatwin in \"The Japanese Screen\" (1962). Chatwin said he was the \"acid green smear on the left.\"\n\nChatwin was ambivalent about his sexual orientation and had affairs with both men and women during this period of his life. One of his girlfriends, Elizabeth Chanler, an American and a descendent of John Jacob Astor, was a secretary at Sotheby's. Chanler had earned a degree in history from Radcliffe College and worked at Sotheby's New York offices for two years before transferring to their London office in 1961. Her love of travel and independent nature appealed to Chatwin.\n\nIn the mid-1960s Chatwin grew unhappy at Sotheby's. There were various reasons for his disenchantment. Both women and men found Chatwin attractive, and Peter Wilson, then chairman of Sotheby's, used this appeal to the auction house's advantage when using Chatwin to try to persuade wealthy individuals to sell their art collections. Chatwin became increasingly uncomfortable with the situation. Later in life Chatwin also spoke of having become \"burnt out\" and said, \"In the end I felt I might just as well be working for a rather superior funeral parlour. One's whole life seemed to be spent valuing for probate the apartment of somebody recently dead.\"\n\nIn late 1964 he began to suffer from problems with his sight, which he attributed to the close analysis of art work entailed by his job. He consulted eye specialist Patrick Trevor-Roper, who diagnosed a latent squint and recommended that Chatwin take a six-month break from his work at Sotheby's. Trevor-Roper had been involved in the design of an eye hospital in Addis Ababa, and suggested Chatwin visit East Africa. In February 1965, Chatwin left for Sudan. It was on this trip that Chatwin first encountered a nomadic tribe; their way of life intrigued him. \"My nomadic guide,\" he wrote, \"carried a sword, a purse and a pot of scented goat's grease for anointing his hair. He made me feel overburdened and inadequate...\" Chatwin would remain fascinated by nomads for the rest of his life.\n\nChatwin returned to Sotheby's, and to the surprise of his friends, proposed marriage to Elizabeth Chanler. They married on 21 August 1965. Chatwin was bisexual throughout their married life, a circumstance Elizabeth knew and accepted. Chatwin had hoped he would \"grow out of\" his homosexual behaviour and have a successful marriage like his parents. During their marriage, Chatwin had many affairs, mostly with men. Some who were aware of Chatwin's affairs with men assumed the Chatwins had a chaste marriage, but according to Nicholas Shakespeare, the author's biographer, this was not true. Both Chatwin and his wife had hoped to have children, but they remained childless.\n\nIn April 1966, at the age of 26, Chatwin was promoted to a director of Sotheby's, a position to which he had aspired. To his disappointment, he was made a junior director and lacked voting rights on the board. This disappointment, along with boredom and increasing discomfort over potentially illegal side deals taking place at Sotheby's, including the sale of objects from the Pitt-Rivers museum collection, led Chatwin to resign from his Sotheby's post in June 1966.\n\nChatwin enrolled in October 1966 at the University of Edinburgh to study Archaeology. He had regretted not attending Oxford and had been contemplating going to university for a few years. A visit in December 1965 to the Hermitage in Leningrad sparked his interest in the field of archaeology. Despite winning the Wardrop Prize for the best first year's work, he found the rigour of academic archaeology tiresome, and he left after two years without taking a degree.\n\nFollowing his departure from Edinburgh, Chatwin decided to pursue a career as a writer, successfully pitching a book proposal on nomads to Tom Maschler, publisher at Jonathan Cape. Chatwin tentatively titled the book \"The Nomadic Alternative\" and sought to answer the question \"Why do men wander rather than stand still?\" Chatwin delivered the manuscript in 1972, and Maschler declined to publish it, calling it a \"chore to read\".\n\nBetween 1969 and 1972, as he was working on \"The Nomadic Alternative\", Chatwin travelled extensively and pursued other endeavours in an attempt to establish a creative career. He co-curated an exhibit on \"Nomadic Art of the Asian Steppes,\" which opened at Asia House Gallery in New York City in 1970. He considered publishing an account of his 1969 trip to Afghanistan with Peter Levi. Levi published his own book about it, \"The Light Garden of the Angel King: Journeys in Afghanistan\" (1972). Chatwin contributed two articles on nomads to \"Vogue\" and another article to \"History Today\".\n\nIn the early 1970s Chatwin had an affair with James Ivory, a film director. He pitched stories to him for possible films, which Ivory did not take seriously. In 1972 Chatwin tried his hand at film-making and travelled to Niger to make a documentary about nomads. The film was lost while Chatwin was trying to sell it to European television companies.\n\nChatwin also took photographs of his journeys and attempted to sell photographs from a trip to Mauritania to \"The Sunday Times Magazine.\" While \"The Times\" did not accept those photographs for publication, it did offer Chatwin a job.\n\nIn 1972, \"The Sunday Times Magazine\" hired Chatwin as an adviser on art and architecture. Initially his role was to suggest story ideas and put together features such as \"One Million Years of Art,\" which ran in several issues during the summer of 1973. His editor, Francis Wyndham, encouraged him to write, which allowed him to develop his narrative skills. Chatwin travelled on many international assignments, writing on such subjects as Algerian migrant workers and the Great Wall of China, and interviewing such diverse people as André Malraux, Maria Reiche, and Madeleine Vionnet.\n\nIn 1972, Chatwin interviewed the 93-year-old architect and designer Eileen Gray in her Paris salon, where he noticed a map she had painted of the area of South America called Patagonia. \"I've always wanted to go there,\" Chatwin told her. \"So have I,\" she replied, \"Go there for me.\"\n\nTwo years later, in November 1974, Chatwin flew out to Lima in Peru, and reached Patagonia a month later. He would later claim that he sent a telegram to Wyndham merely stating: \"Have gone to Patagonia.\" Actually he sent a letter: \"I am doing a story there for myself, something I have always wanted to write up.\" This marked the end of Chatwin's role as a regular writer for \"The Sunday Times Magazine\", although in subsequent years he contributed occasional pieces, including a profile of Indira Gandhi.\n\nChatwin spent six months in Patagonia, travelling around gathering stories of people who came from elsewhere and settled there. This trip resulted in the book, \"In Patagonia\" (1977). He used his quest for his own \"piece of brontosaurus\" (the one from his grandparents' cabinet had been thrown away years earlier) to frame the story of his trip. Chatwin described \"In Patagonia\" as \"the narrative of an actual journey and a symbolic one... It is supposed to fall into the category or be a spoof of Wonder Voyage: the narrator goes to a far country in search of a strange animal: on his way he lands in strange situations, people or other books tell him strange stories which add up to form a message.\"\n\n\"In Patagonia\" contains fifteen black and white photographs by Chatwin. According to Susannah Clapp, who edited the book, \"Rebecca West amused Chatwin by telling him that these were so good they rendered superfluous the entire text of the book.\"\n\nThis work established Chatwin's reputation as a travel writer. One of his biographers, Nicholas Murray, called \"In Patagonia\" \"one of the most strikingly original post-war English travel books\" and said that it revitalised the genre of travel writing. However, residents in the region contradicted the account of events depicted in Chatwin's book. It was the first time in his career, but not the last, that conversations and characters which Chatwin presented as fact were later alleged to be fiction.\n\nFor \"In Patagonia\" Chatwin received the Hawthornden Prize and the E. M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Graham Greene, Patrick Leigh Fermor, and Paul Theroux praised the book. As a result of the success of \"In Patagonia\", Chatwin's circle of friends expanded to include people like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Susan Sontag, and Jasper Johns.\n\nUpon his return from Patagonia, Chatwin discovered a change in leadership at \"The Sunday Times Magazine\" and his retainer was discontinued. Chatwin intended his next project to be a biography of Francisco Félix de Sousa, a 19th-century slave trader born in Brazil, who became the Viceroy of Ouidah in Dahomey. Chatwin had first heard of De Sousa during a visit to Dahomey in 1972. He returned to the country, by then renamed the People's Republic of Benin, in December 1976 to conduct research. In January 1977, during the 1977 Benin coup d'état attempt, Chatwin was accused of being a mercenary and detained for three days. Chatwin later wrote about this experience in \"A Coup — A Story,\" which was published in \"Granta\" and included in \"What Am I Doing Here?\" (1989).\n\nFollowing his arrest and release, Chatwin left Benin and went to Brazil to continue his research on de Sousa. Frustrated by the lack of documented information on de Sousa, Chatwin chose instead to write a fictionalised biography of him. This book was published in 1980, and Werner Herzog's film, \"Cobra Verde\" (1987), is based on it.\n\nAlthough \"The Viceroy of Ouidah\" received good reviews, it did not sell well. Nicholas Shakespeare said that the dismal sales caused Chatwin to pursue a completely different subject for his next book. In response to his growing reputation as a travel writer, Chatwin said he \"decided to write something about people who never went out.\" His next book, \"On the Black Hill\" (1982), is a novel of twin brothers who live all of their lives in a farmhouse on the Welsh borders. For this book Chatwin won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Whitbread Prize for Best First Novel, even though he considered his previous book, \"The Viceroy of Ouidah\", a novel. It was made into a film in 1987.\n\nIn the late 1970s Chatwin spent an increasing amount of time in New York City. He continued to have affairs with men, but most of these affairs were short-lived. In 1977 he began his first serious affair with Donald Richards, an Australian stockbroker. Richards introduced him to the gay nightclub scene in New York. During this period Chatwin became acquainted with Robert Mapplethorpe, who photographed him. Chatwin is one of the few men Mapplethorpe photographed fully clothed. Chatwin later contributed the introduction to a book of Mapplethorpe's photographs, \"Lady, Lisa Lyon\" (1983).\n\nAlthough Elizabeth Chatwin had accepted her husband's affairs, their relationship deteriorated in the late 1970s, and in 1980 she asked for a separation. By 1982 Chatwin's affair with Richards had ended and he began another serious affair with Jasper Conran.\n\nIn 1983 Chatwin returned to the topic of nomads and decided to focus on Aboriginal Australians. He was influenced by the work of Theodore Strehlow, a controversial figure who was the author of \"Songs of Central Australia\". Strehlow had collected and recorded Aboriginal songs, and shortly before his death in 1978, he sold photographs of secret Aboriginal initiation ceremonies to a magazine.\n\nChatwin went to Australia to learn more about Aboriginal culture, specifically the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be used as a metaphor to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled fully to understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information, as he was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.\nWhile in Australia, Chatwin, who had been experiencing some health problems, first read about AIDS, then known as the gay plague. It frightened him and compelled him to reconcile with his wife. The fear of AIDS also drove him to finish the book that became \"The Songlines\" (1987). His friend the novelist Salman Rushdie said, \"That book was an obsession too great for him... His illness did him a favour, got him free of it. Otherwise, he would have gone on writing it for ten years.\"\n\n\"The Songlines\" features a narrator named Bruce whose biography is almost identical to Chatwin's. The narrator spends time in Australia trying to learn about Aboriginal culture, specifically the songlines. As the book goes on, it becomes a reflection on what Chatwin stated was \"for me, the question of questions: the nature of human restlessness.\" Chatwin also hinted at his preoccupation over his own mortality in the text: \"I had a presentiment that the 'travelling' phase of my life might be passing... I should set down on paper a resume of the ideas, quotations, and encounters that amused me and obsessed me.\" Following this statement in \"The Songlines\" Chatwin included extensive excerpts from his moleskine notebooks.\n\nChatwin published \"The Songlines\" in 1987, and it became a bestseller in the United Kingdom and in the United States. The book was nominated for the Thomas Cook Travel Award, but Chatwin requested that it be withdrawn from consideration, saying the work was fictional. After its publication, Chatwin became friends with the composer Kevin Volans, who was inspired to base a theatre score on the book. The project evolved into an opera, \"The Man with Footsoles of Wind\" (1993).\n\nWhile at work on \"The Songlines\" between 1983 and 1986, Chatwin frequently came down with colds. He also developed skin lesions that may have been symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma. After finishing \"The Songlines\" in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed in the street. At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\nChatwin's case was unusual as he had a fungal infection, \"Penicillium marneffei\", which at the time had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV developed into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus — ranging from eating a thousand-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.\n\nAlthough Chatwin never spoke or wrote publicly about his disease, in one instance he did write about the AIDS epidemic in 1988 in a letter to the editor of the \"London Review of Books\":\n\nDuring his illness, Chatwin continued to write. Elizabeth encouraged him to use a letter he had written to her from Prague in 1967 as an inspiration for a new story. During this trip, he had met Konrad Just, an art collector. This meeting and the letter to Elizabeth served as the basis for Chatwin's next work. \"Utz\" (1988) was a novel about the obsession that leads people to collect. Set in Prague, the novel details the life and death of Kaspar Utz, a man obsessed with his collection of Meissen porcelain. \"Utz\" was well-received and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.\n\nChatwin also edited a collection of his journalism, which was published as \"What Am I Doing Here\" (1989). At the time of his death in 1989, he was working on a number of new ideas for future novels, including a transcontinental epic provisionally titled \"Lydia Livingstone\".\n\nChatwin died at a hospital in Nice on 18 January 1989. A memorial service was held at the Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Sophia in West London on 14 February 1989, the same day that a \"fatwa\" was announced on Salman Rushdie, a close friend of Chatwin's, who attended the service. Paul Theroux, who also attended the service, later commented on it and Chatwin in a piece for \"Granta\". The novelist Martin Amis described the memorial service in the essay \"Salman Rushdie\", included in his anthology \"Visiting Mrs Nabokov\".\n\nChatwin's ashes were scattered near a Byzantine chapel above Kardamyli in the Peloponnese. This was close to the home of one of his mentors, the writer Patrick Leigh Fermor. Chatwin had spent several months in 1985 near there, working on \"The Songlines\".\n\nChatwin's papers, including 85 moleskine notebooks, were given to the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Two collections of his photographs and excerpts from the moleskine notebooks were published as \"Photographs and Notebooks\" (US title: \"Far Journeys\") in 1993 and \"Winding Paths\" in 1999.\n\nNews of Chatwin's AIDS diagnosis first surfaced in September 1988, although the obituaries at the time of his death had referred to Chatwin's statements about a rare fungal infection. After his death, some members of the gay community criticised Chatwin for lack of courage to reveal the true nature of his illness, thinking he would have raised public awareness of AIDS, as he was one of the first high-profile individuals in Britain known to have contracted HIV.\n\nJohn Updike described Chatwin's writing as \"a clipped, lapidary prose that compresses worlds into pages\", while one of Chatwin's editors, Susannah Clapp, wrote, \"Although his syntax was pared down, his words were not — or at least not only — plain... His prose is both spare and flamboyant.\"\nChatwin's writing was shaped by his work as a cataloguer at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice in writing concise, yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, his writing was influenced by his interest in nomads. One aspect that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their Spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and he sought to emulate it in his life and his writing, striving to strip needless objects from his life and needless words from his prose.\n\nChatwin experimented with format in his writing. With \"In Patagonia\", Clapp said Chatwin described the book's structure of 97 vignettes as \"Cubist.\" \"[I]n other words,\" she said, \"lots of small pictures tilting away and toward each other to create this strange original portrait of Patagonia.\" \"The Songlines\" was another attempt by Chatwin to experiment with format. It begins as a novel narrated by a man named Bruce, but about two-thirds of the way through it becomes a commonplace book filled with quotations, anecdotes, and summaries of others' research, in an attempt to explore restlessness. Some of Chatwin's critics did not think he succeeded in \"The Songlines\" with this approach, but others applauded his effort at an unconventional structure.\n\nSeveral 19th and 20th-century writers influenced Chatwin's work. He admitted to imitating the work of Robert Byron when he first began making notes of his travels. While in Patagonia he read \"In Our Time\" by Ernest Hemingway, whom he admired for his spare prose. While writing \"In Patagonia\", Chatwin strove to approach his writing as a \"literary Cartier-Bresson.\" Chatwin's biographer described the resulting prose as \"quick snapshots of ordinary people\". Along with Hemingway and Cartier-Bresson, Osip Mandelstam's work strongly influenced Chatwin during the writing of \"In Patagonia\". An admirer of Noël Coward, Chatwin found the breakfast scene in \"Private Lives\" helpful in learning to write dialogue. Once Chatwin began work on \"The Viceroy of Ouidah\", he began studying the work of 19th-century French authors such as Honoré de Balzac and Gustave Flaubert, who would continue to influence him for the rest of his life.\n\nChatwin explored several different themes in his work: human restlessness and wandering; borders and exile; and art and objects. He\nconsidered human restlessness to be the focus of his writing. He ultimately aspired to explore the subject in order to answer what he saw as a fundamental question of human existence. He thought humans were meant to be a migratory species, and once they settled in one place, their natural urges \"found outlets in violence, greed, status-seeking or a mania for the new.\" In his first attempt at writing a book, \"The Nomadic Alternative\", Chatwin had tried to compose an academic exposition on nomadic culture, which he believed was unexamined and unappreciated. With this, Chatwin had hoped to discover: \"Why do men wander rather than sit still?\" In his book proposal he admitted that the interest in the subject was personal: \"Why do I become restless after a month in a single place, unbearable after two?\"\n\nAlthough Chatwin did not succeed with \"The Nomadic Alternative\", he returned to the topic of restlessness and wandering in subsequent books. Writer Jonathan Chatwin (no relation) stated that Chatwin's works can be grouped into two categories: \"restlessness defined\" and \"restlessness explained.\" Most of his work focuses on describing restlessness, such as in the case of one twin in \"On the Black Hill\" who longs to leave home. Another example is the protagonist of \"Utz\", who feels restless to escape to Vichy each year, but always returns to Prague. Chatwin attempted to explain restlessness in \"The Songlines\", which focused on the Aboriginal Australians' walkabout. For this, he returned to his research from \"The Nomadic Alternative\".\n\nBorders are another Chatwin theme. According to Elizabeth Chatwin, he \"was interested in borders, where things were always changing, not one thing or another.\" Patagonia, the subject of his first published book, is an area that is in both Argentina and Chile. The Viceroy of Ouidah is a Brazilian who trades slaves in Dahomey. \"On the Black Hills\" takes place on the borders of Wales and England. In \"The Songlines\" the characters the protagonist mostly interacts with are people who provide a bridge between the Aboriginal and white Australian worlds. The main character in \"Utz\" travels back and forth across the Iron Curtain.\n\n\"The theme of exile, of people living at the margins... is treated in a literal and metaphorical sense throughout Chatwin's work,\" stated Nicholas Murray. He identified several examples. There were people who were actual exiles, like some of those profiled in \"In Patagonia\", and the Viceroy of Ouidah, unable to return to Brazil. Murray also cited the main characters in \"On the Black Hill\": \"Although not strictly exiles... [they] were exiles from the major events of their time and its dominant values.\" Similarly, Murray wrote, Utz is \"trapped in a society whose values are not his own but which he cannot bring himself to leave.\"\n\nChatwin returned to the subject of art and objects during his career. In his early writing for the \"Sunday Times Magazine\", he wrote about art and artists, and many of these articles were included in \"What Am I Doing Here\". The main focus of \"Utz\" is on the impact the possession of art (in this case porcelain figures) has on a collector. Utz's unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in Czechoslovakia even though he had the opportunity to live in the West. Chatwin constantly struggled with the conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects. His distaste for the art world resulted from his days at Sotheby's; some of his final writing focused on this. The topic appears in the final section of \"What Am I Doing Here\", \"Tales from the Art World,\" which consists of four short stories. At the end of \"What Am I Doing Here\", Chatwin shares an anecdote of advice he received from Noël Coward: \"Never let anything artistic stand in your way.\" Chatwin stated, \"I've always acted on that advice.\"\n\nWith the publication of \"In Patagonia\", Chatwin invigorated the genre of travel writing; according to his biographer, Nicholas Murray, he \"showed that an inventive writer could breathe new life into an old genre.\" The combination of his clear, yet vivid prose and an international perspective at a time when many English writers were more focused on home instead of abroad helped to set him apart. Aside from his writing, Chatwin was also good looking, and his image as a dashing traveller added to his appeal and helped make him a celebrity. In the eyes of younger writers such as Rory Stewart, Chatwin \"made [travel writing] cool.\" In \"The New York Times\", Andrew Harvey wrote, \n\"Nearly every writer of my generation in England has wanted, at some point, to be Bruce Chatwin; wanted, like him, to talk of Fez and Firdausi, Nigeria and Nuristan, with equal authority; wanted to be talked about, as he is, with raucous envy; wanted above all to have written his books.\"\n\nChatwin's books also inspired some readers to visit Patagonia and Australia. As a result, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism, and it became a common sight for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of \"In Patagonia\". \"The Songlines\" also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people on whom Chatwin had based his characters, much to their consternation, as he had failed to disclose such intentions to them.\n\nBeyond travel, Chatwin influenced other writers, such as Claudio Magris, Luis Sepúlveda, Philip Marsden, and William Dalrymple. Nicholas Shakespeare stated that some of Chatwin's impact came from the difficulty of categorising his work, which helped to \"set free other writers...[from] conventional boundaries.\" Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify himself as one, or as a novelist. (\"I don't quite know the meaning of the word novel,\" he said). He preferred to call his writing stories or searches. He was interested in asking big questions about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources. His friend and fellow writer Robyn Davidson said, \"He posed questions we all want answered and perhaps gave the illusion they were answerable.\"\n\nAccording to his biographer Nicholas Shakespeare, Chatwin's work developed a cult-like following in the years immediately after his death. By 1998 a million copies of his books had been sold. However, his reputation diminished following revelations about his personal life and questions about the accuracy of his work.\n\nThe accuracy problem had arisen before his death, and Chatwin had admitted to \"counting up the lies\" in \"In Patagonia\", though he stated there were not many. While researching Chatwin's life, Nicholas Shakespeare stated he found \"few cases of mere invention\" in \"In Patagonia\". Mostly, these tended to be instances of embellishment, such as when Chatwin wrote of a nurse who loved the work of Osip Mandelstam – one of his favorite authors – when in fact she was a fan of Agatha Christie. When Michael Ignatieff asked Chatwin his opinion of what divided fact from fiction, he replied, \"I don't think there is [a division].\"\n\nSome individuals profiled in \"In Patagonia\" were unhappy with Chatwin's portrayals of them. They included a man whom Chatwin insinuated was homosexual and a woman who thought her father was unjustly accused of killing Indians. However, Chatwin's biographer found one farmer who was featured in the book who thought Chatwin's depictions of himself and other members of his community were truthful. He stated, \"No one likes looking at their own passport photograph, but I found it accurate. It's not flattering, but it's the truth.\"\n\nChatwin's bestseller, \"The Songlines\", has been the focus of much criticism. Some describe his viewpoint as \"colonialist\", citing his lack of interviews with Aboriginals and reliance instead on white Australians for information about Aboriginal culture. Other criticism comes from anthropologists and other researchers who spent years studying Aboriginal culture and dismiss Chatwin's work because he visited Australia briefly. Yet others, such as writer Thomas Keneally, believe \"The Songlines\" should be widely read in Australia, where many people had not previously heard of the songlines.\n\nThe questions about the veracity of Chatwin's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death. Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work. Nicholas Shakespeare said, \"His denial [of his AIDS diagnosis] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must have lied about his work. Some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books – or else not to bother with them.\" In 2010 \"The Guardian's\" review of \"Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin\" opened with the question, \"Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?\" However, Rory Stewart has stated, \"His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [than they once were]. And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance.” In 2008 \"The Times\" rated Chatwin No. 46 on their list of \"50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945\".\n\nChatwin's name is used to sell Moleskine notebooks. Chatwin wrote in \"The Songlines\" of little black oilskin-covered notebooks that he bought in Paris and called \"moleskines\". The quotes and anecdotes he had compiled in them serve as a major section of \"The Songlines\", where Chatwin mourned the closure of the last producer of such books. In 1995, Marta Sebregondi read \"The Songlines\" and proposed to her employer, the Italian design and publishing firm Modo & Modo, that they produce moleskine notebooks. In 1997, the company began to sell them and use Chatwin's name to promote them. Modo & Modo was sold in 2006, and the company became known as Moleskine SpA.\n\nIn 2014 the clothing label Burberry produced a collection inspired by Chatwin's books. The following year Burberry released a limited edition of Chatwin's books with specially designed covers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "522827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=522827", "title": "Edgar Dewdney", "text": "Edgar Dewdney\n\nEdgar Dewdney, (November 5, 1835 – August 8, 1916) was a Canadian surveyor, road builder, Indian commissioner and politician born in Devonshire, England. He emigrated to British Columbia in 1859 in order to act as surveyor for the Dewdney Trail that runs through the province. In 1870, Dewdney decided to take up a role in Canadian government. In this year, he was elected to the Legislative Council of British Columbia as a representative form the Kootenay region. In 1872, he was elected as a member of Federal Government for the Yale region representing the Conservative party. He was reelected to this position in 1874 and again in 1878. Dewdney served as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories from 1879 to 1888, and the fifth Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia from 1892 to 1897. Additionally, he served as the Indian commissioner in the North-West Territories from 1879 until 1888. In 1897, Dewdney retired from politics and began working as a financial agent until his death in 1916.\n\nThroughout his political career, Dewdney played a role in the settlement of western Canada and defining the relationship between the government of Canada and the Indigenous peoples of the North-West in the nineteenth century. Dewdney experienced several political and humanitarian issues throughout his political appointments. As Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, Dewdney had to manage with a starvation crisis faced by the Indigenous peoples after years of buffalo decline. Additionally, as Indian Commissioner, Dewdney subsequently tackled issues pertaining to the North-West Rebellion of 1885.\n\nEdgar Dewdney was born in Bideford, England to parents Charles Dewdney and Fanny Hollingshead. He grew up in a wealthy family, providing him with many social opportunities. Dewdney had two marriages throughout his life, neither producing any children. The first marriage was to Jane Shaw Moir in 1864, and the second in 1909 to Blanche Elizabeth Plantagenet Kemeys-Tynte. Dewdney originally wanted to pursue a career in civil engineering, studying the subject at Cardiff University. After his civil engineering training in 1859, he decided to start a life in the Pacific Northwest in hopes of making a fortune with his newly acquired qualifications. In addition, Dewdney was also motivated to move to the North-West Territories after the discovery and further mining of gold in the Fraser Valley. He was active in the development of pack trails in the colony of British Columbia including the Dewdney Trail which became the main trail into the interior of the colony.\n\nDewdney was active in political life in British Columbia throughout the 1860s. Dewdney had a limited understanding of the functions of Canadian politics when his interests first piqued. After a few years in Provincial politics, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald requested Dewdney to become the Indian Commissioner in the North-West, as he knew of the “Indians” in the area quite well. Dewdney had an advantage due to his general knowledge of Indigenous peoples and that he did not originate from Ottawa. Later in his life, Dewdney held dual titles of Indian Commissioner and Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories. He was also the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia and after three years retired and became a surveyor. Due to his prestigious career in politics, Dewdney was considered suitable to conduct the study and surveying of the Cascades. He discovered three routes, Allison, Coquihalla, and Railroad Passes in his 1902 exhibition. However, he disclosed that he never liked any of these routes due to their engineering difficulties. As a result, Dewdney suggested the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) should be built from Midway to Princeton, then north to Merritt and Spences Bridge, and have Fraser Canyon as the way through the Cascades. Dewdney is recognized as a legendary trail builder of colonial days in British Columbia, as this played a large role in the westward expansion of Canada. Despite this recognition, he faced issues regarding Canadian expansionism and the effect on Indigenous peoples.\n\nDewdney was originally employed as a surveyor, and supervised the survey of New Westminster. In 1865, Dewdney was appointed by Governor Frederick Seymour to oversee the construction of a trail to the East Kootenay region of the British Columbia Interior so that coastal merchants might benefit from the burgeoning trade associated with gold mining in that area. This was also done to secure a line of communication within the region to prevent an American takeover of that part of the province. Although used for only a few years, parts of the Dewdney Trail, as it was known, remain to this day and are used for recreational hiking. Provincial Highway 3 largely follows the route of the Dewdney Trail.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1869, Dewdney became active in Colonial politics, representing the electoral district of Kootenay in the Legislative Council of British Columbia. After the Colony joined Canadian Confederation in 1871, he served as a Conservative Member of Parliament for the riding of Yale following his election in 1872. He was appointed a member of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald's cabinet in 1879, where he served as Indian commissioner for the North-West Territories until 1888.\n\nIn 1881, Macdonald arranged Dewdney's appointment as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, then an executive position. Dewdney resigned his seat in the Commons, but remained Indian Commissioner during his term as Lieutenant-Governor, which lasted until 1888. Macdonald, along with being Prime Minister, held the cabinet post Minister of the Interior. Dewdney took orders directly from Macdonald. Responsible government had not been granted to the North-West Territories, so Dewdney was the Territories' head of government. Perhaps his most notable decision in office was changing the territorial capital from Battleford to Wascana — Cree for \"Pile of Bones\" — in 1883: a featureless location without water apart from a short spring run-off Wascana Creek, trees or topography. This is where Dewdney had secured a substantial real estate for himself adjacent to the near-future planned Canadian Pacific Railway line. Other townsites were also considered probable territorial capitals, including Fort Qu'Appelle and Qu'Appelle, the latter to the extent of having been designated the cathedral city of the new Diocese of Qu'Appelle by the Church of England in Canada. The matter was a national scandal at the time. Still, the initial major street of Pile of Bones, later renamed Regina by Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne, was called Dewdney Avenue.\n\nAfter his term as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, Dewdney was again elected to Parliament and served as the member for Assiniboia East (now southeastern Saskatchewan) from 1888 to 1891. During this period he also served as Minister of the Interior and Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn 1892, he was appointed to the non-executive viceregal post of Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia. He served in this post until 1897.\n\nHe retired from politics in 1900, after unsuccessfully running for Parliament in New Westminster, British Columbia.\n\nIn 1909, following the death his wife Jane, Dewdney remarried. His new wife was Blanche Kemeys-Tynte, the daughter of Colonel Charles John Kemeys-Tynte of Halswell, Somerset, England.\n\nUpon taking office in May, 1879, Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories Edgar Dewdney came face to face with the plight of the natives in the wake of the disappearing buffalo. The exploitation of buffalo for the fur trade had greatly affected the Indigenous peoples who relied completely on every aspect of the buffalo for food, clothing and resources for housing. Indigenous peoples had already starved to death at Qu'Appele, Fort Walsh, Fort Macleod, Battleford, Carlton, Fort Pitt, Fort Saskatchewan, Edmonton, Touchwood Hills, Fort Ellice, Moose Mountain, Fort Calgary, and elsewhere. Dewdney's solution was to locate the native tribes on reserves. There agents would teach them how to farm.\n\nHe reported conditions at the Blackfoot Crossing in July 1879 as follows:\n\nBy that autumn, seventeen instructors were established at different reserves along with supplies of tools and seed. They began to teach the natives how to farm.\n\nDewdney was later denounced for not responding to four official requests for food aid during the winter of 1882-83 for \"over 2000 Indians here almost naked and on the verge of starvation\". When finally pressed to send food supplies after the official requests, Dewdney stated it was government policy to use famine to force Indians onto reserves.\n\nThe Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was conducted by Dewdney in 1880 regarding the administration of Indian Affairs in the North-West Territories. This communication was written to the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs in Ottawa and provided insight into conditions in the North-West Territories during the 1880s. This report was controversial because it only provided a colonial viewpoint into the lives of Indigenous peoples. The Indigenous voice was omitted from the report, making the report bias to colonial views. Dewdney outlined in the Royal Commission to Inquire into Changes Affecting the Administration of Justice in the North-West Territories that the “scarcity of buffalo in Fort Walsh had not been exaggerated, and numbers of Indians of the Cree, Assiniboine and Blackfeet were awaiting the arrival of Col. MacLeod and myself.” The decline of the buffalo populations created a famine which “reduced the Indians to a state of dependence on government relief supplies and even forced the Indians to seek government on their reserves.” In order to resolve the starvation crisis, Dewdney proposed relocating all Indigenous peoples in the region onto reserves. Because of the scarcity in buffalo populations, the government had no other choice but to provide Indigenous peoples on reserves with food rations, distributed by the North-West Mounted Police.\n\nDue to the high decline in the buffalo population, many Indigenous communities were facing starvation. Changes needed to be made in regards to the government’s actions in controlling and alleviating the threat of a starvation crisis. Dewdney traveled to parts of the North-West with Col. James Macleod, the Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, in response to the threat of a starvation crisis. Before traveling to Blackfoot Crossing, Macleod stated in Fort Walk that the resolution to the buffalo problem and the starvation of the Indigenous peoples was to promote an agricultural lifestyle rather than one based on the reliance on buffalo. After observing the crisis at Blackfoot Crossing, Dewdney stressed that the Indigenous peoples there should work to relieve themselves of starvation that resulted from the disappearance of buffalo. He proposed stationing instructors on reserves in order to educate the Indigenous peoples on how to sustain an agricultural society, as well as to provide those on reserves with the necessary supplies. The Royal Commission shows that members of the Blackfoot nation were grateful for Dewdney’s efforts made to ending the crisis. Both members of government in Ottawa and Dewdney believed that the Blackfoot Crossing could be a prosperous agricultural settlement. Upon arriving to Blackfoot, Dewdney hoped to talk about this possible prosperity but before his arrival, he had received news that a number of buffalo had crossed through the settlement and destroyed the crops.\n\nIn the early 1880s, government officials such as Dewdney withheld rations from Indigenous people as a tool to bring them into submission. From 1881 to 1883, it was recorded that buffalo and buffalo herds were headed towards Fort Walsh. Upon hearing this, Dewdney ordered that the food rations for Fort Walsh be reduced. The Northwest Mounted Police(NWMP) began preparation to abandon their post at the fort, which meant Indigenous peoples could only receive their treaty payments and other assistance if or when they signed the treaty and moved north. Dewdney's refusal to allow the supply of relief to Indigenous communities created a volatile environment. In October 1882, reports from Augustus Jukes, senior surgeon for the NWMP, regarding the limited food and lack of shelter did not have an effect on Dewdney. As a result, Fort Walsh closed in 1882 which left many Indigenous people starved, unless they signed Treaty One or Treaty Two. Dewdney said that he would recognize any male Cree as a chief if he could get the support of one hundred or more men to accept him as a leader. As a result, many Metis, Cree and Assiniboine separated from their bands in order to receive the promised rations from the government.\n\nIn 1882, it was reported that Cree and Assiniboine that settled in Cyprus Hill were supplied with minimal food rations. As a result, many Cree and Assiniboine began travelling to Indian Head. However, many died along the journey as a result of starvation. The reserve in Indian Head was called Win-cha-pa-ghen, or Skull Mountainettes, because the mountains were covered with the victims of the starvation crisis who received little aid from the government of Canada. In the spring, many made the journey back to Cyprus Hill, where Augustus Juke reported that many of the Cree and Assiniboine were in a state of starvation and did not have the basic necessities of life. This was the direct result of the Indian Commissioner’s insistence on letting them starve unless they complied with the government's request for them to sign treaties. Dewdney was quoted saying “the longer they continue to act against the wishes of the Government, the more wretched will they become.”\n\nIn 1884, tensions between Louis Riel and the government were rising. Charles Borromée, the Justice of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories and legal advisor in the North-West Territories, sent a letter to Edgar Dewdney on September 5, 1884 regarding the conditions of Indigenous communities during the North-West Rebellion. Borromée wrote “Riel can harm the country, and that the government must come to the assistance of the Indians or misery and starvation will result.” Dewdney ultimately ignored this information, allowing the half breed (Metis) to starve.\n\nIn 1886, Dewdney described the state’s initiatives to provide rations to Indigenous communities as a “policy of reward and punishment,” implying that only bands deemed as “loyal” would receive rations, livestock, and other farming equipment. To help promote an agricultural society within Indigenous communities, treaties stipulated that farming supplies would be made available as well as livestock. Dewdney believed that one of the reasons Indigenous people could not become self supporting was due to the treaties failing to provide grist mills for grain farming. Dewdney, as Indian Commissioner, noted that there were insufficient resources and supplies despite the terms of the treaties. The government of Canada promoted self sufficiency in agriculture by Indigenous peoples as a way to offset the cost of famine relief from the government. However, the supplies that would help Indigenous peoples on reserves to create an agricultural based community were lacking. The lack of supplies from the government frustrated many. The starvation crisis would symbolize the defining issue during Edgar Dewdney’s tenure as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories. The Crisis regarding the starvation of the natives is still seen as a major political and humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe North-West Rebellion of 1885 was an uprising led by the Metis and other Indigenous peoples of the North-West Territories against the Canadian government. The Metis felt threatened by the continuous buying and selling of land by the Canadian government. There was the question of whether the Metis would receive the land that they were entitled to, while the government continued to give more land to settlers. This, in conjunction with the decline in buffalo in the region and the lack of government relief, resulted in the North-West rebellion. The North-West Rebellion began as a peaceful protest by the Metis against the lack of government relief. The reinforcement of the North-West Mounted Police to the area was seen as a threat to the Metis, and helped to jumpstart violence between the Metis and the government. The violent altercation lasted for five months, with the eventual defeat of the Metis rebels by federal enforcers.\n\nEdgar Dewdney was the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories during the Riel-led rebellion of 1885. It is clear that there were many issues in the North-West region prior to the outbreak of the Metis rebellion. The North-West Mounted Police Superintendent L.N.F. Crozier acted as an informant for Dewdney in the events leading up to the outbreak of the rebellion. With the information that he had gathered, Dewdney believed that he could maintain peace within the region and that he had control of the situation. However, he did not have faith in the ability of Indian agents across the region to maintain and control the unrest that was beginning to arise within Indigenous communities. As a result, Dewdney called for the appointment of a second roving inspector in 1885, as he believed that it would be difficult for one man to do the job effectively over a vast amount of territory, as well as the fact that the current roving inspector T.P. Wadsworth was reporting his findings to other officials behind Dewdney’s back. Since his arrival in the North-West Territories, Dewdney supported the increase of rations for Indigenous communities and believed that it was crucial that the terms outlined in treaties were met in order to maintain peace between the Metis and colonial settlers.\n\nThe issue regarding Metis land claims and entitlement had been a topic of discussion for many years prior to the outbreak of rebellion. Louis Riel’s return to Canada caught the attention of the Canadian government, which motivated the efforts of communities along the Saskatchewan River to advance political demands. The Federal Government was not willing to negotiate with the Metis on the matter. Metis leader, Louis Riel and the Metis forwarded their demands to Ottawa in 1884. Dewdney, as Lieutenant Governor, stated that the government would investigate the claims of those who did not receive land or script in Manitoba, but made no other promises. Riel wanted “land titles and government by the people” instead of Dewdney holding absolute power in the region. The issue had been brought up to Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald many times, but had always been pushed aside to prioritize other issues occurring within the dominion. Many settlers in the region were becoming anxious and feared the outbreak of a rebellion, so in February 1885, Dewdney urged the Prime Minister to respond to their demands from the Metis. This request was once again ignored. Later that month, officials in Saskatchewan began sending reports to Dewdney regarding Metis military action that had begun in the area. It had been reported that the Metis had obtained weapons and ammunition from colonial traders, which was considered illegal. This was alarming for Dewdney, who believed that action needed to be taken to control the Metis and suppress tensions. As a result, Dewdney prepared to send police to the area if conditions worsened. When Riel and his followers began to take prisoners and recruit support from individuals on nearby reserves, Dewdney allowed one hundred Mounted Police to intervene. Dewdney was devoted to preventing other Indigenous peoples on reserves from joining Riel in the North-West Rebellion as an attempt to keep settlers in the area at ease. Land was prioritized by Riel and the Metis in order to secure their future prosperity and survival in the area. Their demands were not recognized by the government of Canada and prompted some Metis communities to prepare for military action.\n\nLand and food were important tools used by the government of Canada to control Indigenous peoples. Therefore, land and food were key motivators in the resistance. Prior to the outbreak of the rebellion, Dewdney was unwilling to provide large amounts of rations to Metis settlements unless they were in extreme desperation. This mindset changed during the rebellion, as Dewdney’s idea was to “tempt” Metis and other Indigenous peoples to remain on their reserve and remain devoted to the dominion by offering them more rations and goods. When violence broke out between Riel and the government, Dewdney conducted a tour of reserves in the area, listening to the specific needs of the individuals living on the reserves in an attempt to keep them content. Dewdney offered them more rations of tobacco, bacon, flour, and tea. This was done to keep the Indigenous people on the reserve loyal to the state and separated from the rebellious Metis. Dewdney maintained this appeasement strategy throughout the rebellion. He emphasized the need to be loyal to the state throughout the rebellion. Dewdney suggested that rations and other goods should be withheld from “rebel Indians” after the North-West Rebellion had ended, until it was decided how justice could be achieved. Dewdney believed that those who had been loyal to the state should be rewarded after the North-West Rebellion had ended. These individuals were awarded through the distribution of money and livestock.\n\nThe North-West Rebellion can be linked to the starvation crisis, which is represented in the Frog Lake Massacre. The Frog Lake Massacre on April 2, 1885 was due to the restlessness of the Native people in the area of Frog Lake due to the lack of food and resources. Theresa Delaney, a settler who was held captive whose husband was shot in Frog Lake believed that Edgar Dewdney should be blamed as a cause for the massacre in that while visiting Frog Lake, Dewdney made many promises in regards to food and aid, but none of the promises were fulfilled. Although the massacre cannot be directly linked to Dewdney’s unfulfilled promises to the Indigenous peoples of Frog Lake, it is clear that the lack of government intervention at a time of crisis worsened the conditions. Due to the lack of resources, aid, and food provided to those in the region, it is clear that the residents of Frog Lake were living in unjust circumstances. Additionally, Dewdney acted as a mediator between the government and the Indigenous peoples of Frog Lake.\n\nThe North-West Rebellion eventually ended on June 3, 1885 with subsequent consequences and as well as solutions to ensure there would be no repetition of violence. After the North-West Rebellion had ended, Dewdney took actions to improve the level of security on reserves. This was done to prevent another rebellion of the same nature from occurring in the region. Dewdney believed that all of those who were involved in the North-West Rebellion should be sentenced accordingly. He supported heavy jail sentences for the perpetrators and believed that many executions needed to be carried out in order to make a statement, including the execution of Louis Riel. Dewdney believed that the future of Indigenous communities lay in the younger generation. He feared Indigenous children and the power that they held. This was one of the arguments that justified his support the closing of day schools and the creation of Indian residential schools in order to fully transform Indigenous children into model citizens. He believed that children needed to be removed from the influence of their Indigenous parents and communities. This needed to be done in order to maintain control and ensure that another rebellion of similar nature did not occur. The failure of the North-West Rebellion caused the government of Canada to impose other regulations on the lives of individuals, such as Indian residential schools. The intended purpose of Indian residential schools were to isolate Indigenous children from the influences of their family in order to effectively assimilate them into Euro- Canadian society. These schools operated within Canada until 1996. They were opened and funded by the Canadian government and were operated by the Catholic church. At these schools, Indigenous children faced extreme physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as an assimilation tactic. The traumatization that Indigenous children faced at these schools has been passed down through generations and continues to have an extremely negative effect on Indigenous communities in the twenty-first century.\n\nDewdney had the prenominal \"the Honourable\" and the postnominal \"PC\" for life by virtue of being made a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada on September 25, 1888.\n\nSettler expansion westward further strained Indigenous and Crown relations. Metis and Indigenous peoples were affected by the increase in westward expansion and the methods of land settlement imposed by the government in Qu’Appelle and Saskatchewan. The Metis distrusted Dewdney due to his control over the land in question for settlement. New settlers arriving in the region began to push Metis out of Manitoba. The uncertainty regarding the fate of the Metis in Manitoba in regards to settler migration became a reality. Surveying of Metis land for the new settlers created new tensions, which Dewdney failed to acknowledge. There are some instances of Dewdney mediating territorial disputes as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, and while travelling the areas affected by the starvation crisis in 1879. He noted in the Royal Commission that the Sacree nation was in dispute with the Blackfeet over flour rations. The Sacree were forced to travel to Fort MacLeod in order to avoid further trauma caused by starvation, but voiced concern over the area also being inhabited by the Blackfeet. Dewdney ended the dispute and the Sacree agreed to move to Fort MacLeod. Dewdney was involved in mediating the territorial disputes between the Metis and settlers when tensions were heightened.\n\nThe early 1880s saw raids led by Indigenous bands to steal cattle and horses from ranchers. This is directly linked to the loss of buffalo in the area and the subsequent starvation crisis. These raids occurred across into the United States and created American tensions. As a Result, Dewdney created a permit system in 1882 so that groups such as the Blackfeet and Assiniboine could move across the border to hunt, visit relatives, and for leisure. Dewdney supported and defended the allegations against Canadian Indigenous peoples as being held responsible for the depredations in Northern Montana. Rancher anxieties and prompts from Americans due to raids by Indigenous peoples pushed Dewdney to move Indigenous bands “from the southern prairies of Assiniboia to reserves north of the Canadian Pacific Railroad.” This plan disrupted bands searching and following remaining buffalo across the international boundary. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were instructed to use force when faced with bands attempting to move north. Dewdney triumphantly claimed that there were no more natives north of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) line. As a result, the development of the CPR could continue further west by the instruction of Dewdney.\n\nConcerning governance, Dewdney advocated for the enforcement of the Indian Act to dispose Indian chiefs. This would help the colonial government maintain power in local communities by removing Indigenous leadership and eradicating self-governance. As a result of this enforcement, arrests were made against those who were viewed as ‘bad Indians.’ The use of language such as ‘bad Indians’ left for interpretation that any Metis or Indigenous person that rejected government policy was atrocious. Additionally, Dewdney mediated territorial disputes as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs while traveling areas affected by colonial expansion as well as food and land disputes.\n\nDewdney has been criticized for using the courts as an extension of administering his own concept of justice (Gavigan, p. 38). He reportedly withheld rations from the Cree until he realized that it created more violence among them (Gavigan, p. 36).\n\nDewdney was known for making many promises to the Indigenous peoples which raised their moral, but ultimately leaving these promises unfulfilled. At the time of the North-West Rebellion, Dewdney was Indian Commissioner as well as Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories. This gave him a great deal of power and influence in the area and created criticism towards him, as many believe that he was able to abuse this power to ultimately achieve his goals. Dewdney was criticized for not responding to requests for food relief made to the government by Metis, Assiniboine and Cree in the winter of 1882 to 1983. The lack of a response from Dewdney in regard to official requests for food supplies to Indigenous communities can be seen as a tactic used in order to push Indigenous peoples onto reserves.\n\nAdditionally, there was concern that the Department of Indian Affairs, its agents, and Dewdney had secretly been in contact with Montana grocery and mercantile firm I.G. Baker Company. The worry was that the Department had purchased subpar goods to distribute to the Metis who were affected by the starvation crisis. It was claimed by the Hudson's Bay Company That Dewdney and other key officials in the North-West and Ottawa were linked with the company and therefore profiting off of the starvation crisis. Dewdney's relationship with the Baker Co. relates back to before his appointment as Indian Commissioner. Dewdney was known to involve himself in various business ventures and investments in the North-West that resulted in his personal financial gain. Flour supplied to Indigenous communities by the Baker Company was unfit for consumption and caused deaths in several reserves. Additionally, there was the belief that the food had been tampered with which created a formal independent investigation into the Baker Company’s flour supply. It was determined that the flour was indeed substandard, which reflected negatively on Dewdney given his relationship with the Company.\n\nFurthermore, there are also reports that Dewdney and other agents from the Department of Indian Affairs used food as a tool for coercion. Many Indigenous people on reserves were at the mercy of these agents.\n\nIt is important to note that Dewdney never truly liked living in the North-West Territories, as he saw the land as bleak and lifeless. He also disliked the harsh climate of the North-West Territories, as it could become intolerable at times. Dewdney suffered from extreme back pain, preventing him from traveling on horseback and camping between reserves. Dewdney’s wife Jane also expressed a longing to return to life in British Columbia, as it was filled with excitement and adventure. After the North-West Rebellion, Dewdney requested political appointments outside of the North-West. On September 12, 1888, he was named Minister of the Interior as well as superintendent general of Indian Affairs. Dewdney was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia on November 2, 1892 and retired December 1, 1897. After his retirement from politics, Dewdney focused on business ventures. Throughout his life, Dewdney managed his personal finances poorly, resulting in his lack of pension to support him in his later life. Subsequently, he also focused on surveying projects for proposed railways in British Columbia. His wife Jane died in January 1909, which prompted his second marriage to Blanche Elizabeth Plantagenet Kemeys-Tynte in 1909. Money continued to be an issue for Dewdney up until his death. He attempted to receive a senate appointment as well as an appeal to receive a pension to aid him in his old age. He never received a senate appointment or a pension. Edgar Dewdney died on August 8, 1916 in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of eighty.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25708185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25708185", "title": "Elaine of Corbenic", "text": "Elaine of Corbenic\n\nElaine of Corbenic (also known as Amite, Heliaebel, Helaine, Perevida or Helizabel; identified as \"The Grail Maiden\" or \"Grail Bearer\"), is a character in the Arthurian legend. She is the daughter of King Pelles and the mother of Sir Galahad by Sir Lancelot. She first appears in The Prose Lancelot (the Vulgate Cycle), but fully emerges as a character in Sir Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\". Her first significant action is showing the Holy Grail to Sir Lancelot.\n\nElaine's father, King Pelles, knew that Sir Lancelot would have a son with Elaine, and that that child would be Sir Galahad, described as \"the most noblest [sic] knight in the world\". Moreover, King Pelles claims that Galahad will lead a \"foreign country...out of danger\" and \"achieve...the Holy Grail\". The source of King Pelles' knowledge is undisclosed.\n\nShe is described as \"passing fair and young\". The sorceress Morgan le Fay is jealous of Elaine's beauty, and magically traps her in a boiling bath. After Sir Lancelot rescues her, Elaine falls in love with him, only to find he is already in love with Queen Guinevere and would not knowingly sleep with another woman. In order to seduce Lancelot, Elaine goes to the sorceress Dame Brusen for help. Dame Brusen gives Lancelot wine and Elaine a ring of Guinevere's in order to trick Lancelot into thinking Elaine is Guinevere. The next morning, Lancelot is most displeased to discover that the woman he slept with was not Guinevere. He draws his sword and threatens to kill Elaine, but she tells him that she is pregnant with Galahad and he agrees not to kill her, but instead kisses her. Lancelot departs, and Elaine remains in her father's castle and gives birth to Galahad.\n\nThereafter, there is a feast at King Arthur's court, and Elaine goes to it. Lancelot ignores her when he sees her, and she is sad because she loves him. She complains of this to Dame Brusen, and Dame Brusen tells her that she will \"undertake that this night he [Lancelot] shall lie with [her]\". That night, Dame Brusen brings Lancelot to Elaine, pretending that it is Guinevere that summons him. He goes along, and once again sleeps with Elaine. At the same time, however, Guinevere herself actually summons Lancelot, and is enraged to discover that he is not in his bedchamber. She hears him talking in his sleep, and finds him in bed with Elaine. She is furious with him and tells him she never wants to see him again. Lancelot goes mad with grief and, naked, jumps out a window and runs away.\n\nElaine confronts Guinevere as to her treatment of Lancelot. She accuses Guinevere of causing Lancelot’s madness and tells her that she is being unnecessarily cruel. After this, she leaves court. Time passes in the story, and Elaine next appears when she finds Lancelot insane in her garden. She brings him to the Holy Grail, which cures him. When he regains his mental facilities, he decides to live with Elaine, and they live together for several years as man and wife.\n\nElaine of Carbonek (or Corbenic, Corbin, etc.) is often passed over in favor of Elaine of Astolat. Like the more famous Elaine, Elaine of Carbonek is in love with Lancelot. Yet unlike Astolat, Carbonek is successful in both bedding and marrying Lancelot. Despite this, she has been overlooked by most literary analysts. One theory for why she has been so ignored is because of the moral ambiguities of her actions. She does not fit into a neat category of female characters; she is neither good nor evil, but something in between. Roger Sherman Loomis's work \"The Grail: From Celtic Symbol to Christian Myth\" draws a connection between the concept of the feminine \"Grail-bearer\" and the sovereignty goddess of Ireland, Ériu, who grants the chalice to only the worthy.\n\nElaine appears in the 1939 novel \"The Once and Future King\", by T.H. White. Although the basic character does not change, there are several key differences. Time is more definitely specified in this version; for instance, when Elaine finds Lancelot in the garden, Galahad is three years old. Additionally, Elaine and Lancelot live together as husband and wife for ten years and actively raise Galahad while Lancelot bears a pseudonym to hide from the court at Camelot. Another key difference between White and Malory is that in White, Lancelot is cured of his insanity by seeing Elaine, but becomes physically sick and is nursed back to health by Elaine. White also chronicles Elaine's final fate, having her commit suicide when it becomes clear that Lancelot will never truly love her or end his obsession with Guinevere. This creates a parallel with the character of Elaine of Astolat, who is also referenced in the novel.\n\nA more contemporary novel is \"Elaine of Corbenic\" by Tima Z. Newman. Based on Malory's account of the three brief encounters of Launcelot and Elaine in \"Le Morte d’Arthur\", it chronicles Elaine’s journey through abandonment to the finding of inner strength and deepening wisdom.\n\nElaine also appears as a character in \"The Mists of Avalon\" by Marion Zimmer Bradley. In this version, she tricks Lancelot with the help of Morgaine into sleeping with her by making him believe she was Gwenhwyfar. Her father finds out and forces Lancelot to marry her to keep her honor. She and Lancelot, in addition to their son Galahad, have two daughters by the names of Gwenhwyfar and Nimue, who later becomes a priestess of Avalon and is used to trick the Merlin Kevin into coming with her to the isle to receive punishment for perceived crimes against the Goddess and later drowns herself. Unlike the Elaines in earlier stories, she dies of natural causes later in the book.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21745037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21745037", "title": "Haile Selassie Gugsa", "text": "Haile Selassie Gugsa\n\nHaile Selassie Gugsa (1907–1985) was an army commander and a member of the Imperial family of the Ethiopian Empire.\n\nHaile Selassie Gugsa was the son of \"Leul\" \"Ras\" Gugsa Araya Selassie. Gugsa Araya Selassie was the \"Shum\" of eastern Tigray Province as well as the great grandson of Emperor Yohannes IV.\n\nIn April 1932, Gugsa Araya Selassie died and Haile Selassie Gugsa replaced him as \"Shum\" of eastern Tigray with the title of \"Dejazmatch\".\n\nOn 15 June 1932, \"Dejazmatch\" Haile Selassie Gugsa married \"Leult\" Zenebework Haile Selassie, Haile Selassie's second daughter. He was about 25 years old and she was not quite 14 years old. \"Leult\" Zenebework died in 1934 amid allegations of poor treatment at the hands of her husband. Relations between Emperor Haile Selassie and \"Dejazmatch\" Haile Selassie Gugsa became quite cold after this. The strain between them was especially apparent when the Emperor insisted on bringing his daughter's body back to Addis Ababa for burial rather than allowing her husband to bury her in the capital of eastern Tigray, Mek'ele. This was a clear sign of Emperor Haile Selassie's unhappiness with his son-in-law. \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie on his part was very bitter that he was not elevated to the titles of \"Leul\" and \"Ras\" which had been held by his father before him, and were held by his rival Seyum Mengesha of western Tigray.\n\nAt the same time as the marriage of Haile Selassie Gugsa to Zenebework Haile Selassie, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen married \"Leult\" Wolete Israel Seyum, the daughter of \"Ras\" Seyum Mangasha of western Tigray Province. He was 16 years old and she was about 26 years old. The two marriages were meant to cement ties between the reigning Shoa branch of the Imperial Ethiopian dynasty with both rival sides of the Tigrean branch of the dynasty. The death of Princess Zenebework and the chill in relations between Haile Selassie Gugsa and Emperor Haile Selassie signalled the failure of this policy at least with the Eastern Tigrean branch of the dynasty.\n\nOn 3 October 1935, as \"Dejazmatch\", Haile Selassie Gugsa was the commander in the Mek'ele sector when the Italians invaded Ethiopia. As the Italians advanced, Emperor Haile Selassie ordered \"Ras\" Seyum Mangasha, the Commander of the Ethiopian Army of Tigre, to withdraw a day's march away from the Mareb River. Later, the Emperor ordered \"Ras\" Seyum to move back fifty-five miles from the border. \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie Gugsa, who was also in the area, was ordered to move back thirty-five miles. This was to demonstrate to the League of Nations that Italy was clearly the aggressor.\n\nOn 10 October, Haile Selassie Gugsa went over to the advancing Italians and announced his submission to Italian rule. The Italians immediately released photographs of Haile Selassie Gugsa participating in war councils with the Italian commander on the northern front, General de Bono. Furious Tigrean patriots in Mek'ele promptly set fire to \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie Gugsa's home in the town. On 8 November, Mek'ele fell.\n\nSome sources indicate that Haile Selassie Gugsa and his forces played an active part in aiding the Italian invasion. Other sources indicate his men were soon disarmed. Either way, Haile Selassie Gugsa remained loyal to the Italians who, at a minimum, used him for propaganda purposes during the balance of the invasion and during the five years of occupation. He was honoured by the Italians with the title of \"Ras\" which had been denied him by Emperor Haile Selassie, as well as an Italian pension, and recognition as the senior Tigrean prince over his rival Seyoum Mengesha.\n\nIn May 1938, Haile Selassie Gugsa was in Italy to welcome German dictator Adolf Hitler when the Nazi leader paid a state visit to King Victor Emmanuel III. Hitler was visiting at the invitiation of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in Rome. Haile Selassie Gugsa watched as Mussolini's son, Bruno, led a squadron of twenty-eight bombers that sank two 23,000-ton empty freighters in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\nBy 27 September 1939, during the Feast of Maskal in Addis Ababa, \"Ras\" Haile Selassie Gugsa, \"Ras\" Hailu Tekle Haymanot, and \"Ras\" Seyum Mangasha sat with Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta, the Viceroy and Governor General of Italian East Africa (\"Africa Orientale Italiana\", or AOI). All three Ethiopian leaders had submitted to Italian control of what had been their homeland and what was now the AOI colony.\n\nIn 1941, towards the end of the liberation of Italian East Africa by British, Commonwealth, and Ethiopian \"Arbegnoch\" forces, Haile Selassie Gugsa was temporarily placed in power in Tigray by the British. British Brigadier Maurice Stanley Lush, Deputy Chief Political Officer for Ethiopia, placed him back in command of eastern Tigray Province, with the intention of separating Tigray from Ethiopia, joining it to Eritrea and establishing a new \"Greater Tigray/Tigrign\" monarchy under either Haile Selassie Gugsa or Ras Seyum Mangasha. This plan had the support of many British colonial officers, but not of the British High Command nor of the British government, and Ras Seyum proved to be cold towards any plan of dismembering the Ethiopian Empire. The Lush group had hoped that Haile Selassie Gugsa would be more accommodating. However, Haile Selassie Gugsa was soon caught corresponding with the Italians. As a result, the British took him into custody and kept him first in British held Asmara. The government of Emperor Haile Selassie I approached the British administration and listed the crimes and treason of Haile Selassie Gugsa and requested his extradition. The British indicated that they would extradite him only after obtaining a promise that his punishment would not include death. However, the British ultimately removed Haile Selassie Gugsa from Asmara and sent him to the Seychelles for safe keeping.\n\nIn 1946, after continued requests for extradition, Haile Selassie Gugsa was returned to the Ethiopians. In 1947, he stood trial and was declared a fascist collaborator and a traitor. Haile Selassie Gugsa then threw himself on the mercy of the Emperor. As a result, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was placed under house arrest at Gore, and later at Ambo for twenty-eight years. His Italian-supplied honorific title of \"Ras\" was not recognised and he reverted to his old title of \"Dejazmach\".\n\nIn 1947, eastern Tigray was incorporated into western Tigray and was governed by \"Ras\" Seyum Mangasha as hereditary prince of all Tigray. \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie Gugsa and his side of the family of Emperor Yohannes IV fell from grace. They no longer enjoy favour either from the Emperor in Addis Ababa or from \"Ras\" Seyum Mangasha in Tigray.\n\nIn 1974, the Derg toppled the Ethiopian monarchy and \"Dejazmach\" Haile Selassie Gugsa was freed. However, even after he was released, the Derg continued to regard him as a fascist collaborator and as a traitor to his country. Haile Selassie Gugsa remained under effective house arrest at Ambo in western Ethiopia from that point on although technically no longer a state prisoner. Haile Selassie Gugsa died in early 1985.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "216114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216114", "title": "Jerry Rubin", "text": "Jerry Rubin\n\nJerry Clyde Rubin (July 14, 1938 – November 28, 1994) was an American social activist, anti-war leader, and counterculture icon during the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, he became a successful businessman.\n\nRubin was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of a truck driver who later became a Teamsters' union official.\n\nRubin attended Cincinnati's Walnut Hills High School, co-editing the school newspaper, \"The Chatterbox\" and graduating in 1956. While in high school Rubin began to write for \"The Cincinnati Post\", compiling sports scores from high school games. He attended Oberlin College, and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and later went on to graduate from the University of Cincinnati, receiving a degree in history. Rubin attended the University of California, Berkeley in 1964 but dropped out to focus on social activism.\n\nRubin's parents died within ten months of each other, leaving Rubin to take care of his younger brother, Gil, who was 13 at the time. Jerry wanted to teach Gil about the world and planned to take him to India. When relatives threatened to sue to obtain custody of Gil, Jerry decided to take his brother to Israel instead, settling in Tel Aviv. There, Rubin worked in a kibbutz, and studied sociology while his brother, who had learned Hebrew, decided to stay in Israel and moved permanently into a kibbutz. Before returning to social and political activism, Rubin made a visit to Havana, to learn first-hand about the Cuban revolution.\n\nRubin began to demonstrate on behalf of various left-wing causes after dropping out of Berkeley. Rubin also ran for mayor of Berkeley, on a platform opposing the Vietnam War, and supporting black power and the legalization of marijuana, receiving over 20% of the vote. Having been unsuccessful, Rubin turned all his attentions to political protest. His first protest was in Berkeley, protesting against the refusal of a local grocer to hire African Americans. Soon Rubin was leading protests of his own. Rubin organized the Vietnam Day Committee, that led some of the first large numbered protests against the Vietnam War. He took part in planning the world's largest teach-in against the war, organized rallies and demonstrations that attempted to stop a train transporting troops to the Oakland Army Base, as well as trucks carrying napalm. The Vietnam Day Committee was a unique early antiwar organization in that it enjoyed large local participation and is believed to be a forerunner to the national movement against the war in Vietnam.\n\nRubin was one of the founding members of the Youth International Party (YIP) or Yippies, along with social and political activist Abbie Hoffman and satirist Paul Krassner. The Yippies were not a formal organization with a membership list or a direct relationship with constituency, but played upon the media's appetite for anything new and different. They were influenced by Marshall McLuhan's ideas on the importance of electronic communication, and believed that if radical events were made more entertaining the media, especially television would give them greater coverage.\n\nAs Rubin recollected:\n\n... [T]he more visual and surreal the stunts we could cook up, the easier it would be to get on the news, and the more weird and whimsical and provocative the theater, the better it would play.\n\nRubin's appearance before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings is a good example of the Yippies emphasis on conducting political protest as theater, and creating as much attention as possible to their dissent by turning it into a spectacle. Rubin was subpoenaed by HUAC in Washington but instead of pleading the Fifth Amendment as was common, he entered the room dressed in a rented 18th-century American Revolutionary War uniform, proudly claiming to be a descendant of Jefferson and Paine. \"Nothing is more American than revolution,\" he told the committee. Rubin, showing a total lack of concern or worries, lightheartedly blew soap bubbles as members of Congress questioned his Communist affiliations. He subsequently appeared before the HUAC as a bare-chested guerrilla in Viet Cong pajamas, with war paint and carrying a toy M-16 rifle, and later as Santa Claus.\n\nAs Martin A. Lee and Bruce Shlain remark in their book \"Acid Dreams\":\n\nIt was a political ploy designed to make a mockery of the HUAC proceedings; the congressmen were caught off guard, and Rubin's stunt became page-one news throughout the country.\n\nAnother media stunt that gave the Yippies free publicity, not only in United States but all over of the world, was when Rubin, Hoffman and others brought the New York Stock Exchange to halt by tossing money into the air and watched gleefully as the stockbrokers scrambled vehemently for the bills. Yet another successful act in Yippies \"guerrilla theater\" was when during the Presidential elections of 1968 the Youth International Party nominated their own candidate for the presidency.\n\nThe nominee was Pigasus the Immortal, a 145-pound (66-kg) pig that they felt was a realistic alternative to Richard Nixon or his presidential opponents, Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Alabama governor George Wallace. At the official introductions at Pigasus' first press conference, Rubin, while holding the candidate in his arms, demanded he be given Secret Service protection and be brought to the White House for a foreign policy briefing. He also promised, on behalf of Pigasus, a fair election campaign and if Pigasus won the election he would be eaten. This would, maintained Rubin, reverse the usual democratic process in which the pig is elected \"and proceeds to eat the people.\"\n\nIn his book \"DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution\" Rubin says \"media does not \"report\" \"news,\" it creates it. An event \"happens\" when it goes on TV and becomes a myth.\" He goes on to say:\n\nTV time goes to those with the most guts and imagination. I never understood the radical who comes on TV in a suit and tie. Turn off the sound and he could be the mayor! The \"words\" may be radical, but the television is a non-verbal instrument! The way to understand TV is to shut off the sound. No one remembers any words they hear; the mind is a technicolor movie of images, not words. I've never seen \"bad\" coverage of a demonstration. It makes no difference what they \"say\" about us. The picture is the story.\n\nIn October 1967, David Dellinger of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam asked Rubin to help mobilize and direct a March on the Pentagon. The protesters gathered at the Lincoln Memorial as Dellinger and Dr. Benjamin Spock gave speeches to the mass of people.\n\nFrom there, the group marched towards the Pentagon. As the protesters neared the Pentagon, they were met by soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division. who formed a human barricade blocking the Pentagon steps. Not to be dissuaded, Abbie Hoffman, co-founder of the Yippies, vowed to levitate the Pentagon while Allen Ginsberg led Tibetan chants to assist. Eventually, things turned ugly. By the time the group's 48-hour permit expired, approximately 680 protesters had been jailed and 50 hospitalized.\n\nAs one member of the march recalled:\n\nIn spite of the brutality of the police the spirits of the demonstrators were not dampened. Many were exhilarated by what had transpired and some felt it was an event that would mark a turning point. \"It made me see we could build a movement by knocking off American symbols,\" said Rubin. He added:\n\nRubin later played an instrumental role in the anti-war demonstration that accompanied the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago by helping to organize the Yippie \"Festival of Life\" in Lincoln Park. He spoke along with Hoffman at an anti-war rally at the Grant Park bandshell on August 28, 1968 and instructed demonstrators to resist if a riot broke out. However, the extent of violence between Chicago police and demonstrators (which an official government report called a \"police riot\") was not anticipated by the Yippie leaders. Some 1,500 people including civilians and police were injured. The arrest and trial of the Yippie leaders (known later as the Chicago Conspiracy Trial) which began on September 24, 1969 eventually led to the conviction of Rubin and seven others on charges of incitement to riot, including Abbie Hoffman, Rennie Davis, John Froines, David Dellinger, Lee Weiner, Tom Hayden, and Bobby Seale.\n\nThe defendants were commonly referred to as the \"Chicago Eight\". Seale's trial, however, was severed from the others after he demanded the right to serve as his own lawyer and was sentenced to four years in prison for contempt of court, making the Chicago Eight the Chicago Seven. The trial developed into a quiet spectacle, or \"hippie-guerillas theater\" as Rubin described it. Rubin, Hoffman and other defendants intentionally and successfully made a mockery of the court, widely covered by the press, with reporters from the \"New York Times\" and the \"Washington Post\" reporting on it.\n\nRubin, who had declared the trial to be \"the Academy Award of protest\" at one point paraded back and forth in front of Judge Julius Hoffman (no relation to defendant Hoffman), thrusting his arm in a Nazi salute and shouting \"Heil Hitler!\" Another time he and Hoffman wore judge's robes to court. Judge Hoffman ordered both men to remove the robes. They did - but underneath they wore blue Chicago police shirts. \"The day Abbie and I came in wearing judges' robes was a stoned idea,\" Rubin said later. \"It was a turning point in the trial in terms of theatrics, and it just went on from there.\"\n\nIn spite of the danger of being busted, Rubin smoked marijuana before the trial. \"I got stoned a lot for the trial because it was such complete theater – a front-row seat to history – and marijuana intensifies every experience.\"\n\nJudge Hoffman added to the spectacle. Among other things, Hoffman ordered Black Panther leader Bobby Seale chained and gagged during part of the trial.\n\nRubin, along with the six other defendants, was found not guilty on the charge of conspiracy but guilty (with four other defendants) on the charge of incitement. He was also sentenced by the judge to more than three years in prison for contempt of court. All the convictions for incitement were later overturned by an appeals court, who cited judicial and prosecutorial misconduct. Most of the contempt of court citations were also overturned on appeal. The retrial was held in 1972.\n\nThe Vietnam War politicized marijuana, turning it from a sign of an immoral or corrupt person, suffering from amotivational syndrome (psychological condition associated with diminished inspiration to participate in social activities) into deliberate, calculated civil disobedience.\n\nJerry Rubin remarked in 1970:\n\nSmoking pot makes you a criminal and a revolutionary. As soon as you take your first puff, you are an enemy of society.\n\nIn 1972, Rubin was at it again, this time in Miami Beach to organize protests for both the Republican and Democratic Conventions. This time, the local community knew the Yippies were coming and they organized behind a Rubin of their own, Ellis Rubin, a well known attorney. On June 4, 1972, the Rubins debated at the Unitarian Church in Miami, in front of 500 highly charged churchgoers on both sides of the issue, only divided by a church aisle. Jerry began the debate by thanking \"Uncle Ellis\" for the invitation to debate. Ellis, who was not related to Jerry feigned disgust at the association and the event was \"on\". After barbs in both directions, it ended abruptly when Jerry famously dropped an \"F-bomb\" and Ellis took leave to lead the locals out in a protest of their own.\n\nRubin was also interviewed by journalist Dorothy Fuldheim about his book \"Do It\". In the interview, Rubin started to quiz Fuldheim, asking her if she drank. He then referred to the police as \"pigs,\" which offended Fuldheim, who replied, \"I've got a shock for you. Some of my friends are policemen\". Rubin then muttered \"Well, I've got a shock for you. I'm good friends with the Black Panthers.\" At this, Fuldheim threw his book and kicked Rubin off the set saying \"Out! Stop the interview\" as the cameras rolled.\n\nRubin held a post-election party at his place in New York in January 1973, attended by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, after McGovern lost to Nixon. Soon, Rubin retired from politics entirely, and became an entrepreneur and businessman. He was an early investor in Apple Computer, and by the end of the 1970s had become a multimillionaire. Apple didn’t go public until 1980, so how could that investment make him a millionaire.\nIn the 1980s, he embarked on a debating tour with Abbie Hoffman titled \"Yippie versus Yuppie\". Rubin's argument in the debates was that activism was hard work and that the abuse of drugs, sex, and private property had made the counterculture \"a scary society in itself.\" He maintained that \"wealth creation is the real American revolution. What we need is an infusion of capital into the depressed areas of our country.\" A later political cartoon portrayed Rubin as half-guerrilla and half-businessman.\n\nRubin's differences with Hoffman were on principle rather than personal. When Hoffman committed suicide in 1989, Rubin attended his funeral.\n\nIn his memo's \"Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven\" Rubin emphasizes the importance of uniting the personal and the political. He writes:\n\nJerry Rubin appeared posthumously in the 2002 British documentary by Adam Curtis, \"The Century of the Self\". He appears in episode part 3 of 4. This segment of the documentary discusses the Erhard Seminars Training, also known as The \"est\" Training, of which Rubin was a graduate. In his autobiography \"Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven\" Rubin dedicates a chapter on his experience of taking the est Training. He explains why est appealed to him, even though he had initially resisted it:\n\nRubin also appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\"s second episode of its first season. He was announced as \"Jerry Rubin, Leader of the Yippie Movement.\" The sketch is a fake commercial for wallpaper featuring famous protest slogans from the 1960s and 1970s (e.g., \"Make Love, Not War\", \"Off The Pig!\", \"Give Peace A Chance\", \"Hell, No, We Won't Go!\", etc.). He ends the sketch by parodying a famous radical slogan as \"Up against the wall-paper, posters!\" (with the last word bleeped out in a reference to Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers).\n\nIn a motion picture about Abbie Hoffman, \"Steal This Movie\", Rubin was portrayed by Kevin Corrigan. Rubin's love for and promotion of countercultural murderer Charles Manson is chronicled in the film \"Helter Skelter\" (2004). In the 2007 documentary \"Chicago 10: The Convention Was Drama. The Trial Was Comedy\" Rubin is featured both with film footage and with animation using Mark Ruffalo as his voice. In the television show \"Dark Skies\", Rubin is shown organizing an anti-war protest group in Berkeley that has been infiltrated by aliens; he is portrayed by Timothy Omundson.\n\nRubin's anti-establishment beliefs were put down in writing in his book, \"DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution\" (1970), with an introduction by Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver and unconventional design by Quentin Fiore. In 1971, his journal, written while incarcerated in the Cook County Jail, was published under the title \"We are Everywhere.\" The book includes an inside view of the trial of the Chicago Seven, but otherwise focuses on the Weather Underground, the Black Panthers, LSD, women's liberation and his view of a coming revolution.\n\nIn 1976, Rubin wrote another book entitled \"Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven\", which contained a chapter about his experience at an Erhard Seminars Training (EST) session, later included in the book \"American Spiritualities: A Reader\" (2001) edited by Catherine L. Albanese. In \"Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven\" Rubin claims a rational society cannot be built by people who are out of touch with themselves and can't even run their own lives rationally. Real political change will not happen unless people transform their own personal reality, and their own relationships. Much like Arthur Koestler in his collections of essays The Yogi and the Commissar Rubin argues that political work and self-development has to go hand in hand. It was important, he said, that people \"lived\" the society they hoped to create.\n\nAs explained in \"Growing (Up) at Thirty-Seven\" Rubin experimented with many self-improvement techniques in order to overcome his own personal defects, everything from the \"est\" training, hypnotism, meditation and yoga to rolfing, acupuncture, the Arica School, Gestalt therapy and the bioenergetic analysis of Wilhelm Reich's pupil Alexander Lowen. In a review of the book Derek VanPelt comments on Rubin's self quest:\n\nIn 1980, Rubin authored a self-help book with his wife, Mimi Leonard, entitled \"The War Between the Sheets: What's Happening with Men in Bed and What Men and Women Are Doing About It\". It was not well received.\n\nSometime in the mid-1970s Rubin reinvented himself as a businessman. Friend and fellow Yippie Stew Albert claimed Rubin's new ambition was giving capitalists a social consciousness. In 1980 he began a new career on Wall Street as stockbroker with the brokerage firm John Muir & Co. \"I know that I can be more effective today wearing a suit and tie and working on Wall Street than I can be dancing outside the walls of power,\" he said. In the 1980s, he became known for his promotion of business networking, having created Business Networking Salons, Inc., a company that organized parties at the Studio 54 and Palladium nightclubs in Manhattan, where thousands of young professionals and entrepreneurs met and shared ideas. Near the end of his life, Rubin became interested in the science of life extension and was heavily involved in multi-level marketing of health foods and nutritional supplements. His business activities included marketing of a nutritional drink named Wow! that contained bee pollen, ginseng and kelp.\n\nOn November 14, 1994, Rubin jaywalked on Wilshire Boulevard, in front of his penthouse apartment in the Westwood area of Los Angeles, California. It was a Monday evening and weekday traffic was heavy, with three lanes moving in each direction. A car swerved to miss Rubin but a second car, immediately behind the first, was unable to avoid him. He was taken to the UCLA Medical Center, where he died of a heart attack two weeks later. He is interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\nState Senator (D-Santa Monica), fellow Chicago Seven member and friend Tom Hayden said after Rubin's death:\n\nHe was a great life force, full of spunk, courage and wit. I think his willingness to defy authority for constructive purposes will be missed. Up to the end, he was defying authority.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for his capture of Sir William Wallace in 1305 and later joined with King Robert I of Scotland and received large land grants in Knapdale and Kintyre for his service.\n\nJohn was the younger son of Walter Bailloch Stewart, and Mary, Countess of Menteith, the daughter of Muireadhach II Earl of Menteith. John possessed the land of Ruskie in Stirlingshire. John was a party to the Turnberry Bond with his father, Walter Stewart and the Bruces, which was signed at Turnberry Castle on 20 September 1286.\n\nWith his older brother Alexander, John was involved in the resistance against King Edward I of England and were both captured after the Battle of Dunbar on 27 April 1296. While Alexander was released after swearing fealty, John remained a prisoner at Nottingham Castle in England until August 1297, when Edward released John from prison, on his taking oath and giving security to serve with the king in the campaign of 1297 in Flanders.\nHe was appointed the Constable of Lennox and was ravaging the lands of Edward's partisans in Lennox in 1301. John was sent in 1303 to treat of peace with the English, but refrained from pressing his mission. By 1303 John submitted and had been restored to Edward's favour, for on 20 March 1304 John was appointed Warden of the castle, town, and sheriffdom of Dumbarton. Edward was keen to secure the fortification as a major access route into Scotland by sea. John, as sheriff of Dumbarton, captured Sir William Wallace in 1305 and handed him over to the English. For this John was labeled traitorous and was given the contemporary nickname \"Fause Menteith\" (\"Menteith the treacherous, false\").\nWyntoun, whose \"Metrical Chronicle\" was written in 1418, says:\n\nThe English chronicler Piers Langtoft states that Menteith discovered the retreat of Wallace through the treacherous information of Jack Short, Wallace's servant, and that he came under cover of night and seized him in bed. A passage in the Scalachronica, quoted by John Leland, notes, \"William Walleys was taken of the Counte of Menteith, about Glasgow, and sent to King Edward, and after was hanged, drawn, and quartered at London.\"\n\nMenteith was nominated one of the representatives of the Scots barons in the parliament of both nations which assembled at London in September 1305 and was chosen upon the Scottish council, which was appointed to assist John of Brittany, the new Guardian of Scotland, in the English interest. John received on 1 June 1306 from Edward the Earldom of Lennox, while on 15 June he received the Warden of the castle, town, and sheriffdom of Dumbarton office for life. John returned to Scotland in October.\n\nEdward appealed to John in December 1307 to join him in resisting the revolting Robert de Brus, however John abandoned his earldom of Lennox, joining Brus's side. King Robert I of Scotland, rewarded John with large grants in Knapdale and Kintyre. In March 1308, John was among the Scottish magnates who wrote to the King Philip IV of France on behalf of the nation and in 1309, he was sent with Sir Nigel Campbell to treat with Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, receiving a safe-conduct on 21 August, from King Edward II of England. John's English lands were forfeited for his treason. In 1316 he was commissioned with Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray to treat on behalf of Robert Brus for a truce with the English. John remained closely attached to the royal court, as is shown by the numerous charters he attested and was at the Arbroath parliament in April 1320, and signed the Declaration of Arbroath sent by the barons of Scotland to Pope John XXII.\n\nJohn was described as 'guardian' of the earldom of Menteith, as his great-nephew Alan, as Alan was a minor upon Alan I, Earl of Menteith's death. John was one of the negotiators of the thirteen years' truce between Bruce and the English, signed on 30 May 1323 and was present at a Scottish council at Berwick in June. The last recorded grants to him are in 1329, during the minority of King David II of Scotland.\n\nMenteith, by an unknown spouse, had issue:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "335941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=335941", "title": "Koreans", "text": "Koreans\n\nKoreans ( in South Korean; alternatively in North Korean, ; see names of Korea) are an East Asian ethnic group originating from and native to Korea and southern Manchuria.\n\nKoreans mainly live in the two Korean nation states, South Korea and North Korea (collectively referred to simply as Korea), but are also an officially recognized ethnic minority in China, Vietnam, Japan and Philippines, plus a number of former Soviet states, such as Russia and Uzbekistan. Over the course of the 20th century, significant Korean communities have emerged in Australia, Canada, United States and, to a lesser extent, other nations with a primarily immigrant background.\n\nAs of 2017, there were an estimated 7.4 million ethnic Koreans residing outside the Korean Peninsula.\n\nSouth Koreans refer to themselves as \"Hanguk-in\" (), or \"Hanguk-saram\" (), both of which mean \"Korean nation people.\" When referring to members of the Korean diaspora, Koreans often use the term \"Han-in\" (; literally \"Korean people\").\n\nNorth Koreans refer to themselves as \"Joseon-in\" () or \"Joseon-saram\" (), both of which literally mean \"Joseon people\". The term is derived from the Joseon dynasty, a Korean kingdom founded by Yi Seonggye that lasted for approximately five centuries from 1392 to 1910. Using similar words, Koreans in China refer to themselves as Chaoxianzu () in Chinese or Joseonjok, Joseonsaram () in Korean, which are cognates that literally mean \"Joseon ethnic group\". Zainichi Koreans refer to themselves as Zainichi Chousenjin, Chousenjin () in Japanese or Jaeil Joseonin, Joseonsaram, Joseonin () in Korean\n\nIn the chorus of Aegukga, the national anthem of South Korea, the Koreans are referred to as \"Daehan-saram\" ().\n\nEthnic Koreans living in Russia and Central Asia refer to themselves as Koryo-saram (; Cyrillic script: Корё сарам), alluding to Goryeo, a Korean dynasty spanning from 918 to 1392.\n\nKoreans are the descendants or an admixture of the ancient people who settled in the Korean Peninsula, historically said to be Siberian or paleo-Asian. Archaeological evidence suggests that proto-Koreans were migrants from Manchuria during the Bronze Age. It is noteworthy to mention that there were already people living on the Korean peninsula from the Paleolithic age and Neolithic age, and thus it is logical to assume that there was intermingling between these populations.\n\nLinguistic evidence indicates speakers of proto-Korean languages were established in southeastern Manchuria and northern Korean peninsula by the Three Kingdoms of Korea period, and migrated from there to southern Korea during this period.\n\nThe largest concentration of dolmens in the world is found on the Korean Peninsula. In fact, with an estimated 35,000-100,000 dolmen, Korea accounts for nearly 70% of the world's total. Similar dolmens can be found in Manchuria, the Shandong Peninsula and the Kyushu island, yet it is unclear why this culture only flourished so extensively on the Korean Peninsula and its surroundings compared to the bigger remainder of Northeastern Asia.\n\nStephen Pheasant (1986), who taught anatomy, biomechanics and ergonomics at the Royal Free Hospital and the University College, London, said that Far Eastern people have proportionately shorter lower limbs than Europeans and Black Africans. Pheasant said that the proportionately short lower limbs of Far Eastern people is a difference that is most characterized in Japanese people, less characterized in Korean and Chinese people, and the least characterized in Vietnamese and Thai people.\n\nIn a craniometric study, Pietrusewsky (1994) found that the Japanese series, which was a series that spanned from the Yayoi period to modern times, formed a single branch with Korea. Later, Pietrusewsky (1999) found, however, that Korean and Yayoi people were very highly separated in the East Asian cluster, indicating that the connection that Japanese have with Korea would not have derived from Yayoi people.\n\nPark Dae-kyoon et al. (2001) said that distance analysis based on thirty-nine non-metric cranial traits showed that Koreans are closer craniometrically to Kazakhs and Mongols than Koreans are close craniometrically to the populations in China and Japan.\n\nStudies of polymorphisms in the human Y-chromosome have so far produced evidence to suggest that the Korean people have a long history as a distinct, mostly endogamous ethnic group, with successive waves of people moving to the peninsula and three major Y-chromosome haplogroups. The reference population for Koreans used in Geno 2.0 Next Generation is 94% Eastern Asia and 5% Southeast Asia & Oceania.\n\nKorea Foundation Associate Professor of History, Eugene Y. Park said that many Koreans seem to have a genealogical memory blackout before the twentieth century. Park said that the vast majority Koreans do not know their actual genealogical history. Park said that, through \"inventing tradition\" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, families devised a kind of master narrative story that purports to explain a surname-ancestral seat combination's history to the extent where it is next to impossible to look beyond these master narrative stories. Park gave an example of what \"inventing tradition\" was like from his own family's genealogy where a document from 1873 recorded three children in a particular family and a later 1920 document recorded an extra son in that same family. Park said that these master narratives connect the same surname and ancestral seat to a single, common ancestor. Park said that this trend became universal in the nineteenth century, but genealogies which were published in the seventeenth century actually admit that they did not know how the different lines of the same surname or ancestral seat are related at all. Park said that only a small percentage of Koreans had surnames and ancestral seats to begin with, and Park said that the rest of the Korean population had adopted these surname and ancestral seat identities within the last two to three hundred years.\n\nNorth Korea and South Korea share a common heritage, but the political division since 1945 has resulted in some divergence of their modern cultures.\n\nThe language of the Korean people is the Korean language, which uses Hangul as its main writing system with some Hanja. There are more than 78 million speakers of the Korean language worldwide.\n\nEstimating the size, growth rate, sex ratio, and age structure of North Korea's population has been extremely difficult. Until release of official data in 1989, the 1963 edition of the North Korea Central Yearbook was the last official publication to disclose population figures. After 1963 demographers used varying methods to estimate the population. They either totalled the number of delegates elected to the Supreme People's Assembly (each delegate representing 50,000 people before 1962 and 30,000 people afterwards) or relied on official statements that a certain number of persons, or percentage of the population, was engaged in a particular activity. Thus, on the basis of remarks made by President Kim Il-sung in 1977 concerning school attendance, the population that year was calculated at 17.2 million persons. During the 1980s, health statistics, including life expectancy and causes of mortality, were gradually made available to the outside world.\n\nIn 1989 the Central Bureau of Statistics released demographic data to the United Nations Population Fund in order to secure the UNFPA's assistance in holding North Korea's first nationwide census since the establishment of the state in 1948. Although the figures given to the United Nations might have been distorted, it appears that in line with other attempts to open itself to the outside world, the North Korean regime has also opened somewhat in the demographic realm. Although the country lacks trained demographers, accurate data on household registration, migration, and births and deaths are available to North Korean authorities. According to the United States scholar Nicholas Eberstadt and demographer Brian Ko, vital statistics and personal information on residents are kept by agencies on the \"ri\" (\"village\", the local administrative unit) level in rural areas and the \"dong\" (\"district\" or \"block\") level in urban areas.\n\nLarge-scale emigration from Korea began as early as the mid-1860s, mainly into the Russian Far East and Northeast China or what was historically known as Manchuria; these populations would later grow to more than two million Koreans in China and several hundred thousand Koryo-saram (ethnic Koreans in Central Asia and the former USSR). During the Korea under Japanese rule of 1910–1945, Koreans were often recruited and or forced into labour service to work in mainland Japan, Karafuto Prefecture, and Manchukuo; the ones who chose to remain in Japan at the end of the war became known as Zainichi Koreans, while the roughly 40 thousand who were trapped in Karafuto after the Soviet invasion are typically referred to as Sakhalin Koreans.\n\nKorean emigration to America was known to have begun as early as 1903, but the Korean American community did not grow to a significant size until after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965; as of 2017, excluding the undocumented and uncounted, roughly 1.85 million Koreans emigrants and people of Korean descent live in the United States according to the official figure by the US Census.\n\nThe Greater Los Angeles Area and New York metropolitan area in the United States contain the largest populations of ethnic Koreans outside of Korea or China. Significant Korean populations are present in China, Japan, and Canada as well. There are also Korean communities in Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. During the 1990s and 2000s, the number of Koreans in the Philippines and Koreans in Vietnam have also grown significantly. Koreans in the United Kingdom now form Western Europe's largest Korean community, albeit still relatively small; Koreans in Germany used to outnumber those in the UK until the late 1990s. In Australia, Korean Australians comprise a modest minority. Koreans have migrated significantly since the 1960s. Now they form an integral part in society especially in Business, Education and Cultural areas.\n\nThe Korean population in the United States represents a small share of the US economy, but has a disproportionately positive impact. Korean Americans have a savings rate double that of the average American and also graduate from college at a rate double that of the average American, providing a highly skilled and educated addition to the U.S. workforce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2000 data, mean household earnings for Koreans in the U.S. were $59,981, approximately 5.1% higher than the U.S. average of $56,604.\n\nPak Noja said that there were 5747 Japanese-Korean mixed couples in Korea at the end of 1941. Pak Cheil estimated there to be 70,000 to 80,000 \"semi-Koreans\" in Japan in the years immediately after the war.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33562778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33562778", "title": "Krista Branch", "text": "Krista Branch\n\nKrista Branch is an American singer whose 2010 song \"I Am America\" has been called the anthem of the Tea Party movement. Branch produced \"I Am America\" with her husband, who wrote the song, to protest the treatment of the Tea Party by Democrats. After being uploaded to YouTube, the song was aired on Glenn Beck's radio show and it quickly grew in popularity. It was subsequently performed on Fox News and at events across the country. A former \"American Idol\" contestant, Branch was eliminated early in the process.\n\nBranch was born in Mount Pleasant, Texas and later lived in Bixby, Oklahoma. She married Michael Branch in 2000, and together they have three children. Early in the marriage her family faced serious financial difficulties, and later, while they were living in Colorado, faced the near death of their youngest daughter.\n\nThe Branches became supporters of 2012 presidential candidate Herman Cain after performing at several events where he was a keynote speaker, and \"I Am America\" was made the official theme song of the campaign. Another song released by Branch, \"Remember Who We Are\", was made the official campaign anthem of Rick Santorum's presidential campaign.\n\nBranch's music regularly expresses religious and political themes emphasizing American exceptionalism. Her music has been well received among conservative commentators and members of the Tea Party movement for its political message. The use of Branch's music in the campaigns of Cain and Santorum has been seen as an indication of its appeal among outsider candidates. She has released nine singles and an EP, and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.\n\nBranch was born in Mount Pleasant in East Texas, and began singing in her youth at church along with her four siblings. She also lived in Oklahoma for part of her childhood. Branch moved out of Texas with her family at the age of 14, but remained proud of her Texas heritage. In order to focus on her music career, Branch and her family moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 2010.\n\nShe married Michael Branch in 2000, and they have since had three children together. Early in their marriage they had a low income, and Branch's husband took on several odd jobs, in addition to his work as a youth pastor, in order to make a living. He describes living with Branch in a \"shabby place\" in Tulsa, Oklahoma where they struggled to pay $480 a month in rent. Later they bought a house in Tulsa, and rented it out while they were living in Colorado; they got into financial difficulties when the tenants stopped paying the rent, and they accepted the bank's decision to foreclose the mortgage, as that cleared their debt. They appeared on the Christian news magazine program, the 700 Club, talking about an incident in which their baby daughter was revived after drowning in their bathtub, and they attributed their child's survival to the power of prayer, having been inspired after seeing \"The Passion of the Christ\" a few days earlier.\n\nWhile living in Bixby, Oklahoma, Branch auditioned for the seventh season of \"American Idol\" and was chosen by the judges to move on to the preliminary round in Hollywood. Footage of her performance was not included on the show, but she appeared in a montage at the end of the episode. A week later she was eliminated from the competition. Branch told \"The New York Times\" her decision to enter the contest was not due to a desire to \"be somebody\", but because she felt she should take any opportunity with the belief that God would bless her efforts.\n\nTwo years later, the video for Branch's fourth single \"I Am America\" was released on YouTube. Her husband, Michael Branch, wrote the song partly in response to criticism of the Tea Party protests from Democrats, while also drawing on his own difficulties in life. In an interview for Billy Kelly of the Washington Times' Tea Party Report, Branch told how soon after her husband wrote the song he had her quickly learn the lyrics and then recorded her performing the song. She originally felt the song was too confrontational for her, but decided the message was so important that she should record the song. In the music video, footage of Tea Party rallies is interspersed with scenes of Branch singing on a sound stage and kids holding signs containing political messages and scripture. \"I Am America\" was played on the July 7, 2010, broadcast of Glenn Beck's radio show and a week later Fox News host Bill O'Reilly devoted a portion of his \"Pinheads and Patriots\" segment to the song, saying that \"for honoring legitimate protest\" Branch was a patriot. About 21 days after being uploaded the video had nearly 475,000 views. \"I Am America\" soon became a popular song with the Tea Party movement and has been described as the movement's anthem. \"The New York Times\" described Branch as having a \"dynamic presence\" on stage when singing the song.\n\nGlenn Beck played another Krista Branch song titled \"Remember Who We Are\" on his Insider Extreme radio program early in August 2010 and the song was featured in a video from Branch promoting Beck's Restoring Honor rally. The lyrics for \"Remember Who We Are\" contain a mixture of defiant metaphors with a Christian rock style of music. Branch's husband said he wrote the song to \"remind us of who Americans are in the wake of the most trying of times.\" He stated that Americans stand up and come together in the face of adversity, saying he prayed the song would bring people hope. Calling it an \"inspiring patriotic song\", the video for the song was made the \"Video of the Day\" on Glenn Beck's site on September 3, 2010.\n\nHer first EP \"I Am America\" was released on September 3, 2010 by Soundmindpro Publishing, a company established by Branch's husband. The EP included \"Remember Who We Are\" as well as \"I Am America\" and \"Foreign Land\", a song about departed American soldiers. Jeremiah Holdsworth of IndieVision felt the songs were strong, noting their patriotic themes and subtle religious subtext, and said the song \"Foreign Land\" particularly moved him. Branch released a new single on July 22, 2011, called \"Lead Me On\", a cover of the Amy Grant song and released a video for the song a month later. The song was described as pro-Israel with the music video containing imagery related to the history of the Jewish people, including a prominent emphasis on the Holocaust.\n\nIn addition to her performances in the United States, Branch has performed for teens in Guatemala and Slovakia. She performed at the 2011 Sunbelt Ag Expo in conjunction with the American Bible Society, singing patriotic songs to support American soldiers and performing the national anthem for the Expo. Branch attended the Washington Times' 30th anniversary celebration on October 3, 2012, and performed several songs for the event. Branch regularly performs with Oklahoma jazz saxophonist Grady Nichols. She is working on her debut album, which was scheduled to be released in early 2013.\n\nBranch's music has gained prominence as a result of its use during the 2012 Republican presidential primary. When she was performing \"I Am America\" at events across the country, Herman Cain was often the keynote speaker. Branch and her husband came to appreciate his political views and her husband signed on with Cain's campaign. \"I Am America\" was later adopted by the candidate as his campaign's official theme. Cain said when interviewed about the song, \"The first time I heard that song, the message was so right-on I felt goose bumps just listening to it.\" The song was later described by the National Journal as having \"underscored Cain's anti-elitist appeal\" with its lyrics. Campaign ads featuring \"I Am America\" gave the song increased exposure. A campaign ad using \"I Am America\" that included Cain's chief of staff was the subject of numerous parodies also featuring the song. On \"The Colbert Report\", comedian Stephen Colbert satirically claimed Cain got the line \"I Am America\" from Colbert's book, \"I Am America (And So Can You!)\". Several parodies of the ad were then shown on the program using the song.\n\nRick Santorum announced in March 2012 that he has adopted Branch's song \"Remember Who We Are\" as an official theme song for his campaign, having been without a theme song prior to the announcement. Santorum said he chose the song because \"few songs express the beauty and strength of who we are as free Americans better than Krista's.\" The song is seen as representing the emotion of his campaign effort. David Weigel described Branch as the \"muse of the insurgent conservative candidate\" due to her songs being used by Cain and Santorum in their primary campaigns.\n\nBranch has said her patriotism and admiration for America is the unifying principle of her music. She suggests the Tea Party is animated not by rebelliousness, but by patriotism and love of freedom. Her music often incorporates political themes and religious views that have led to her songs resonating with Tea Party supporters and commentators such as Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly.\n\nThe artist has performed at political rallies led by Beck, and at campaign rallies for Herman Cain. Her husband joined Cain's presidential campaign as state director for Tennessee after hearing him speak at events where Branch performed. Branch said Cain was a natural choice for her and her husband because she felt their beliefs aligned with Cain's. Since 2010, she received three payments that totaled $10,000 for live entertainment services provided at political rallies from several political action committees associated with Cain's campaign.\n\n"}

Following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the region came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi's control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928. There were three families in the Ma clique (\"Ma\" being a common Hui rendering of the common Muslim name \"Muhammad\"), each of them respectively controlled 3 areas, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia. The three most prominent members of the clique were Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, and Ma Hongbin, collectively known as the Xibei San Ma (, \"Three Mas of the Northwest\"). Some contemporary accounts, such as Edgar Snow's, described the clique as the \"Four Ma\" (rather than Three), adding Ma Bufang's brother Ma Buqing to the list of the top warlords. Other prominent Mas included Ma Anliang, Ma Qi, Ma Lin, Ma Hu-shan, and Ma Zhongying.\n\nThe Ma Clique warlords were all Generals in the military of the Republic of China, who controlled all of Mainland China until it was overtaken by the communist People's Liberation Army. The clique was begun by Muslim generals who served in the military of the Qing dynasty, most notably in the Kansu Braves army, who fought in the Boxer Rebellion against invading foreign forces. It was continued by two generations of their descendants.\n\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing, the Ma Clique Generals declared their allegiance to the Republic of China. Unlike the Mongols, Hui Muslims refused to secede from the Republic, and Ma Qi quickly used his diplomatic and military powers to make the Tibetan and Mongol nobles recognize the Republic of China government as their overlord, and sent a message to President Yuan Shikai reaffirming that Qinghai was securely in the Republic. He replaced \"Long, Long, Long, Live the reigning Emperor\", with \"Long live the Republic of China\" on inscriptions. Ma Anliang also agreed to join the new Republic of China government.\n\nWhen the Kuomintang seized power in the Northern Expedition, the Ma Clique warlords became members of the Kuomintang party, and their armies were renamed as divisions of the National Revolutionary Army. The Ma Clique Ninghai Army under General Ma Qi was renamed the National Revolutionary Army 26th Division.\n\nMa Zhongying led the KMT 36th Division to fight against the pro-Soviet governor of Xinjiang, Jin Shuren during the Kumul Rebellion, and the Soviets themselves during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. The 36th Division also crushed the First East Turkestan Republic at the Battle of Kashgar (1934).\n\nIn the Sino-Tibetan War, Ma Clique forces led by Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetan Army. Also during the Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai Ma Bufang waged war against Tibetan tribes in Qinghai to bring them under his control.\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ma Clique forces fought against the Japanese, Ma Hongbin led his 81st corps to defeat the Japanese at the Battle of Wuyuan. Ma Bufang sent Ma Biao to attack the Japanese army. 40 years before, Ma Biao had fought in the Boxer Rebellion against the Eight Nation Alliance.\n\nMa Bufang was ordered by the Kuomintang to invade Xinjiang in the 1940s to intimidate and help oust the forces of the pro Soviet Governor Sheng Shicai. The Ma Clique forces also clashed with the forces of the Second East Turkestan Republic during the Ili Rebellion.\n\n\nThe Ma clique traces its origins to the officers of Qing dynasty General Dong Fuxiang. General Ma Anliang was the de facto leader of the Muslims of northwest China.\n\nThe Three (or Five) Ma took control of the region during the Warlord Era, siding first with the Guominjun and then the Kuomintang; they fought against the Red Army during the Long March and the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\nThe Ma Clique controlled vast amounts of land in the northwest, included Xining and Hezhou.\n\nThe Qing dynasty had granted Ma Bufang's family a yellow standard which had his family name \"Ma\" on it. Ma Bufang continued to use this standard in battle.\n\nMa Bufang recruited many Salar officers from Xunhua County into his army like Han Yimu and General Han Youwen.\n\nDuring one campaign against the Communists in the Civil War, in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, Muslim soldiers numbered 31,000.\n\nDuring the final stages of the Chinese Civil War, the Ma fought for the Kuomintang side in defiance until the communists wiped out his cavalry and took Gansu in August 1949, just months before the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Upon the arrival of communist forces, Ma Hongbin had little possibility of winning and went to communists side. He was appointed vice-chairman (later restyled vice-governor) of Gansu province. He later died in Lanzhou in 1960. Ma Hongkui fled with the Kuomintang to Taiwan. He was indicted by Republic of China Control Yuan as a scapegoat. He later migrated to the United States, where he died on January 14, 1970.\n\nMa Bufang with his son Ma Jiyuan fled by an airplane from Qinghai to Chongqing, then Hong Kong. In October 1949, Chiang Kai-shek urged him to return to the Northwest to resist the PLA, but he chose to migrate to Saudi Arabia with more than 200 relatives and subordinates, in the name of hajj. He later worked as first ambassador to Saudi Arabia for Rep. of China.\n\nMa Lin's eldest son Ma Burong defected to the Communists after 1949 and donated 10,000 Yuan to support Chinese troops in the Korean War. One of Ma Chengxiang's Hui officers, Ma Fuchen 馬輔臣, defected to the Communists.\n\nMa Guoliang's son Ma Tingbin became a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference after defecting to the Communists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are the family trees of the Ma Clique. These trees are not exhaustive.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "187916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187916", "title": "Man in the Moon", "text": "Man in the Moon\n\nThe Man in the Moon refers to any of several pareidolic images of a human face, head or body that certain traditions recognize in the disc of the full moon. The images are composed of the dark areas of the lunar \"maria\", or \"seas\" and the lighter highlands of the lunar surface.\n\nThere are various explanations for how the Man in the Moon came to be.\n\nA longstanding European tradition holds that the man was banished to the moon for some crime. Christian lore commonly held that he is the man caught gathering sticks on the Sabbath and sentenced by God to death by stoning in the book of Numbers XV.32-36. Some Germanic cultures thought he was a man caught stealing from a neighbor's hedgerow to repair his own. There is a Roman legend that he is a sheep-thief.\n\nOne medieval Christian tradition claims him to be Cain, the Wanderer, forever doomed to circle the Earth. Dante's \"Inferno\" alludes to this:\n<poem>\nFor now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine\nOn either hemisphere, touching the wave\nBeneath the towers of Seville. Yesternight\nThe moon was round.</poem>\n\nThis is mentioned again in his \"Paradise\":\n<poem>\nBut tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots\nUpon this body, which below on earth\nGive rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?</poem>\n\nThere is also a Talmudic tradition that the image of Jacob is engraved on the moon, although no such mention appears in the Torah.\n\nJohn Lyly says in the prologue to his \"Endymion\" (1591), \"There liveth none under the sunne, that knows what to make of the man in the moone.\"\n\nIn Norse mythology, Máni is the male personification of the moon who crosses the sky in a horse-drawn carriage. He is continually pursued by the Great Wolf Hati who catches him at Ragnarök. \"Máni\" simply means \"Moon\".\n\nIn Chinese mythology, the goddess Chang'e is stranded upon the moon after foolishly consuming a double dose of an immortality potion. In some versions of the myth she is accompanied by Yu Tu, a moon rabbit.\n\nIn Haida mythology, the figure represents a boy gathering sticks. The boy's father had told him the moon's light would brighten the night, allowing the chore to be completed. Not wanting to gather sticks, the boy complained and ridiculed the moon. As punishment for his disrespect, the boy was taken from Earth and trapped on the moon.\n\nThere is a traditional belief that the Man in the Moon enjoyed drinking, especially claret. An old ballad runs (original spelling):\n<poem>\nOur man in the moon drinks clarret,\nWith powder-beef, turnep, and carret.\nIf he doth so, why should not you\nDrink until the sky looks blew?</poem>\n\nIn the English Middle Ages and renaissance, the moon was held to be the god of drunkards, and at least three London taverns were named \"The Man in the Moone\".\nThe man in the moon is named in an early dated English nursery rhyme:\n<poem>\nThe man in the moon came tumbling down\nAnd asked his way to Norwich;\nHe went by the south and burnt his mouth\nWith supping cold pease porridge.</poem>\n\nOne tradition sees a figure of a man carrying a wide burden on his back. He is sometimes seen as accompanied by a small dog. Various cultures recognise other examples of lunar pareidolia, such as the Moon rabbit.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, a common Western perception of the face has it that the figure's eyes are Mare Imbrium and Mare Serenitatis, its nose is Sinus Aestuum, and its open mouth is Mare Nubium and Mare Cognitum. This particular human face can also be seen in tropical regions on both sides of the equator. However, the moon orientation associated with the face is observed less frequently—and eventually not at all—as one moves toward the South Pole.\n\nConventionalized illustrations of the Man in the Moon seen in Western art often show a very simple face in the full moon, or a human profile in the crescent moon, corresponding to no actual markings.\n\n\"The Man in the Moon\" can also refer to a mythological character said to live on or in the moon, but who is not necessarily represented by the markings on the face of the moon. An example is Yue-Laou, from Chinese tradition.\n\nThe Man in the Moone, by Francis Godwin is one of the earliest novels thought of as containing several traits prototypical of science fiction.\n\nThe Man in the Moon is made up of various lunar maria (which ones depend on the pareidolic image seen). These vast, flat spots on the Moon are called \"maria\" or \"seas\" because, for a long time, astronomers believed they were large bodies of water. They are large areas formed by lava that covered up old craters and then cooled, becoming smooth, basalt rock.\n\nThe near side of the Moon, containing these maria that make up the man, is always facing Earth. This is due to a tidal locking or synchronous orbit. Thought to have occurred because of the gravitational forces partially caused by the Moon's oblong shape, its rotation has slowed to the point where it rotates exactly once on each trip around the Earth. This causes the near side of the Moon to always turn its face toward Earth.\n\n"}

She had multiple contacts with drug traffickers and became associated with the Cali Cartel, later moving to Miami in the 1970s. In the 1980s, she began a mass distribution of cocaine and heroin across the United States. Many of her family members were involved in drug trafficking and Valencia owned hair salons and beauty parlors as a front for her drug trafficking organization. She maintained a vast network of cash houses and kept ledger books, recording all members of her organization. She later became a naturalized American citizen.\n\nOn February 7, 1997, DEA agents and Brazilian authorities arrested Valencia at the airport in Rio de Janeiro. She had undergone extensive plastic surgery to alter her appearance and carried 13 passports with false names. After the Brazilian Supreme Court rejected the appeal to block extradition, Valencia was extradited to the United States and imprisoned in New York to await trial at the Manhattan Federal Court. On July 30, 1999, Valencia was convicted on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nOn 2012, Valencia was released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee.

The September 20, 2010 by-election was occasioned by a successful petition by Reuben Ndolo.\n\nAfter the inauguration of the new constitution of Kenya in 2010 and the creation of the county governments, Sonko announced his intention to run for Senator in Nairobi County. He became the First Senator of Nairobi after it was announced that, with 808,705 votes, he beat his closest competitor, Margaret Wanjiru of the Orange Democratic Movement, who had garnered 525,822 votes, in the Nairobi senatorial election of 2013. Unlike his time in parliament, where he gained notoriety for flaunting House Rules, including incidences of inappropriate dressing, the Senator mostly dressed in official attire.\n\nDuring his time in the Senate, he formed the Sonko Rescue Team, an officially registered Non-Governmental Organization that provided government-like services to residents of Nairobi slums. The then governor of Nairobi County, Dr. Evans Kidero opposed the activities of the group, citing conflict of interests with the county government's operations. The Senator acquiesced and donated the vehicles to the county government after several weeks of tense public exchanges.\n\nAs early as January 2016, Mike Sonko had announced his intentions to run for Governor of Nairobi County in the Kenyan general election, 2017.

On December 6, 1906, Keeper Paterson spotted the crippled \"Coloma\" being battered by waves and 80 knot winds near shore.

He is the president of the British Muslim Initiative (BMI) and currently resides in London, to which he fled from the West Bank in 1990, using forged documents to escape Israeli security authorities.\n\nBefore emigrating to the UK, Sawalha was Hamas’s West Bank military chief. In addition, he supervised the allocation and supply of large amounts of money to Hamas operatives, an activity that led to his being named in a 2004 U.S. indictment against Hamas operative Muhammad Salah.\n\nIn addition to his work with Hamas and BMI, Sawalha is a frequent guest on the Islamist Al-Hiwar television station, and is affiliated with numerous Palestinian and Islamic charities. He has had a hand in organizing several of the flotillas and land convoys attempting to reach the Gaza Strip, through which he has transferred financial aid to Hamas. Sawalha helped found the Muslim Association of Britain and is also a trustee of the Finsbury Park Mosque. In addition, he signed the 2009 Istanbul Declaration, which reaffirms jihad as the proper means to achieving goals such as unifying Israel under Palestinian control.\n\nSawalha was born in Tubas, West Bank, in 1961. Sawalha studied religion at Amman University beginning in 1980.\n\nIn 1988, after studying at Amman University, Sawalha returned to the West Bank, where he lived in Al-Bireh until 1990. He taught at a religious school in Al-Ram and later at the Islamic college (Kuliyat al-Da’wah) in Jerusalem and in Beit Hanina.\n\nSawalha was a senior Hamas activist in the West Bank, and helped establish Hamas' West Bank headquarters in 1989-90. He also instructed regional Hamas commanders to set up military networks, establishing links between local operatives who had not yet been detained and operatives in the United States. After the exposure of his Hamas infrastructure in the West Bank, Israeli security forces declared him a wanted operative. Wanted by Israel, in October 1990 he used forged documents to escape to Jordan, and from there moved on to Britain. He continues to carry out anti-Israeli activities from there.\n\nDuring his first years in Britain, Sawalha continued his operations and sought to consolidate his position as a senior external operative for Hamas. He maintained contact with operatives in the United States, Syria and the West Bank.\n\nLater he would see his active role in Hamas diminish, although his pro-Hamas and anti-Israeli activities have continued. He was a founder of the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), and ran it from 1999 to 2007. Later he served as chairman of the British Muslim Initiative. He was described on a Hamas website as head of the International Committee to Lift the Siege on the Gaza Strip. In 2009 he reportedly was named deputy chairman of the Popular Committee in Support of the Palestinian People. He also signed the 2009 Istanbul Declaration.\n\nSawalha has been involved in organizing flotillas and land convoys to the Gaza Strip while in Britain. Additionally, a BBC program alleged that he had directed funds both for Hamas' armed and missionary wings.\n\nSawalha has been engaged in lawfare against Israel, which takes advantage of Britain's universal jurisdiction law to file criminal complaints against Israeli officials.\n\nA Department of Justice press release names Sawalha as a co-conspirator in the 2004 indictment of Muhammad Salah. Among the aliases mentioned in the indictment are “Muhammad Khadhem Sawalha,” “Abu Obeida,” “Abu Ubada,” “Abu Ubaydah,” “Abu Ubeida,” and “Abu Obadah”. It was reported that Saleh met and spoke with Abu Marzook and Sawalha, who had been in charge of Hamas operations within the West Bank, regarding the need for a resurgence in Hamas operations in the West Bank. During the meeting, Sawalha identified specific Hamas members who could be used to revitalize Hamas's activities, including Awadallah and Saleh al-Arouri. Sawalha told Salah on several occasion to provide money to Hamas operatives on the West Bank, and Salah passed along information to Sawalha as well. Around December 1992, a U.S.-based Hamas member gave pictures of co-conspirator Adel Awadallah, who was on the run from Israeli authorities, to Salah so that Salah could have a false passport made for Awadallah. Sawalha reportedly told Salah explicit instructions as to how to dress and behave when distributing funds to local Hamas operatives.\n\nOn January 13, 1993, en route from the U.S. to the Middle East, Salah met in London with Sawalha, who instructed Salah to provide money to various Hamas members. Salah was eventually indicted for his Hamas role, and in January 1995 pleaded guilty to participating in Hamas affairs, admitting that he had represented Sawalha and had been appointed head of military operations in the West Bank at the request of Abu Marzook and Sawalha. Another report mentioned in the indictment noted the provision of $400,000 to one 'Brother Mohammed Kadhim,' an alias for Sawalha.\n\nSawalha spoke out in 2004 against Israel's assassination of Sheikh Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, saying that Shaykh Ahmad Yassin “lived with his people and died in the service of their cause.”\n\nSawalha is one of the founders of the BMI, which describes itself as follows: “Formed by justice, peace and human rights campaigners, the British Muslim Initiative (BMI) is an organisation which seeks to fight racism and Islamophobia, combat the challenges Muslims face around the world, encourage Muslim participation in British public life, and improve relations between the West and the Muslim world.” The BMI supported the Global March to Jerusalem.\nIn 2009, demonstrators protesting the Gaza attacks clashed with police, and nearly all those arrested were Muslims. Sawalha questioned this disproportion, and also questioned the detainees' treatment. He said the BMI “encourages Muslims to express their feelings and ambitions and frustrations only through political and legal processes. But if anything sends the message that Muslims cannot express themselves through political processes, and they will not be dealt with like others, it will give more strength to the fringes within the community who say democracy and the political system doesn't apply to Muslims in this country. This will only increase the frustration and sense of alienation among these people.”\n\nSawalha and the BMI supported the January 2012 developments in Bangladesh, condemning the International Crimes Tribunal.\n\nAfter the 2009 Gaza flotilla, Sawalha said that the next convoy would avoid the type of confrontation that had occurred with Egypt: “the confrontation will be directly with the Zionist enemy itself on the high seas.” Interviewed on Iranian PressTV about the 2011 flotilla, Sawalha said: “Now the Israelis have to understand that their policies and crimes will not make us turn away and go back. We will continue under any circumstances until we break the siege on Gaza.” Sawalha organized the autumn 2010 LifeLine 5 convoy to Gaza, which reportedly delivered $5 million of aid to the Hamas government.\n"}

This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status.\n\nSubsequently the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were \"lawful combatants\"—rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant.\n\nThe record shows this captive had at least two habeas corpus petitions submitted on his behalf.\n\nA writ of habeas corpus.

The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an \"enemy combatant\".\n\nThey were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat—or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.\n\nThere is no record that Al Subii chose to participate in either his Combatant Status Review Tribunal or Administrative Review Board.\n\nAl Subii was repatriated on February 21, 2007, along with six other Saudis.\nThe seven men were detained, without charge, in Hayer Prison, while Saudi justice officials determined whether they had violated any Saudi laws.\n\n"}

Donnelly\n\nPaul Charles Donnelly (March 28, 1923 – March 12, 2014) was an American guided missile pioneer and a senior NASA manager during the Apollo moon landing program at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Responsible for the checkout of all Apollo launch vehicles and spacecraft, he was also involved in every U.S. manned launch from Alan Shepard's Mercury suborbital flight in 1961 through the tenth space shuttle mission (STS-41B) in 1984.\n\nDuring World War II, Donnelly helped develop the U.S. Navy's Bat, the first \"smart bomb\" in the history of warfare, which his Navy squadron dropped on Japanese ships in Borneo's Balikpapan Harbor in 1945.\n\nDonnelly was born March 28, 1923 in Altoona, Pennsylvania, the son of Irish immigrant David Roy Donnelly and Magdalena (née Schreiber) Donnelly, born in Germany. He graduated from Altoona High School in 1940 (and received its Distinguished Alumni Award in 2000). He left to join the Navy in 1942, and completed courses in electronics at Grove City College. He also attended the Navy's electronics and guided missile technical schools.\n\nNicknamed \"Red\" for his hair, Donnelly was stationed at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., working in electronics for classified guided ordnance development, including the Bat, at the Navy's National Hydraulic Laboratory. On April 28, 1945, his VPB-109 Squadron of PB4Y-2 Privateer bombers, known as the Bat Squadron, dropped several SWOD-9 Bats, the first fully automatic (radar) guided bombs used in warfare, on Japanese shipping in Borneo's Balikpapan Harbor. The attack sank three ships and destroyed a large oil tank. Donnelly advanced to the rate of chief petty officer and was awarded nine Navy medals.\n\nAfter the war, Donnelly became a Navy civil service employee. He was assigned to aircraft and ordnance testing at the Naval Air Ordnance Test Station at Chincoteague Island, Virginia and the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Mayland, where he first met Alan Shepard, Pete Conrad, John Young, Jim Lovell and other future astronauts. In 1951, he was awarded an electronic engineer-equivalent degree by the U.S. Civil Service Commission.\n\nDonnelly had worked at the National Hydraulic Laboratory for Hugh L. Dryden, who became NASA deputy administrator in 1958. Dryden recommended Donnelly to Robert R. Gilruth, head of NASA's Space Task Group at Langley, Virginia, who hired him.\n\nGilruth sent Donnelly to Cape Canaveral, Florida in 1959, where he served as a capsule (spacecraft) test conductor for all Project Mercury and Gemini launches. He became chief test conductor for the Manned Spacecraft Center's Florida Operations during the Gemini program, responsible for planning, scheduling and directing all manned spacecraft pre-launch and launch acceptance tests. In 1964, he was named launch operations manager for KSC, with oversight of both spacecraft and launch vehicles; reporting to Rocco Petrone, KSC director of launch operations.\n\nDonnelly was the launch operations manager on January 27, 1967, when fire swept through the \"Apollo 1\" command module, killing the crew; and served as an observer for the Apollo 204 Review Board's Advisory Group later that year.\n\nAs launch operations manager in KSC's Test Operations Office during Apollo, he was responsible for the checkout of all manned space vehicles, including boosters and spacecraft, from \"Apollo 7\" in 1968 through the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975. By 1973, he became associate director, launch operations.\n\nIn 1976, Donnelly was project manager of Third Century America, a science and technology display at KSC commemorating the U.S. Bicentennial. In 1977, he led the NASA team conducting drop tests of the space shuttle \"Enterprise\" at the Dryden Flight Research Center, California.\n\nIn 1978, Donnelly retired from NASA as director, Space Transportation Systems Processing at KSC, and joined United Space Boosters, Inc. as vice president, Field Operations-Florida. The firm was prime contractor for space shuttle solid rocket booster (SRB) assembly, integration, checkout and refurbishment; and for building two SRB recovery ships. He retired from USBI in 1989 at age 65.\n\nDonnelly was a trustee and former four-term president of the Missile, Space and Range Pioneers, and a founder and two-term chairman of the board of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Space Club.\n\nDonnelly died on March 12, 2014 in Melbourne, Florida.\n\nDonnelly married Margaret Mary Boyle in 1944, a nurse who once treated Arthur Godfrey. Their daughters are Penny Martin, Pamela Gene McLeod (Vincent), and Paula Bleakley (McLeod). They had nine grandchildren, Michele Foster, Jackie Nuvy, Christopher Martin, Justin, Nick and Blaise Bleakley; Conor, Kevin and Michael McLeod; and five wonderful great-grandchildren, Austin Nuvy, Amber Nuvy, Cody Nuvy, Caden Martin, Gus Bleakley. He had 12 brothers and sisters.\n\nDonnelly received six NASA medals, including two Distinguished Service Medals (1973, for his role in the Apollo program; and 1981, for STS-1), three Exceptional Achievement Medals (1969, for \"Apollo 8\"; 1969, for \"Apollo 11\"; and 1978, for shuttle Approach and Landing Tests), and an Outstanding Leadership Medal (1976, for Third Century America). \n\n"}

He was, with Colley Cibber and Thomas Doggett, one of the \"triumvirate\" of actor-managers that was denounced by Alexander Pope and caricatured by William Hogarth as leaders of the decline in theatrical standards and degradation of the stage's literary tradition.\n\nThe family was based for many generations in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. His great-uncle, Judge Wilks, had served Charles I of England during the English Civil War, for whom he raised a troop at his own expense. After Oliver Cromwell won the civil war, Wilks' father moved to Dublin, where Robert Wilks was born.\n\nHe was a clerk to Robert Southwell until he joined the Williamite army. As soon as he was discharged from the army, he worked in the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin from 1691—1693. According to Wilks's version of the story, he had first acted when his army company put on an amateur \"Othello\", and he was so successful that he took up acting as a career. In 1693, Christopher Rich, manager of Drury Lane, hired him to work in London. The same year, he married Elizabeth Knapton.\n\nIn 1698, he was back in Dublin to perform in George Etherege plays, and he was so popular that he, according to his story, had to escape to London, and the next year he began his collaboration of George Farquhar. Farquhar and Wilks were close friends, and the two traveled from Dublin to London together. In 1699, Wilks appeared in Farquhar's \"The Constant Couple\" as Harry Wildair. It was a role that became Wilks's signature, and it made him a heartthrob among the young ladies of London. For the rest of his life Harry Wildair would be Wilks's alter ego, and Wilks would appear in the starring roles in Farquhar plays.\n\nAt Drury Lane, Christopher Rich ruled the theater with a Machiavellian hand. In 1702, Rich had to choose between Wilks and George Powell, the director of rehearsals. The power struggle went Wilks's way, and Powell left for Lincoln's Inn Fields while Wilks was promoted to director of rehearsals. This put Wilks in a powerful position within the theater, and when the actor's strike occurred in 1706, Wilks was well placed to win. Rich was accused of taking one third of all the actors' profits, and the leading actors walked out for the Queen's Theatre at the Haymarket (now Her Majesty's Theatre). Rich, and his son, John Rich, responded by staging opera and pantomime.\n\nAt the Haymarket, Wilks was a star. He took the major roles in \"1 Henry IV, Hamlet, Julius Caesar\", and \"The Way of the World\". He also debuted Farquhar's \"The Beaux' Stratagem.\" In 1709, Wilks, with Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Anne Oldfield joined Owen Swiny in managing the Haymarket. The next year, the group won their struggle and was brought back to Drury Lane, and in 1711 they became the actor-managers of Drury Lane. Thomas Doggett, according to Colley Cibber's somewhat unreliable memoir, forbade any woman being part of the group of managers, and Owen Swiny decided to return to the Haymarket, and so the remaining actor managers formed a \"triumvirate.\" These three managers had profitable and difficult positions, and it is likely that from 1711 to 1714 the shares of the triumvirate never made less than the fantastic sum of £1,000 a year.\n\nIn 1713, Barton Booth replaced Doggett as actor-manager, and in 1714 Richard Steele joined them and got the theatre a royal patent. This patent allowed the company to present Charles Johnson's \"The Country Lasses\" without a license in 1715, and from then on the patent itself was an extremely valuable commodity. Upon Steele's death in 1729, the three current members of the triumvirate got a one-third share in the patent.\n\nThe managers were very busy with the details of production, but they were as busy as actors. Wilks acted one hundred and forty performances in the 1721-2 season, for example, and Wilks rarely toured out of London (with the exception of a single trip to Dublin in 1711). Wilks was one of the mainstays of Drury Lane, both as a manager and, even more, as an attractive male lead. Colley Cibber, whose autobiography portrays himself as a voice of reason and calm, paints Wilks as a vain and tempestuous personality, and it is possible to believe Cibber's complaints about others without believing his praise of himself. Alexander Pope satirized Wilks, along with Cibber and Doggett, in \"The Dunciad\", both versions. William Hogarth depicted Wilks as a man busy making a pantomime play of a jail break while using scripts for \"Hamlet\" as toilet paper. The actor managers responded to the increasing move for \"spectacle\" plays (see Augustan drama for context) and quick productions with low costs, and thus the triumvirate, in particular, was frequently satirized for cheapening the stage.\n\nHe died in 1732 in London and was buried in St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden. He had made an exceptional amount of money in his life, but, upon his death, he left his second wife virtually nothing except a share in the Drury Lane patent.\n\n"}

She is a founding member of the girl groups Sugababes and Mutya Keisha Siobhan. Donaghy left the Sugababes in 2001 following arguments with and accusations from Keisha Buchanan. Donaghy released her debut solo album, \"Revolution in Me\", on 23 September 2003, which contained three single releases. Her second studio album, \"Ghosts\", was released on 25 June 2007. Donaghy appeared in a remixed version of the hit stage show \"Rent\" (titled \"Rent Remixed\") for its 2007–2008 run, playing the role of Mimi alongside Denise van Outen.\n\nOn 20 July 2012, Donaghy and her former \"Sugababes\" colleagues, Buena and Buchanan, confirmed their reunion. The original trio will not be able to release music under the name \"Sugababes\" as it is still owned by the management company. They will instead release music under the new name, Mutya Keisha Siobhan.\n\nDonaghy was born in London, England of Irish descent and has two sisters called Beibhinn and Róisín, who works as her make-up artist. She attended The Douay Martyrs School in Ickenham, in the London Borough of Hillingdon. She was discovered by former All Saints manager Ron Tom, who went on to manage Sugababes.\n\nThe group was created when Donaghy and Mutya Buena hooked up with Buena's best friend Keisha Buchanan while working together in a studio. Manager Ron Tom decided they were to be a trio and came up with the name \"the Sugababies\". Within a year they were offered a record contract by London Records and started calling themselves the Sugababes.\n\nTheir debut single, \"Overload\", was a top ten hit in the UK and was nominated for a BRIT Award for \"Best Single\". It was a top five hit in Germany and New Zealand. The group co-wrote most of the tracks on \"One Touch\", with the help of All Saints producer Cameron McVey. \"One Touch\" produced three more top forty singles in the UK: \"New Year\", \"Run for Cover\" and \"Soul Sound\".\n\nAccording to Donaghy, she left the group because she never got along with Keisha Buchanan, whom she described as a bully. Donaghy became depressed (eventually being diagnosed with clinical depression) and could no longer be a part of the Sugababes. In an interview with \"thelondonpaper\", Donaghy said: \"It's difficult to leave a band and then make sort of a solo career. I left for a very good reason and I've never for a second wanted to go back there.\" Despite this, Donaghy maintained contact with Buena, saying she was always pleased to see her.\n\nIn March 2010, it was reported that Donaghy's former colleague, Mutya Buena, was pursuing legal rights to the Sugababes name. Buena was doing it by herself and only listed Donaghy and Buchanan's names on the documentation to register the Sugababes' name with the EU's trademark office OHIM.\n\nDonaghy started writing music with the help of former producer Cameron McVey to help overcome her depression, and began performing under the alias of \"Shanghai Nobody\", an anagram of \"Siobhán Donaghy\". In March 2003, Donaghy released the 7-inch vinyl single \"Nothing but Song\" under this title as she did not want to be known as \"the girl who left the Sugababes\". For the release of her first commercial single in June 2003, \"Overrated\" (co-written with McVey and Paul Simm), Donaghy reverted to her given name. \"Overrated\" peaked at No. 19 in the UK. It was followed by the single \"Twist of Fate\", which was released in September 2003 and charted at No. 52.\n\nDonaghy's debut album \"Revolution in Me\" was released by London Records in September 2003, and entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 117. Working with her on the album were father-son producers and writers Cameron McVey and Marlon Roudette from Mattafix. Each of the twelve tracks on the album were co-written by Donaghy with McVey, Silvio Pacini, Preetesh Hirji, Matt Kent and others.\n\nIn 2005, Donaghy appeared as a backing vocalist on the Mattafix album \"Signs of a Struggle\" and on the Morcheeba album \"The Antidote\".\n\nDonaghy parted with London Records in a mutual decision with the company. She recorded a second album independently which was picked up by Parlophone, part of the EMI group, which also bought the rights to \"Revolution in Me\". The album's title track, \"Ghosts\", was released in February 2007 as a 12-inch promotional two-track single with the song \"Don't Give It Up\". The latter song was given a wider release in April 2007 and peaked at No. 45 in the UK. The second single, \"So You Say\", was released in June 2007 and peaked at No. 76. A remix of \"Don't Give It Up\" by Jerry Bouthier is featured on the Kitsuné release \"BoomBox\", released in November 2007.\n\nThe album, \"Ghosts\", was also released in June 2007 and peaked at No. 92. Donaghy had said of the release that she wanted commercial success only so that she could continue to make music. She told The London Paper: \"I make left field pop music, and it's a difficult genre to be in because it's not straight pop, it's not alternative, and it's quite hard to market. You have to push it and work it.\" The album was recorded in a small studio near Barneville-Carteret, France with producer James Sanger; other producers/songwriters include Jony Rockstar, Carl McIntosh (\"There's a Place\"), Ben Ranyard (\"12 Bar Acid Blues\"), Charles Lucy of Lucy Tuning (\"Sometimes\") and Marius De Vries.\n\nDonaghy appeared as the character of Mimi, a lead role, in the William Baker-directed production of \"RENT\" in London's West End at the Duke of York's Theatre, which opened in October 2007 and ran until February 2008. She said she was \"overwhelmed that she got the part and was looking forward to the challenge\". In August 2007 she flew to New York to watch \"RENT\" on Broadway to get inspiration for her interpretation of her part. This was Donaghy's West End debut. From 2006 to 2011 she worked as a model booker in London.\n\nIn a January 2009 interview with the music site We7, Donaghy indicated that there will be no further solo albums released for the time being. \"At this point in time I have no further plans to undertake another record of my own. Ultimately, the true nature of the business side of the music industry is enough to keep me away. Nonetheless, if I find myself in the future bursting with ideas and experiences I feel the need to share through music, I will be back,\" Donaghy stated.\n\nIn June 2009, Donaghy was featured on the Square1 single \"Styfling\" produced by Silvio Pacini. Later in the year, she said in an interview with fashion site ponystep.com that she feels she had \"had the break\" she wanted from the industry and was currently working on new music but was unsure when it will be finished.\n\nIn October 2011, several news outlets reported that the original line-up of the Sugababes would reform. In January 2012, further circulations that the group would reunite were sparked, after both Buena and Buchanan tweeted that they were in the studio with \"two other females\" and British rapper Professor Green. However, Buena later denied this on Twitter, saying: \"No track [with] keisha or professor G he was around tha studio. im jus workin on my stuff @ tha moment. (sic)\" Despite this, Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sandé confirmed to MTV UK that she had written new songs for Buena, Buchanan and Donaghy, saying: \"Yes, that is true. I’ve written for the original line-up of the Sugababes, which I’m very happy about because I just loved them when they first came out. I loved their sound, it was so cool. It was very different, so I’m happy to kind of be involved in what started the whole Sugababes journey. It sounds amazing.\" In April 2012, it was reported that the line-up had signed a £1 million record real with Polydor Records. In June 2012, Donaghy confirmed on Twitter that new music would be released, saying: \"the soonest it'll be is in 2 weeks. The latest is 10 weeks.\"\n\nIn July 2012, it was officially confirmed that the group had reformed under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhan and were writing songs for a new album under Polydor. The name was officially registered through the European Union on 27 June 2012. The group attended the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony on 27 July 2012 and posted pictures on their official Instagram page, marked Buena, Buchanan and Donaghy's first public appearance together in eleven years. On 6 August the group confirmed they had written two songs with Shaznay Lewis, former member of All Saints. The next day, Siobhan Donaghy tweeted \"With the girls in the studio. I think the album is finished!!!\" before adding \"Whoop!\" In an interview with Popjustice in August 2012, Donaghy stated that she had no interest in releasing any more solo material, saying that she felt her 2007 album Ghosts was her best work and didn't see why she needed to release any more material and that she was completely focused on MKS. An album was confirmed by Donaghy in 2016 to be released in early 2017 however this never materialised for unknown reasons and they group have not made any announcements or stated if they have remained together since.\n\nOn 10 April 2017, Donaghy revealed on her Instagram account that she was pregnant. On 13 August, she and her husband, Chris McCoy welcomed their first child, Ford Charles McCoy.\n\n\nDonaghy married long-term partner Chris McCoy, in a private ceremony, on 17 January 2013 which MKS bandmates Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan attended. On 10 April 2017 Donaghy confirmed on her official Instagram post that she was expecting her first child. On 13 August 2017 she gave birth to a son, Ford Charles McCoy.\n\n"}
{"id": "32064577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32064577", "title": "Tamara Natalie Madden", "text": "Tamara Natalie Madden\n\nTamara Natalie Madden (August 16, 1975 – November 4, 2017) was a Jamaican-born painter and mixed-media artist working and living in the United States. Madden's paintings are allegories whose subjects are the people of the African diaspora.\n\nMadden was born in Kingston, Jamaica. She moved to America from Jamaica permanently when she was an adolescent.\nShe attended the Frankfield Primary School in Manchester, Jamaica, and Rufus King International High School in Milwaukee, WI. She studied at several universities including University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. Madden became ill with a rare disease for women and African-Americans called IgA nephropathy in 1997 and suffered immensely during that time. While living on the dialysis machine, Madden found art again. Art helped her to heal emotionally, so she decided that it was important to pursue it further. She received a kidney transplant from her brother in 2001, and participated in her first art exhibition that same year. Her first solo exhibition was in 2004, and it garnered her an interview with the late James Auer of the \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\".\n\nAfter her solo exhibition in 2004, Madden relocated near Atlanta, Georgia. She met her mentors Charly \"Carlos\" Palmer and WAK (Kevin A Williams) while living in Atlanta. In 2007, Madden debuted a series entitled, \"Kings & Queens\", which focused on heightening the everyday person. Her work continued to focus on recognizing nobility, honor and respect in those often overlooked by society. Her subjects can be perceived as wealthy and powerful, but for the artist the imagery often represents a power that exudes from within.\n\nMadden created images based on her memories of the people of her native Jamaica, placing them in high status fabrics (raw silks, colorful satins, etc.), that mimicked those worn by royalty. Birds were a common theme in many of Madden's paintings, chosen as a personal symbol of her freedom from illness. Madden's influences were varied, and included Gustav Klimt, Milwaukee artist Ras Ammar Nsoroma, African royalty, Egypt, Asia and the clothing worn by native African and Indian women. She chose to paint imagery that represented the people of the African diaspora.\n\n\"Similar to the works of Gustav Klimt, Madden clothes the goddess in a boldly patterned dress with clear ties to the arts and crafts movement and its populist underpinnings of advocating for art made by the people for the people. The unique quilting of the dress distinguishes the wearer while harkening to feelings of home and of natural, honest labor. Additionally, Madden's use of decadent colors and gold gives her subjects a life of indulgence that they never had.\"\n\nSeveral of her pieces are in the collection of different departments at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and also in the permanent collection of Alverno College in Milwaukee and the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit. Her exhibition at Syracuse University in New York yielded a positive review from the Syracuse newspaper, \"The Post Standard\". Madden's paintings have been featured in the \"New York Times\", The Morning News, \"Upscale Magazine\" published by Bronner Bros., the Gleaner Company, \"The Huffington Post\", and On-Verge | Alternative Art Criticism. In 2014, Madden was named as one of 40 black artists to watch by MSNBC's The Grio.\n\nMadden's solo exhibition at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust garnered positive feedback from local art critics and observers. Her exhibition entitled, \"Out of Many, One\" (the Jamaican motto) sought to expand the visual repertoire of viewers and their perceptions of Jamaica and its people. \"Ms. Madden's recasting of the poor and neglected may remind an observer of Kehinde Wiley's regal portraits of inner-city black men, currently on exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. What distinguishes Ms. Madden's work, however, is the specific focus on Jamaica.\" Madden's work was featured at Art Basel Miami with Mocada Museum and International Visions Gallery. In an interview with Okay Africa, Madden, and several other artists talked about the inspirations for their works.\n\nMadden resided and worked in the Atlanta area and was a fine art professor at Spelman College.\n\n"}

His was a family of ten, seven boys and three girls. Thomas was the seventh child, with three brothers following him. His mother died aged 58, some years before Thomas died. Both Irish and English were spoken in their house, with Thomas's father being a great Irish Scholar and learners of Irish used to come to listen to his stories.\n\nHaving entered De La Salle Training College, Waterford, in 1905 he began his teaching career as principal of Corduff National School, Lusk, County Dublin, in 1908. He taught Irish in Corduff school. He was fond of the Irish language and started branches of the Gaelic League in Skerries and other neighbouring villages. According to his sister Nora he would get the children to march over a Union Jack.\n\nHe spent his last years before his death teaching children in Lusk, where he founded the award-winning Lusk Black Raven Pipe Band as well as Round Towers Lusk Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club in 1906.\n\nAshe joined the Irish Volunteers upon its foundation in November 1913. He was a member of the Keating Branch of the Gaelic League. He was a member of the Lusk company of the volunteers and probably founded it. He sat on the governing body of the Gaelic League and collected considerable sums of money during a trip to the USA in 1914 for both the Volunteers and the League.\n\nCommanding the Fingal battalion (5th battalion) of the Irish Volunteers, Ashe took a major part in the 1916 Easter Rising outside the capital city. Ashe was commandant of 5th battalion of the Dublin brigade; a force of 60–70 men engaged British forces around north County Dublin during the rising. Ashe was sent a messenger Mollie Adrian by Pearse with orders to hold the main road from Fairyhouse. She was sent back to report to Connolly, who returned an order to send 40 men to the GPO. Ashe was only able to send 20 due to his shortage of men.\n\nHe was to contact 1st battalion at Cross Guns Bridge, although he found no one there because vice-commandant Piaras Beaslai knew nothing of this plan. The area was dominated by the central feature of Broadstone station, at the end of the line to Athlone, an important British army barracks. But for some reason they decided not to occupy and garrison the station; similarly the Citizens Army had been confusingly required to withdraw from Mallin. The lack of co-operative communication was later discussed in Piaras Beaslai's books, the research for which included taking accounts from Thomas Ashe whilst they were incarcerated. The failure of inexperienced volunteers to properly co-ordinate their deployments was a critical factor at defeat. Ashe himself had only been appointed commandant shortly before Easter. They were armed only with a few rounds, about a dozen service rifles, a dozen Mausers, and a dozen Martini carbines; some had only a shotgun against well-equipped army regulars.\n\nThe battalion won a major victory in Ashbourne, County Meath where they engaged a much larger force capturing a significant quantity of arms and up to 20 Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) vehicles. Eleven RIC members, including County Inspector Alexander Gray, and two volunteers were killed during the five-and-a-half-hour battle. Twenty-four hours after the rising collapsed, Ashe's battalion surrendered on the orders of Patrick Pearse.\n\nWhen he received the order to surrender he had his doubts as he had difficulty believing the rebels in Dublin had not had success as he did. He sent Richard Mulcahy to Dublin to verify its authenticity.\n\nOn 8 May 1916, Ashe and Éamon de Valera were court-martialled and both were sentenced to death. The sentences were commuted to penal servitude for life. Ashe was imprisoned in Frongoch Internment camp and Lewes Prison in England. While in prison he wrote the poem \"Let Me Carry Your Cross for Ireland, Lord\".\nWith the entry of the US into World War I in April 1917, the British government was put under more pressure to solve the 'Irish problem'. De Valera, Ashe and Thomas Hunter led a prisoner hunger strike on 28 May 1917 to add to this pressure. With accounts of prison mistreatment appearing in the Irish press and mounting protests in Ireland, Ashe and the remaining prisoners were freed on 18 June 1917 by Lloyd George as part of a general amnesty.\n\nThomas Ashe was released from jail in June 1917 under the general amnesty which was given to republican prisoners. Upon release, Ashe returned to Ireland and began a series of speaking engagements. In August 1917, Ashe was arrested and charged with sedition for a speech that he made in Ballinalee, County Longford, where Michael Collins had also been speaking. He went on the run but was captured in Dublin and detained at the Curragh but was then transferred to Mountjoy Prison in Dublin.\n\nHe was convicted and sentenced to two years hard labour. Ashe and other prisoners, including other Kerrymen Fionán Lynch and Austin Stack, demanded prisoner of war status. As this protest evolved Ashe again went on hunger strike on 20 September 1917. As this was a breach of prison discipline the authorities retaliated by taking away the prisoners' beds, bedding and boots. After five or six days lying on a cold stone floor the prisoners were subjected to forcible feeding. On 25 September, Fionan Lynch saw Ashe being carried away to receive this treatment and called out to him: 'Stick it Tom boy'. Ashe called back 'I'll stick it, Fin'. That was the last time they spoke to each other. Ashe was carried back, blue in the face and unconscious. He was removed to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital (which faces the prison) where he died within a few hours. \"Tom Ashe's body lay in state in the hospital morgue, dressed in his Volunteer Republican uniform, and 30,000 mourners filed by.\n\nAt the inquest into his death, the jury condemned the staff at the prison for the \"inhuman and dangerous operation performed on the prisoner, and other acts of unfeeling and barbaric conduct\".\n\nThe death of Thomas Ashe and the subsequent funeral procession had a striking effect on the attitude of the Irish people and became a rallying call to the standard of the Irish Republic. Though not on the scale of O'Donovan Rossa's funeral two years previous, the military aspect of the funeral proved that the Irish Volunteers were well on their way to being restored to pre-1916 levels. Thomas Ashe's remains lay in state in Dublin's City Hall before a funeral procession of over 30,000 marched to Glasnevin Cemetery on 30 September 1917. Michael Collins delivered the funeral eulogy in Irish and English, following the firing of a volley by uniformed Irish Volunteers. The English eulogy being \" nothing additional remains to be said. That volley which we have just heard is the only speech which is proper to make above the grave of a dead Fenian\".\n\nHe was related to American actor Gregory Peck.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57967007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57967007", "title": "Tie Xuan", "text": "Tie Xuan\n\nTie Xuan (1366-1402)courtesy name Dingshi 鼎石, born in Dengzhou, Henan in the Yuan dynasty was a Semu Hui person. He served as an official loyal to the deposed Ming dynasty Jianwen Emperor. During the Jingnan Campaign where the Prince of Yan Zhu Di (the later Yongle Emperor) rebelled against his nephew the Jianwen Emperor, Tie Xuan refused to support Zhu Di and he was sentenced to death by tearing off limbs and frying in oil. Later generations honored him for his unyielding loyalty, in various regions of the country there are temples set up in Tie's honor to offer rituals to him. In the Southern Ming period he was honored with the title of Grand Protector 太保 and given the posthumous name Zhongxiang 忠襄 (loyal assister). Later on, under Qianlong’s reign in the Qing dynasty he was given the posthumous name Zhongding 忠定.\n\nIn the reign of the first Ming Emperor Taizu Hongwu he graduated as a student 太學生 where he did well and was appointed to an official position 給事中, after that he was transferred to the post of military governor and oversaw cases and solved them quickly. Ming Taizu was very happy and gave him the courtesy name dingshi 鼎石. In the early years of the Jianwen reign, he was appointed to a high administrative position in Shandong province 山东承宣布政使司. When Li Jinglong and his army were sent north to fight against Zhu Di, Tie Xuan gave him military rations and supplies, and never stopped. In the third year of Jianwen (1400) Li Jinglong lost at Baigou river, he rode his horse alone to escape to Dezhou, the guards at the gate saw him and they despaired at his loss. Tie Xuan and the ones who helped the army of Gao Yi felt sad over this, were crying with both of their eyes, he went from Linyi straight to Jinan, with Sheng Yong, Song Can's army to fight to the death in defense. The Prince of Yan's army went charging to Dezhou, Li Jinglong ran to Tie Xuan. Dezhou was lost, the Yan troops got millions of their war supplies and got stronger, and then they went to fight in Jinan. Li Jinglong lost again and went south. \n\nOn 15th day of the 5th month the Yan army attacked Jinan, and Tie Xuan and Sheng Yong stood to defend the city. Zhu Di’s letter arrived which urged them to surrender but it failed. On 17th day of the 5th month the Yan army diverted a river by digging into the river embankment and released water into the city. Tie Xuan saw that the situation in the turn of events was not encouraging, he decided to send 1,000 men to feign surrender. Zhu Di was overjoyed, and the Yan army officers and soldiers all cheered for this. Tie Xuan ordered his warriors to lie in ambush on top of the city walls, to wait for Zhu Di to enter, they were to throw down iron panels to attack him, together with an additional ambush at the broken bridge. Soon after, Zhu Di did not yet enter the city, the iron panels were unexpectedly thrown down, Zhu Di was greatly alarmed and fled. The hidden troops for the ambush were exposed, the bridge between was also not yet cut off, Zhu Di urged his horse to run quickly and go. Zhu Di was absolutely furious, he decided to employ cannon to besiege and bombard the city. Tue Xuan wrote on some wooden tablets \"The sublime Emperor's spirit tablet\" 高皇帝神牌 several times and hanged down on the top of the city walls, the Yan army was obliged to cease bombardment. After more than three months of the city under siege, Jinan was still strongly defending its position. At that time the pacification troops there numbered 200,000 and they planned to recover the city of Dezhou. The Prince of Yan was fearful so he lifted the siege to return north. 。\nZhu Di himself launched his troops again, the offensive was set and determined, after less than two days, he abandoned it and went. He believed only through taking Jinan could he cut off north south passage, on the spot he delimited the boundary and guard, it was not difficult for the Yingtianfu (the Nanjing-based government of the Jianwen Emperor) to take it, consequently he took advantage of Li Jinglong's dash, with all his strength used to attack, he hoped he must attack and seize Jinan, but because of Tie Xuan he failed and was frustrated. The Jianwen Emperor heard this and was very pleased, he dispatched an official to go and show appreciation, to bestow gold, to confer upon him the title the third 三世. Tie Xuan entered the palace to pay respect and thank, the Jianwen emperor again bestowed upon him a banquet and reception. All of Tie Xuan's suggestions were all imposed and adopted. Tie Xuan was promoted to the Shandong left minister position in its government. In the 12th month of that year he was promoted to an official in the Ministry of War. 。 The Jianwen Emperor replaced Sheng Yong with Li Jinglong as Yan General, and he assigned Tie Xuan to participate in military affairs. In that winter, Sheng Yong inflicted a defeat on Zhu Di in Dongchang, and beheaded his general Zhang Yu. Zhu Di fled back to Beiping (now Beijing). Since after then, the Yan troops all went via Xuzhou, Pei county to go south, they would not dare again go via route of Shandong. 。\n\nAs the Yan troops day by day advanced, the Jianwen Emperor ordered the Liaodong military official Yang Wen to command 100,000 troops to go ahead and link up with Tie Xuan, to break off the Yan troop's escape route. Yang Wen's army arrived at Zhigu (in Tianjin), and was defeated by the Yan General Song Gui, not one of them arrived in Jinan. In the fourth month of the fourth year of Jianwen (1402) the Yan army at the south of the Xiaohe river the central army fought, Tie Xuan and the various generals beheaded many. Both sides linked up to fight at Lingbi, the pacification soldiers were dispersed and captured. After this Sheng Yong was also defeated. The Yan troops crossed the river, Tie Xuan's soldiers stationed at Huaishang, and army were also defeated. 。\n\nSoon after Tie Xuan's soldiers were defeated he was captured, he refused to surrender, and he sat down with his back turned in court to insult Zhu Di. Zhu Di ordered him to turn his body around, Tie Xuan however all along refused to listen, even after his ears and nose were cut off he refused to look back. Zhu Di commanded to cook his flesh and then to stuff it into his mouth, and also asked, \"is it not sweet\"? Tie Xuan replied sternly, \"the flesh of a faithful official and filial son, why would it not be sweet\"? Thereupon his limbs were torn off, Tie Xuan died after incessant torture. After he died they again used oil to cook his corpse, during the course of events wished to face north to worship, but the heat caused oil to unexpectedly splash and drop. Tie Xuan's wife Mrs. Yang and their two daughters were put into the Royal Academy (China), and forced to become prostitutes. His son Tie Fu'an was exiled to Hechi. His 83-year-old father Tie Zhongming and his mother Mrs. Xue were exiled to Hainan. Mrs. Yang died of illness, the two daughters refused to agree to be disgraced, after Zhu Di also gave them a pardon, they were married off to scholars. His second son Tie Fushu fled to Manchuria beyond the wall. \n\nAlthough the Ming Chengzu Emperor Zhu Di hated Tie Xuan, he still praised his loyalty. At the beginning of Ming Shenzong (Wanli Emperor)'s rule an imperial edict was ordered \"offer sacrifices to the Jianwen emperor's court at all the official's native villages,\" Tie Xuan was decorated as the 7th ranking loyal official to Jianwen in his temple. In the time of the Southern Ming's Hongguang Emperor Zhu Yousong, the title Grand Protector 太保 was posthumously conferred upon Tie Xuan, and the posthumous name Zhongxiang 忠襄. Qing Gaozong conferred the posthumous name Zhongding 忠定. In various locations in Shandong, there are many Tie Gong 鐵公 temples, all offer sacrifices to Tie Xuan. Jinan's Da Ming lakeside has a \"Tie Gong temple”, the Jinan people regard his spirit as their local city god because he was a native of their city.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "20820938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20820938", "title": "William Bolts", "text": "William Bolts\n\nWilliam Bolts (1738–1808) was a Amsterdam-born merchant active in India. He began his career as an employee of the British East India Company, and subsequently became an independent merchant. He is best known today for his 1772 book, \"Considerations on India Affairs\", which detailed the exploitation and despoliation of Bengal by the East India Company which began shortly after the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The observations and experiences he recorded offer a unique resource for scholars inquiring into the nature of early British rule in Bengal. Throughout his life, Bolts continued to propose and execute various trading ventures on his own behalf and in conjunction with various commercial and governmental partners. The ventures of individual traders like Bolts did much to spur governments and large corporations into the expansion of their own interests and empires.\n\nWilliam Bolts was born in Amsterdam on 7 February 1738. The baptismal register of the English church at Amsterdam records his baptism on 21 February 1738. His parents were William and Sarah Bolts, who almost left no traces; perhaps both English, like the witnesses although Piot suggested his father was from the Palatinate (region).\n\nWhen he was fifteen he left for England. Around 1755 he lived in Lisbon where he spent some time working in the diamond trade, according to a deposition he made in 1801, before he went out to Bengal in 1759 where he was employed in Calcutta as a factor in the service of the English East India Company. He learned to speak Bengali, in addition to his other languages, English, Dutch, German, Portuguese and French. Later he was appointed to the Company's Benares (Varanasi) factory, where he opened a woolens mart, developed saltpeter manufacturing, established opium works, imported cotton, and promoted the trade in diamonds from the Panna and Chudderpoor (Chhatarpur) mines in Bundelkhand.\n\nHe fell foul of the East India Company in 1768, possibly because diamonds were a favorite means for Company employees to secretly remit to Britain the ill-gotten gains of private trade in India which they were officially forbidden to engage in. He announced in September of that year that he intended to start up a newspaper in Calcutta (which would have been India's first modern newspaper), saying that he had \"in manuscript many things to communicate which most intimately concerned every individual\", but he was directed to quit Bengal and proceed to Madras and from thence to take his passage to England. Company officials declared him bankrupt, \"to the irretrievable loss of his Fortune\", he later claimed. He never seems to have been able to redeem himself in the eyes of the Company, and in London and elsewhere fought a rearguard action against his many opponents within it.\n\nThe rearguard action occurred in 1772 with the publication of his book \"Considerations on India Affairs,\" in which he attacked the whole system of the English government in Bengal, and particularly complained of the arbitrary power exercised by the authorities and of his own deportation. Today, this type of exposure would be labeled whistle-blowing. As an employee of the East India Company, he had seen how Bengal, once a prosperous region, had been despoiled and bled white by the East India Company. \"Considerations\" was translated into French and enjoyed wide circulation, which contributed to his fame on the Continent. The observations and experiences he records still offer a unique resource for scholars inquiring into the nature of early British rule in Bengal.\n\nIn 1775, Bolts offered his services to the Imperial government, putting forward a proposal for re-establishing Austrian trade with India from the Adriatic port of Trieste. His proposal was accepted by the government of Empress Maria Theresa, and on 24 September 1776, Bolts sailed from Leghorn (today's Livorno) in the dominions of Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, the younger son of the Empress, to India in command of a ship under the Imperial flag, the former Indiaman \"Earl of Lincoln,\" renamed the \"Giuseppe e Teresa\" (also called \"Joseph et Thérèse\" or \"Joseph und Theresia\"). He took with him a ten-year charter authorizing him to trade under Imperial colors between Austria's Adriatic ports and Persia, India, China and Africa, and from Africa and Madagascar to America. This enterprise required substantial capital, which Bolts sought in the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium), and he brought in the Antwerp banker, Charles Proli, and his associates, the bankers I.C.I. Borrikens and D. Nagel.\n\nIn the next few years Bolts established factories on the Malabar Coast, on the South East African coast at Delagoa Bay and at the Nicobar Islands. His aim in establishing a factory at Delagoa Bay was to use it as a base for trade between East Africa and the West coast ports of India. He procured three ships to conduct this \"country\" trade, as trade by Europeans between India and other non-European destinations was called. During his voyage out he obtained Brazilian cochineal beetles at Rio de Janeiro and transported them to Delagoa Bay, thereby predating the introduction to Bengal of this insect for the making of scarlet dyes and carmine. The Imperial flag did not fly for long over Delagoa Bay, as alarmed Portuguese authorities who claimed the place as their own sent a 40-gun frigate and 500 men from Goa to remove Bolts's men in April 1781, and to found the Presidio of Lourenço Marques (Maputo)that established a permanent Portuguese presence there.\n\nWhen it learned of Bolts's venture, the English East India Company instructed its officers in Bengal, Madras and Bombay to \"pursue the most effectual means that can be fully justified to counteract and defeat\" him. Bolts took full advantage of Austria's neutral status in the war between Britain and France, Spain and the Dutch Republic during 1778 to 1783 that formed part of the struggle for American independence. The Company's repeated acts of hostility against Bolts in India were the subject of urgent representations by the Austrian Ambassador in London, resulting in the sending in January 1782 of instructions from the Court of Directors to India, which ordered their officers in India not to give offence to \"any subject of his Imperial Majesty\".\nAlthough when he first arrived in India, at Surat, he was confronted with a wall of opposition erected by the East India Company, he soon made himself known to Hyder Ali, Nawab of Mysore and the strongest opponent of the English in India. He visited the Nawab at his capital, Seringapatam, where he was granted permission to establish trading factories in the Nawab's Malabar Coast dominions at Mangalore, Karwar and Baliapatam.\n\nWhile Bolts himself was at Seringapatam, he sent the \"Joseph und Theresia\" to the Nicobar Islands, where she arrived in June 1778. There her captain, Bennet, took possession on 12 July. The islands were the focus of a Christian missionary effort of the Moravian Brethren, who visited from time to time from the Danish base on the Indian mainland at Tranquebar. In consequence of Bolts' action, the Imperial company had established a trading factory on the island of Nancowery, headed by Gottfried Stahl who was accompanied by five other Europeans. Danish authorities strongly protested against Bolts' action in taking possession of the Nicobars, and in 1783 sent a warship to remove the Austrians.\n\nIn spite of his many achievements since 1776, Bolts's venture, on the whole, had made a loss, to the dismay of his Belgian financial backers, Charles Proli and his associates. Proli also disagreed with Bolts over the importance of the China market: Proli wanted to concentrate exclusively on that market while Bolts urged the equal importance of India as Austrian commodities, such as mercury, lead, copper, iron, tin, and vitriol, could find sale there, in contrast to China where only Spanish silver dollars were accepted in return for Chinese products such as tea, porcelain, and silk. While Bolts was still in India, the Proli group sent out two ships, the \"Ville de Vienne\" to Mauritius and the \"Prince Kaunitz\" to China, without informing him. In ignorance of Bolts' purchase of a ship he called the \"Prince Kaunitz,\" the Proli group sent another ship of the same name to China independently of him. This constituted a breach of their contract with him. They refused to honor the bills he drew upon their bank while he was in India. They petitioned the Imperial Government to have his charter transferred exclusively to them. They also seized the \"Joseph et Therese\" as security when the vessel returned to Leghorn. At an audience with Emperor Joseph II in Brussels on 28 July 1781, Bolt and Proli agreed to the transformation of their association into a share company, and in August Bolts surrendered his charters to the new Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp for the Commerce of Asia (Société Impériale pour le Commerce Asiatique de Trieste et d'Anvers). The Company was to send six ships to China and India, two to East Africa and Mauritius, and three for the southern whale fishery.\n\nThe Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp was opened to public subscription in August 1781 to raise, nominally, half its capital in one thousand shares. In fact, the Company was seriously under-capitalized, as the other thousand shares held by the Proli group and Bolts were paid for by the nominal value of the assets of the former association. Bolts' valuation of those assets was accepted at face value, but it was a fictitious valuation and in fact the new Company inherited the old association's debts. It consequently suffered chronic lack of cash and had to resort to short-term loans and bottomry bonds (for which the ships themselves were the collateral) at a premium of 30 to 35 per cent. Under these conditions, every voyage had to be a success for the Company to remain viable. Also under the terms of the agreement erecting the new company, Bolts ceded his charter to his Belgian partners in return for a loan of 200,000 florins (that is, his 200 shares in the Company) and the right to send two ships on his own account to China.\nThe Imperial Asiatic Company under the direction of the Proli group focussed on the China tea trade. In 1781, 1782 and 1783 the price of tea in Europe, especially in England, had risen to unheard of levels. In 1781 and 1782 no Dutch or French ships appeared at Canton as a result of the American War, and in 1782 only eleven English, three Danish and two Swedish ships called there. Only four out of thirteen English ships returned safely in 1783 due to French naval activity. Attempting to seize the opportunity to make good profits, the Proli group sent five ships to Canton: the \"Croate,\" the \"Kollowrath,\" the \"Zinzendorff,\" the \"Archiduc Maximilien,\" and the \"Autrichien.\" However, the opportunity had been missed as, with the signing of an armistice in January 1783 the former belligerents were able to send their ships to Canton safely, and the summer of 1783 saw a total of thirty-eight ships there, including the five Imperial vessels. They had to buy tea at a high price, but when they returned to Ostend in July 1784 they had to sell at a low price on a glutted market, as well as having to pay for permission to return to that port. The price of tea at Ostend collapsed when the British Government introduced the \"Commutation Act\" in 1784, which reduced the tax on tea from fifty to ten per cent and made smuggling from the Netherlands unprofitable. The price of tea in Europe fell suddenly from 30 to 33 French sols to 11 to 14 sols, or around sixty per cent. Disastrously, a sixth ship, the Belgioioso, carrying a large amount of silver specie for the purchase of Chinese goods, foundered in a storm in the Irish Sea soon after departing Liverpool, where she was fitted out, on the voyage to Canton. Regardless of mounting losses, debts and liabilities, the Company invested in a further ship, the \"Kaiserliche Adler\" or \"Aigle Impériale\" [\"Imperial Eagle\"], a giant of 1,100 tons, specially built for the Company by the Fiume shipyards, which was launched in March 1784, bringing the Company's fleet to a total of nine vessels. Matters came to a head in January 1785 when the Company suspended all payments, and shortly afterward it was declared bankrupt, bringing the Proli banking house down with it. Charles Proli committed suicide. An article in the Dublin press of 25 May 1786 recorded the sale of the dissolved company's ships, \"Zinderdorf\" [sic], \"Kollowrath, Kaunitz, Maximilian\" and \"Austrian,\" \"together with their whole apparel, guns, stores, &c.\" and observed: \"The destruction of this company, as well as several others in Europe, is in a great measure owing to the commutation tea tax in England, and the advantages which territorial possessions throw in favour of the British company.\"\n\nAfter Bolts returned from India in May 1781, he developed the idea for a voyage to the North West Coast of America to engage in the trade in sea otter furs to China and Japan. He apparently heard from John Reid, his agent at Canton (Guangzhou), of the success the crew of James Cook's ships had had there in November 1779 in selling the sea otter pelts they had obtained for trinkets on the American coast in the course of Cook's third expedition to the Pacific. Bolts' ship, the \"Kaunitz\" (not to be confused with the Proli group's vessel of the same name), arrived back at Leghorn (Livorno) from Canton with this news on 8 July 1781. Bolts afterward wrote that he had the ambition of wishing to be the first to profit from this new branch of trade. At an audience in Vienna in May 1782, Bolts discussed his plan with Emperor Joseph II, for which he had bought a ship in England in November 1781. The ship was called the \"Cobenzell\" (or \"Cobenzl\") in honor of the Vice-Chancellor of State, Count Philipp Cobenzl (Kobenzl), a patron of the Imperial Company. Bolts' plan called for the ship to round Cape Horn, take on furs at Nootka, sell or trade them in China and Japan, and return by the Cape of Good Hope. He engaged four sailors who had served under Cook, including George Dixon, who subsequently commanded the \"Queen Charlotte\" on a voyage to the North West coast for the Etches Company of London, and Heinrich Zimmermann, who had written an account in German of Cook's final voyage. He bought a sloop, the \"Trieste,\" as a tender, and obtained letters of credence from the Emperor to various rulers at whose ports the ship would touch.\n\nThe Emperor lent a ready ear to Bolts as the venture offered a vehicle for carrying into effect his desire, prompted by the voyages of James Cook, for an Austrian round the world voyage dedicated to scientific research. This had been urged by the eminent savant Ignaz von Born who, at the Emperor's invitation, nominated five naturalists to go with Bolts on the \"Cobenzell\". The intended expedition was reported in the English press in mid-October 1782, in the following terms:\n\nThe Emperor intends to signalise himself, in imitation of other Princes, by sending a ship round the world to make discoveries. The vessel destined for this tedious and dangerous expedition, is the Count de Cobenzet [sic], which cleared out of the Port of London the 15th of April last; sailed from Leghorn the 26th of August, and arrived at Trieste the 1st of September with a great cargo, part of which she is to take out with her, particularly fourteen chests of watches and watch-work, which she brought from London. Four persons of great learning are to be sent out in her, at the Emperor's expence, to make discoveries in Natural Philosophy. \n\nAlthough the Emperor was initially enthusiastic, he refused to provide finance for it apart from the expenses of his naturalists, and the venture eventually proved impossible to realize. Bolts' hopes for a commercial voyage and the desire of the Emperor and his naturalists for a voyage of scientific discovery were incompatible as a combined undertaking. The opposition of Bolts' Belgian former financial partners and now rivals in the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste and Antwerp was also a cause of it's not going ahead, and in the autumn of 1782, it was abandoned. Instead of sending out a scientific expedition on an Austrian ship as Born had proposed, the Austrian naturalists under the leadership of Franz Jozef Maerter went from Le Havre in April 1783 on the American frigate \"General Washington\" (Captain Joshua Barney) to Philadelphia and thence to South Carolina, Florida, the Bahamas and Santo Domingo (Hispaniola). Besides plants, they were to collect animal and mineral specimens. Reflecting the origins of the enterprise, their instructions gave them the option (which was not taken up) to take ship from Acapulco in Mexico to the Philippines, thence to the Sunda Islands in the Dutch East Indies, the coasts of Bengal, Coromandel and Malabar, and the Iles de France and Bourbon (Mauritius and Reunion).\n\nBolts refused to give up on his hopes for a voyage to the North West coast of America. Emperor Joseph II released Bolts from his obligations (except to his creditors) and gave him leave in November 1782 to take his proposal to the court of Catherine II of Russia. The Russian Court proved unresponsive, so Bolts also put his proposal before the court of Joseph's brother-in-law, Ferdinand IV, King of Naples He had an encouraging response from Naples, where King Ferdinand's Minister of Commerce and the Navy, General Sir John Acton, wanted to promote the kingdom's maritime trade. King Ferdinand gave Bolts a charter, modelled on that he had received from Empress Maria Theresa in 1776, with a term of twenty-one years from 1786, for a Royal Indian Company of Naples (Regia Società del India di Napoli), but the Neapolitan government agreed to support Bolts only after he had made a successful initial voyage at his own expense and risk. Preparations were begun in Marseilles to fit out the Ferdinand, a ship Bolts planned to send to the North West Coast under the Neapolitan flag, but the venture was abandoned when Bolts received a more positive response from the French government.\n\nWith the Emperor's permission, Bolts also put his proposal to Joseph's other brother-in-law, Louis XVI of France. Bolts outlined his plan in letters he wrote to the Maréchal de Castries on 25 January and 9 April 1785. The \"Cobenzell\" would be sent around Cape Horn to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), Nootka Sound, the Kurile Islands, and China. The sloop would be left at Nootka to trade for furs, while a couple of Frenchmen would be left in the Kuriles to learn Japanese and adopt the dress and ways of the inhabitants. At least two ships would be employed to maintain communication with Europe via both the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn. A botanist, metallurgist, and astronomer would be employed. In the South Atlantic, Tristan da Cunha was to be claimed for France and settled as a base for the whaling industry. In addition to Tristan, \"the Island discovered by La Roche in 1675\" (probably South Georgia) was to be found and settled. The French government adopted the concept, though not its author, leading to the sending out of an expedition under the command of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse. Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, Directeur des Ports et Arsenaux, stated in the draft of the memorandum on the expedition he submitted to the King: \"the utility which may result from a voyage of discovery ... has made me receptive to the views put to me by Mr. Bolts relative to this enterprise\". However, as Fleurieu explained to the King: \"I am not proposing at all, however, the plan for this voyage as it was conceived by Mr. Bolts\". Political and strategic considerations took priority over the commercial. Bolts was paid 1,200 Louis for \"the communications useful for the Service which he has given\", but was given no part in the preparation or execution of the Lapérouse expedition.\n\nAt odds with his suspicious Antwerp backers, Bolts found himself declared bankrupt in mid-1782. Although he possessed no capital himself, he was able to trade on his reputation as an expert in the Eastern trade to launch a new share company in 1783, the Triestine Society, which in September sent the \"Cobenzell\" on a commercial voyage to the Malabar Coast by way of Marseilles, where she took in the principal part of her cargo, and the Cape of Good Hope. At Bombay, a second ship was purchased, called the \"Count de Belgiojoso.\" The captain of the Cobenzell, John Joseph Bauer, transferred to the \"Belgiojoso\", and sailed on to China. It was reported from Trieste on 22 February 1786 that \"The Comte Cobenzel East Indiaman arrived in this port the 18th inst. with a rich cargo\" of saltpeter, tea, cassia, camphire, coffee, pepper and other merchandise, having left Canton 23 January 1785. The \"Belgioioso\" under Bauer went from Canton to New York, where she arrived in June 1786. The ship's arrival from New York at Dover, England, was reported in \"The Daily Universal Register\" of 15 September, and the same newspaper published an extract of a letter from Ostend dated 24 September that said: \"The Count de Belgioioso, on account of the East India Company, is arrived here from Bengal and China, her cargo consists chiefly of piece goods, with only a few chests of the finest teas, and one of spices, from Ceylon, at which island they touched on their way home\".\nHaving missed the opportunity provided by the American War of Independence to send a ship to the North West Coast undisturbed by British, American or French competitors, Bolts was apparently able to share in the only voyage sent there under the Imperial flag, that of the \"Imperial Eagle,\" the former English East Indiaman \"Loudoun,\" which in November 1786 sailed from Ostend under Charles William Barkley. Having cleared Ostend in November 1786, the \"Imperial Eagle\" touched at Hawaii in May 1787 and reached Nootka in June, from whence she traded southward for two months along the American coast. Barkley added significantly to knowledge of the geography of the area during this voyage, notably identifying the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He returned to Macao with his takings of furs on 5 November. The expedition was apparently profitable, as an article in \"The London Chronicle\" of 21 June 1788 reported that, \"After taking in his cargo, &c. &c. Captain Berkeley [Barkley] proceeded to Macao, where he disposed of his furs at an amazing price\". It was originally intended that the \"Imperial Eagle\" would make three voyages to the North West Coast, Japan, and Kamchatka, but when she reached Canton after her first season she was sold under threat of retaliation from the East India Company for breaching its monopoly.\n\nIn November 1786, Bolts was given a contract by King Gustav III of Sweden to discover an island off the coast of Western Australia, where a Swedish colony and trading post could be established. However, the plan was shelved after Sweden became embroiled in war with Russia the following year. Bolts was given 250 pounds for his trouble, and the proposed colony was never established.\n\nBolts is said to have attempted to revive his fortunes in France, setting up an enterprise near Paris, but the outbreak of war with Austria and Britain once again destroyed his hopes. He returned to England in 1800-01, where he attempted unsuccessfully to interest the East India Company in obtaining supplies of copper from Anatolia to sell in India. He then moved to Lisbon where in the 1760s, before joining the English East India Company, he had worked in the diamond trade. He made his last will in Lisbon in August 1805 and died, it is said, in a Paris poorhouse (hôpital) in 1808.\n\n"}
