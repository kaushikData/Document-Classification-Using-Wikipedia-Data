Although she travelled widely in the 1960s and early 1970s, appearing at folk clubs and venues in England and Ireland, she never aspired to commercial success or to achieve widespread public acknowledgment of her music. However, she was an influential figure in the English folk music revival, being a source of songs and musical inspiration for others such as A. L. Lloyd, Bert Jansch, Jimmy Page, The Watersons, June Tabor, Sandy Denny, Richard Thompson and Maddy Prior.\n\nBriggs was born in Toton, Beeston, Nottinghamshire, on 29 September 1944. Her mother died of tuberculosis when she was young. Her father, Albert, was severely injured in World War II and she was raised in Toton by her Aunt Hilda and Uncle Bill, who also brought up Hilda's youngest sister, Beryl, and their own daughter Betty. In 1959 she hitch-hiked with a friend to Edinburgh. They stayed overnight with Archie Fisher, who was at that time prominent in the revival of folk music in Scotland, and through him she met Bert Jansch, who had just begun to compose his own songs. Jansch and Briggs had an instant rapport and were an influence on each other for several years.\n\nIn 1962, the Trades Union Congress passed Resolution 42, a resolution to develop cultural activities outside London. To implement this resolution, playwright Arnold Wesker was appointed as the leader, with Ewan MacColl and A. L. \"Bert\" Lloyd heavily involved, and Charles Parker on production. Calling themselves Centre 42, they organised a tour around the Britain, hoping to involve local talent at each stop.\n\nAt Nottingham, MacColl heard Briggs singing \"Let No Man Steal Your Thyme\" and \"She Moves Through the Fair\" and promptly invited her to perform on stage that night. She became a full member of the tour and recorded the same two songs on an album recorded live in Edinburgh later that year. Briggs decided to leave home, just four weeks short of her eighteenth birthday. Centre 42 gave her an administrative job in their offices, liaising with theatres and galleries. She soon acquired the contacts she needed to pursue her own musical career.\n\nBriggs visited the main British folk clubs which were then becoming well known: The Troubadour (London), The Scots Hoose and various Irish music venues. At this time, the emphasis at such venues was on instrumental folk music, and singing was regarded as merely a pause between tunes. A young Christy Moore heard her and was inspired to give more emphasis, in his own music, to singing rather than playing jigs.\n\nBriggs and Jansch lived together in a squat in Earl's Court before moving together to a house in Somali Road, London, where John Renbourn lived, and The Young Tradition also lived for a time. Jansch and Briggs had some resemblance to each other and were often mistaken for brother and sister. It was Briggs who taught Jansch the traditional song \"Blackwaterside\" which he recorded on his \"Jack Orion\" album in 1966.\n\nBriggs began her recording career by contributing two songs to a thematic album, \"The Iron Muse\", released by Topic Records in 1963. MacColl and Bert Lloyd sang on the tracks, and Ray Fisher made a brief appearance singing along with Briggs. An EP \"The Hazards of Love\" was recorded in 1963. It was an early inspiration for both June Tabor and Maddy Prior.\n\nAt about this time, Briggs entered a relationship with a Scotsman known as \"Gary the archer,\" who proved to be violently abusive. She was rescued from this relationship by Hamish Henderson, who accidentally bumped into her and invited her to join Louis Killen, Dave Swarbrick and Frankie Armstrong for a recording project. This resulted in the album called \"The Bird in The Bush\".\n\nWhile touring England, The Dubliners met Briggs and thought she would be the perfect musical partner for Johnny Moynihan, a folk singer they knew in Dublin. In 1965 they accompanied her to Ireland and for the next four years she spent her summers there, travelling by horse-drawn cart and singing in pub sessions. During the winter months she earned money by touring English folk clubs. Her time in Ireland introduced her to the solo Sean-nós singing heard in the songs of Irish folk artists, and this was an influence on her later singing style, when blended with the elements of traditional English music which she had already taken up.\n\nBriggs was notoriously wild at this time. There are many stories from this period about her, such as pushing Moynihan and Andy Irvine out of a hay loft and, on another occasion, jumping into the sea at Malin Head, Donegal to chase seals. In an episode of Folk Britannia (a documentary history of UK folk music aired in 2006) Richard Thompson recalled that he only ever encountered Briggs twice and on both occasions she was drunk and unconscious.\n\nHer attendance at bookings was so erratic that it was said she turned up only five times between mid-1963 and early 1965.\n\nIn 1966, Moynihan and Irvine formed Sweeney's Men and Briggs joined them on tours and learned to play the bouzouki, at that time a rare instrument in Britain or Ireland. She wrote \"Living by the Water\", which was to appear on her 1971 album, accompanying herself on the instrument. \n\nThe folk-rock impresario Jo Lustig signed up Pentangle in 1968 and a couple of years later took on Briggs. Briggs performed along with the folk-rock group COB (Clive's Original Band) at the Royal Festival Hall in 1971.\n\nIn the same year, she recorded an album, \"Anne Briggs\", which was released by Topic. It consisted mostly of Briggs singing traditional unaccompanied songs, but Moynihan plays bouzouki on one track. Later that same year, a second album, \"The Time Has Come\", was released on CBS where she performed her own songs, accompanied by acoustic guitar. The album includes Moynihan's song, \"Standing on the Shore,\" previously recorded by Sweeney's Men. The BBC broadcast a film of the Watersons in 1966, \"Travelling for a Living,\" in which Briggs made a brief appearance. Lal Waterson joined Briggs as a vocalist on the album. Sales of \"The Time has Come\" were poor and it was dropped from CBS's catalogue. The album was re-issued in 1996.\n\nEarly in 1973 she recorded a third solo album \"Sing a Song for You\" with instrumental support from Ragged Robin, a folk-rock band led by Steve Ashley. She was pregnant at the time with her second child. She would eventually move to northern Scotland with her family. It was to be her final studio recording. By the time it was issued, Briggs was living in the Hebrides. Fledgling Records re-issued it in 1996.\n\nWhen Bert Lloyd died in 1990, Briggs was persuaded to sing in a memorial concert. Despite coaxing from some of the brightest names in British folk music, she refused to return to the studio. There was a TV documentary about Jansch in 1993. Briggs took part in this and sang \"Go Your Way My Love\" as a duet with Jansch for the show. The recording later reappeared in the soundtrack \"Acoustic Routes\" (1993) on Demon Records. \n\nIn recent years her material has been re-released on vinyl for Record Store Day. \n\nJansch described her as \"one of the most underrated singers.\" He recorded Briggs' songs (including \"Go Your Way, My Love\" and \"Wishing Well\") on four of his albums. She was also his source for several of the traditional songs which he recorded, including \"Blackwaterside.\" Jansch's instrumental accompaniment to this song was later copied and adapted by Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, who recorded it as \"Black Mountain Side.\"\n\nJansch and John Renbourn play \"The Time Has Come\" on their duo record before eventually recording it with the rest of Pentangle on the \"Sweet Child\" release. One song, \"Mosaic Patterns,\" which she herself has never recorded, was recorded by blues singer, Dorris Henderson. Sandy Denny wrote a song in tribute to Briggs, called \"The Pond and the Stream\" on \"Fotheringay\" (1970).\n\nThe melody line from Briggs' version of 'Willie O Winsbury' was used by Fairport Convention as the basis for the song \"Farewell, Farewell\", from the 1969 album Liege and Lief.\n\nBriggs has been cited as a favourite of Eliza Carthy, Kate Rusby and lead singer of Altan, Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh. Charlotte Greig and the Scottish band James Yorkston and the Athletes have said Briggs was an influence on them. David Tibet of Current 93 also recently mentioned her in an interview. \n\nThe 2009 The Decemberists album, \"The Hazards of Love\", was inspired by Briggs's album of the same name.\n\nIn 2009 Topic Records included in their 70th anniversary boxed set \"Three Score and Ten\" \"Blackwater Side\" from her eponymous album as track four of the second CD in the set.\n\nThe TV show Alias Grace uses her version of the song \"Let No Man Steal Your Thyme\" as the title theme.\n\n\nBert Lloyd, Ewan MacColl, Anne Briggs et al.\n\nBert Lloyd, Anne Briggs and Frankie Armstrong\n\nTV documentary soundtrack\n\n\n"}
{"id": "153641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153641", "title": "Barbara Castle", "text": "Barbara Castle\n\nBarbara Anne Castle, Baroness Castle of Blackburn, PC, GCOT (née Betts; 6 October 1910 – 3 May 2002) was a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament for Blackburn from 1945 to 1979, making her the longest-serving female MP in the history of the House of Commons until that record was broken in 2007 by Gwyneth Dunwoody. She later became the Member of the European Parliament for Greater Manchester from 1979 to 1989 and subsequently a member of the House of Lords, having been granted a life peerage in 1990.\n\nOne of the most significant Labour Party politicians of the 20th century, Castle developed a close political partnership with Harold Wilson and served in several Cabinet roles during both his premierships. As Minister of Transport (1965–1968) she oversaw the introduction of permanent speed limits, breathalysers and seat belts. Castle was then elevated to Secretary of State for Employment and First Secretary of State (1968–1970), and successfully intervened in the strike by Ford sewing machinists against pay discrimination. Following this Castle introduced the Equal Pay Act 1970. During her time in government Castle also served as Minister for Overseas Development and Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. \n\nBarbara Anne Betts was born on 6 October 1910 at 64 Derby Road, Chesterfield, the youngest of three children to Frank Betts and his wife Annie Rebecca (née Ferrand). Raised in Pontefract and Bradford, Castle grew up in a politically active home and was introduced to socialism from a young age. Her older sister, Marjorie, later became a pioneer of the Inner London Education Authority, while their brother Tristram (almost always called Jimmie) engaged in field work with Oxfam in Nigeria. She joined the Labour Party as a teenager.\n\nHer father was a tax inspector, exempt from military service in the First World War due to his high rank in a reserved occupation. It was because of the nature of the tax-collecting profession, and the promotions he received, that the family frequently moved around the country. Having moved to Bradford in 1922, the Betts family swiftly became involved with the Independent Labour Party. Although her father was prohibited from formal political activity because of his role as a civil servant, he became editor of the \"Bradford Pioneer\", the city's socialist newspaper, after William Leach was elected to Parliament in 1935. Castle's mother ran the family home while also operating a soup kitchen for the town's coalminers. After Barbara had left home Annie was elected as a Labour Councillor in Bradford.\n\nCastle attended Love Lane Elementary School, then to Pontefract and District Girls High School. After moving to Bradford at the age of twelve, she attended Bradford Girls' Grammar School. She became involved in acting at the school and developed oratorical skills. She excelled academically, winning numerous awards from the school. She also organised mock elections at the school, in which she stood as the Labour candidate. There were some aspects of the school that she did not like, notably the presence of many girls from rich families. In her last year she was appointed Head Girl.\n\nHer education continued at St Hugh's College, Oxford, from which she graduated with a third-class BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. She began serious political activity at Oxford, serving as the Treasurer of the Oxford University Labour Club, the highest position a woman could hold in the club at the time. She struggled to accept the atmosphere of a university that had only recently begun to question iits traditionally sexist attitudes. She was scornful of the elitist nature of some elements of the institution, branding the Oxford Union \"that cadet class of the establishment\".\n\nShe was elected to St Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council in 1937, and in 1943 she spoke at the annual Labour Party Conference for the first time. Throughout the Second World War she worked as a senior administrative officer at the Ministry of Food and she was an Air Raid Precautions (ARP) warden during the Blitz.\n\nShe became a reporter on the left-wing magazine \"Tribune\", where she had a romantic relationship with William Mellor, who was to become its editor, until his death in 1942. Following her marriage to Ted Castle in 1944, she became the housing correspondent at the \"Daily Mirror\".\n\nIn the 1945 general election, which Labour won by a landslide, Castle was elected as the Member of Parliament for Blackburn. As Blackburn was then a two-member constituency, she was elected alongside fellow Labour candidate John Edwards. Castle had secured her place as a parliamentary candidate through the women of the Blackburn Labour Party, who had threatened to quit unless she was added to the otherwise all-male shortlist. \n\nCastle now held the distinction of being the youngest of the handful of women elected. Although she had grown up in similar northern industrial towns, she had no prior connection to Blackburn. Eager not to appear as a \"parachute candidate\", she studied weaving and spinning, and spent time living with a local family. In her maiden speech she highlighted the problems facing servicemen then going through demobilisation.\n\nImmediately upon her entering the House of Commons Castle was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade, who had known her as a member of the pre-war Socialist League. Harold Wilson succeeded Cripps in 1947 and retained Castle as his PPS, marking the beginning of the pair's lengthy political relationship. She gained further experience as the UK's alternate delegate to the United Nations General Assembly for 1949–1950, when she displayed particular concerned for social and humanitarian issues. She soon achieved a reputation as a left-winger and a rousing speaker. During the 1950s she was a high-profile Bevanite, and made a name for herself as a vocal advocate of decolonisation and the Anti-Apartheid Movement.\n\nLabour returned to government under Harold Wilson in October 1964 following a general election, defeating Alec Douglas-Home's Conservative government by winning a slim majority of four seats, thus ending 13 years of successive Conservative governments. Wilson had selected his core Cabinet four months prior to the election; Castle knew Wilson intended to place her within his Cabinet, which would make her the fourth woman in British history ever to hold position in a Cabinet, after Margaret Bondfield, Ellen Wilkinson and Florence Horsbrugh.\n\nCastle entered the Cabinet as the first Minister for Overseas Development, a newly created ministry for which she, alongside the Fabian Society, had drawn up the plans for. For the last year she had acted as the opposition spokeswoman on overseas development. Castle's plans were extensive, though the ministry's budget was modest. She set about trying to divert powers from other departments related to overseas aid, including the Foreign Office and the Treasury. She was only partially successful in her aims and provoked an internal Whitehall dispute in the process.\n\nIn June 1965 Castle announced interest-free aid loans would be available to certain (not exclusively Commonwealth) countries. She had previously criticised the Conservative government for granting loans that only waived up to the first seven years of interest, which she considered to be counter-intuitive. \n\nIn August, Castle published her government white paper \"Overseas Development: The Work of a New Ministry\". The financial commitments of the ministry were omitted from the report, after a protracted clash between Castle and her Cabinet colleagues James Callaghan (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and George Brown (Secretary of State for Economic Affairs). Labour had made a manifesto promise to increase aid spending to 1% of gross national product, almost double Conservative spending. However, the national economy was unstable, public resentment towards the Commonwealth was growing due to immigration, and within Cabinet aid was viewed with either indifference or contempt. Castle grappled with Callaghan and Brown over the department's budgetary allocation; they reached a compromise following Wilson's intervention, but the sum only amounted to a small increase in spending.\nInitially reluctant to head up the department, Castle accepted the role of Minister of Transport (23 December 1965 – 6 April 1968) in a Cabinet reshuffle after Wilson proved persuasive. She introduced the breathalyser to combat the then recently acknowledged crisis of drink-driving. Castle said she was \"ready to risk unpopularity\" by introducing the measures if it meant saving lives. She was challenged by a BBC journalist on \"The World This Weekend\", who described the policy as a \"rotten idea\" and asked her: \"You're only a woman, you don't drive, what do you know about it?\" \n\nCastle also made permanent the national speed limit (70 mph). Having been introduced as a four-month trial by outgoing Transport Minister Tom Fraser in December 1965, Castle first extended the limit period in 1966 and in 1967 made the limit permanent, following the findings of a Road Research Laboratory report revealing motorway casualties had fallen 20% since its introduction.\n\nCastle also sanctioned the construction of the Humber Bridge, which was the world's longest suspension bridge upon its opening in 1981. In late 1965, the Labour MP for nearby Hull North died, triggering a by-election. The marginal seat was of critical importance to the government and its loss would have reduced Labour's majority in the House of Commons to just one. Harold Wilson invoked Castle to find the necessary funding and promise the bridge's construction as an 'election sweetener'. The move paid off, with Labour holding the seat.\n\nShe presided over the closure of approximately 2,050 miles of railways as she enacted her part of the Beeching cuts—a betrayal of pre-election commitments by the Labour party to halt the proposals. Nevertheless, she refused closure of several lines, one example being the Looe Valley Line in Cornwall, and introduced the first Government rail subsidies for socially necessary but unprofitable railways in the Transport Act 1968.\n\nOne of her most memorable achievements as Transport minister was to pass legislation decreeing that all new cars had to be fitted with seat belts. Despite being appointed to the Ministry of Transport, a role which she was originally unenthusiastic about, Castle could not actually drive herself, and was chauffeured to functions. (The Labour politician Hazel Blears recalled driving Castle at one time as a young Labour Party activist in the 1980s.) Despite her lack of a driving licence, she attracted controversy when she told local government leaders to give added emphasis to motor vehicle access in urban areas, as \"most pedestrians are walking to or from their cars.\"\n\nCastle and her husband Edward Castle had bought a new flat in John Spencer Square in late 1967 while she was the Minister of Transport.\n\nAs Secretary of State for Employment, she was also appointed First Secretary of State by Wilson, bringing her firmly into the heart of government. She was never far from controversy which reached a fever pitch when the trade unions rebelled against her proposals to reduce their powers in her 1969 white paper, 'In Place of Strife'. This also involved a major cabinet split, with threatened resignations, hot tempers and her future nemesis James Callaghan breaking ranks to publicly try to undermine the bill. The whole episode alienated her from many of her friends on the left, with the Tribune newspaper railing very hard against the bill, which they held to be attacking the workers without attacking the bosses. The split is often said to be partly responsible for Labour's defeat at the 1970 general election. The eventual deal with the unions dropped most of the contentious clauses.\n\nCastle also helped make history when she intervened in the Ford sewing machinists' strike of 1968, in which the women of the Dagenham Ford Plant demanded to be paid the same as their male counterparts. She helped resolve the strike, which resulted in a pay rise for Ford's female workers bringing them to 92% of what the men received. Most significantly, as a consequence of this strike, Castle put through the Equal Pay Act 1970. A 2010 British film, \"Made in Dagenham\", was based on the Ford strike. She was portrayed by Miranda Richardson.\n\nIn April 1970, Castle's husband Ted lost his position as an alderman of the Greater London Council. He was devastated and although he was supportive of his wife’s achievements, he considered himself a failure against her. Upset and concerned by her husband's distress, Barbara moved to persuade Wilson to grant Ted a peerage.\n\nIn May 1970, Wilson called a general election, held on 18 June. The Conservative Party, led by Edward Heath, enjoyed a surprise victory, despite opinion polling indicating a steady lead for Labour in the run-up. Castle privately blamed complacency within Labour for their loss and had expressed skepticism of their poll lead, writing in her diaries: \"I have a haunting feeling there is a silent majority sitting behind its lace curtains waiting to come out and vote Tory.\" \n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the government's defeat, Castle found she was out of favour with Wilson. The day following the general election, Wilson held a final inner Cabinet meeting at Downing Street, to which Castle was not invited. Eager to make contact, she later called him at Chequers, where Wilson engaged in a brusque telephone conversation with her. \n\nRefusing to acknowledge her career had been curtailed, Castle proposed to run for deputy leadership of the Parliamentary Labour Party. When she informed Wilson of her plans he was furious; Castle's reputation within the party had been damaged by the failure of \"In Place of Strife\" and Wilson censured her, claiming her plan would split the party. In an act of retribution for her challenge to the deputy leadership, Wilson impeded Ted Castle's peerage, which he had all but promised prior to the general election. \n\nCastle remained as the Labour shadow spokesperson on Employment. The new Government introduced many of her policy suggestions as part of their Industrial Relations Act. When she was attacking the Conservative bill, the government simply pointed to her own white paper, following which Wilson reshuffled her first to the health portfolio and then out of the shadow cabinet.\n\nIn 1974, after Harold Wilson's defeat of Edward Heath, Castle became Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. While serving in this position, Castle introduced a wide range of innovative welfare reforms, including the introduction of the mobility allowance, the Invalid Care Allowance (July 1976) for single women and others who give up their jobs to care for severely disabled relatives, the introduction of a non-contributory invalidity pension for disabled persons who had not qualified for invalidity pension, reforms in child allowances, and the linking of most social security benefits to earnings rather than prices.\n\nIn the 1975 referendum debate she took a Eurosceptic stance. During a debate with Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe he asked her whether, if the vote would be yes, she would stay on as a minister. To this she replied: \"If the vote is yes my country will need me to save it.\" Despite her views she later became a Member of the European Parliament (1979–1989).\n\nIn 1975, Castle introduced the Child Benefit Act, superseding the Family Allowances Act 1945. The act provided new support for families' first child, unlike the previous system in place, which provided benefit for second and subsequent children. Castle also ensured child benefit would be paid directly to mothers, not fathers, unlike Family Allowance, the previous system in place. The legislation faced opposition from unions whose male members would receive less take-home pay with the loss of Family Allowance.\n\nCastle remained in cabinet until Wilson's resignation in March 1976. The head of the Downing Street policy unit, Bernard Donoughue, records in his diary that he warned Wilson that Castle's dogged pursuit of personal policy stances on public health would \"wreck the NHS\". Donoughue claims that Wilson agreed, but admitted he would leave it to his successor to resolve. \n\nCastle lost her place as a Cabinet minister when her bitter political enemy James Callaghan succeeded Wilson as Prime Minister following a leadership election. Although he left Wilson's Cabinet virtually unchanged, he dismissed Castle almost immediately upon taking office. Callaghan removed her under the pretext he wanted to lower the average age of his Cabinet, which she regarded as a \"phoney reason\". In an interview years later, she remarked that perhaps the most restrained thing she had ever achieved in her life was not to reply with \"Then why not start with yourself, Jim?\" (Callaghan was four years older than Wilson, the man he was replacing).\n\nDespite her Eurosceptic stance, less than a month after leaving Westminster at the 1979 general election she stood for and was elected to the European Parliament, writing in the \"Tribune\" that \"politics is not just about policies: it is about fighting for them in every available forum and at every opportunity.\" In 1982 she wrote in the \"New Statesman\" that Labour should abandon its opposition to British membership of the EEC, saying that Britain should fight its corner inside it. This led her former ally Ian Mikardo to say to her: \"Your name is mud\".\n\nShe represented Greater Manchester North from 1979–1984, and was then elected for another five years to represent Greater Manchester West from 1984–1989. She was, at that time, the only British MEP to have held a cabinet position.\n\nIn the European Parliament Castle led Labour's delegation, serving as vice-chair of the Socialist Group and as a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development and also the Delegation for relations with Malta.\n\nIn 1974, Ted Castle was made a life peer. This meant that Barbara was now formally Lady Castle, but she refused to use this courtesy title. Ted Castle died in 1979. In 1990, she was made a life peer in her own right, as Baroness Castle of Blackburn. She remained active in politics right up until her death, attacking the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown, at the Labour party conference in 2001 for his refusal to link pensions to earnings.\n\nCastle was a critic of Blairism and \"New Labour\", in particular with Blairite economic ideologies, which she perceived to be acceptance of \"market economics, unchallenged globalisation and the dominance of the multinationals\". She also accused Blairites of distorting and dismissing the Labour Party's past, stating in an interview published in the \"New Statesman\" magazine in 2000, the party's centenary:\"They do not seem to have realised that all governments, whatever their complexion, end in apparent failure. Macmillan was triumphant in 1959 and was biting the dust shortly afterwards. Heath won in 1970 and spent three and half years doing U-turns, looking for the perfect answer. Thatcher was a remarkable woman, but her premiership ended in ignominy. But the current leadership seems preoccupied by the failing of Labour in power and in opposition.\"\n\nBarbara Castle died in Chiltern, Buckinghamshire, on 3 May 2002, of pneumonia and chronic lung disease.\n\nCastle has been acknowledged as the most important female Labour politician of the 20th century. An adept and gripping orator, Castle garnered a reputation as a strong-willed, sometimes single-minded crusader. Political commentator Andrew Marr wrote of Castle in 1993: \"Performance has been at the centre of her career. She makes excellent television and was a good Commons speaker. But she was really made for the platform, either at Labour conferences or during election campaigns. There, her wit, self-confidence and theatricality were displayed. A good Castle speech is unforgettable.\" \n\nShe was admired by Bill Deedes, Conservative politician and editor of \"The Daily Telegraph\", for \"her astonishing tenacity, her capacity for getting her own way in Cabinet and nearly everywhere else,\" though he derided her politics. To her allies, Castle was loyal and would fiercely defend them. Colleague Roy Hattersley credited her with saving his career by insisting he remain her junior Minister when Harold Wilson attempted to sack him. Nevertheless, she remained unforgiving of her enemies; when questioned on James Callaghan in a 2000 interview in the \"New Statesman\", Castle said: \"I think it is safest all round if I don't comment on him.\"\n\nReferred to disparagingly by fellow Labour MP Gerald Kaufman as \"the Norma Desmond of politics [...] always ready for her close-up\", she was noted for always paying particular attention to her appearance. Variously described as sophisticated, stylish and glamorous, Castle was also characterised as vain, while her critics called her egocentric. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock recalled she was distraught when her hairdresser cancelled before a television appearance; in response, Castle said: \"If you're a woman in the public eye, getting your hair nice is a constant preoccupation.\" Her weekly appointments with her hairdresser were \"an essential Friday engagement\" according to Hattersley, although she occasionally wore a wig – which she nicknamed Lucy – for public appearances without the benefit of her hairdresser to hand.\nIn 2008, Castle was named by \"The Guardian\" as one of four of \"Labour's greatest heroes\" and in 2016 she was named on BBC Radio 4's \"Woman's Hour\" Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women's lives over the past 70 years, alongside Margaret Thatcher, Helen Brook, Germaine Greer, Jayaben Desai, Bridget Jones, and Beyoncé. Several women politicians have cited Castle as an inspiration for embarking on their careers, including Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry, Tulip Siddiq, and former Conservative MP Edwina Curry.\n\nSince Castle's death there have been several plans mooted to memorialise her with a statue in her constituency town of Blackburn, most recently in 2018. In the town a dual carriageway that constitutes part of the ring road is named Barbara Castle Way. She was commemorated on a postage stamp issued as part of the Royal Mail's Women of Distinction series in 2008 for piloting the Equal Pay Act through parliament. She appears on the 81p denomination.\n\nCastle was portrayed by British actress Miranda Richardson in the 2010 film \"Made in Dagenham\", dealing with the 1968 strike at the Ford Dagenham assembly plant. She was later portrayed by stage actress Sophie-Louise Dann in the 2014 West End musical adaptation of the film.\n\nBarbara Castle was the recipient of \"The Order of the Companions of OR Tambo in Silver\", a South African award to foreign nationals for friendship with that country. In a statement the South African government recognised Castle's \"outstanding contribution to the struggle against apartheid and the establishment of a non-sexist, non-racial and democratic South Africa\". This can be seen throughout Castle's career with her active support for the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) in Britain from the very start of its existence and her continued interest and devotion to colonial issues within Parliament.\n\nIn 2002 Castle was posthumously awarded an honorary degree from the Open University. The award, Doctor of the University, was presented for Public Services for works in areas of special educational concern to the OU.\n\nCastle also received a Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990, for services to European democracy.\n\nIn September 2008 Northern Rail, Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council and PTEG (Passenger transport executive Group) named a train after her. The plaque was unveiled by Barbara's niece, Sonya Hinton, and Ruth Kelly MP (then Secretary of State for Transport). A commemorative brochure of the event was produced by PTEG.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n"}

Police officials connected him to at least 51 murder victims, mainly women, killed in a 15-year period, which began in 1928 and ended with his arrest in 1943. He was never given a trial, and is generally considered innocent these days.\n\nBorn in Köpenick, Lüdke had a mild intellectual disability (he could not, for example, tell interrogators how many minutes there were in an hour) and worked as a coachman. He was well known by the local police as a petty thief and peeping tom. On 31 January 1943 a woman was found murdered in the woods near Köpenick, strangled with her own shawl. The victim showed signs of post-mortem sexual abuse and her purse was missing. Police brought in Lüdke for questioning on 18 March 1943, where he quickly confessed to murdering not only the woman but also several other victims, and was taken into custody. Witnesses report Lüdke showed signs of physical abuse and he stated that 'they would kill me if I didn't confess'.\nLüdke was never put on trial for any of the killings. Declared insane, he was sent to the SS-run 'Institute of Criminological Medicine' in Vienna, where medical experiments were carried out on him until his death when an experiment went wrong in 1944.\n\nThe 50-odd crime scenes showed no similarities in modus operandi, signature, or motive. No fingerprints were ever found and no evidence against Lüdke has ever been presented.\n\nA Dutch former Chief of police named Jan Blaauw took an interest in the case and investigated original police reports. He found them inconclusive, incoherent, and vague. He also expressed his disbelief that a semi-illiterate, who once got caught stealing a chicken, could evade authorities for nearly 20 years, let alone get away with murder.\n\nMany believe Lüdke to be the victim of a frame-up, carried out by an ambitious Kriminalkommissar (Detective Captain) Franz, the heavily censored Reichskriminalpolizeiamt, and the Nazi government, that had little patience with people with intellectual disabilities. \n\nA 1957 movie, \"Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam\", affirmed the image of Lüdke as one of Germany's worst serial killers. Attempts at reopening the case by members of the Kriminalrat (Detective Major) Faulhaber yielded no results. The true nature of the 51 murders remains unsolved to this day.\n"}

Totten\n\nCharles Adelle Lewis Totten (February 3, 1851 – April 12, 1908) was an American military officer, a professor of military tactics, a prolific writer, and an influential early advocate of British Israelism.\n\nCharles Totten was born in New London, Connecticut into a military family. His father, James Totten was a 1st lieutenant in the Army and would become a Brigadier-General in the Missouri Militia during the American Civil War. He was the grandfather of Lieutenant General William P. Ennis who served during World War II and the Korean War. He was not directly related to Brevet Major General Joseph Gilbert Totten, who was Chief of the United States Army Corps of Engineers from 1838 to 1864. \n\nTotten's brother, John Reynolds Totten, graduated from West Point in 1878, was promoted to first lieutenant in 1886 and resigned from the Army on April 1, 1891. After leaving the Army, he pursued his interests in genealogy and hereditary societies.\n\nTotten was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point on September 1, 1869. A year later, his father was dismissed from the Army for misconduct.\n\nTotten graduated from West Point (where he had been an honor student) in June 1873. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Artillery Regiment. He was promoted to first lieutenant the next year. He would not be promoted again, however, due to slow promotions in the post-Civil War Army.\n\nHe taught military science and tactics at Massachusetts Agricultural College, (now known as the University of Massachusetts Amherst) from 1875 to 1878. In this assignment he introduced fencing as a collegiate sport.\n\nCharles Totten and W. R. Livermore are variously credited with being the first to bring the practice of war gaming from Germany to the United States. Totten's book \"Strategos\", one of the first modern wargaming systems in the United States, was published in 1880.\n\nIn 1881 Totten participated in the Chiricahua Campaign against the Apaches in Arizona. For this service, Totten was entitled to receive the Indian Campaign Medal when it was established in 1907.\n\nHe was stationed at Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island from November 9, 1882 to August 1, 1883. He then served as Professor of Military Science and Tactics, Cathedral School of St. Paul in New York from August 4, 1883 until April 21, 1886. A strong opponent of the Metric System, he patented a system of weights and measures in 1884.\n\nHe was again assigned to Fort Adams, as well as serving as an advisor at Rhode Island Militia encampments, from May 30, 1886 until October 1, 1889. His last assignment in the Army was as Professor of Military Science and Tactics at Yale University from August 1, 1889 until 1892.\n\nAfter a leave of absence, Totten resigned his commission in August 1893 and settled in Milford, Connecticut with his office in New Haven. He devoted most of his remaining life to writing, chiefly on biblical chronology, biblical prophecy, the Great Pyramid, British Israelism, the symbolism of the Great Seal of the United States and other esoteric subjects.\n\nHe was a prolific author, writing over 180 books and articles, including a massive 26 volume series entitled \"Our Race\" defending British Israelism, and his writings continue to exert influence in some Christian Zionist circles. Totten's works were read and embraced by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science Church. British Israelism was later embraced by Herbert W. Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God and the white supremacist Christian Identity movement.\n\nAs an active member of the International Institute for Preserving and Perfecting (Anglo-Saxon) Weights and Measures, Totten wrote its theme song, \"A Pint's a Pound the World Around,\" in 1883, which included these lines:\n\n\nCullum's Register of Graduates of the United States Military Academy Vols.

He ran the Russia desk at MI6 headquarters in London between 2006 and 2009. In 2009 he co-founded Orbis Business Intelligence, a London-based private intelligence firm. He authored a dossier that claims Russia collected a file of compromising information on U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nChristopher David Steele was born in the Yemeni city of Aden (then part of the Federation of South Arabia), on 24 June 1964. His parents, Perris and Janet, had met while working at the Met Office, the United Kingdom's national weather service. His paternal grandfather was a coal miner from Pontypridd in Wales. Steele spent time growing up in Aden, the Shetland Islands, and Cyprus, as well as at Wellington College, Berkshire.\n\nSteele matriculated at Girton College, Cambridge in 1982. While at the University of Cambridge, he wrote for the student newspaper, \"Varsity\". In the Easter term of 1986, Steele was President of The Cambridge Union debating society. He graduated with a degree in Social and Political Sciences in 1986.\n\nSteele was recruited by MI6 directly following his graduation from Cambridge, working in London at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) from 1987 to 1989. From 1990 to 1993, Steele worked under diplomatic cover as an MI6 agent in Moscow, serving at the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Moscow. Steele was an \"internal traveller\", visiting newly-accessible cities such as Samara and Kazan.\n\nHe returned to London in 1993, working again at the FCO until his posting with the British Embassy in Paris in 1998, where he served under diplomatic cover until 2002. But Steele's identity as an MI6 officer and a hundred and sixteen other British spies had their cover blown by an anonymously published list that Her Majesty's Government attempted to suppress through a DSMA-Notice in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Steele was sent to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan as part of an MI6 team, briefing Special Forces on \"kill or capture\" missions for Taliban targets, and also spent time teaching new MI6 recruits. Steele returned to London and between 2006 and 2009 he headed the Russia Desk at MI6.\n\nSteele's expertise on Russia remained valued, and he served as a senior officer under John Scarlett, Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), from 2004 to 2009. Steele was selected as case officer for Alexander Litvinenko and participated in the investigation of the Litvinenko poisoning in 2006. It was Steele who quickly realised that Litvinenko's death \"was a Russian state 'hit. Twelve years later he allegedly was included himself into a hit list of the Russian Federal Security Service, along with Sergei Skripal who was poisoned in 2018 by a binary chemical weapon Novichok in Britain.\n\nSince 2009 Steele has not been to Russia, or visited any former Soviet states and in 2012, an Orbis informant quoted an FSB-agent describing him as an \"enemy of Mother Russia\". Steele has refrained from travelling to the United States since his identity became public, citing the political and legal situation.\n\nIn March 2009, Steele with his fellow MI6-retiree Chris Burrows co-founded the private intelligence agency Orbis Business Intelligence, Ltd., based in Grosvenor Square Gardens. Between 2014 and 2016, Steele created over 100 reports on Russian and Ukrainian issues, which were read within the United States Department of State, and he was viewed as credible by the United States intelligence community. The business was commercially successful, grossing approximately $20,000,000 in the first nine years of operation.\n\nSteele ran an investigation dubbed \"Project Charlemagne\", which noted Russian interference in the domestic politics of France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Steele concluded in April 2016 that Russia was engaged in an information warfare campaign with the goal of destroying the European Union.\n\nIn 2017, Steele established a new company called Chawton Holdings, again with Christopher Burrows. In November 2018, Steele sued the German industrial group Bilfinger, alleging that the company owed €150,000 for an investigation into Bilfinger's activities in Nigeria and Sakhalin.\n\nIn 2010, The Football Association (FA), England's domestic football governing body, organized a committee in hopes of hosting the 2018 or 2022 World Cups. The FA hired Steele's company to investigate FIFA (International Federation of Association Football). In advance of the FBI launching its 2015 FIFA corruption case, members of the FBI's Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force met with Steele in London to discuss allegations of possible corruption in FIFA. Steele's research indicated that Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin had rigged the bidding of the 2018 World Cups by employing bribery.\n\nIn September 2015, the \"Washington Free Beacon\", a conservative publication, retained the services of Fusion GPS, a private Washington D.C. political research firm, to conduct research on several primary Republican Party candidates including candidate Trump. The research was unrelated to Russia and was ended once Trump was determined to be the presidential nominee.\n\nThe firm was subsequently hired by the Hillary Clinton Campaign and the Democratic National Committee through their shared attorney at Perkins Coie, Marc Elias. Fusion GPS then hired Steele to investigate Trump's Russia-related activities. According to CNN, Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee took over the financing of the inquiry into Donald Trump and produced what became known as the Trump dossier.\n\nIn July 2016, Steele supplied a report he had written to an FBI agent in Rome. His contact at the FBI was the same senior agent with whom he had worked when investigating the FIFA scandal.\n\nIn September 2016, Steele held a series of off the record meetings with journalists from \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", Yahoo! News, \"The New Yorker\" and CNN. In October 2016, Steele spoke about his discoveries to David Corn of the progressive American political magazine \"Mother Jones\". Steele said he decided to pass his dossier to both British and American intelligence officials after concluding that the material should not just be in the hands of political opponents of Trump, but was a matter of national security for both countries. Corn's resulting 31 October article in \"Mother Jones\" was the first to publicly mention the dossier, although the article did not disclose Steele's identity. The magazine did not publish the dossier itself, however, or detail its allegations, since they could not be verified.\n\nSteele continued to work for Fusion GPS on the dossier without a client to pay him. After the election, Steele's dossier \"became one of Washington's worst-kept secrets, and journalists worked to verify the allegations. On 18 November 2016, Sir Andrew Wood, British ambassador to Moscow from 1995 to 2000, met with U.S. Senator John McCain at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada, and told McCain about the existence of the collected materials about Trump. Wood vouched for Steele's professionalism and integrity. In early December, McCain obtained a copy of the dossier from David J. Kramer, a former U.S. State Department official working at Arizona State University. On 9 December 2016, McCain met personally with FBI Director James Comey to pass on the information.\n\nIn a second memo Steele wrote in November 2016, after the termination of his contract with Fusion, he reported that Russian officials had claimed that Russia had blocked Donald Trump from nominating Mitt Romney to be his Secretary of State, due to Romney's hawkishness on Russia.\n\nOn 11 January 2017, \"The Wall Street Journal\" revealed that Steele was the author of the dossier about Trump, citing \"people familiar with the matter\". Although the dossier's existence had been \"common knowledge\" among journalists for months at that point and had become public knowledge during the previous week, Steele's name had not been revealed. \"The Telegraph\" asserted that Steele's anonymity had been \"fatally compromised\" after CNN published his nationality.\n\n\"The Independent\" reported that Steele left his home in England several hours before his name was published as the author of the dossier, as he was fearful of retaliation by Russian authorities. In contrast, \"The Washington Post\" reported that he left after he had been identified earlier in the day by the initial \"Wall Street Journal\" report.\n\nChristopher Burrows, director of Orbis Business Intelligence, Ltd., said he would not \"confirm or deny\" that Orbis had produced the dossier.\n\nSteele's relationship with the FBI ended, variously associated with either the public revelation of Steele's identity, or Steele's release of information to the press, or Steele's denial to the FBI of having spoken to the press. One source dates this event to late October 2016.\n\nOn 7 March 2017, as some members of the United States Congress were expressing interest in meeting with or hearing testimony from Steele, he reemerged after weeks in hiding, appearing publicly on camera and stating, \"I'm really pleased to be back here working again at the Orbis's offices in London today\".\n\nIn early January 2017, a two-page summary of the Trump dossier was presented to President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump in meetings with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.\n\nOn 10 January 2017, \"BuzzFeed\" was the first media outlet to publish the full 35-page dossier. In publishing the Trump dossier, BuzzFeed stated that it had been unable to verify or corroborate the allegations. The UK issued a DSMA notice on 10 January 2017, requesting that the media not release Steele's identity, although the BBC and other UK news media released the information in news stories the same day. Trump vigorously denied the dossier's allegations, calling it fake news during a press conference. Vladimir Putin also dismissed the claims.\n\nYnet, an Israeli online news site, reported that American intelligence advised Israeli intelligence officers to be cautious about sharing information with the incoming Trump administration, until the possibility of Russian influence over Trump, suggested by Steele's report, has been fully investigated.\n\nFormer British ambassador to Russia, Sir Tony Brenton, read Steele's report. Speaking on Sky News he said, \"I've seen quite a lot of intelligence on Russia, and there are some things in it which look pretty shaky\". Brenton expressed some doubts due to discrepancies in how the dossier described aspects of the hacking activities, as well as Steele's ability to penetrate the Kremlin and Russian security agencies, given that he is an outsider.\n\nOn 15 March 2017, former Acting CIA Director Michael Morell raised questions about the dossier. He was concerned about the accuracy of the information, due to the approach taken by Steele to gather it. Steele gave money to intermediaries and the intermediaries paid the sources. Morell said, \"Unless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can't judge the information – you just can't\". Morell continues to believe that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, two Republican staffers for the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence travelled to London to investigate the dossier, visiting the office of Steele's lawyer but not meeting with Steele. In August 2018, Representative Devin Nunes, Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, travelled to London in an attempt to meet with the heads of MI5, MI6, and GCHQ for information about Steele, but was rebuffed by the three agencies.\n\nSteele reportedly revealed the identities of the sources used in the dossier to the FBI. Investigators from Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation team met with Steele in September 2017 to interview him about the dossier's claims. The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is in continued contact with lawyers representing Steele.\n\nIn February 2017, lawyers for Russian internet entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev filed a libel suit against Steele in London. Gubarev claimed he was defamed by allegations in the dossier.\n\nIn August 2017, lawyers for Gubarev demanded Steele give a deposition regarding the dossier, as part of a libel lawsuit against BuzzFeed News filed in February. Steele objected to testifying but his objections were rejected by U.S. District Court Judge Ursula Mancusi Ungaro, who allowed the deposition to proceed.\n\nIn April 2018, Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and German Khan – the owners of Alfa Bank – filed a libel suit against Steele, who mentioned the bank in the Trump–Russia dossier. The lawsuit is filed in Washington D.C. The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Anthony C. Epstein on August 20, 2018.\n\nOn 5 January 2018, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, joined by senior Republican member Lindsey Graham, issued a criminal referral regarding Steele to the Justice Department for it to investigate whether Steele had lied to the FBI about his interactions with the media. Because the referral is based on classified FBI documents, the context in which the Republican senators allege Steele to have lied is limited to references that he discussed the dossier with media outlets. Both Grassley and Graham declared that they were not alleging that Steele \"had committed any crime. Rather, they had passed on the information for 'further investigation only'\".<ref name=\"BBC_News_1/5/2018\"></ref>\n\nThe referral was met with skepticism from legal experts, as well as members of both parties on the Judiciary Committee. Fusion GPS lawyer Joshua A. Levy said that the referral was just another effort to discredit the investigation into Russian interference in the election and that: \"After a year of investigations into Donald Trump's ties to Russia, the only person Republicans seek to accuse of wrongdoing is one who reported on these matters to law enforcement in the first place\". Veteran prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg called the referral \"nonsense\" because \"the FBI doesn't need any prompting from politicians to prosecute people who have lied to them.\" Another former federal prosecutor, Justin Dillon said that \"it was too early to assume the letter was simply a political attack\". The senior Democrat on the Committee, Diane Feinstein, said that the referral was made without consultation of any Democrats on the committee and released a five-page rebuttal. A Republican aide said that Grassley and Graham were \"carrying water for the White House\"; that their actions did not reflect the views of the committee as a whole; and that other members were upset with Grassley over the matter.\n\nIn an opinion-editorial for \"Politico\", former CIA official John Sipher said that the attacks on Steele, a private citizen who provided information to the FBI that alarmed him, will make future tipsters less likely to approach American law enforcement with information that bears on national security.\n\nHis first wife, Laura, with whom he had three children, died in 2009 after a long illness. He remarried in 2012; he and his second wife Katherine had one child and are raising all four children together.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "724914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=724914", "title": "Corrie ten Boom", "text": "Corrie ten Boom\n\nCornelia Arnolda Johanna \"Corrie\" ten Boom (15 April 1892 – 15 April 1983) was a Dutch watchmaker and later a writer, who worked with her father and other family members to help many Jews escape the Nazi Holocaust during World War II by hiding them in her home. They were caught and she was arrested and sent to a Nazi concentration camp (Ravensbrück concentration camp). Her most famous book, \"The Hiding Place\", is a biography that recounts the story of her family's efforts and how ten Boom found hope while imprisoned at the concentration camp. \n\nCorrie ten Boom was born on 15 April 1892 to a working class family in Amsterdam, Netherlands, near Haarlem. Named after her mother Cornelia but known as \"Corrie\" all her life, she was the youngest child of Casper ten Boom, a jeweler and watchmaker. Her father was fascinated by the craft of watchmaking and often became so engrossed in his own work that he forgot to charge customers for the services.\n\nShe trained to be a watchmaker herself and in 1922 became the first woman licensed as a watchmaker in The Netherlands. Over the next decade, in addition to working in her father's shop, she established a youth club for teenage girls, which provided religious instruction as well as classes in the performing arts, sewing and handicrafts. She and her family were Calvinists in the Dutch Reformed Church, and their faith inspired them to serve their society, offering shelter, food, and money to those in need.\n\nIn May 1940 the Nazis invaded the Netherlands. Among their restrictions was banning the youth club. In May 1942 a well-dressed woman came to the ten Booms' with a suitcase in hand and told them that she was a Jew, her husband had been arrested several months before, her son had gone into hiding, and Occupation authorities had recently visited her, so she was afraid to go back. She had heard that the ten Booms had helped their Jewish neighbors, the Weils, and asked if they might help her too. Casper ten Boom readily agreed that she could stay with them, despite the police headquarters being only half a block away. A devoted reader of the Old Testament, he believed that the Jews were the \"chosen people\", and he told the woman, \"In this household, God's people are always welcome.\" The family then became very active in the Dutch underground hiding refugees; they honored the Jewish Sabbath. The family never sought to convert any of the Jews who stayed with them.\n\nThus the ten Booms began \"The Hiding Place\", or \"De Schuilplaats\", as it was known in Dutch (also known as \"de Béjé\", pronounced in Dutch as 'bayay', an abbreviation of their street address, the Barteljorisstraat). Corrie ten Boom and her sister Betsie opened their home to refugees — both Jews and others who were members of the resistance movement — being sought by the Gestapo and its Dutch counterpart. They had plenty of room, although wartime shortages meant that food was scarce. Every non-Jewish Dutch person had received a ration card, the requirement for obtaining weekly food coupons. Through her charitable work, ten Boom knew many people in Haarlem and remembered a couple who had a disabled daughter. The father was a civil servant who by then was in charge of the local ration-card office. She went to his house one evening, and when he asked how many ration cards she needed, \"I opened my mouth to say, 'Five,'\" ten Boom wrote in \"The Hiding Place\". \"But the number that unexpectedly and astonishingly came out instead was: 'One hundred.'\" He gave them to her and she provided cards to every Jew she met.\n\nThe refugee work done at the Beje by ten Boom and her sister became known by the Dutch Resistance. The Resistance sent an architect to the ten Boom home to build a secret room adjacent to ten Boom's room for the Jews in hiding, as well as an alert buzzer to warn the refugees to get into the room as quickly as possible.\n\nOn February 28, 1944, a Dutch informant named Jan Vogel told the Nazis about the ten Booms' work; at around 12:30 P.M. the Nazis arrested the entire ten Boom family. They were sent to Scheveningen prison when Resistance materials and extra ration cards were found at the home. Nollie and Willem were released immediately along with Corrie's nephew Peter; Casper died 10 days later. The six people hidden by the ten Booms, among them both Jews and resistance workers, remained undiscovered: Corrie ten Boom received a letter one day in prison reading \"All the watches in your cabinet are safe,\" meaning the refugees had managed to escape and were safe. Four days after the raid, resistance workers transferred them to other locations. Altogether, the Gestapo arrested some 30 people in the ten Boom family home that day.\n\nTen Boom was initially held in solitary confinement. After three months, she was taken to her first hearing. On trial, ten Boom spoke about her work with the mentally disabled; the Nazi lieutenant scoffed, as the Nazis had been killing mentally disabled individuals for years based on their eugenics ideologies. Ten Boom defended her work, saying that in the eyes of God, a mentally disabled person might be more valuable \"than a watchmaker. Or a lieutenant.\"\n\nCorrie and Betsie were sent from Scheveningen to Herzogenbusch, a political concentration camp (also known as Kamp Vught), and finally to the Ravensbrück concentration camp, a women's labor camp in Germany. There they held worship services, after the hard days at work, using a Bible that they had managed to sneak in. While at Ravensbruck, Betsie ten Boom began to discuss plans with her sister after the war for a place of healing. Betsie's health continued to deteriorate and she died on December 16, 1944 at the age of 59. Before she died, she told Corrie, \"There is no pit so deep that He [God] is not deeper still.\" Fifteen days later, Corrie was released. Afterwards, she was told that her release was due to a clerical error and that a week later, all the women in her age group were sent to the gas chambers.\n\nCorrie ten Boom returned home in the midst of the \"hunger winter.\" She opened her doors still to the mentally disabled who were in hiding for fear of execution.\n\nAfter the war, ten Boom returned to The Netherlands to set up a rehabilitation center in Bloemendaal. The refugee houses housed of concentration-camp survivors and sheltered the jobless Dutch who previously collaborated with Germans during the Occupation exclusively until 1950, when it accepted anyone in need of care. She returned to Germany in 1946, and met with and forgave two Germans who had been employed at Ravensbruck, one of whom was particularly cruel to Betsie. Ten Boom went on to travel the world as a public speaker, appearing in more than 60 countries. She wrote many books during this time.\n\nCorrie Ten Boom told the story of her family members and their World War II work in her best-selling book, \"The Hiding Place\" (1971), which was made into a 1975 World Wide Pictures film, \"The Hiding Place\", starring Jeannette Clift as Corrie and Julie Harris as Betsie. In 1977, 85-year-old Corrie emigrated to Placentia, California. In 1978, she suffered two strokes, the first rendering her unable to speak, and the second resulting in paralysis. She died on her 91st birthday, 15 April 1983, after a third stroke.\n\nA sequel film, \"Return to the Hiding Place (War of Resistance)\", was released in 2011 in the United Kingdom, with its United States release in 2013, based on Hans Poley's book, which painted a wider picture of the circle of which she was a part.\n\n\n\n"}

He ran a \"no money in politics\" campaign on social media, featuring the hashtag \"#FeelTheChern\".\n\nOn May 24, 1990, Cherney was injured when a pipe bomb exploded in the car he and Judi Bari were traveling in. Bari was severely injured by the explosion. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which accused Bari and Cherney of bombing themselves. Bari and Cherney subsequently sued the FBI and Oakland Police agents for violations of the United States Constitution. Cherney and the late Bari's estate were awarded $4.4 million for violations of the First Amendment (freedom of speech) and the Fourth Amendment (the right to be free from unlawful arrest and illegal search and seizure).\n\nIn 2012, Cherney told KHUM radio that he does not consider himself an \"extremist,\" preferring the term \"radical.\" In 2012, Cherney's documentary film \"Who Bombed Judi Bari?\" was released. There is an ongoing lawsuit against the FBI to prevent it from destroying evidence that could contain the bomber's DNA, and Cherney indicated in a Democracy Now interview that he believes the FBI was guilty of not only framing him and Judi but of a cover-up. Cherney has stated elsewhere that “I believe the bomber is findable.” In October 2012, Cherney announced a $50,000 reward “for information leading to the identification, arrest, prosecution and incarceration of the person or persons responsible for the attempted assassination of Judi Bari by placing a bomb under the seat of her car.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its most notable member was Charles Darwin, a grandson of both. The family included at least ten Fellows of the Royal Society and several artists and poets (including the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams). Presented below are brief biographical descriptions and genealogical information with links to articles on the members. The individuals are listed by year of birth and grouped into generations. The relationship to Francis Galton and his immediate ancestors is also given. Note that the data tree below does not include all descendants or even all prominent descendants.\n\nJosiah Wedgwood (1730–1795) was a noted pottery businessman and a friend of Erasmus Darwin. During 1780, on the death of his long-time business partner Thomas Bentley, Josiah asked Darwin for help in managing the business. As a result of the close association that grew up between the Wedgwood and Darwin families, one of Josiah's daughters later married Erasmus's son Robert. One of the children of that marriage, Charles Darwin, also married a Wedgwood – Emma, Josiah's granddaughter. Robert's inheritance of Josiah's money enabled him to fund Charles Darwin's chosen vocation in natural history that resulted in the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution. Subsequently Emma's inheritance made the Darwins a wealthy family.\n\nJosiah Wedgwood married Sarah Wedgwood (1734–1815), and they had seven children, including:\n\nErasmus Darwin (1731–1802) was a physician, botanist and poet from Lichfield, whose lengthy botanical poems gave insights into medicine and natural history, and described an evolutionist theory that anticipated both Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and his grandson Charles. He married twice, first during 1757 to Mary Howard (1740–1770), who died from alcohol-induced liver failure aged 31. She gave birth to:\n\n\nHe then had an extra-marital affair with a Miss Parker, producing two daughters:\n\n\nHe then became smitten with Elizabeth Collier Sacheveral-Pole, who was married to Colonel Sacheveral-Pole and was the natural daughter of the Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore.

He married Lucy Barclay (1757–1817), daughter of Robert Barclay Allardice, MP, 5th of Urie. They had the eight children:\n\nThe son of Erasmus Darwin, Robert Darwin was a noted physician from Shrewsbury, whose own income as a physician, together with astute investment of his inherited wealth, enabled him to fund his son Charles Darwin's place on the Voyage of the Beagle and then gave him the private income needed to support Charles' chosen vocation in natural history that led to the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution. He married Susannah Wedgwood, daughter of Josiah Wedgwood (see above), and they had the following children.\n\nJosiah Wedgwood (1769 – 1843) was the son of the first Josiah Wedgwood, and Member of Parliament for Stoke-on-Trent.

Francis was an accomplished travel writer, explorer and naturalist and bravely studied the ravages of the plague on Smyrna at great personal risk. He was the only one to return of his friends who went to the East. A physician to George III, he was knighted by George IV.\n\nOn 16 December 1815 he married Jane Harriet Ryle (11 December 1794 – 19 April 1866) at St. George, Hanover Square London. They had many children including:\n\nThe most prominent member of the family, Charles Darwin, proposed the first coherent theory of evolution by means of natural and sexual selection.\n\nCharles Robert Darwin (1809–1882) was a son of Robert Waring Darwin and Susannah Wedgwood. He married Emma Wedgwood, (1808–1896) a daughter of Josiah Wedgwood II and Elizabeth Allen. Charles's mother, Susannah, was a sister to Emma's father, Josiah II. Thus, Charles and Emma were first cousins.\n\nThe Darwins had ten children, three of whom died before reaching maturity.\n\nThe Rev. William Darwin Fox (1805–1880) was a second cousin of Charles Darwin and an amateur entomologist, naturalist and palaeontologist. Fox became a lifelong friend of Charles Darwin after their first meeting at Christ's College, Cambridge.

During the period being discussed, Josiah Wedgwood married his third cousin Sarah Wedgwood; Charles Darwin married his first cousin Emma Wedgwood; his sister, Caroline Darwin, married Emma's brother (and Caroline's first cousin), Josiah Wedgwood III. There were other instances of cousin marriage as well. Cousin marriage was not uncommon in Britain during the 19th century though why is debated: poorer communications, keeping wealth within the family, more opportunity of evaluating a relative of the opposite sex as a suitable marriage partner (unmarried young women of the upper and upper middle classes were closely chaperoned when meeting men outside the family during the 19th century), more security for the woman as she would not be leaving her family (though legal rights for married women increased during the century, as a rule her property became his and she had little legal recourse if he chose to abuse her).\n\nThese arms were granted to Reginald Darwin, of Fern, Derbyshire, for himself and certain descendants of his father, Sir Francis Sacheverel Darwin, and his uncle Robert Waring Darwin (Father of Charles), on 6 March 1890. As Charles Darwin was part of the destination, they have been used in association with him, despite being granted after his death. Something similar is used by Darwin College, Cambridge.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "713982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=713982", "title": "Doctor Light (Arthur Light)", "text": "Doctor Light (Arthur Light)\n\nDoctor Light is a bipartite character, comprising supervillain Arthur Light and superhero Jacob Finlay, appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. \n\nHis stint as Doctor Light is concurrent with that of a superheroine using the same name and nearly identical costume, Kimiyo Hoshi. In 2009, Doctor Light was ranked as IGN's 84th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.\n\nDoctor Light first appeared in \"Justice League of America\" #12 and was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky.\n\nDuring the 1980s Doctor Light was transitioned from a serious menace to a comedic villain, a transformation which culminated in the DC Comics Bonus Book appearing in \"The Flash\" #12 (May 1988).\n\nCriminal physicist Doctor Arthur Light captures the League with light rays after first drawing them in by capturing Aquaman, then sending the League to different planets based on their weaknesses. He then orders Snapper Carr to write this down, before imprisoning him in a light field. He has not realised Superman and Batman impersonated each other, allowing Superman to escape the world he was sent to and rescue the other members. Light fools the League with three duplicates of himself that are apparently committing robberies of light-associated objects, though they are actually placing devices around the world. Green Lantern realizes this trick and fakes his death to track Doctor Light, finally stopping him before he pulls the lever that would have set off the light impulses allowing him to take over the world. A retcon introduced in \"Secret Origins\" #37 reveals that this character is actually the second Doctor Light. According to the retcon, his predecessor was his partner at S.T.A.R. Labs, a scientist named Jacob Finlay. Finlay created a technologically advanced suit to control light allowing him to be a minor superhero, but was accidentally killed by Arthur Light (though Finlay's death may have been caused by hiding his costume in a computer console, causing it to malfunction). Light took the suit and the \"Doctor Light\" codename. He is periodically haunted by Finlay's ghost through the years, but can use the light generated by the suit to drive off this spirit.\n\nThrough the Silver and Bronze Ages, Doctor Light is a minor but persistent foe for a number of heroes. He fights the Justice League's former sidekicks, the Teen Titans. In \"JLA\" #136, he is one of King Kull's agents with which the Beast-Man hopes to wipe out humanity on all three Earths, helping in the attack on Earth-S by creating perpetual light and darkness on each side of the Earth, and teaming up with the Shade. He is turned to stone by King Kull's satellites, but restored when they are destroyed. He is beaten by Hal Jordan not long after his defeat by the JLA. He then founds the supervillain team the Fearsome Five, but they are also defeated by the Titans, and Light is violently expelled from the Five by his teammates. Each criminal caper leads to Light's defeat, but these defeats were used later as the basis of his humiliation that culminated in the \"Identity Crisis\" storyline.\n\nDr. Light was once defeated by Little Boy Blue and his Blue Boys—a group of non-superpowered children.\n\nDriven by self-doubt and guilt, thanks in part to Finlay's ghostly presence, he volunteers for the Suicide Squad, a group of incarcerated supervillains who perform dangerous missions for the US government in exchange for clemency. On a mission against the patriotism-themed super-team called the \"Force of July\", he encounters Sparkler, the Force's youngest member. The presence of a superpowered child reminds him of past defeats and he lashes out, killing Sparkler with a blast through the chest.\n\nDuring his time with the Squad, Light demonstrates a simple desire to be liked by the other members. He sees his chance when a mysterious pie-armed attacker is on the loose but after faking a hit nobody actually believes Light has been pied.\n\nFinally, Finlay's ghost convinces Light to attempt a heroic turn during a mission where multiple members of the team, some unwillingly, have traveled to Apokolips. Light is swiftly shot dead by Parademons. Light is sent to Hell, where he is physically reunited with Finlay. Under the watch of a lesser demon and its annoying assistant, both men are released from Hell in turns and returned to life. Both only soon die again: Arthur Light suffocates while still inside his grave, while the desiccated Finlay claws his way out of his own grave but is killed by a family of religious vigilantes. Arthur Light is again returned to life, and barely survives a fall that his demonic tormentors may have intended to be fatal. Arthur also possesses the body of the female Doctor Light, Kimiyo Hoshi. With the aide of her teacher, Kimiyo rejects Arthur's presence. Doctor Light, freed of his ex-partner's hauntings, attempts to rejoin the Suicide Squad, but his appeal is summarily rejected by Amanda Waller.\n\nHe later becomes trapped in a Green Lantern power battery which would eventually came under the possession of Kyle Rayner, and as a consequence is temporarily transformed into living light. He later joins a short-lived incarnation of the Injustice Gang, in which he assists Lex Luthor in building holographic duplicates of the JLA.\n\nThe 2004 miniseries \"Identity Crisis\" retroactively reveals that Doctor Light had raped Sue Dibny, the wife of the superhero Elongated Man, on the JLA Satellite. Later issues reveal that he was a serial rapist. The Justice League resolve to alter his mind with Zatanna's magic so that Light will no longer pose a threat to their loved ones. In the process, they accidentally give him a partial lobotomy, thus explaining how he fell from a plausible foe of the Justice League to a punching bag for the Teen Titans or Little Boy Blue. He later recovers his memories and intellect when witnessing a fight between the League members responsible for his mind-wipe and Deathstroke, and vowed revenge against the Justice League.\n\nDoctor Light captures Green Arrow, using him as bait so he could get revenge on the Teen Titans. The entire Teen Titans roster, former and current, responds to the call, but he brutally defeats them. After a mass battle against the Titans wears him down, Cyborg uses a device to drain the light out of the area, rendering Light powerless. Batman and Batgirl appear to take him to prison, but reveal themselves to be Deathstroke and Ravager in disguise, and offer Light a place in the new Secret Society of Super Villains. Doctor Light, hungry for vengeance and power, readily accepts.\n\nAs a Society member, he aids Merlyn and Deathstroke in defeating Green Arrow in Star City. Doctor Light then attacks and absorbs a great deal of power from Kimiyo Hoshi. He later participates in the Battle of Metropolis in \"Infinite Crisis\" #7, where he is defeated by the combined efforts of the Ray, Black Canary, Martian Manhunter, and Kimiyo.\n\nIn the \"Justice League of America Wedding Special\", Light is a member of the Injustice League Unlimited. During a battle with the Justice League, fellow Injustice Leaguer Cheetah betrays him and slashes him in the back because of her hatred of rapists. The entire Injustice League is captured and deported to an alien world by the Suicide Squad; Doctor Light is consequently one of the villains featured in \"Salvation Run\".\n\nAfter returning to Earth, in \"DC Universe\" #0, Doctor Light is a member of Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains. In \"Final Crisis\" #1, he and Mirror Master are sent by Libra to recover Metron's chair. They are briefly challenged by Empress, Sparx, and Más y Menos, but defeat them by combining Light's beams with Mirror Master's mirrors. Light also aids the Human Flame and Libra in the murder of the Martian Manhunter.\n\nIn \"\" #1, the Spectre delivers final judgment on Doctor Light (who is discovered in the middle of a mock superhero rape orgy with various women dressed as Teen Titans), and burns him to death by turning him into a candle, using his head as the wick. The Milestone Comics group known as the Shadow Cabinet attempt to steal the remains of Light, still in the form of a candle. In actuality, Superman and Icon set this scenario up to familiarize the Shadow Cabinet with the JLA. The candle is, however, used by Hardware to restore to Kimiyo Hoshi the remaining powers Arthur stole from her.\n\nDoctor Light is entombed below the Hall of Justice. His corpse is revived as a Black Lantern. He devours the remains of Gehenna's corpse, and attacks Kimiyo Hoshi. Arthur employs psychology to make Kimiyo doubt herself. Just as he is on the verge of victory, he threatens Kimiyo's children, enraging her to the point where she produces a light which incinerates Arthur and his ring.\n\nIn The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Arthur Light is a scientist working with A.R.G.U.S. and the Justice League of America. As he is studying a communicator used by the Secret Society of Super Villains, he receives a \"nasty call\" and is engulfed in an explosion of light leaving his body glowing on the floor. Director Amanda Waller finds him transformed.\n\nDuring the \"Trinity War\" storyline, Doctor Light is a reluctant member of the new Justice League of America, and expresses disgust over being made to harm Ronnie Raymond and Jason Rusch. During his first mission with the team, he is seemingly killed by Superman. The Phantom Stranger takes Batman, Katana, and Deadman to the afterlife to locate Doctor Light. However, he doesn't remember anything about his death. The Phantom Stranger tells Doctor Light that he will try to free him from the afterlife, so he can be with his family. Doctor Light gives a piece of his soul to the Phantom Stranger in hopes that he can give it to his family as a final gift if he doesn't get out. It is later revealed that Atomica, who is from the alternate universe of Earth-3, is responsible for Doctor Light's death.\n\nDoctor Light's body unleashes energy that destroys Washington DC's A.R.G.U.S. headquarters and exposes the A.R.G.U.S. Agents to it. Etta Candy is approached by an energy manifestation of Dr. Light. Doctor Light appears in Los Angeles and is found by the Crimson Men. The Crimson Men take Dr. Light to their secret location, and promise to make him human again in exchange for information on Steve Trevor. Dr. Light heads to Steve Trevor's location and states he must kill him in order for him to live. Killer Frost faces off against Doctor Light. Doctor Light hurls her into Steve's ice-block, freeing him. While Killer Frost holds Light back, Steve sneaks up behind him and wraps the Lasso of Truth around him. Compelled by its power, Doctor Light explains that he died and woke up confused. He was told what to do and where Steve would be. The Crimson Men had told him the truth that Arthur Light is dead. Horrified by his own self-realization, Doctor Light disappears in a blast of light energy.\n\nDoctor Light later resurfaces, now sporting his classic appearance. He states that his human body is still dead, and that he now merely exists as a construct of living light energy. It is also implied that he used to be a villain prior to his brief stint as a member of the Justice League, indicating his backstory has been retconned to some degree. Having been cut off from his wife and daughters, Arthur has fled to the country of Chetland, where he is given asylum in exchange for his services. After a conversation with Deathstroke, Arthur contemplates the possibility of returning to a life of villainy.\n\nDoctor Light can control light for a variety of purposes. He can bend the light around him to become invisible, generate blasts of energy, create force fields, and fly. By mentally repulsing photons, Light can create areas of complete darkness. \"Teen Titans\" #23 implied that Light could \"power up\" by draining the ambient light in the area.\n\nThe limits of his powers are unclear, but he seems to be able to wrest control of anything that emits light. Such things have included Green Lantern constructs, Superboy's heat vision, and magic lightning from Wonder Girl's lasso. He is also able to take the \"internal\" light away from light powered characters, the heroic Doctor Light and the Ray, leaving them temporarily powerless. He also has the ability to create holographic images. Despite his frequent defeats, he is quite powerful.\n\nOriginally, Doctor Light derives his powers from his suit, but over time he internalizes this ability, and could use his powers without having to use his costume.\n\nArthur Light is mentally brilliant, a genius in the field of physics. However, his mindwipe by the Justice League reduces his intelligence substantially, along with his skills for creative use of his powers. Light's recovery of his memories seems to have brought his intellect back with them and also his paraphilia. As a result, he becomes a much deadlier opponent.\n\nA character named Doctor Light appears in \"All American\" #82 (February, 1947). This version is a enemy of Doctor Mid-Nite.\n\nDoctor Light is among the mind-controlled villains who attack the heroes as they assault Krona's Stronghold in issue #4. He is shown blasting Doorman.\n\nDoctor Light appears in \"Adventures in the DC Universe\" #1, \"Justice League Adventures\" #6, #13 and \"DC Comics Presents: Wonder Woman Adventures\" #1.\n\nDoctor Light appears in \"Tiny Titans\".

{"id": "5396197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5396197", "title": "Dominic Ongwen", "text": "Dominic Ongwen\n\nDominic Ongwen was born in 1975 in the village of Coorom, Kilak County, Amuru district, Northern Uganda. He is the ex-commander of the Sinia Brigade of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a guerrilla group that formerly operated in northern Uganda. As the head of one of the four LRA brigades, Ongwen was a member of the \"Control Altar\" of the LRA that directs military strategy. He is currently detained by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and has been awaiting trial. Proceedings commenced 6 December 2016.\n\nDominic Ongwen is almost certainly not his birth name. Like most other children of his age in Acoliland at the time, his parents would have trained him to give a false name if ever he was abducted, to protect the rest of the family.\n\nOngwen was abducted by the LRA as he walked to Koro Abili Primary School. According to his own testimony this happened in 1988 when he was fourteen. However, it has often been reported that he was nine or ten, and also that he was carried by other captives all the way up to the LRA’s main military bases because he was ‘too little to walk’.\n\nOnce abducted, he was tortured and forced to watch violent rituals of people being killed and subsequently indoctrinated, while still a child, as an LRA fighter. He then rose within the ranks and eventually became head of one of the four LRA brigades.\n\nOngwen was the lowest ranking of the five LRA leaders for whom the ICC issued their first ever warrants in June 2005. He is the only one who the court succeeded in detaining, and, with the exception of the leader, Joseph Kony, is the only one now left alive. He was initially charged with four counts of war crimes (murder, cruel treatment of civilians, intentionally directing an attack against a civilian population and pillaging) and three counts of crimes against humanity (murder, enslavement, and inhumane acts of inflicting serious bodily injury and suffering). The crimes were allegedly committed on or about 20 May 2004 at the Lukodi IDP Camp in the Gulu District, Uganda. The charges all relate to an attack on a camp for internally displaced people in Uganda in 2004.\n\nOn 21 December 2015, the ICC charged Dominic Ongwen with crimes in addition to those set out in the warrant of arrest: a total of seventy counts. The additional charges related to attacks on the Pajule IDP camp, the Odek IDP camp and the Abok IDP camp. The counts brought against the suspect in the context of these attacks include attacks against the civilian population, murder, attempted murder, torture, cruel treatment, other inhumane acts, enslavement, outrages upon personal dignity, pillaging, destruction of property, and persecution. The expanded charges against Dominic Ongwen also include sexual and gender-based crimes committed from 2002 to 2005 in Sinia Brigade – forced marriage, rape, torture, sexual slavery, and enslavement – and the conscription and use of children under the age of 15 to participate actively in hostilities from 2002 to 2005, in Sinia Brigade.\n\nThe charges are based on evidence which included witness statements or transcripts of interviews of a total of 123 witnesses, records of intercepted LRA radio communications, and oral testimonies of seven witnesses in September and November 2015.\n\nOngwen was reported killed in combat with a unit of the Uganda People's Defence Force on 10 October 2005, and the identity of the body was confirmed by former LRA commanders. However, in July 2006, the ICC reported that genetic fingerprinting of the body confirmed that it was not Ongwen's. News reports of the time put Ongwen in southwest Equatoria, Southern Sudan, attempting to rejoin LRA head Joseph Kony in Garamba, Ituri Province, northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ongwen and a former wife featured in a film \"Picking up the Pieces\" by IRIN and released in October 2007. Uganda People's Defence Force spokesperson Maj. Felix Kulayije commented, \"Unfortunately, the bastard is still alive.\"\n\nAt the end of 2014, Ongwen escaped detention by Joseph Kony for having disobeyed Kony's orders and having refused to answer Kony's radio messages. Having escaped the camp near Songo, in Kafia Kingi, Ongwen came across nomadic cattle herders who took him to a Seleka rebel group near Sam Ouandja in CAR. The former Seleka group commander reached out to a merchant in Mboki, who in turn called an NGO worker in Obo. The latter reached out to the American Special Forces in Obo, CAR. An American helicopter dispatched to Sam Ouandja picked up Ongwen and brought him to Obo. The Seleka were initially unaware of Ongwen's identity but learned about it after the case became public in the media. The Seleka commander told the RFI he hoped to receive the promised reward of $5m. However, the reward was never paid, and the Americans never publicly acknowledged the Seleka rebels' role in the capture. Ongwen was then transferred successively to the Ugandan forces, the Central African Republic forces, and ultimately to the ICC.\n\nDuring the time between his arrest and his transfer to the ICC Ongwen participated in several media activities including a radio broadcast, meetings with journalists and a video recording in which he claimed that he had given himself up because he was \"wasting his time in the bush\" as \"the LRA has no future\". He urged other insurgents to resume their civilian lives.\n\nOn 26 January 2015, Ongwen made his first appearance before the ICC, but the commencement of the confirmation of charges hearing was postponed in order to allow the Prosecutor to prepare adequately for the hearing and to comply with the Chamber's instructions.\n\nOn 6 February 2015, ICC severed the proceedings against Dominic Ongwen from the case of \"The Prosecutor v. Joseph Kony, Vincent Otti, Okot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen\". As the three other suspects in the case have not appeared or have not been apprehended yet, the Chamber deemed it necessary to separate the case so as not to delay the pre-trial proceedings against Mr Ongwen.\n\nOn 26 January 2016, Ongwen appeared before the ICC for a pre-trial hearing.\n\nOn 23 March 2016, the ICC confirmed the 70 charges brought against Dominic Ongwen and committed him to trial.\n\nThe trial began on 6 December 2016, but to hear only opening statements. Ongwen denied all the charges against him. The Prosecution began presenting its case in January 2017.\n\n2026 victims have been granted the right to participate in the proceedings.\n\nOngwen's case is unique because he himself was abducted by the LRA and forced to be a child soldier before rising to leadership. So this is the first ICC case in which an inductee is being charged with the same crimes as those done to him.\n\n\n"}

Hughes (April 2, 1915 – April 12, 1960) was an American nuclear physicist, chiefly notable as one of the signers of the Franck Report in June, 1945, recommending that the United States not use the atomic bomb as a weapon to prompt the surrender of Japan in World War II.\n\nBefore the war Hughes worked at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory. By June 1945, the U.S. was deciding whether to use an atomic bomb against Japan, and a very few nuclear scientists knew about the weapon's potential. Some, including Hughes, were wary, and wanted to urge the President of the United States to choose a different option. Arthur Compton appointed a committee to meet in secret, in all-night sessions in a highly secure environment. This committee included Hughes, and was chaired by James Franck. The final report, largely written by committee-member Eugene Rabinowitch, recommended that the nuclear bomb not be used, and proposed that either a demonstration of the \"new weapon\" be made before the eyes of representatives of all of the United Nations, on a barren island or desert, or to try to keep the existence of the nuclear bomb secret for as long as possible. The advice of the \"Franck Report\" was not followed, however, and the U.S. dropped nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nAfter the war Hughes went to Brookhaven National Laboratory and formed a group of physicists working on contemporary problems in nuclear science. His work centered on the neutron. Many of his publications were translated into Russian; more copies of his work were printed in the USSR than in the USA. He also spent one year at Oxford teaching.\n\nHe wrote a popular science book, \"The Neutron Story\", published 1959.\n\nHughes died suddenly in 1960.\n"}

Kenner (born Duncan Farrar Kenner; February 11, 1813 – July 3, 1887) was an American politician who served as a Deputy from Louisiana to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1862. In 1864, he served as the chief diplomat from the Confederate States of America to Europe.\n\nDouglas Farrar Kenner was born on February 11, 1813, in New Orleans. His ancestors were from Virginia. Kenner was married to the former Anne Guillelmine Nanine Bringier (August 24, 1822 – November 6, 1911). They resided at the Ashland Plantation. Kenner was the owner of sugar plantations in Louisiana. He used scientific techniques and was said to be the first man in Louisiana to use a railroad to bring sugar cane from the fields to the mill. He served as the President of the Louisiana Sugar Planters Association. He started his political career by working for John Slidell. He served for several terms in the Louisiana House of Representatives and was a member of the state constitutional conventions of 1845 and 1852, having presided over the latter conclave.\n\nDuring the American Civil War of 1861-1865, he was a member of the Confederate Congress and chairman of its Ways and Means Committee. In 1862, he proposed a national income tax of 20%, including a schedule of exemptions. His tax bill went nowhere; but in April 1863, the Confederate Congress passed another act calling for a tax \"in kind,\" payable with goods and agricultural produce rather than money, and based not on property but on agricultural produce and income it generated. In July 1862, while visiting with his family at Ashland Plantation during a recess of the legislature, Kenner narrowly avoided capture by the Union Army, making his escape after being warned by one of his slaves of the advance of Union troops. By this time he had become convinced that the emancipation of slaves was the only way to gain independence for the Confederacy. In 1864, he was sent by Jefferson Davis as special commissioner to England and France to secure the recognition of the Confederate States. Davis, through Kenner, offered the emancipation of the Confederate slaves in exchange for diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy by Britain and France. Following the capture of New Orleans in 1862, much of his property was confiscated and his slaves were freed.\n\nAfter the war, he regained his wealth. Kenner was fond of horses and owned one of the largest stock farms in the United States. In 1877 Kenner created the Louisiana Sugar Producer's Association, representing the largest planters in the state. He served as the president of the World Cotton Centennial. He also served on the Boards of Directors of several banks. Ten years later, a few months after his death, the Thibodaux Massacre was carried out by Democratic paramilitaries and concerned citizens in response to 10,000 sugar cane workers, 90% black, striking for three weeks, having been reverted almost to unpaid slave status. Kenner died on July 3, 1887. He was buried in a tomb in the Ascension of our Lord Catholic Church Cemetery in Donaldsonville, Ascension Parish, Louisiana.\n\n"}

After the conviction and sentencing, a long, armed standoff with federal law enforcement authorities at their New Hampshire residence ended with the arrest of Edward and Elaine Brown on October 4, 2007. In July 2009, while serving their sentences for the tax crimes, the Browns were found guilty by a federal district court jury of additional criminal charges arising from their conduct during the standoff.\n\nElaine Brown attended dental school at Tufts University in Boston before opening a dental practice in West Lebanon, New Hampshire. Elaine Brown earned most of the couple's income in dispute in the case in her dental practice.\n\nEd Brown is retired from the pest control business.\n\nIn 1960, Ed Brown was found guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon and armed robbery in connection with an attack on a man in Somerville, Massachusetts. Brown was imprisoned at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute in Concord, Massachusetts, was paroled in January 1965, and was pardoned in July 1976 by then-governor Michael Dukakis, with the recommendation of the Massachusetts Advisory Board of Parole.\n\nAccording to an October 1994 article in the \"New Hampshire Sunday News\", Ed Brown was the spokesman for an organization called the Constitution Defense Militia and had become involved in the militia movement in late 1993. The newspaper reported that Brown designated various individuals and organizations as being part of a conspiracy to deprive Americans of life and liberty. Among the people and organizations named by Brown were then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, former President George H.W. Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev, The Council on Foreign Relations, the United Nations, the Trilateral Commission, the American Bar Association, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nBrown reportedly had stockpiled 18 months' worth of food, with weapons and ammunition, and believed that there would be a Federal government takeover of \"private property, utilities, health facilities and the media.\" The 1994 article reported that Brown believed the militia was setting up its own \"courts… for the purpose of taking back America.\" The newspaper reported that Brown said he saw no way the conflict would end except in violence. The paper stated: \"Brown, who says he is an agnostic, admits it's easy to dismiss him as a nut.\"\n\nIn April 2006, Edward and Elaine Brown were indicted in the United States District Court in New Hampshire for numerous federal tax violations.\n\nProsecutors in the Browns' case presented evidence that the Browns had not paid income tax since 1996 and had not filed income tax returns since 1998; they were liable for taxes of more than $625,000.\n\nThe Browns initially chose to represent themselves, without the help of a court-appointed lawyer. Halfway through the trial Ed Brown decided not to return to the court, while Elaine Brown chose to enlist the help of a court-appointed lawyer to defend her and negotiate any possible plea bargain offered by the federal prosecutor.\n\nThe Browns claimed they had not been presented with any law that required them to pay income taxes to the federal government, an argument similar to many tax protester statutory arguments.\n\nOn January 18, 2007, Edward Brown was found guilty by a jury in a Federal District Court in Concord, New Hampshire of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States under , one count of conspiracy to structure financial transactions to evade the Treasury reporting requirements in violation of , and , and one count of structuring financial transactions to evade the Treasury reporting requirements and aiding and abetting under and . Elaine Brown was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States under , five counts of tax evasion and aiding and abetting under and , eight counts of willful failure to collect employment taxes under and aiding and abetting under , one count of conspiracy to structure financial transactions to evade the Treasury reporting requirements in violation of , and , and two counts of structuring financial transactions to evade the Treasury reporting requirements and aiding and abetting under and . The tax evasion convictions of Mrs. Brown involved the failure to report income of $1,310,706 over a period of five years. Each was sentenced to over five years in prison.\n\nBefore granting Elaine Brown's release on bail, the judge of the Browns' trial ordered her not to return to the Browns' home before sentencing. As a condition of her bail agreement with the state, she was ordered to live at her son's home in Worcester, Massachusetts, where she had been living prior to the trial. A tracking device was attached to her, and she was given permission to leave her son's home only if he was accompanying her; she later violated the terms of her release by destroying this device and rejoining her husband.\n\nOn April 14, 2007, the \"Concord Monitor\" reported that Ed and Elaine Brown \"recently ordered the clerk of the court to close their case, citing themselves as 'the court' and 'judge'.\" The Browns reportedly signed their filings with the court using new names: \"Edward, a Living Soul in the Body of the Lord, of the House of Israel,\" and \"Elaine, a Living Soul in the Body of the Lord, of the House of Israel.\" The court rejected the filings, ruling them frivolous.\n\nEd Brown said that he had a stock of food and supplies and that his home could run on wind and solar generators even if cut off from the main grid. He also stated publicly that he did not intend to go to jail and \"vowed to resist arrest violently and die rather than go to prison.\"\n\nDuring the standoff, a number of supporters were camped outside his home and were encouraged to record any attempt to take Brown from his house. This policy of opening the door to supporters led to the successful arrest of the couple by United States Deputy Marshals who disguised themselves as supporters.\n\nThe 100 acre property at 401 Center of Town Road, Plainfield, New Hampshire was scheduled to be auctioned off in Concord, New Hampshire, on August 15, 2014 by U.S. Marshals, although no one bid at the auction. The Browns implied in interviews that the woods around the house had explosive \"booby-traps. Federal officials therefore would not let interested bidders tour the property. In October 2015, however, would-be buyers were allowed to visit the property with an Internal Revenue Service official, and the property sold for $205,000 at auction on October 22, 2015.\n\nThe \"Concord Monitor\" wrote: \"The Browns changed their names in late March [2007] after converting to a non denominational form of Christianity they learned from a man named Sonny. According to friends of the Browns, Sonny, who wears a long beard, all-white attire and sandals, flew from Hawaii to New Hampshire to visit the Browns and shared his religious and legal teachings over several days.\" Elaine Brown was quoted as saying: \"The only law book we now recognize is the Bible. The only way we're coming out of our home is either as free man and free woman or in body bags.\"\n\nThe Browns alleged that they were not United States citizens, that they were non-residents of the United States for tax purposes, that the New Hampshire business tax laws were incorrect, null and void, and that labor could not be taxed. According to a New Hampshire newspaper, the Browns had not paid some state taxes, and \"face a state tax lien for business profit taxes\" of $343,000. The paper reported that with penalties and accumulated interest, the combined Federal and state tax amount owed by Edward and Elaine Brown was over three million dollars.\n\nIn mid-July 2007, Ed Brown also announced that he would stop paying school and town property taxes to the town of Plainfield, New Hampshire. A local newspaper quoted Brown as saying: \"They don't provide me any services, I'm not going to contribute to them anymore.\"\n\nThe \"Concord Monitor\" reported that property tax bills were mailed to residents of Plainfield on June 1, 2007, with return envelopes. The \"Monitor\" stated that when an employee of the town of Plainfield opened the return envelope from the Browns, no check for the Browns' property taxes was included. Instead, the Browns included a note with the following statement:\n\nNay! Nay! The land… at 401 Center of Town Road, Plainfield, New Hampshire [the Browns' residence], and all that is in and upon it, including the Lords bodies, are in the kingdom of heaven, belonging to the Lord, have been claimed by him, and thus can be claimed by no man, nor can any man have beneficial interest in it… Stand down and away from the Lords land and the bodies of the Lord. So it is written. So it is done.\n\nEdward Brown was also quoted as having made comments about law enforcement officials and the judge in his case:\n\nI wouldn't want to be this U.S. attorney. I wouldn't want to be this judge or these other people. This James John or anybody else that decides to come down here. Their names are already out there… They are just as vulnerable as I am. And if they're so foolish and stupid to think that they're not, hey, doom on them.\n\nEd Brown was reported to have stated in a radio interview in March 2007, in comments about federal authorities who were unwilling to see Brown's righteousness:\n\nOnce you've used the lawful word, you've done it the absolute proper way, and they still come at you, they are now attacking the Creator himself or itself,… You kill them. That is exactly what the Ten Commandments tell you to do.\n\nIn early June 2007 Brown claimed that the law enforcement officials surrounding his properties were part of a \"Zionist, Illuminati, Freemason movement,\" and that the federal government had no jurisdiction in New Hampshire. Referring to the warrants and court orders against him, Brown said \"This is just paper… This is fiction. The entire American government is fiction. We created it, didn't we?\" The \"New Hampshire Union Leader\" also reported that \"the Browns believe the IRS and the federal income tax are part of a deliberate plot perpetrated by Freemasons to control the American people and eventually the world.\"\n\nIn an interview on February 2, 2007, on the radio show \"Constitution for the Defense,\" Ed Brown was quoted as saying:\n\nThis is the beginning of one very huge movement. I'm not quite sure you understand the ramifications of what's going on right now. This is massive. This is international. We are fed up with the Zionist Illuminati. That's what this is all about. Loud and clear. Zionist Illuminati. Lawyers, whatever they are, okay, it's going to stop. And if the judge is a member of that, I know that McAuliffe [i.e., Steven J. McAuliffe, the Federal judge in Brown's tax case] is, I know that U.S. Attorney Colantuono is, they'd better stop. This is a warning. You can do whatever you want to me. My job is to get the message out, and I'm getting the message out, and I'm warning you guys - not you guys [referring to the radio show hosts], them - to cease and desist their unlawful activity in this country and every other country because once this thing starts, we're going to seek them out and hunt them down. And we're going to bring them to justice. So anybody wishes to join them, you go right ahead and join them. But I promise you, long after I'm gone, they're going to seek out every one of you and your bloodline.\n\nOn August 10, 2007, the \"New Hampshire Union Leader\" reported that Ed Brown said that a war was spreading and becoming an uprising against the federal government, eventually to develop into a revolution, and that the war would come within eighteen months. The \"Union Leader\" quoted Brown:\n\nAccording to the \"New Hampshire Union Leader\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn October 4, 2007, Ed and Elaine Brown were arrested without incident, ending the standoff. United States Marshal Stephen Monier stated: \"The Browns may now begin serving their 63-month federal prison terms… High profile situations like this are always difficult, but they don't have to be tragic. I'm glad no one was injured, and that the community remained safe throughout the operation.\"\n\nThe Browns were arrested by undercover officers, who were invited by the Browns into the Brown residence on the evening of Thursday, October 4, 2007. \"[B]efore the couple realized they weren't supporters, they were already under arrest.\" A local television station quoted U.S. Marshal Monier as saying: \"Ultimately, this open-door policy that they [the Browns] seemed to have which allowed the Browns to have some supporters bring them supplies, welcome followers and even host a picnic—this proved to be their undoing… They invited us in. We escorted them out.\"\n\nAfter the arrests, law enforcement personnel began searching the home and found weapons, ammunition, explosive devices and booby traps.\nLaw enforcement officials found twenty \"suspected pipe bombs,\" nine \"destructive devices,\" bags of high explosives hanging in the trees, smoke grenades, materials for partially constructed nail bombs, two .50-caliber rifles, 18 other guns, and over 60,000 rounds of ammunition.\n\nAt a news conference on October 5, 2007, U.S. Marshal Monier said that even more charges against the imprisoned Edward and Elaine Brown were likely: \"By their continuing actions, allegedly, to obstruct justice, to encourage others to assist them to obstruct justice, by making threats toward law enforcement and other governmental officials, they have turned this into more than a tax case.\"\n\nShortly after his imprisonment, Ed Brown claimed that he has been mistreated, tasered, gassed, subjected to sensory deprivation, and isolated from other inmates.\n\nBoth Edward and Elaine Brown and some of their followers were subsequently charged, tried, and found guilty of crimes in connection with the standoff.\n\nFour individuals who assisted Ed and Elaine Brown in the standoff were convicted in connection with the matter. Danny Riley of Cohoes, New York was sentenced to 36 years in federal prison, after having been convicted of helping to supply the Browns, and of stockpiling weapons and threatening law enforcement officials. Riley was convicted of conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and using guns and bombs in connection with the standoff. Also convicted in other trials were Jason Gerhard of Brookhaven, New York (sentenced to twenty years in prison), Cirino Gonzalez of Alice, Texas (sentenced to eight years in prison), and Robert Wolffe of Randolph, Vermont (who was sentenced to two and a half years).\n\nAs a result of the events during the standoff, Edward and Elaine Brown were indicted on January 21, 2009, by a federal grand jury in Concord, New Hampshire, and were charged with knowingly and willfully conspiring, by force, intimidation and threat, to prevent employees of the United States Marshals Service in the discharge of official duties in the arrest of the Browns, in violation of ; conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States in violation of and subsections (a) and (b) of ; carrying and possessing a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, in violation of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of ; being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of paragraph (1) of subsection (g) of ; obstruction of justice in violation of ; and failure to appear for sentencing, in violation of . Edward Brown was also charged with one count of failure to appear for trial in violation of . See Indictment, \"United States v. Edward Brown and Elaine Brown\".\n\nThe Browns filed numerous pre-trial motions, contending (among other things) that the United States is owned by Paine Webber and that \"the most powerful court in America is not the United States Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.\" According to the \"Concord Monitor\", the Browns filed \"about 30 motions, expressing views that their case is governed by commercial law, that they are not the people named in the indictment, that the federal government has no authority and that they can resolve all charges with 'promissory notes' for billions of dollars.\" The Browns also claimed: \"The U.S. has not had a Treasury since 1921\"; \"The United States does not have any employees because there is no longer a United States\"; \"There are no judicial courts in America and there has not been since 1789\"; \"There have not been any Judges in America since 1789\"; \"The Revolutionary War was a fraud\"; \"America is a British colony\"; \"Britain is owned by the Vatican\"; and \"A 1040 form [Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return] is for tribute paid to Britain\". Elaine Brown's court-appointed lawyer requested that her competency be evaluated. On June 2, 2009, the court ruled that Edward and Elaine Brown were competent to stand trial.\n\nOn July 9, 2009, Edward and Elaine Brown were found guilty by the federal district court jury of all counts charged.\n\nOn October 2, 2009 Elaine Brown was sentenced to 35 years in a Federal prison.\n\nIn January 2010, Edward Brown was sentenced to 37 years in prison.\n\nEdward and Elaine Brown appealed these convictions to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, but the convictions were upheld by the Court of Appeals on January 19, 2012. Elaine Brown filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court denied her petition on May 21, 2012.\n\nIn September 2011, Edward and Elaine Brown were identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as being members of the sovereign citizen movement.\n\nEdward Brown is scheduled for release on July 26, 2045, when he would be about 103 years old. Elaine Brown is scheduled for release in November 2042; she would also be about 102 years old if released at that time.\n\n\n"}

In Scotland, he is venerated as the patron saint of Clan Campbell.\n\nHe was known in Ireland as \"St Fintán\" or \"St Munnu\". In Scotland, he was recorded as \"St Mun\", \"St Munn\", \"St Munda\", \"St Mundas\" and \"St Mund\". The name Fionn was preceded by the term of endearment 'mo', followed by \"og\", meaning \"young\". Mo-Fhionn-Og became Munno, the name by which he is popularly known. \nBased on certain linguistic characteristics and some historical references, the earliest life of Fintán/Munna is believed to date around the year 800.\nFintán was born of the dynasty of Niall son of Tulchan (or Tulcan) and Feidelmia. According to the Felire of Oengus, Tulchan was a druid.\n\nFintán may have first studied at the school of Bangor Abbey under St. Comgall, and later in the school of Kilmore Deathrib. It is more certain that he studied 18 years under the abbot Sinell, son of Maynacur, at Cluain-inis in Lough Erne. St. Columba also studied at Cluain-inis under Sinell, but left prior to Munnu's arrival.\n\nFintán arrived in Scotland in 579 A.D. He was said to be assisted by two wolves in guarding his sheep.\n\nIn 597, Fintán resolved to go to I (now called Iona) to join the monastery there under St. Columba. Just before his departure, news reached him that St. Columba had died and that St. Baithen had succeeded him. Undeterred, Fintán made the journey and applied to St. Baithen for reception into the community. Munnu responded \"humbly\" as St. Baithen made the customary inquiries into his background. However, when Munnu requested to be admitted as a monk, Baithen replied:\n\n\" I thank my God, that you are come to this place; but this you must know: that you cannot be a monk of ours.\" Fintan much afflicted at these words said; \"Is it that I am unworthy of being one?\" \"No\" answered Baithen, \"but, although I should be very glad to keep you with me, I must obey the orders of my predecessor Columba, who some time ago said to me in the spirit of prophecy; Baithen remember these words of mine; immediately after my departure from this life, a brother, who is now regulating his youthful age by good conduct, and well versed in sacred studies, named Fintan, of the race of MocuMoie, (74) and son of Failchan, will come to you from Ireland (Scotia) and will supplicate to be reckoned among the monks. But it is predetermined by God, that he is to be an abbot presiding over monks, and a guide of souls. Do not therefore let him remain in these islands of ours, but direct him to return in peace to Ireland (Scotia), - that he may there establish a monastery in a part of Leinster not far from the sea, and labour for the good of souls.\"\nMun lived on the Island on Loch Leven, before making his way to Kilmun, where he founded a monastic community at the site of the modern Kilmun Church.\n\nFintán returned to Ireland shortly thereafter to found his monastery. A local lord in what is modern day Wexford in Leinster, named Dímma mac Áeda Croin, granted Fintán land circa 597. Munnu, in turn, granted, Dímma his personal guarantee that Dímma would gain the kingdom of heaven. Fintán at some point took Dímma's son into fosterage, and Dímma later became a cleric and was buried among the monks at the monastery. The monastery was named Teach-munnu or \"House of Munnu\" and became a center of learning. Fintán was versed in scientific knowledge and gave frequent public lectures where Christian revelation was illuminated by the sciences and mathematics. Munnu presided over 152 monks at Teach-munnu.\nMunnu probably founded a religious establishment at \"Kilmund\" (Kilmun). and may have done so at Eilean Munde as well. However, it is improbable that he is founder of Clonenagh, Fintan of Clonenagh, though they are often confused. He did have an abbey in Heli (or Hele, perhaps in County Westmeath), which he and his monks forsook, giving it to Saint Cera and her companions. Saint Cera named the place, according to Fintán's instructions, after St. Telle who had given three jubilations in the plain of Miodhluachra that day. There are several references to Munnu being a leper.\n\nToward the end of his life he opposed the adoption of the Roman method for determining the date of Easter. He strongly promoted the Irish method in opposition to Laserian. A synod convened at Magh Lene in 631 to resolve the matter, but the parties were unable to resolve the matter so a delegation was sent to Rome. Munnu withdrew his opposition, and adopted the Roman system with the rest of southern Ireland.\n\nIn his later years, he was a hermit, living on Lough Ree, Ireland.\n\nHe died on 21 October 635, and was buried in the cemetery at St Munn's Parish Church, Kilmun, Scotland.\n\nHis feast day is on 5 February and/or 21 October. Fintán is associated with several tales of miracles and is recorded to have been visited by an angel.\n"}

He was the first to be initiated into Filiki Eteria in Moscow by Nikolaos Skoufas in 1814.\n\nHe was the younger brother of Panagiotis and Athanasios Sekeris. He took his first steps in education at the well-known school of Dimitsana and later, in 1808, he followed his brother Panagiotis in Constantinople, where he continued his studies. Georgios didn’t wish to become a trader, but he wanted to study military science instead. In 1811, Panagiotis Sekeris sent him to apprentice at the centers of Greek intellectuals (Bucharest, Iași, Moscow, Vienna). In 1813 he went to Paris, where he became acquainted with Adamantios Korais. In 1814 Georgios traveled to Moscow, because he wanted to visit his brother Athanasios. While he was there, he met Athanasios Tsakalov, an acquaintance from Paris, who told him about the purpose of Filiki Eteria, a secret organization that he recently founded together with Nikolaos Skoufas and Emmanuil Xanthos. Georgios was the first member who was initiated into Filiki Eteria. On his way back to Paris he passed Vienna, where he met with Anthimos Gazis, a priest and scholar from Milies in Pelion, and initiated him into Filiki Eteria as well.\n\nWhen the Greek Revolution broke out he decided to rerun home. He set off from Marseille on the 18th of July 1821, on a brig charted by Alexandros Mavrokordatos, and arrived at Missolonghi on the 21st of July. From Messolonghi he went to the camp in Trikorfa, where Demetrios Ypsilantis was. Georgios followed Alexandros Mavrokordatos to Zarakova, where proestoi, the local notables, gathered in order to form the country's governing body. When he returned to Trikorfa, the Siege of Tripolitsa had begun. There, Georgios excelled due to his great abilities and bravery. He was appointed chieftain of Mantineian army but later his duties were restricted and he became an army leader of Tripolitsa province. He took part in the Siege of Old Patras, where he excelled in the battle on the 9th of March 1822, and in the Battles of Dervenakia, of Agios Sostis and of Agionori on the 26th-28 July 1822.\n\nWhen Dramalis’s army was defeated they fled to Corinth, but they were followed by Theodoros Kolokotronis, who led the siege of Corinth. Then, the people from Tripolitsa stayed in Dervenakia under the leadership of Georgios Sekeris. However, Georgios exhausted by the hardships of war fell ill and was taken to Tripoli, where he died on November 12, 1822.\n"}

He is the founder of the hair products company Black Like Me He is famous in South Africa for his life story: growing up and struggling against poverty and the Apartheid government to open his own hair business, which became the biggest hair brand in South Africa, making him a millionaire. He publicly backed Mmusi Maimane in the Democratic Alliance leadership race. He also wrote the book \"Black Like You\" which is his autobiography. Philosophically, he is a libertarian and \"capitalist crusader\" whose highest value is \"individual freedom.\"\n\nOn August 22, 2016, Mashaba was elected Mayor of Johannesburg by the first sitting of council following countrywide local government elections.\n\nMashaba was brought up in near-poverty in GaRamotse in Hammanskraal, Gauteng, by his sisters while his absent domestic-worker mother worked to provide for the family.\n\nHis older brother dropped out of school at 15, going from one unsubstantial job to another. Mashaba realised that an education would be crucial for him to break out of the cycle of poverty. He graduated from high school, but did not complete his tertiary education.\n\nFrom a young age he was a strategic thinker - he bought a car without having a license and drove out of the dealership without ever having learned to drive. He drove himself from one selling job to another, in the process confirming for himself that he was a natural salesman with an unswerving instinct for business. He started selling \"SuperKurl\" African hair-care products and became their number-one earner. He soon realised that these products excited him and that he wasn't content to be just an employee. (Reference: Book titled \"South Africa's Greatest Entrepreneurs\", compiled by Moky Makura, article written by Isabella Morris)\n\nHis company, \"Black Like Me\", was launched on Valentine’s Day in 1985 with a loan from his friend, businessman Walter Dube.\n\nMashaba is also a music lover. After five years of secret lessons, he revealed himself as a pianist.\n\nFrom 2012 until May 2014, Mashaba served as chairman of the Free Market Foundation (FMF). He stepped down from his position when he joined the Democratic Alliance as an \"ordinary card-carrying member\", citing the need for the Foundation to remain politically impartial.\n\nMashaba announced in December 2015 that he would accept a nomination to stand as a Democratic Alliance mayoral candidate for the City of Johannesburg in the 2016 local government elections. The other possible DA candidate was Rabelani Dagada.\n\nIn the municipal election on August 3, 2016, the ruling party, The African National Congress, lost their majority in Johannesburg, taking only 44.12% of the vote with the Democratic alliance taking 38.33%. The Democratic Alliance entered into conversations with the Economic Freedom Fighters to form a coalition. Whilst the EFF declined the offer, they agreed that they would vote for Mashaba as the Mayor for Johannesburg, despite misgivings.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, Mashaba was sworn in as a Johannesburg City Councillor. Later that day, he was sworn in as the Mayor of Johannesburg, the first non-ANC Johannesburg mayor since 1994.\n\nMashaba has characterised the ANC's post-Apartheid labour laws as \"draconian\".\n\nHe led a Constitutional Court challenge by the FMF, arguing that Section 32 of the Labour Relations Act is unconstitutional. The FMF argued that the bargaining council process reduces competition, as smaller businesses may not be able to afford the higher wages agreed on between larger businesses and unions, contributing further to South Africa's unemployment rate.\n\n"}

His father, Paul Schumann, was also a doctor. Schumann entered the Nazi party in 1930 and joined the Sturmabteilung in 1932. In 1933, he received his medical degree after producing a thesis entitled \"Frage der Jodresorption und der therapeutischen Wirkung sog. Jodbäder\" (\"The Question of Iodine Absorption and the Therapeutic Effects of so-called Iodine Baths\"). He started his career as an assistant doctor in the Surgical Clinic of the clinic of Halle University. \n\nFrom 1934, Schumann was employed in the Public Health Office in Halle. He was recruited to the air force as a physician in 1939. He joined the \"Aktion\" T4 Euthanasia program in early October 1939, after a meeting with Dr. Viktor Brack in Hitler's chancellery. In January 1940, Schumann became head of the Grafeneck euthanasia centre in Württemberg, where mentally ill people were gassed with carbon monoxide in the first gas chamber. In the early summer of 1940, he was ordered to the Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre. Schumann also belonged to a commission of doctors called \"Action 14f13\", who transferred weak and sick prisoners from Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Dachau, Flossenbürg, Gross-Rosen, Mauthausen, Neuengamme and Niederhangen concentration camps to the euthanasia killing centers. \n\nOn 28 July 1941, Schumann arrived in Auschwitz. He worked at Block 30 in the women's hospital, where he set up an x-ray station in 1942. Here men and women were forcibly sterilized by being positioned repeatedly for several minutes between two x-ray machines, the rays aiming at their sexual organs. Most subjects died after great suffering, or were gassed immediately because the radiation burns from which they suffered rendered them unfit for work. Men's testicles were removed and sent to Breslau for histopathological examination. Schumann \"...chose his test persons himself. They were always young, healthy, good-looking Jewish men, women and girls who looked like old people afterwards. The parts of the body that were treated with the rays were burnt, suppurating. Often the intestines were also affected. Many died. Part of Schumann's control tests, to check whether the radiation had worked, was the so-called semen check: a stick covered with a rubber hose was inserted into the rectum of the victim and the glands stimulated until ejaculation occurred so that the ejaculate could be tested for sperm...\" Both kinds of samples were sent to the University of Breslau (today Wrocław) for examination.\nSchumann selected some of the women in Block 10 in the main camp of Auschwitz. In this Block Jewish women had been imprisoned for human experiments. To control the radiation on women, prisoner doctors (Dr. Maximilian Samuel, Dr. Wladislaw Dering) had to remove an ovary.\n\nSchumann also performed typhus experiments by injecting people with blood from typhus patients and then attempting to cure the newly infected subjects. Schumann left Auschwitz in September 1944 and was appointed to the Sonnenstein Clinic in Saxony which had earlier been converted into a military hospital. \n\nWhile serving as a military doctor on the Western Front, he was captured by the Americans in January 1945. He was released from captivity in October 1945. In April 1946, he began to work as a sports doctor for the city of Gladbeck. An application for a license for a hunting gun led to his being identified in 1951 so the GDR issued an arrest warrant. According to his own statement, Schumann served as a ship’s doctor for three years and because he did not have a German passport, he applied for one in Japan in 1954 and received it under his own name. Schumann then fled, first to Egypt and eventually settled in Khartoum in the Sudan as head of a hospital. He was forced to flee from Sudan in 1962 after being recognized by an Auschwitz survivor. Then he went to Ghana, where he received the protection of the head of state, Kwame Nkrumah. \n\nIn 1966, he was extradited from Ghana to West Germany where the trial against him was opened in Frankfurt on 23 September 1970. However, Schumann was released from prison on 29 July 1972 due to his heart condition and generally deteriorating health. He did not die until 5 May 1983, 11 years after he had been released. As Robert Jay Lifton has observed \"...Schumann has great importance for us because of what he did – intense involvement in both direct medical killing and unusually brutal Auschwitz experiments – and what he was – an ordinary, but highly Nazified man and doctor...\" \n\n\n\n"}

During the Second World War, Roberts worked at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park from 1941-45. He was a leading codebreaker and linguist, who worked on the Lorenz cipher system — Hitler's most top-level code.\n\nJerry Roberts was born in Wembley, London. His father Herbert, had trained as a pharmacist, but worked for Lloyds Bank head office in the City for the rest of his 40-year career (since coming to London from Wales in 1915). His mother Leticia was a pianist and an organist who played in the local chapel. He was educated at Latymer Upper School, Hammersmith in London 1933-39 and University College London 1939-41. He gained a degree in German and French.\n\nEarly in the Second World War, his tutor at University College London, Prof. Leonard Willoughby, who had worked during the First World War in Room 40 the main cipher-breaking unit of that time, recommended the twenty-year-old Jerry Roberts as a German linguist to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he was interviewed and accepted by Colonel John Tiltman as a codebreaker and linguist.\n\nThe Testery, a special unit at Bletchley Park tasked with breaking the Lorenz cipher code named ‘Tunny’ by the British. This was the Nazis’ highest-level communications cipher system, which was used for communications between the Germany Army High Command in Berlin and their Army Commands in the field throughout occupied Europe, some of which were signed \"Adolf Hitler, Führer\". Captain Roberts was one of the four founding members, the other two senior cryptanalysts were Major Denis Oswald and Captain Peter Ericsson. The head of the unit Major Ralph Tester, was a linguist but not cryptanalyst.\n\nJerry Roberts worked in the Testery until the end of the war, by which time it had grown to nine cryptanalysts, a team of 24 ATS ladies, and a total staff of 118. Work was organised in three shifts working round the clock. Roberts was one of the three shift-leaders For the first year, the messages that were broken by hand amounted to 1.5 million pieces. The Newmanry, which became active in July 1943, developed and used machine methods to help speed up one stage — breaking of the chi-wheels but the psi-wheels and motor-wheels were still broken by hand in the Testery. From mid-1943 onwards, the Testery is credited with breaking over 90% of Lorenz traffic.\n\nLorenz cipher was Adolf Hitler’s most secret code system and had 12 wheels against well-known 3 wheel Enigma. Lorenz cipher was only declassified in 2002 compared with Enigma in the 1970s. Lorenz carried only the highest grade of intelligence; messages signed only by a handful of top generals and fieldmarshals, included Adolf Hitler himself. Used between Army HQ in Berlin and the generals and fieldmarshals in the field. Many were signed by Field Marshals: von Rundstedt, Rommel, Keitel, Jodl etc. – as well as a number of messages signed by the Führer himself.\n\nTens of thousands of Lorenz messages were intercepted by the British and broken at Bletchley Park by Captain Roberts and his fellow code-breakers in the Testery. These messages contained much vital insight into top-level German thinking and planning. Tunny provided vital information that changed the course of the war in Europe and saved tens of millions of lives at critical junctures — such as the Battle of Kursk in the Soviet Union, and D-Day. General Dwight Eisenhower (later the U.S President 1953-61) said after the war \"Bletchley decrypts shortened the war by at least 2 years\".\n\nAfter the war, Jerry Roberts was a member of the War Crimes Investigation Unit. Thereafter he pursued a new career in market research for 50 years, forming his own market research companies in the 1970s (one for the UK, one for the rest of Europe) until they were sold to GfK NOP (National Opinion Polls) in 1993 and continued working as a consultant to NOP assisting with multi-country studies until he was nearly eighty. He spoke fluent German, French and Spanish and used his skill in languages in his work.\n\n\nCaptain Roberts was the last survivor of the nine cryptanalysts who worked on Lorenz cipher. For the last six years of his life, he campaigned for proper recognition for Bletchley Park's 4Ts — for his colleagues in the Testery, and especially for its three \"Heroes\": Alan Turing who broke the naval Enigma, Bill Tutte who broke the Lorenz cipher system to help shorten the war, and Tommy Flowers who designed and built the Colossus, the world's first large-scale electronic, digital, programmable computer — to vastly speed up one stage (chi-wheel) of the breaking of Tunny traffic. However, the majority (the rest of 5 stages) of the work was performed by hand in the Testery by codebreakers and support staff.\n\nRoberts was honoured several times for his historic achievements. In July 2011, he was presented to Queen Elizabeth II in July 2011 at Bletchley Park. In October 2011, Roberts was featured in a BBC Timewatch Special titled \"Code-Breakers: Bletchley Park's Lost Heroes\", first broadcast on BBC Two on 25 October 2011. In 2013, he received an MBE New Years Honours List and awarded a UCL Honorary Fellowship. The same year, he was also honoured with an investiture stamp, which is available through Bletchley Park Post Office.\n\nWith characteristic modesty, he accepted all of these accolades as acknowledgment not of his own accomplishments, but of the work of his teammates at Bletchley Park, most of whom died unrecognised, before Tunny was declassified.\n\nCaptain Roberts' autobiography was published in March 2017, titled 'Lorenz: Breaking Hitler's top secret code at Bletchley-Park'.\n\n\nBy the end of the war, the Testery had grown to nine cryptographers and 24 ATS girls (as the women serving that role were then called), with a total staff of 118, organised in three shifts working round the clock.\n\n\nRoberts was interviewed by the BBC Tom Hepworth for the news on TV and radio on 11 April 2013, for his Investiture stamps issued by Bletchley.

Linnell was a naturalist and a rival to John Constable. He had a taste for Northern European art of the Renaissance, particularly Albrecht Dürer. He also associated with William Blake, to whom he introduced Samuel Palmer and others of the Ancients.\n\nLinnell was born in Bloomsbury, London. His father was a carver and gilder and Linnell was brought into contact with artists from an early age, and was drawing and selling portraits in chalk and pencil at the age of 10. His first artistic instruction was received from Benjamin West, and he spent a year in the house of John Varley the water-colour painter, where he had William Hunt and William Mulready as fellow-pupils, and made the acquaintance of Shelley, Godwin and other men of mark. In 1805 he was admitted a student of the Royal Academy, where he obtained medals for drawing, modelling and sculpture. He was trained as an engraver, and executed a transcript of Varley's \"Burial of Saul.\"\nIn later life he occupied himself with the burin, publishing, in 1833, a series of outlines from Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, and, in 1840, superintending the issue of a selection of plates from the pictures in Buckingham Palace, one of them, a Titian landscape, which he engraved in mezzotint. At first he supported himself mainly by miniature painting and execution of larger portraits, such as the likenesses of Mulready, Richard Whately, Peel and Thomas Carlyle. Several of his portraits he engraved in line and mezzotint.\n\nHe painted many subjects like the \"St John Preaching,\" the \"Covenant of Abraham,\" and the \"Journey to Emmaus,\" in which, while the landscape is usually prominent the figures are of sufficient importance to supply the title of the work. But it is mainly in connexion with paintings of pure landscapes that his name is known. His works commonly deal with some scene of typical uneventful English landscape, which is made impressive by a gorgeous effect of sunrise or sunset. They are full of true poetic feeling, and are rich and glowing in colour.\n\nLinnell commanded large prices for his pictures, and about 1850 he purchased a property at Redhill, Surrey, where he lived till his death on 20 January 1882, painting with unabated powers until within the last few years of his life. He devoted himself to painting landscapes notably of the North Downs and Kentish Weald. His leisure was occupied with a study of the Bible in the original, and he published several pamphlets and treatises of Biblical criticism. Linnell was one of the best friends and kindest patrons of William Blake. He gave him the two largest commissions he received for single series of designs—£150 for drawings and engravings of \"The Inventions to the Book of Job\", and a like sum for those illustrative of Dante Aligheri.\n\nHe was a friend of the painter Edward Thomas Daniell. A blue plaque commemorates Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead. The plaque mentions that William Blake stayed with Linnell as his guest.\nLinnell has over 150 oil paintings in public ownership in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kalangi Nathar was from Benaras.\nKalangi Nathar and Bogar were considered to possess an ideal master and student relationship. It is said that they had a mutual care among both of them in their own spiritual progresses. Kalangi Nathar, especially took more care and strain towards the spiritual advancement of his disciple bogar. Kalangi Nathar was behind Bogar's every development and his innovations for the world.\n\nHe is often referred to us Kanjamalai Siddhar. The word \"kanjam\" stands for the following meaning — gold, copper and Iron and malai means hill. It is said that Paranthaka Chozha who built Sri Nataraja temple with golden roof, took the gold from this hill. Also the water falls seen in this hill is called \"Ponni Nadhi\".\n\nHe is the disciple to the great siddha Thirumoolar. He is one among the seven disciples whom Thirumoolar transcended his knowledge, the other six being Indran, Soman, Rudhran, Kanduru, Brahman, and Kanjamalaiyan.\n\nThe shrine of Kalangi Nathar is found in a small village in Salem, Tamil Nadu. This village is 12 km away from Salem City. This place is in via route to Ilampillai.\n\nHe is supposed to have attained Samadhi in this place several hundred years ago.\n\nKalanginathar is Boghar's father according to Boghar's poem. Boghar glorifies Kalanginathar in many of his verses.\n\nKalanginathar is said to be the primary disciple of Thirumoolar Sithar, He went on to China by the use of a tablet, and attained mukthi (immortal status) in Kanchipupram. His jeeva samadhi is found in Kanchipuram district of Tamil Nadu. He has a very special temple in Sivadhapauram to Ellampillai, which is called as Sithar Koil in the same area. It is situated at the grounds of Kanjamalai. This temple is associated with a Kali temple in the left and Murugan in the upstairs respectively.\n\nThe following information is available about Sri Kamalamuni in the book \"Bogar 7000\" written by siddhar Bogar.\nSong 5729: Kamalamuni was born on the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May — June), his birth star being 2nd part of Poosam.\nSong 5725: The siddhar named Kamalamuni belongs to Kuravar caste. He lived for six-eight generations.\nSong 5841: Kamalamuni is 4000 years and some 300 odd (days) old. He lived in China for a long time.\n\nHowever, siddhar Karuvoorar in his book \"Vadha Kaviyam\" (Song 584) says that \"Maamuni\" belongs to \"Kannar\" caste. He does not explicitly say \"Kamalamuni\", but mentions \"Maamuni\". It is not known whether Karuvoorar refers to Kamalamuni or not.\n\nSri Kalangi Nadhar since mentioned as Bogar's father we can know that he comes from a caste called porkollar/vishwakarma/gold smith and this is mentioned by Bogar himself in his book Bogar 7000. Many people believe that Sri Kalangi Nathar is siddhar Kamalamuni. In the 63rd song of \"Kamalamuni Suthiram 76\", a line says that 'Kamalamuni alias Kalangi\". Hence it may be true that Sri Kalangi Nathar is siddhar Kamalamuni himself.\n\nIn \"Bogar Janana Sasthra\", it is mentioned that Kamalamuni attained samadhi at Madurai. It is believed that siddhar Kamalamuni attained samadhi at Thiruvavur.\n\nKalangi Nathar was an Indian ascetic who had gone to China. Kalangi Nathar belongs to both Nath tradition of Northern India and also the Siddha tradition of Southern India. Kalangi Nathar is associated with Kaanja Malai in South India and later migrated and lived in China and spread the knowledge of yoga and Varma-Kalai (acupuncture) to the Chinese people. In China he is called Confucius. Kalangi Nathar decided to go into Samadhi for a very long time (for about 5000-years), and called Bogar to come to China to continue his mission. According to Chinese tradition, Laozi lived in the 6th century BC, however many historians contend that Laozi actually lived in the 4th century BC, which was the period of Hundred Schools of Thought and Warring States Period, whereas Confucius was born in 551 BCE in Lu, a small state in China and died in 479 BCE (as per Chinese sources). This shows that Confucius was elder to Laozi. Bhoganathar who is called Laozi/Lao Tzu in China, was the successor of Kalangi Nathar (Confucius).\n\n"}
{"id": "16899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16899", "title": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar", "text": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr.; April 16, 1947) is an American retired professional basketball player who played 20 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers. During his career as a center, Abdul-Jabbar was a record six-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), a record 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA selection, and an 11-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. A member of six NBA championship teams as a player and two more as an assistant coach, Abdul-Jabbar twice was voted NBA Finals MVP. In 1996, he was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. NBA coach Pat Riley and players Isiah Thomas and Julius Erving have called him the greatest basketball player of all time.\n\nAfter winning 71 consecutive basketball games on his high school team in New York City, Alcindor was recruited by Jerry Norman, the assistant coach of UCLA, where he played for coach John Wooden on three consecutive national championship teams and was a record three-time MVP of the NCAA Tournament. Drafted with the first overall pick by the one-season-old Bucks franchise in the 1969 NBA draft, Alcindor spent six seasons in Milwaukee. After leading the Bucks to its first NBA championship at age 24 in 1971, he took the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark \"skyhook\" shot, he established himself as one of the league's top scorers. In 1975, he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played the last 14 seasons of his career and won five additional NBA championships. Abdul-Jabbar's contributions were a key component in the \"Showtime\" era of Lakers basketball. Over his 20-year NBA career, his team succeeded in making the playoffs 18 times and past the first round in 14 of them; his team reached the NBA Finals 10 times.\n\nAt the time of his retirement in 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was the NBA's all-time leader in points scored (38,387), games played (1,560), minutes played (57,446), field goals made (15,837), field goal attempts (28,307), blocked shots (3,189), defensive rebounds (9,394), career wins (1,074), and personal fouls (4,657). He remains the all-time leader in points scored and career wins. He is ranked third all-time in both rebounds and blocked shots. In 2007, ESPN voted him the greatest center of all time, in 2008, they named him the \"greatest player in college basketball history\", and in 2016, they named him the second best player in NBA history (behind Michael Jordan). Abdul-Jabbar has also been an actor, a basketball coach, and a best-selling author. In 2012, he was selected by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to be a U.S. global cultural ambassador. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nFerdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. was born in New York City, the only child of Cora Lillian, a department store price checker, and Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Sr., a transit police officer and jazz musician. He was unusually large and tall from a young age. At birth he weighed and was long, and by age 9 he was already tall. By the eighth grade (age 13–14) he had grown to tall and could already slam dunk a basketball on a regulation hoop. He would eventually reach his full height of when he entered the NBA at age 22.\n\nAlcindor began his record-breaking basketball accomplishments from an early age. In high school, he led coach Jack Donahue's Power Memorial Academy team to three straight New York City Catholic championships, a 71-game winning streak, and a 79–2 overall record. This earned him a nickname—\"The tower from Power\". His 2,067 total points were a New York City high school record. The team won the national high school boys basketball championship when Alcindor was in 11th grade and was runner-up his senior year. Alcindor had a strained relationship with his coach. In his 2017 book \"Coach Wooden and Me,\" Abdul-Jabbar relates an incident where Donahue called him a nigger.\n\nAlcindor played on the UCLA freshman team in 1966 only because the \"freshman rule\" was in effect, but his prowess was already well known. From 1967 to 1969, he played on the varsity under head coach John Wooden. He was the main contributor to the team's three-year record of 88 wins and only two losses: one to the University of Houston in which Alcindor had an eye injury, and the other to crosstown rival USC who played a \"stall game\" (i.e., there was no shot clock in those days, so a team could hold the ball as long as it wanted before attempting to score). In his first game, Alcindor scored 56 points, which set a UCLA single-game record.\nDuring his college career, Alcindor was twice named Player of the Year (1967, 1969); was a three-time First Team All-American (1967–1969); played on three NCAA basketball champion teams (1967, 1968 and 1969); was honored as the Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA Tournament (1967, 1968, 1969); and became the first-ever Naismith College Player of the Year in 1969.\n\nIn 1967 and 1968, he also won USBWA College Player of the Year, which later became the Oscar Robertson Trophy. Alcindor became the only player to win the Helms Foundation Player of the Year award three times. The 1965–66 UCLA Bruin team was the preseason #1. On November 27, 1965, the freshman team, led by Alcindor, defeated the varsity 75–60 in the first game in the new Pauley Pavilion. Alcindor scored 31 points and had 21 rebounds in what was a good indication of things to come. After the game, the UCLA varsity was #1 in the country but #2 on campus. If the \"freshman rule\" had not been in effect at that time, UCLA would have had a much better chance of winning the 1966 National Championship.\n\nAlcindor had considered transferring to Michigan because of unfulfilled recruiting promises. UCLA player Willie Naulls introduced Alcindor and teammate Lucius Allen to athletic booster Sam Gilbert, who convinced the pair to remain at UCLA.\n\nThe dunk was banned in college basketball after the 1967 season, primarily because of Alcindor's dominant use of the shot. The rule was not rescinded until the 1976–77 season, which was shortly after Wooden's retirement.\n\nDuring his junior year, Alcindor suffered a scratched left cornea on January 12, 1968, in a game against Cal when he was struck by Tom Henderson in a rebound battle. He would miss the next two games against Stanford and Portland. This happened right before the showdown game against Houston. His cornea would again be scratched during his pro career, which subsequently caused him to wear goggles for eye protection.\n\nDuring the summer of 1968, Alcindor took the \"shahada\" twice and converted to Sunni Islam, though he did not begin publicly using his Arabic name until 1971. He boycotted the 1968 Summer Olympics by deciding not to try out for the United States Men's Olympic Basketball team. This action was in protest to the unequal treatment of African-Americans in the United States.\n\nHe was one of only four players who started on three NCAA championship teams; the others all played for Wooden at UCLA: Henry Bibby, Curtis Rowe and Lynn Shackelford. In sharp contrast to what goes on today, Alcindor did not declare early for the NBA draft. He completed his studies and earned a Bachelor of Arts with a major in history in 1969. In his free time, he practiced martial arts. He studied Jeet Kune Do under Bruce Lee.\n\nOn January 20, 1968, Alcindor and the UCLA Bruins faced coach Guy Lewis's Houston Cougars in the first-ever nationally televised regular-season college basketball game, with 52,693 in attendance at the Astrodome. Cougar forward Elvin Hayes scored 39 points and had 15 rebounds, while Alcindor, who suffered from a scratch on his left cornea, was held to just 15 points as Houston won 71–69. The Bruins' 47-game winning streak ended in what has been called the \"Game of the Century\". Hayes and Alcindor had a rematch in the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament where UCLA, with a healthy Alcindor, defeated Houston 101–69 in the semi-finals en route to the national championship. UCLA limited Hayes, who was averaging 37.7 points per game, to only ten points. Wooden credited his assistant, Jerry Norman, for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained Hayes.\n\nAs of the 2011–12 season, he still holds or shares a number of individual records at UCLA:\n\nThe Harlem Globetrotters offered Alcindor $1 million to play for them, but he declined and was picked first in the 1969 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, who were in only their second season of existence. The Bucks won a coin-toss with the Phoenix Suns for first pick. He was also chosen first overall in the 1969 American Basketball Association draft by the New York Nets. The Nets believed that they had the upper hand in securing Alcindor's services because he was from New York; however, when Alcindor told both the Bucks and the Nets that he would accept one offer only from each team, the Nets bid too low. Sam Gilbert negotiated the contract along with Los Angeles businessman Ralph Shapiro at no charge. After Alcindor chose the Milwaukee Bucks' offer of $1.4 million, the Nets offered a guaranteed $3.25 million. Alcindor declined the offer, saying, \"A bidding war degrades the people involved. It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I don't want to think like that.\"\n\nAlcindor's presence enabled the 1969–70 Bucks to claim second place in the NBA's Eastern Division with a 56–26 record (improved from 27–55 the previous year). Alcindor was an instant star, ranking second in the league in scoring (28.8 ppg) and third in rebounding (14.5 rpg), for which he was awarded the title of NBA Rookie of the Year. Until Jayson Tatum in 2018, Alcindor would be the only rookie to record 10 or more games of 20+ points scored during the playoffs.\n\nThe next season, the Bucks acquired All-Star guard Oscar Robertson. Milwaukee went on to record the best record in the league with 66 victories in the 1970–71 season, including a then-record 20 straight wins. Alcindor was awarded his first of six NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, along with his first scoring title (31.7 ppg). He also led the league in total points, with 2,596. In the playoffs, the Bucks went 12–2 (including a four-game sweep of the Baltimore Bullets in the NBA Finals), and won the championship, while Alcindor was named Finals MVP. On May 1, 1971, the day after the Bucks won the NBA championship, he adopted the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (, \"Karīm Abd al-Jabbār\"), its translation roughly \"generous/noble (Kareem), servant of (Abdul) the mighty/stern one (Jabbar) [i.e., of God]\". He had converted to Islam while at UCLA.\nAbdul-Jabbar remained a dominant force for the Bucks. The following year, he repeated as scoring champion with (34.8 ppg and 2,822 total points) and was named NBA Most Valuable Player. He helped the Bucks to repeat as division leaders for four straight years. In 1974, Abdul-Jabbar won his third MVP Award in five years and was among the top five NBA players in scoring (27.0 ppg, third), rebounding (14.5 rpg, fourth), blocked shots (283, second), and field goal percentage (.539, second).\n\nAbdul-Jabbar remained relatively injury-free throughout his NBA career, but he twice broke one of his hands. The first incident occurred during a pre-season game in 1974, when he was bumped hard and got his eye scratched; this angered him enough to punch the basket support . He returned after missing the first 16 games of the season and started to wear protective goggles. In the second incident, he broke his hand during the opening game of the 1977–78 season. Two minutes into the game, Abdul-Jabbar punched Milwaukee's Kent Benson in retaliation for an overly aggressive elbow; the punch caused Benson's jaw to be broken. As a result of the injury to his hand, Abdul-Jabbar was out for two months, and it was unnecessary for the NBA to suspend him.\n\nAlthough Abdul-Jabbar always spoke well of Milwaukee and its fans, he said that being in the Midwest did not fit his cultural needs. In October 1974, he requested a trade to either the New York Knicks or Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1975, the Lakers acquired Abdul-Jabbar and reserve center Walt Wesley from the Bucks for center Elmore Smith, guard Brian Winters, and rookie \"blue chippers\" Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman. In the 1975–76 season, his first with the Lakers, he had a dominating season, averaging 27.7 points per game and leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played. His 1,111 defensive rebounds remains the NBA single-season record (defensive rebounds were not recorded prior to the 1973–74 season). He earned his fourth MVP award, but missed the post-season for the second straight year.\nOnce he joined the Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar began wearing his trademark goggles (he briefly ditched them in the 1979–80 season). Years of battling under NBA backboards, and being hit and scratched in the face in the process, had taken their toll on his eyes and he developed corneal erosion syndrome, where the eyes begin to dry out easily and cease to produce moisture. He missed one game in the 1986–87 season when his eyes dried out and swelled.\n\nIn the 1976–77 season, Abdul-Jabbar had another strong performance. He led the league in field goal percentage, finished second in rebounds and blocked shots, and third in points per game. He helped lead the Lakers to the best record in the NBA, and he won his record-tying fifth MVP award. In the playoffs, the Lakers beat the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference semi-finals, setting up a confrontation with the Portland Trail Blazers. The result was a memorable matchup, pitting Abdul-Jabbar against a young, injury-free Bill Walton. Although Abdul-Jabbar dominated the series statistically, Walton and the Trail Blazers (who were experiencing their first-ever run in the playoffs) swept the Lakers, behind Walton's skillful passing and leadership.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar's play remained strong during the next two seasons, being named to the All-NBA Second Team twice, the All-Defense First Team once, and the All-Defense Second Team once. The Lakers, however, continued to be stymied in the playoffs, being eliminated by the Seattle SuperSonics in both 1978 and 1979.\n\nIn 1979, the Lakers acquired first overall draft pick Magic Johnson. The trade and draft paved the way for a Laker dynasty as they went on to become one of the most dominant teams of the 1980s, appearing in the finals eight times and winning five NBA championships. Individually, while Abdul-Jabbar was not the dominant center he had been in the 1970s, he experienced a number of highlight moments. Among them were his record sixth MVP award in 1980, four more All-NBA First Team designations, two more All-Defense First Team designations, the 1985 Finals MVP, and on April 5, 1984 breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record for most career points. Later in his career, he bulked up to about , to be able to withstand the strain of playing the highly physical center position into his early 40s.\n\nWhile in Los Angeles, Abdul-Jabbar started doing yoga in 1976 to improve his flexibility, and was notable for his physical fitness regimen. He says, \"There is no way I could have played as long as I did without yoga.\"\n\nIn 1983, Abdul-Jabbar's house burned down. Many of his belongings, including his beloved jazz LP collection of about 3,000 albums, were destroyed. Many Lakers fans sent and brought him albums, which he found uplifting.\n\nOn June 28, 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was 42 years old when announced that he would retire at the end of the season after twenty years in the NBA. On his \"retirement tour\" he received standing ovations at games, home and away and gifts ranging from a yacht that said \"Captain Skyhook\" to framed jerseys from his basketball career to an Afghan rug. In his biography \"My Life\", Magic Johnson recalls that many Lakers and Celtics legends participated in Abdul-Jabbar's farewell game. Every player wore Abdul-Jabbar's trademark goggles and had to try a skyhook at least once, which led to comic results. The Lakers made the NBA Finals in each of Abdul-Jabbar's final three seasons, defeating Boston in 1987, and Detroit in 1988. The Lakers lost to the Pistons in a four-game sweep in his final season.\n\nAt the time of his retirement, Abdul-Jabbar held the record for most games played by a single player in the NBA; this would later be broken by Robert Parish. He also was the all-time record holder for most points (38,387), most field goals made (15,837), and most minutes played (57,446).\n\nSince 2005, Abdul-Jabbar has served as a special assistant coach for the Lakers. He had been interested in coaching since his retirement, and given the influence that he exerted on the league during his playing days, he thought that the opportunity would present itself. However, during his playing years, Abdul-Jabbar had developed a reputation for being introverted and sullen. He did not speak to the press, which led to the impression that he disliked journalists. In his biography \"My Life\", Magic Johnson recalls instances when Abdul-Jabbar brushed him off when he was a ball boy and asked him for an autograph. Abdul-Jabbar also froze out reporters who gave him a too-enthusiastic handshake or even hugged him, and he refused to stop reading the newspaper while giving an interview.\n\nMany basketball observers, in addition to Abdul-Jabbar himself, believe that his reticence, whether through disdain for the press or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA. In his words, he said he had a mindset he could not overcome, and proceeded through his career oblivious to the effect his reticence may have had on his future coaching prospects. Abdul-Jabbar said: \"I didn't understand that I also had affected people that way and that's what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I paid a price for it.\" Since he began lobbying for a coaching position in 1995, he has managed to obtain only low-level assistant and scouting jobs in the NBA, and a head coaching position only in a minor professional league.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar has worked as an assistant for the Los Angeles Clippers and the Seattle SuperSonics, helping mentor, among others, their young centers, Michael Olowokandi and Jerome James. Abdul-Jabbar was the head coach of the Oklahoma Storm of the United States Basketball League in 2002, leading the team to the league's championship that season, but he failed to land the head coaching position at Columbia University a year later. He then worked as a scout for the New York Knicks. Finally, on September 2, 2005, he returned to the Lakers as a special assistant to Phil Jackson to help the Lakers' centers, and in particular their young draftee Andrew Bynum. Abdul-Jabbar's influence has been credited with Bynum's emergence as a more talented NBA center. Abdul-Jabbar also served as a volunteer coach at Alchesay High School on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in Whiteriver, Arizona in 1998.\n\nIn 2016, he performed a tribute to friend Muhammad Ali along with Chance the Rapper. He is also co-author of a comic book published by Titan Comics entitled \"Mycroft Holmes and the Apocalypse Handbook\".\n\nOn offense, Abdul-Jabbar was an unstoppable low-post threat. In contrast to other low-post dominators like Wilt Chamberlain, Artis Gilmore or Shaquille O'Neal, Abdul-Jabbar was a relatively slender player, standing tall but only weighing (though in his latter years the Lakers listed Abdul-Jabbar's weight as ). However, he made up for his relative lack of bulk by showing textbook finesse, strength and was famous for his ambidextrous skyhook shot, which was impossible for defenders to block. It contributed to his high .559 field goal accuracy, making him the eighth most accurate scorer of all time and a feared clutch shooter. Abdul-Jabbar was also quick enough to run the Showtime fast break led by Magic Johnson and was well-conditioned, standing on the hardwood an average 36.8 minutes. In contrast to other big men, Abdul-Jabbar also could reasonably hit his free throws, finishing with a career 72% average.\nAbdul-Jabbar maintained a dominant presence on defense. He was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Team eleven times. He frustrated opponents with his superior shot-blocking ability and denied an average of 2.6 shots a game. After the pounding he endured early in his career, his rebounding average fell to between six or eight a game in his latter years.\n\nAs a teammate, Abdul-Jabbar exuded natural leadership and was affectionately called \"Cap\" or \"Captain\" by his colleagues. He had an even temperament, which Riley said made him coachable. A strict fitness regime made him one of the most durable players of all time. In the NBA, his 20 seasons and 1,560 games are performances surpassed only by former Celtics' center Robert Parish.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar was well known for his trademark \"skyhook\", a hook shot in which he bent his entire body (rather than just the arm) like a straw in one fluid motion to raise the ball and then release it at the highest point of his arm's arching motion. Combined with his long arms and great height——the skyhook was difficult for a defender to block without committing a goaltending violation. It was a reliable and feared offensive weapon and contributed to his high lifetime field goal percentage of 0.559. He was adept at shooting the skyhook with either hand, which made him even more difficult to defend against, though as a right-handed player, he was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left. According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the Mikan Drill and soon learned to value it, as it was \"the only shot I could use that didn't get smashed back in my face\".\n\nAbdul-Jabbar is the NBA's all-time leading scorer with 38,387 points and won a league-record six MVP awards. He earned six championship rings, two Finals MVP awards, fifteen NBA First or Second Teams, a record nineteen NBA All-Star call-ups and averaging 24.6 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 2.6 blocks per game. He is ranked as the NBA's third leading all-time rebounder (17,440). He is also the third all-time in registered blocks (3,189), which is even more impressive because this stat had not been recorded until the fourth year of his career (1974).\n\nAbdul-Jabbar combined dominance during his career peak with the longevity and sustained excellence of his later years. After claiming his sixth and final MVP in 1980, he continued to average above 20 points in the following six seasons, including 23 points per game in his 17th season at age 38. He made the NBA's 35th Anniversary Team, and was named one of its 50 greatest players of all time in 1996. Abdul-Jabbar is regarded as one of the best centers ever, and league experts and basketball legends frequently mentioned him when considering the greatest player of all time. Former Lakers coach Pat Riley once said, \"Why judge anymore? When a man has broken records, won championships, endured tremendous criticism and responsibility, why judge? Let's toast him as the greatest player ever.\" Isiah Thomas remarked, \"If they say the numbers don't lie, then Kareem is the greatest ever to play the game.\" Julius Erving in 2013 said, \"In terms of players all-time, Kareem is still the number one guy. He's the guy you gotta start your franchise with.\" In 2015, ESPN named Abdul-Jabbar the best center in NBA history, and ranked him No. 2 behind Michael Jordan among the greatest NBA players ever. While Jordan's shots were enthralling and considered unfathomable, Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook appeared automatic, and he himself called the shot \"unsexy\".\n\n\nPlaying in Los Angeles facilitated Abdul-Jabbar's trying his hand at acting.\nHe made his film debut in Bruce Lee's 1972 film \"Game of Death\", in which his character Hakim fights Billy Lo (played by Lee).\n\nIn 1980, he played co-pilot Roger Murdock in \"Airplane!\". Abdul-Jabbar has a scene in which a little boy looks at him and remarks that he is in fact Abdul-Jabbar—spoofing the appearance of football star Elroy \"Crazylegs\" Hirsch as an airplane pilot in the 1957 drama that served as the inspiration for \"Airplane!\", \"Zero Hour!\". Staying in character, Abdul-Jabbar states that he is merely Roger Murdock, an airline co-pilot, but the boy continues to insist that Abdul-Jabbar is \"the greatest\", but that, according to his father, he doesn't \"work hard on defense\" and \"never really tries, except during the playoffs\". This causes Abdul-Jabbar's character to snap, \"The hell I don't!\", then grab the boy and snarl he has \"[heard] that crap ever since ... UCLA\", he \"busts his buns every night\" and the boy should tell his \"old man to drag [Bill] Walton and [Bob] Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes\". When Murdock loses consciousness later in the film, he collapses at the controls wearing Abdul-Jabbar's goggles and yellow Lakers' shorts.\nAbdul-Jabbar has had numerous other television and film appearances, often playing himself. He has had roles in movies such as \"Fletch\", \"Troop Beverly Hills\" and \"Forget Paris\", and television series such as \"Full House\", \"Living Single\", \"Amen\", \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", \"Martin\", \"Diff'rent Strokes\" (his height humorously contrasted with that of diminutive child star Gary Coleman), \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", \"Scrubs\", \"21 Jump Street\", \"Emergency!\", \"Man from Atlantis\", and \"New Girl\". Abdul-Jabbar played a genie in a lamp in a 1984 episode of \"Tales from the Darkside\". He also played himself on the February 10, 1994 episode of the sketch comedy television series \"In Living Color\".\n\nHe also appeared in the television version of Stephen King's \"The Stand\", played the Archangel of Basketball in \"Slam Dunk Ernest\", and had a brief non-speaking cameo appearance in \"BASEketball\". Abdul-Jabbar was also the co-executive producer of the 1994 TV film \"Road to Freedom: The Vernon Johns Story\". He has also made appearances on \"The Colbert Report\", in a 2006 skit called \"HipHopKetball II: The ReJazzebration Remix '06\" and in 2008 as a stage manager who is sent out on a mission to find Nazi gold. Abdul-Jabbar also voiced himself in a 2011 episode of \"The Simpsons\" titled \"Love Is a Many Strangled Thing\". He had a recurring role as himself on the NBC series \"Guys with Kids\", which aired from 2012 to 2013. On Al Jazeera English he expressed his desire to be remembered not just as a player, but somebody who had many talents and used them.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar was selected to appear in the 2013 ABC reality series \"Splash\", a celebrity diving competition.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar has also created the 2011 documentary \"On the Shoulders of Giants\", based on the all-black basketball team New York Renaissance.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar has also appeared with Robert Hays (Ted Striker) in a 2014 \"Airplane!\" parody commercial promoting Wisconsin tourism. In 2015, he appeared in an HBO documentary on his life, \"Kareem: Minority of One\".\n\nIn April 2018, Abdul-Jabbar was announced as one of the celebrities who competed on season 26 of \"Dancing with the Stars\". He was partnered with professional dancer Lindsay Arnold.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar is also a best-selling author and cultural critic. His first book, his autobiography \"Giant Steps\", was written in 1983 with co-author Peter Knobler. (The book's title is an homage to jazz great John Coltrane, referring to his album \"Giant Steps\".) Others include \"On the Shoulders of Giants: My Journey Through the Harlem Renaissance\", co-written with Raymond Obstfeld, and \"Brothers in Arms: The Epic Story of the 761st Tank Battalion, World War II's Forgotten Heroes\", co-written with Anthony Walton, which is a history of an all-black armored unit that served with distinction in Europe.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar has also been a regular contributor to discussions about issues of race and religion, among other topics, in national magazines and on television. He has written a regular column for \"Time\", for example, and he appeared on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, January 25, 2015, to talk about a recent column, which pointed out that Islam should not be blamed for the actions of violent extremists, just as Christianity has not been blamed for the actions of violent extremists who profess Christianity. When asked about being Muslim, he said: \"I don't have any misgiving about my faith. I'm very concerned about the people who claim to be Muslims that are murdering people and creating all this mayhem in the world. That is not what Islam is about, and that should not be what people think of when they think about Muslims. But it's up to all of us to do something about all of it.\"\n\nIn November 2014, Abdul-Jabbar published an essay in \"Jacobin\" magazine calling for just compensation for college athletes, writing, \"in the name of fairness, we must bring an end to the indentured servitude of college athletes and start paying them what they are worth.\"\n\nIn 2007, Abdul-Jabbar participated in the national UCLA alumni commercial entitled \"My Big UCLA Moment\". The UCLA commercial is featured on YouTube.\n\nOn February 10, 2011, Abdul-Jabbar debuted his film \"On the Shoulders of Giants\", documenting the tumultuous journey of the famed yet often-overlooked Harlem Renaissance professional basketball team, at Science Park High School in Newark, New Jersey. The event was simulcasted live throughout the school, city, and state. Commentating on Donald Trump's 2017 travel ban, he strongly condemned it, saying: \"the absence of reason and compassion is the very definition of pure evil because it is a rejection of our sacred values, distilled from millennia of struggle.\"\n\nIn January 2012, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that Abdul-Jabbar had accepted a position as a cultural ambassador for the United States. During the announcement press conference, Abdul-Jabbar commented on the historical legacy of African-Americans as representatives of U.S. culture: \"I remember when Louis Armstrong first did it back for President Kennedy, one of my heroes. So it's nice to be following in his footsteps.\" As part of this role, Abdul-Jabbar has traveled to Brazil to promote education for local youths.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama announced in his last days of office that he has appointed Abdul-Jabbar along with Gabrielle Douglas & Carli Lloyd to the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar met Habiba Abdul-Jabbar (born Janice Brown) at a Lakers game during his senior year at UCLA. They eventually married and together had three children: daughters Habiba and Sultana and son Kareem Jr, who played basketball at Western Kentucky after attending junior college. Abdul-Jabbar and Janice divorced in 1978. He has another son, Amir, with Cheryl Pistono. Another son, Adam, made an appearance on the TV sitcom \"Full House\" with him.\n\nAt age 24 in 1971, he converted to Islam and became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, which means “the noble one, servant of the Almighty.” He was named by Hamaas Abdul Khaalis. Abdul-Jabbar purchased and donated 7700 16th Street NW, a house in Washington, D.C., for Khaalis to use as the Hanafi Madh-Hab Center. Eventually, Kareem \"found that [he] disagreed with some of Hamaas’ teachings about the Quran, and [they] parted ways.\"\n\nAbdul-Jabbar has spoken about the thinking that was behind his name change when he converted to Islam. He stated that he was \"latching on to something that was part of my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from Trinidad in the 18th century. My people were Yoruba, and their culture survived slavery...  My father found out about that when I was a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And that's a terrible burden on black people, because they don't have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted.\"\n\nIn 1998, Abdul-Jabbar reached a settlement after he sued Miami Dolphins running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar (now Abdul-Karim al-Jabbar, born Sharmon Shah) because he felt Karim was sponging off the name he made famous by having the Abdul-Jabbar moniker and number 33 on his Dolphins jersey. As a result, the younger Abdul-Jabbar had to change his jersey nameplate to simply \"Abdul\" while playing for the Dolphins. The football player had also been an athlete at UCLA.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar suffers from migraines, and his use of cannabis to reduce the symptoms has had legal ramifications.\n\nIn November 2009, Abdul-Jabbar announced that he was suffering from a form of leukemia, Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The disease was diagnosed in December 2008, but Abdul-Jabbar said his condition could be managed by taking oral medication daily, seeing his specialist every other month and having his blood analyzed regularly. He expressed in a 2009 press conference that he did not believe that the illness would stop him from leading a normal life.\n\nIn February 2011, Abdul-Jabbar announced via Twitter that his leukemia was gone and he was \"100% cancer free\". A few days later, he clarified his misstatement. \"You're never really cancer-free and I should have known that\", Abdul-Jabbar said. \"My cancer right now is at an absolute minimum\".\n\nIn April 2015, Abdul-Jabbar was admitted to hospital when he was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. Later that week, on his 68th birthday, he underwent quadruple coronary bypass surgery at the UCLA Medical Center. He was expected to make a full recovery.\n\nIn 2011, Abdul-Jabbar was awarded the Double Helix Medal for his work in raising awareness for cancer research. Also in 2011, Abdul-Jabbar received an honorary degree from New York Institute of Technology. In late 2016, Abdul-Jabbar was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the founding Chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and later for seizing power in Shanxi during the Cultural Revolution, where he made himself the top leader of the province. \n\nLiu spent his early days as a communist agitator, leading peasant uprisings and building the party organization in rural areas. A political survivor, he was arrested several times during the Warlord Era and served two prison terms. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he held important roles in the party and government but was branded a traitor in 1960. He later returned to work, only to be purged again several years later during the Cultural Revolution. He was rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution and spent the rest of his life in ceremonial positions.\n\nLiu Geping was born on 8 August 1904 into a large landowning family of Muslim Hui ethnicity in Dadi East Village (), Mengcun County, Hebei Province. He also used the names Liu Zimin () and Liu Xiangnong (). In 1918 he joined the army of Li Chun, a warlord of the Zhili Clique, and entered its military school in Nanjing. The next year he participated in the May Fourth Movement as an activist. He joined the Chinese Socialist Youth League in 1922, and returned home to spread revolutionary values. Instrumental in the founding of the first socialist youth cell in the area, in December 1925 he co-led an armed peasant uprising against the Beiyang government, the first of its kind in northern China. \n\nIn July 1926, Liu joined the Communist Party of China and then spearheaded a series of educational initiatives aimed at increasing the influence of the party in the Tianjin-Hebei region. After founding schools and party organizations in dozens of counties, he took part in the founding of a 300-strong \"Southern Tianjin Revolutionary Army\", which aimed to topple warlords and incite armed uprisings. In June 1928 he led a peasant uprising in Qingyun County, occupying the county seat and taking guns from the local police. He was arrested that year for his agitation and spent the next three years in prison. After he was released, the Communist Party sent him to Shaanxi to work for Yang Hucheng's army.\n\nAfter the Mukden incident and subsequent Japanese incursions into China, Liu became a founding member of the \"Hui People Against Japanese Invasion\" organization. In 1932 he returned home to work on military operations and to coordinate underground party activities. He was again arrested on April20, 1934, after organizing the Majia River () uprising in Qingyun. He was held in Caolanzi Prison () in Beijing, along with 61 other Communist Party leaders including Bo Yibo, An Ziwen, and Liu Lantao (no relation). To secure their release, the Communist Party Central Committee advised them to sign an announcement denouncing communism. Most complied and were released by the Kuomintang government, but Liu Geping was among the few who refused and served his full sentence.\n\nAfter his release in 1944, Liu took on more leadership roles within the Tianjin branch of the Communist Party. He then went to Shandong to found an organization for ethnic Hui to aid soldiers on the front lines of the Chinese Civil War. In March 1949, he went south with the People's Liberation Army to East China and served as vice-principal of the newly established East China People's Revolution University.\n\nIn September 1949, Liu Geping was selected as an ethnic minority representative to attend the first meeting of the Communist-led Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; he was ranked first among minority delegates. At the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949, he was selected to speak in Tiananmen Square as the official representative of China's minority peoples.\n\nLiu joined the government and became deputy director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission. In this capacity Liu frequently visited western areas with high minority populations. He was a delegate to the 1st National People's Congress in 1954. After the congress, Liu and the Tibetan communist Phünwang were assigned to accompany the 14th Dalai Lama, also a delegate, on his tour of Chinese cities, which had a great impact on the Dalai Lama.\n\nIn 1956, Liu was elected a member of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In 1958, Liu began heading up the party organization of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on an interim basis. He became the first Chairman of the autonomous region government in October 1958. Because he took a moderate approach to policies toward ethnic minorities, he was branded an \"ethnic splittist\" in 1960. In September he was dismissed from all of his positions and sent back to Beijing to take part in \"rehabilitation\" at the Central Party School.\n\nIn December 1965, Liu regained favour and was named Vice-Governor of Shanxi province. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, having gained the support of leftist radicals in Beijing, Liu successfully overthrew his superior Wei Heng and became Chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, the \"de facto\" top leader. Wei was imprisoned and committed suicide. Meanwhile, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, led by Kang Sheng and Jiang Qing, began to investigate the case of the 61 communist leaders who were instructed to denounce communism at Caolanzi Prison in the 1930s. The officials, notably Bo Yibo and An Ziwen, were branded as the \"61 Renegades Clique\" and persecuted. In contrast, Liu Geping was heralded as a hero for his refusal to sign the denunciation. He was invited to make speeches all over the country and was re-elected to the 9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in April 1969. However, Liu had also become involved in major disputes with the military leaders in Shanxi and was engaged in factional violence in the province. He was dismissed from office in July 1969, just three months after his re-election to the Central Committee. In 1970, he was sent to perform manual labour at a pottery factory in Tangshan. He was allowed to return to Beijing in 1975.\n\nAfter the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the pivotal 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the post-Mao Communist Party cleared Liu's name and declared that he \"did not have any political problems.\" In 1983, he was named a member of the National Committee of the 6th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a ceremonial position.\n\nLiu died in Beijing on 11 March 1992. He was given full funeral rites at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. His body was taken back to his native village and buried according to Muslim Hui rituals.\n\n"}

{"id": "27637276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27637276", "title": "Michael Roy Toney", "text": "Michael Roy Toney\n\nMichael Roy Toney (December 29, 1965 – October 3, 2009) was charged and wrongfully convicted in 1999 for a bombing that killed three people and injured two others in Lake Worth, Texas, in 1985. Toney was sentenced to death and spent ten years on death row. On December 17, 2008, Toney's conviction was vacated by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals because of prosecutorial misconduct. Toney was released from custody in September 2009 and died in a car accident about a month later.\n\nToney grew up in Cottonwood, California, a small town in Shasta County about north of Sacramento. His father left the family early in his life, and his mother worked in local taverns. She would bring home a number of men who would beat her and her sons. To escape from this, Toney would often retreat to a shed. When Toney was 9 or 10 years old, one of her boyfriends strapped him to a chair, duct-taped his wrists down and set fire to his hands. When he was 15, another one of his mother's boyfriends attacked him with a fishing gaff and gouged a huge hole in his hip. He quit school before the 10th grade and left for Texas, settling down in Hurst-Euless, in the Bedford area of Tarrant County. He married a woman named Kim when he was 38 years old.\n\nOn the evening of Thanksgiving Day, November 28, 1985, in the Hilltop Mobile Home Park between Lake Worth and Azle, Texas, several members of the Blount family were celebrating the holiday together in the Blounts' trailer. The family included Joe Blount, a 44-year-old skilled mechanic; his wife Susan; their 15-year-old daughter Angela; their son Robert; Joe's brother Carl; and Michael Columbus, Carl's son. \n\nAfter the family ate Thanksgiving dinner, Ray Blount went home around 5:00 p.m. Around 9:00 p.m., Susan Blount went to lie down for a nap. Joe Blount drove Robert, Angela and Michael to a convenience store about half a mile away from the park where they bought snacks and beer. Susan soon heard a knock at the front door. She looked out the window but did not see anybody, so she returned to her nap. When the rest of family returned from the convenience store, they discovered a briefcase on the doorstep. The three teenagers were excited because they thought that the briefcase might have either money or jewels in it. After bringing the briefcase inside, Angela opened the latches and it exploded. Joe, Angela, and Michael were killed when a bomb in the briefcase exploded.\n\nIn June 1997, Toney was in jail awaiting a hearing for a burglary that happened in 1993. Here he was talking to Charles \"Jack\" Ferris in Parker County Jail in Weatherford, Texas. The two men began talking about the bombing. Ferris was then released from jail by telling the Parker County authorities that Toney had confessed to him. After Ferris told the authorities, the investigators questioned Toney's ex-wife. In the beginning, Ms. Toney told prosecutors, \"Michael killing people in a bombing? You're nuts.\" But Ms. Toney decided to do some research on the case. When she realized what had taken place, she called federal agents and told her story. Soon after, Toney was indicted for capital murder.\n\nMonths passed, and Ferris changed his story about Toney's alleged confession to the crime. Ferris explained how Toney had come up with the story in order to get him out of jail earlier. He told investigators that \"Toney and me made up the entire thing.\"\n\nThe trial started in May 1999, in Fort Worth, Texas. Susan and Robert Blount gave their testimony as to what happened that day. Then the testimony from his ex-wife, his ex-best friend and another cellmate occurred. His ex-wife said that she, Toney and his best friend Chris Meeks went to a propane shop that was adjacent to the Hilltop Mobile Home Park. She says that Toney got out of the truck with a briefcase and disappeared. She then said he returned without the briefcase and they then went to the Nature Center and stayed for several hours. Her testimony also included that Toney shot a beaver with a rifle while they were at the Nature Center.\n\nA cellmate of Michael Toney, Finis Blankenship, testified that Toney told him that he was paid $5,000 for the murders. Blankenship also said that the murders were part of a drug-related hit, but the bomb was put on the wrong doorstep. His testimony came in the second phase of the trial. This helped the jury decide whether Toney deserved to be executed. This testimony showed the jury that Toney had a motive for the crime. At the time, Blankenship was facing two counts of indecency with a child and habitual-criminal charges, so he says that he agreed to testify against Toney in exchange for having the charges dropped. Blankenship now says that his testimony was a lie. Chris Meeks' testimony didn't coincide with all of Ms. Toney's testimony. Meeks changed his story four times. At first he told investigators that he knew nothing about the bombing as well as the grand jury. He also failed a polygraph test. In 2001, he signed an affidavit taking back the things he said during his testimony. He said, \"My testimony about the events that happened on Thanksgiving day, 1985, may not have happened on that day.\"\n\nToney said that he did not hear about the crime until 1997. He said that he had never been to the Hilltop Mobile Home Park and that he didn't he even know it existed until just prior to his trial. Ms. Toney and Mr. Meeks said that Toney was driving a truck on the night of the bombing. However, Toney said that he didn't buy the truck until December 13, 1985, a month after the incident.\n\nThe Tarrant County District Attorney's Office had withheld 14 pieces of evidence that were key to his defense. After this, Tarrant County prosecutors turned the case over to the Attorney General of Texas. The State of Texas subsequently dropped all charges against him and he was released on September 2, 2009. He died in an auto accident near Rusk, Texas, on October 3, 2009.\n\n"}

He has played a number of dark, troubled and morally or mentally ambiguous characters. Considine frequently collaborates with director Shane Meadows. He has starred in supporting roles in films such as \"24 Hour Party People\" (2002), \"In America\" (2003), \"My Summer of Love\" (2004), \"Cinderella Man\" (2005), \"Hot Fuzz\" (2007), \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" (2007), \"The World's End\" (2013) and \"Macbeth\" (2015), and leading roles in \"A Room for Romeo Brass\" (1999), \"Dead Man's Shoes\" (2004), \"The Cry of the Owl\" (2009), \"Blitz\" (2011), \"Honour\" (2014) and \"The Girl with All the Gifts\" (2016).\n\nConsidine came to prominence in the early 2000s with a string of performances in independent film that prompted \"The Observer\" to describe him as \"the best-kept secret in British movies\". In addition to leading and supporting roles in Hollywood films, he has acted in independent British films and television shows such as \"The Suspicions of Mr Whicher\" (2014). He wrote and directed \"Tyrannosaur\" (2011), a film based on his directorial debut, the 2007 short film \"Dog Altogether\". He has also acted in and directed several music videos, most notably Coldplay's video for \"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\" and the Arctic Monkeys video for \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\".\n\nConsidine has received an Evening Standard British Film Award, Empire Award and Thessaloniki Film Festival Awards, as well as eight other award nominations for his acting.

He won a second BAFTA Award, British Independent Film Award, and a World Cinema Directing Award at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival for \"Tyrannosaur\".\n\nConsidine was born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, where he still resides. He grew up with his brother and sisters in a council estate in Winshill, a suburb of Burton. Considine attended, among other schools, Abbot Beyne Senior School and Burton College. In 1990, Considine enrolled to do a National Diploma in Performing Arts at Burton College, where he first met Shane Meadows. Neither of them completed the course.\n\nIn 1994, Considine moved away to study photography at the University of Brighton. While there he studied under the social documentarian Paul Reas, who described one project, portraits of Considine's parents in their house in Winshill, as \"fucking brilliant\". At one point, Considine was threatened with expulsion, but graduated with a first-class B.A.\n\nAfter graduating from university, Meadows cast Considine in several short films, as well as his second film, \"A Room for Romeo Brass\" (1999). Considine, in his screen debut, played the disturbed character Morell. Considine's performance in the film led to Pawel Pawlikowski casting him in his first starring role in \"Last Resort\" (2000). Considine played the love-struck misfit Alfie, for which he won the Best Actor award at the Thessaloniki Film Festival. After coming to prominence for his roles as Alfie and Morell, Considine increased his profile during the early to mid-2000s with supporting and starring roles in cult films such as \"24 Hour Party People\" and \"In America\".\n\nIn 2004, Considine starred in what was then the most significant role of his career, as Richard in Meadows' revenge film \"Dead Man's Shoes\" (2004), a film he co-wrote and for which he won the Best British Actor award at the 2005 Empire Awards. In the same year, he starred in \"My Summer of Love\", his second film with director Pawel Pawlikowski. Both films were recognised on the award circuit, where Considine earned five nominations and two wins. The following year, Considine played Frank Thorogood (the suspected murderer of Rolling Stones co-founder Brian Jones) in \"Stoned\" (2005). It was around this time that Considine earned his reputation as a popular portrayer of cinema villains, antiheroes, and darker characters. 2005 also saw the release of Considine's second Hollywood film, \"Cinderella Man\".\n\nConsidine appeared in the Spanish thriller \"Bosque de Sombras\" (2006). It was during the filming of this that Considine penned what later became his debut short, \"Dog Altogether\". Considine claims that it was his co-star Gary Oldman who gave him confidence to make the film, which led to him thanking Oldman during his BAFTA acceptance speech. In 2006, he starred in \"Pu-239\" as Timofey Berezin, a worker at a Russian nuclear facility who gets exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. In 2007, Considine landed roles in two popular big budget films; the third film in the \"Bourne Trilogy\" film series, \"The Bourne Ultimatum\", in which he played newspaper reporter Simon Ross, and \"Hot Fuzz\", in which he had his first comedic role as DS Andy Wainwright. In 2008, Considine starred in \"My Zinc Bed\" a TV film for BBC / HBO. In 2009, he starred as Peter Hunter in the Channel 4 miniseries \"Red Riding: 1980\", based on the novels by David Peace, and another collaboration with Meadows, \"Le Donk & Scor-zay-zee\", a film which was unscripted, adlibbed, and filmed in five days at a cost of £48,000, and which premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2011, Considine starred in a film adaptation of Joe Dunthorne's book \"Submarine\", which Richard Ayoade wrote and directed. Also in 2011, Considine appeared as Porter Nash in the adaptation of the Ken Bruen novel \"Blitz\", as well as starring as Jack Whicher in \"The Suspicions of Mr Whicher\", written by Helen Edmundson and Neil McKay. In the same year, Considine was briefly reunited with one of his \"A Room for Romeo Brass\" co-stars, BAFTA-winning actress Vicky McClure. The two shared the screen in a television advert to promote \"Films for Life Season\". The ad was shot over two days in Spain.\n\nConsidine has consistently displayed a flair for regional and world accents; along with the Gypsy Midlander Morell in his first role in 1999's \"A Room for Romeo Brass\", Considine played a Londoner in \"Stoned\" and \"The Suspicions of Mr Whicher\", a Russian nuclear plant worker in \"Pu-239\", a Welshman in \"Submarine\", \"Happy Now\" and \"Pride\", an Irish immigrant in \"In America\", a Mancunian in \"Red Riding\", a Yorkshireman in \"My Summer of Love\", an American in \"Cry of the Owl\" and \"Cinderella Man\", and a West Countryman in \"Hot Fuzz\". He has appeared in several music videos, most notably \"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\" (2002) by Coldplay and Moloko's \"Familiar Feeling\" (2003), as well as the Arctic Monkeys track \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\" (2006), for which he wrote the video.\n\nConsidine starred in \"The World's End\", as one of the \"Five Musketeers\" reattempting an \"epic\" pub crawl. Considine previously worked with the cast and crew on \"Hot Fuzz\" (2007). The film was released in the United Kingdom on 19 July 2013, and the United States on 23 August 2013. In August 2015, Considine confirmed that he was writing the screenplay for the film \"Journeyman\", in which he will also star. It is an adaptation of non-fiction novel \"The Years of the Locust\" by Jon Hotten, the true story of a sociopathic boxing promoter, Fat Rick Parker, and his doomed relationship with his naive fighter, Tim Anderson. Considine is also writing a film from a ghost story called \"The Leaning\", with plans to direct both films. He will continue to work with Shane Meadows on \"King of the Gypsies\", a biopic of bare-knuckle fighter Bartley Gorman, whom Considine met and became friends with whilst working as a photographer.

R. Carey.\n\nOn 4 October 2015, it was via Considine's official Twitter page that he was about to join the cast of Birmingham-set gangster series \"Peaky Blinders\", seeing him reunited with \"She Who Brings Gifts\" director Colm McCarthy.\n\nIn April 2017, Considine made his professional stage debut in \"The Ferryman\" at the Royal Court Theatre, ahead of a transfer to the Gielgud Theatre in the West End. It is the fastest selling play in Royal Court Theatre history.\n\nIn 2007, Paddy Considine wrote and directed the award-winning short film \"Dog Altogether\", starring Peter Mullan, partially based on Considine's father. \"Dog Altogether\" won the 2007 BAFTA award for Best Short Film, as well as a Silver Lion for Best Short Film at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, a Best British Short at the 2007 British Independent Film Awards (BIFA), and the Seattle International Film Festival Short Film Jury Award (Narrative Special Jury Prize), as well as a World Cinema Directing Award for his feature directorial debut \"Tyrannosaur\" at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nAfter a short stint in a virtual comedy thrash group called Grunt during college, Considine and Shane Meadows formed the band She Talks To Angels (inspired by the Black Crowes song of the same name) with friends Richard Eaton, Simon Hudson, and Nick Hemming, with Meadows as vocalist and Considine as drummer. Considine left the band, the remaining members re-formed, calling themselves Oslo. Appearing on Jools Holland's show, whilst Considine had moved on to study photography at the University of Brighton, where he formed a new group, a Britpop band called Pedestrians. He is now in a rock band called Riding the Low, who have released an EP 'They Will Rob You of Your Gifts' (2009), and an album 'What Happened to the Get To Know Ya?' (2013).\n\nConsidine and Riding the Low got their big music break in 2014 after Tim Burgess of the Charlatans invited them to perform at his curated Tim Peaks Diner event at Festival No 6 in Portmeirion, Wales. Considine had contacted Burgess after reading his book Telling Stories, to discuss meditation. \"The conversation developed and Tim generously offered to let us play at Portmeirion, It led to the band supporting the Charlatans at the O2 Academy in Leicester this year. I didn't get stage fright. We were ready. We did our history off-camera. We have evolved. We have got better. At first it was raw – all we had was arrogance. We had a long way to go and we learnt our craft at all these pub gigs. We didn't expect a leg-up just because an actor is in the band.\" said Considine\n\n2016 saw the band release their second full-length album \"Are Here to Help the Neighbourhood\", recorded in Rockfield Studios and produced by Chris Slusarenko. Considine penned the words while the band wrote the music.\n\nIn early 2018, Considine confirmed that the long anticipated collaboration with Wigan saxophonist Andrew Teddy Brown would finally be released in February 2019 as a concept album entitled Limping Through Life - an epic tale of the struggle faced by a man with a terminal form of Gout. In November 2018, Considine and Brown confirmed that the debut single from Limping Through Life would be called Days Of Delirium - a song about the extreme highs felt by the album’s central character after taking suppositories to combat Gout.\n\nConsidine remains private in his personal life and once stated that if he ever became a celebrity, he'd \"disappear and go and make shoes like Daniel Day-Lewis\" (a reference to Day-Lewis' sabbatical working as a shoemaker in Italy). Considine lives in his home town of Burton upon Trent with his family. Considine's late father was Irish. He has been with his wife Shelley since he was 18 years old.\n\nIn April 2011, Considine revealed that he had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Although initially reassured by the diagnosis, he continued to struggle in social situations until he was diagnosed in 2013 with Irlen syndrome, a condition in which the brain cannot adequately process visual stimuli. His condition has improved significantly since he began wearing purple Irlen filters.\n\n"}

She was raised by her caring grandmother Nosifako Elizabeth Mabele and her grandfather July Mabele as her mother was in exile and her father an Umkhotho wesizwe soldier. The first of four sisters, Prudence left Wattville for Pietermaritzburg to obtain secondary education and afterward attended the Witwatersrand Technikon and Cape Town Technikon in 1990 when she was first diagnosed with HIV infection. Despite several challenges occasioned by the diagnosis of HIV infection at a young age, Prudence successfully obtained a Diploma in Light Current Electrical Engineering in 1994. Her other academic accomplishments include a Diploma in Psychology Intec College, 1996), a Diploma in Management from the Wits Business School and Certificates on “Women in Management”, “HIV and AIDS Leadership” and “Monitoring and Evaluation for Sexual and Reproductive Health Programs.6\n\nMabele completed her training as a sangoma (traditional doctor) in 2004.\n\nAt her death, Mabele was the President of the Society for Women and AIDS in Africa, Executive Director of Positive Women's Network, an organisation she founded, and Deputy Chair of the Civil Society Forum - South African National AIDS Council.\n\nMabele was also a founding co-chair of WomenNOW! Summit on Pan-African & African Diasporan Women's Sexual & Reproductive Health and Justice.\n\nPrudence has held several leadership positions including being a founding member of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and the National Association of People Living with HIV and AIDS (NAPWA) in 1994; a founding member and former executive committee Chair of the AIDS Consortium. 6\n\nMabele was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1990. She stated that she \"looked for people she could share her anxiety with. But her search for a friend led her to hospital wards full of dying babies\". It was during this time that she saw the need for a support group for women.\n\n\"In 1992 spurred by the need to act against the silence and stigma that surrounded HIV Mabele took the bold step to become one of the first black women in South Africa to publicly disclose her HIV status at a time when the first democratic elections were two years away and HIV was associated with white gay men. She was then forced to change her course of study from Medical Technology to Electrical Engineering because of perceived risks to future patients she might work with. This defining decision prepared her for a long and challenging professional life in which she steadfastly stood up for herself as a young woman living with HIV and promoted policies and programs that would benefit women in general. For example, as far back as 1996, Mabele through her work with Yale University and the South African Department of Health was instrumental in introducing female condoms to South Africa. \" 6 \n\n\"Mabele responded positively to her own situation at a tender age and learned to confront and challenge prejudices both at the community level and in the healthcare profession. Within South Africa and outside South Africa, she has contributed enormously toward the “meaningful participation of people living with HIV”, ensuring that they are just not seen but listened to and their expertise utilized. Without a doubt, she has been one of the key global champions highlighting the gravity of the issues faced by girls and young women on the continent in the context of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\" 6 \n\n\"As a volunteer at the Red Cross Children’s Hospital counselling HIV positive mothers and babies in 1993, Prudence became inspired by this experience to found the Positive Women Network in 1996 to address the social and reproductive health needs of positive women.\"6 In 1996, Mabele and five other women founded the Positive Women's Network of South Africa \"to provide a space for HIV positive women to address our economic, educational and health needs and to project our voices and demands for services, rights and respect..\" \n\nAs one of South Africa’s leading spokespersons and an advocate for people living with HIV, in 2004 Mabele carried the Olympic torch as part of an international torch relay for the 2004 Olympics in Greece.\n\nMabele was renowned for her work with women's HIV support groups. Colleague and friend Sisonke Msimang wrote of her: \"Donors stopped funding support groups because they were no longer fashionable. But Pru knew the truth, which was that life for women happens in conversations, in the time it takes to sit with one another. Those groups were emotional life support for women who were in critical condition, whose lives had been shattered and whose hearts needed piecing together. Pru did that work. She visited so many grieving families. When lesbians were killed, Pru went. When another HIV-positive woman died, Pru was there. When a woman was murdered, Pru was at the front. Painted up, dolled up, voice ragged, breathing through her mouth, swearing and joking and sweating, she was there.\"\n\nMabele was a strong advocate for ending violence against women and was a member of the One in Nine Campaign. One in Nine began in response to the rape trial of Jacob Zuma, who was at that time, Deputy President. One in Nine is named for the fact that only One in Nine women in South Africa reports crime to the police, a stark piece of evidence as to how inaccessible and unwelcoming the police and judicial system in SA is. \n\nMabele herself said: \"I believe that the quality of women’s leadership is even more important than the numbers of women in leadership.\"\n\nMabele was one of the founding members of the Bring Back Our Girls South Africa campaign.\n\nMabele also starred in a film called Sunshine Boutique.\n\n\"For over two decades, Prudence has played a pioneering and leading role in the fight against HIV/AIDS and has been recognized internationally, nationally and regionally for her dedicated contribution to the HIV response.\" 6 \n\n\"Mabele made her global debut at the Beijing Women’s Conference in 1995, in which she was a previously unknown young woman from the African continent who counselled everyone, including the powerful, about the need to seek solutions from those directly experiencing the effects of the epidemic.\"6\n\n\"On the regional and global level, Prudence worked extensively from 1997 in different countries as a member of the Commonwealth program called Positive Young Ambassadors of Hope which attempted to increase the visibility of HIV and youth. This opened the door for her work with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a GIPA (Greater Involvement of People living with HIV and AIDS) consultant to enhance the acceptance of HIV positive persons in the workplace. Her other assignments include those with UNAIDS, United Nations Development Program, UNFPA, the World Bank, the African Union, and the governments of Venezuela, Botswana, Nigeria and the United States. She has also supported the work of numerous international organisations such as Oxfam, Voluntary Services Overseas, the European Union Human Rights Foundation, Amnesty International, the Centre for Development and Population Activities, the Population Council and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission and the Society of Women and AIDS in Africa. One of Mabele's key strengths was her ability to maintain ties locally, nationally, regionally and internationally and to permeate these spaces with a message of hope and resilience.\" 6\n\n\"It is a tribute to her international profile that Prudence was one of the Olympic torch bearers for the Athens 2004 Olympic Torch Relay event where the theme was \"Pass the flame, unite the world\". This worldwide relay united the five continents and travelled to 33 cities in 26 countries.\" 6\n\n\"At the World Social Forum in Brazil in 2005, Prudence gave a presentation on defending women’s knowledge against free trade agreement. This information was shared with indigenous women from Latin America, and included discussions about traditional medicines – and how this century-old wisdom has often been stolen by trans-national pharmaceutical companies – without compensation.\" 6 \n\n\"It was no surprise given Prudence’s contributions on the continent and globally, that the African Women’s Development Fund’s in 2010 honoured her with Woman of Substance Award for being a mobilizer par excellence with a vision and commitment to the advancement of women with HIV and AIDS and a source of hope to women.\"\n\n\"In 2010, Prudence was on the cover page of one of UNAIDS Outlook Reports. She was quoted thus “One of the greatest satisfactions I get from my work is to see a woman taking the steps toward knowing herself, accepting her HIV status, learning to stay healthy and ultimately becoming a leader and agent of change”. This is precisely what Mabele’s life has been about.\" 6 \n\nMabele was herself a trained sangoma and took ARVs when they became available on the public health system in South Africa. She supported the use of ARVs because she herself had first-hand seen the destruction caused by AIDS. Mabele answered her calling to become a traditional healer several years after starting ARVs, and almost a decade after she found out her HIV status. \n\nMabele was, in fact, the target of a march in 2004 when more than 500 traditional healers marched to give her a petition against the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). The issue was that TAC was only promoting ARVs and not traditional medicine. \n\n\"That was very interesting. I had to go and collect their memorandum. Antiretrovirals [ARVs] were still new in South Africa and, as a healer, I was taking ARVs. It was serious. It was hectic. I was scared. They all looked at me as a traitor. I remember them coming [down the street], toyi-toying and singing 'phansi ngo Prudence' [down with Prudence]! They were saying that we [TAC] are more into ARVs than their herbs. But that was not the case. I am a healer; being on [medical] treatment helps me to stay balanced, it helps me to do all my rituals and it helps me to dance. It makes me feel good.\"\n\n\"For Prudence, hard work goes with fun and happiness. Those who know her well know that she is constantly on the move and makes every attempt to live her life to the fullest. She enjoys music, movies, arts, and drama. She loves clothes and shoes and admires the creativity of many South African designers. Prudence’s love for the arts and nature stems from the inner fulfilment she derides and the way in which these uplift her spiritually and connect with her African identity. There is so much we can say about Prudence – I believe most positive and reaffirming. However, she would like to describe herself as a woman that is a God-loving feminist and believes in women‘s rights, and the need to love and reach out to other people no matter their personal circumstances.\" Eka Williams at Mabele's 40th Birthday Celebration.6\n\nPrudence Mabele died from pneumonia on 10th July 2017. The family of Prudence Mabele announced her death saying:\n\n\"It is with profound sorrow that the Mabale family announces the death of their daughter Prudence Nobantu Mabele. A leading advocate for people living with HIV & AIDS, a respected gender activist, and one of the first black women in South Africa to disclose her HIV status...\" \n\nSource: see References.\n\nMabele was the recipient of many awards over the years due to her untiring work on health and human rights:\n\nSource: see References. \n\n\n\nHerstory - Her voice - Videos of Mabele\n"}

He was a number 8 for Wales, Llanelli RFC, Llanelli Scarlets, Richmond and the British and Irish Lions in rugby union. He won 52 caps for Wales (seven as captain) and three for the Lions, and scored 11 international tries for Wales and one for the Lions.\n\nIn 1994 he moved to Wigan in rugby league, and played two seasons, winning a league championship and two caps for Wales.\n\nScott was born in Morriston, Swansea, Glamorgan, Wales. He is the son of former Welsh international Derek Quinnell. His two brothers Craig, and Gavin played professional rugby union. Gavin lost the sight in one eye after an incident in a 2010 match. The brothers are also nephews of Welsh international Barry John, and Quinnell's godfather was Mervyn Davies.\n\nQuinnell first joined the Llanelli juniors aged 8 and he made his début as an 18-year-old back in 1990 against Pen-y-groes. He went on to represent Llanelli on 146 occasions, scoring 69 tries.\n\nQuinnell first played for Wales as a blindside flanker in a 26-24 defeat against Canada in 1993. He was part of the 1994 Five Nations-winning Welsh team and was man of the match in Wales' 24-15 victory over France that year with a try and a breakaway to set up another try.\n\nHe switched to rugby league in 1994, joining Wigan. He stayed with Wigan for two years, and during this time he won the league. Quinnell played loose forward in Wigan's 25-16 victory over St. Helens in the 1996 Regal Trophy final. He also represented Wales in the 1995 Rugby League World Cup. He said that the toughest game of rugby he ever played was the quarter-final against Western Samoa. Wales went out to England 25-10 in the semi-finals.\n\nQuinnell returned to rugby union with Richmond in 1996. He was selected for the 1997 Lions tour of South Africa but a double hernia operation forced him to leave the tour.\n\nHe came back to his beloved Stradey Park in 1998. During the 1998-99 season he did no conditioning work at all as he had rheumatoid arthritis in his left knee. For seven years he played through the pain barrier with the condition that seemed likely to end his career.\n\nHe was part of a Welsh team that won eight straight games before the 1999 World Cup and then reached the World Cup quarter-finals where they went out 24-9 to the eventual winners Australia. He captained Wales for the first time in a 23-13 defeat by South Africa at the Millennium Stadium. Quinnell played his last game for Wales as a replacement in a 32-21 win over Canada in 2002 after winning 52 caps.\n\nHe was again selected for the 2001 Lions tour to Australia where he played in all three tests, and scored a try in the first test in Brisbane.\n\nAfter the Welsh domestic game went regional in 2003, he appeared 59 times for the Scarlets, scoring 32 tries.

Having lived all of his life in Llanelli, in early 2009 in light of his increased media commitments, the family moved to Kenilworth, Warwickshire, although they have since moved back to South Wales to a smallholding near Usk.\n\nQuinnell is dyslexic, but was not diagnosed until his early 30s, when his lack of ability to read and write was correctly diagnosed. Having undertaken a series of therapies to resolve the condition, Quinnell is now a popular speaker on the matter. He has represented the Welsh Dyslexia Project, and also completed an autobiography as part of the Accent Press Quick Reads series.\n\nIn August 2007 Quinnell was treated for serious injuries after slipping whilst entering a shower and falling through a glass shower door at his then home near Llanelli. He was taken to West Wales General Hospital in Carmarthen with a severed right triceps, and glass embedded in his right arm, hand and knee.\n\nIn 2017, Quinnell published a book on business leadership with Paul Boross.\n\n"}

He was the younger brother of James Joyce. He was generally known as Stanislaus Joyce to distinguish him from his father, who shared the same name.\n\nBorn in County Dublin, Stanislaus was considered a \"whetstone\" by his more famous brother, who shared his ideas and his books with him. He was three years younger than James, and a constant boyhood companion. Stanislaus rebelled against his native Ireland as his brother had done, and, in 1905, he joined James's household in Trieste on Via Caterina, 1.\n\nJoyce worked as an English-language teacher in the Berlitz School alongside his brother. In 1903, he had already begun to keep a diary that recorded his own thoughts on philosophical and literary matter as well as those of his brother; he later resumed this diary in Trieste. This \"Book of Days\", as he called it, sheds light on James Joyce's life between the years 1906 and 1909. The diary indicates that Stanislaus, truly \"his brother's keeper\", was called upon to rescue his brother from financial difficulties time and time again. After 1908, he maintained his own address, although he may have lived with his brother again for a time in 1909. \nArrested as a subversive on December 28, 1914, at the beginning of World War I, he was interned by the Austrians at Katzenau, near Linz. After his release, he moved in with his sister Eileen's family. Stanislaus took his brother's teaching position at Trieste's Scuola Superiore di Commercio \"Revoltella\" in 1920; this school later became assimilated into the University of Trieste and he continued on as a non-tenured professor of English until his death. Due to his anti-Fascist views, Stanislaus moved to Florence sometime in 1941, where he may have been protected from the Germans by various wealthy Italian and American families.\n\nJoyce later published \"Recollections of James Joyce\" (1950); published after his death on June 16 (\"Bloomsday\") were \"My Brother's Keeper\" (1957), \"Dublin Diary\" (1962), and \"Complete Dublin Diary\" (1971). In the 1950s, Stanislaus had also assisted Richard Ellmann, his brother's biographer, with Ellmann's monumental \"James Joyce\" (1959). Hel also wrote an introduction for the translated version of Italo Svevo's \"As A Man Grows Older\".\n\nStanislaus often fought with his brother, as well as with his brother's wife Nora Barnacle, but they shared a common literary philosophy despite the fact that Stanislaus had received less advanced schooling than his brother. Stanislaus, however, channelled these instincts into sober academic study rather than wild flights of literary fancy. Of his brother, Stanislaus wrote, \n\nOn 13 August 1928 Stanislaus married Nelly Lichtensteiger. They had one son, James, who was born in February 1943.\n\nStanislaus died in the Free Territory of Trieste, and is buried in Trieste at the \"Via della Pace\" cemetery.\n\n"}
{"id": "253630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253630", "title": "Thomas Starr King", "text": "Thomas Starr King\n\nThomas Starr King (December 17, 1824 – March 4, 1864) was an American Universalist and Unitarian minister, influential in California politics during the American Civil War, and Freemason. Starr King spoke zealously in favor of the Union and was credited by Abraham Lincoln with preventing California from becoming a separate republic. He is sometimes referred to as \"the orator who saved the nation.\"\n\nHe was born on December 17, 1824, in New York City to Rev. Thomas Farrington King, a Universalist minister, and Susan Starr King. The sole support of his family at 15, he was forced to leave school. Inspired by men like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Ward Beecher, King embarked on a program of self-study for the ministry. At the age of 20 he took over his father's former pulpit at the Charlestown Universalist Church in Charlestown, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1849, he was appointed pastor of the Hollis Street Church in Boston, where he became one of the most famous preachers in New England. He vacationed in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and in 1859 published a book about the area entitled \"The White Hills; their Legends, Landscapes, & Poetry\". In 1860 he accepted a call from the First Unitarian Church of San Francisco, California. In July of that year, he visited Yosemite and was moved spiritually by its splendor. Upon returning to San Francisco, he began preaching a series of sermons on Yosemite, published letters about it in the \"Boston Evening Transcript\", and aligned himself with fellow abolitionist and landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, to have Yosemite set aside as a reserve. Yosemite would become a California State Park and eventually a National park. Starr King joined the Freemasons and was raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason in Oriental Lodge No. 144 in San Francisco, now Phoenix Lodge No. 144, and served as grand orator of the Grand Lodge of California in 1863.\n\nStarr King's younger brother, Edward Starr King, served as captain of the clipper ship \"Syren.\" Capt. Starr King arrived in San Francisco aboard \"Syren\" just two days after his elder brother's stirring 1861 speech about Washington and the Union, remarking, \"Starr has the brains of the family, and I the brawn.\"\nDuring the Civil War, Starr King spoke zealously in favor of the Union and was credited by Abraham Lincoln with preventing California from becoming a separate republic. At the urging of Jessie Benton Frémont, Starr King teamed up with writer Bret Harte, and Starr King read Harte's patriotic poems at pro-Union speeches. Starr King also read original verses by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and James Russell Lowell which captured the imagination of the Californians. In a letter by Starr King wrote to James T. Fields, the editor of the \"Atlantic Monthly\", \"The state must be Northernized thoroughly, by schools, Atlantic Monthlies, lectures, N.E. preachers.\"\n\nIn addition, he organized the Pacific Branch of the United States Sanitary Commission, which raised money and medical materials for wounded soldiers and was the predecessor to the American Red Cross. A fiery orator, he raised more than $1.5 million for the Sanitary Commission headquarters in New York City, one-fifth of the total contributions from all the states in the Union.\nThe relentless lecture circuit exhausted him, and he died in San Francisco on March 4, 1864, of diphtheria and pneumonia. His dying words were said to be, \"Keep my memory green.\" Over twenty thousand people attended his funeral and several of his friends including Charles Stoddard, Bret Harte and Ina Coolbrith published tributes. King is interred at First Unitarian Church of San Francisco between Starr King and Geary Streets in San Francisco. In the 1940s, most of San Francisco's dead were disinterred and moved to new resting places outside city limits; the grave of Starr King was one of the very few allowed to remain undisturbed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of honors originally paid to Rev. King, he was judged worthy of representing California in the National Statuary Hall Collection displayed in the United States Capitol. In 1913, King was voted one of California's two greatest heroes and funds were appropriated for a statue. In 1931, California officially donated a bronze statue of King to be mounted in Statuary Hall.\n\nOn August 31, 2006, however, the California Legislature approved a joint resolution to replace Thomas Starr King's statue in Statuary Hall with a statue of Ronald Reagan. The resolution was authored by Republican State Senator Dennis Hollingsworth, who stated the reason for the resolution as, \"To be honest with you, I wasn't sure who Thomas Starr King was, and I think there's probably a lot of Californians like me.\" He also went on to observe that King was not a native of the state though, of course, neither is Reagan (nor was Junipero Serra, the other statue representing California in Statuary Hall).\n\nAs a result of this resolution, King's statue was removed from Statuary Hall, and the statue of Ronald Reagan was placed in Statuary Hall on June 10, 2009. In November 2009, Starr King's statue was reinstalled within the Civil War Memorial Grove in Capitol Park, which surrounds the California State Capitol in Sacramento. It was formally dedicated in a ceremony held on December 8, 2009.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1779340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1779340", "title": "Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)", "text": "Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Thor (Thorlief Golmen) is a fictional superhero based on the Marvel Universe version of Thor. Thor is the Asgardian God of Thunder based on the deity of the same name of Norse mythology and a founding member of the Ultimates.\n\nThor was adapted from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's comic book version of Thor by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch, first appearing in \"The Ultimates\". \"Ultimate Thor\" is the alter-ego of Thorlief Golmen, an anarchist who discovered he is the reincarnated form of the Norse warrior Thor. The \"Ultimate\" redesign of the character reduces the number of Thor's powers, and reduces the character's reliance upon his hammer, Mjolnir, as a source of power. Perhaps most significantly, the Thunder God's long-established personality is drastically altered, changing him from an eager and willing divine combatant into an ecocentric, arguably unstable, and somewhat reluctant warrior.\n\nUltimate Thor was once a psychiatric nurse called Thorlief Golmen until suffering a nervous breakdown before his 30th birthday. During the 18 months he spent institutionalized, he claims to have realized who he is and why he has been sent to Earth. He claimed to be Thor, Norse god of thunder, on a mission to save the planet and to stop the \"war to end all wars\". Thor himself claims to have known who he was since he was twelve years old, and that his nervous breakdown only brought him further clarity. His political and social activism, as well as his own self-help books, attracted rebellious hippies and conspiracy theorists. He spoke against America's military aggression towards other world powers and the military-industrial complex.\n\nHis background is made less clear due to his brother Loki's reality manipulations, and later stories try to reconcile this history with the existence of Asgard.\n\nIn \"The Ultimates\", when General Nick Fury contacted Thor about joining the Ultimates, Thor refused to work for the military-industrial complex that he detests. When the Hulk appeared in Manhattan, Thor refused to assist unless the President doubled the foreign aid budget. Not long after the Ultimates confronted the Hulk, the President relented and Thor appeared in time to save Captain America from Banner. Following the battle, Thor became good friends with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, pledging his support whenever lives are in danger. Over dinner, he explains to Stark and Rogers his origins and insists that he is the genuine article. Soon thereafter, Thor was briefed on the Chitauri and sent to investigate a suspected Chitauri base in Micronesia. They were saved by Iron Man's force field after they discovered the base abandoned and ready to explode. Once a Chitauri fleet appeared in Arizona, Thor brought the survivors there. He and Iron Man then provided air support against the Chitauri spacecraft until the Air Force arrived. After Iron Man asked Thor to help him dispose of the Chitauri bomb that would obliterate the entire solar system, Thor teleported it to the wastes of Náströnd, a deserted world in the Asgardian cosmos where its detonation caused only a small ripple in our space-time.\n\nIn \"Ultimate War\", Thor appears as a member of the Ultimates, retrieving the dead with Iron Man after the attack in issue one. When Magneto attacks the Ultimates, he says he is surprised to see Thor with the Ultimates, and asks him if he thinks he can change them. Thor throws Mjolnir at the Master of Magnetism, but Magneto manages to stop it an inch from his helmet and throws it back at Thor, sending him through a wall. Thor joins the Ultimates in attacking the X-Men later on; he fought Storm but is defeated by Colossus.\n\nIn \"Ultimate Six\", Thor appears with the Ultimates while bringing in Kraven the Hunter, although he refuses Captain America's requests to catch Kraven or bring him back. He is seen aiding in reconstruction efforts in Bosnia when summoned following the Six's breakout. Thor is the one who defeats Electro during the climactic battle at the White House.\n\nIn \"Ultimate Secret\", Thor and Iron Man escort the Fantastic Four to Nevada. When the Kree attack the base, Thor, Black Widow, Johnny Storm, and The Thing fight off the aliens. As he is idolized by Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, he fraternizes with them to the point of ordering Carol Danvers to prepare a keg of beer for after the battle.\n\nThor has appeared or been mentioned in several storylines of the Ultimate Fantastic Four. Reed Richards at one point created infant hard light versions of the Ultimates and thought Thor to be the most powerful superhuman on the planet. This was proved wrong when Namor appeared to be physically stronger. In another storyline an interdimensional parasite that sought out the most powerful being on the planet bypassed a present Thor and possessed Doctor Doom. This is attributed to a combination of Doom’s physical states and knowledge of Atlantean magic.\n\nThor appeared as a minor character in an alternate timeline as the President of the United States due to time travel involving Skrull invaders. In it his powers were described as “natural.” This alternate version was killed during the Skrull invasion and ceased to exist when the timeline was erased.\n\nThor appeared in a later storyline involving Thanos. He stated he had fought Thanos in the past and tried to fight him again along with the rest of the Ultimates. He was quickly defeated due to Thanos possessing the Cosmic Cube and turned into a tree. This was undone when Thanos was defeated by the Fantastic Four.\n\nIn \"Ultimates 2\" Thor has resigned from the Ultimates due to his belief that the team has become a tool for American foreign policy. In a restaurant, he meets fellow Asgardian Volstagg, also reincarnated as a human being, who warns him his half-brother Gunnar Golmen/Loki has escaped and is shifting reality on Earth to strike at Thor. Volstagg is then erased from reality making it look like Thor is delusional. After Bruce Banner’s identity of the Hulk is leaked to the public, Captain America accuses Thor of the act, but Thor denies the charge and tries to warn Captain America of Loki's influence, but his warnings are rejected as are his claims to be Thor. An anti-super-soldier demonstration in Italy turns violent due to Loki’s interference. When Thor intervenes on behalf of the protesters, the incident is used as an excuse for the Ultimates to team with the European Defence Initiative’s super-soldiers to arrest him. The EDI’s head scientist, Gunnar Golmen, reveals that Thor’s powers are technological in nature, coming from his belt and hammer. Gunnar explains that Thor is really his own mentally troubled brother who stole the equipment and has been being acting as Thor, God of Thunder, ever since. Gunnar claims the equipment gives Thor physical strength and powers beyond anyone else on the planet, and that he is too dangerous to take on alone.\n\nThor is tracked to Norway. After he fails to convince the Ultimates that Gunnar is really a masquerading Loki manipulating reality, a battle ensues. Despite initially holding his own, Thor is eventually overwhelmed and has to call upon a storm. At the last moment, Quicksilver is able to remove his belt stripping Thor of his powers and his ability to use Mjolnir. Thor is then locked up in the Triskelion all the time being mocked by Loki, who is invisible to all but him and attempts to convince him that he is insane.\n\nThor is imprisoned in the Triskelion until the last issue of the series, where his attempts to warn the Ultimates about the coming dangers are ignored. Following the Liberators' conquest of America, Thor is freed by Odin (this is helped by Scarlet Witch using her mutant hex power to effect the probability of Thor regaining his power) and restored to full power in time to battle a revealed Loki. At first Loki has the upper hand by using his powers over reality to become immune to Thor’s hammer and overpowering the thunder god while summoning an army of Asgardian monsters to kill the Ultimates. After an army of Asgardian warriors arrive to fight the monsters, Loki’s powers stop working for unknown reasons. During the battle Loki reveals he is responsible for creating the idea of a Norwegian super-soldier program and framing Captain America. Thor is able to destroy Loki’s mortal form and send his spirit back to Odin for punishment. Now vindicated in his claims of godhood, Thor learns that the Ultimates will no longer be working for the government, and rejoins the team.\n\nIn \"Ultimate Power\", Thor appears alongside the rest of the new Ultimates alongside Nick Fury arriving to battle the Squadron Supreme when they destroy the roof of the Baxter Building. After the battle Thor used his hammer to teleport the Helicarrier with the team to the Supremeverse. There he engages Hyperion in combat, but is defeated by the former's superior speed.\n\nIn \"Ultimate Power\" #7 Thor gains the upper hand against Hyperion, felling him with a huge bolt of lightning then severely beating him with Mjolnir. He also knocks back Zarda as she attempts to stop him from beating Hyperion.\n\nIn \"Ultimates 3\" Thor undergoes many changes making him closer to his mainstream counterpart. He is redesigned with a beard and a bulkier build. He becomes much more eager for battle and more vengeful. His ax/hammer is replaced with one closer to the mainstream version of Mjolnir in look. He has formed a romantic relationship with Valkyrie, who has mysteriously gained superhuman powers. He starts speaking in a Shakespearean pattern, claiming it is the way he truly speaks and with his godhood no longer in doubt feels he no longer has to hide it. During the course of the story he reveals he has a collection of weapons which were a gift from Odin forged by Ulik the troll. The ax/hammer weapon is among them.\n\nDuring the course of the story Thor aids the team when the Brotherhood of Mutants attacks their mansion. He later travels to the Savage Land with the Ultimates to confront Magneto. He once again battles Magneto, but is quickly defeated and buried near the center of the Earth. After the true mastermind behind the events is revealed, Thor attempts to confront Magneto again, but Magneto uses his powers to take Thor's hammer from him and then leaves. Following this, Thor begins using a sword.\n\nDonald Blake also appeared in the first issue of the series as the doctor who attempted to revive the Scarlet Witch after she was shot. Blake was never seen again in the series; however he later would appear in \"Ultimate Thor\" where he is revealed to be Balder, Thor and Loki's brother and Odin's eyes and ears, revived in human form after being murdered by Loki.\n\nAs mentioned, Magneto uses Thor's hammer to create worldwide destruction. During these events Thor, upon finding Valkyrie's lifeless body, enters Valhalla to reclaim her soul. He is then confronted by Hela, who forces Thor to battle Hela's army of fallen warriors to reach Valkyrie. Captain America suddenly appears in Valhalla, implying that he has died. In Valhalla, Thor sacrifices himself to save Valkyrie and Captain America from Hela and this allows them to go back to live.\n\nIn \"New Ultimates\" #1 he is shown still imprisoned, demanding Hela returns him to Earth and to Valkyrie. She tells him she will give him whatever his heart desires in exchange for a son. The next issue has a vision shown to Valkyrie by Amora where he is making love with Hela as he had no other choice. Later Hela tells him that another soul is still needed for him to leave, Thor says it will be hers but finds himself unable to kill her because she is already pregnant. At the end of the issue he is resurrected at the price of the death of Valkyrie. Thor then goes into a rage searching for his brother and attacking the Ultimates in the process until he finally finds him and gets his hammer back with the Ultimates watching as he is still extremely angry.\n\nThor remained in the Ultimates when they were employed by Carol Danvers and battled Nick Fury's black-ops team codenamed the Avengers. At this point, Thor was back in a relationship with Jane Foster and shared an apartment with her and began to talk like a \"normal person\" again when Tony Stark promised to donate money to charity if Thor gave up his Asgardian \"faux-Shakespearean\" speech-pattern. In the final battle during the revolution in North Korea organised by Gregory Stark, Thor and the Ultimates battled Gregory, whose superpowered suit made him too powerful to defeat until Iron Man disabled it with an electromagnetic pulse, giving Thor the opportunity to kill Gregory on the spot with a lightning bolt.\n\nThor's return and rejoining into the Ultimates was confirmed in the pages of \"Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man\", where he is seen as one of the Ultimates. Director Danvers asks his advice, and one of the Ultimates who will teach Spider-Man to be a hero. He is later shown attending Peter Parker's funeral, where he reflects that he has also seen Peter dining in Valhalla with the deceased X-Men and Ultimates members.\n\n\"Ultimate Comics: Thor\" reveals Thor's personal history from Asgard and prior to the events of The Ultimates. Eons ago, Thor resided in Asgard along with his brothers Balder and Loki, and under the rule of King Odin. Odin foresees that Asgard will soon fall and chooses Thor to champion the ways of Asgard after that event. The hammer Mjolnir is crafted to contain the power of Asgard, and Thor is the only one who is able to wield the weapon. After murdering Balder and stealing the sacred Norn Stones, Loki relocates to Earth. There, he aligns himself with the Nazis in World War 2 in the guise of Baron Zemo. Loki uses the stones to return to Asgard, armed with an army of Frost Giants and Nazi soldiers. In the ensuing battle, Odin transports Loki to the Room with No Doors, but is subsequently killed by a Frost Giant named Mammoth. While Asgard dematerializes, Thor delivers one last powerful blow against the invaders.\n\nIn modern-day Earth, Thor is shown to be the subject of the European Super Soldier program. His powers are shown to be a function of the program, designed by the E.S.S. to imitate Norse iconography with Thor as the super-soldier symbol of Norway, but the project meets an unexpected stumbling block when Thor's claims of being the human incarnation of a Norse God leads the scientists in charge of the program to believe that he is insane. Psychiatrist Dr. Donald Blake is later revealed to be the reborn Balder and tells the scientists that his examination suggests that Thor is who he says he is. Balder tells Thor that, despite Ragnarok destroying Asgard, the Gods live on in the hearts of mortals and are yet to be reawakened. This, in addition to the financial costs that went into the super soldier program, convinces the scientists to complete the work that turns Thor into a super soldier. He is given a suit designed to heighten his strength significantly, leaving him practically unbeatable, along with being equipped with a weather-manipulation device which allows him to control weather and teleport across space. When the scientist face difficulty in handling the size of the machine, Thor tells them to make it the head of his new ax-hammer.\n\nOnce allowed into the open, Thor works on a number of humanitarian projects, and rejects offers from General Nick Fury to join the Ultimates. Meanwhile, Loki escapes from the Room with No Doors and returns to Earth. Balder convinces Thor to take up his responsibility as a hero as Thor joins the Ultimates in subduing the Hulk. Despite his pacifist ideals, Thor promises to \"bring the Thunder\" against \"men who make war\".\n\nReed Richards returned to Earth and founded an organization called Children of Tomorrow, a group of evolved humans with the aim of dominating the world, building their base called the Dome. The Dome's interior ages at an accelerated rate compared to the outside world. Over 900 years have passed inside the Dome, so their inhabitants evolved themselves to perfect super-humans. The EUSS attacked the Dome with Captain Britain, Captain Spain and Captain France along with Thor. The heroes were subdued by the enemies and some of them were killed, draining their powers. After examining Thor, Richards, now called the Maker, sent the Children for the source of power of Thor, leading them to Asgard. After killing every Asgardian God, the Children drained the power of Yggdrasil, leaving Thor powerless. After Iron Man rescued Thor, he provided Odinson with an upgraded version of his Super-Soldier armor, with which Thor teleported to the Dome in search of vengeance. There, he rescued Captain Britain, but was defeated by the Children, and the Maker showed himself as Reed Richards, with the condition of deliver that message. Also, a new ability emerged to Thor, being the last Asgardian alive, he apparently \"became\" Valhalla, being able to see the ghost of the dead Asgardians, such as Odin, Loki, and others, who apparently also acts as his awareness, helping him. Following these events, Thor moved into Stark Tower with Jane Foster. Thor was present with Stark when the Ultimates were labelled as outlaws accompanied him when Stark detailed his plans of how to defeat Reed Richards to the new President of the United States. He easily defeated the Hulk, who was brainwashed by the Maker and injected with a Giant-Man serum.\n\nThor later battles his son, Modi, who has tried to conquer the United States with the help of Hydra. Thor is forced to kill Modi, and is left to mourn his son, as well as rue his own failures as a father.\n\nWhen Reed Richards and his Dark Ultimates destroy the Triskellion, Thor leaves to drown his sorrows at a small bar in Arizona. Bruce Banner tracks Thor down and transforms into the Hulk, leading to a rematch between the two. Thor is defeated and imprisoned, but is later freed alongside the rest of his teammates. Iron Man also creates a new hammer and suit of armor for Thor by using Reed's future technology.\n\nWhen the Earth-616 version of Galactus attacks the Ultimate Earth, Thor is among those to challenge the entity. During the final battle, Thor sacrifices himself in order to drive Galactus into the Negative Zone, trapping them both.\n\nAfter the destruction of both the Earth-616 and Ultimate universes, Thor is among those rescued by God Doom and transported to Battleworld. Now known as Thunderer Thorlief (nicknamed \"Ultimate Thor\"), he begins investigating the murderers of various men and women who all turn out to be alternate universe versions of Donald Blake and Jane Foster. Ultimate Thor discovers that the murders were committed by Rune Thor, who had been tasked by God Doom with eliminating the various versions of Donald and Jane in order to keep the Thor Corps from remembering that the Multiverse once existed before Battleworld. Ultimate Thor and the other members of the Thor Corps storm Doom's castle, where they are all killed.\n\nAfter his death, Ultimate Thor's hammer is shown to have landed on the Earth-616 version of Asgard.\n\nSometime later, the hammer is shown to be on a mysterious space ship, in front of an imprisoned Thor Odinson. This is later revealed to be the ship of the Collector who wants to possess the hammer for himself, and has obtained the ruins of Asgard to this end. Currently, the Collector is being challenged for possession of this hammer by Thanos' Black Order, as well as a team-up of Odinson, Toothgnasher (one of his magical goats), \"Thori\" (a Hellhound previously owned by Loki), and Beta Ray Bill. Although able to channel its power when in proximity, Odinson chooses not to claim the hammer, but he and Bill use the power of the hammer to return Asgard to its rightful place while decimating the Collector's forces. \n\nThis hammer is subsequently claimed by Volstagg, after he witnesses the brutal demise of several children in a conflict with Surtur's forces. This transforms Volstagg into the War Thor. Later, the hammer gets destroyed in a battle with the Mangog.\n\nThis hammer is also seen in one alternate future wielded by synthezoid Victor Mancha.\n\nThor possesses immense superhuman strength, stamina, and durability. At the beginning of the series, his physical powers were entirely dependent on his belt because he had no access to his divine powers. After being restored by Odin, however, it is unclear if the belt boosts his powers or, in fact, serves any purpose at all.\n\nThor possesses the ability to control the weather on a large scale. He is capable of summoning thunderstorms and controlling massive amounts of lightning. He can teleport across space and between dimensions. It is unknown to what extent he relies on his weapons for these abilities. It is also unknown if Thor can control other types of weather. Both variations of his hammer are capable of these powers.\n\nThor possesses some skill at combat. He is depicted with an armory of weapons ranging from different types of hammers to swords and daggers. However, the ax/hammer hybrid primarily wielded by the character is considered to be the \"Ultimate\" version of Mjolnir, as revealed in \"Ultimate Power\" #9. But, in the \"\" miniseries it is revealed that the hammer resembling the Earth-616 version was his weapon when he was a god, and was lost during Ragnarok. When he is reincarnated as Thorleif Golmen, he is given tech-based armour and a portable power supply that gives him his superhuman powers, which is turned into the recognisable axe-hammer from \"The Ultimates\".\n\nStarting in \"The Ultimates 3\", Thor no longer wears the belt or uses the axe-hammer, and instead uses the \"true\" Mjolnir. When the Children of Tomorrow drain the Odinforce and exterminate the Asgardian race, Thor is stripped of his godly powers and gives his square hammer to his son Modi before pushing him into the World Tree. From then, he uses the belt and axe-hammer he wielded before, now more powerful due to advancements made by Tony Stark.\n\nEven after Thor's 'death' after the Incursions, his hammer survived the destruction of the multiverse and landed on Asgard. When the currently-unworthy Odinson of Earth-616 came in close proximity of it, he experienced brief flashes of Ultimate Thor's life, even sensing that the hammer was in some way searching for its true master, and was able to channel the hammer's control of the lightning despite not being its master or worthy of his own hammer at this point.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "80586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80586", "title": "Thyestes", "text": "Thyestes\n\nIn Greek mythology, Thyestes (pronounced , , ) was a king of Olympia. Thyestes and his brother, Atreus, were exiled by their father for having murdered their half-brother, Chrysippus, in their desire for the throne of Olympia. They took refuge in Mycenae, where they ascended the throne upon the absence of King Eurystheus, who was fighting the Heracleidae. Eurystheus had meant for their lordship to be temporary; it became permanent because of his death in conflict. \n\nThe most popular representation of Thyestes is that of the play \"Thyestes\" by Seneca in 62 AD. This play is one of the originals for the revenge tragedy genre. Although inspired by Greek mythology and legend, Seneca's version is different.\n\nThyestes was the son of Pelops and Hippodamia, and father of Pelopia and Aegisthus. His three sons by a naiad who was killed by Atreus were named Aglaus, Orchomenus and Calaeus.\n\nPelops and Hippodamia are parents to Thyestes. However, they were cursed by Myrtilus, a servant of King Oenomaus, the father of Hippodamia. Myrtilus was promised the right to Hippodamia's virginity and half of Pelops' kingdom, but Pelops denied both to him and killed him by throwing him into the sea. With his dying gasp, Myrtilus cursed their line, which is where Thyestes and Atreus comes in.\n\nThyestes' brother and King of Mycenae, Atreus, vowed to sacrifice his best lamb to Artemis. Upon searching his flock, however, Atreus discovered a golden lamb which he gave to his wife, Aerope, to hide from the goddess. She gave it to her lover, Thyestes, who then convinced Atreus to agree that whoever had the lamb should be king. Thyestes produced the lamb and claimed the throne.\n\nAtreus retook the throne using advice he received from Hermes. Thyestes agreed to give the kingdom back when the sun moved backwards in the sky, a feat that Zeus accomplished. Atreus retook the throne and banished Thyestes.\n\nAtreus then learned of Thyestes' and Aerope's adultery and plotted revenge. He killed Thyestes' sons and cooked them, save their hands and heads. He served Thyestes his own sons and then taunted him with their hands and heads. This is the source of modern phrase \"Thyestean Feast,\" or one at which human flesh is served. When Thyestes was done with his feast, he released a loud belch, which represents satiety and pleasure and his loss of self-control.\n\nAn oracle then advised Thyestes that, if he had a son with his own daughter Pelopia, that son would kill Atreus. Thyestes did so by raping Pelopia (his identity hidden from her) and the son, Aegisthus, did kill Atreus. However, when Aegisthus was first born, he was abandoned by his mother, ashamed of the origin of her son. A shepherd found the infant Aegisthus and gave him to Atreus, who raised him as his own son. Only as he entered adulthood did Thyestes reveal the truth to Aegisthus, that he was both father and grandfather to the boy and that Atreus was his uncle. Aegisthus then killed Atreus.\n\nWhile Thyestes ruled Mycenae, the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus, were exiled to Sparta. There, King Tyndareus accepted them as the royalty that they were. Shortly after, he helped the brothers return to Mycenae to overthrow Thyestes, forcing him to live in Cytheria, where he died.\n\nAs a token of good will and allegiance, King Tyndareus offered his daughters to Agamemnon and Menelaus as wives, Clytemnestra and Helen respectively.\n\nWhen Agamemnon left Mycenae for the Trojan War, Aegisthus seduced Agamemnon's wife, Clytemnestra, and the couple plotted to kill her husband upon his return. They succeeded, killing Agamemnon and his new concubine, Cassandra. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus had three children: Aletes, Erigone, and Helen who died as an infant.\n\nSeven or eight years after the death of Agamemnon, Agamemnon's son Orestes returned to Mycenae and, with the help of his cousin Pylades and his sister Electra, killed both their mother, Clytemnestra, and Aegisthus.\n\nTired of the bloodshed, the gods exonerated Orestes and declared this the end of the curse on the house of Atreus, as described in Aeschylus' play \"The Eumenides\".\n\nHowever, other stories say that when Aletes and Erigone came of age and became rulers at Mycenae, Orestes returned with an army then killed his half-brother and raped his half-sister, who gave birth to a son, Penthilus.\n\nIn the first century AD, Seneca the Younger wrote a tragedy called \"Thyestes\". In 1560 Jasper Heywood, then a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, published a verse translation. Shakespeare's tragedy \"Titus Andronicus\" derives some of its plot elements from the story of Thyestes. In 1681, John Crowne wrote \"Thyestes, A Tragedy\", based closely on Seneca's Thyestes, but with the incongruous addition of a love story. Prosper Jolyot Crebillon (1674-1762) wrote a tragedy \"Atree et Thyeste\" (1707), which is prominent in two tales of ratiocination by Edgar Allan Poe. In 1796, Ugo Foscolo (1778–1827) wrote a tragedy called \"Tieste\" that was first presented in Venice one year later. Caryl Churchill, a British dramatist, also wrote a rendition of \"Thyestes.\" Churchill's specific translation was performed at the Royal Court Theater Upstairs in London on June 7, 1994 In 2004, Jan van Vlijmen (1935–2004) completed his opera \"Thyeste\". The libretto was a text in French by Hugo Claus, based on his 20th century play with the same title (in Dutch: \"Thyestes\"). Thyestes appears in Ford Ainsworth's one-act play, \"Persephone\".\n\nSeneca's influence in literature is reflected through other works. In Arnold's Sonnet on Shakespeare, the influence of Seneca is apparent. \"The reminiscence of Atreus’ speech in the \"Thyestes\" of Seneca, which might subtend Cleopatra's own passionate, distended rhetoric about Antony\" (Edgecombe, 257).\n"}

He attended the Philadelphia Museum College of Art, studying Furniture Design. While attending, he won a role in a touring company production of \"The Trojan Women\". He later attended New York University and the Herbert Berghof Studio, where he studied acting. He supported himself by working as a carpenter for several years.\n\nNichols' first feature film role was probably in the gay adult film \"Boynapped!\" (1975). He subsequently appeared mostly in straight porn films shot in New York, such as \"Barbara Broadcast\", \"Blonde Ambition\", \"Jail Bait,\" \"Maraschino Cherry\", \"Punk Rock,\" \"Summer of Laura\", \"Take Off\", and \"Teenage Pajama Party.\" Posa was credited as Wade Nichols in most of the adult films in which he appeared.\n\nIn 1979, using the name Dennis Parker, he recorded a disco album on Casablanca Records entitled \"Like an Eagle\". The album was produced by Village People creator and producer Jacques Morali who was Nichols' boyfriend at the time. He also toured Europe to promote the album. He later appeared in the French film \"Monique\" that same year, with \"Like an Eagle\" being used as its theme song. The title track was released as a single and appears on the box set \"The Casablanca Records Story\" (1994).\n\nPosa (still as Dennis Parker) joined the cast of the soap opera \"The Edge of Night\" in 1979, as Police Chief Derek Mallory.\n\nSeriously ill by October 1984, Posa was unable to continue working on \"The Edge of Night\", and his character was written out of the show. The show was cancelled months later.\n\nParker died January 28, 1985. In a tribute to Parker in a 1985 issue of \"Soap Opera Digest\", fellow \"Edge of Night\" actor Ernie Townsend wrote, \"He died in early January after a long and painful illness that took away a talent in its prime.\" An obituary released in Virginia stated that he died after a \"brief illness, survived by his mother, brother, and partner.\"\n\n"}
