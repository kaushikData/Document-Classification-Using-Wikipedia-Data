Having joined the Bolsheviks in 1916, she is recognized as the first Korean communist.\n\nKim Aerim was born in Sinelnikovo, a Korean village in Siberia. At the time, the area was a hotbed of Korean nationalism. In 1869, her father, Kim Du Suh, had emigrated to Russia, adopting the name Piotr Kim and converting to Orthodox Christianity. He worked as a translator. Later he went to Manchuria to work as an interpreter on the railway. In 1895, Alexandra joined him in China. Soon after her arrival in China, Kim Du Suh died. Alexandra was adopted by Jozef Stankevich, a Russian friend of her father. She attended a girls school in Vladivostok, Siberia. After finishing her education, she began working as a teacher in a primary school. She got married to Stankevich's son.\n\nKim gave up teaching and moved back to Vladivostok, where she took part in political activities for the cause of Korean migrants.\n\nHer marriage did not last long. She divorced her husband and shifted to the Urals region. In the Urals she began political activism. In 1916, she joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). In 1917, Lenin sent her back to Siberia to mobilize Koreans there against the counter-revolutionary forces and the Allied Expeditionary Forces.\n\nIn Khabarovsk she was in charge of external affairs at the Far-Eastern Department of the Party. There she met with Yi Dong-Wi, Kim Rip and other Korean independence fighters. Together they founded the Korean Socialist Party in Khabarovsk on April 28, 1918.\n\nKim was captured, along with many other Korean communists, by White forces and Japanese troops on September 4, 1918. She was executed on September 16, 1918. Reportedly, her last words were \"Freedom and Independence for Korea!\"\n\n"}
{"id": "27407875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27407875", "title": "Anton Geiser", "text": "Anton Geiser\n\nAnton Geiser (surname also spelled Geisser; October 17, 1924 – December 26, 2012) was a Yugoslav-born member of the SS-Totenkopfverbände during World War II, who served as a guard at both the Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps. In 1956 he moved to the United States, settling in Sharon, Pennsylvania, where he had family. In 1962 he became a naturalized American citizen. In 2006 he was stripped of his citizenship on the grounds that it would not have been granted had the full details of his role in the German military been known; in 2010 a US judge ordered him deported to Austria, the country from which he had immigrated. He died in Pittsburgh on December 21, 2012 while still battling his deportation.\n\nGeiser was born in the former Yugoslavia, in the village of Selci Đakovački (part of Đakovo) in eastern Croatia. In September 1942, shortly following the invasion of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany, Geiser, an ethnic German, was drafted into the Waffen SS. He was 17 years old at the time.\n\nOnce in the SS, he was chosen to be a member of the SS-Totenkopfverbände, the so-called \"Death's Head Battalion\" that most concentration camp guards belonged to. He was sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Oranienburg for training, where he was told that as a matter of policy prisoners attempting escape were to be shot. While there, he served as a perimeter guard and escorted prisoners to and from labor sites. Later, he served at the Buchenwald concentration camp in a similar capacity, escorting prisoners to the Arolsen subcamp as necessary and finally aiding with the evacuation of Arolsen's prisoners back to Buchenwald when the subcamp was closed near the war's end.\n\nAfter World War II ended, Geiser lived in Germany for three years before moving to Austria in 1948 to be with his girlfriend, Theresia (1925-2011). He married Theresia in Austria before immigrating to the United States in 1956. After arriving in the United States, Geiser settled in Sharon, Pennsylvania, about 75 miles (120 km) northwest of Pittsburgh, and worked as a steel worker for Sharon Steel Corporation before retiring in 1987, raising three children in the process. He became naturalized as a United States citizen on March 27, 1962.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Geiser was under investigation by the United States government's Office of Special Investigations for his World War II-era activities. Finally, on August 9, 2004, the United States government filed suit to revoke Geiser's citizenship. On September 29, 2006, US District Court Judge David S. Cercone of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ordered the revocation of Geiser's US citizenship, citing Title 8 Chapter 12 § 1451(a) of the US Code, which states that citizenship should be revoked and the certificate of naturalization canceled \"on the ground that such order and certificate of naturalization were illegally procured or were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation\". In support of the illegal procurement claim, he cited \"Fedorenko v. United States\", which specifically established the precedent that voluntary or involuntary assistants of Nazi persecutions were not eligible for US visas, and therefore that the revocation verbiage of the law applies.\n\nGeiser claimed—and the US government did not dispute—that during his career as an SS guard he was never personally directly responsible for the death of an inmate, and that he in fact was friendly with some of them. On these grounds he appealed the decision, arguing that the term \"persecution\" was ambiguous and required clarification, and that in particular it did not apply to him.\n\nThe US 3rd circuit court of appeals heard and rejected this argument in 2008. \"Without Anton Geiser and other members of the SS Death's Head guard battalions, the Nazi concentration camp system could not have accomplished its diabolical objectives,\" said Eli M. Rosenbaum, Director of Human Rights Enforcement Strategy and Policy in the Human Rights and Special Prosecution Section (HRSP), echoing the court's opinion: \"As an armed concentration camp guard in World War II, Geiser 'personally advocated or assisted in the persecution of a group of persons because of race, religion, or national origin.' RRA [Refugee Relief Act of 1953] § 14(a). Therefore, we will affirm the District Court's order granting the Government's motion for summary judgment and revoking Geiser's citizenship.\" The United States Supreme Court declined to hear Geiser's appeal in January 2009.\n\nAfter Geiser exhausted his denaturalization appeals, the US government initiated deportation proceedings against him on April 1, 2009. A year later, on May 18, 2010, a US immigration judge ordered Geiser deported to Austria, the country from which he had immigrated. This order was not carried out, pending an appeal by Geiser, and he continued to reside in the United States. On December 6, 2012, Geiser's appeal was heard by the Board of Immigration Appeals, but Geiser himself did not attend the hearing, having been hospitalized with a broken leg sustained in a fall. Geiser died on December 21 before the BIA could issue a ruling on his appeal.\n"}
{"id": "20201538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20201538", "title": "Bill Dauterive", "text": "Bill Dauterive\n\nBill Dauterive (born William Fontaine de La Tour Dauterive, otherwise known as French for \"William Fountain of the Tower of the High Bank\"; June 22, 1957) is a fictional character on the Fox animated series \"King of the Hill\". He is the Hills' overweight, divorced, and clinically depressed neighbor, voiced by Stephen Root and named for series producer Jim Dauterive.\n\nStephen Root used his background in Southern theater to help him develop the voice of Bill. Root attended the University of Florida, and had performed in Southern plays in New York City prior to being chosen for the role. He originally auditioned for the role of Dale Gribble, which \"didn't feel right\" so he then auditioned for Bill.\n\nBill is indicated as coming from an upper-class Cajun family in Louisiana (the family lived on a vast estate called the Chateau D'Haute Rive (\"castle on the high bank\") until his cousin Gilbert was forced to sell it). He speaks fluent Cajun French and plays the accordion skillfully, which surprises him just as much as it does everyone else. His father was abusive, spanking him regularly, locking him in a rabbit hutch and making him wear dresses (Bill attempts to justify these actions when he mentions them), As of the season 2 episode \"The Final Shinsult,\" Bill's father is presumably still alive (though slowing down in his later years), based upon Bill's remark to Hank that his father \"can't even load a hunting rifle anymore,\" with Bill further commenting that he has to \"practically put it in his hands and pull the trigger.\" By the time of the season 4 episode \"A Beer Can Named Desire,\" Bill's only living male relative is his dandified cousin Gilbert, who still lives in Louisiana. By season 11, the two are guardians of the family's secret barbecue sauce recipe, which Gilbert refuses to allow Bill to sell. (However, Bill eventually gives the recipe to Bobby Hill so he can pass it on to his children, thus keeping the Dauterive tradition alive). Though Bill says he never had any children of his own, there is an opened possibility of him getting one or both of his dead cousins' widows pregnant during his stay at the family mansion while Hank was trying to win money by throwing a football into a big Alamo beer can at the New Orleans Superdome during halftime of the Cowboys-Saints game.\n\nAlthough overweight, balding, and emotionally needy in his later years, Bill was a muscular, confident athlete with long flowing hair in his youth. Nicknamed \"The Billdozer\", he held Arlen High's career touchdown record until a young athlete named Ricky Suggs broke it years later. Ricky, however, is simply allowed to score the record-breaking touchdown by the other team due to a torn ACL, rather than playing injured as Bill would have; to regain his honor Bill rejoins the team to score one last touchdown and re-tie the record (he had redshirt eligibility due to joining the Army during his senior year). Bill's bright future was derailed when he attended a Molly Hatchet concert and found his future wife Lenore passed out in his lap in 1991; she would go on to cheat on and humiliate Bill before finally leaving him a broken shell of his former self. Although there appear to be several factors, it can generally be assumed that her leaving him was the major cause of his downward spiral. In the episode \"Order of the Straight Arrow,\" Bill says \"I'm so depressed, I can't even blink\", upon the reminiscence of his childhood days as an Arrow Scout and remembering his wishes to be a free spirited pilot like his father. Bill's negative self-concept is clearly displayed in the episode \"A Firefighting We Will Go\"; Bill, Dale, Hank, and Boomhauer recall an evening's events, and, while the other three characters imagine themselves in a positive light, Bill imagines himself as being balder, fatter, and more of a glutton than he is in reality. Despite all of this, Bill is loyal and brave in the face of adversity, rescuing the Hills from their house after smelling a gas leak and resuscitating both Peggy and Hank on their front lawn afterwards.\n\nBill is often a foil for his friends, who verbally and emotionally put him down on a regular basis, either because they don't realize how hurtful their remarks are or because Bill is too dimwitted to mind very much. He is the first person to be mentioned when any character refers to losers or bemoans a misfortune for fear their lives will be ruined, like his. For example, Hank, while telling Peggy that a lawn makes a man and gives him a purpose, says \"Without my lawn, I am Bill,\" which disgusts Peggy as the thought of being with Bill nauseates her to no end. Bill, like Dale Gribble and Jeff Boomhauer, has a strong admiration for Hank and often seeks his advice before doing anything, and for his help when in trouble. He occasionally gets dragged into Dale's crazy schemes, and often is the one who accidentally ruins them. Of all his acquaintances, Boomhauer seems to be the one who gives him the most respect, possibly because Bill once helped a brokenhearted Boomhauer get over a girl who dumped him. Dale is the one who seems to disrespect him the most, often insulting his misfortune and lifestyle. Bill has an obsessive crush on Peggy, and frequently makes bumbling, inappropriate remarks about her. Although Bill always speaks highly of Peggy and looks to her as the epitome of desire, she looks at him in total contrast—speaking of him as absolute zero.\n\nAlthough Bill's friends are often disgusted or frustrated at his stupidity and the number of times he has wrecked their plans, they were devastated when it appeared that he had sacrificed himself to save them when they were stuck on a military target zone, with Hank saying that he was a good friend – sweet, loyal, and brave. During their high school years as they have one last blowout in Bill's honor as he's being shipped off a drunken Hank stirs up a fight with a thug at a bar, but Bill intervenes and saves Hank. On some occasions, Bill will fight back, and relentlessly, if pushed enough; upon the words of a fraudulent and condescending doctor who would sarcastically and falsely told him he would lose his legs from diabetes shortly after his diagnosis, and had toyed with Bill's social life and the friends he made along the way, he would exact a beating on him, alongside Hank.\n\nWhen examining Bill's Army medical history, Dale discovered that Bill was unknowingly made part in an experiment called \"Operation: Infinite Walrus\", to create a hybrid soldier capable of operating in freezing cold waters. It is assumed that the experimental drugs are the cause of his weight gain, excessive body hair, baldness, and terrible body odor and breath until it's revealed that he was in the control group given a placebo. Bill is also shown to have a severe but easily treatable foot fungus, which actually comes in handy once to help Hank get revenge on a fraudulent mold inspector. Bill was diagnosed with diabetes and was told he would lose his ability to walk, but then later this was contradicted by the inept diagnosing doctor, who says that he only said Bill was \"likely\" to lose his ability to walk from diabetes. Originally the doctor made it seem like Bill would ultimately need to use a wheelchair. (Later, Bill beats him up for this, with Hank standing guard.) Ironically, this \"diagnosis\" leads Bill to a depressed slump, where he meets Thunder, a wheelchair-using muscle man who plays a wheelchair-friendly version of Rugby. This then leads Bill to get into better shape while playing the sport and this \"cured\" his diabetes.\n\nBill's personal hygiene and other habits are shown to be very poor. As previously mentioned he has severe foot fungus, terrible breath and body odor (when opening the hatch of a tank Bill had stolen, Hank believed there was a dead animal inside due to the smell). Various comments indicate that he doesn't shower or brush his teeth on a regular basis. Bobby states that he has dandruff in spite of being bald. He is regularly shown eating food he finds in or under his couch, and has even been shown to eat food without dishes (as in one episode where he was cooking himself spaghetti, where he broke his only plate and was forced to eat the spaghetti off of his counter and drink the jar of sauce he was going to serve with it). He dumps garbage directly out his kitchen window despite having a garbage can. He has been shown to fall asleep while eating snacks, which attracts animals into his bedroom, though he seems incredulous or apathetic to this. His bathroom is described as disgusting, when asked if they would rather endure a dangerous and painful stunt (ex. stick a wasp up your nose) or shower in Bill's bathroom, his friends always choose the former. When assigned tasks to get his house ready for a family reunion after Nancy and Peggy are assigned the bathroom, both are horrified and desperately try to change assignments. He also has a foot fetish, finding Peggy's unnaturally over-sized feet very appealing, and even tries to take her discarded full-body cast as she convalesces following a disastrous skydive.\n\nBill is also portrayed as being the poorest of Hank's friends. However, he resides in a similar looking house as all the other members of the main cast (one episode reveals he won it in his divorce). Moreover, although Bill is portrayed as poor he is often seen spending money on extravagant, or needless items. This is likely because he generally does not date nor has any family leaving him with extra income. Moreover, while Dale and Nancy can not afford a plastic surgery in the episode Trouble With The Gribbles Bill offers to pay for it himself, signifying that he may be wealthier then the Gribble family.\n\nDespite being physically out of shape, a target of many pranks, and incompetent in many areas Bill is shown to be a great barber at his local army base, so much so that when in episode \"Hank's Bad Hair Day\", when the army eliminates barbers,\nthe base commander makes sure to keep Bill as the base's barber, making him perhaps the only military barber remaining in the army.\n\nBill Dauterive is overweight and balding, and often falls victim to Dale's harassment. Possibly because of low self-esteem and depression, Bill does not regularly brush his teeth, shower, or exercise, only doing these things when dating a woman. When introducing himself to a lawnmower focus group in \"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\", he states that he is 5 ft. 8 in. (173 cm). Although currently overweight Bill is shown to be in incredible shape when first joining the army and when met by old friends they are generally surprised to see how out of shape he became. He is depicted as not meeting the Army's Physical Fitness Standards, however he manages to pass by accidents such as the instructor failing to score him and not wanting to redo the test, or injuring himself prior to the test. In the episode \"Tankin' to the Streets\", Dale suggests that Bill's weight problems stem from a military program designed to create walrus like soldiers to fight the Russians in the Arctic, however Bill was a member of the placebo group. The likely source of his weight problems comes from depression due to his wife leaving him.\n\nDespite being the most overweight out of the show's main characters Bill does on occasion show glimpses of the athleticism he once possessed. In the episode \"Bills are Made to be Broken\", Bill is allowed to return to high school to regain his touchdown record because he never graduated and manages to score despite the best efforts of the defense. Also in the episode \"Bulk and the Body Buddies\", Bill is shown to be able to bulk up and gain muscle relatively fast when he allows a group of muscle builders to work out in his garage. Although Bill is typically easily bullied by his friends, the times he does decide to stand up to himself people generally back away from him suggesting he is physically intimidating despite being overweight, while Dale routinely threatens individuals to no effect due to his small stature.\n\nBill is also shown as being very tough, while Dale trembles at even the thought of pain, Bill is typically shown working through injuries. In the episode Bill of Sales, he is shown to be a competent sales man and Peggy uses him to win a sales contest, it is shown that Bill works hardest when he is insulted so Peggy continues to push him until he begins to bleed, although Bill continued to work Peggy fired him so that he could get better.\n\nBill Dauterive's ex-wife was named Lenore, who was seen and voiced in the episode \"Hank and the Great Glass Elevator\", attempting to worm her way back into Bill's life when he became high profile while dating former Texas governor Ann Richards. During the early seasons, he often pined for Lenore to return after she ran out on him, but he was somewhat successful in getting over her in the episode \"Pretty Pretty Dresses\" after Hank resorts to pretending to be Lenore. Bill then finally symbolically confronts Lenore for leaving him, and after being told \"I don't love you anymore\" he becomes enraged and yells \"You don't deserve William Fontaine dela Tour Dauterive!\". During \"Hank and the Great Glass Elevator\", Lenore tries ordering Bill around in front of Ann Richards but he finally tells her off by mooning her. Other relationships include Luanne's mother Leanne Platter (\"Leanne's Saga\"), which ended when she reverted to her drunken violent ways and stole his truck, and Kahn's mother Laoma Souphanousinphone (\"Maid in Arlen\"), which was broken up by interference from Kahn, who convinced Bill that his mother was in love with astronaut Harrison Schmitt, but they then found out Kahn had been lying because seeing the two of them together disgusted him, and reunited with Kahn grudgingly saying they seemed right together (the show originally intended for Bill and Laoma to remain together, but the writing staff changed that plan and simply wrote her out of the series so Bill could remain hilariously unlucky in love, although their relationship is briefly mentioned in one subsequent episode). He also had a brief, mostly sexual, relationship with two of his cousins' widows (\"A Beer Can Named Desire\"). In the episode \"The Untitled Blake McCormick Project,\" Bill dates a woman named Charlene, and she even moves in with him, however Charlene's past with John Redcorn complicates matters. In a later season, he dated Reverend Karen Stroup for a time and even moved her in with him. When Reverend Stroup and Bill began dating, her congregation showed massive disapproval of their Reverend dating anyone, especially Bill. This meant that they had to carry out their relationship in secret. To Bill, this was exciting. He enjoyed the fact that they were having a relationship that was viewed as immoral by their peers. Unfortunately for Bill, when the pressure became too much for Stroup, she stepped down from her Reverendcy so that they could date like normal people. Bill ultimately broke up with Stroup because he found the relationship was no longer exciting when it was not a secret. Due to his ability to keep going after virtually any rejection, Bill is the one able to snap Boomhauer out of his depression when rejected by a woman he truly had feelings for.\n\nPeggy Hill has said and done many cruel things to Bill, both to his face and behind his back with no regards to his feeling. But despite Bill's complete infatuation with Peggy, she seems to loathe him just as much. She brings him endless heartache, though it's not always intentional. For example, during a game of baseball, she once accidentally threw a bean-ball at his head, knocking him to the ground. She then mistakenly threw another at his crotch, putting him in excruciating pain and humiliation. She stole his prized American flag and accidentally destroyed it, driving him to absolute tears. Another time, angry at his endless pursuit of her, she hit him once at a game, she inadvertently wound up knocking him off the bleachers—his arm later in a sling. She, Dale and Minh studied him to make money for their investing endeavors, but eventually dropped him when he became conscious of it all--deepening his depression. Despite all of this, she says she considers him \"a friend.\"\n\nBill holds the fictional military occupational specialty \"barber\" in the United States Army under Ft. Blanda's H company, 10th infantry. His rank has been revealed through dialogue, in scenes of him wearing obsolete olive drab fatigues as being sergeant, and he appears to wear the insignia of E-5 on his Class A uniform in the episode \"Old Glory\". He has never deployed in his Army career. He briefly served as a recruiter when his position was eliminated for being wasteful, but it was secretly restored when Hank donated a new chair, with a cover job as an electrician. He speaks four to six languages (English, French, and Tagalog for sure), of which he used at least four in the army. It is revealed in one episode that as an athletic young man entering the army, he wanted to serve in the armored cavalry in a tank crew. He also was briefly a professional hair stylist with Luanne at the trendy salon Hottyz until it was discovered he wasn't homosexual. Bill and Luanne eventually worked for Hank's barber, Jack, which brought in a young adult clientele and saved Jack from going out of business.\n\nSeveral times throughout the series Bill is revealed to be very talented at cutting hair. When Hank receives a bad hair cut, Bill is able to fix it quite easily. He revealed to Hank that he dyed the hair of 53 officers who serve at Ft. Blanda. When given other military duties such as recruiting, he has no success. While working at Hottyz, a high style salon, Bill and Luanne pitch together to host a chair. Luanne increases her sex appeal and Bill pretends to be gay so he won't offend women. They quickly rise to become \"first chair.\" On another episode, it is revealed that the General of the base at won't allow anyone besides Bill cut his hair. \n\nWhen he is engaged by other pursuits, such as when he toured with a choir group called the Harmonoholics or when he decided to run his own halfway house, Bill uses up all his personal and sick days from the army almost to the point of going AWOL; otherwise he doesn't use them at all. He is described as being nice but often depressed and lonely; his overwhelming need to make people like him makes him easily taken advantage of, particularly by Dale. He is overwhelmingly patriotic. When an American Flag is due to be disposed of by burning (as is principal practice), he offers to take the flag and hoist it over his home. When Kahn dares to so much as attempt to lower the flag, Bill lunges at Kahn fiercely. When the flag is destroyed, Bill cries terribly. \n\nIn the episode \"Bill of Sales\" it is also suggested that Bill has emotionally masochistic tendencies—explaining his lust for Peggy. No one finds Bill more repellent than she does—and everyone finds Bill very repellent. After learning this, Peggy's attempt to, in her words, \"'motivate' him, business term, with a little 'praise', my term, he goes plumb loco, Spanish term.\" Hank's response, \"You must have confused him; being dumped on is all Bill knows\" leads Peggy to conclude that \"Bill has had a hard life and he likes it that way\" and subsequently refers to him as a \"nut job\". She manages to persuade him to go back to work for her by verbally abusing him. However, she soon fires him out of feelings of guilt for taking advantage of his low self-esteem. It's also during this episode that Bill shows exceptional skills as a salesman, helping Peggy achieve her sales quotas quickly. However, it could be seen as Bill didn't want to betray Hank (afraid that Peggy was coming onto him), and the reason for going back to help Peggy was fear she didn't want to even talk to him anymore.\n\nAccording to \"Drawn to Television\" by M. Keith Booker, Bill \"is a lonely figure who adds a touch of pathos to the humor of King of the Hill, which is often bittersweet.\" Jim Bawden of the Toronto Star describes Bill as a \"sad sack\". Voicing Bill and a couple other characters on the show is Stephen Root's favorite job.\n"}

He studied at a local school established by his father, continued his secondary education in Shusha and then Vladikavkaz completing it in 1909. He was then admitted to Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University to study mount-mining. While a student, he lost his father and had to work around the clock to be able to support himself. In 1916, he graduated from the university with a specialty in Metallurgy Engineering and got a job at \"Ayvaz\" plant. Involved in public protests after Russia's February Revolution, he took a part in the gathering to meet Vladimir Lenin returning from Finland at Saint Peterburg railway station on April 3, 1917. Impressed by his speech, Ildyrym decided to commit himself to the communist movement.\n\nHaving joined the ranks of the Bolsheviks, Ildyrym proposed to create Muslim Labor Red Army, then called \"Ildyrymmiye\", which would defend the Bolshevik governments in regions of Azerbaijan. The first Ildyrymmiye was established in June 1918 in Petrograd and Simal. The same year, Ildyrymmiye army of 2,000 Azerbaijanis fought against the White Army in Astrakhan during the Russian Civil War but due to involvement of Armenian Dashnaks siding with Bolsheviks in massacres of Azerbaijanis during March Days of 1918, Bolsheviks lost their support among Azerbaijanis and the army soon dissolved. In 1919, he returned to Shusha and continued propagating communism. During the existence of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, Ildyrym served as Deputy Commander of Azerbaijani Navy and chief of the harbor under Musavat's leadership although he was a Bolshevik. In 1919, he established a special navy expedition to handle transportation of oil to Russia.\n\nOn April 27, when the 11th Red Army was invading Baku, Ildyrym played an important role in overthrowing the ADR government. With a number of soldiers, he entered Baku Navy school and disarmed the cadets. Later in the day, he captured positions in Bailov, completely taking over the shipyard. All prisoners held in Bailov prison were let free, among them well known revolutionaries Rahim Huseynov, Dadash Bunyadzade and Gasim Ismayilov. Once the center of Baku was taken, the Bolsheviks led by Ildyrym surrounded the National Assembly of Azerbaijan with artillery and presented an ultimatum to Musavat government. On early morning hours of April 28, 1920, after debates in the parliament, the government agreed to terms of the Bolsheviks and ADR ceased to exit. With the establishment of Communist regime in Azerbaijan, Chingiz Ildyrym was appointed the first People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs of Azerbaijan.\n\nIn 1924, Ildyrym worked as Commissar of Public Roads and presented innovative ideas for road construction in Azerbaijan later applied elsewhere in USSR. He built the first electrified railway in the USSR on the Baku-Sabunchi route. The construction of the Baku-Julfa railway, stretching 407 km in 1924, was his best and most well known project.\n\nIn 1924-1928, Ildyrym worked as Deputy Chairman of Supreme Agricultural Council. During his term in the entity, he started electrification policies in Azerbaijan. As a result, 19 electric stations (1500 hp) were built in 1924-1927. This stimulated increase in manufacturing abilities of Azerbaijan and in 1927, steel manufacturing department was established at Lieutenant Schmidt (presently Sattarkhan) Plant. In 1925, 65% of the drilling equipment for Azerbaijani oil fields were switched to electric power. \n\nIn 1929, Ildyrym was appointed project manager for construction of Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works and from 1934, he was managing construction of one of centers of Soviet metallurgy, Krivoy Rog. During the time of construction boom, Ildyrym was sent to the United States to arrange shipments of necessary materials for construction of the plant in Magnitogorsk.\n\nOn July 7, 1937, Ildyrym was arrested by NKVD and charged with an alleged anti-revolutionary plot. He was held prisoner in Dnepropetrovsk, Baku and Moscow. In Moscow, he was first jailed in high security Lefortovo Prison and then moved to a more severe location - Sukhanovka, infamous for political prisoners. He was sentenced to death by NKVD and his family was notified he had been sentenced to 10 years without permission to communicate with the outside world. He was executed by firing squad in the summer of 1937.\n\n"}

He grew up in Burnham-on-Sea. He went to Christ's Hospital and for one year studied chemistry at the University of York before leaving for a stay in Canada. Returning to Britain, he joined the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where he served as photographer and picture editor for a student magazine. After graduating in psychology in 1970 he started to work as a freelance photographer, specializing in the theatre, while he also lectured in psychology.\n\nBy 1971, Steele-Perkins had moved to London and become a full-time photographer, with particular interest in urban issues, including poverty. He went to Bangladesh in 1973 to take photographs for relief organizations; some of this work was exhibited in 1974 at the Camerawork Gallery (London). In 1973–74 he taught photography at the Stanhope Institute and the North East London Polytechnic.\n\nIn 1975, Steele-Perkins joined the Exit Photography Group with the photographers Nicholas Battye and Paul Trevor, and there continued his examination of urban problems: Exit's earlier booklet \"Down Wapping\" had led to a commission by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation to increase the scale of their work, and in six years they produced 30,000 photographs as well as many hours of taped interviews. This led to the 1982 book \"Survival Programmes.\" Steele-Perkins' work included depiction from 1975 to 1977 of street festivals, and prints from \"London Street Festivals\" were bought by the British Council and exhibited with Homer Sykes' \"Once a Year\" and Patrick Ward's \"Wish You Were Here\"; Steele-Perkins' depiction of Notting Hill has been described as being in the vein of Tony Ray-Jones.\n\nSteele-Perkins became an associate of the French agency Viva in 1976, and three years after this, he published his first book, \"The Teds,\" an examination of teddy boys that is now considered a classic of documentary and even fashion photography. He curated photographs for the Arts Council collection, and co-edited a collection of these, \"About 70 Photographs.\"\n\nIn 1977 Steele-Perkins made a short detour into \"conceptual\" photography, working with the photographer Mark Edwards to collect images from the ends of rolls of films taken by themselves and others. These were exposures taken after loading a fresh film and without focusing or aiming. These frames serve to wind the fogged film leader along and to bring unexposed film from the cassette into place for the first exposure. To be sure of having unfogged film in place the photographer winds on a few more frames than are needed and it's these that sometimes showed surprising images. Forty were exhibited in \"Film Ends\".\n\nWork documenting poverty in Britain took Steele-Perkins to Belfast, which he found to be poorer than Glasgow, London, Middlesbrough, or Newcastle, as well as experiencing \"a low-intensity war\". He stayed in the Catholic Lower Falls area, first squatting and then staying in the flat of a man he met in Belfast. His photographs of Northern Ireland appeared in a 1981 book written by Wieland Giebel. Thirty years later, he would return to the area to find that its residents had new problems and fears; the later photographs appear within \"Magnum Ireland.\"\n\nSteele-Perkins photographed wars and disasters in the third world, leaving Viva in 1979 to join Magnum Photos as a nominee (on encouragement by Josef Koudelka), and becoming an associate member in 1981 and a full member in 1983. He continued to work in Britain, taking photographs published as \"The Pleasure Principle,\" an examination (in colour) of life in Britain but also a reflection of himself. With Philip Marlow, he successfully pushed for the opening of a London office for Magnum; the proposal was approved in 1986.\n\nSteele-Perkins made four trips to Afghanistan in the 1990s, sometimes staying with the Taliban, the majority of whom \"were just ordinary guys\" who treated him courteously. Together with James Nachtwey and others, he was also fired on, prompting him to reconsider his priorities: in addition to the danger of the front line:\n\n. . . you never get good pictures out of it. I've yet to see a decent front-line war picture. All the strong stuff is a bit further back, where the emotions are.\n\nA book of his black and white images, \"Afghanistan,\" was published first in French, and later in English and in Japanese. The review in the \"Spectator\" read in part:\n\nThe book and the travelling exhibition of photographs were also reviewed favorably in the \"Guardian, Observer, Library Journal,\" and London \"Evening Standard.\"\n\nSteele-Perkins served as the President of Magnum from 1995 to 1998. One of the annual meetings over which he presided was that of 1996, to which Russell Miller was given unprecedented access as an outsider and which Miller has described in some detail.\n\nWith his second wife the presenter and writer Miyako Yamada (), whom he married in 1999, Steele-Perkins has spent much time in Japan, publishing two books of photographs: \"Fuji,\" a collection of views and glimpses of the mountain inspired by Hokusai's \"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji\"; and \"Tokyo Love Hello,\" scenes of life in the city. Between these two books he also published a personal visual diary of the year 2001, \"Echoes.\"\n\nWork in South Korea included a contribution to a Hayward Gallery touring exhibition of photographs of contemporary slavery, \"Documenting Disposable People\", in which Steele-Perkins interviewed and made black-and-white photographs of Korean \"comfort women\". \"Their eyes were really important to me: I wanted them to look at you, and for you to look at them\", he wrote. \"They're not going to be around that much longer, and it was important to give this show a history.\" The photographs were published within \"Documenting Disposable People: Contemporary Global Slavery.\"\n\nSteele-Perkins returned to England for a project by the Side Gallery on Durham's closed coalfields (exhibited within \"Coalfield Stories\"); after this work ended, he stayed on to work on a depiction (in black and white) of life in the north-east of England, published as \"Northern Exposures.\"\n\nIn 2008 Steele-Perkins won an Arts Council England grant for \"Carers: The Hidden Face of Britain\", a project to interview those caring for their relatives at home, and to photograph the relationships. Some of this work has appeared in \"The Guardian,\" and also in his book \"England, My England,\" a compilation of four decades of his photography that combines photographs taken for publication with much more personal work: he does not see himself as having a separate personality when at home. \"By turns gritty and evocative,\" wrote a reviewer in \"The Guardian,\" \"it is a book one imagines that Orwell would have liked very much.\"\n\nSteele-Perkins has two sons, Cedric, born 16 November 1990, and Cameron, born 18 June 1992. With his marriage to Miyako Yamada he has a stepson, Daisuke and a granddaughter, Momoe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was first published in 1986. The stories' protagonists are two toddler brothers who like to cause double the trouble wherever they go. The artist when the strip first started was Barrie Appleby, who continued until 2004 with a strip by Gordon Bell in the 1994 annual and a sole strip by Nigel Parkinson in 2003, who took over the strip next year as part of the revamp at that time.\n\nCuddles and Dimples actually started out as two separate strips. While Dimples started out in \"The Dandy\" on 27 October 1984, Cuddles had already been in \"Nutty\" since March 1981. When \"Nutty\" merged with \"The Dandy\" in 1985, Cuddles did not follow, instead becoming the cover character of \"Hoot\". \"Hoot\" combined with \"The Dandy\" the following year, and the first \"Cuddles and Dimples\" story showed Cuddles' family moving to Dandytown, where he met Dimples. This took place in issue 2345, dated 1 November 1986. By late 1987, without explanation, one set of parents disappeared (Cuddles'), and the toddlers were said to be twins. Grounds for this change had been somewhat prepared previously by a short-lived spin-off strip called \"That's Our Granny\" which established that the two boys shared a grandmother.\n\nFor many years, the characters appeared in the centre pages (with full colour) of \"The Dandy\". When they first appeared, they appeared in pages 16 and 17 of the then 20-page comic with red and black as the only colours.\n\nThe characters took over the front page of \"The Dandy\" from issue 3008 (July 1999) until October 2000, when they got 'thrown out' for misbehaving too much (in reality, readers wanted Desperate Dan back on the cover). They were both preceded and succeeded on the cover by Desperate Dan.\nBy the time of the revamp in October 2004, Cuddles and Dimples were assigned to Nigel Parkinson to freshen up their look (prior to the new look, the strip had been reprinted since early 2004). Dimples was made the older brother and now has a patch of Brown Hair. He also became vaguely intelligent. Cuddles look was toned down from the grotesque little monster he was before, and was made the younger, more naive and disgusting brother. Both of them appeared slightly less childish; for example, they no longer called their parents \"Mumsie and Daddums\", instead calling them Mum and Dad. Their parents were also revamped, dad being a pot-bellied balding idiot and mum an up-to-date babe or a yummy mummy. The strip was axed with \"The Dandy\"s revamp in October 2010; however, they returned in reprints from February 2012 onwards.\n"}

In reality, he was the fictitious creation of the Austrian art group monochrom.\n\nArt group monochrom was chosen to represent the Republic of Austria at the São Paulo Art Biennial, São Paulo (Brazil) in 2002. However, the political climate in Austria (at that time, the center-right People's Party had recently formed a coalition with Jörg Haider's radical-right Austrian Freedom Party) gave the left-wing art group concerns about acting as wholehearted representatives of their nation. Monochrom dealt with the conundrum by creating the persona of Georg P. Thomann, an irascible, controversial (and completely fictitious) artist of longstanding fame and renown. Through the implementation of this ironic mechanism – even the catalogue included the biography of the non-existent artist – the group solved with pure fiction the philosophical and bureaucratic dilemma attached to the system of representation presented to them by the Biennial.\n\nA further development related to Georg Paul Thomann took place once the São Paulo Art Biennial was underway. The artist Chien-Chi Chang was invited as the representative of Taiwan, but the country's name was removed by the administration from his cube overnight and replaced by the label, \"Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei\". As the members of monochrom discovered, China had threatened to retreat from the Biennial (and create massive diplomatic problems) if the organizers of the Biennial were thought to be challenging the \"One-China policy\". Chang's open letter remained unanswered. Under the guise of Thomann, monochrom invited artists from several countries to show their solidarity with Chang by taking the adhesive letters from their countries' name tags and giving them to Chang so that he could remount \"Taiwan\" outside his room. Monochrom wanted to show that artists do not necessarily have to internalize the fragmentation and isolation imposed by the rat-race of art markets and exhibitions as society-controlling imperatives. Several Asian newspapers reported about the performance. One Taiwanese newspaper headlined: \"Austrian artist Georg Paul Thomann saves 'Taiwan'\".\n\nIn 2005 monochrom released a press info that \"Austrian artist and writer Prof. Georg Paul Thomann died in a tragic accident at the tender age of 60.\" On July 29, 2005 they staged his funeral in Hall in Tirol. Thomann's gravesite remains in Hall.

As a teen, George Jr., known then as \"Ted\", would deliver milk and used his salary to start a newspaper at the high school, where he also played football. His higher education took place at the University of Iowa, where he was a football player, a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and editor of \"The Daily Iowan\", an independent newspaper which serves the university campus. He earned his B.A. in 1923, his M.A. in 1925 and his Ph.D. in 1928.\n\nHe then moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where he served as head of the Department of Journalism at Drake University until 1931. That year, he moved to Evanston, Illinois, as a professor of journalism and advertising at Northwestern University. The next year, he moved to New York City to join the advertising agency of Young and Rubicam as director of research (later as vice president from 1937 to 1947). He was also professor of journalism at Columbia University, but he had to give up this position shortly after he formed his own polling company, the American Institute of Public Opinion (Gallup Poll), in 1935.\n\nGallup is often credited as the developer of public polling. In 1932, Gallup did some polling for his mother-in-law, Ola Babcock Miller, a candidate who was a long-shot from winning a position as Iowa Secretary of State. With the Democratic landslide of that year, she won a stunning victory, furthering Gallup's interest in politics.\n\nIn 1936, his new organization achieved national recognition by correctly predicting, from the replies of only 50,000 respondents, that Franklin Roosevelt would defeat Alf Landon in the U.S. Presidential election. This was in direct contradiction to the widely respected \"Literary Digest\" magazine whose poll based on over two million returned questionnaires predicted that Landon would be the winner. Not only did Gallup get the election right, he correctly predicted the results of the \"Literary Digest\" poll as well using a random sample smaller than theirs but chosen to match it.\n\nTwelve years later, his organization had its moment of greatest ignominy, when it predicted that Thomas Dewey would defeat Harry S. Truman in the 1948 election, by five to fifteen percentage points. Gallup believed the error was mostly due to ending his polling three weeks before Election Day.\n\nIn 1947, he launched the Gallup International Association, an international association of polling organizations.\n\nIn 1948, with Claude E. Robinson, he founded Gallup and Robinson, Inc., an advertising research company.\n\nIn 1958, Gallup grouped all of his polling operations under what became The Gallup Organization.\n\nGallup died in 1984 of a heart attack at his summer home in Tschingel ob Gunten, a village in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland. He was buried in Princeton Cemetery. His wife died in 1988, and their son, writer and pollster George Gallup, Jr., died in 2011.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12804", "title": "Grigori Rasputin", "text": "Grigori Rasputin\n\nGrigori Yefimovich Rasputin (; ;  – ) was a Russian mystic and self-proclaimed holy man who befriended the family of Tsar Nicholas II, the last monarch of Russia, and gained considerable influence in late imperial Russia.\n\nBorn to a peasant family in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye, Tyumen Oblast, Rasputin had a religious conversion experience after taking a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897. He has been described as a monk or as a \"strannik\" (wanderer, or pilgrim), though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church. After traveling to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or the winter of 1904–5, Rasputin captivated some church and social leaders. He became a society figure, and met the Tsar in November 1905.\n\nIn late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a healer for the Tsar and his wife Alexandra's son Alexei, who suffered from hemophilia and was Nicholas' only heir (Tsarevitch). At court, he was a divisive figure, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary, and prophet, and by others as a religious charlatan. The high point of Rasputin's power was in 1915, when Nicholas II left St Petersburg to oversee Russian armies fighting World War I, increasing both Alexandra and Rasputin's influence. As Russian defeats in the war mounted, however, both Rasputin and Alexandra became increasingly unpopular. In the early morning of , Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative noblemen who opposed his influence over Alexandra and the Tsar.\n\nHistorians often suggest that Rasputin's terrible reputation helped discredit the tsarist government, and thus helped precipitate the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty, which happened a few weeks after he was assassinated. Very little about Rasputin's life and influence is certain, however, as accounts have often been based on hearsay, rumor, and legend.\n\nRasputin was born a peasant in the small village of Pokrovskoye, along the Tura River in the Tobolsk Governorate (now Tyumen Oblast) in Siberia. According to official records, he was born on and christened the following day. He was named for St. Gregory of Nyssa, whose feast was celebrated on January 10.\n\nThere are few records of Rasputin's parents. His father, Efim (sometimes spelled Yefim), was a peasant farmer and church elder who had been born in Pokrovskoye in 1842, and married Rasputin's mother, Anna Parshukova, in 1863. Efim also worked as a government courier, ferrying people and goods between Tobolsk and Tyumen The couple had seven other children, all of whom died in infancy and early childhood; there may have been a ninth child, Feodosiya. According to historian Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin was certainly close to Feodosiya and was godfather to her children, but \"the records that have survived do not permit us to say more than that.\"\n\nAccording to historian Douglas Smith, Rasputin's youth and early adulthood are \"a black hole about which we know almost nothing\", though the lack of reliable sources and information did not stop others from fabricating stories about his parents and his youth after Rasputin's rise to fame. Historians agree, however, that like most Siberian peasants, including his mother and father, Rasputin was never formally educated, and he remained illiterate well into his early adulthood. Local archival records suggest that he had a somewhat unruly youth – possibly involving drinking, small thefts, and disrespect for local authorities – but contain no evidence of his being charged with stealing horses, blasphemy, or bearing false witness, all major crimes that he was later rumored to have committed as a young man.\n\nIn 1886, Rasputin travelled to Abalak, where he met a peasant girl named Praskovya Dubrovina. After a courtship of several months, they married in February 1887. Praskovya remained in Pokrovskoye throughout Rasputin's later travels and rise to prominence, and remained devoted to him until his death. The couple had seven children, though only three survived to adulthood: Dmitry (b. 1895), Maria (b. 1898) and Varvara (b. 1900).\n\nIn 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage. His reasons for doing so are unclear: according to some sources, Rasputin left the village to escape punishment for his role in a horse theft. Other sources suggest that he had a vision – either of the Virgin Mary, or of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye – while still others suggest that Rasputin's pilgrimage was inspired by his interactions with a young theological student, Melity Zaborovsky. Whatever his reasons, Rasputin's departure was a radical life change: he was twenty-eight, had been married ten years, and had an infant son with another child on the way. According to Douglas Smith, his decision \"could only have been occasioned by some sort of emotional or spiritual crisis.\"\n\nRasputin had undertaken earlier, shorter pilgrimages to the Holy Znamensky Monastery at Abalak and to Tobolsk's cathedral, but his visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897 was transformative. There, he met and was \"profoundly humbled\" by a \"starets\" (elder) known as Makary. Rasputin may have spent several months at Verkhoturye, and it was perhaps here that he learned to read and write, but he later complained about the monastery itself, claiming that some of the monks engaged in homosexuality and criticizing monastic life as too coercive. He returned to Pokrovskoye a changed man, looking disheveled and behaving differently than he had before. He became a vegetarian, swore off alcohol, and prayed and sang much more fervently than he had in the past.\n\nRasputin would spend the years that followed living as a \"Strannik,\" (a holy wanderer, or pilgrim), leaving Pokrovskoye for months or even years at a time to wander the country and visit a variety of different holy sites. It is possible that Rasputin wandered as far Athos, Greece – the center of Orthodox monastic life – in 1900.\n\nBy the early 1900s, Rasputin had developed a small circle of acolytes, primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days when he was in Pokrovskoye. Building a makeshift chapel in Efim's root cellar – Rasputin was still living within his father's household at the time – the group held secret prayer meetings there. These meetings were the subject of some suspicion and hostility from the village priest and other villagers. It was rumored that female followers were ceremonially washing him before each meeting, that the group sang strange songs that the villagers had not heard before, and even that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a religious sect whose ecstatic rituals were rumored to included self-flagellation and sexual orgies. According to historian Joseph Fuhrmann, however, \"repeated investigations failed to establish that Rasputin was ever a member of the sect,\" and rumors that he was a Khlyst appear to have been unfounded.\n\nWord of Rasputin's activity and charisma began to spread in Siberia during the early 1900s. Sometime between 1902 and 1904, he travelled to the city of Kazan on the Volga river, where he acquired a reputation as a wise and perceptive \"starets,\" or holy man, who could help people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties. Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with some of his female followers, he won over the father superior of the Seven Lakes Monastery outside Kazan, as well as a local church officials Archimandrite Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave him a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, and arranged for him to travel to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or in the winter of 1904–1905.\n\nUpon meeting Sergei at the Nevsky Monastery, Rasputin was introduced to a number of different church leaders, including Archimandrite Feofan, who was the inspector of the theological seminary, was well-connected in St. Petersburg society, and later served as confessor to the Tsar and his wife. Feofan was so impressed with Rasputin that he invited him to stay in his home, and became one of Rasputin's most important and influential friends in St. Petersburg.\n\nAccording to Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin stayed in St. Petersburg for only a few months on his first visit and returned to Prokovskoye in the fall of 1903. Historian Douglas Smith, however, argues that it is impossible to know whether Rasputin stayed in St. Petersburg or returned to Prokovskoye at some point between his first arrival there and 1905. Regardless, by 1905 Rasputin had formed friendships with several members of the aristocracy, including the \"Black Princesses,\" Militsa and Anatasia of Montenegro, who had married the Tsar's cousins (Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich and Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich), and were instrumental in introducing Rasputin to the Tsar and his family.\n\nRasputin first met the Tsar on November 1, 1905, at the Peterhof Palace. The tsar recorded the event in his diary, writing that he and Alexandra had \"made the acquaintance of a man of God – Grigory, from Tobolsk province.\" Rasputin would not meet the Tsar and his wife again for some months: he returned to Prokovskoye shortly after their first meeting and did not return to St. Petersburg until July 1906. On his return, Rasputin sent Nicholas a telegram asking to present the tsar with an icon of Simeon of Verkhoturye. He met with Nicholas and Alexandra on July 18 and again in October, when he first met their children. At some point, the royal family became convinced that Rasputin possessed the power to heal Alexei, but historians disagree over when: according to Orlando Figes, Rasputin was first introduced to the Tsar and Tsarina as a healer who could help their son in November 1905, while Joseph Fuhrmann has speculated that it was in October 1906 that Rasputin was first asked to pray for the health of Alexei.\n\nMuch of Rasputin's influence with the royal family stemmed from the belief by Alexandra and others that he had eased the pain and stopped the bleeding of the Tsarevich – who suffered from hemophilia – on several occasions. According to historian Marc Ferro, the Tsarina had a \"passionate attachment\" to Rasputin as a result of her belief that he could heal her son's affliction. Harold Shukman wrote that Rasputin became \"an indispensable member of the royal entourage\" as a result.\n\nRasputin had been rumored to be capable of faith-healing since his arrival in St. Petersburg, and the Tsarina's friend Anna Vyrubova became convinced that Rasputin had miraculous powers shortly thereafter. Vyrubova would become one of Rasputin's most influential advocates.\n\nIt is unclear when Rasputin first learned of Alexei's hemophilia, or when he first acted as a healer for Alexei. He may have been aware of Alexei's condition as early as October 1906, and was summoned by Alexandra to pray for Alexei when he had an internal hemorrhage in the spring of 1907. Alexei recovered the next morning.\n\nDuring the summer of 1912, Alexei developed a hemorrhage in his thigh and groin after a jolting carriage ride near the royal hunting grounds at Spala, which caused a large hematoma. In severe pain and delirious with fever, the Tsarevich appeared to be close to death. In desperation, the Tsarina asked Vyrubova to send Rasputin (who was in Siberia) a telegram, asking him to pray for Alexei. Rasputin wrote back quickly, telling the Tsarina that \"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.\" The next morning, Alexei's condition was unchanged, but Alexandra was encouraged by the message and regained some hope that Alexei would survive. Alexei's bleeding stopped the following day.\n\nHistorian Robert K. Massie has called Alexei's recovery \"one of the most mysterious episodes of the whole Rasputin legend.\" The cause of his recovery is unclear: Massie speculated that Rasputin's suggestion not to let doctors disturb Alexei had aided his recovery by allowing him to rest and heal, or that his message may have aided Alexei's recovery by calming Alexandra and reducing the emotional stress on Alexei. Alexandra, however, believed that Rasputin had performed a miracle, and concluded that he was essential to Alexei's survival.\n\nSome writers and historians, such as Ferro, have claimed that Rasputin stopped Alexei's bleeding on other occasions through hypnosis.\n\nThe royal familyand especially Alexandra'sbelief that Rasputin possessed the power to heal Alexei brought him considerable status and power at court. The Tsar appointed Rasputin his \"lampadnik,\" or lamplighter, who was charged with keeping the lamps that burned in front of religious icons in the palace lit and thus had regular access to the palace and royal family. By December 1906, Rasputin had become close enough to the royal family to ask a special favor of the Tsar – that he be permitted to change his surname to Rasputin-Novyi (Rasputin-New). Nicholas granted the request and the name change was speedily processed, suggesting that the Tsar viewed – and treated – Rasputin favorably at that time. Rasputin used his status and power to full effect, accepting bribes and sexual favors from admirers and working diligently to expand his influence. He soon became a controversial figure; he was accused by his enemies of religious heresy and rape, was suspected of exerting undue political influence over the tsar, and was even rumored to be having an affair with the Tsarina.\n\nEven before Rasputin's arrival in St. Petersburg in 1903, alternative religious movements such as spiritualism and theosophy had become increasingly popular among the city's aristocracy, and many of them were intensely curious about the occult and the supernatural more generally. While fascinated by him, the Saint Petersburg elite did not widely accept Rasputin. He did not fit in with the royal family, and he and the Russian Orthodox Church had a very strained relationship. The Holy Synod frequently attacked Rasputin, accusing him of a variety of immoral or evil practices. Because Rasputin was a court official, though, he and his apartment were under 24-hour surveillance, and, accordingly, there exists some credible evidence about his lifestyle in the form of the famous \"staircase notes\" – reports from police spies, which were not given only to the Tsar but also published in newspapers.\n\nAccording to Rasputin's daughter, Maria, Rasputin did \"look into\" the Khlysty sect, but rejected it. One Khlyst practice was known as \"rejoicing\" (радение), a ritual which sought to overcome human sexual urges by engaging in group sexual activities so that, in consciously sinning together, the sin's power over the human was nullified. Rasputin is said to have been particularly appalled by the belief that grace is found through self-flagellation.\n\nLike many spiritually minded Russians, Rasputin spoke of salvation as depending less on the clergy and the church than on seeking the spirit of God within. He also maintained that sin and repentance were interdependent and necessary to salvation. Thus, he claimed that yielding to temptation (and, for him personally, this meant sex and alcohol), even for the purposes of humiliation (so as to dispel the sin of vanity), was needed to proceed to repentance and salvation. Rasputin was deeply opposed to war, both from a moral point of view and as something which was likely to lead to political catastrophe. During the years of World War I, Rasputin's increasing drunkenness, sexual promiscuity and willingness to accept bribes (in return for helping petitioners who flocked to his apartment), as well as his efforts to have his critics dismissed from their posts, made him appear increasingly cynical. Attaining divine grace through sin seems to have been one of the central secret doctrines which Rasputin preached to (and practiced with) his inner circle of society ladies.\n\nDuring World War I, Rasputin became the focus of accusations of unpatriotic influence at court. The unpopular Tsarina, meanwhile, who was of Anglo-German descent, was accused of acting as a spy in German employ. When Rasputin expressed an interest in going to the front to bless the troops early in the war, the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Duke Nicholas, promised to hang him if he dared to show up there. Rasputin then claimed that he had a revelation that the Russian armies would not be successful until the Tsar personally took command. With this, the ill-prepared Tsar Nicholas proceeded to take personal command of the Russian army, with dire consequences for himself as well as for Russia. While Tsar Nicholas II was away at war, Rasputin's influence over Tsarina Alexandra increased. He soon became her confidant and personal adviser, and he convinced her to fill some governmental offices with his own handpicked candidates. To advance his power further in the highest circles of Russian society, Rasputin cohabited with upper-class women in exchange for granting political favors.\n\nWorld War I, the ossifying effects of feudalism, and a meddling government bureaucracy all contributed to Russia's declining economy at a very rapid rate. Many at the time laid the blame with Alexandra and with Rasputin, because of his influence over her. Here is an example:\nVladimir Purishkevich was an outspoken member of the Duma. On November 19, 1916, Purishkevich made a rousing speech in the Duma, in which he stated, \"The tsar's ministers who have been turned into marionettes, marionettes whose threads have been taken firmly in hand by Rasputin and the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna — the evil genius of Russia and the Tsarina ... who has remained a German on the Russian throne and alien to the country and its people.\" Felix Yusupov attended the speech and afterwards contacted Purishkevich, who quickly agreed to participate in the murder of Rasputin.\nRasputin's influence over the royal family was used against him and the Romanovs by politicians and journalists who wanted to weaken the integrity of the dynasty, force the Tsar to give up his absolute political power and separate the Russian Orthodox Church from the state. Rasputin unintentionally contributed to their propaganda by having public disputes with clergy members, bragging about his ability to influence both the Tsar and Tsarina, and also by his dissolute and very public lifestyle. Nobles in influential positions around the Tsar, as well as some parties of the Duma, clamored for Rasputin's removal from the court. Perhaps inadvertently, Rasputin had contributed to the diminishing respect the Tsar's subjects had for him.\n\nOn a 33-year-old peasant woman named Chionya Guseva attempted to assassinate Rasputin by stabbing him in the stomach outside his home in Pokrovskoye. Rasputin was seriously wounded, and for a time it was not clear that he would survive. After surgery and some time in a hospital in Tyumen, however, he did recover.\n\nGuseva was a follower of Iliodor, a former priest who had supported Rasputin before denouncing his sexual escapades and self-aggrandizement in December 1911. A radical conservative and anti-semite, Iliodor had been part of a group of establishment figures who had attempted to drive a wedge between the royal family and Rasputin in 1911. When this effort failed, Iliodor had been banished from St. Petersburg and was ultimately defrocked. Guseva claimed to have acted alone, having read about Rasputin in the newspapers and believing him to be a \"false prophet and even an Antichrist.\" Both the police and Rasputin, however, believed that Iliodor had played some role in the attempt on Rasputin's life. Iliodor fled the country before he could be questioned about the assassination attempt, and Guseva was found to be not responsible for her actions due to insanity.\n\nAccording to his daughter Maria, Rasputin was very much changed by the experience and began to drink alcohol.\n\nHaving decided that Rasputin's influence over the Tsarina had made him a threat to the empire, a group of nobles led by Prince Felix Yusupov, the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, and the right-wing politician Vladimir Purishkevich concocted a plan to kill Rasputin in December 1916, apparently by luring Rasputin to the Yusupovs' Moika Palace.\n\nRasputin was murdered during the early morning on , at the home of Felix Yusupov. He died of three gunshot wounds, one of which was a close-range shot to his forehead. Beyond this, little is certain about his death, and the circumstances of his death have been the subject of considerable speculation. According to historian Douglas Smith, \"what really happened at the Yusupov home on 17 December will never be known.\" The story of Rasputin's death that Yusupov recounted in his memoirs, however, has become the most frequently told version of events.\n\nAccording to Yusupov, he invited Rasputin to his home shortly after midnight and ushered him into the basement. Yusupov offered Rasputin tea and cakes which had been laced with cyanide. At first, Rasputin refused the cakes, but then began to eat them. To Yusupov's surprise, Rasputin did not appear to be affected by the poison. Rasputin then asked for some Madeira wine (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress. At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting. Taking a revolver from Dmitry Pavlovich, Yusupov returned to the basement and, referring to a crucifix that was in the room, told Rasputin that he'd \"better look at the crucifix and say a prayer,\" then shot him once in the chest. Believing him to be dead, they then drove to Rasputin's apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin's coat and hat, in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night. Upon returning to the Moika Palace, Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead. Suddenly, Rasputin leapt up and attacked Yusupov, who – with some effort – freed himself and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed and made it into the palace's courtyard before being shot by Purishkevich and collapsing into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped Rasputin's body in cloth, drove it to the Petrovsky Bridge and dropped it into the Malaya Nevka River.\n\nNews of Rasputin's murder spread quickly, even before his body was found. According to Douglas Smith, Purishkevich spoke openly about Rasputin's murder to two soldiers, and to a policeman who was investigating reports of shots shortly after the event, but urged them not to tell anyone else. An investigation was launched the next morning, as rumors that Rasputin had been killed were already circulating. One newspaper, the \"Stock Exchange Gazette,\" even ran a report of Rasputin's death \"after a party in one of the most aristocratic homes in the center of the city\" on the afternoon of .\n\nWhen two workmen noticed blood on the railing of the Petrovsky Bridge and a boot was found on the ice below, river police began searching the area for Rasputin's body. His body was found under the river ice on January 1 [O.S. 19 December], approximately 200 meters downstream from the bridge. An autopsy was conducted by Dr. Dmitry Kosorotov, the city's senior autopsy surgeon. The report that Kosorotov wrote was later lost, but he later stated that Rasputin's body had shown signs of severe trauma, including three gunshot wounds - one of which had been sustained at close range, and to the forehead - a slice wound to his left side, and many other injuries, many of which Kosorotov felt had been sustained post-mortem. Kosorotov found a single bullet in Rasputin's body, but stated that it was too badly deformed and of a type too widely used to trace. He found no evidence that Rasputin had been poisoned. According to both Douglas Smith and Joseph Fuhrmann, Kosorotov found no water in Rasputin's lungs, and reports that Rasputin had been thrown into the water alive were incorrect. Contrary to some later accounts that claimed that Rasputin's penis had been severed, Kosorotov found his genitals intact.\n\nRasputin was buried on January 2 [O.S. December 21] at a small church that Anna Vyrubova had been building at Tsarskoye Selo. The funeral was attended only by the royal family and a few of their intimates. Rasputin's wife, mistress, and children were not invited, although his daughters met with the Royal family at Vyrubova's home later that day. His body was exhumed and burned by an attachment of soldiers shortly after the Tsar abdicated the throne in March 1917, in order to prevent his burial site from becoming a shrine or a rallying point for supporters of the old regime.\n\nSome writers – including Oleg Shishkin, Andrew Cook, Richard Cullen, and Michael Smith – have suggested that agents of the British Secret Intelligence Service (BSIS) were involved in Rasputin's assassination. According to this theory, British agents were concerned that Rasputin was urging the tsar to make a separate peace with Germany and withdraw from the war, and that this would allow Germany to transfer a large number of troops to the Western Front. The theory suggests, in other words, that British agents played an active role in Rasputin's assassination in order to keep Russia in the war and force Germany to keep defending the Eastern Front. While there are several variants of this theory, in general they suggest that British intelligence agents under the command of Samuel Hoare, and in particular Oswald Rayner – who had attended Oxford University with Yusopov – were directly involved in planning and carrying out the assassination, or that Rayner had personally shot Rasputin. However, historians do not seriously consider this theory. According to historian Douglas Smith, \"there is no convincing evidence that places any British agents at the murder scene.\" Historian Keith Jeffrey has stated that if British Intelligence agents had been involved in the assassination of Rasputin, \"I would have expected to find some trace of that\" in the MI6 archives, but that no such evidence exists.\n\nRasputin's daughter, Maria Rasputin (Matryona Rasputina) (1898–1977), emigrated to France after the October Revolution, and then to the U.S. There she worked as a dancer and then a lion tamer in a circus.\n\nNumerous film and stage productions have been based on the life of Rasputin.\n\n\n"}

He was born prematurely, reportedly small enough to fit in the palm of his father's hand, and immediately developed enteritis, a disease of the small intestine. He eventually recovered after several injections of potassium and calcium in saline.\n\nSagawa first experienced cannibalistic desires while in the first grade, after seeing a male's thigh. In a 2011 interview with \"Vice\", Sagawa reported that as a youth he partook in bestiality with his dog and experienced cannibalistic desires for women.\n\nAt 23, in Tokyo, Sagawa followed a tall German woman home, then broke into her apartment while she was sleeping with intent to cannibalize her by tearing and walking away with a small part of her flesh. She awoke and, Sagawa claims, pushed him to the ground. He was captured by police and charged with attempted rape. He did not confess his true intentions to authorities.\n\nIn 1977, at the age of 27, Sagawa emigrated to France to pursue a Ph.D. in literature at the Sorbonne in Paris. He claims that while residing in Paris, \"Almost every night I would bring a prostitute home and then try to shoot them, but for some reason my fingers froze up and I couldn't pull the trigger.\"\n\nOn June 11, 1981, Sagawa, then 32, invited his Sorbonne classmate Renée Hartevelt to dinner at his apartment under the pretext of translating poetry for a school assignment. He planned to kill and eat her, having selected her for her health and beauty; characteristics he believed he lacked. He is weak, ugly, and small (he is 1.448 m (4 ft 9 in) tall) and claims he wanted to absorb her energy. She was 25 years old and 1.78 m (5 ft 10 in). After she arrived, she began reading poetry at a desk with her back to him. He shot her in the neck with a rifle. Sagawa said he fainted after the shock of shooting her, but awoke with the realization that he had to carry out his plan. He raped her corpse but was unable to bite into her skin, so he left the apartment and purchased a butcher knife. For two days, Sagawa ate various parts of her body, saving other parts in his refrigerator. He then attempted to dump her body in a lake in the Bois de Boulogne, but was seen in the act and arrested by French police. When he was caught, he was carrying two suitcases. Those suitcases contained the dismembered body parts of Renée Hartevelt.\n\nSagawa's wealthy father provided a lawyer for his defense, and after being held for two years awaiting trial Sagawa was found legally insane and unfit to stand trial by the French judge, Jean-Louis Bruguière, who ordered him held indefinitely in a mental institution. After a visit by the author Inuhiko Yomota, Sagawa's account of his kill was published in Japan under the title \"In the Fog\". Sagawa's subsequent publicity and macabre celebrity likely contributed to the French authorities' decision to deport him to Japan, where he was immediately committed to Matsuzawa hospital. Examining psychologists there all declared him sane and found sexual perversion was his sole motivation for murder. Because charges in France had been dropped, the French court documents were sealed and were not released to Japanese authorities; consequently Sagawa could not legally be detained in Japan. He checked himself out of the hospital on August 12, 1986, and remained free. Sagawa's continued freedom has been widely criticized.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1997 he was frequently invited to be a guest speaker and commentator. In 1992, he appeared in Hisayasu Sato's exploitation film \"Uwakizuma: Chijokuzeme (Unfaithful Wife: Shameful Torture)\" as a sado-sexual voyeur. Sagawa has written books about his kill, as well as \"Shonen A\", a book on the 1997 Kobe child murders. He has also written restaurant reviews for the Japanese magazine \"Spa\". Sagawa can no longer find publishers for his writing and he has struggled to find employment. He was nearly accepted by a French-language school because the manager was impressed by his courage in using his real name, but employees protested and he was rejected.\n\nIn 2005 Sagawa's parents died. He was prevented from attending their funeral, but repaid their creditors and moved into public housing. He received welfare benefits for a time. In an interview with \"Vice\" magazine in 2011, he said that being forced to make a living while being known as a murderer and cannibal was a terrible punishment. In 2013 he was hospitalized from a cerebral infarction which permanently damaged his nervous system. Since being released he has been under the full-time care of his brother.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3337457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3337457", "title": "Jackson family", "text": "Jackson family\n\nThe Jackson family is an American family of musicians from Gary, Indiana. Performing as members of The Jackson 5 and as solo artists, the children of Joseph Walter and Katherine Esther Jackson were successful in the field of popular music from the late 1960s onwards. As a group, the eldest sons Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, Michael, and later with the inclusion of Randy. The members who managed to be solo icons in music are Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson. The Jackson 5 became known as the \"First Family of Soul\" (a title first held by the Five Stairsteps). The continued success of Michael and Janet's careers as solo artists led the Jacksons to become known as the \"Royal Family of Pop\". All nine of the Jackson siblings have gold records to their credits with La Toya holding the distinction of being the first Jackson sister to attain one (awarded by France's SNEP for \"Reggae Night\", a song she co-wrote for Jimmy Cliff), and now to Janet Jackson for being the first black woman to receive the Billboard Icon Award. \n\nThe Jackson family has been the subject of controversy linked to the Jordan Chandler Case. But the most controversial facts of Jackson's private life are accusations made by his sons against family patriarch Joseph Jackson claiming that he was harassed by his father as a child.\n\nDespite these circumstances and other problems, the Jacksons continued to be one of the most influential families in the United States and in recent years some family members have been honored for their work; in 1997 The Jackson 5 was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Michael would follow the group to the hall in 2001. The Jacksons, Michael and Janet all received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980, 1984 and 1990 respectively. Joseph was recognized as \"the best musical businessman of all time\" by the city of Cleveland in 2002. In 2009 a new series from A&E entitled \"\" premiered documenting the Jackson brothers dealing with the sudden loss of Michael and preparing for a Jackson 5 Reunion tour.\n\nThe most popular members of the Jackson family are Michael Jackson, known as the \"King of Pop\" and Janet Jackson, often considered one of the most influential pop and R&B artists of all time.\n\nJoseph Walter Jackson was born on July 26, 1928 in Arkansas but he grew up in Oakland, California with his father Samuel Jackson, a school teacher. At age 18 he moved to East Chicago, Indiana to be with his mother Crystal Lee King and to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional boxer. At age 21, Joseph married Katherine Scruse, 19, immediately starting a family. Even though he wanted to be a success in boxing it wasn’t a job for a family man, so he obtained a job as an overhead crane operator with East Chicago's Inland Steel Company. His family continued to grow steadily and over the course of sixteen years he and Katherine had a house full of nine children. Joe Jackson always wanted to make it big and although he couldn’t in boxing or in his own short musical stint in the 1950s with the band The Falcons, he saw the talent in his children, starting with Tito and Tito's ability to play the guitar.\n\nSoon enough Joe Jackson formed a band of his sons Tito, Jermaine, and Jackie called The Jackson Brothers in 1964 and became their manager. After several years of doing local talent shows, Joseph enlarged the band to include Marlon and Michael, two of his younger sons, and then changed the name of the band to The Jackson Five by 1966, remaining the group's manager. As their father he was a very strict disciplinarian and had an abusive nature and as their manager he enforced long practice sessions of singing and dancing in hopes of preparing them to make it big one day. In August 1967, the group made a debut at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York where they won the Amateur Night contest. Gordon Keith, the owner and producer at Steeltown Records in Gary, Indiana, discovered the \"Jackson Five\" and signed them to their first contract in November 1967. “Big Boy”, the boys' first record which was produced by Keith, was released on January 30, 1968. It became a local hit. In March 1969, they signed a Motown record contract and became known as the \"Jackson 5\". The group enjoyed the fame Joseph Jackson had been longing for in his life. He continued to manage The Jackson 5 into stardom and after the band they had many No. 1 hits on the \"Billboard\" hot singles charts; Joseph moved them to a mansion in Encino, California with his own hefty salary he had obtained as their full-time manager. After many years as a band and with Michael as lead singer, the group continued to churn out even more hits and wealth, but tensions grew and in 1979, Michael severed ties with his father/manager and went on to pursue a solo musical entertainment career. Four years later, in 1983, Michael's siblings fired Joseph Jackson as their manager. In 1993, Michael Jackson accused his father of physical and mental abuse; a few of the other siblings confirmed this claim, but others denied it.\n\nKatherine Jackson (née Kattie B. Scruse) was born on May 4, 1930 in Barbour County, Alabama, the child of Prince Albert Scruse (1907–1997) and Martha Mattie Upshaw (1907–1990). She was left with a permanent limp after acquiring polio syndrome in her childhood. She later recovered from her illness after moving with her family to East Chicago, Indiana, where she would remain until meeting her husband Joseph Jackson. The couple moved and bought a small home in Gary, Indiana, where they birthed and raised nine children and she was a stay-at-home mother. Throughout her life, Katherine remained a devoted Jehovah's Witness and raised her children strictly under the same spiritual teachings she received. Also, as a talented pianist and vocalist who shared her talents with her children, she was later credited for being the foundation of her children's success. After her sons' rise to fame as The Jackson 5, she strongly supported her children and became the costume designer for their shows and performances. Some of the memorable moments of her unconditional support were seen when her son Michael was tried for molestation charges in 1993 and 2005. Katherine now lives in Calabasas, California where she cares for the children of her late son, Michael. After allegations that she may have been held against her will by Randy and Janet Jackson, Katherine lost custody of Michael's children, ultimately regaining it in 2012.\n\nTogether, Joseph and Katherine Jackson had ten children. Their son Brandon (Marlon's twin) died shortly after birth. The other nine grew up to become professional musicians.\n\n\nThere are 26 children that make up the third generation of the Jackson family along with several great-grandchildren. Among them, some have followed in the family's footsteps into the entertainment industry.\nThe three children of Michael Jackson are probably the most well-known of the third generation.\nMichael Joseph Jackson Jr. (b. February 13, 1997), also known as \"Prince\", Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson (b. April 3, 1998), and Prince Michael Jackson II also known as \"Blanket\" now called \"Bigi\" (b. February 21, 2002), have been discussed in the press numerous times throughout their lives, particularly since their father's death in 2009.\n\nRebbie, Tito, Jackie, Jermaine and Janet Jackson have also had children, who have come under varying degrees of media focus. Austin Brown (b. 1985), the only son of Rebbie Jackson, is a singer and songwriter who has released several successful singles in the pop/R&B genre. Tito Jackson's three sons, Toriano Adaryll \"Taj\" Jackson, Jr. (b. 1973), Taryll Adren Jackson (b. 1975), and Tito Joe \"TJ\" Jackson (b. 1978) make up the R&B/pop music group 3T. 3T has released three studio albums and has gone on to have moderate success in the industry, primarily outside of the United States. Sigmund \"Siggy\" Jackson Jr. (b. 1977), the eldest son to Jackie Jackson, is a hip-hop artist who goes under the name \"Dealz\". Siggy has been a ghostwriter for a number of independent artists and has obtained mild success as a solo artist. Jermaine La Jaune \"Jay\" Jackson Jr. (b. 1977), the eldest son to Jermaine Jackson, portrayed his father in the 1992 miniseries, \"\", a biopic about the Jackson family. On January 3, 2017, at the age of 50, Janet gave birth to Eissa Al Mana, the newest member of the Jackson family.\n"}

Cabot claims to be related to the prominent Boston Brahmin Cabot family. She is a part of Salem lore, and a local celebrity in that city and throughout the Massachusetts North Shore.\n\nLaurie Cabot was born Mercedes Elizabeth Kearsey. She grew up in California and came east to New England as a teenager. She maintains that her interest in the occult began in childhood. She developed this interest in Boston through time she spent as a young woman in the halls of the Boston Public Library.\n\nDuring the 1950s Cabot worked as a dancer in a Boston nightclub called \"The Latin Quarter\" owned by Lou Walters, the father of TV journalist Barbara Walters. Cabot was asked by Mr. Walters to open his Las Vegas Latin Quarter, \nbut she declined.\n\nCabot married and divorced twice, with each marriage producing a daughter, Jody Cabot (b. 1963) and Penny Cabot (b. 1965), respectively. Cabot chose to raise her daughters as Witches, and she began appearing in black robes and black eye-makeup in her everyday life. She identifies herself as a Witch, but not as a follower of the modern Wiccan religion, because she practiced Witchcraft before Wicca became a popular movement. The kind of Witchcraft she practices focuses on the Art and Science of Witchcraft. Many of Laurie Cabot's lectures focus on energy, instead of a focus on religious particulars, thus making her brand of the Craft Traditional Witchcraft.\n\nIn 1970 TV's sitcom \"Bewitched\" visited Salem for a series of episodes with location filming. Laurie Cabot opened the town's first \"Witch shop\" in Salem in 1971, which became a tourist destination thanks to the national TV exposure.\n\nAfter 10 straight losses in May 1976, things were looking so bad for the Red Sox that a Boston radio station hired Laurie Cabot, a genuine Salem witch, to remove a curse that had allegedly been cast upon the team by an Orioles-employed witch doctor from Kenya. Cabot is pictured here examining the aura of Dwight Evans before a May 13 game in Cleveland. \n\nCabot was featured prominently in Season 5 of the science/documentary series \"In Search of...\", hosted by Leonard Nimoy, in Episode 13: \"Salem Witches\", originally aired 13 December 1980. The episode spent much time on Cabot's activities as a leader in the local community of witches in Salem.\n\nIn 1986, after the release of the film version of \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" John Updike's novel about single suburban women venturing into the occult, Cabot established the Witches' League for Public Awareness to counter negative images of her religion in popular culture and the media. \"Here are three women who have nothing better to do, because they are so frustrated sexually, than to get involved with witchcraft,\" Cabot said of the movie. \"They are not witches. If they are anything, they are weekend Satanists. They don't do one witchy thing in the whole film.\"\n\nCabot's shop sold herbs, jewelry, Tarot decks, and other items used in witchcraft. She later relocated her shop to an old gambrel-roofed house on Essex Street. This new shop was named \"Crow Haven Corner\". The physical store is still open, though no longer owned or managed by any member of the Cabot family (formerly, her eldest daughter Jody owned and ran it). Cabot's final shop in Salem, The Cat, The Crow and the Crown on Pickering Wharf, later renamed The Official Witch Shoppe, closed its doors in February 2012. Cabot still maintains an online shop by the same name that is frequently patronized, and is an important resource to many witches. She is as well known for her businesses, lectures and books. Cabot was a guest on both \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and on Phil Donahue's talk shows in the late 1980s.\n\nIn March 2008, Cabot celebrated her 75th birthday at a surprise birthday party attended by hundreds of witches, including Sully Erna of the band Godsmack, for whom Cabot had appeared in the band's \"Voodoo\" music video shot at Hammond Castle.\n\nCabot is also known for her sometimes controversial behavior. There was a legal situation in the mid 1990s in which Cabot allegedly threatened local real estate agent, Janet Andrews, with her gun. Cabot denied she had ever acted in such a manner and upon further investigation all charges against Cabot were dismissed and she still retains a gun permit.\n\nShe garnered more notoriety in 2004 when Salem Police came to her home in order to remove her adolescent grandson over a custody issue between Jody Cabot and her former husband. Both incidents were covered by local and national press and even featured on CNN. A policeman claimed that during the incident Cabot ordered him to look into her eyes, telling him he was cursed once he did. Cabot denies she ever cursed the policeman, stating \"I say it is a curse when you do bad things.\"\n\nJody Cabot was dismissed after being accused of stealing money from her mother and all ties between them were severed. \n\nPenny Cabot is currently Laurie's partner in running their business interests.\n\n\n"}

As the spirit rules over the forest and hunting, he may be related to the Slavic god Porewit. \n\nThere is also a deity, named Svyatibor (Svyatobor, Svyatibog), who is mentioned in the beliefs of the Eastern and Western Slavs as the god of forests and the lord of the leshies.

He is sometimes portrayed with horns and surrounded by packs of wolves and bears. In some accounts, Leshy is described as having a wife (\"Leshachikha\", \"Leszachka\", \"Lesovikha\") and children (\"leshonki\", \"leszonky\"). He is known by some to have a propensity to lead travelers astray and abduct children, (which he shares with Chort, the \"Black One\") which would lead some to believe he is an evil entity. He is however also known to have a more neutral disposition towards humans, dependent on the attitudes and behaviours of an individual person, or local population, towards the forest. Some would therefore describe him as more of a temperamental being like a fairy.\n\nThe Leshy is known by a variety of names and spellings including the following:\n\nMain name variations:\n\nEuphemistic titles:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "160760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160760", "title": "Linda Ronstadt", "text": "Linda Ronstadt\n\nLinda Maria Ronstadt (born July 15, 1946) is an American retired popular music singer known for singing in a wide range of genres including rock, country, light opera, and Latin. She has earned 11 Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music awards, an Emmy Award, and an ALMA Award, and many of her albums have been certified gold, platinum or multiplatinum in the United States and internationally. She has also earned nominations for a Tony Award and a Golden Globe award. She was awarded the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award by The Latin Recording Academy in 2011 and also awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award by The Recording Academy in 2016. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014. On July 28, 2014, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities. In 2019, she will receive a joint star with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn total, she has released over 30 studio albums and 15 compilation or greatest hits albums. Ronstadt charted 38 \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles, with 21 reaching the top 40, 10 in the top 10, three at number 2, and \"You're No Good\" at number 1. This success did not translate to the UK, with only her single \"Blue Bayou\" reaching the UK Top 40. Her duet with Aaron Neville, \"Don't Know Much\", peaked at number 2 in December 1989. In addition, she has charted 36 albums, 10 top-10 albums and three number 1 albums on the \"Billboard\" Pop Album Chart. Her autobiography, \"Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir\", was published in September 2013. It debuted in the Top 10 on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\n\nRonstadt has collaborated with artists in diverse genres, including Bette Midler, Billy Eckstine, Frank Zappa, Rosemary Clooney, Flaco Jiménez, Philip Glass, Warren Zevon, Emmylou Harris, Gram Parsons, Dolly Parton, Neil Young, Paul Simon, Johnny Cash, and Nelson Riddle. She has lent her voice to over 120 albums and has sold more than 100 million records, making her one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. Christopher Loudon, of \"Jazz Times\", wrote in 2004 that Ronstadt is \"blessed with arguably the most sterling set of pipes of her generation.\"\n\nAfter completing her last live concert in late 2009, Ronstadt retired in 2011. She was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in December 2012, which left her unable to sing.\n\nLinda Maria Ronstadt was born in 1946 in Tucson, Arizona, the third of four children of Gilbert Ronstadt (19111995), a prosperous machinery merchant who ran the F. Ronstadt Co., and Ruth Mary (Copeman) Ronstadt (19141982), a homemaker.\n\nRonstadt was raised on the family's ranch with her siblings Peter (who served as Tucson's Chief of Police for 10 years, 19811991), Michael J., and Gretchen (Suzy). The family was featured in \"Family Circle\" magazine in 1953.\n\nLinda's father came from a pioneering Arizona ranching family and was of German, English, and Mexican ancestry. The family's influence on and contributions to Arizona's history, including wagon making, commerce, pharmacies, and music, are chronicled in the library of the University of Arizona. Linda Ronstadt's great-grandfather, graduate engineer Friedrich August Ronstadt (who went by Federico Augusto Ronstadt) immigrated to the Southwest (then a part of Mexico) in the 1840s from Hanover, Germany, and married a Mexican citizen, eventually settling in Tucson. In 1991, the City of Tucson opened its central transit terminal on March 16 and dedicated it to Linda's grandfather, Federico José María Ronstadt, a local pioneer businessman; he was a wagon maker whose early contribution to the city's mobility included six mule-drawn streetcars delivered in 190304.\n\nHer mother Ruth Mary, of German, English, and Dutch ancestry, was raised in Flint, Michigan. She was a daughter of Lloyd Groff Copeman, a prolific inventor and holder of many patents. Copeman, with nearly 700 patents to his name, invented an early form of the toaster, many refrigerator devices, the grease gun, the first electric stove, and an early form of the microwave oven. His flexible rubber ice cube tray earned him millions of dollars in royalties.\n\nEstablishing her professional career in the mid-1960s at the forefront of California's emerging folk rock and country rock movementsgenres which defined post-1960s rock musicRonstadt joined forces with Bobby Kimmel and Kenny Edwards and became the lead singer of a folk-rock trio, the Stone Poneys. Later, as a solo artist, she released \"Hand Sown ... Home Grown\" in 1969, which has been described as the first alternative country record by a female recording artist. Although fame eluded her during these years, Ronstadt actively toured with the Doors, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, and others, appeared numerous times on television shows, and began to contribute her singing to albums by other artists.\n\nWith the release of chart-topping albums such as \"Heart Like a Wheel\", \"Simple Dreams\", and \"Living in the USA\", Ronstadt became the first female \"arena class\" rock star. She set records as one of the top-grossing concert artists of the decade. Referred to as the \"First Lady of Rock\" and the \"Queen of Rock\", Ronstadt was voted the Top Female Pop Singer of the 1970s. Her rock-and-roll image was as famous as her music; she appeared six times on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\" and on the covers of \"Newsweek\" and \"Time\".\n\nIn the 1980s, Ronstadt went to Broadway and garnered a Tony nomination for her performance in \"The Pirates of Penzance\", teamed with the composer Philip Glass, recorded traditional music, and collaborated with the conductor Nelson Riddle, an event at that time viewed as an original and unorthodox move for a rock-and-roll artist. This venture paid off, and Ronstadt remained one of the music industry's best-selling acts throughout the 1980s, with multi-platinum-selling albums such as \"What's New\", \"Canciones de Mi Padre\", and \"Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind\". She continued to tour, collaborate, and record celebrated albums, such as \"Winter Light\" and \"Hummin' to Myself\", until her retirement in 2011.\nMost of Ronstadt's albums are certified gold, platinum, or multi-platinum. Having sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide and setting records as one of the top-grossing concert performers for over a decade, Ronstadt was the most successful female singer of the 1970s and stands as one of the most successful female recording artists in U.S. history. Ronstadt opened many doors for women in rock and roll and other musical genres by championing songwriters and musicians, pioneering her chart success onto the concert circuit, and being at the vanguard of many musical movements.\n\nRonstadt's early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including Mexican music, which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood.\n\nRonstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own recordsrock and roll, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachiis all music she heard her family sing in their living room, or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of Gilbert and Sullivan and her father for introducing her to the traditional pop and Great American Songbook repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation.\n\nEarly on, her singing style had been influenced by singers such as Lola Beltrán and Édith Piaf; she has called their singing and rhythms \"more like Greek music ... It's sort of like 6/8 time signature ... very hard driving and very intense.\" She also drew influence from country singer Hank Williams.\n\nShe has said that \"all girl singers\" eventually \"have to curtsy to Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday\". Of Maria Callas, Ronstadt says, \"There's no one in her league. That's it. Period. I learn more ... about singing rock n roll from listening to Maria Callas records than I ever would from listening to pop music for a month of Sundays. ... She's the greatest chick singer ever.\" She admires Callas for her musicianship and her attempts to push 20th-century singing, particularly opera, back into the bel canto \"natural style of singing\".\n\nA self-described product of American radio of the 1950s and 1960s, Ronstadt is a fan of its eclectic and diverse music programming.\n\nAt age 14, Ronstadt formed a folk trio with her brother Peter and sister Gretchen. The group played coffeehouses, fraternity houses, and other small venues, billing themselves as \"the Union City Ramblers\" and \"the Three Ronstadts\", and they even recorded themselves at a Tucson studio under the name \"the New Union Ramblers\". Their repertoire included the music they grew up onfolk, country, bluegrass, and Mexican. But increasingly, Ronstadt wanted to make a union of folk music and rock 'n' roll, and in 1964, after a semester at Arizona State University, the 18-year-old decided to move to Los Angeles.\n\nRonstadt visited a friend from Tucson, Bobby Kimmel, in Los Angeles during Easter break from college in 1964, and later that year, shortly before her eighteenth birthday, decided to move there permanently to form a band with him. Kimmel had already begun co-writing folk-rock songs with guitarist-songwriter Kenny Edwards, and eventually the three of them were signed by Nik Venet to Capitol in the summer of 1966 as \"the Stone Poneys\". The trio released three albums in a 15-month period in 196768: \"The Stone Poneys\"; \"Evergreen, Volume 2\"; and \"Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III\". The band is best known for their hit single \"Different Drum\" (written by Michael Nesmith prior to his joining the Monkees), which reached number 13 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart as well as number 12 in \"Cashbox\" magazine. Nearly 50 years later, the song remains one of Ronstadt's most popular recordings.\n\nIn 2008 Australia's Raven Records released a compilation CD titled \"The Stone Poneys\". The disc features all tracks from the first two Stone Poneys albums and four tracks from the third album.\n\nStill contractually obligated to Capitol Records, Ronstadt released her first solo album, \"Hand Sown ... Home Grown\", in 1969. It has been called the first alternative country record by a female recording artist. During this same period, she contributed to the \"Music from Free Creek\" \"super session\" project.\n\nRonstadt provided the vocals for some commercials during this period, including one for Remington electric razors, in which a multitracked Ronstadt and Frank Zappa claimed that the electric razor \"cleans you, thrills you ... may even keep you from getting busted\".\n\nRonstadt's second solo album, \"Silk Purse\", was released in March 1970. Recorded entirely in Nashville, it was produced by Elliot Mazer, whom Ronstadt chose on the advice of Janis Joplin, who had worked with him on the \"Cheap Thrills\" album. The \"Silk Purse\" album cover showed Ronstadt in a muddy pigpen, while the back and inside cover depicted her onstage wearing bright red. Ronstadt has stated that she was not pleased with the album, although it provided her with her first solo hit, the multi-format single \"Long, Long Time\", and earned her first Grammy nomination (for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance/Female).\n\nIn 1975, Ronstadt performed shows with Jackson Browne, the Eagles, and Toots and the Maytals. In a 1976 \"Rolling Stone\" interview with Cameron Crowe, Ronstadt said, \"they haven't invented a word for that loneliness that everybody goes through on the road. The world is tearing by you, real fast, and all these people are looking at you. ... People see me in my 'girl-singer' suit.\" In 1974 she told Peter Knobler in \"Crawdaddy\", \"People are always taking advantage of you; everybody that's interested in you has got an angle.\"\n\nSeveral years before Ronstadt became what author Gerri Hirshey called the first \"arena-class rock diva\" with \"hugely anticipated tours\" she began her solo career touring the North American concert circuit. But being on the road took its toll both emotionally and professionally. There were few \"girl singers\" on the rock circuit at the time, and they were relegated to \"groupie level when in a crowd of a bunch of rock and roll guys\", a status Ronstadt avoided. Relating to men on a professional level as fellow musicians led to competition, insecurity, bad romances, and a series of boyfriend-managers. At the time, she admired singers like Maria Muldaur for not sacrificing their femininity but says she felt enormous self-imposed pressure to compete with \"the boys\" at every level. She noted in a 1969 interview in \"Fusion Magazine\" that it was difficult being a single \"chick singer\" with an all-male backup band. According to her, it was difficult to get a band of backing musicians because of their ego problem of being labeled sidemen for a female singer.\n\nSoon after she went solo in the late 1960s, one of her first backing bands was the pioneering country-rock band Swampwater, which combined Cajun and swamp-rock elements in their music. Its members included Cajun fiddler Gib Guilbeau and John Beland, who later joined the Flying Burrito Brothers, as well as Stan Pratt, Thad Maxwell, and Eric White, brother of Clarence White of the Byrds. Swampwater went on to back Ronstadt during TV appearances on \"The Johnny Cash Show\" and \"The Mike Douglas Show\", and at the Big Sur Folk Festival.\n\nAnother backing band included Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner, who went on to form the Eagles. They toured with her for a short period in 1971 and played on \"Linda Ronstadt\", her self-titled third album, from which the failed single, Ronstadt's version of Browne's \"Rock Me on the Water\", was drawn. At this stage, Ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend John Boylan. She said, \"As soon as I started working with John Boylan, I started co-producing myself. I was always a part of my productions. But I always needed a producer who would carry out my whims.\" Also in 1971, Ronstadt began talking with David Geffen about moving from Capitol Records to Geffen's Asylum Records label.\n\nRonstadt began her fourth solo album, \"Don't Cry Now\", in 1973, with Boylan (who had negotiated her contract with Asylum Records) and John David \"J.D.\" Souther producing most of the album's tracks. But needing someone willing to work with her as an equal, Ronstadt asked Peter Asher, who came highly recommended to her by James Taylor's sister Kate Taylor, to help produce two of them: \"Sail Away\" and \"I Believe in You\".\n\nThe album featured Ronstadt's first country hit, \"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\", which she had first recorded on \"Hand Sown ... Home Grown\"this time hitting the Country Top 20.\n\nWith the release of \"Don't Cry Now\", Ronstadt took on her biggest gig to date as the opening act on Neil Young's \"Time Fades Away\" tour, playing for larger crowds than ever before. Backstage at a concert in Texas, Chris Hillman introduced her to Emmylou Harris, telling them, \"You two could be good friends\", which soon occurred, resulting in frequent collaborations over the following years. Meanwhile, the album became Ronstadt's most successful up to that time, selling 300,000 copies by the end of 1974.\n\nAsher turned out to be more collaborative, and more on the same page with her musically, than any producer she had worked with previously. Ronstadt's professional relationship with Asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio. Although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a \"woman of strong opinions (who) knew what she wanted to do (with her career)\", he nonetheless agreed to become her full-time producer, and remained in that role through the late 1980s. Asher attributed the long-term success of his working relationship with Ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship. \"It must be a lot harder to have objective conversations about someone's career when it's someone you sleep with\", he said.\n\nAsher executive produced a tribute CD called \"\", released September 6, 2011, on which Ronstadt's 1976 version of Buddy Holly's \"That'll Be The Day\" appears among newly recorded versions of Holly's songs by various artists.\n\nRonstadt captured the sounds of country music and the rhythms of ranchera musicwhich she likened in 1968 to \"Mexican bluegrass\"and redirected them into her rock 'n' roll and some of her pop music. Many of these rhythms and sounds were part of her Southwestern roots. Likewise, a country sound and style, a fusion of country music and rock 'n' roll called Country rock, started to exert its influence on mainstream pop music around the late 1960s, and it became an emerging movement Ronstadt helped form and commercialize. However, as early as 1970, Ronstadt was being criticized by music \"purists\" for her \"brand of music\" which crossed many genres. \"Country Western Stars\" magazine wrote in 1970 that \"Rock people thought she was too gentle, folk people thought she was too pop, and pop people didn't quite understand where she was at, but Country people really loved Linda.\" She never categorized herself and stuck to her genre-crossing brand of music.\n\nRonstadt is considered an \"interpreter of her times\", and has earned praise for her courage to put her \"stamp\" on many of her songs. Nevertheless, her hits were criticized in some quarters for being cover songs. Ronstadt herself has indicated that some of her 70s hits were recorded under considerable pressure to create commercially successful recordings, and that she prefers many of her songs that were non-hit album tracks. An infrequent songwriter, Ronstadt co-composed only three songs over her long career.\n\nRonstadt's natural vocal range spans several octaves from contralto to soprano, and occasionally she will showcase this entire range within a single work. Ronstadt was the first female artist in popular music history to accumulate four consecutive platinum albums (fourteen certified million selling, to date). As for the singles, \"Rolling Stone\" pointed out that a whole generation, \"but for her, might never have heard the work of artists such as Buddy Holly, Elvis Costello, and Chuck Berry.\"\n\nOthers have argued that Ronstadt had the same generational effect with her Great American Songbook music, exposing a whole new generation to the music of the 1920s and 1930smusic which was pushed aside because of the advent of rock 'n' roll. When interpreting, Ronstadt said she \"sticks to what the music demands\", in terms of lyrics. Explaining that rock and roll music is part of her culture, she says that the songs she sang after her rock and roll hits were part of her soul. \"The (Mariachi music) was my father's side of the soul,\" she was quoted as saying in a 1998 interview she gave at her Tucson home. \"My mother's side of my soul was the Nelson Riddle stuff. And I had to do them both in order to reestablish who I was.\"\n\nIn the 1974 book \"Rock 'N' Roll Woman\", author Katherine Orloff writes that Ronstadt's \"own musical preferences run strongly to rhythm and blues, the type of music she most frequently chooses to listen to ... (and) her goal is to ... be soulful too. With this in mind, Ronstadt fuses country and rock into a special union.\"\n\nBy this stage of her career, Ronstadt had established her niche in the field of country-rock. Along with other musicians such as the Flying Burrito Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Gram Parsons, Swampwater, Neil Young, and the Eagles, she helped free country music from stereotypes and showed rockers that country was okay. However, she stated that she was being pushed hard into singing more rock and roll.\n\nAuthor Andrew Greeley, in his book \"God in Popular Culture\", described Ronstadt as \"the most successful and certainly the most durable and most gifted woman Rock singer of her era.\" Signaling her wide popularity as a concert artist, outside of the singles charts and the recording studio, \"Dirty Linen\" magazine describes her as the \"first true woman rock 'n' roll superstar ... (selling) out stadiums with a string of mega-successful albums.\" Amazon.com defines her as \"the\" American female rock superstar of the decade. \"Cashbox\" gave Ronstadt a \"Special Decade Award\", as the top-selling female singer of the 1970s.\n\nHer album covers, posters, magazine coversher entire rock 'n' roll imagewere as famous as her music. By the end of the decade, the singer whom the \"Chicago Sun Times\" described as the \"Dean of the 1970s school of female rock singers\" became what \"Redbook\" called \"the most successful female rock star in the world.\" \"Female\" was the important qualifier, according to \"Time\" magazine, which labeled her \"a rarity ... to (have survived) ... in the shark-infested deeps of rock.\"\n\nAlthough Ronstadt had been a cult favorite on the music scene for several years, 1975 was \"remembered in the music biz as the year when 29-year-old Linda Ronstadt \"belatedly\" happened.\"\n\nWith the release of \"Heart Like a Wheel\"named after one of the album's songs, written by Anna McGarrigleRonstadt reached number 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart; it was also the first of four number 1 Country Albums, and the disc was certified double-platinum (over two million copies sold in the U.S.). In many instances, her own interpretations were more successful than the original recordings, and many times new songwriters were discovered by a larger audience as a result of her interpretation and recording. Ronstadt had major success interpreting songs from a diverse spectrum of artists.\n\n\"Heart Like a Wheel\"s first single release, \"You're No Good\"a rockified version of an R&B song written by Clint Ballard, Jr. that Ronstadt had initially resisted because Andrew Gold's guitar tracks sounded too much like a \"Beatles song\" to herclimbed to number 1 on both the \"Billboard\" and \"Cash Box\" Pop singles charts. The album's second single release, \"When Will I Be Loved\"an uptempo country-rock version of a Top 10 Everly Brothers songhit number 1 in \"Cashbox\" and number 2 in \"Billboard\". The song was also Ronstadt's first number 1 country hit.\n\nThe album showed a physically attractive Ronstadt on the cover but, more importantly, its critical and commercial success was due to a fine presentation of country and rock, with \"Heart Like a Wheel\" her first of many major commercial successes that would set her on the path to being one of the best-selling female artists of all time. Ronstadt won her first Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance/Female for \"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)\" which was originally a 1940s hit by Hank Williams. Ronstadt's interpretation peaked at number 2 on the country chart. The album itself was nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" put Ronstadt on its cover in March 1975. It was the first of six \"Rolling Stone\" covers shot by photographer Annie Leibovitz. It included her as the featured artist with a full photo layout and an article by Ben Fong-Torres, discussing Ronstadt's many struggling years in rock n roll, as well as her home life and what it was like to be a woman on tour in a decidedly all-male environment.\n\nIn September 1975, Ronstadt's album \"Prisoner In Disguise\" was released. It quickly climbed into the Top Five on the \"Billboard\" Album Chart and sold over a million copies. It became her second in a row to go platinum, \"a grand slam\" in the same year (Ronstadt would eventually become the first female artist in popular music history to have three consecutive platinum albums and would ultimately go on to have eight consecutive platinum albums, and then another six between 1983 and 1990). The disc's first single release was \"Love Is A Rose\". It was climbing the pop and country charts but Heat Wave, a rockified version of the 1963 hit by Martha and the Vandellas, was receiving considerable airplay. Asylum pulled the \"Love Is a Rose\" single and issued \"Heat Wave\" with \"Love Is a Rose\" on the B-side. \"Heat Wave\" hit the Top Five on \"Billboard\"s Hot 100 while \"Love Is A Rose\" hit the Top Five on Billboard's country chart.\n\nIn 1976, Ronstadt reached the Top 3 of \"Billboard\"s Album Chart and won her second career Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her third consecutive platinum album \"Hasten Down the Wind\". The album featured a sexy, revealing cover shot and showcased Ronstadt the singer-songwriter, who composed two of its songs, \"Try Me Again\" (co-authored with Andrew Gold) and \"Lo Siento Mi Vida\". It also included an interpretation of Willie Nelson's ballad \"Crazy\", which became a Top 10 Country hit for Ronstadt in early 1977.\n\nAt the end of 1977, Ronstadt surpassed the success of \"Heart Like a Wheel\" with her album \"Simple Dreams\", which held the number 1 position for five consecutive weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. It sold over 3½ million copies in less than a year in the U.S. alone – a record for a female artist. \"Simple Dreams\" spawned a string of hit singles on numerous charts. Among them were the RIAA platinum-certified single \"Blue Bayou\", a country rock interpretation of a Roy Orbison song; \"It's So Easy\"previously sung by Buddy Holly; and \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\", a song written by Warren Zevon, an up-and-coming songwriter of the time. The album garnered several Grammy Award nominationsincluding Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for \"Blue Bayou\"and won its art director, Kosh, a Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, the first of three Grammy Awards he would win for designing Ronstadt album covers.\n\n\"Simple Dreams\" became one of the singer's best-selling international-selling albums as well, reaching number 1 on the Australian and Canadian Pop and Country Albums charts. \"Simple Dreams\" also made Ronstadt the most successful international female touring artist. The same year, she completed a concert tour around Europe. As \"Country Music\" magazine wrote in October 1978, \"Simple Dreams\" solidified Ronstadt's role as \"easily the most successful female rock and roll \"and\" country star at this time.\"\n\nAlso in 1977, she was asked by the Los Angeles Dodgers to sing the U.S. National Anthem at game three of the World Series against the New York Yankees.\n\nRonstadt has remarked that she felt as though she was \"artificially encouraged to kinda cop a really tough attitude (and be tough) because rock and roll is kind of tough (business),\" which she felt wasn't worn quite authentically. Female rock artists like her and Janis Joplin, whom she described as lovely, shy, and very literate in real life and the antithesis of the \"red hot mamma\" she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an identity crisis.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Ronstadt's image became just as famous as her music. In 1976 and 1977, she appeared on the covers of \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Time\", respectively. The \"Rolling Stone\" cover story was accompanied by a series of photographs of Ronstadt in a skimpy red slip, taken by Annie Leibovitz. Ronstadt felt deceived by the photographer, not realizing that the photos would be so revealing. She says her manager Peter Asher kicked Leibovitz out of the house when she visited to show them the photographs prior to publication. Leibovitz had refused to let them veto any of the photos, which included one of Ronstadt sprawled across a bed in her underpants. In a 1977 interview, Ronstadt explained, \"Annie [Leibovitz] saw that picture as an exposé of my personality. She was right. But I wouldn't choose to show a picture like that to anybody who didn't know me personally, because only friends could get the other sides of me in balance.\"\n\nHer 1977 appearance on the cover of \"Time\" magazine under the banner \"Torchy Rock\" was also upsetting to Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock. At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear, Ronstadt hated the image of her that was projected to the world on that cover, and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image she did not want to project. In 2004, she was interviewed for \"CBS This Morning\" and stated that this image was not her because she did not sit like that. Asher noted, \"Anyone who's met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn't possibly have been her Svengali. She's an extremely determined woman, in every area. To me, she was everything that feminism's about.\" Qualities which, Asher has stated, were considered a \"negative (in a woman at that time), whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold\". Since her solo career had begun, Ronstadt had fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock, and her portrayal on the \"Time\" cover did not appear to help the situation.\n\nIn 1978, \"Rolling Stone\" declared Ronstadt \"by far America's best-known female rock singer.\" She scored a third number 1 album on the Billboard Album Chart – at this point equaling the record set by Carole King in 1974 – with \"Living in the USA\". She achieved a major hit single with \"Ooh Baby Baby\", with her rendition hitting all four major singles charts (Pop, AC, Country, R&B). \"Living in the USA\" was the first album by any recording act in music history to ship double-platinum (over 2 million advance copies). The album eventually sold 3 million U.S. copies.\n\nAt the end of that year, \"Billboard\" magazine crowned Ronstadt with three number-one Awards for the Year: Pop Female Singles Artist of the Year, Pop Female Album Artist of the Year, and Female Artist of the Year (overall).\n\n\"Living in the USA\" showed the singer on roller skates with a newly short, permed hairdo on the album cover. Ronstadt continued this theme on concert tour promotional posters with photos of her on roller skates in a dramatic pose with a large American flag in the background. By this stage of her career, she was using posters to promote every album and concert – which at the time were recorded live on radio or television.\n\nRonstadt was also featured in the 1978 film \"FM\", where the plot involved disc jockeys attempting to broadcast a Ronstadt concert live, without a competing station's knowledge. The film also showed Ronstadt performing the songs \"Poor, Poor Pitiful Me\", \"Love Me Tender\", and \"Tumbling Dice\". Ronstadt was persuaded to record \"Tumbling Dice\" after Mick Jagger came backstage when she was at a concert and said, \"You do too many ballads, you should do more rock and roll songs.\"\n\nFollowing the success of \"Living in the USA\", Ronstadt conducted album promotional tours and concerts. She made a guest appearance onstage with the Rolling Stones at the Tucson Community Center on July 21, 1978, in her hometown of Tucson, where she and Jagger sang \"Tumbling Dice\". On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, \"I loved it. I didn't have a trace of stage fright. I'm scared to death all the way through my own shows. But it was too much fun to get scared. He's so silly onstage, he knocks you over. I mean you have to be on your toes or you wind up falling on your face.\"\n\nBy the end of 1978, Ronstadt had solidified her role as one of rock and pop's most successful solo female acts, and owing to her consistent platinum album success, and her ability as the first woman to sell out concerts in arenas and stadiums hosting tens of thousands of fans, Ronstadt became the \"highest paid woman in rock\". She had six platinum-certified albums, three of which were number 1 on the \"Billboard\" album chart, and numerous charted pop singles. In 1978 alone, she made over $12 million (equivalent to $44,000,000 in 2016 dollars) and in the same year her albums sales were reported to be 17 milliongrossing over $60 million (equivalent to a gross of over $220,000,000, in 2016 dollars).\n\nAs \"Rolling Stone\" dubbed her \"Rock's Venus\", her record sales continued to multiply and set records themselves. By 1979, Ronstadt had collected eight gold, six platinum, and four multi-platinum certifications for her albums, an unprecedented feat at the time. Her 1976 \"Greatest Hits\" album would sell consistently for the next 25 years and in 2001 was certified by the RIAA for seven-times platinum (over seven million U.S. copies sold). In 1980, \"Greatest Hits, Volume 2\" was released and certified platinum.\n\nIn 1979, Ronstadt went on an international tour, playing in arenas across Australia to Japan, including the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Australia, and the Budokan in Tokyo. She also participated in a benefit concert for her friend Lowell George, held at The Forum, in Los Angeles.\n\nBy the end of the decade, Ronstadt had outsold her female competition; no other female artist to date had five straight platinum LPs\"Hasten Down the Wind\" and \"Heart Like a Wheel\" among them. \"Us Weekly\" reported in 1978 that Ronstadt, Joni Mitchell, Stevie Nicks, and Carly Simon had become \"The Queens of Rock\" and \"Rock is no longer exclusively male. There is a new royalty ruling today's record charts.\"\n\nShe would go on to parlay her mass commercial appeal with major success in interpreting The Great American Songbookmade famous a generation before by Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgeraldand later the Mexican folk songs of her childhood.\n\nIn 1980, Ronstadt released \"Mad Love\", her seventh consecutive platinum-selling album. It was a straightforward rock and roll album with post-punk, new wave influences, including tracks by songwriters such as Elvis Costello, the Cretones, and musician Mark Goldenberg who played on the record himself.\n\nShe also made the cover of \"Rolling Stone\" for a record-setting sixth time. \"Mad Love\" entered the \"Billboard\" Album Chart in the Top Five its first week (a record at that time) and climbed to the number 3 position. The project continued her streak of Top 10 hits with \"How Do I Make You\", originally recorded by Billy Thermal, and \"Hurt So Bad\", originally a Top 10 hit for Little Anthony & the Imperials. The album earned Ronstadt a 1980 Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female (although she lost to Pat Benatar's \"Crimes of Passion\" album). Benatar praised Ronstadt by stating, \"There are a lot of good female singers around. How could I be the best? Ronstadt is still alive!\"\n\nIn the summer of 1980, Ronstadt began rehearsals for the first of several leads in Broadway musicals. Joseph Papp cast her as the lead in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Pirates of Penzance\", alongside Kevin Kline. She said singing Gilbert and Sullivan was a natural choice for her, since her grandfather Fred Ronstadt was credited with having created Tucson's first orchestra, the \"Club Filarmonico Tucsonense\", and had once created an arrangement of \"The Pirates of Penzance\".\n\n\"The Pirates of Penzance\" opened for a limited engagement in New York City's Central Park, eventually moving its production to Broadway, where it became a hit, running from January 8, 1981, to November 28, 1982. \"Newsweek\" was effusive in its praise: \"... she has not dodged the coloratura demands of her role (and Mabel is one of the most demanding parts in the G&S canon): from her entrance trilling 'Poor Wand'ring One,' it is clear that she is prepared to scale whatever soprano peaks stand in her way.\" Ronstadt co-starred with Kline and Angela Lansbury in the 1983 operetta's film version. Ronstadt received a Golden Globe nomination for the role in the film version. She garnered a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical and \"The Pirates of Penzance\" won several Tony Awards, including a Tony Award for Best Revival.\n\nAs a child, Ronstadt had discovered the opera \"La bohème\" through the silent film with Lillian Gish and was determined to someday play the part of Mimi. When she met the opera superstar Beverly Sills, she was told, \"My dear, \"every\" soprano in the world wants to play Mimi!\" In 1984, Ronstadt was cast in the role at Joseph Papp's Public Theater. However, the production was a critical and commercial disaster, closing after only a few nights.\n\nIn 1982, Ronstadt released the album \"Get Closer\", a primarily rock album with some country and pop music as well. It remains her only album between 1975 and 1990 not to be officially certified platinum. It peaked at number 31 on the \"Billboard\" Album Chart. The release continued her streak of Top 40 hits with \"Get Closer\" and \"I Knew You When\"a 1965 hit by Billy Joe Royalwhile the Jimmy Webb song \"Easy For You To Say\" was a surprise Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit in the spring of 1983. \"Sometimes You Just Can't Win\" was picked up by country radio, and made it to number 27 on that listing. Ronstadt also filmed several music videos for this album which became popular on the fledgling MTV cable channel. The album earned Ronstadt two Grammy Award nominations: one for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female for the title track and another for Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for the album. The artwork won its art director, Kosh, his second Grammy Award for Best Album Package.\n\nAlong with the release of her \"Get Closer\" album, Ronstadt embarked on a North American tour, remaining one of the top rock-concert draws that summer and fall. On November 25, 1982, her \"Happy Thanksgiving Day\" concert was held at the Reunion Arena in Dallas and broadcast live via satellite to NBC radio stations in the United States.\n\nIn 1988, Ronstadt returned to Broadway for a limited-run engagement in the musical show adaptation of her album celebrating her Mexican heritage, \"Canciones De Mi PadreA Romantic Evening in Old Mexico\".\n\nRonstadt has remarked that in the beginning of her career she \"was so focused on folk, rock and country\" that she \"got a bit bored and started to branch out, and ... [has] been doing that ever since.\" By 1983, her estimated worth was over $40 million mostly from records, concerts and merchandising.\n\nRonstadt eventually tired of playing arenas. She had ceased to feel that arenas, where people milled around smoking marijuana cigarettes and drinking beer, were \"appropriate places for music\". She wanted \"angels in the architecture\"a reference to a lyric in the Paul Simon song \"You Can Call Me Al\" from the 1986 album \"Graceland\". (Ronstadt sang harmony with Simon on a different \"Graceland\" track, \"Under African Skies\". The second verse's lyrics pay tribute to Ronstadt: \"Take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona. ...\"). Ronstadt has said she wants to sing in places similar to the theatre of ancient Greece, where the attention is focused on the stage and the performer.\n\nRonstadt's recording output in the 1980s proved to be just as commercially and critically successful as her 1970s recordings. Between 1983 and 1990, Ronstadt scored six additional platinum albums; two are triple platinum (each with over three million U.S. copies sold); one has been certified double platinum (over two million copies sold); and one has earned additional certification as a Gold (over 500,000 U.S. copies sold) double-disc album.\n\nBy recording traditional pop, traditional country and traditional Latin roots Ronstadt resonated with a different fan base and diversified her appeal.\n\nIn 1981, Ronstadt produced and recorded an album pop standards (later marketed in bootleg form) titled \"Keeping Out of Mischief\" with the assistance of producer Jerry Wexler. However, Ronstadt's displeasure with the final result led her, with regrets, to scrap the project. \"Doing that killed me,\" she said in a \"Time\" magazine interview. But the appeal of the album's music had seduced Ronstadt, as she told \"Down Beat\" in April 1985, crediting Wexler for encouraging her. Nonetheless, Ronstadt had to convince her reluctant record company, Elektra, to approve this type of album under her contract.\n\nBy 1983, Ronstadt had enlisted the help of 62-year-old conductor Nelson Riddle. The two embarked on an unorthodox and original approach to rehabilitating the Great American Songbook, recording a trilogy of traditional pop albums: \"What's New\" (1983U.S. 3.7 million as of 2010); \"Lush Life\" (1984U.S. 1.7 million as of 2010); and \"For Sentimental Reasons\" (1986U.S. 1.3 million as of 2010). The three albums have had a combined sales total of nearly seven million copies in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe album design for \"What's New\" by designer Kosh was unlike any of her previous disc covers. It showed Ronstadt in a vintage dress lying on shimmering satin sheets with a Walkman headset. At the time, Ronstadt received some chiding for both the album cover and her venture into what was then considered \"elevator music\" by cynics, but remained determined to record with Riddle, and \"What's New\" became a hit. The album was released in September 1983 and spent 81 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Album Chart and held the number three position for a month and a half (held out of the top spot only by Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" and Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\") and the RIAA certified it triple platinum (over three million copies sold in the U.S. alone). The album earned Ronstadt another Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and critical raves, with \"Time\" magazine calling it \"one of the gutsiest, most unorthodox and unexpected albums of the year.\"\n\nRonstadt faced considerable pressure not to record \"What's New\" or record with Riddle. According to jazz historian Peter Levinson, author of the book \"September in the Raina Biography on Nelson Riddle\", Joe Smith, president of Elektra Records, was terrified that the Riddle album would turn off Ronstadt's rock audience. Ronstadt did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past, however; the video for the title track featured Danny Kortchmar as the old beau that she bumped into during a rainstorm.\n\n\"What's New\" brought Riddle to a younger audience. According to Levinson, \"the younger audience hated what Riddle had done with Frank Sinatra, which in 1983 was considered 'Vintage Pop'\". Working with Ronstadt, Riddle brought his career back into focus in the last three years of his life. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"What's New\" \"isn't the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of the pop, but is ... the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that Beatlemania and the mass marketing of rock LPs for teenagers undid in the mid-60s. ... In the decade prior to Beatlemania, most of the great band singers and crooners of the 40s and 50s codified a half-century of American pop standards on dozens of albums ... many of them now long out-of-print.\" \"What's New\" is the first album by a rock singer to have major commercial success in rehabilitating the Great American Songbook.\n\nIn 1984, Ronstadt and Riddle performed these songs live, in concert halls throughout Australia, Japan, and the United States, including multi-night performances at historic venues Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, and Pine Knob.\n\nIn 2004, Ronstadt released \"Hummin' to Myself\", her album for Verve Records. It was her first foray into traditional jazz since her sessions with Jerry Wexler and her records with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, but this time with an intimate jazz combo. The album was a quiet affair for Ronstadt, giving few interviews and making only one television performance as promotion. It reached number 2 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart but peaked at number 166 on the main Billboard album chart. Not having the mass distribution that Warner Music Group gave her, \"Hummin' To Myself\" had sold over 75,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2010. It also achieved some critical acclaim from the jazz cognoscenti.\n\nIn 1978, Ronstadt, Dolly Parton, and Emmylou Harris, friends and admirers of one another's work (Ronstadt had included a cover of Parton's \"I Will Always Love You\" on \"Prisoner in Disguise\") attempted to collaborate on a \"Trio\" album. Unfortunately, the attempt did not pan out. Ronstadt later remarked that not too many people were in control at the time and everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the recordings were included on the singers' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.\n\nIn January 1986, the three eventually did make their way into the recording studio, where they spent the next several months working. The result, \"Trio\", which they had conceived ten years earlier, was released in March 1987. It was a considerable hit, holding the number 1 position on Billboard's Country Albums chart for five weeks running and hitting the Top 10 on the pop side also. Selling over three million copies in the U.S. and winning them a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, it produced four Top Ten Country singles including \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" which hit number 1. The album was also a nominee for overall Album of the Year, in the company of Michael Jackson, U2, Prince, and Whitney Houston.\n\nIn 1994, the three performers recorded a follow-up to \"Trio\". As was the case with their aborted 1978 effort, conflicting schedules and competing priorities delayed the album's release indefinitely. Ronstadt, who had already paid for studio timeand owed her record company a finished albumremoved Parton's individual tracks at Parton's request, kept Harris's vocals, and produced a number of the recordings, which she subsequently released on her 1995 return to country rock, the album \"Feels Like Home\".\n\nHowever, in 1999, Ronstadt, Parton, and Harris agreed to release the \"Trio II\" album, as was originally recorded in 1994. It included an ethereal cover of Neil Young's \"After The Gold Rush\" which became a popular music video. The effort was certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold) and won them a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for the track. Ronstadt co-produced the album with George Massenburg and the three ladies also received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Country Album.\n\nAt the end of 1987, Ronstadt released \"Canciones de Mi Padre\", an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she has described as \"world class songs\". Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia. Her musical arranger was mariachi musician Rubén Fuentes.\n\nThese \"canciones\" were a big part of Ronstadt's family tradition and musical roots. For example, the history of this album goes back half a century. In January 1946, the University of Arizona published a booklet by Luisa Espinel entitled \"Canciones de mi Padre\". Luisa Espinel, Ronstadt's aunt, was an international singer in the 1920s and 1930s. Espinel's father was Fred Ronstadt, Linda Ronstadt's grandfather, and the songs she had learned, transcribed, and published were some of the ones he had brought with him from Sonora. Ronstadt researched and extracted from the favorites she had learned from her father Gilbert and she called her album by the same name as her aunt's booklet and as a tribute to her father and his family. Though not fully bilingual, she has a fairly good command of the Spanish language, allowing her to sing Latin American songs with little discernible U.S. accent; Ronstadt has often identified herself as Mexican-American. Her formative years were spent with her father's side of the family. In fact, in 1976, Ronstadt had collaborated with her father to write and compose a traditional Mexican folk ballad, \"Lo siento mi vida\"a song that she included in her Grammy Award-winning album \"Hasten Down the Wind\". Also, Ronstadt has credited Mexican singer Lola Beltrán as an influence in her own singing style, and she recalls how a frequent guest to the Ronstadt home, Eduardo \"Lalo\" Guerrero, father of Chicano music, would often serenade her as a child.\n\nThis album won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for Best Mexican-American Performance. The real achievement, however, is the disc's RIAA double-platinum (over two million copies sold in the U.S.) certification, making it the biggest-selling non-English-language album in U.S. music history. Another achievement is that the album and later theatrical stage show served as a benchmark of Latin cultural renaissance in North America.\n\nRonstadt produced and performed a theatrical stage show in concert halls across the U.S. and Latin America to both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences, including on Broadway. She called the stage show by the same name \"Canciones de mi Padre\". These performances were released on DVD. Ronstadt elected to return to the Broadway stage, four years after she performed in \"La bohème\", for a limited-run engagement. PBS's \"Great Performances\" aired the stage show during its annual fund drives and the show was a hit with audiences, earning Ronstadt a Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.\n\nRonstadt later recorded two additional discs of Latin music in the early 1990s; their promotion, like most of her albums in the 1990s, was a quieter affair, where she appeared to do the \"bare minimum\" to promote them. They were not nearly as successful as \"Canciones De Mi Padre\", but were critically acclaimed in some circles. In 1991, she released \"Mas Canciones\", a follow-up to the first \"Canciones\". For this effort she won a Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album. The following year, she stepped outside of the mariachi genre and decided to record well known \"afro-Cuban\" songs. This disc was titled \"Frenesí\". Like her two previous Latin recordings ventures, this third Latin album won Ronstadt another Grammy Award, this time the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album.\n\nIn 1991, Ronstadt acted in the lead role of arch angel San Miguel in \"La Pastorela\", or \"A Shephard's Tale\", a musical filmed at \"San Juan Bautista\". It was written and directed by Luis Valdez. The production was part of the PBS \"Great Performances\" series.\n\nBy the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Riddle and her surprise hit mariachi recordings, Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again. In 1987, she made a return to the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart with \"Somewhere Out There\", which peaked at number 2 in March. Featured in the animated film \"An American Tail\", the sentimental duet with James Ingram was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the Grammy Award for Song of the Year. The song also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling gold single in the U.S.one of the last 45s ever to do so. It was also accompanied by a popular music video. On the heels of this success, Steven Spielberg asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled \"\", which was titled \"Dreams to Dream\". Although \"Dreams to Dream\" failed to achieve the success of \"Somewhere Out There\", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.\n\nIn 1989, Ronstadt released a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. \"Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind\" became one of the singer's most successful albumsin production, arrangements, sales, and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt's tenth Top 10 album on the \"Billboard\" chart, reaching number 7 and being certified triple-platinum (over three million copies sold in the U.S.). The album also received Grammy Award nominations. Ronstadt included New Orleans soul singer Aaron Neville on several of the album's songs.\n\nRonstadt incorporated the sounds of the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir, Tower of Power horns, the Skywalker Symphony, and numerous musicians. It had the duets with Aaron Neville, \"Don't Know Much\" (\"Billboard\" Hot 100 number 2 hit, Christmas 1989) and \"All My Life\" (\"Billboard\" Hot 100 number 11 hit), both of which were long-running number 1 Adult Contemporary hits. The duets earned several Grammy Award nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Ronstadt's last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed \"Don't Know Much\" together on the telecast. (\"Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out of my voice that I can't do by myself\", Ronstadt reflected in 2007. \"I can do things with Aaron that I can't do alone.\")\n\nIn December 1990, she participated in a concert held at the Tokyo Dome to commemorate John Lennon's 50th birthday, and to raise awareness of environmental issues. Other participants included Miles Davis, Lenny Kravitz, Hall & Oates, Natalie Cole, Yoko Ono, and Sean Lennon. An album resulted, titled \"Happy Birthday, John\".\n\nRonstadt released the highly acclaimed \"Winter Light\" album at the end of 1993. It included New Age arrangements such as the lead single \"Heartbeats Accelerating\" as well as the self-penned title track and featured the glass harmonica. It was her first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at number 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995's \"Feels Like Home\" was Ronstadt's much heralded return to country-rock and included her version of Tom Petty's classic hit \"The Waiting\". The single's rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, \"Walk On\", returned Ronstadt to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983. An album track entitled \"The Blue Train\" charted 10 weeks in \"Billboard\"s Adult Contemporary Top 40. This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching number 75. Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog. Ronstadt was nominated for three Lo Nuestro Awards in 1993: Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, Female Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year, and her version of the song \"Perfidia\" was also listed for Tropical/Salsa Song of the Year.\n\nIn 1996, Ronstadt produced \"Dedicated to the One I Love\", an album of classic rock and roll songs reinvented as lullabies. The album reached number 78 in \"Billboard\" and won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children.\n\nIn 1998, Ronstadt released \"We Ran\", her first album in over two years. The album harkened back to Ronstadt's country-rock and folk-rock heyday. She returned to her rock 'n' roll roots with vivid interpretations of songs by Bruce Springsteen, Doc Pomus, Bob Dylan, and John Hiatt. The recording was produced by Glyn Johns. A commercial failure, the album stood at 57,897 copies sold at the time of its deletion in 2008. It is the poorest-selling studio album in Ronstadt's Elektra/Asylum catalog. \"We Ran\" did not chart any singles but it was well received by critics.\n\nDespite the lack of success of \"We Ran\", Ronstadt kept moving towards this adult rock exploration. In the summer of 1999, she released the album \"\", a folk-rock-oriented project with EmmyLou Harris. It earned a nomination for the Grammy Award for the Best Contemporary Folk Album, and made the Top 10 of \"Billboard\"s Country Albums chart. Still in print as of December 2016, it has sold 223,255 copies per Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nAlso in 1999, Ronstadt went back to her concert roots, when she performed with the Eagles and Jackson Browne at Staples Center's 1999 New Year's Eve celebration kicking off the December 31 end-of-the-millennium festivities. As Staples Center Senior Vice President and General Manager Bobby Goldwater said, \"It was our goal to present a spectacular event as a sendoff to the 20th century\", and \"Eagles, Jackson Browne, and Linda Ronstadt are three of the most popular acts of the century. Their performances will constitute a singular and historic night of entertainment for New Year's Eve in Los Angeles.\"\n\nIn 2000, Ronstadt completed her long contractual relationship with the Elektra/Asylum label. The fulfillment of this contract commenced with the release of \"A Merry Little Christmas\", her first holiday collection, which includes rare choral works, the somber Joni Mitchell song \"River\", and a rare recorded duet with the late Rosemary Clooney on Clooney's signature song, \"White Christmas\".\n\nSince leaving Warner Music, Ronstadt has gone on to release one album each under Verve and Vanguard Records.\n\nIn 2006, recording as the ZoZo Sisters, Ronstadt teamed with her new friend, musician and musical scholar Ann Savoy, to record \"Adieu False Heart\". It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early-20th-century music and released on the Vanguard Records label. But \"Adieu False Heart\" was a commercial failure, peaking at number 146 in the U.S. despite her touring for the final time that year. It was the last time Linda Ronstadt would record an album, having begun to lose her singing ability as the result of Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in December 2012. \"Adieu False Heart\", recorded in Louisiana, features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of the Red Stick Ramblers, Sam Broussard of the Mamou Playboys, Dirk Powell, and Joel Savoy, as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler Stuart Duncan, mandolinist Sam Bush, and guitarist Bryan Sutton. The recording earned two Grammy Award nominations: Best Traditional Folk Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.\n\nIn 2007, Ronstadt contributed to the compilation album \"\"a tribute album to jazz music's all-time most heralded artiston the track \"Miss Otis Regrets\".\n\nIn August 2007, Ronstadt headlined the Newport Folk Festival, making her debut at this event, where she incorporated jazz, rock, and folk music into her repertoire. It was one of her final concerts.\n\nIn 2010, Ronstadt contributed the arrangement and lead vocal to \"A La Orilla de un Palmar\" on the Chieftains' studio album \"San Patricio\" (with Ry Cooder). This remains her most recent commercially available recording as lead vocalist.\n\nIn 2011, Ronstadt was interviewed by the \"Arizona Daily Star\" and announced her retirement. In August 2013, she revealed to AARP that she has Parkinson's disease and \"can no longer sing a note.\"\n\nOn April 10, 2014, Linda Ronstadt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nAs of 2018, Ronstadt has earned three number 1 pop albums, 10 top-ten pop albums and 38 charting pop albums on the \"Billboard\" Pop Album Charts. She has 15 albums on the \"Billboard\" Top Country Albums chart, including four that hit number 1. Ronstadt's singles have earned her a number 1 hit and three number 2 hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, with 10 top-ten pop singles and 21 reaching the Top 40. She has also scored two number 1 hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart, and two number 1 hits and on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart. \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, a whole generation \"but for her, might never have heard the work of Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, or Elvis Costello.\"\n\nShe has recorded and released over 30 studio albums and has made guest appearances on an estimated 120 albums by other artists. Her guest appearances included the classical minimalist Philip Glass's album \"Songs from Liquid Days\", a hit classical record with other major pop stars either singing or writing lyrics. She also appeared on Glass's follow-up recording \"1000 Airplanes on the Roof\". She appeared on Paul Simon's \"Graceland\", where she sang second voice on a song of Simon's called \"Under African Skies.\" In that song, there is a verse dedicated to Ronstadt, to her amazing voice and harmonies and her birth in Tucson, Arizona. She voiced herself in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Mr. Plow\" and sang a duet, \"Funny How Time Slips Away,\" with Homer Simpson on \"The Yellow Album\". Ronstadt has also recorded albums with Billy Eckstine, Emmylou Harris, the Chieftains, Dolly Parton, Neil Young, J. D. Souther, Gram Parsons, Bette Midler, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Earl Scruggs, the Eagles, Andrew Gold, Wendy Waldman, Hoyt Axton, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Ann Savoy, Karla Bonoff, James Taylor, Valerie Carter, Warren Zevon, Maria Muldaur, Randy Newman, Nicolette Larson, the Seldom Scene, Rosemary Clooney, Aaron Neville, Rodney Crowell, Hearts and Flowers, Laurie Lewis and Flaco Jiménez. As a singer-songwriter, Ronstadt has written songs covered by several artists, such as \"Try Me Again\", covered by Trisha Yearwood; and \"Winter Light\", which was co-written and composed with Zbigniew Preisner and Eric Kaz, and covered by Sarah Brightman.\n\nHer three biggest-selling studio albums to date are her 1977 release \"Simple Dreams\", 1983's \"What's New\" and 1989's \"Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind. E\"ach one has been certified by the Recording Industry Association of America for over three million copies sold. Her highest-selling album to date is the 1976 compilation \"Greatest Hits\", certified for over seven million units sold in 2001. Ronstadt became music's first major touring female artist to sell out sizeable venues; she was also the top-grossing solo female concert artist for the 1970s. She remained a highly successful touring artist into the 1990s, at which time she decided to scale back to smaller venues. In the 1970s, \"Cashbox\" magazine, a competitor of \"Billboard\" during that time period, named Ronstadt the \"#1 Female Artist of the Decade\". \"Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" included \"Heart Like a Wheel\" (1974) at number 164 and \"The Very Best Of Linda Ronstadt\" (2002) at number 324. The 2012 revision kept only the compilation, but raised it to the place once occupied by \"Heart Like a Wheel\".\n\nRonstadt's album sales have not been certified since 2001. At that time, Ronstadt's U.S. album sales were certified by the Recording Industry Association of America at over 30 million albums sold; however, Peter Asher, her former producer and manager, placed her total U.S. album sales at over 45 million. Likewise, her worldwide albums sales are in excess of 100 million albums sold, according to the former president of Warner Bros. Records, Joe Smith, now a jury member of the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. Her RIAA certification (audits paid for by record companies or artists for promotion) tally as of 2001 totaled 19 Gold, 14 Platinum and 7 Multi-Platinum albums. She was the first female in music history to score three consecutive platinum albums and ultimately racked up a total of eight consecutive platinum albums. Her album \"Living in the USA\" was the first album by any recording artist in U.S. music history to ship double platinum (over two million advanced copies). Her first Latin release, the all-Spanish 1987 album \"Canciones De Mi Padre\", stands as the best-selling non-English-language album in American music history. As of 2013, it had sold over 2½ million U.S. copies.\n\nRonstadt has served as producer on albums from various musicians that include her cousin, David Lindley, Aaron Neville and singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb. She produced \"Cristal – Glass Music Through the Ages\", an album of classical music using glass instruments with Dennis James, where she sang on several of the arrangements. In 1999, Ronstadt also produced the Grammy Award-winning \"Trio II\". She has received a total of 27 Grammy Award nominations in various fields that include rock, country, pop and Tropical Latin, and has won 11 Grammy Awards in the categories of Pop, Country, Tropical Latin, Musical Album for Children and Mexican-American. In 2016, Ronstadt was again honored by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy.\n\nShe was the first female solo artist to have two Top 40 singles simultaneously on \"Billboard\" magazine's Hot 100: \"Blue Bayou\" and \"It's So Easy\" (October 1977). By December of that year, both \"Blue Bayou\" and \"It's So Easy\" had climbed into \"Billboard\"s Top 5 and remained there for the entire month. In 1999, Ronstadt ranked number 21 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Women of Rock & Roll\". Three years later, she ranked number 40 in CMT's \"40 Greatest Women in Country Music\".\n\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, Ronstadt's private life became increasingly public. It was fueled by a relationship with then-Governor of California Jerry Brown, a Democratic presidential candidate. They shared a \"Newsweek\" magazine cover in April 1979, as well as the covers of \"Us Weekly\" and \"People\" magazine.\n\nIn 1983, Linda Ronstadt dated comedian Jim Carrey for 8 months. In the mid-1980s, Ronstadt was engaged to \"Star Wars\" director George Lucas.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ronstadt was criticized by music critics for playing concerts in South Africa under apartheid. She was listed by the U.N. as supporting apartheid by performing there. At the time, she stated, \"The last place for a boycott is in the arts\", and, \"I don't like being told I can't go somewhere.\"\n\nIn December 1990, she adopted an infant daughter, Mary Clementine. In 1994, she adopted a baby boy, Carlos Ronstadt. Ronstadt has never married. Speaking of finding an acceptable mate, in 1974 she told Peter Knobler in \"Crawdaddy\", \"... he's real kind but isn't inspired musically, and then you meet somebody else that's just so inspired musically that he just takes your breath away, but he's such a moron, such a maniac that you can't get along with him. And then after that it's the problem of finding someone that can stand you!\"\n\nAfter living in Los Angeles for 30 years, Ronstadt moved to San Francisco because she said she never felt at home in Southern California. \"Los Angeles became too enclosing an environment\", she says. \"I couldn't breathe the air, and I didn't want to drive on the freeways to get to the studio. I also didn't want to embrace the values that have been so completely embraced by that city. Are you glamorous? Are you rich? Are you important? Do you have clout? It's just not me, and it never was me.\" In 1997, Ronstadt sold her home in San Francisco and moved back to her hometown of Tucson, Arizona, to raise her two children. In more recent years, Ronstadt moved back to San Francisco while continuing to maintain her home in Tucson.\n\nIn 2009, in honor of Ronstadt, the Martin Guitar Company made a 0042 model \"Linda Ronstadt Limited Edition\" acoustic guitar. Ronstadt appointed the Land Institute as recipient of all proceeds from her signature guitar.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Simon & Schuster announced their publishing of Ronstadt's autobiography. \"Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir\", and the Spanish version \"Sueños SencillosMemorias Musicales\" was released on September 17, 2013.\n\nIn August 2013, Ronstadt revealed she has Parkinson's disease, leaving her unable to sing due to loss of muscular control, which is common to Parkinson's patients. She was diagnosed eight months prior to the announcement and had initially attributed the symptoms she had been experiencing to the aftereffects of shoulder surgery and a tick bite.\n\nRonstadt describes herself as a \"spiritual atheist\".\n\nRonstadt's politics received criticism and praise during and after her July 17, 2004, performance at the Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts in Las Vegas. Toward the end of the show, as she had done across the country, Ronstadt spoke to the audience, praising \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", Michael Moore's documentary film about the Iraq War; she dedicated the song \"Desperado\" to Moore. Accounts say the crowd's initial reaction was mixed, with \"half the crowd heartily applauding her praise for Moore, (and) the other half booing.\"\n\nFollowing the concert, news accounts reported that Ronstadt was \"evicted\" from the hotel premises. Ronstadt's comments, as well as the reactions of some audience members and the hotel, became a topic of discussion nationwide. Aladdin casino president Bill Timmins and Michael Moore each made public statements on the controversy.\n\nThe incident prompted international headlines and debate on an entertainer's right to express a political opinion from the stage and made the editorial section of \"The New York Times\". Following the incident, many friends of Ronstadt's, including the Eagles, immediately cancelled their engagements at the Aladdin. Ronstadt also received telegrams of support from her rock 'n' roll friends around the world, such as the Rolling Stones, the Eagles, and Elton John. Amid reports of mixed public response, Ronstadt continued in her praise of Moore and his film throughout her 2004 and 2006 summer concerts across North America.\n\nAt a 2006 concert in Canada, Ronstadt told the \"Calgary Sun\" that she was \"embarrassed George Bush (was) from the United States. ... He's an idiot. ... He's enormously incompetent on both the domestic and international scenes. ... Now the fact that we were lied to about the reasons for entering into war against Iraq and thousands of people have diedit's just as immoral as racism.\" Her remarks drew international headlines. In an August 14, 2007, interview, she commented on all her well-publicized, outspoken views, in particular the Aladdin incident, by noting, \"If I had it to do over I would be much more gracious to everyone ... you can be as outspoken as you want if you are very, very respectful. Show some grace\".\n\nIn August 2009, Ronstadt, in a well-publicized interview to PlanetOut Inc. titled \"Linda Ronstadt's Gay Mission\", championed gay rights and same-sex marriage, and stated that \"homophobia is anti-family values. Period, end of story.\"\n\nOn January 16, 2010, Ronstadt converged with thousands of other activists in a \"National Day of Action\". Ronstadt stated that her \"dog in the fight\"as a native Arizonan and coming from a law enforcement familywas the treatment of illegal aliens and Arizona's enforcement of its illegal immigrant law, especially Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's immigration efforts.\n\nOn April 29, 2010, Ronstadt began a campaign, including joining a lawsuit, against Arizona's new illegal-immigration law SB 1070 calling it a \"devastating blow to law enforcement ... the police don't protect us in a democracy with brute force\", something she said she learned from her brother, Peter, who was Chief of Police in Tucson.\n\nRonstadt has also been outspoken on environmental and community issues. She is a major supporter and admirer of sustainable agriculture pioneer Wes Jackson, saying in 2000, \"the work he's doing right now is the most important work there is in the (United States)\", and dedicating the rock anthem \"Desperado\" to him at an August 2007 concert in Kansas City, Kansas.\n\nIn 2007, Ronstadt resided in San Francisco while also maintaining her home in Tucson. That same year, she drew criticism and praise from Tucsonans for commenting that the local city council's failings, developers' strip mall mentality, greed, and growing dust problem had rendered the city unrecognizable and poorly developed.\n\nIn 2008, Ronstadt was appointed \"Artistic Director\" of the San José Mariachi and Mexican Heritage Festival. On March 31, 2009, in testimony that the \"Los Angeles Times\" termed \"remarkable\", Ronstadt spoke to the United States Congress House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment & Related Agencies, attempting to convince lawmakers to budget $200 million in the 2010 fiscal year for the National Endowment of the Arts.\n\nRonstadt has also been honored for her contribution to the American arts. On September 23, 2007, she was inducted into the Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame, along with Stevie Nicks, Buck Owens, and filmmaker Steven Spielberg. On August 17, 2008, Ronstadt received a \"tribute\" by various artists, including BeBe Winans and Wynonna Judd, when she was honored with the \"Trailblazer Award\", presented to her by Plácido Domingo at the 2008 ALMA Awards, a ceremony later televised in the U.S. on ABC.\n\nIn May 2009, Ronstadt received an honorary doctorate of music degree from the Berklee College of Music for her achievements and influence in music and her contributions to American and international culture. \"Mix\" magazine stated that \"Linda Ronstadt (has) left her mark on more than the record business; her devotion to the craft of singing influenced many audio professionals ... (and is) intensely knowledgeable about the mechanics of singing and the cultural contexts of every genre she passes\".\n\nIn 2004, Ronstadt wrote the foreword to the book \"The NPR Curious Listener's Guide to American Folk Music\", and in 2005, she wrote the introduction to the book \"Classic Ferrington Guitars\", about guitar-maker and luthier Danny Ferrington and the custom guitars that he created for Ronstadt and other musicians such as Elvis Costello, Ry Cooder, and Kurt Cobain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some eight million German immigrants have entered the United States since that point. Immigration continued in substantial numbers during the 19th century; the largest number of arrivals moved 1840–1900, when Germans formed the largest group of immigrants coming to the U.S., outnumbering the Irish and English. Some arrived seeking religious or political freedom, others for economic opportunities greater than those in Europe, and others for the chance to start afresh in the New World. California and Pennsylvania have the largest populations of German origin, with more than six million German Americans residing in the two states alone.

All the subordinate chiefs in Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique come to Katete at Mkaika to pay their tributes and join in the celebrations with their people.\n\nThe ceremony, held after harvest in late August, is a way of bringing together different Chewa chiefs from the three countries to present their reports of grievances to paramount chief Kalonga Gawa Undi. The name Kalonga means the one who installs subordinate chiefs. Gawa is the one who gives out land and Undi means the one who protects the subordinates. The Kalonga Gawa Undi is head of all the Chewa chiefdoms and takes care of all the installations of chiefs not only in Zambia but in Malawi and Mozambique as well.\n\nThe ceremony was banned by the colonial masters in 1934 but paramount chief Kalonga Gawa Undi Chivunga revived the ceremony in 1984. Since then it has been an annual event. On the day of the ceremony, the center of attraction is the main area where all the dignitaries are seated. The entrance of paramount chief Kalonga Gawa Undi into the arena signifies the start of the ceremony. Visitors from Zambia and Chewa's from neighboring Malawi and Mozambique are entertained to a variety of dances that are from three countries.\n\nA variety of dances like Gule Wamukulu (Nyau), Gologolo, Makanja, Muganda, Chinamwali, Chimtali (the female dance) and many others are performed during the ceremony. The Nyau or popularly known as the Gule Wamukulu among locals, is the most celebrated dance among the Chewa people.\n\nThe Nyau dance (Gule Wamukulu) was officially recognized by UNESCO in 2006. Nyau dancers are referred to as Vilombo (animals) in Chewa, believed to emanate from dead spirits. There are a lot of Nyau dances at any ceremony. The type of the dance depends to a larger extent on the nature of the occasion. More than 30 different Nyau dances are performed at a single festival with each dancer adorning a different mask in an array of colors.\n\nSome of the Nyau masks are a reflection of human behavior in true life. The people can tell the type of Nyau entertaining them through its dress or mask. Some Nyau are frightening while others are fun.\n\nAlso part of the Kulamba ceremony is an annual initiation ceremony for the young girls who have come of age. The ?anamwali? or young girls have been in confinement where they have spent time being taught skills and responsibilities of womanhood.\n\nKulamba ceremony is proving to be a big annual event, bringing together chiefs from 137 chiefdoms in Malawi, 33 in Mozambique and 42 in Zambia. The significance of this is its ability to bring Chewa under different chiefdoms and countries to Mkaika, capital of the Chewa and palace of paramount chief Kalonga Gawa Undi, to celebrate these festivals together regardless of today?s political boundaries.\n\nOther notable traditional leaders include:\n\n\nDominic Changwe→\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a list of deceased historical figures (or sub-lists of them) in Zambia and its antecedent territories, and combines Zambians, Africans and non-Zambians including British people and Northern Rhodesians.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48836874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48836874", "title": "Luis de Llauder y Dalmases", "text": "Luis de Llauder y Dalmases\n\nLuis Gonzaga María Antonio Carlos Ramón Miguel de Llauder y de Dalmases, de Freixas, de Bufalá y de Camín, 1st marquis of Vallteix (1837–1902) was a Spanish Catholic publisher and a Carlist politician. He is known as leader of Catalan Carlism of the late nineteenth century. He is also recognized as founder and the moving spirit behind Barcelona-based Catholic media initiatives, especially a publishing house, a daily \"\", and a weekly \"\".\n\nThe Llauders were first recorded in the late 15th century, its representatives noted as blacksmiths based in the Catalan town of Argentona. In course of the next two centuries the family grew into prominence and wealth, accumulating a number of estates in Mataró and Barcelona; since mid-17th century its senior was honorary citizen of the Catalan capital. In the late 18th century the family built an iconic Mataró mansion known as and kept living there interchanging with the residence at intersection of the Hèrcules and Arlet streets in Barcelona. Luis' great-grandfather, José Antonio Llauder y Duran, commenced industrial activities upon receiving concession to exploit water springs; despite damages suffered during the Peninsular War, the business was developed further on by his son José Francisco Llauder y Camín, who died in 1824 already as the first taxpayer of Mataró.\n\nJosé Francisco's son and the father of Luis, Ramón de Llauder y Freixes (1807–1870), inherited the family wealth and prestige. He fell in love with María Mercedes de Dalmases y de Bufalà (died 1885), also a Catalan native of Sant Martí Sesgueioles, descendant to a wealthy bourgeoisie family. The couple married in 1837 and initially settled in Madrid, but they soon moved to the Llauder residence in Barcelona; Ramon remained the first taxpayer of Mataró. Apart from integration and further development of the family businesses, he made his name as a lawyer and became member of Tribunal Supremo. He is known as a fervent Catholic who donated large sums to the Church, including financing of a newly set up Poor Clares convent. Ramon demonstrated interest in charity, further developed also by Luis, e.g. founding and financing a school for the poor.\n\nRamon and María had 6 children, except Luis all of them daughters; they were brought up in fervently Catholic ambience. One of them, Pilar, became nun of the Handmaids of the Sacred Heart of Jesus order. It is not clear where the young Luis received his schooling; he obtained bachillerato in 1851. He then enrolled at the Civil and Canon law faculty of the Universitat de Barcelona, graduating as licenciado in 1858; one source claims he received technical education and graduated as engineer. As he inherited a real estate fortune and the industry enterprises, it is not clear whether he has ever practiced as a lawyer. He has never married and had no children. A little known poet of the early 20th century, Lorenzo de Llauder y de Bonilla, was his distant relative.\n\nThere is little information on Llauder's public activity in the 1860s. He was certainly active in various Catholic groupings; having inherited from his father vivid interest in social issues and a penchant for charity, in 1863 he was acknowledged as engaged in Caridad Cristiana, a Barcelona philanthropic institution specializing in education; in the early 1864 he rose to deputy treasurer of the organization. Llauder was also noted as active in regional realm in-between economy and public management: in 1865 he was secretary of comisión organizadora preparing an agricultural exposition in Mataró; within this body he represented the proprietors. There is a source which claims that in his youth he practiced as a lawyer, though the information is not confirmed elsewhere. He was probably engaged also in the family business; at unspecified time and under his guidance the number of family operated watermills rose from 2 to 5; he also upgraded some of them by mounting auxiliary steam engines.\n\nIt is not clear when Llauder commenced his lifelong career of a publisher and a journalist. One author maintains that it was \"shortly after\" graduation when he tried his hand in letters, starting co-operation with local periodicals. The first titles named are popular Catholic reviews \"La Sociedad Católica\", \"El Amigo del Pueblo\" and \"El Criterio Católico\", and the time is specified as \"second half of the 1860s\". It seems that at that time he was formatted as a militant Catholic author rather than a partisan of any specific party. His opinion on politics of the era, especially on the crumbling rule of Isabel II, is not known. It was only the Glorious Revolution of 1868 and declaration of the First Spanish Republic that triggered Llauder's political career.\n\nThere were no known Carlist antecedents in Llauder's family. Political views of his father are unclear, while his paternal uncle, Carlos de Llauder y Freixes, was well established in the Isabelline system as a Partido Moderado politician and a Cortes deputy. It was rather the brother of his paternal grandfather, , who gained nationwide recognition as a Carlist foe; when capitán general of Catalonia he made his name for engineering anti-Carlist repressions during and after the First Carlist War. Hence, it is not clear how Llauder approached the Carlists in the late 1860s. Later party propaganda claimed that it was his bright intelligence that made him conclude, somewhat against the family background, that Traditionalism was the only way forward. This became evident in his 1869 booklet, \"El desenlace de la revolución españoIa\". The work compared regimes of liberal monarchy, republic and traditionalist monarchy. Stemming mostly from Catholic principles, it declared Traditionalism the only viable option, advocating leadership of the Carlist claimant Carlos VII. \"Desenlace\" was focused on politics; the work by no means endorsed violence, the position that Llauder was to maintain through all later life. According to his own later accounts, the book was the first attempt \"to fly the Carlist standard in Catalonia\" during the Sexenio Democrático.\n\n\"Desenlace\" earned Llauder his name in Catalan public discourse. He was welcomed in Asociación Católico-Monárquica, an agglutinatory force attracting far-Right opposition. The formation was an alliance of , Conservatives and Carlists; though Llauder's non-belligerent stance was similar to that of the neos, a contemporary scholar clearly identifies him as a Carlist. In the supplementary 1870 elections to Cortes Constituentes Llauder appeared on candidatura católico-monárquica in his native district of Vich. When elected he joined the 23-member Carlist minority. In the successive 1871 campaign he ran on the same ticket from Berga, elected with 97% of all votes cast. In the spring of 1872 he again stood in Berga; though initially reported victorious, in unclear circumstances he was finally declared defeated.\n\nIn the early 1870s Llauder's career of a publisher was already in full swing. Around 1870 he founded with his own money a Barcelona-based daily \"La Convicción\", acting also as a manager and editor-in-chief until the title was closed in 1873. Though the paper demonstrated clear Traditionalist leaning, its political strategy appear confusing. On the one hand Llauder demonstrated much flexibility. In 1871 he advocated alliance of all opposition groupings; the call raised eyebrows of those - like - who were surprised at having been encouraged to join ranks with the radical republicans. On the other hand, Llauder demonstrated a doctrinaire position when lambasting the neo-Catholic by calling him a liberal disciple of Chateaubriand. Scholars present different views on Llauder's position versus amalgamation with the neo-Catholics; some claim he opposed it and some claim he himself approached them. At that time he was already considered \"prestigioso periodista\".\n\nShortly before outbreak of the Third Carlist War Llauder was an eminent party figure in Catalonia, rising to presidency of the Barcelona Ateneo Católico-monárquica and Junta Provincial Católico-monárquica. Since 1870 he was living intermittently in Spain and abroad, mostly in the Swiss Vevey, where he accompanied the claimant and his brother Don Alfonso Carlos. At the outbreak of hostilities as a renowned propagandist he felt endangered by republican militants and did not return to Spain. His exact war record is not clear, though he probably did not take part in hostilities. At least temporarily he accompanied Carlos VII in Gipuzkoa; in mid-1873 the press reported him as nominated secretary to Alfonso Carlos, though later he was noted as resident in the French Prats-de-Mollo, active within a group of recovering Carlist combatants. No further information is available; one scholar summarizes his contribution to the Carlist war effort as \"modestíssima\".\n\nFollowing the Carlist defeat Llauder did not return to Spain. In 1876 the claimant nominated him secretary to Junta de Generales, a rather ineffective makeshift Carlist executive set up by Carlos VII prior to his departure to America. Some sources claim that until 1878 he permanently resided in Rome, acting as sort of a Carlist diplomatic envoy to Vatican, though contemporary press noticed his taking part in the 1877 pilgrimage to Zaragoza.\n\nBack in Spain Llauder resumed public activity in the Carlist realm. It was very much pursued along the lines set up by , who intended to format the party as focused on religious issues and vehemently opposed to the emerging Restauración regime. Already shortly after the military defeat Llauder joined Nocedal in a plot, aimed against Junta de Generales, and served as liaison with a number of distinguished Carlist figures. Once Nocedal was appointed the official jefe delegado in 1879, Llauder emerged as top Catalan exponent of his political line, known as Integrism. Since key nocedalista means of mobilization were public events styled as Catholic feasts, especially pilgrimages, in 1879 Llauder became member of Junta Directiva organizing another massive excursion to Rome. As initial plan did not work out, in 1882 he headed Barcelona branch of junta organizadora engineering the next attempt, and once political nature of the enterprise became evident, he was confronted by the Barcelona bishop .\n\nNocedal and his followers envisioned Carlism as a loose movement, its direction set by a wide range of publications; in 1875 in Madrid they founded a daily which was to become an icon of Traditionalist press, \"El Siglo Futuro\". Llauder followed suit in Barcelona, where in 1878 he took over \"Correo Catalán\". \"Correo\" started to serve as the principal Integrist tribune in Catalonia; it published articles of key Catholic intransigents like Félix Sardà y Salvany, joined \"El Siglo Futuro\" in war against other Carlist publications like \"Le Fé\", representing competitive religious and political vision, and co-engineered campaign against the , who decided to join political structures of the regime. His belligerency cost Llauder legal action and incarceration sentence; \"Correo\", suspended for 45 days, was at that time replaced by ephemeral \"El Noticiero\". Soon Llauder threw himself into publishing activity altogether: in 1883 he set up an intransigent Catholic weekly, in 1885 he opened a bookstore, and in 1887 he complemented the business by founding a publishing house, all named \"La Hormiga de Oro\".\n\nIn the mid-1880s Llauder seemed fully aligned with the Integrist vision and its key components: intransigent Catholicism, political abstention, and Carlism understood primarily as a platform of religious mobilization. He self-declared himself an Integrist, writing with pride that \"only a small group of faithful disciples followed the Church [...]. This group was called integristas, intransigentes or tradicionalistas\". He took part in number of formal Integrist-defined and Integrist-named public initiatives, let alone co-operation between \"Correo Catalán\" and \"El Siglo Futuro\", his daily representing an exclusivist, hard-line, machamartillo format of religiosity. By scholars he is clearly considered as \"member of the Integrist sector of the party\". However, apart from continuing \"guerra periodistica\", Llauder is not recognized for confronting the competitive group, led by marqués de Cerralbo and known as aperturistas, and is not considered protagonist of increasingly bitter strife between the warring factions.\n\nIn early 1888 the claimant invited Llauder to his Venice residence and asked to prepare a publication which would clarify the official royal position. His personal choice might have seemed surprising given Llauder's role in Integrism, as Nocedal's son Ramón clearly aimed at reducing the claimant to a decorative role. Some scholars claim that Carlos VII picked Llauder considering him an in-between person who would act as mediator between the two factions. Other students suggest that the Carlist king intended to outplay the Nocedalistas by luring into his camp one of their politicians, and that choosing Llauder was a smart deceiving move.\n\nThe publication took shape of a March 1888 article in \"Correo Catalán\", titled \"El Pensamiento del Duque de Madrid\"; it was styled as an interview with the claimant. Apart from doctrinal issues it urged moderation, respect for other Traditionalists and stated that no daily could speak for the king. Instead of reconciliation, it led to escalation; Nocedal and his supporters left Carlism and set up their own party. Though the breakup did not have a major effect on the rank-and-file, it devastated Carlist network of periodicals; most editorial boards decided to side with the secessionists. Llauder's position came as a surprise: for 10 years one of the most prestigious Nocedals' supporters, he decided not to join them and to stand by his king.\n\nLlauder's motives are not entirely clear; it seems that out of two features constituting his previous position, the Integrist outlook and the loyalty to Carlist dynasty, the latter prevailed. His stand came as a nasty surprise for the Nocedalistas, who declared Llauder a traitor. When striking back he played down ideological differences and tended to define the conflict as result of overgrown personal ambitions of Nocedal. Also in case of Sarda Llauder confirmed validity of his works, noting that the author took unduly advantage of his prestige. In general, he tended to approach the Integrists as a sick branch of a healthy tree and later tried to exercise some moderating influence; following clashes in the in 1889 he criticized Carlists taking part and demanded they do not respond to provocations.\n\nAs the breakaway Nocedalistas controlled \"El Siglo Futuro\", previously the national party mouthpiece, Carlos VII decided to set a new semi-official Carlist newspaper; this role was entrusted to Llauder, who in 1888–1889 moved to Madrid. Initially to be named \"El Estandarte Real\", the daily materialized in 1888 as \"El Correo Español\", largely modeled on \"Correo Catalán\" and by some considered its \"brother newspaper\". Following successful launch, in 1889 Llauder transferred ownership to the claimant, ceded management to Leandro Herrero and moved back to Barcelona. According to some, it was Llauder who offered job in the editorial board to Juan Vázquez de Mella. Though in the early 1890s some suggested that Llauder takes back leadership of the newspaper, suffering from capricious de Mella's management, the daily proved a lasting enterprise and closed as late as 1922.\n\nThe new party leader de Cerralbo pursued his own vision of Carlism, focused on organizational build-up. Its initial embodiment were structures officially created to co-ordinate Carlist celebrations of the so-called ; in 1889 Llauder was nominated Catalan representative in Junta Central and head of Catalan Junta Regional. Though the nomination was protested by those who remembered his anti-belligerent stand in the 1870s and those who resented his alliance with the Integros in the 1880s, in 1890 Llauder was confirmed as President of new official Junta Regional Carlista.\n\nIn Catalonia Llauder presided over transformation of Carlism from a loose movement into a modern and efficient party. In line with Cerralbo's strategy he worked towards setting local structures, encouraging new juntas whenever possible. He proved very efficient: in 1892 Catalonia boasted 43 circulos out of 102 existing in Spain; in 1896 the number grew to 100 out of 298, with Barcelona province leading the way with 46 circulos. According to Llauder himself, along Navarre the countryside of muntanya catalana turned the very heartland of Spanish Carlism. First Juventud section, a new juvenile branch, was created in Barcelona in 1894.\n\nThough in general he remained antiparliamentarian and considered elections a secondary issue, sort of front cover-up for Liberal backstage rule, he engaged in Carlist electoral effort, resumed by de Cerralbo for the first time in the 1891 campaign. When acknowledging rather poor results at the pools in 1891 (2 MPs), 1896 (2) and 1898 (2), let alone the disastrous 1893 campaign (no mandate), he noted it would have been absurd to conclude that Carlism enjoyed so limited support, blaming fraud for the poor showing. Himself he stood in his old constituency of Berga and was successful in 1891, but lost in 1893. In 1896 he successfully ran for Senate from Girona, but on the claimant's order he refused to take oath and signed \"Manifiesto de las minorias carlistas\"; by some sources he is not listed as a senator.\n\nDuring his 14-year leadership of Catalan Carlism Llauder emerged as one of key party heavyweights of the late 19th century. He is considered principal agent of \"carlismo nuevo\" in the region; Catalonia was the first stage of innovative Cerralbo's tours across the country and Llauder worked hand-in-hand with jefe delegado to implement new peaceful strategy and defuse conspiracy which aimed at renewing violence. He hugely contributed to smooth recovery of Catalan Carlism from the Nocedalista crisis; though Llauder had to cope with internal conflict; he played vital role in party consolidation of the 1890. His 1897 contribution to Acta de Loredan became last Llauder's major public engagement; starting 1898 due to rapidly deteriorating health he was spending long periods in the spa of and his regional leadership became largely theoretical. In 1898 the claimant declared him marqués de Vallteix. No scholar mentions Llauder discussing , which suggests that shortly before death - still official jefe - he already played no major role in politics.\n\nThough he owned, managed and edited a number of periodicals, including \"La Convicción\" in 1870–1873 and \"El Correo Español\" in 1888–1889, as a publisher Llauder is first and foremost recognized as the moving spirit behind two enterprises which turned into monumental periodical prints in Catalonia, the daily \"Correo Catalán\" and the weekly \"La Hormiga de Oro\"; both issued for more than half a century, both outlived him by 34 years.\n\n\"Correo Catalán\", started in 1876, was taken over by Llauder in 1878. Unlike \"Correo Español\", launched with official party finances, \"Correo Catalán\" was Llauder's private property. He remained also chief editor of the daily, formatted as continuation of \"La Convicción\". During the first decade it followed the Integrist line of Nocedal and Sarda; though after 1888 the daily remained within mainstream Traditionalism, it very much kept pursuing the same intransigent Catholic line. \"Correo\" remained a semi-official party paper in Catalonia, publishing orders and dispositions, mobilizing organizational work and disseminating propaganda. It chiefly consisted of 3 sections: news, opinion and fixed columns, dominated by religious subjects. The daily developed weekly mutations in Tarragona, Girona and Lleida. Its circulation is not clear; some sources claim 4,000 copies and some claim as much as 8,000 copies. Personal Llauder's trademark were his Sunday editorials. In 1899 he ceded command of the paper to Salvador Morales.\n\nThe 1884-launched \"La Hormiga de Oro\" was among innovative periodicals on the Spanish market; published in A3, they combined text and high-quality graphics, first drawings and since early 1890s also photographs. The weekly aspired to the role of popular enciclopedia educativa; its contents comprised news, information, history, letters, arts, politics, though it was dominated by religion-related topics. Key difference between \"Hormiga\" and likewise reviews was its confessional nature; it was intended to disseminate Christian thought by means of affordable modern media. Carlism, though present, did not form a leading thread. Distribution included Spain, Portugal, Philippines and Latin America, the number of subscribers estimated at 4,000; in the early 20th century it was one of 6 reviews with the highest circulation in Spain. Llauder did not run \"Hormiga\", ceding management to different directors.\n\nThe power plant behind Llauder's periodicals was his publishing house \"La Hormiga de Oro\", founded in 1887; of three similar Carlist enterprises in Catalonia it was the most stable and the most durable one. With a dedicated book shop serving as a front-end customer interface, the conglomerate demonstrated that Llauder was fully conscious of the commencing mass culture era. Its business soundness is unclear. It remains striking that Llauder, himself a solitary leading a modest life, between 1871 and 1902 sold real estate inherited from his ancestors. It seems that a fortune, accumulated by nine generations of the Llauder family, has ultimately been spent as financial reserve sustaining Carlist propaganda machinery in Catalonia.\n\nLlauder kept contributing to different newspapers between mid-1860s and early 20th century, though his opus is mostly editorials to \"Correo Catalan\"; between 1888 and 1900 he published 537 of them. Written in Spanish, they were usually clearly attributable, covered range of topics and served as semi-official Carlist lecture. Llauder was no political theorist, but his contribution is named \"corpus de doctrina carlista\" and compared to that of key Carlist ideologues like Aparisi Guijarro or Vázquez de Mella. Some maintain that Llauder underwent ideological evolution, testimonial to schizophrenia of Carlism in the late 19th century; others argue that he demonstrated \"coherencia personal i ideologica\". Upon death he was hailed as giant figure in journalism, today in historiography of Spanish \"periodismo\" he is acknowledged rather briefly.\n\nThe primary feature of Llauder's writings was Catholicism; some described his editorial activity as secular evangelization and dubbed him \"sacerdote de la causa\". His religiosity was formatted along fundamentalist lines, based on Manichean vision of the world as a battleground between God and satan. Principal Llauder's foe was liberal Catholicism; campaigns against its embodiment, , were by some dubbed as pidalofobia. Most events were interpreted within chiliastic perspective, either episodes like cholera threat in 1890 and attempt against Martínez Campos in 1893 or milestones of Spanish history like the 1898 crisis. The Cuban war was seen as a warning (maybe the final one) to Spain, and the United States was presented as a divine tool, sort of a plague, administered by God to punish the Spaniards for their offences.\n\nLlauder's vision of politics was an Integrist one. He viewed Carlism not as a political option, but rather as work of divine providence; within this perspective dynastic issues were secondary to questions of principles. Carlism was the trunk of the good tree as opposed to the bad tree; the trunk of the latter was Liberalism, its gardeners were Protestants, freemasonry and Judaism, while its satanic fruits were nihilism, socialism and anarchism, all patricide ideologies. The Restoration regime was considered a farce, while the party system and universal suffrage were deemed corruptive manipulative mechanisms. Llauder viewed social problems as part of religious issue, results of godless Liberalism allowing shameless profiteering, brought to Spain by foreign and Jewish speculators. Spanish economy was described as feudalism of money, with Jews playing seniors and their vassals.\n\nThough some scholars claim that opposing centralization was one of his political principles and underline that foralism was key component of Catalan Carlism, others argue that regionalism did not form a key thread of his writings. He considered genuine Traditionalists \"españoles de sangre y corazón\". He viewed nascent Catalanism with cautious sympathy as sort of unconscious Carlism; he encouraged the young Catalanists to look for their own way, confident that sooner or later they would join the ranks of Traditionalism and its vision of \"Catalunya muntanyenca\". It was only after a few years when he concluded with some surprise that key Catalanist tribune \"\" was \"periódico sistemáticamente anticarlista\".\n\n\n"}

A former Modern Orthodox rabbi, Gafni now self-identifies as a practitioner of world spirituality based on integral principles. Accused of sexual assault by multiple women, Gafni has acknowledged a nine-month relationship with a 14-year-old girl when he was 19; he denies the relationship was abusive, describing it as consensual \"teenage necking\".\n\nGafni was born in 1960 to Holocaust survivors in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Gafni was educated at Modern-Orthodox yeshivas in the New York City area. In the 1980s, while attending Yeshiva University, Gafni worked with Jewish Public School Youth, an organization providing Jewish social clubs in public schools. In 1988, Gafni also worked as a rabbi in Boca Raton, Florida. After making aliyah, Gafni served as rabbi of the West Bank settlement of Tzofim. When Gafni moved to Israel he hebraicized his name. \"Winiarz,\" Polish for \"vintner,\" is related to the Hebrew word (), which means \"grape\"—thus the name \"Gafni.\" Gafni has three children from previous marriages and one child with Mariana Caplan.\n\nGafni majored in philosophy as an undergraduate and earned his doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University. He claims to hold rabbinic certification from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, but Gafni has since returned his \"semikhah\" to \"spare his former teacher any further embarrassment\".\n\nGafni's teachings are often described as integral or world spirituality, incorporating traditional religious studies to contemporary themes, and are aimed at spirituality for people who do not identify with one specific religion. Gafni describes himself and his students as \"dual citizens\" of both their native traditional religion and the broader themes of \"world spirituality\". He advocates a new set of teachings around eros, sexuality and relationships in his book \"Mystery of Love\" and CD set \"Erotic and the Holy\". At the core of his world spirituality message is what Gafni refers to as the unique self, \"a series of integral discernments between separateness and uniqueness, ego and Unique Self, and personal and impersonal man.\" Gafni believes that \"the sexual is the ultimate Spiritual Master\" and has written \"I was convinced from an early age that religion had lost what I believed must have been its original erotic vitality…I knew that the sexual, if liberated and ethically expressed, must somehow hold the mystery of return to the much larger-than-sexual Eros.\"\n\nIn 2010, Gafni, together with Mariana Caplan—the mother of his son Zion, Sally Kempton, and Lori Galperin, founded the Center for World Spirituality. That year, Gafni and Ken Wilber founded a Wisdom Council to envision a world spirituality based on Integral Principles. The Wisdom Council is part of the Center for World Spirituality and includes members such as Gafni, Wilber, Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra, Warren Farrell, Lori Galperin, Sally Kempton and other leaders. The co-chair of Center for World Spirituality is Whole Foods CEO John Mackey.\n\nGafni was a Scholar in Residence at the Integral Institute and the Director of the Integral Spiritual Experience but left after the 2011 allegations of his sexual impropriety.\n\nGafni is the author of eight books on spirituality and religion, including the 2001 \"Soul Prints\". Marc Gafni's second English-language book, \"The Mystery of Love\", was later converted to an audio lecture series called \"The Erotic and the Holy\", published by Sounds True. He also co-authored \"Who is Afraid of Lilith? Rereading the Kabbalah of the Feminine Shadow\" with Ohad Ezrachi. He wrote \"Radical Kabbalah\", a two-volume work published by Integral Publishers in 2012. In 2012, he published \"Your Unique Self: The Radical Path to Personal Enlightenment\" with a foreword written by Wilber. It won the 2012 USA Book News Best Book of the Year award in the Spirituality: General category.\n\nWhile in Israel, Gafni hosted (), a television program broadcast on Israel's Channel 2. Gafni also did a series of weekly television spots with Israeli comedian Gil Kopatch on biblical wisdom for every day life. Gafni appeared in a series of spiritual public service announcements on Israeli television in the wake of several terrorist attacks.\n\nIn 2005, Gafni spoke with the Dalai Lama about the perception of love. In 2010 Gafni did a series with Chopra entitled \"Love and Evolution\". In 2013, Gafni and Eben Pagan founded an event called \"Actualize: The Source Code of Success\".\n\nGafni has been accused of sexual assault multiple times dating back to the 1980s.\n\nIn early January 2016, Judy Mitzner alleged that she was one of two teenage girls whom Gafni molested in New York City in 1986. She reiterated those claims on an appearance on the Dr. Phil show of January 19, 2018, in which Gafni also appeared.\n\nAlso in January 2016, an unnamed woman wrote that she was married to Gafni from 1999 to 2004 in an opinion piece in \"The Times of Israel\" . The article was in response to a \"New York Times\" article about Gafni the preceding week. She catalogued what she described as her story of abuse and wrote that she had gone public to \"Protect some girl. Protect some woman. Some student. Some unsuspecting soul.\" Within two weeks, Sara Kabakov revealed in \"The Forward\" that she was the formerly unnamed teenage girl who had been abused by Gafni in the early 1980s, beginning when she was thirteen years old. Gafni commented, \"she was 14 going on 35, and I never forced her.\" In a subsequent article, \"The Forward\" published Gafni's response together with the analysis of sexual abuse experts. Gafni included polygraph results to support his claim that his relationship with Kabakov was consensual. Afterwards, Kabakov responded to Gafni's comments and reiterated her claim that the relationship was not consensual. In February 2017, the National Coalition for Men published an article by Gafni in which he defended himself, calling the allegations \"a long-standing smear campaign\". The following month, he published another rebuttal on Medium.com. This accusation was also addressed on the Dr. Phil episode of January 19, 2018.\n\nIn 2006, after he moved to Israel, Gafni was accused by three women who attended the () spiritual center in Jaffa, which Gafni opened in the late 1990s. Gafni acknowledged relationships with some of the women. However, he characterized the relationships as consensual and supported his claim by posting polygraph results on his website. Because of the allegations, and because Gafni fled the country to avoid prosecution, he was dismissed from , which closed within days. Back in the United States, Gafni sent a remorseful letter to his congregation saying he regretted his actions. Gafni later claimed the letter was not an admission of guilt but an attempt to cool the controversy.\n\nGafni was the subject of new allegations of sexual misconduct in 2011. As a result, Integral Life, one of Gafni's promoters, deleted his contributions from its website and announced that it was distancing itself from him. Tami Simon, CEO of Sounds True, canceled her planned publication of Gafni's book, \"Your Unique Self\", and issued a statement denouncing him. The board of directors of the Center for World Spirituality, an organization co-founded by Gafni and of which he is CEO, issued a statement of \"unequivocal support\" for Gafni. Wilber first separated from Gafni, but the two eventually reconciled and Wilber rejoined Gafni at the Center for World Spirituality. \"Your Unique Self\" was ultimately published by Integral Publishers.\n"}

Breit and Kenneth G. Elzinga, professors of economics at Trinity University, San Antonio and the University of Virginia, respectively.\n\nIt was Breit's notion to write a mystery novel in which an amateur detective uses economic theory to solve crimes. Elzinga was enthusiastic about his colleague's idea and not only encouraged him to proceed but also decided to take an active role in writing the book. Over the next twenty years, on top of their academic schedules, Breit and Elzinga co-authored three mystery books featuring Harvard economist-sleuth Henry Spearman. The first Henry Spearman Mystery, \"Murder at the Margin\", came out in 1978, and was followed by \"The Fatal Equilibrium\" (1985), \"A Deadly Indifference\" (1995) and \"The Mystery of the Invisible Hand\" (2014).\n\nWhen, in 1978, after a three-year collaboration, the two economists' first foray into crime fiction was eventually published by Thomas Horton and Daughters, there was no indication on the book cover as to the true identity of the authors. Rather, Elzinga had concocted a fanciful biography of \"Marshall Jevons\" which read:\n\nMarshall Jevons is the President of UtilMax, Inc., an international consulting firm headquartered in New York City. A former Rhodes Scholar, he holds advanced degrees in economics, biochemistry, and oceanography. Mr. Jevons is an Olympic medal holder in kayaking whose hobbies now include rocketry and the futures market in cocoa beans. He is a native of Virginia but prefers to call 'home' the Queen Elizabeth 2. This is Marshall Jevons' first novel.\n\nHowever, in subsequent editions of the book, Breit and Elzinga's authorship was recognized. \"Murder at the Margin\" has since been used as supplementary reading in many introductory courses in economics. In commercial terms the novel was a success, and MIT Press approached the authors to suggest they write another Henry Spearman Mystery which they would publish. Thus, in 1985, \"The Fatal Equilibrium\" became the first mystery novel to be published by a university press. One year later, a mass market paperback was issued, prompting Marshall Jevons to comment that “there are few pleasures more satisfying than seeing one's own paperback in a book rack at an airport newsstand”.\n\nThe name \"Marshall Jevons\" derives from the surnames of two 19th-century English economists, Alfred Marshall and William Stanley Jevons.\n\nA blog about economics called \"The Bayesian Heresy\" has also adopted the pseudonym.\n"}

Unsurprisingly for a girl of her background, she was privately educated at home and presented at court before going to Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford University, and she entered enthusiastically into traditional English field sports. This background developed certain qualities helpful to her later work in archaeology. As well as being well-read and skilled in drawing, she built up physical stamina while deer stalking.\n\nWhen, at the age of 37, she married Michael Seiradakis, a Cretan from an ordinary village background, her parents did not go the wedding, though a conventional announcement appeared in \"The Times\".\n\nAfter graduating in Modern History in 1932 she asked Arthur Evans to accept her as a student helper at Knossos. Evans had led this major project for decades but by this time excavations were directed by John Pendlebury, who became a mentor to Seiradaki. As well as excavating he undertook a major reorganisation of the on-site Stratigraphical Museum, a task in which Seiradaki would take a large part. She was accepted as a student of the British School at Athens at the same time as Edith Eccles who became a friend with whom she worked and travelled. Her endurance and stamina on difficult journeys over mountain tracks were noteworthy. There were several young women archaeologists from the UK and all were determined not to be put off by difficult terrain and challenging routes, and yet Seiradaki stood out for her reluctance even to ride a mule instead of walking.\n\nAfter a winter in Athens studying prehistoric pottery she and Eccles went to Crete to help complete the catalogue of the museum at Knossos. Pendlebury and his wife worked to date one third of a huge collection of sherds assembled in 2000 boxes. Eccles and Seiradaki dated the rest and published the results in instalments. They also went on several expeditions in central Crete, often with Pendlebury, seeking out new sites and checking on some already discovered. This led to Pendlebury's book the \"Archaeology of Crete\" in which half of the illustrations were drawn by Seiradaki, particularly the drawings of seal stones and pottery patterns.\n\nIn 1934 she explored a variety of archaeological sites in the Peloponnese and other parts of mainland Greece, and returned to Crete in 1935. She continued to work in association with Pendlebury: in particular around Lasithi in central Crete. She excavated, helped publish, and also took opportunities to travel with Eccles. Some of her travel was to the Middle East and Egypt to explore links between Minoan and Oriental cultures. Although Arthur Evans' visits to Knossos had become less frequent in the 1930s, he knew enough about her work to give her the role of organising the Knossos section of a London exhibition celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the British School, and of helping with a further display at the Ashmolean. He also used one of her drawings of a hoard of axes to illustrate his last work on the palace at Knossos.\n\nWhen the cave at Trapeza was excavated she was responsible for the pottery and the challenge of dating it. She produced an extensive illustrated and descriptive catalogue of pottery and other smaller finds. About three quarters of the work published about the cave is by Seiradaki. She did similar work for other excavations run by Pendlebury in Lesithi, publishing as M. Money-Coutts. The work at Karphi was fully completed in 1960 when she published \"Pottery from Karphi\" under the name mercy Seiradaki.\n\nShe was whole-hearted not only about her work but also about life on Crete. She learned modern Greek, got to know the island, its people and culture and was known for her ability to get on with local workers on site. In this way, she can be seen as a pioneer of contemporary approaches to archaeological work, while she also fitted the early 20th century pattern of women assisting senior male archaeologists.\n\nIn the early years of the Second World War she worked, probably as a secretary, at Bletchley Park, the secret code breaking establishment. In 1944 she joined the Red Cross and was sent to Egypt. She is presumed to have wanted to return to Crete where some of the men she knew had worked with the Resistance, as did many academics associated with the British School at Athens. She and Eccles managed to travel from Libya to Crete in 1944 when the island was still considered dangerous. After her friend left for Athens she stayed on in Crete working for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was awarded the bronze medal of the Greek Red Cross for her courage, and became a local heroine. Through UNRRA she met her husband who received many honours for acts of wartime bravery.\n\nAfter marrying and having a son and daughter she lived in Crete until 1962. She continued her Red Cross work, her involvement with archaeology on the island, and offered \"open house\" hospitality to English-speaking visitors. She worked on her drawings for the Karphi pottery book and was a member of the first British Council in Chania. When the family moved to Athens in 1962 Seiradaki was active in the British School library. She died on 1 September 1993.\n"}

{"id": "331689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331689", "title": "Michael Shermer", "text": "Michael Shermer\n\nMichael Brant Shermer (born September 8, 1954) is an American science writer, historian of science, founder of The Skeptics Society, and editor-in-chief of its magazine \"Skeptic\", which is largely devoted to investigating pseudoscientific and supernatural claims. The Skeptics Society currently has over 55,000 members. Shermer engages in debates on topics pertaining to pseudoscience and religion in which he emphasizes scientific skepticism.\n\nShermer is producer and co-host of the 13-hour Fox Family television series \"Exploring the Unknown\" which was broadcast in 1999. Since April 2001, he has been a monthly columnist for \"Scientific American\" magazine with his \"Skeptic\" column. He is also a scientific advisor to the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH).\n\nShermer was once a fundamentalist Christian, but ceased to believe in the existence of God during his graduate studies. He accepts the labels agnostic, nontheist, atheist and others. He has expressed reservations about such labels for his lack of belief in a God, however, as he sees them being used in the service of \"pigeonholing\", and prefers to simply be called a skeptic. He also describes himself as an advocate for humanist philosophy as well as the science of morality.\n\nMichael Brant Shermer was born on September 8, 1954 in Los Angeles.\n\nAn only child, he was raised in Southern California, primarily in the La Cañada Flintridge area. His parents divorced when he was four and later remarried, his mother to a man with three children, who became Shermer's step-sister and two step-brothers, and his father to a woman with whom he had two daughters, Shermer's half-sisters. His father died of a heart attack in 1986, and his mother of brain cancer in 2000.\n\nAlthough Shermer went to Sunday school, he says that neither his biological parents, stepparents nor siblings were religious nor non-religious, as they did not discuss that topic often, nor did they attend church or pray together. Shermer began his senior year of high school in 1971, when the evangelical movement in the United States was beginning to gain popularity. One night at the behest of his best friend George, whose parents were Christian, Shermer converted to Christianity. The next day the two friends attended the Glendale, Presbyterian Church, where a sermon was given by what Shermer describes as \"a very dynamic and histrionic preacher who inspired me to come forward at the end of the sermon to be saved.\" For the next seven years he evangelized door-to-door as part of his profoundly held beliefs.\n\nShermer attended an informal Christian study fellowship group at a place called \"The Barn\" in La Crescenta, California, which Shermer describes as \"a quintessential 1970s-era hang-out with a long-haired hippie-type, guitar-playing leader who read Bible passages that we discussed at length.\" Shermer enjoyed the social aspects of religion, and particularly relished its theological debates.\n\nShermer was raised with guns. His stepfather was a hunter who took Shermer and their hunting dogs with him on hunting excursions half a dozen times a year, shooting game such as doves, ducks, and quail with shotguns. They ate everything they killed, for which Shermer's stepfather also displayed culinary skills. Growing up, Shermer owned a BB gun, then a pellet gun, then a 20-gauge shotgun, and then a 12-gauge shotgun.\n\nShermer graduated from Crescenta Valley High School in 1972. Desiring serious theological training, he enrolled at Pepperdine University with the intent of becoming a theologian. He initially majored in Christian theology. In addition to taking courses on the Bible, Shermer studied the writings of C.S. Lewis, and he attended chapel twice a week, which was required for all students. Despite the restrictions imposed on students, such as a ban on dancing and visiting the dorm rooms of opposite sex, Shermer found the university a good experience, and he accepted its teachings as a valid guide for behavior. However, when he learned that the PhD needed to be a professor of theology required proficiency in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Aramaic, Shermer, who did not find foreign languages to be his forte, switched his major to psychology.\n\nHe has stated that at this point he \"mastered one of the languages of science: statistics\", and that he learned about forming hypotheses, the null hypothesis and testing hypotheses, which led to a change in his thinking. He completed his BA in psychology at Pepperdine in 1976.\n\nShermer's master's degree in experimental psychology at the California State University, Fullerton, led to many after-class discussions with professors Bayard Brattstrom and Meg White at a local pub—The 301 Club—that went late into the night. These discussions, along with his studies in cultural anthropology, led him to question his religious beliefs. He abandoned his devout religious views, fueled by what he perceived to be the intolerance generated by the absolute morality he was taught in his religious studies; the hypocrisy in what many believers preached and what they practiced; and his growing awareness of other religious beliefs, and how they were determined by the temporal, geographic, and cultural circumstances in which their adherents were born. From this, Shermer came to conclude it is \"obvious that God was made in our likeness and not the reverse.\" By midway through his graduate training, he removed the Christian silver ichthys medallion that he had been wearing around his neck for years. He completed his MA degree from the California State University in psychology in 1978.\n\nThe final step in Shermer's abandoning religion came when his college sweetheart, Maureen, was in an automobile accident that broke her back and rendered her paralyzed from the waist down. Shermer relates:\n\nWhen I saw her at the Long Beach Medical Center ER, the full implications of what this meant for her begin to dawn on me. There, in the ER, day after dreary day, night after sleepless night, I took a knee and bowed my head and asked God to heal Maureen's broken back. I prayed with deepest sincerity. I cried out to God to overlook my doubts in the name of Maureen. I willingly suspended all disbelief. At that time and in that place, I was once again a believer. I believed because I wanted to believe that if there was any justice in the universe — any at all — this sweet, loving, smart, responsible, devoted, caring spirit did not deserve to be in a shattered body. A just and loving God who had the power to heal, would surely heal Maureen. He didn't. He didn't, I now believe, not because \"God works in mysterious ways\" or \"He has a special plan for Maureen\" — the nauseatingly banal comforts believers sometimes offer in such trying and ultimately futile times — but because there is no God.\n\nAfter earning his MA in experimental psychology in 1978, Shermer was unable to secure a position in a PhD program, and landed a job writing for a bicycle magazine in Irvine, California. His first assignment, a Cycles Peugeot press conference featuring John Marino, who had just ridden from Los Angeles to New York in 13 days, one hour, and 20 minutes, made a deep impression on Shermer. He bought a bike and entered the Yoplait Yogurt 50-kilometer race through Griffith Park in Los Angeles the following weekend. His interest grew rapidly, and within a short time he had completed his first century ride (100 miles). Before long he was riding hundreds of miles a week.\n\nShermer began competitive cycling in 1979, and he spent a decade as a professional rider. Shermer's best known bicycling is in the very long distance ultramarathon road racing discipline. Shermer is a founding member of the Ultra Cycling Hall of Fame.\n\nDuring the course of his cycling career, Shermer worked with cycling technologists in developing better products for the sport. During his association with Bell Helmets, a bicycle-race sponsor, Shermer advised them on design issues regarding their development of expanded-polystyrene for use in cycling helmets, which would absorb impact far better than the old leather \"hairnet\" helmets used by bicyclists for decades. Shermer advised them that if their helmets looked too much like motorcycle helmets, in which polystyrene was already being used, and not like the old hairnet helmets, no serious cyclists or amateur would use them. This suggestion led to their model, the \"V1 Pro\", which looked like a black leather hairnet, but functioned on the inside like a motorcycle helmet. In 1982, Shermer worked with Wayman Spence, whose small supply company, Spenco Medical, adapted the gel technology Spence developed for bedridden patients with pressure sores into cycling gloves and saddles to alleviate the carpal tunnel syndrome and saddle sores suffered by cyclists.\n\nDuring the decade in which he raced long distances, he helped to found the 3,000-mile nonstop transcontinental bicycle Race Across America (known as \"RAAM\", along with Lon Haldeman and John Marino), in which he competed five times (1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1989), was an assistant race director for six years, and the executive race director for seven years. An acute medical condition is named for him: \"Shermer Neck\" is pain in and extreme weakness of the neck muscles found among long-distance bicyclists. Shermer suffered the condition about 2,000 miles into the 1983 Race Across America. Shermer's embrace of scientific skepticism crystallized during his time as a cyclist, explaining, \"I became a skeptic on Saturday, August 6, 1983, on the long climbing road to Loveland Pass, Colorado\", after months of training under the guidance of a \"nutritionist\" with an unaccredited PhD. After years of practicing acupuncture, chiropractic, massage therapy, negative ions, rolfing, pyramid power, fundamentalist Christianity, and \"a host of weird things\" (with the exception of drugs) to improve his life and training, Shermer stopped rationalizing the failure of these practices. Shermer later produced several documentary films on cycling.\n\nShermer still cycles actively, and participated in the Furnace Creek 508 in October 2011, a qualifying race for RAAM, finishing second in the four man team category.\n\nShermer has written on the subject of pervasive doping in competitive cycling and a game theoretic view of the dynamics driving the problem in several sports. He wrote specifically about r-EPO doping, which he saw as both widespread and well known within the sport, which was later shown to be instrumental in the doping scandal surrounding Lance Armstrong in 2010.\n\nWhile cycling, Shermer taught Psychology 101 during the evenings at Glendale Community College, a two-year college. Wanting to teach at a four-year university, he decided to earn his PhD. Because Shermer's interests lay in behaviorism and he did not believe he could make a difference in the world by working in a lab with Skinner boxes, he lost interest in psychology and switched to studying the history of science, earning his PhD at Claremont Graduate University in 1991. His dissertation was titled \"Heretic-Scientist: Alfred Russel Wallace and the Evolution of Man: A Study on the Nature of Historical Change\".\n\nShermer later based a full-length book on his dissertation; the book, titled \"In Darwin's Shadow: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace: A Biographical Study on the Psychology of History\", was published in August 2002.\n\nEarlier that year, in his book \"The Borderlands of Science\", Shermer rated several noted scientists for gullibility toward \"pseudo\" or \"borderland\" ideas, using a rating version, developed by psychologist Frank Sulloway, of the Big Five model of personality. Shermer rated Wallace extremely high (99th percentile) on agreeableness/accommodation and argued that this was the key trait in distinguishing Wallace from scientists who give less credence to fringe ideas.\n\nShermer then became an adjunct professor of the history of science at Occidental College, California. In 2007, Shermer took a position as a senior research fellow at Claremont Graduate University. In 2011, he took a position as an adjunct professor at Chapman University, and was later made a Presidential Fellow. At Chapman, he teaches a yearly critical thinking course called Skepticism 101, in which he tries out new ideas on students.\n\nIn 1992, Shermer founded the Skeptics Society, which began as a hobby in his garage, but eventually grew into a full-time occupation. The Skeptics Society publishes the magazine \"Skeptic\", and organizes the Caltech Lecture Series. As of 2008, it has over 55,000 members.\n\nShermer is also a scientific advisor to the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH).\n\nShermer is the author of books which attempt to explain the ubiquity of irrational or poorly substantiated beliefs, including UFOs, Bigfoot, and paranormal claims. In 1997, he wrote \"Why People Believe Weird Things\", which explores a variety of \"weird\" ideas and groups (including cults), in the tradition of the skeptical writings of Martin Gardner. A revised and expanded edition was published in 2002. He writes in the Introduction:So we are left with the legacy of two types of thinking errors: \"Type 1 Error: believing a falsehood\" and \"Type 2 Error: rejecting a truth\". ... Believers in UFOs, alien abductions, ESP, and psychic phenomena have committed a Type 1 Error in thinking: they are believing a falsehood. ... It's not that these folks are ignorant or uninformed; they are intelligent but misinformed. Their thinking has gone wrong.In \"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science\", Shermer explored the psychology behind the belief in God. In its introduction, Shermer wrote \"Never in history have so many, and such a high percentage of the population, believed in God. Not only is God not dead as Nietzsche proclaimed, but he has never been more alive.\"\n\nSince April 2001, he has written the monthly \"Skeptic\" column for \"Scientific American\". He has also contributed to \"Time\" magazine.\n\nIn February 2002, he characterized the position that \"God had no part in the process [of the evolution of mankind]\" as the \"standard scientific theory\". This statement was criticized in January 2006 by the scientist Eugenie Scott, who commented that science makes no claim about God one way or the other.\n\nIn May 2002, Shermer and Alex Grobman published their book \"Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?\", which examined and refuted the Holocaust denial movement. This book recounts meeting various denialists and concludes that free speech is the best way to deal with pseudohistory.\n\n\"\" was released in 2005. His 2006 book \"\" marshals point-by-point arguments supporting evolution, sharply criticizing intelligent design. This book also argues that science cannot invalidate religion, and that Christians and conservatives can and should accept evolution.\n\nIn June 2006, Shermer, who formerly expressed skepticism regarding the mainstream scientific views on global warming, wrote in \"Scientific American\" magazine that, in the light of the accumulation of evidence, the position of denying global warming is no longer tenable.\n\n\"The Mind of The Market: Compassionate Apes, Competitive Humans, and Other Tales from Evolutionary Economics\" was released in 2007. In it Shermer reports on the findings of multiple behavioral and biochemical studies that address evolutionary explanations for modern behavior. It garnered several critical reviews from academics, with skeptic Robert T. Carroll saying: \"He has been blinded by his libertarianism and seduced by the allure of evolutionary psychology to explain everything, including ethics and economics.\"\n\nIn February 2009, Shermer published \"The History of Science: A Sweeping Visage of Science and its History\", a 25-hour audio lecture. In May 2011, Shermer published \"The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies: How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths\".\n\nPrior to work on science and skepticism, Shermer published books on cycling and others on child education in the math and science disciplines. These include collaborations with Arthur Benjamin.\n\nIn January 2015, Shermer published \"\".\n\nHarriet Hall says of Shermer's 2018 publication, \"Heavens on Earth: The Scientific Search for the Afterlife, Immortality, and Utopia\", that \"the topics of \"Heavens on Earth\" are usually relegated to the spheres of philosophy and religion, but Shermer approaches them through science, looking for evidence -- or lack thereof.\" She goes on to say that \"[s]ome will argue that Shermer goes beyond the science\" but that \"it will definitely ... make the reader think.\"\n\nShermer appeared as a guest on \"Donahue\" in 1994 to respond to Bradley Smith's and David Cole's Holocaust denial claims, and in 1995 on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" to challenge Rosemary Altea's psychic claims. Shermer made a guest appearance in a 2004 episode of Penn & Teller's \"\", in which he argued that events in the Bible constitute \"mythic storytelling\", rather than events described literally. His stance was supported by the show's hosts, who have expressed their own atheism. The episode in question, \"The Bible: Fact or Fiction?\", sought to debunk the notion that the Bible is an empirically reliable historical record. Opposing Shermer was Paul Maier, professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.\n\nShermer made several appearances on NBC's daytime paranormal-themed show \"The Other Side\" in 1994 and 1995. After getting to know the show's producers, he made a formal pitch to their production company for his own skepticism-oriented reality show whose aim would be to present points of view of both believers and skeptics. His proposals were not fruitful, but several years later, one of the executives of that company went to work for the then-newly formed Fox Family Channel, and impressed with Shermer's show treatment, requested he pitch it to the network. The network picked up the series, \"Exploring the Unknown\", of which Shermer became a producer and cohost. The series, which was budgeted at approximately $200,000 per episode, was viewed by Shermer as a direct extension of the work done at the Skeptics Society and \"Skeptic\" magazine, and would enable Shermer to reach more people. The equivocal title was chosen so as to not tip off guests or viewers as to the skeptical nature of the show. Various segments from \"Exploring the Unknown\" can be found on Shermer's YouTube channel. In 1999, Shermer produced and co-hosted the Fox Family TV series \"Exploring the Unknown\".\n\nShermer has been a speaker at all three Beyond Belief events from 2006 to 2008. He also spoke at the 2006 TED Conference on \"Why people believe strange things\". In 2008, he delivered the commencement speech at Whittier College, which awarded him with an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters. He is also an occasional guest on \"Skepticality\", the official podcast of \"Skeptic\".\n\nShermer has debated Deepak Chopra on multiple occasions, including during their March 2010 appearance on the ABC News program \"Nightline\". He has named Chopra his personal favourite debating partner.\n\nOn August 21, 2010, Shermer was honored with an award recognizing his contributions in the skeptical field, from the Independent Investigations Group during its 10th Anniversary Gala.\n\nAs of 2007, Shermer lives in Altadena, California. He married Jennifer Graf, a native of Cologne, Germany, on June 25, 2014. The ceremony was performed by Shermer's sister, Tina, who was ordained online for the occasion. A lifelong dog lover, he previously had a dog named Darwin, and as of April 2018, they have a Chocolate Labrador Retriever named Hitch, in honor of Christopher Hitchens.\n\nPolitically, Shermer has described himself as a lifelong libertarian. In a 2015 interview, Shermer stated that he prefers to talk about individual issues, lamenting that, in the past, people would refuse to even listen to him because of his self-description as a libertarian. In this same interview, he also mentioned that his research into gun control led him to believe that some measures to reduce gun-related violence would be beneficial. The first president he voted for was Richard Nixon in 1972, which, in light of the Watergate scandal, he calls his \"most embarrassing vote\".\n\nIn 2000, he voted for Harry Browne to \"vote his conscience\", on the assumption that the winner of the Al Gore – George W. Bush contest would be irrelevant. He later regretted this decision, believing that Bush's foreign policy made the world more dangerous, and he voted for John Kerry in 2004. Shermer has named Thomas Jefferson as his favorite president, for his championing of liberty and his application of scientific thinking to the political, economic, and social spheres. He says of Jefferson, \"When he dined alone at the White House there was more intelligence in that room than when John F. Kennedy hosted a dinner there for a roomful of Nobel laureates.\"\n\nShermer once opposed most gun control measures, primarily because of his beliefs in the principle of increasing individual freedom and decreased government intervention, and also because he has owned guns for most of his life. As an adult, he owned a .357 Magnum pistol for a quarter of a century for protection, although he eventually took it out of the house, and then got rid of it entirely. Though he no longer owns guns, he continues to support the right to own guns to protect one's family. However, by 2013, the data on gun homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings convinced him that some modest gun control measures might be necessary.\n\nShermer also previously favored capital punishment, primarily in sympathy for victims' families, but later he came to oppose the death penalty, partially out of a resistance to giving the government too much power – in light of the hundreds of executed individuals who were later revealed to be innocent – and partially from his view that retributive justice is driven by humanity's baser instincts, and it does not effect restorative justice. He later changed his mind about the issue during research for \"The Moral Arc\", reasoning that \"[Capital punishment] is one of these barbaric practices that we need to get rid of. [The United States of] America is really the last of the 19 industrialized democracies to have the death penalty. (...) The Italian enlightenment philosopher Cesare Beccaria, on his book On Crimes and Punishments, put forward the idea that the punishment should fit the crime and that the criteria should be whether it keeps people from committing crimes, and the Death Penalty does not do that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22149", "title": "Nagarjuna", "text": "Nagarjuna\n\nNāgārjuna (c. 150 – c. 250 CE) is widely considered one of the most important Buddhist philosophers. Along with his disciple Āryadeva, he is considered to be the founder of the Madhyamaka school of Mahāyāna Buddhism. Nāgārjuna is also credited with developing the philosophy of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and, in some sources, with having revealed these scriptures in the world, having recovered them from the nāgas (water spirits often depicted in the form of serpent-like humans). Furthermore, he is traditionally supposed to have written several treatises on rasayana as well as serving a term as the head of Nālandā.\n\nVery little is reliably known of the life of Nāgārjuna, since the surviving accounts were written in Chinese and Tibetan centuries after his death. According to some accounts, Nāgārjuna was originally from South India. Some scholars believe that Nāgārjuna was an advisor to a king of the Satavahana dynasty. Archaeological evidence at Amarāvatī indicates that if this is true, the king may have been Yajña Śrī Śātakarṇi, who ruled between 167 and 196 CE. On the basis of this association, Nāgārjuna is conventionally placed at around 150–250 CE.\n\nAccording to a 4th/5th-century biography translated by Kumārajīva, Nāgārjuna was born into a Brahmin family in Vidarbha (a region of Maharashtra) and later became a Buddhist.\n\nSome sources claim that in his later years, Nāgārjuna lived on the mountain of Śrīparvata near the city that would later be called Nāgārjunakoṇḍa (\"Hill of Nāgārjuna\"). The ruins of Nāgārjunakoṇḍa are located in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. The Caitika and Bahuśrutīya nikāyas are known to have had monasteries in Nāgārjunakoṇḍa. The archaeological finds at Nagarjunakonda have not resulted in any evidence that the site was associated with Nagarjuna. The name \"Nagarjunakonda\" dates from the medieval period, and the 3rd-4th century inscriptions found at the site make it clear that it was known as \"Vijayapuri\" in the ancient period.\n\nThere exist a number of influential texts attributed to Nāgārjuna though, as there are many pseudepigrapha attributed to him, lively controversy exists over which are his authentic works. \n\nThe \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" is Nāgārjuna's best-known work. It is \"not only a grand commentary on the Buddha's discourse to Kaccayana, the only discourse cited by name, but also a detailed and careful analysis of most of the important discourses included in the Nikayas and the agamas, especially those of the \"Atthakavagga\" of the \"Sutta-nipata\".\n\nIn the \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\", \"[A]ll experienced phenomena are empty (\"sunya\"). This did not mean that they are not experienced and, therefore, non-existent; only that they are devoid of a permanent and eternal substance (\"svabhava\") because, like a dream, they are mere projections of human consciousness. Since these imaginary fictions are experienced, they are not mere names (\"prajnapti\").\"\n\nAccording to one view, that of Christian Lindtner, the works definitely written by Nāgārjuna are:\n\nBuston considers the first six to be the main treatises of Nāgārjuna, while according to Taaranaatha only the first five are the works of Nāgārjuna. TRV Murti considers Ratnaavali, Pratitya Samutpaada Hridaya and Sutra Samuccaya to be works of Nāgārjuna as the first two are quoted profusely by Chandrakirti and the third by Shantideva.\n\nIn addition to works mentioned above, several others are attributed to\nNāgārjuna. There is an ongoing, lively controversy over which of those\nworks are authentic. Contemporary research suggest that these works belong\nto a significantly later period, either to late 8th or early 9th century CE,\nand hence can not be authentic works of Nāgārjuna.\n\nHowever, several works considered important in esoteric Buddhism are\nattributed to Nāgārjuna and his disciples by traditional historians\nlike Tāranātha from 17th century Tibet. These historians try to account\nfor chronological difficulties with various theories. For example, a\npropagation of later writings via mystical revelation. For a useful\nsummary of this tradition, see Wedemeyer 2007.\n\nLindtner considers that the \"Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa\" \"Commentary on the Great Perfection of Wisdom\" is not a genuine work of Nāgārjuna. This work is only attested in a Chinese translation by Kumārajīva.There is much discussion as to whether this is a work of Nāgārjuna, or someone else. Étienne Lamotte, who translated one third of the work into French, felt that it was the work of a North Indian bhikṣu of the Sarvāstivāda school who later became a convert to the Mahayana. The Chinese scholar-monk Yin Shun felt that it was the work of a South Indian and that Nāgārjuna was quite possibly the author. These two views are not necessarily in opposition and a South Indian Nāgārjuna could well have studied the northern Sarvāstivāda. Neither of the two felt that it was composed by Kumārajīva, which others have suggested.\n\nFrom studying his writings, it is clear that Nāgārjuna was conversant with many of the Śrāvaka philosophies and with the Mahāyāna tradition. However, determining Nāgārjuna's affiliation with a specific nikāya is difficult, considering much of this material has been lost. If the most commonly accepted attribution of texts (that of Christian Lindtner) holds, then he was clearly a Māhayānist, but his philosophy holds assiduously to the Śrāvaka \"Tripiṭaka\", and while he does make explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, he is always careful to stay within the parameters set out by the Śrāvaka canon.\n\nNāgārjuna may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the āgamas. In the eyes of Nāgārjuna, the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Madhyamaka system. David Kalupahana sees Nāgārjuna as a successor to Moggaliputta-Tissa in being a champion of the middle-way and a reviver of the original philosophical ideals of the Buddha.\n\nNāgārjuna assumes a knowledge of the definitions of the sixteen categories as given in the Nyaya Sutras, the chief text of the Hindu Nyaya school, and wrote a treatise on the pramanas where he reduced the syllogism of five members into one of three. In the Vigrahavyavartani Karika, Nāgārjuna criticizes the Nyaya theory of pramanas (means of knowledge) \n\nNāgārjuna was fully acquainted with the classical Hindu philosophies of Samkhya and even the Vaiseshika.\n\nBecause of the high degree of similarity between Nāgārjuna's philosophy and Pyrrhonism, particularly the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus Thomas McEvilley suspects that Nāgārjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonists texts imported into India. Pyrrho of Elis (c. 360-c. 270 BCE), who is usually credited with founding this school of skeptical philosophy, was himself influenced by Indian philosophy, when he traveled to India with Alexander the Great's army and studied with the gymnosophists.\n\nNāgārjuna's major thematic focus is the concept of śūnyatā (translated into English as \"emptiness\") which brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman \"not-self\" and pratītyasamutpāda \"dependent origination\", to refute the metaphysics of some of his contemporaries. For Nāgārjuna, as for the Buddha in the early texts, it is not merely sentient beings that are \"selfless\" or non-substantial; all phenomena (dhammas) are without any svabhāva, literally \"own-being\", \"self-nature\", or \"inherent existence\" and thus without any underlying essence. They are \"empty\" of being independently existent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhāva circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. This is so because all things arise always dependently: not by their own power, but by depending on conditions leading to their coming into existence, as opposed to being.\n\nNāgārjuna means by real any entity which has a nature of its own (svabhāva), which is not produced by causes (akrtaka), which is not dependent on anything else (paratra nirapeksha).\n\nChapter 24 verse 14 of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā provides one of Nāgārjuna's most famous quotations on emptiness and co-arising:\n\nAs part of his analysis of the emptiness of phenomena in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, Nāgārjuna critiques svabhāva in several different concepts. He discusses the problems of positing any sort of inherent essence to causation, movement, change and personal identity. Nāgārjuna makes use of the Indian logical tool of the tetralemma to attack any essentialist conceptions. Nāgārjuna’s logical analysis is based on four basic propositions:\n\nTo say that all things are 'empty' is to deny any kind of ontological foundation, therefore Nāgārjuna's view is often seen as a kind of ontological anti-foundationalism or a metaphysical anti-realism.\n\nUnderstanding the nature of the emptiness of phenomena is simply a means to an end, which is nirvana. Thus Nāgārjuna's philosophical project is ultimately a soteriological one meant to correct our everyday cognitive processes which mistakenly posits svabhāva on the flow of experience.\n\nSome scholars such as Fyodor Shcherbatskoy and T.R.V. Murti held that Nāgārjuna was the inventor of the Shunyata doctrine, however, more recent work by scholars such as Choong Mun-keat, Yin Shun and Dhammajothi Thero has argued that Nāgārjuna was not an innovator by putting forth this theory, but that, in the words of Shi Huifeng, \"the connection between emptiness and dependent origination is not an innovation or creation of Nāgārjuna.\"\n\nNāgārjuna was also instrumental in the development of the two truths doctrine, which claims that there are two levels of truth in Buddhist teaching, the ultimate truth (\"paramārtha satya\") and the conventional or superficial truth (\"saṃvṛtisatya\"). The ultimate truth to Nāgārjuna is the truth that everything is empty of essence, this includes emptiness itself ('the emptiness of emptiness'). While some (Murti, 1955) have interpreted this by positing Nāgārjuna as a Neo-Kantian and thus making ultimate truth a metaphysical noumenon or an \"ineffable ultimate that transcends the capacities of discursive reason\", others such as Mark Siderits and Jay L. Garfield have argued that Nāgārjuna's view is that \"the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth\" (Siderits) and that Nāgārjuna is a \"semantic anti-dualist\" who posits that there are only conventional truths. Hence according to Garfield:\n\nSuppose that we take a conventional entity, such as a table. We analyze it to demonstrate its emptiness, finding that there is no table apart from its parts […]. So we conclude that it is empty. But now let us analyze that emptiness […]. What do we find? Nothing at all but the table’s lack of inherent existence. […]. To see the table as empty […] is to see the table as conventional, as dependent.\n\nIn articulating this notion in the \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\", Nāgārjuna drew on an early source in the \"Kaccānagotta Sutta\", which distinguishes definitive meaning (\"nītārtha\") from interpretable meaning (\"neyārtha\"):\n\nThe version linked to is the one found in the nikayas, and is slightly different from the one found in the \"Samyuktagama\". Both contain the concept of teaching via the middle between the extremes of existence and non-existence. Nagarjuna does not make reference to \"everything\" when he quotes the agamic text in his \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\".\n\nJay L. Garfield describes that Nāgārjuna approached causality from the four noble truths and dependent origination. Nāgārjuna distinguished two dependent origination views in a causal process, that which causes effects and that which causes conditions. This is predicated in the two truth doctrine, as conventional truth and ultimate truth held together, in which both are empty in existence. The distinction between effects and conditions is controversial. In Nāgārjuna's approach, cause means an event or state that has power to bring an effect. Conditions, refer to proliferating causes that bring a further event, state or process; without a metaphysical commitment to an occult connection between explaining and explanans. He argues nonexistent causes and various existing conditions. The argument draws from unreal causal power. Things conventional exist and are ultimately nonexistent to rest in the middle way in both causal existence and nonexistence as casual emptiness within the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā doctrine. Although seeming strange to Westerners, this is seen as an attack on a reified view of causality.\n\nNāgārjuna also taught the idea of relativity; in the Ratnāvalī, he gives the example that shortness exists only in relation to the idea of length. The determination of a thing or object is only possible in relation to other things or objects, especially by way of contrast. He held that the relationship between the ideas of \"short\" and \"long\" is not due to intrinsic nature (svabhāva). This idea is also found in the Pali Nikāyas and Chinese Āgamas, in which the idea of relativity is expressed similarly: \"That which is the element of light ... is seen to exist on account of [in relation to] darkness; that which is the element of good is seen to exist on account of bad; that which is the element of space is seen to exist on account of form.\"\n\nNāgārjuna is often depicted in composite form comprising human and nāga characteristics. Often the nāga-aspect forms a canopy crowning and shielding his human head. The notion of the naga is found throughout Indian religious culture, and typically signifies an intelligent serpent or dragon, who is responsible for the rains, lakes and other bodies of water. In Buddhism, it is a synonym for a realised arhat, or wise person in general.\n\n\n"}

He grew up in Holstein, later in Nustrup Sogn (Nordschleswig), where the family moved to 1871, and visited the Schleswig-Holstein town gymnasium until 1879. In 1880 he began his theological studies at Leipzig University. There he soon moved to Oriental Studies with a focus on Assyriology under Friedrich Delitzsch. In 1883 Jensen went to Eberhard Schrader in Berlin. After completing his doctorate under Schrader and Eduard Sachau in 1884, Jensen first went to Kiel and to Strasbourg, where he qualified as a librarian in 1888. In 1892 Jensen was called to the University of Marburg as successor to Julius Wellhausen, where he taught Semitic languages as a professor from 1895 to 1928.\n\nHe studied the Babylonian-Assyrian religious literature in his doctoral dissertation and in 1890 published \"Die Kosmologie der Babylonier\" (The Cosmology of the Babylonians). His hypotheses on the comparison of myths pointed to parallels between the Epic of Gilgamesh and Greek (especially Homer) and Israelite \"legends,\" including the story of Jesus in the New Testament. He then worked on this theory as a monumental work \"Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur\" (Gilgamesh in world literature) in 1906 in such a way that he subjected the Old Testament figures from Abraham to the Judaic kings, as well as Jesus and Paul, to an arbitrary interpretation as an Israelite Gilgamesh legend. Jensen has been described as an advocate of Panbabylonism.\n\nIn his pamphlet \"Hat der Jesus der Evangelien wirklich gelebt?\" (1910), he contended that the historicity of Jesus was a myth based upon the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\nJensen's theories were largely criticized by Biblical scholars and theologians.\n\n\n"}

Crippen received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.\n\nCrippen was born September 11, 1937, in Beaumont, Texas. After graduating from New Caney High School in New Caney, Texas in 1955, Crippen received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1960. He was selected as a member of the Texas Alpha chapter of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Gamma Tau.\n\nCrippen was commissioned through the United States Navy's Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) Program at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. He continued his flight training at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, Florida, and went from there to Naval Air Station Chase Field in Beeville, Texas, where he received his wings. As a Naval Aviator from June 1962 to November 1964, he made two deployments aboard the aircraft carrier USS \"Independence\", flying the A-4 Skyhawk in Attack Squadron 72 (VA-72). He later attended the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Upon graduation he remained at Edwards as an instructor until he was picked for the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) spaceflight program in October 1966.\n\nHe has logged more than 6,500 hours flying time, which includes more than 5,500 hours in jet aircraft.\n\nAfter the MOL program was cancelled, Crippen became a NASA astronaut in September 1969. He served on the astronaut support crew for the Skylab 2, Skylab 3, and Skylab 4 missions, and for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission. He was the Pilot of the first orbital test flight of the Space Shuttle program (STS-1, April 12–14, 1981) and was the Commander of three additional Shuttle flights: STS-7, June 18–24, 1983; STS-41-C, April 6–13, 1984; and STS-41-G, October 6–13, 1984. In addition to participating in the first Shuttle flight, he also presided over the first five-person crew (STS-7, which included Sally Ride, the first American woman in space), the first satellite repair operation (STS-41-C, which repaired the Solar Maximum Mission satellite), and the first seven-person crew (STS-41-G). He was named Commander of the STS-62-A mission which would have launched from the new SLC-6 facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. That mission was cancelled after the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster and SLC-6 was closed when the Air Force went back to launching satellites on the Titan III and Titan IV rockets.\n\nCrippen was stationed at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, from July 1987 to December 1989, as Deputy Director, Shuttle Operations for NASA Headquarters. He was responsible for final Shuttle preparation, mission execution and return of the orbiter to KSC after landings at Edwards Air Force Base. From January 1990 to January 1992, he served as Director, Space Shuttle, at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. As such, he was responsible for the overall Shuttle program requirements, performance, and total program control, including budget, schedule and program content. He subsequently served as the Director of the Kennedy Space Center from January 1992 to January 1995.\n\nSTS-1: \"Columbia\" (April 12–14, 1981) was the first orbital test flight of the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\". It was also the first manned vehicle to be flown into orbit without previous unmanned orbital testing and the first winged manned vehicle to launch with solid rocket boosters. It was also the first winged reentry vehicle to return to a conventional runway landing. The mission lasted 54 hours, 20 minutes, 53 seconds.\n\nSTS-7: \"Challenger\" (June 18–24, 1983) was the second flight for the Orbiter \"Challenger\". This was also the first mission with a five-person crew. During the six-day flight, the crew deployed satellites for Canada (ANIK C-2) and Indonesia (PALAPA B-1); operated the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise with the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS-01); conducted the first formation flying of the orbiter with a free-flying satellite (SPAS-02); carried and operated the first U.S./German cooperative materials science payload (OSTA-2); and operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR) experiments, in addition to activating seven Getaway Specials. Mission duration was 146 hours, 23 minutes, 59 seconds.\n\nSTS-41-C: \"Challenger\" (April 6–13, 1984) was a seven-day mission during which the crew deployed the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF); retrieved the ailing Solar Maximum Satellite, repaired it aboard the orbiting \"Challenger\", and replaced it in orbit using the robot arm called the Remote Manipulator System (RMS); flight tested the Manned Maneuvering Units (MMU's) in two extravehicular activities (EVA); as well as operating the Cinema 360 and IMAX Camera Systems, and running a Bee Hive Honeycomb Structures student experiment. Mission duration was 167 hours, 40 minutes, 07 seconds.\n\nSTS-41-G: \"Challenger\" (October 5–13, 1984) was the first mission with a seven-person crew.

After three months with the LSP, in January 1995, he and his partner are tasked with investigating a series of brutal, bizarre murders. A haunted, solitary cynic, Cohle believes that life is meaningless, human beings are merely \"sentient meat\", and hope is self-delusion. Cohle spends his free time obsessing over every detail of the crime, hoarding evidence in a storage locker and keeping extensive notes in a ledger, which earns him the derisive nickname \"The Taxman\" among his colleagues.\n\nThe series gradually reveals Cohle's backstory. He was born in South Texas but raised in Alaska by his father after his parents divorced. He became a police detective in his 20s. Years before the main story arc, his two-year-old daughter, Sophia, was killed in a car accident, a tragedy that destroyed his marriage. Devastated by the loss, Cohle grew ever more unstable and unpredictable in his work, eventually killing a crystal meth addict who had injected his own child with the drug. His superiors offered him a chance to avoid prison by working as an undercover narcotics detective, which he did for four years; Cohle notes that this was twice as long as most undercover detectives are kept in rotation. During this assignment, Cohle became addicted to drugs, and eventually killed three cartel members in a shootout, while being shot multiple times himself.\n\nDuring his recovery, he was committed to a mental hospital in Lubbock, Texas. Upon his release, he was offered retirement with full pension, but he declined that offer in favor of transferring to a homicide division. His superiors then transferred him to Louisiana. In Louisiana, he lives alone and has no friends, living only for his work. He tries to remain sober, but he occasionally falls off the wagon because of the stress of his job and his grief for his daughter. Cohle also has synesthesia and suffers from flashbacks from his drug-using years as an undercover cop.\n\nThe series takes place in two time periods: 1995–2002, in which Cohle and Hart work together to find the killer; and 2012, when Cohle, who has by now quit the police force and become an alcoholic, submits to an interview with Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough (Michael Potts) and Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles) regarding the murders. Cohle sees through the detectives, and realizes that they think he is the killer.\n\nCohle and Hart are assigned to investigate a murder in which the killer raped and tortured the victim, Dora Lange, and attached a pair of antlers to her head after killing her. They find Lange's diary, which contains repeated references to \"Carcosa\" and a \"Yellow King\". In the wreckage of a burnt-out church Lange attended, they find a wall painting depicting a human figure wearing deer antlers.\n\nCohle and Hart work the case for three months, during which they trace the murder to Reggie Ledoux (Charles Halford), a former cellmate of Lange's ex-husband. To find more information, Cohle infiltrates a biker gang with ties to Ledoux, posing as a drug dealer representing a cartel in Mexico. He assists the gang in a home invasion so he can arrest the ringleader, Ginger (Joseph Sikora), and force him to lead them to Ledoux, who cooks meth for the biker gang. During the home invasion, a shootout ensues in which several people are killed. Ginger takes Cohle to meet Ledoux's cousin and \"cook partner\", Dewall (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson). The meeting does not go well, but Hart follows Dewall to Ledoux's meth lab and calls Cohle to tell him where it is. There, Hart and Cohle discover that Ledoux has kidnapped and tortured two children, and Hart kills Ledoux in a fit of rage as Cohle looks on. Dewall, meanwhile, is killed after he runs off and blows up on one of his own homemade mines. Cohle stages evidence to support Hart's story that Ledoux opened fire on them, forcing Hart to kill him in self-defense. The two are hailed as heroes, and receive commendations and promotions.\n\nIn 2002, Cohle interrogates a suspect who reveals that Ledoux and Dewall did not act alone. He tells Cohle that he will give them information about the \"Yellow King\" in return for a plea deal. Cohle wants to investigate this lead further, but the suspect kills himself in his cell that night, after receiving a phone call. Cohle becomes obsessed with reopening the case, and pursues several leads, including a private Christian school run by Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle (Jay O. Sanders) that had been closed amid rumors of child molestation. Tuttle complains to Cohle's superiors, who suspend Cohle without pay and order him to leave the case closed. That night, Hart's wife Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) shows up at Cohle's apartment and seduces him in order to get back at Hart for repeatedly cheating on her. Hart finds out and gets into a fistfight with Cohle in front of the entire department. Cohle quits the force the same day, and becomes a drifter and an alcoholic, supporting himself as a part-time bartender.\nIn 2012, murders similar to those from 1995 begin again, Cohle is seen in the vicinity of the body, arousing the suspicion of Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania. They believe that Cohle was the killer in 1995, because he led Hart to every lead they had and seemed to know everything about the killer's frame of mind. Gilbough and Papania now believe that Cohle is committing the new murders as well. They interview Cohle and Hart, who both refuse to cooperate once the purpose of the interview becomes clear.\n\nCohle meets with Hart and tells him that he has found evidence leading to the killer. Hart is skeptical, and still resentful of Cohle for having sex with Maggie, but Cohle convinces him to help with the investigation by showing him a videotape he stole from Rev. Tuttle's home. The video is over 20 years old, and shows numerous masked men raping and torturing Marie Fontenot, a missing child whose name had come up in their investigation 17 years earlier. Cohle and Hart track down the original case's chief investigating officer, Steve Geraci (Michael Harney), and interrogate him at gunpoint. Geraci tells them that his superior, the late Sheriff Ted Childress, ordered him to halt the investigation; Childress was one of Tuttle's relatives. They soon discover that the Tuttle and Childress families — to whom both Reggie and Dewall Ledoux belong — are related, and have long histories of child abuse and murder. They ultimately discover that the killer is a Childress, and go to the late sheriff's home to investigate.\n\nCohle and Hart go to the Childress house, where they find that the sheriff's son, Errol (Glenn Fleshler), is the killer, and discover the remains of his father tied up in a shed. They also encounter Betty Childress (Ann Dowd), his mentally disabled half-sister, with whom he is having an incestuous relationship. Cohle pursues Childress into the catacombs behind the house, which Childress identifies as Carcosa. Cohle discovers an idol draped in yellow and covered in skulls — the \"Yellow King\" — and has a hallucination of a spiraling vortex, the same vortex that had been drawn on many of the victims over the past 17 years. Childress stabs Cohle in the gut and also attacks Hart, but Cohle saves his partner by shooting Childress in the head, killing him. Gilborough and Papania, whom Hart had called, arrive at the scene. With the evidence Hart and Cohle collected, they connect Childress to dozens of murders, including Dora Lange's.\n\nCohle falls into a coma, during which he feels the loving presence of his father and daughter. He later wakes up in hospital and leaves with Hart, and tells him that, \"Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning.\"\n\nMcConaughey received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Cohle, and has won and been nominated for several awards, including:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "273528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273528", "title": "Te Ruki Kawiti", "text": "Te Ruki Kawiti\n\nTe Ruki Kawiti (1770s – 5 May 1854) was a prominent Māori rangatira (chief). He and Hōne Heke successfully fought the British in the Flagstaff War in 1845–46.\n\nHe traced descent from Rāhiri and Nukutawhiti of the \"Ngātokimatawhaorua\" canoe, the ancestors of the Ngāpuhi.\nHe was born in the north of New Zealand into the Ngāti Hine hapu, one of the subtribes of the Ngāpuhi. From his youth he was trained in leadership and warfare by Hongi Hika. He was present at the Battle of Moremonui in 1807 or 1808 when many Ngāpuhi were slaughtered by Ngāti Whātua. Almost twenty years later, in 1825, he was at the Battle of Te Ika-a-ranga-nui when it was Ngāpuhi's turn to slaughter Ngāti Whātua in an act of utu or revenge. He took a number of Ngāti Whātua captive and refused to hand them over to Hongi Hika, preferring instead to return them to their own people to whom he was related.\n\nKawiti initially refused to sign the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840, believing that it would inevitably lead to further European encroachment and the loss of Māori land. However he eventually yielded to pressure from his own people and signed the Treaty in May 1840, right at the top, above those chiefs who had signed earlier.\n\nHowever he soon grew disenchanted with British law and supported Hōne Heke in his protests against British rule. Hōne Heke sought support from Kawiti and other leaders of the Ngāpuhi iwi by the conveying of ‘te ngākau’, the custom observed by those who sought help to settle a tribal grievance.\n\nHōne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti worked out the plan to draw the Colonial forces into battle, with the opening provocations focusing on the flagstaff on Maiki Hill at the north end Kororāreka. When in March 1845 Heke cut down the flag pole at Kororāreka for the fourth time, thereby initiating the Flagstaff War, Kawiti, now in his seventies, created a diversion by attacking the town.\n\nThe Māori warriors followed their chief and would fight in separate groups; however Kawiti and Heke co-ordinated their tactics at each battle. The conduct of the Flagstaff War appears to follow a strategy of drawing the Colonial forces into attacking a fortified pā, from which the warriors could fight from a strong defensive position that was secure from cannon fire. Kawiti was the senior rangatira and appears to have had a key role in the strategic decisions as to the design of the strengthened defences of Pene Taui's pā at Ohaeawai and the design and construction of the new pā that was built at Ruapekapeka to engage the British forces.\n\nAfter the Battle of Kororāreka, Heke and Kawiti and the warriors travelled inland to Lake Omapere near to Kaikohe some , or two days travel, from the Bay of Islands. Tamati Waka Nene built a pā close to Lake Omapere. Heke's pā named Puketutu, was away, while it is sometimes named as “Te Mawhe” however the hill of that name is some distance to the north-east. In April 1845, during the time that the colonial forces were gathering in the Bay of Islands, the warriors of Heke and Nene fought many skirmishes on the small hill named Taumata-Karamu that was between the two pās and on open country between Okaihau and Te Ahuahu. Heke's force numbered about three hundred men; Kawiti joined Heke towards the end of April with another hundred and fifty warriors. Among Kawiti's supporters was his nephew Reweti Maika. Opposing Heke and Kawiti were about four hundred warriors that supported Tamati Waka Nene including the chiefs, Makoare Te Taonui and his son Aperahama Taonui, Mohi Tawhai, Arama Karaka Pi, and Nōpera Panakareao.\n\nThe first major engagement of the Flagstaff War was the attack on Heke's Pā at Puketutu in May 1845 by the colonial forces led by Lt Col William Hulme. While Heke occupied the pā itself, Kawiti and his warriors arrived at the battle and engaged with the Colonial forces in the scrub and gullies around the pā. They successfully prevented the Colonial forces from launching a coordinated attack on the pā but at quite a heavy cost in casualties. The Colonial forces were unable to overcome the defences of the pā and retreated back to the Bay of Islands.\n\nThe next major engagement was the Battle of Te Ahuahu. The contemporary European accounts of the battle describe it as being fought on 12 June 1845 nearby Te Ahuahu and that it involve only the warriors of Hōne Heke fighting the warriors of Tāmati Wāka Nene. However, there are no detailed accounts of the action; Hugh Carleton (1874) mentions\n\nThomas Walker was a name adopted by Tāmati Wāka Nene. In this battle Nene's warriors carried the day. Heke was severely wounded and did not rejoin the conflict until some months later, at the closing phase of the Battle of Ruapekapeka. On this account of the early engagements of the Flagstaff War, Kawiti appears to have made the better strategic decisions as to which battles to fight and which not to fight.\n\nA debate occurred between Kawiti and the Ngatirangi chief Pene Taui as to the site of the next battle; Kawiti eventually agreed to the request to fortify Pene Taui’s Pā at Ohaeawai.\n\nThe Colonial forces arrived before the Ohaeawai Pā on 23 June and established a camp about away. On the summit of a nearby hill (Puketapu) they built a four gun battery. They opened fire next day and continued until dark but did very little damage to the palisade. The next day the guns were brought to within of the pā. The bombardment continued for another two days but still did very little damage. Partly this was due to the elasticity of the flax covering the palisade but the main fault was a failure to concentrate the cannon fire on one area of the defences.\n\nAfter two days of bombardment without effecting a breach, Lieutenant Colonel Despard ordered a frontal assault. He was, with difficulty, persuaded to postpone this pending the arrival of a 32-pound naval gun which came the next day, 1 July. However an unexpected sortie from the pā resulted in the temporary occupation of the knoll on which Tāmati Wāka Nene had his camp and the capture of Nene's colours - the Union Flag. The Union Flag was carried into the pā. There it was hoisted, upside down, and at half-mast high, below the Māori flag, which was a Kākahu (Māori cloak). This insulting display of the Union Jack was the cause of the disaster which ensued. Infuriated by the insult to the Union Jack, Despard ordered an assault upon the pā the same day. The attack was directed to the section of the pā where the angle of the palisade allowed a double flank from which the defenders of the pā could fire at the attackers; the attack was a reckless endeavour. The British persisted in their attempts to storm the unbreached palisades and five to seven minutes later 33 were dead and 66 injured.\n\nTowards the end of 1845 the British launched a major expedition against Kawiti's new pā at Ruapekapeka. It took two weeks to bring the heavy guns into range of the pā, they started the cannon bombardment on 27 December 1845.The siege continued for some two weeks with enough patrols and probes from the pā to keep everyone alert. Then, early in the morning of Sunday, 11 January 1846, Tāmati Wāka Nene's men discovered that the pā appeared to have been abandoned; although Te Ruki Kawiti and a few of his warriors remained behind, and appeared to have been caught unaware by the British assault. Fighting took place behind the pā and most casualties occurred in this phase of the battle.\n\nThe reason why the defenders appeared to have abandoned but then re-entered the pā is the subject of continuing debate. It was later suggested that most of the Māori had been at church, many of them were devout Christians. Knowing that their opponents, the British, were also Christians they had not expected an attack on a Sunday.\n\nIt was Māori custom that the place of a battle where blood was spilt became tapu so that the Ngāpuhi left Ruapekapeka Pā. After the battle Kawiti and his warriors, carrying their dead, travelled some four miles north-west to Waiomio, the ancestral home of the Ngāti Hine. After the battle of Ruapekapeka Kawiti expressed the will to continue to fight, however Kawiti and Heke made it known that they would end the rebellion if the Colonial forces would leave the Ngāpuhi land.Tāmati Wāka Nene acted as the intermediary in the negotiations, with Nene persuading the Governor to accept the terms of Kawiti and Heke - that they were to be unconditionally pardoned for their rebellion.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Flagstaff War Kawiti went to live near by Henry Williams at Pakaraka. Kawiti was baptised by Henry Williams in 1853. He died at Waiomio, near Kawakawa on 5 May 1854, The meeting house and marae complex at Waiomio Caves are his memorial.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Flagstaff War, the Hokianga and the Bay of Islands region was nominally under British influence; the fact that the government's flag was not re-erected was symbolically very significant. Such significance was not lost on Henry Williams, who, writing to E. G. Marsh on 28 May 1846, stated that \"the flag-staff in the Bay is still prostrate, and the natives here rule. These are humiliating facts to the proud Englishman, many of whom thought they could govern by a mere name.\"\n\nSome argue that the Flagstaff War can be considered an inconclusive stalemate, as both sides wished the war to end, both gained somewhat from the fighting, and the situation more or less remained the same as it was before the outbreak of hostilities. The opinion of Henry Williams, who had counseled Kawiti to abandon the rebellion, was that the Ngāpuhi and the colonial government both agreed that each should let the other alone, so that Kawiti achieved peace on his terms. Henry Williams wrote to his son-in-law Hugh Carleton on 13 March 1854 in response to an earlier comment by Carleton as to the consequences of Kawiti having made peace with Governor Grey:\n\nUpon the death of Kawiti, his son Maihi Paraone Kawiti, who had been a missionary teacher at Mangakahia, succeeded Kawiti as leader of the Ngāti Hine hapu. Maihi Paraone Kawiti was a supporter of te ture (the law) and te whakapono (the gospel). Deputations came to Maihi Paraone Kawiti from the Taranaki and Waikato iwi asking the Ngāpuhi to join the Māori King Movement; the reply from Maihi Paraone Kawiti was that the Ngāpuhi had no desire for a ‘Māori Kingi’ as ‘Kuini Wikitoria’ was their ‘Kingi'.\n\nMaihi Paraone Kawiti, as a signal to Governor Thomas Gore Browne that he did not follow his father’s path, arranged for the fifth flagpole to be erected at Kororāreka; this occurred in January 1858 with the flag being named Whakakotahitanga, “being at one with the Queen.” As a further symbolic act, the 400 Ngāpuhi warriors involved in preparing and erecting the flagpole were selected from the ‘rebel’ forces of Kawiti and Heke – that is, Ngāpuhi from the hapu of Tāmati Wāka Nene (who had fought as allies of the British forces during the Flagstaff War), observed, but did not participate in the erection of the fifth flagpole. The restoration of the flagpole was presented by Maihi Paraone Kawiti as a voluntary act on the part of the Ngāpuhi that had cut it down in 1845, and they would not allow any other to render any assistance in this work.\n\nThe legacy of Kawiti’s rebellion during the Flagstaff War was that during the time of Governor Grey and Governor Thomas Gore Browne, the colonial administrators were obliged to take account of opinions of the Ngāpuhi before taking actions in the Hokianga and Bay of Islands. The continuing symbolism of the fifth flagpole at Kororāreka is that it exists because of the goodwill of the Ngāpuhi.\n"}

For some 30 years he campaigned within Traditionalism and Carlism. Periodically he was holding regional party leadership jobs, though nationwide he remained rather in the back row. He is best known as member of the first Junta Política and Consejo Nacional, executive bodies of the newly created Francoist state party, Falange Española Tradicionalista.\n\nThe Dolz lineage is related to Southern Aragón; its first representatives were noted in the late 12th century, once the successful Reconquista claimed Teruel. The family was initially linked to Albarracín, over time spreading to neighboring counties. The Espejo lineage originated from Northern parts of Kingdom of Valencia, resident in . The two families intermarried in the early 17th century, giving rise to the Dolz de Espejo branch. Many of its members made their names in history of Spain; Tomás’ great-grandfather, Pedro Federico Dolz de Espejo, was awarded the title of Conde de la Florida in 1789.\n\nHis son, the 2nd Count and the grandfather of Tomás, Pedro Pablo Dolz de Espejo, distinguished himself during the Napoleonic era. At the outbreak of the First Carlist War in 1833 he sided with the legitimists; following defeat he went into exile and died in 1842 in Bordeaux. His son and Tomás’ father, Pedro Manuel Dolz de Espejo (1820-1879), as 3rd Count returned to Spain re-assuming family landholdings in Teruel. He joined the Carlist conspiracy too, during Third Carlist War entrusted with economic issues; it was his signature present on banknotes, issued by the Carlists. He too went into exile, settling in Bayonne. He married a girl from another aristocratic Aragón family, María Andreu y Duforq-Salinis (1843-1920).\n\nBetween 1876 and 1879 the couple had 3 children; Tomás was born in France as the younger of two sons. It is not clear when the widow and half-orphans returned to Spain; she is first noted back in the family palace in Teruel in 1888. None of the sources consulted provides information on early years of Tomás, except that he was brought up in \"escuela de la lealtad y sacrificio\". It is neither clear where he received his education; because he was later referred to as \"engineer\" he probably studied technology, possibly in Madrid. At unspecified time in the 1900s he engaged in construction; in 1911 he was noted as manager of a Madrid-based company, La Constructora. In 1912 he was referred to as \"propietario\"; he took over the family business in 1913, following premature and childless death of his older brother, the 4th Count; he also inherited the title.\n\nIn 1912 Tomás Dolz married María de la Estrella González de la Riva Vidiella (1882-1989), daughter to teniente coronel de artillería 9th . The couple settled in Madrid at Conde Aranda; they had 3 children, born between 1913 and 1914. None of them became a public figure, though the only son, Carlos Dolz de Espejo y González de la Riva (1913-2013), an air force general, briefly gained media attention in relation to the most famous Spanish UFO incident of 1976. A younger daughter, María, married Antonio Galbis Loriga, Conde de Morphy, general de artillería and ayudante honoríficio to Franco. Among numerous grandchildren of Tomás and María, the best known ones are Carlos Dolz de Espejo y Arrospide, businessman and the 7th Conde de la Florida, and Alfonso Galbis Dolz de Espejo, a painter.\n\nWith two generations of ancestors serving the legitimist cause Dolz seemed poised to follow suit, especially that also his mother came from a Traditionalist family. However, during his youth Traditionalism was divided into mainstream Carlists and the breakaway Integrists. His brother, only 2 years senior, sided with the rebels; as a 16-year-old in 1893 he publicly voiced support for the Nocedalistas. In course of the 1890s Pedro Dolz de Espejo grew in the Integrist structures, in 1900 rising to president of the Valencian Junta Provincial and in 1907 entering the executive of Valencian Junta Regional. However, none of the sources consulted confirms (or denies) that Tomás followed his older brother; until the early 1910s he is not recorded as engaged in politics.\n\nDolz was first noted in political milieu in 1911; he demonstrated support to Traditionalist deputies from both the Integrist and Jaimist minorities, who in the Cortes in vain tried to block . In 1912 he was admitted to , a theoretically non-political but in fact highly conservative aristocratic organization. Following death of his older brother he became a somewhat prestigious figure in the Teruel realm and as such decided to join the electoral race: in 1914 he ran to the Cortes from Mora de Rubielos, a district in the Teruel province; it was also the first time he declared himself a Jaimista, member of Carlist branch supporting the claim of Don Jaime. The attempt proved premature and he lost pathetically, gaining 10 times fewer votes than a victorious candidate. Following the defeat Florida is never confirmed to have renewed his bid for the parliament.\n\nIn the mid-1910s Florida, already referred to in the press as \"rico propietario\", was already fully engaged in the Jaimista structures. In 1915 he was rumored to be running in the Cortes elections of the following year from the Madrid Latina district; the news eventually proved false, though in 1916 he was busy mounting an electoral alliance which would include even the Traditionalist arch-enemies, the Liberals. In 1917 he worked to seal an electoral union of the Jaimists, the Integrists, the Maurists and independent candidates, to be fielded in the forthcoming electoral campaign. He rose to first secretary of the Madrid municipal Jaimist organization, in 1918 growing to its jefe and soon also jefe of the provincial Madrid structures, though in general remained a back-row party figure.\n\nThough he seemed perfectly loyal to Don Jaime, in the new internal conflict within Carlism Florida tended rather to side with its key theorist, Juan Vázquez de Mella. This was demonstrated not only by Mellista-typical penchant for right-wing alliances, but also by advocating neutralist stand in the Great War, a strategy intended to counter pro-Entente feelings and effectively supporting the Central Powers. Florida was not among chief protagonists of the strife and remained in the background; however, when in 1919 Vázquez de Mella broke away and set up his own party, Dolz de Espejo decided to join him.\n\nIn 1920 Florida joined a 3-member Mellista Castilla La Nueva executive; in 1921 he assumed the position of Jefe Provincial in Madrid and honorary president of the Madrid branch of the party youth, Juventud Católica Tradicionalista. Reported as engaged in a variety of initiatives – setting up new cinemas in Madrid, collecting money for religious purposes, donating and organizing donations to army operations in Morocco, taking part in Catholic ceremonies, supporting sports- he was not, however, noted as busy building the party structures. In 1922 he attended a general Mellista assembly, taking place in Zaragoza and supposed to finalize buildup of the new party. The assembly launched Comité Directivo of the newly formed Partido Tradicionalista; Florida was one of its 3 members. He was also confirmed as the Madrid Jefe Provincial, temporarily given command of \"provincias del Centro, Sur y Oeste de España\". The Mellista project hardly took off the ground when the 1923 coup of Miguel Primo de Rivera banned all political parties in the country.\n\nFlorida withdrew to privacy, in public noted for charity and glamour of aristocratic societé. Resident of Madrid, he was spending strings at his La Florida property in Teruel and in estates in Valencia. Fascinated by cars he managed a Sitges circuit, excelled in Real Automovil Club and co-ran a tourist review; owner of a new Buick, he was fined for excessive driving until his car was stolen. Excluding landholding properties, he lived off a number of enterprises; apart from construction company he was president of Sociedad Española de Talcos and Compañia de Seguros Omnia. During Dolz renewed political endeavors. In May 1930 he was received by Alfonso XIII. Against the rising Republican tide he stood on monarchist ground, cultivating old-style patriotism. Having joined , in April 1931 he ran on its ticket in elections for the Madrid ayuntamiento.\n\nUpon declaration of the Republic Florida tried to transfer his capital abroad. Apprehended by the customs service he was detained and possibly suffered forfeiture of some of the assets smuggled. At unspecified time he returned to Carlist loyalty by entering , which in 1932 re-joined the former Jaimistas, Integristas and Mellistas. In 1933 he was appointed its Jefe Regional of Castilla La Nueva. Despite holding a theoretically prestigious position, Florida did not seem particularly active; he was seldom recorded as speaking at party meetings and historians almost do not mention his name when discussing Carlist activities during the Republic. It is not clear what his position was on controversial question of alliances with other monarchist and Right-wing groupings or on internal leadership rivalry between Conde de Rodezno and Manuel Fal. In 1935 the latter triggered his nomination to Junta de Hacienda, a body entrusted with organizing funds for the Comunión.\n\nIt is not clear whether Florida was engaged in Carlist preparations to the July 1936 coup; in particular there is no information whether he opted for unconditional alliance with the military or rather for negotiating terms and conditions. It is neither known where he was during the first days of the fighting. Later Francoist propaganda claimed that from the onset Florida acted as member of Junta Carlista de Guerra del Reino de León; the first confirmed information is that in September he emerged in Ciudad Rodrigo, busy organizing Requeté; in October his León efforts gained him a letter of thanks from the new Carlist regent, Don Javier. Though he is not listed as member of the national Carlist wartime executive, Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra, residing in Salamanca he started to take part in meetings of the Comunión leaders. For reasons which are not entirely clear his position grew; perhaps as a host Florida presided over a Carlist emergency meeting of December 1936, called to deal with Franco’s demand that Fal Conde leaves Spain. It is not clear what position he took; some historians discussing the day refer to him as \"Rodezno’s ally\", which suggests that Florida proposed that the ultimatum be accepted.\n\nStarting early 1937 the Carlists were facing a prospect of forced amalgamation into a state party; the claimant and the Falcondistas opted for intransigence, Rodezno and the Navarrese opted for negotiations. Florida was present at a February meeting in Insua and sided with the Rodeznistas, position maintained also in March. In early April he took part in a meeting of a somewhat rebellious Navarrese Junta Central; it adopted a Franco-addressed proposal suggesting a directorio, composed of Carlists, Falangists and caudillo’s appointees. In mid-April he was one of 4 Carlists summoned to Burgos; generalísimo informed them about forthcoming political unification. It is not clear why he was picked up by Franco; some suggest that Florida was among most \"conspicuous\" Carlists because of his Requeté recruitment activities.\n\nAt that time Franco and his aides were already considering personal composition of executive of the state party just to be announced. Florida was not among the Carlists initially marked; presented by Franco with shortlisted candidates, Rodezno suggested that Marcelino Ulibarri is dropped and one more seat is reserved for the Carlists, coming with the names of Florida and José María Mazón. The proposal was accepted and on April 22 Dolz found himself among 4 Carlists nominated to a 10-member \"Secretariado o Junta Política\" of Falange Española Tradicionalista. Of all its members he was perhaps the least-known one; among press-published short notes about the appointees, his was the shortest one. greatly disappointed many Carlists, including some of the Junta appointees; the regent was furious. In June the Carlist junteros asked him to authorize their presence in the Junta, but to no avail; later on all were expulsed from Comunión for breach of loyalty.\n\nFrustrated by lack of the Falangist give and take in the Junta, some Carlists complained to Franco; the result were October 1937 nominations to another party body, a 50-member Consejo Nacional. Florida found himself among 12 Carlist nominees and was already firmly mounted among highest-positioned civilians of the Francoist Spain, sitting in two bodies directing the only political organization allowed in the state. However, many historians agree that both executive structures were rather decorative and that the entire party was at that stage a nascent structure, called into being to ensure that power stays with Franco and yet to acquire its later dynamics. Moreover, the Carlists were enraged to find that what they supposed to be an organization they could control or at least influence was increasingly turning into a new version of Falange, with syndicalist blue-shirts systematically gaining the upper hand. Following unification Carlist rank-and-file started to bombard their leaders in Junta and in Consejo with complaints about getting sidetracked, asking for support. As recipient of these notes and phone calls Florida is recorded as pledging support; it is not clear whether he indeed intervened, though it is clear that nothing changed.\n\nThroughout most of the Civil War in public Florida maintained a loyal Francoist stand. In newspapers he was quoted arguing in favor of the unification; according to him both Carlism and Falange were anti-democratic, anti-Liberal, anti-parliamentarian and Catholic, he claimed also that both supported monarchist solution, to be implemented in the future. Apparently he also tried to cultivate the Traditionalist format as much as he could, with some other FET executives attending sermons honoring Carlist kings Carlos VII and Alfonso Carlos or taking part in annual Carlist feast dedicated to Mártires de la Tradición, initially observed by the state party. On the other hand, he did not refrain from attending new-style events, like banquets in the Nazi headquarters in Salamanca. In 1938 he acted as FET Jefe Provincial in Salamanca, typically one of the 3 most important civilian positions in every province; it is not clear what exact dates of his term were.\n\nFlorida’s career at the top of the Francoist political strata came to the end in late summer of 1939. As late as in August he was still reported taking part in public events as consejero nacional, but this changed in September; he did not find himself among appointees to the II Consejo Nacional and starting 1940 he was reported in the press simply as \"Conde de la Florida\". None of the sources consulted offers any insight into his departure from the party executive, and specifically whether it was a fall from grace or a conscious decision to withdraw. It could have been resignation following disappointment with the syndicalist format of the new party; it could have been marginalization suffered as a result of an internal conflict, as it happened with Joaquín Bau, another Carlist sidetracked by Ramón Serrano Suñer, especially that Florida publicly kept declaring inevitable restoration of the monarchy.\n\nNo longer in the top political flight, in the early 1940s Florida was still present in public life, e.g. taking part in Traditionalism-flavored feasts attended by some FET heavyweights. In 1942 he was not appointed to the III Consejo Nacional and his political career seemed definitely over. This might not have been exactly the case, as in 1944 he was reported among governmental officials, namely noted as subsecretario de industria. This was, however, definitely the last of his Francoist episodes; afterwards he was no longer mentioned related either to the party or to the government. He did not accept an olive branch from Carlism; in 1942 Fal declared that all those stained by Falangism might be re-admitted given they abandon their state party links; the offer explicitly excluded from the scheme some of the leaders, but Florida was not among them. In the late 1940s he ventured to publicly demonstrate support for Ricardo Oreja, his old-time fellow Mellista, when the latter succeeded in Madrid municipal elections.\n\nThough already at the retirement age, Florida remained active in a number of enterprises, mostly related to mineral resources and dependent businesses, like construction or pharmaceuticals; some of them, like RUMHE, landed hefty contracts in prestigious locations, like the Madrid Gran Vía. In the 1950s he regularly featured in societé columns, attending aristocratic feasts related and unrelated to his own family. His political engagements were almost inexistent, except that he kept attending the Mártires de la Tradición sermons. This changed abruptly in the mid-1950s. In 1956 Florida was awarded Gran Cruz del Mérito Civil, a very prestigious Francoist honor. In 1957 he was among 70-odd Carlists who concluded their longtime rapprochement with the Alfonsist claimant, Don Juan. Satisfied that formal acceptance of Traditionalist principles rendered him fit for succession also from the Carlist perspective, they declared him the legitimate heir to the throne. Florida, one of the most distinguished of the so-called \"Estorilos\", entered the claimant’s Consejo Privado, the post retained until the end of his life.\n\nAlso as an octogenarian Florida kept attending social events, at times assuming unlikely roles; in 1962 he formed part of a jury at a female beauty contest. He remained engaged in religious activities, in particular in ranks of Hermandad de Caballeros de San Juan Bautista y Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes; occasionally he presided over charity initiatives. Cautiously he kept admitting Traditionalist heritage; apart from cultural events like those dedicated to memory of Vázquez de Mella in the late 1960s he engaged in Hermandad de Cristo Rey de Requetés ex Combatientes, formally an organisation of Carlist Civil War combatants though in practice a Traditionalist bulwark in internal Carlist strife, aimed against a newly emergent progressist faction; nothing indicates he was aware of the background and historians extensively discussing internal fragmentation of Carlism in the 1960s and 1970s do not mention his name. Also in the late 1960s he kept cultivating the Juanista link; in the 1970s he was noted only as attending weddings of his grandchildren.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23999798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23999798", "title": "Wrongful conviction of Steve Titus", "text": "Wrongful conviction of Steve Titus\n\nThe wrongful conviction of Steve Titus was a miscarriage of justice in which Steve Titus (1950–1986), an American businessman, was wrongly convicted of rape. Titus was fired from his job after the conviction and, though the charges were soon dismissed, he became long term unemployed. The crime was later determined to have been committed by serial rapist Edward Lee King. Journalist Paul Henderson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for his work on the case. Jack Olsen's book \"Predator\" examined the investigation of the crime and the life of the real criminal.\n\nOn October 12, 1980, a female hitchhiker was raped in SeaTac, Washington. The assault took place south of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on land owned by the Port of Seattle. Port of Seattle Police described the rapist as 25 to 30 years old, driving a royal blue car with temporary license plates and cloth seats, and having a beard. The rape was reported to have taken place at 6:45 p.m. The victim walked to a nearby house, and after approximately 10 minutes of conversation, called the police at 7:22 p.m. There were tire prints found near the scene which matched that of a Michelin XYZ tire, which was standard on 1981 Honda Accord LX cars, a model that was first sold in September, 1980. The victim reported that there was a large brown folder in the car and that the rapist wore a three piece suit.\n\nSteve Titus was arrested and was later identified by the victim in a line-up. Like the rapist, he had a beard. He had a new car, a royal blue Chevrolet Chevette. However, the car had neither Michelin tires nor cloth seats. The car had a large brown folder which Titus later claimed was planted in the car by the police. He did not have any suits.\n\nPsychologist Elizabeth Loftus argued at trial that the victim had elicited a false memory of the attacker due to a biased line up. When shown a line up of suspects the victim had initially claimed that Steve Titus was the man who looked the most similar to the attacker. Later in court the victim said that she definitely knew it was him. Her perceptions had been changed throughout the process of going to court through cues which created a false memory.\n\nAt trial prosecution testimony was changed and evidence of innocence was explained away by prosecution experts and law enforcement officers. As a direct result, Titus was wrongly convicted of Rape in the First Degree, a crime that carried with it a mandatory prison sentence. Working with investigative reporter Paul Henderson of the Seattle Times, Titus' new attorney, Jeff Jones, whom Titus had hired to pursue an appeal of his conviction, was able to convince the trial judge to grant a new trial based upon evidence developed by Henderson, arguing that Titus' trial attorney had been ambushed by surprise testimony which directly contradicted evidence contained in the Port of Seattle Police investigative reports. Subsequently, as a result of good police work by a local municipal police officer who had been following the new articles about the case, a lead was developed as to a new suspect. That lead was followed up by the King County Sheriff's Office whose investigation led to the arrest of Edward Lee King, called by the pseudonym \"Mac Smith\" in Jack Olsen's book \"Predator: Rape, Madness, and Injustice in Seattle\", who eventually confessed to the crime.\n\nThe timeline was an important factor in the case. Titus left his parents home at 6:10 p.m on October 12, 1980 after attending his father's birthday party where there were other guests. He was seen by a coffee shop waitress at 6:20 p.m. on the day of the rape. The waitress at different times thought she had seen him at 6:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Titus made a long distance telephone call from his apartment at 7:00 p.m. on the day of the rape. The distance between the rape scene and Titus' apartment would have required a journey-time of 19½ minutes according to a Seattle Times reporter. These times would not have allowed Titus to be at the location where the victim was raped at the time she indicated the crime had occurred. He was convicted on March 4, and the conviction was overturned June 8. He only spent one night in jail after conviction.\n\nAfter charges against him were dismissed, Titus sued the Port of Seattle and its Police Department, based upon evidence that their officers had changed and planted evidence, as well as convinced the victim to alter her testimony. Just before the trial, Titus died of a heart attack. His parents settled and got $2 million to be paid over 20 years. The policeman accused of fabricating evidence died six years later of a heart attack. Paul Henderson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism for his reporting on this case and later became a private investigator specializing in freeing innocent people who have been wrongfully convicted.\n\nJack Olsen wrote a book entitled \"Predator: Rape, Madness, and Injustice in Seattle\" detailing both the railroading of Titus and the life of Edward Lee King, a convicted rapist who later confessed to this rape, and who is thought to have committed more than 50 rapes.\n\n\n"}
