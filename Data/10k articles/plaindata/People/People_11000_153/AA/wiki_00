{"id": "1216187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1216187", "title": "Agent (The Matrix)", "text": "Agent (The Matrix)\n\nAgents are a group of characters in \"The Matrix\" franchise. They are sentient computer programs carefully disguised as average-looking human males, displaying a high-level of artificial intelligence.\n\nAgents are representatives within the Matrix fictional universe. They are guardians within the computer-generated world of the Matrix, protecting it from anyone or anything (most often Redpills) that could reveal it as a false reality or threaten it in any other way.\n\nAgents also hunt down and terminate any rogue programs, such as The Keymaker, which no longer serve a purpose to the overall Machine objective. They physically appear human, but have a tendency to speak and act in highly precise and mechanical ways.\n\nAgents wear black business suits lined with a gold fabric, white dress shirts, black dress shoes, black neckties with a silver bar clip, square sunglasses, and a communication earpiece. These features are copied from the attire for plainclothes agents of the United States Secret Service, as well as those of the Men in Black conspiracy or the stereotypical G-Man/FBI official. All Agents are Caucasian males (with a minor exceptions of black Agent Perry and female Agent Pace from \"The Matrix Online\" game), which also provides a dynamic compared to the majority population of Zion, containing many diverse cultures and walks of life. With the exception of Agent Pace, Agents also tend to have common Anglo-Saxon names such as Smith, Jones, Brown, etc. They have sideburns, and their hair is either slicked back or side-parted. Matrix Agents carry Desert Eagle handguns in shoulder holsters that are concealed beneath their suit jackets. In addition to proficiency in the use of firearms, all Agents are masters of the martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. \n\nAgents are programmed with a number of superhuman abilities. An Agent's speed, agility, stamina and reflexes enable them to leap great distances such as across building rooftops, sway their body from side to side to evade gunfire, and perform unusual counter attacks in melee combat (Agent Smith managed to directly counter a punch from Morpheus with a punch of his own to Morpheus's still-moving fist). Agents possess superhuman strength, performing feats such as tearing open a car's roof with one hand and punching through solid concrete. Although they can be momentarily stunned by certain attacks (such as when Neo jabbed his fingers into Agent Smith's throat), they are generally impervious to pain and injury (the upgraded Agent that Trinity shot in the abdomen and shoulder showed no reaction of pain).\n\nIn spite of their abilities, they can be caught off guard with a point-blank contact shot aimed directly at their head or a barrage of firepower from a weapon with a high rate of fire, such as that from a “minigun”. Any trauma that is instantly lethal to a vital organ will kill an Agent.\n\nHowever, being \"killed\" is a temporary inconvenience, as Agents do not exist in their own bodies as other programs do. Rather, they take over the virtualized body of a Bluepill—a human directly connected to the Matrix—which transforms into the Agent's form until the Agent leaves the body. An Agent can jump from one body to another, either to re-emerge in the Matrix if they \"die\" (which only kills the host body) or to hunt their quarry by taking over a nearby Bluepill. For this reason, areas with a high population density (crowded apartment buildings, market places, freeways, etc.) are usually avoided by the Zion rebels, who regard every Bluepill as potential threat that could become an Agent at any time. Matrix Agents can also disguise themselves as the host body (when Agent Smith possessed the body of a Matrix SWAT soldier and used it as a disguise to locate Morpheus and his crew hiding in the walls of the bathroom). \n\nBeyond their conventional abilities, Agents possess some level of influence over the Matrix to rewrite aspects of itself. In the first film, Agent Smith was able to plant a suggestion that Neo's mouth has sealed shut which made his mouth disappear on his residual self-image (RSI), and later, the Agents changed the Matrix to trap the rebels inside a hotel by surrounding it with brick walls. It is not explained how this ability works but is most likely based on a line of communication to the Source, rather than an Agent possessing inherent access to manipulate the Matrix's source code.\n\nIn addition to their abilities, Agents possess an unspecified level of authority to command civilian law enforcement as both security and first-line enforcers: in particular, they have a heavily-armed SWAT team that serves as their building security. The Agents have branded the Zion infiltrators as terrorists, and the unassuming law enforcement officers will arrest or kill any rebels on the word of the Agents.\n\nWith the exception of Smith, who seems intellectually superior to his colleagues (and far more ambitious), Agents show little or no emotion.\n\nIn any direct confrontation, an Agent's abilities ensure they would prevail against a normal human opponent that would eventually exhaust their own firepower, stamina, and capacity to sustain pain and injury. All Zion hovercraft crew members know that Agents are extremely dangerous and virtually impossible to eliminate; as such, they are cautioned to escape upon encountering one. According to Morpheus, in the time before Neo was freed from the Matrix, every human that had stood their ground against an Agent was killed. Morpheus and Neo both individually fought Agent Smith in the first movie, and both were defeated, only surviving because Smith needed Morpheus for questioning and Neo due to his self-realization of himself as the One. Later, once Neo had harnessed his abilities as the One, Agents no longer posed a threat to him and he could easily disintegrate Smith, scaring Agents Brown and Jones into fleeing. It is implied in the game \"Enter the Matrix\" that one of the main reasons for Neo's ability to defeat Agents was his ability to focus enough to move quickly for far longer periods than could normal rebels. This is the main cause of the player's difficulty in fighting Agents, since when the player is outside bullet time the Agents are able to dodge and counter all hand-to-hand attacks.\n\nMorpheus had been fortunate enough to survive encounters with two Agents (Smith and Johnson) throughout the trilogy. He was defeated soundly by Smith (who beat him to a bloody pulp but left him alive because he needed information from the high-ranking infiltrator), and only overcame Johnson due to the nature of their situation; he did not wear down his opponent, but merely threw him from the top of the speeding truck on which they were fighting, although he only managed to turn the tables on his foe after he was thrown off, due to the unexpected arrival of Niobe, who rescued him.\n\nNiobe has defeated an Agent, but as with Morpheus, there were extenuating circumstances. The fight took place on board a cargo plane in the skies above the Megacity; Niobe lowered the rear cargo ramp and managed to knock Agent Johnson out of the plane.\n\nGhost has also defeated a single Agent during a raid on a nuclear power plant, again by making use of unique circumstances of the encounter. Agent Johnson challenged him in the control room of the plant, whereupon he damaged one of the high-voltage servers with small arms fire and threw his opponent into it, electrocuting him.\n\nThe Oracle's bodyguard Seraph says to Smith in \"The Matrix Revolutions\": \"I have beaten you before,\" but this is not expanded upon. Smith remarks that chasing Seraph is like \"chasing a ghost,\" suggesting a lasting rivalry between the two programs. \n\nTrinity is the only other character to have \"stood up\" against an Agent and survive, given that she dispatched Agent Jones by a contact shot when he was near to killing Neo, getting in close while the Agent's attention was focused on Neo. If, as Morpheus suggests, no other human had survived an Agent encounter, this would mark the first time that an Agent had been \"defeated\", albeit the Agent's program then \"body hopped\" into another Bluepill and was fighting again within minutes.\n\nIn the first film, Agents Jones (Robert Taylor) and Brown (Paul Goddard) are credited as Agent Smith's \"sidekicks\". Smith is given at least one order (or at least a forceful suggestion) by Jones (\"order the strike\"), and there appears to be some resentment or disagreement between the three on several occasions.\n\nJones and Brown undergo little character development and do not appear in the sequels, though they are occasionally seen in \"The Matrix Online\". They are mostly silent, but brutal accomplices to Smith, who perform secondary tasks such as holding Neo in place when Smith places a tracking device (possibly a program) inside his body cavity.\n\nBrown chases Trinity across the rooftops in the opening sequence, missing several shots. Brown is also present in the scene wherein Morpheus is interrogated, injecting a truth serum into Morpheus's neck. Finally, Brown is ordered by Smith to check Neo for life signs after Smith shoots him and confirms Neo's death. Brown shows subtle hints of cynically deriding his \"superior\" Smith, such as when he seems slightly annoyed at him when they are interrogating Morpheus.\n\nJones is less prominent than Brown in the first movie, but his most notable scene is a confrontation with Neo in a rooftop fight. He then stands above the stricken Neo, uttering the line \"[o]nly human,\" before being shot by Trinity, who managed to get in close enough to shoot him in the head at point-blank range while he was occupied with Neo. From this, it can be deduced Jones perceives the human race much as Smith does, though with less unbridled revulsion. Likely as a precaution, Jones is briefly seen in the background holding Brown back when Neo is about to destroy Smith in the end of the film, and they are last seen fleeing from Neo. Jones seems slightly more jaded and bored with his tasks than the other Agents.\n\n\"The Matrix Reloaded\" introduced \"Upgraded\" Agents, Jackson, Johnson, and Thompson. Their enhanced strength, speed and stamina enable them to engage in protracted combat with Neo. In \"\", the upgraded Agents recover from violent physical injuries in a relatively short time. However, an unarmed Neo is still able to defeat them easily. \n\nThe upgraded Agents continue the use of very plain, common, Anglo-Saxon names. A difference is that now their names are all two syllables and end in \"-son\", while the original Agents had names consisting of only a short syllable. Agent Johnson appears to be the leader of the upgrades, filling the same role as Smith prior to his first \"death\". Johnson attempts to destroy the exiled Keymaker program, and fights Morpheus on top of a speeding truck.\n\nWhen Smith was destroyed by Neo at the end of \"The Matrix\", his programming instructed him to return to the Source (the Machine mainframe), either to be destroyed or stored. As a result of Neo's attack, something changed in Smith that allowed him to defy his programming. The change in Smith also disconnects him from the system, setting him \"free\" from his duties. In effect, this change makes Smith an \"Exile\" program without purpose. By copying his programming onto others, especially The Oracle, Smith develops similar qualities as the One, such as the ability to withstand dramatic damage and the power of flight. Because Smith feels that he is still a victim to \"purpose\", he thus makes it his goal to destroy both Zion and The Matrix. Beginning to behave like a virus, he makes multitudinous copies of himself by using humans and other programs in the Matrix as hosts. The copies thereafter display the memories and special abilities of any assimilated programs, such as the Oracle's ability to see the future and control over The Matrix. Smith's ability to copy himself onto others may be a corruption of his original ability to move between hosts before Neo's attack. Neo is shown to be the only person able to withstand such assimilations, Morpheus only being spared because Neo threw off the Smiths that were trying to copy over him; even the Oracle fell victim to the attack, although it apparently required greater effort on Smith's part than usual. Smith eventually assimilates the entire Matrix and is destroyed when Neo, co-operating with the Machines, allows himself to be overwritten by Smith after a protracted fight.\n\nSmith's appearance changes slightly once he loses his status as an Agent. His sunglasses take on an angular shape that is an approximation of the rounded lenses Neo uses. In addition, he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo as a warning.\nThe Twins are believed to be Agents of the second Matrix prototype: the 'Hell' Matrix. When the new Matrix versions were created, along with new versions of the Agents, the Twins were seen as worthless and were sentenced to deletion. However, they avoided deletion and become exiles/rogue programs, working for The Merovingian as bodyguards.\n\nMany other agents have appeared in the \"Animatrix\", the Matrix console games, and the Matrix comics. Agents Ash, Bird, Finn, Fine, Gray, and White are the only Agents named there, but other unnamed Agents have appeared as well.\n\nAgent White also appears in \"\" as a replacement for Smith after the latter was destroyed by Neo. White appears in only one section of the Redpill Rescue level called The Security Guard. He appears much like Agent Brown but has his own personality, and appears to be stronger than both Jones and Brown at the time as he gives Neo a fair degree of difficulty, even while Neo is the One.\n\nThe \"Animatrix\" story \"World Record\" featured a different style of Agent wearing full-length trenchcoats instead of the usual dark suit.\n\nThe Agents lived on in the film's continuation, the MMORPG \"The Matrix Online\". In line with the brokered truce created by Neo at the end of \"The Matrix Revolutions\", Agents were no longer assigned to kill redpills on sight. Instead, they guard various areas of the Matrix that are still restricted to the awakened. The Agents revert to their original programming with the collapse of the Truce.\n\nRed-Eyed \"Impostor\" Agents appeared at the start of \"The Matrix Online\" storyline during chapter 1.1. These \"agents\" impersonated system representatives and began widespread sabotage and assaults on the awakened redpills in an attempt to stress/break the truce agreement. All three major organizations (Zion, the Machines, and the Merovingian) were quick to deny being responsible for the attacks and the impostors were soon declared a fourth group unto themselves.\n\nIt was soon discovered that these beings were not agents at all, but rather were using some kind of disguise technology to try to implicate the machines for their actions. Glowing red eyes and lack of system-issue firearms were flaws in the plan.\n\nIt is revealed in a \"Report to the General\" document that the Red-Eyed Agents are the General's, the Exile who used to command the Sentinels, commandos, taking into consideration that programs could gain access to other shells (like the way the Oracle changed appearance in the movies), made occasional documented reports to the General in various Zion and Machine critical missions, and also hinted that their disguises were malfunctioning.\nGray was one of several Agents trapped in the Matrix during the infestation known as Smith. His program was overwritten with new code, executing instructions which conflicted with his primary architecture. When Smith was defeated and Smith's program was withdrawn from the system, Gray was freed.\n\nThe Machine Civilization is run by cautious protocols, and there was still some chance that the Smith code had found a place to shelter within the system, or within an RSI. Agents that had been exposed to Smith were quarantined within the Matrix during the reset – something that is usually never done. Bluepills have their connections to the system attenuated so they never notice the event, and Exiles can seek shelter in a construct, but Agents have no such recourse. Those trapped in the system during the reset were literally turned inside out as their code was deconstructed and recompiled with a vicious error-checking routine.\n\nEven afterward, he has not been allowed to return to the Source, instead relegated to a buffer system created during the reboot – a gateway construct which acts as a Machine analog to the Merovingian's Mobil Avenue Station. In some ways he is almost an Exile, but for the fact that he believes he will eventually be able to return to the Source.\n\nDue to his current situation, Agent Gray was selected to act as recruiter and Controller for human beings that the Machines believe can assist them in controlling the Matrix. Like all Agents he is normally dispassionate and aloof, with a precise manner of speaking, but his forced dealings with humans have left him with somewhat more understanding of them than most Agents.\n\nWhen dealing with humans, he uses many euphemisms, as he has found that humans often prefer not to say what they really mean. Death is \"cessation of awareness\"; stealing is \"expeditious acquisition\". He addresses humans by their gender titles and bluepill last name (e.g. \"Mister Anderson\"), and seems to have a foolproof way of knowing this information about every human to whom he speaks.\n\nThough Gray resented his assignment greatly at first, he has come to appreciate that he is better at dealing with humans than most other machine Agents. Although he does not enjoy interacting with humans, his efficiency at it gives him a sense of pride.\n\nOccasionally, a remnant of Smith's code has been known to influence his behavior, causing him to develop a misanthropic and homicidal attitude, as well as greatly increasing his power.\n\nAgent Gray is voiced by John Patrick Lowrie.\n\nAgent Pace is the first female Agent, created in \"The Matrix Online\" storyline as an attempt by the Machines to better interact with their human liaisons. Agent Pace is somewhat less stern and more personable than other Agents, and often refers to her human liaisons using Italian terms, almost verging on \"pet names\" if AI could be said to use them (similar to how the Merovingian program decided that he prefers French over other human languages, Pace likes Italian). \"Pace\" also means \"peace\" in Italian.\n\n"}

{"id": "21863411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21863411", "title": "Anastasia Prikhodko", "text": "Anastasia Prikhodko\n\nAnastasia Kostyantynivna Prikhodko (: [also spelt \"Prykhodko\"]; born April 21, 1987) is a Ukrainian folk rock and traditional pop singer, known for her deep contralto. On 16 October 2018 Prikhodko anounced on Facebook that she had decided to end her musical career. At the end of October 2018 Prikhodko anounced she was pursuing a national political career.\n\nAs a singer Prikhodko won the Russian \"Star Factory\" contest in 2007 and represented Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest on May 16, 2009 in Moscow, where she finished 11th. In 2014, she vowed never to perform in Russia again because she accused the country of occupying parts of Ukraine.\n\nAnastasia Prikhodko was born in Kiev, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to Oksana Prikhodko and Konstantin Rybalov, a Russian miner from Rostov-on-Don. Her parents are divorced. She has an elder brother, Nazar Prikhodko Her mother is a theater critic and works for the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine. Her great-grandfather was ethnic Japanese.\n\nPrikhodko graduated from the Kiev National University of Culture and Arts, majoring in folk vocal.\n\nPrikhodko won the seventh edition of the Russian television singing talent contest Star Factory. During the show, Prikhodko was filmed telling another contestant that she did not like Chinese people and blacks. She apologized about this shortly after the incident.\n\nPrikhodko entered the Ukrainian national selection for the 2009 Eurovision in the semi-final. She was disqualified for performing her own composition, \"Vsë za tebya\" (\"Все за тебя\"), from her repertoire for the \"Star Factory\" TV show. The National Jury saw it as a violation of Paragraph 4.3 of the Rules of Eurovision Song Competition issued by the National Television Company of Ukraine on October 31, 2008 prohibiting performance in the semi-final of anything but the Eurovision entry. In explicit words, the paragraph said: \"On 8 February 2009 on the improvised stage set in the NTVU studios, the 30 semi-finalists perform their competition songs live.\" Prikhodko's interpretation of the rules was that as her Eurovision entry song \"Mamo\" had been submitted already in the first round of the competition, the rules did not require her to perform the song before the final. In Prikhodko's understanding, the semi final had been just a showcase of the contestant's vocal talents. She and her manager Olena Mozhova (ex-wife of Oleksandr Ponomaryov, one of the members of the jury) claimed that neither the broadcaster NTU nor the members of the jury had used trustworthy methods to select the contestants. The duo sent a letter to the President of Ukraine where Prikhodko stated: \"as a citizen of Ukraine, native Kievan, patriot of the country, I was deeply staggered by the impertinent actions and unethical comments of representatives of NTU, and also members of the so-called 'objective, impartial and independent' judges of the competition... I only ask for an honest chance to come forward before an All-Ukrainian audience in the finale of the National selection\". The letter was co-signed by Konstantin Meladze and fellow Ukrainian artists Sofia Rotaru, Mykola Mozhovyy and Tina Karol. The Ukrainian national final, held on March 8, 2009, was temporarily suspended by a court based in Kiev due to Prikhodko's protests. Prikhodko claims, the court ruled in favour of her. By that time, she had already applied for participation in the Russian national selection, calling it \"fate\".\nPrikhodko entered the final round of the Russian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 on March 7, winning with \"Mamo\" (\"Mum\") which was both the viewers' and experts' choice at the Russian national preselection on March 7, 2009. Prikhodko sang her entry in both Russian and Ukrainian. \"I'm convinced, when representing one's country, one should sing in the native language,\" she said:\"Russian preselection committee has agreed to my principal condition – to perform \"Mamo\" in the final of Russian preselection in both Ukrainian and Russian languages\". After the final, Iosif Prigozhin the producer of the losing finalist Valeriya stated: \"A song performed in Ukrainian can’t have anything to do with Russia\". Valeriya herself sang in English. Prikhodko's win of the Russian national selection for the 2009 Eurovision sparked allegations of vote-rigging.\n\nPrikhodko became the second non-Russian singer (the first being Natalia Podolskaya) to represent Russia at the Eurovision Song Contest. Against the usual Eurovision canons, the final performance did not include choreography but concentrated on Prikhodko's vocal skills and emotions. The giant floating screens at the background featured a video of her face aging from a twenty-year-old to a seventy-year-old. She finished in 11th place with 91 points.\n\nProducer Konstantin Meladze ended his collaboration with Prikhodko in 2010 and her new partnership with producer Igor Goncharenko ended in May of the same year. Since then her brother Nazar has been her writing partner.\n\nIn August 2010, Prikhodko participated in the casting for the Ukrainian representative at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 to be held in Germany. On November 21, she qualified for the final with her song \"Action\", a minimalist English-language techno number. Although she was one of the favourites for the national final in February 2011, she placed eighth.\n\nPrikhodko switched to a Ukrainian repertoire in 2015. She claimed that this cost her popularity because at the time Ukrainian chart succes was achieved with \"funny, cheerful, with inflammatory music or Russian.\"\n\nIn 2016, Prikhodko attempted to qualify for the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest. She failed to qualify from the semi-final, finished seventh out of nine contestants.\n\nOn 16 October 2018 Prikhodko anounced on Facebook that she had decided to end her musical career.\n\nIn the April monthly Russian Airplay Chart, \"Mamo\" placed 78th with 13,716 airings. In Kiev April monthly chart, \"Mamo\" was 24th. In May 2009, Prikhodko's \"Mamo\" peaked at the 12th position of the Ukrainian Airplay Chart, 22nd of the Russian Airplay Chart, 22nd of the Finnish Download Chart, and 22nd of the Latvian Airplay Top.\n\nPrikhodko has an unusually deep contralto vocal range. Combining this with her folk vocal training, her repertoire comprises atypical songs in a minor key with a touch of folk style, performed in Ukrainian and Russian. Prikhodko composes some of her songs herself. She plays the flute, the guitar and the pianoforte, with the latter as her favourite instrument. Prikhodko pays great attention to criticism, and always tries to improve herself accordingly.\n\nPrikhodko joined the Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko in the summer of 2015. In September 2015 she stated that she had no ambition to enter the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nOn 29 October 2018 Prikhodko anounced on Facebook that she had decided to join \"Fatherland\" and she wanted to become a become a member of parliament for this party.\n\nThe official site of the Eurovision Song Contest said Prikhodko enjoyed chess, horse riding, and fashion. In a letter to the President of Ukraine, she described herself as a \"patriot of the country\" and at a February 18, 2009 press conference \"a true Ukrainian singer\". In a later interview, she stated there was a: \"...spiritual and historical affinity between Russia and Ukraine. It would be a sin to forget about one or the other.\"\n\nPrikhodko gave birth to her daughter, Nana, on Easter Sunday April 4, 2010. And a son called Olexandr on 15 August 2015.\n\nDuring Euromaidan, Prikhodko performed on Maidan Nezalezhnosti, where she expressed her support for the European integration of Ukraine. She spoke out for a united Ukraine during the 2014 Crimean crisis and the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine. In July 2014 Prikhodko joined a small tour that supported the Ukrainian army in the War in Donbass. During this tour on Twitter she stated to Russians \"You guys are stupid. You are narrow-minded and deaf! You are like puppets.\" Later in August 2014 she vowed never to perform in Russia again, accusing the country of occupying parts of Ukraine and describing singing for \"occupiers\" as \"the highest betrayal.\" On August 31, 2014 the Russian television channel NTV aired a show titled \"17 Friends of the Junta\" which targeted Prikhodko and other critics of Russia's actions in Ukraine. She responded, \"The very name of the program is laughable.\" In September 2015 Prikhodko admitted that because of her boycott of Russia her earnings have greatly reduced because half of her concerts used to take place in Russia.\n\n\n"}

From 23 April 1964 to 22 April 1976 he was a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council for the Liberal Party. Packer was originally intended to be his father's heir before a falling-out in 1972 resulted in Kerry inheriting the family business in 1974 upon Frank's death.\n\nAmong his many business activities, Packer founded the independent Spin Records label, which released many successful singles and albums from 1966 to 1972, including The Bee Gees' \"Spicks and Specks\" (1966) and the original Australian cast recording of the rock musical \"Hair\" (1969). In 1976 Packer relocated to the United States, initially living in Los Angeles before moving to Santa Barbara. Robert Clyde Packer died of heart and lung failure on 8 April 2001, aged 65.\n\nClyde Packer was born Robert Clyde Packer on 22 July 1935. He was named for his paternal grandfather, Robert Clyde Packer (1879–1934), who had established the Packer media dynasty. Clyde's father was Sir Frank Packer (1906–1974), a media proprietor who controlled Australian Consolidated Press and the Nine Network. His mother, Gretel Joyce née Bullmore (1907–1960), was the daughter of Herbert Bullmore (1874–1937), an Australian-born physician and rugby union player who represented Scotland. His younger brother was Kerry Packer (17 December 193726 December 2005).\n\nDuring their early childhood Clyde and Kerry were cared for by a nurse, Inez McCracken, whom Clyde described as a \"surrogate mother\" who made \"an unbearable childhood tolerable\". Packer was a boarder at Cranbrook School in Sydney and then Geelong Grammar in Victoria. He took part in various sports at school, including boxing, cricket, and rugby.\n\nIn the early 1950s, instead of attending university as he wished, Clyde Packer heeded his father's directive \"You go to work for me ... You'll learn far more in the school of hard knocks\". He joined Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) as a journalist and sub-editor of its flagship, \"The Daily Telegraph\". For six months he worked at the \"Daily Mail\" in London. In 1954 ACP launched a magazine, \"Weekend\", with Donald Horne as editor and Packer on staff. By 1956 Packer was a director at ACP, Frank purchased the rights to Sydney TV station TCN-9 – the first Australian station to begin regular broadcasting. By 1957 \"Weekend\" employed Lillian Roxon as a journalist and later a sub-editor. When Queensland authorities wanted to ban the magazine Packer and Horne successfully fought the injunction in court.\n\nACP followed, in February 1958, with the launch of \"The Observer\", an \"intellectual magazine\" where Horne was editor and Packer was his boss. Packer allowed Horne to hire various contributors including Bruce Beresford, Peter Coleman, Robert Hughes, Barry Humphries, and James McAuley. Packer was later the talent manager for Humphries. In 1958 Packer had hired Francis James of Anglican Press to print \"The Observer\" but after three years and a run of \"broken deadlines, overcharges, misprints, [and] slow deliveries\" Horne and Packer had taken that job away.\n\nIn 1960 ACP were involved in a commercial rivalry with Rupert Murdoch's News Limited, over interests in print media in Sydney. ACP had made an offer to buy Anglican Press when it was placed in receivership so that they could publish suburban newspapers in opposition to Murdoch's recent acquisitions. In June 1960 the rivalry between the two groups turned into a physical brawl where men hired by Murdoch fought with Packer, Kerry and their associates over the control of Anglican Press building. The Murdoch group had a photographer take evidence of the fracas and their afternoon newspaper, \"The Daily Mirror\", ran a front page article headlined \"Knight's Sons in City Brawl\" with a photo of Packer ejecting the manager of Anglican Press, John Willis, into the street. Also that year Frank bought majority interests in Melbourne TV station GTV-9 which was combined with TCN-9 to form Australia's first national network, Nine Network.\n\nIn 1961 Packer was promoted to assistant general manager of ACP. During that year two ACP publications \"Weekend\" and \"The Australian Woman's Mirror\" were merged to form \"Everybody's\" with Horne editing and Packer as its manager. In 1965 Packer was made general manager of ACP and founded a record label also called Everybody's as a joint venture with Harry M. Miller (New Zealand-born promoter) and Nat Kipner (record producer and former co-owner of Sunshine Records). However Sydney radio stations were reluctant to play singles issued by that label due to the promotion of ACP's magazine. In January the following year the label was re-launched as Spin Records with Kipner as house producer. During that year Spin Records signed The Bee Gees and issued their hit single, \"Spicks and Specks\", which reached No. 4 on the \"Go-Set\" National Top 40.\n\nDuring the late-1960s Packer took on more of the administration of Network Nine while Spin Records continued to release singles and albums by various Australian artists. In June 1969 Miller produced the Australian stage version of \"Hair\", a rock musical. Spin Records issued the soundtrack, \"Hair – Australian Cast Soundtrack\", by the end of the year, which was banned in Queensland and New Zealand.\n\nIn 1970 Clyde Packer became joint managing director of Nine Network with his father, Frank. Clyde later recalled: \"[I]t was a very equitable arrangement ... I had the responsibility and he had the authority\". Late in the next year Clyde Packer launched \"A Current Affair\" on the Nine network, with Mike Willesee hosting. In 1972, Willesee organised for \"A Current Affair\" to have an on-air interview with then-union leader, Bob Hawke, during an industrial dispute. When Frank heard of the arrangement he vetoed the decision to allow Hawke on his network, undermining Clyde's authority. Willesee later declared: \"You can't run a current affairs program, as you couldn't run a serious newspaper, and have people tell you you can't have the leader of the Trade Union movement\". Packer resigned his posts at the Nine Network and ACP, and later reflected on the split: \"I suspect my father was as glad to get rid of me as I was to get rid of him\".\n\nTheir public falling-out followed years of tight control by Frank. According to Paul Barry, \"Clyde Packer ... was also frequently dressed down and abused in public by his father, Sir Frank. Into his late thirties, Clyde was still treated like a stupid, disobedient little boy, until he could take no more and rebelled against such tyranny, splitting clearly and completely with his father\". On his father's death in May 1974, the family estate, valued at A$100 million passed directly to Kerry. In 1976, Clyde sold his quarter-share of the family business for A$4 million to Kerry, who went on to become Australia's richest man.\n\nClyde Packer had joined the Liberal Party in 1954. He became Vice-President of the Paddington-Waverley branch and a member of the Bligh state electorate conference. On 21 November 1963 he was elected as a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, with his appointment starting on 23 April 1964 and ending on 22 April 1976. Frank had a meeting with then-Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, they discussed a possible diplomatic appointment for Frank which Menzies declined. Menzies helped Packer draft his maiden speech to the parliament.\n\nPacker was the Honorary Treasurer of the Children's Surgical Research Fund, a member of New South Wales Society for Crippled Children and New South Wales Committee Council for Civil Liberties. Although a conservative politician, Packer supported freedom of speech, he voted against a bill to ban pornography. During early 1974 he worked with New South Wales Premier, Robert Askin, to develop a series of ads run by John Singleton's agency against the incumbent Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, and his Australian Labor Party in the lead up to the federal election in May.\n\nAfter Clyde Packer's resignation from the family's media interests in 1972, he became briefly involved in the counter-culture – famously donning a kaftan, claiming that it was \"better than dieting\". In the next year Packer established an adult sex magazine, \"Forum\", with Bettina Arndt as consulting editor, and later editor and then publisher. In March that year he explained his motivation for launching the new magazine in the context of changes in the role of sexuality.\n\nHe moved to California in 1976 and thereafter rarely returned to Australia. In America, he pursued interests in film, surf culture, and magazine publishing. He bought \"Surfing Magazine\" in 1976 and during the mid-1980s he expanded his interests establishing the sister magazines, \"Bodyboarding Magazine\" and \"Volleyball\". In 1984 Packer released a book, \"No Return Ticket\", where he interviewed nine fellow Australian expatriates: Robert Hughes, Gordon Chater, Graham Fraser, Dame Judith Anderson, James Wolfensohn, Germaine Greer, Maxwell Newton, Zoe Caldwell, and Sumner Locke Elliott. According to \"The Canberra Times\" Mark Thomas the book is a \"quirky, frothy anachronism\" where the interviewees \"whinge about the Australian cultural cringe in terms which no young Australian would find comprehensible\".\n\nAlso during 1984 the Costigan Commission issued a draft report into its investigation into the Painters and Dockers Union which implicated a prominent businessman codenamed \"Goanna\" in tax evasion and organised crime activities. In September that year news reports published leaked case summaries and Kerry outed himself as \"Goanna\" but denied all allegations. When Packer was contacted he observed that his brother \"had his rights trampled on and his name defamed\". The Costigan Commission had also contacted the FBI and DEA to investigate Packer's own activities after a US surfing official claimed that one of Packer's local magazines was a front for drug-trafficking. Packer was never officially accused of any wrongdoing related to these investigations.\n\nIn January 1987 Packer told Ali Cromie from \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" that he had left Australia because he \"would have a better future in America than Australia\". Initially Packer had made documentaries but most of his subsequent work was in publishing.\nHe also ran a consultancy business, Magazine Investment and Management. Cromie described his relationship with Kerry \"they got on well without being especially close. He disputes reports that portray their relationship in any other way. 'I had animosity with my father – never with my brother'\".\n\nOn 25 May 1961 Clyde Packer married Angela May Money (born 9 March 1938). Angela was the elder daughter of Dr. Rex Money, a Macquarie Street specialist and neurosurgeon, and Dorothy \"Noppy\" née Wilkinson. The couple were married at All Saints Church, Woollahra with Kerry as best man and David Halliday as groomsman. Clyde and Angela had a son, Francis Clyde Packer. In 1972 Packer and Angela divorced.\n\nPacker had relocated to Los Angeles by 1976 where he married his second wife, Kate Clifford, a former model from Brisbane, on 7 July 1977. By 1987 Clyde and Kate were living in the Santa Barbara suburb of Montecito. Clyde developed heart and kidney problems. He was on a dialysis machine for treatment and had a kidney donated from his architect. From 1999 he had been bedridden for two years. (Kerry also had heart and kidney problems and obtained a new kidney from his helicopter pilot.) Robert Clyde Packer died on 8 April 2001, aged 65. He died of heart and lung failure. A memorial for Packer was held in Sydney on 16 May 2001 with a eulogy \"Dear Clyde\" which was written by Barry Humphries and read by Packer's son, Francis. Other speakers at the memorial were John Laws, Harry M. Miller and Peter Coleman.\n\nIn the TV mini-series, \"\" (September 2013), Clyde Packer was portrayed by Alexander England.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the 1978 National League MVP and a two-time batting champion. Parker was the first professional athlete to earn an average of one million dollars per year, having signed a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker's career achievements include 2712 hits, 339 home runs, 1493 runs batted in and a lifetime batting average of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career, with a powerful arm, winning three consecutive Gold Gloves during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977.\n\nHe was a baseball All-Star in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1985, 1986, and 1990. In the 1979 All-Star Game, Parker showcased his defensive ability and powerful arm by throwing out Jim Rice at third base and Angels catcher Brian Downing at home. Parker also contributed an RBI on a sacrifice fly and was named the game's MVP.\n\nParker grew up in Cincinnati near Crosley Field, where he learned to play baseball on the stadium's parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk in a foundry. Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School. He has said his favorite sport was football, and he starred at tailback but injured a knee in a game during his senior year and gave up the game. Also a baseball star, one of his fondest memories is playing at Western Hills High School (alma mater of Pete Rose), where he hit a home run that landed on the roof of a Frisch's restaurant.\n\nIn the early 1970s, as a member of the Pirates AAA minor league ball team Charleston (WV) Charlies, Parker hit a home run that landed on a coal car on a passing train and the ball was later picked up in Columbus, Ohio. He began his major league career on July 12, 1973 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, for whom he played from 1973 to 1983.\n\nAt the 1977 MLB All-Star Game he became the only player in history to have worn batting helmets from two different teams—neither of them his own—in the same game, wearing a San Diego Padres helmet early on before swapping it out for a Cincinnati Reds one.\n\nIn 1977, he was National League batting champion, a feat he repeated in 1978 when he was named the National League's MVP. This was in spite of a collision at home plate with John Stearns during a game against the Mets on June 30, 1978, in which Parker fractured his jaw and cheekbone; he wore a specially constructed facemask in order to minimize his time away from the lineup. The Pirates rewarded him with baseball's first million-dollar-per-year contract. The following year, he was an instrumental part of the Pirates' World Series championship team.\n\nDuring a game in 1979, a powerful hit he made to right field was very difficult to throw into the infield, because he had \"knocked the cover off the ball.\" One of the seams on the ball ruptured, making nearly half of the cover come loose.\n\nPittsburgh fans angered by his million-dollar contract threw \"nuts and bolts and bullets and batteries\" at him, as pitcher Kent Tekulve stated; a typo in a news story made it appear that they threw car batteries.\n\nIn 1981, at a point in his career when it looked as if he would one day rank among the game's all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book \"The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time\". The authors, noting that Parker had succeeded Roberto Clemente at the position, wrote, \"Someone must have a fondness for right field in Pittsburgh.\"\n\nParker took after his Pirates teammate Willie Stargell in warming up in the on-deck circle with a sledgehammer (when most batters would use a simple lead-weighted bat).\n\nIn the early 1980s, however, Parker's hitting suffered due to injuries, weight problems, and his increasing cocaine use. He became one of the central figures in a drug scandal that spread through the major leagues.\n\nAt the end of the 1983 season, Parker became a free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. In Cincinnati, his hometown, he returned to the form that made him an All-Star in Pittsburgh. In 1985, he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a .312 batting average, 34 home runs, and 125 RBI. Parker finished second in 1985 MVP voting to Willie McGee.\n\nFollowing the season, Parker was among several players who testified against a dealer in the Pittsburgh drug trials. Named as \"regular users\", Parker and six other players were suspended for the following season. The sentences were commuted, however, in exchange for donating ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, submitting to random drug testing, and contributing 100 hours of drug-related community service.\n\nAfter the 1987 season, Cincinnati traded Parker to the Oakland Athletics for José Rijo and Tim Birtsas. In Oakland, Parker was able to extend his career by spending most of his time as a designated hitter. Although injuries and age caught up to him to a degree – he hit just .257 with 12 homers in 377 at-bats in 1988 and .264 with 22 homers in 553 at-bats in 1989 – his veteran leadership was a significant factor in the A's consecutive World Series appearances.\n\nParker signed with the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1990 season and had a solid year as the Brewers' DH with a .289 average and 21 home runs in 610 at-bats. Milwaukee opted for youth, however, at the end of the year and traded the aging Parker to the Angels for Dante Bichette.\n\nParker's last season was 1991. He played for the California Angels until late in the season when he was released. The Toronto Blue Jays then signed him as insurance for the pennant race, and Parker hit .333 in limited action. Since he was acquired too late in the season, however, he did not qualify for inclusion on the post-season roster and thus was unable to play in the American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins, which the Blue Jays lost in five games. Parker retired at the end of the season.\n\nParker has served as a first-base coach for the Anaheim Angels, a batting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998, and a special hitting instructor for Pittsburgh. He owned several Popeye's Chicken franchises in Cincinnati until selling his interest in them in 2012 after 25 years.\n\nParker never got more than 24% of votes on Hall of Fame ballots, and his 15-year Baseball Writers' Association of America eligibility was exhausted on the 2011 ballot. He can now be considered for the Veterans Committee Expansion from 2014. Along with Keith Hernandez and (until 2017) Tim Raines, Parker's involvement with the Pittsburgh drug trials has been the most likely cause of his not being voted into the Hall of Fame, serving as a precursor to those listed on the Mitchell Report not being voted into the Hall of Fame due to steroid abuse.\n\nParker has had both of his knees replaced due to injuries from his playing career. In 2013, he confirmed to the \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\" that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He is involved in raising money to find a cure for Parkinson's disease through the Dave Parker 39 Foundation.\n\nParker has six children. He currently resides in Loveland, Ohio, near Cincinnati, with his wife, Kellye.\n\nParker was elected to the Reds Hall of Fame Class of 2014, which also included fellow Cincinnati natives Ron Oester and Ken Griffey Jr. In 2012, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Public Schools Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\n, or Retrosheet, or Lesters Legends, or Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Winter League)\n"}

LeBlanc is the son of former Member of Parliament, Senator and Governor General of Canada, Roméo LeBlanc.\n\nLeBlanc ran for leadership of Liberal Party in 2008 but dropped out of the race to endorse Michael Ignatieff, who was later acclaimed leader. With the resignation of Ignatieff after the 2011 federal election LeBlanc was considered a likely candidate in the race to succeed him as party leader, but declined on running.\n\nOn November 4, 2015, he was appointed the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons in the present Cabinet, headed by Justin Trudeau. On May 31, 2016, upon the resignation of Hunter Tootoo from the Ministry, LeBlanc also assumed the role of Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard. On August 19, 2016, LeBlanc was replaced by Bardish Chagger as Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. On July 18, 2018, LeBlanc was shuffled from the role of Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard to the role of Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Northern Affairs and Internal Trade.\n\nLeBlanc was born in Ottawa, Ontario, to Roméo LeBlanc and Joslyn \"Lyn\" Carter. As a child, he baby-sat Justin, Alexandre, and Michel Trudeau, the children of then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He has remained friends with Justin Trudeau, with whom he is currently serving with in the House of Commons, and endorsed his candidacy for Liberal leader in 2012.\n\nLeBlanc attended Lisgar Collegiate Institute for high school. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Toronto (Trinity College), a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of New Brunswick, and then attended Harvard Law School, where he obtained his Master of Laws degree.\n\nPrior to being elected to the House of Commons, LeBlanc was a Barrister and Solicitor with Clark Drummie in Shediac and Moncton. From 1993-1996, LeBlanc was a Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. He is the son of the former Governor General of Canada, The Right Honourable Roméo LeBlanc, who had previously been the Member of Parliament for Westmorland-Kent from 1972 to 1984, and then a Senator from 1984 to 1994.\n\nLeBlanc is an Acadian.\n\nLeBlanc is member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Beauséjour in New Brunswick.\n\nLeBlanc first ran in that riding in 1997, losing to New Democratic Party candidate, Angela Vautour. During that race there were accusations of political patronage as LeBlanc's father was the sitting viceroy, and there was criticism that the Governor General had a series of events planned in New Brunswick the very week that the Prime Minister dropped the election writs.\n\nIn 2000 LeBlanc once again ran against Vautour, who had crossed the floor and was a Progressive Conservative, and was elected. LeBlanc has been re-elected in the 2004 (where he faced Vautour for the third time), 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2015 federal elections.\n\nDuring the Liberal Party's time in power LeBlanc served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, from January 13, 2003, to December 11, 2003, and was the chair of the Atlantic Caucus.\n\nOn July 10, 2004, he was sworn-in as a Member of the Privy Council for Canada and appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Deputy Chief Government Whip.

In January 2009, he was named by the Honourable Michael Ignatieff as the critic for justice and attorney general. Before the return of Parliament in September 2010, Ignatieff shuffled his Shadow Cabinet and appointed LeBlanc as the Liberal critic for national defence. Following LeBlanc's re-election in the 2011 federal election, interim Liberal leader Bob Rae appointed LeBlanc as the Liberal Party's Foreign Affairs Critic.\n\nOn October 27, 2008, LeBlanc was the first candidate to officially announce his intention to seek the leadership of the Liberal party to replace Stéphane Dion. Former leadership candidates Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae came forward shortly after LeBlanc's announcement.\nHis supporters included top staffers in the prime minister's office under Jean Chrétien, such as his former chief of staff Percy Downe, and Tim Murphy, chief of staff under Paul Martin. Some senior organizers in Gerard Kennedy's 2006 leadership bid were also with LeBlanc.\n\nOn December 8, 2008, LeBlanc announced he was dropping out of the leadership race because he felt a leader needed to be put in place as soon as possible and that he was throwing his support behind Ignatieff. The next day Rae dropped out of the race and Ignatieff was acclaimed leader when Dion stepped down.\n\nLeBlanc retained his seat in the 2011 election, while the Liberals dropped down to third place in the House of Commons.\n\nRegarding the race for the leadership of the Liberal Party, LeBlanc, a prospective leadership candidate, puts it, the next leader needs to commit 10 to 15 years of his or her life \"occupied exclusively\" with rebuilding the Liberal party and winning elections.\n\nOn November 4, 2015, he was appointed the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons in the present Cabinet, headed by Justin Trudeau.

The group is openly tolerated and endorsed by various leading international bishops, including the former Apostolic Papal Nuncio to the Philippines, Archbishop Antonio Franco, Cardinal Jaime Lachica Sin, and Cardinal Francis Eugene George.\n\nPreviously in 1984, Emma de Guzman was an impoverished domestic helper in Singapore, and later sought to find work in an overseas nanny housekeeping job in Toronto, Ontario. She is also the mother of three children to whom she worked to financially support them. Emma attributes her first mystical encounter with a whirlwind at a church, where a leaf landed on her foot which bore a piece of paper enlisting a potential job for her in Ontario, Canada.\n\nIn Canada, her best friend, Sol Gaviola, had organized a pilgrimage to the Fatima Shrine in Youngstown, New York, in 1991, and took her along. Emma mentioned that the Virgin Mary taught her how to pray the Holy Rosary, and requested her numerous times to pray them over, and over again through the course of three successive nights. In addition, she claims that the Virgin Mary emphatically immersed Emma's emotions through the various mysteries of the Rosary as if she were actually living each decade.\n\nEmma claims to have met Jesus Christ on two separate occasions. The first occasion was in the old chapel of Our Lady of Fatima in Youngstown, New York, under the guise of an old man. The second occasion was during a trance, to which she claims that Jesus directed her to a copy of the New Testament of the Bible. Many of Emma's followers during her Wednesday group meetings attested to the fragrances and oils which anonymously oozed out of religious statues in the home.\n\nIn 2009, a letter was circulated by unknown parties, claiming the Virgin Mary predicted the results of the upcoming presidential election.\n\nAccording to de Guzman, the Blessed Virgin Mary wears a full white tunic and has a yellow golden sash and a golden-bordered veil surrounded by light. A statue specific to Guzman's description was made for Marian veneration.\n\nAccording to Emma de Guzman, the Blessed Virgin Mary has only chosen to appear to her annually on two specific dates, the Nativity of Mary (September 8) and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (December 8) which also coincides with Emma's birthday. An exception occurred in December 2009, when Emma refused to broadcast the message she had allegedly received to the public. She also notes that the Virgin Mary does not arrive immediately, but is first introduced by singing angels.\n\nMembers of the La Pieta Group asked the Archbishop of Batangas Ramon Arguelles permission to pray at the mountains, and requested a Holy Mass, both of which were authorized by the Archbishop. The mountainous site of the apparition was later referred \"The Mountain of Salvation\" by de Guzman. Two locations were chosen by de Guzman, Cebu and Batangas, which were land donations from her benefactors. The group also has non-Filipino members, especially among American, Canadian, Polish, and Dutch devotees who travel to the shrine to witness the alleged Marian apparition.\n\nAccording to an Action News 3 New York documentary on Emma's claims of apparition, belief in golden glitters during apparitions date back to 1917, and are commonly referred to as \"Escarchas\". After obtaining samples of Emma's collected gold dust and compared them to common glitter found in holy cards, electron analysis showed no difference between the two materials yet Emma's golden dust remained the same when exposed to high contents of Hydrochloric acid. Followers of Emma maintains that the glitters appear mysteriously on her face during trances, as recorded in various video recordings. Furthermore, the golden dust collectively amounts on its own, saved on a white sheet where de Guzman sits during her apparition.\n\nOn November 4, 1995, during one of Emma's trances to which she allegedly claims to experience the Passion of Jesus Christ, Emma drew out five small, thornless, rose buds out of her chest, filled with blood and bodily mucus. Later accounts of the videotaped event claims a hole on her chest, which later closed.\n\nFollowers of Emma also attest to her various letters written in Ancient Greek, containing scriptural passages of the Gospel of Saint John, written under trance. In 2006, Witnesses claim that while Emma was being dictated to write on paper, her eyeline sight was elevated into the ceiling not looking into the writing pad, yet still continued to write a foreign language, in perfect straight lining on paper. Emma claims the writings were given by Saint John the Evangelist, and that she has no previous education in Ancient Greek or any other language, as well as doctrinal or theological knowledge of anything she has written down. At the time of the event, Emma did not have full proficiency in the English language.\n\nA Catholic priest, Father Renato Lopez, reviewed the actual physical letter and ruled that the language in which Emma wrote down was not Classical Greek but Koine Greek, remaining faithful to the timeline in which the Gospel of Saint John could possibly have been originally recorded.\n\nFurthermore, the content of the Gospel of Saint John written down by Emma in Koine Greek refers to the first letter of Saint John, chapter 4:1 which pertains to a warning not to quickly believe any spirit or seer which claims to be from God but rather seek true discernment through prayer.\n\nIn September 2012, the Feast of the Nativity of Mary, Emma stated that the Blessed Virgin Mary revealed her maternal role as \"Mediatrix before the Mediator\", a special Marian title associated by many Filipino Catholics as in reference to Our Lady Mediatrix of All Graces.\n\nVideo recordings of Emma's partial stigmata manifesting include: forehead wounds, back scourging, palms, and foot.\n\nEmma has also claimed to have met with souls from Purgatory, brought by Saint Magdalena of Pazzi, requesting prayers for the liberation of their souls under the penalty of Seraphic fire.\n\nEmma claims to have either seen and/or conversed with Saint Bernadette Soubirous, Saint Teresa of Avila, and Saint Faustina Kowalska.\n\nEmma de Guzman, a devout Catholic, publicly opposes the passage of the Reproductive Health bill in the Philippines. On December 8, 2008, she claimed that the Blessed Virgin Mary wept and rebuked politicians and laypersons who do not respect the sanctity of life, as well as to warn that the Reproductive Health Bill as a law will bring forward the suffering and destruction of many souls. In addition, she also opposes the use of contraception and abortion among her followers.\n\nEmma de Guzman is known for receiving approbations from various notable Roman Catholic clerics, namely the former Apostolic Papal Nuncio to the Philippines, Archbishop Antonio Franco, Cardinal Jaime Lachica Sin, Cardinal Francis Eugene George, Bishop James Michael Moynihan, Monsignor John Canary, the Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Chicago.\n\nIn a circular dated November 18, 2004, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalookan, authorised by Bishop Deogracias Iñiguez granted an official Imprimatur on the La Pieta house prayer booklet, along with its religious Marian hymns.\n\nOn December 2, 2012, the statue of \"Our Mother of Love, Peace and Joy\" endorsed by de Guzman was featured in the \"Intramuros Grand Marian Procession\", a religious Catholic event sponsored by the Cofradia de la Inmaculada Concepcion and Archdiocese of Manila.\n\nVarious materials and correspondence were submitted to the Holy See in 2010 for further research and investigation. The prayer group, \"La Pieta House of Prayer\", declines to provide any information regarding its submission, contents and correspondence to the general public. The apostolate group claims full obeisance to the Roman Catholic Church and its verdict on the recorded apparitions.\n\n\n"}

George was a Syrian-born Byzantine Christian of Greek ancestry. He was born in Antioch, whence he moved with his father, Michael, and mother to Tunisia following the First Crusade. He and his parents found employment under the Zirid emir, Tamim ibn Muizz. George fell out with Tamim's son and successor, Yahya, and secretly left for Christian Sicily by stealing away in disguise aboard a Palermitan ship harbored in Mahdia. Upon arrival in the Sicilian capital, George went immediately to the palace and found service with the Norman count, Roger II.\n\nGeorge of Antioch's prior knowledge of the Zirid administration, his connections with an Armenian official in Fatimid Egypt, and knowledge of Greek and Arabic led to his rise in the Norman administration. He rose to the title of \"familiaris\" of the court and by 1123 had risen to second in command in Christodulus' navy. In these years, he also served as a frequent envoy to the Fatimid court in Cairo. In a Norman attack on Mahdia that year, George captured the fortress of ad-Dimas, located on the coast of Tunisia, but the campaign resulted in a decisive Norman defeat at the hands of the Zirid emir, al-Hasan ibn Ali. In the following five years, George overshadowed Chrisotodulus and by 1127 had replaced him in the position of emir of Palermo. In that year, both emirs were present at Montescaglioso with Count Roger, but Christodulus seems to have died soon thereafter and George succeeded him.\n\nGeorge was instrumental in fully subduing independent-minded Apulia and Calabria in the years following Roger's succession there. In 1129, George brought sixty ships to bear on besieged Bari, then rebellious under Prince Grimoald Alferanites. Surrender was forced, but Roger pardoned the prince. In 1131, Roger demanded that the citizens of Amalfi turn over the keys to the castle as well as full control over their city's defences. The Amalfitans refused and George blockaded the city and captured all Amalfitan ships, forcing the city to surrender. In 1132, George was given the title \"ammiratus ammiratorum\", which translates as \"Admiral of Admirals\" in modern English, but was understood as \"Emir of Emirs\" to his contemporaries. He was also given the Greek title \"Archon of Archons\".\n\nIn 1143, George founded the Greek Orthodox church of S. Maria dell'Ammiraglio, also known as the Martorana, in Palermo. In the church there is a contemporary mosaic depicting George, as well as a mosaic showing Roger II being crowned by Christ.\n\nIn 1146, George captured Tripoli and established Sicilian authority in North Africa on a permanent basis. He had already captured several minor coastal cities in the fifteen years prior, but Mahdia, which had been in the hands of Abul-Hasan al-Hasan ibn Ali since the failed attack of 1123, did not capitulate yet.\n\nIn 1147, Roger attacked the Byzantine Empire, which continued to contest his gains in southern Italy. George he sent from Otranto with seventy galleys to assault Corfu. According to Nicetas Choniates, the island capitulated due to the imperial tax burden and George's promises. Leaving a garrison, George sailed on to the Peloponnesus. He sacked Athens and quickly moved on to the Ionian Islands. He ravaged the coast all along Euboea and the Gulf of Corinth and penetrated as far as Thebes, where he pillaged the silk factories and carried off the Jewish silk weavers. George capped the expedition with a sack of Corinth, in which the relics of Saint Theodore were stolen, and then returned to Sicily.\n\nIn 1148, George finally conquered Mahdia. Antecedently, the governor of Gabès had revolted against his overlord, al-Hasan, and promised to deliver his city to Roger II if he was confirmed as governor. War inevitably broke out in the summer of 1148. George led a fleet against Mahdia. The sultan voluntarily went into exile, taking with him very little treasure, and Mahdia capitulated. The cities of Sfax and Soussa surrendered soon after. Tunisia (Ifriqiya) was incorporated into the Kingdom of Sicily, which reached its apogee through George's conquests, containing not only Sicily and the Mezzogiorno, but also Corfu and Tunisia.\n\nIn 1149, Corfu was retaken and George took a fleet of forty ships up the Bosphorus to the walls of Constantinople, where he tried to land. Failing this, he ravaged a few \"villae\" on the Asian coast and fired arrows at the imperial palace. He died soon after, in year 546 AH according to Ibn al-Athir, corresponding to 1151 or 1152. He was succeeded in his offices by Philip of Mahdia.\n\nGeorge was a polyglot and very cultured man. He founded the church of San Michele in Mazara del Vallo. Besides that and his eponymous church, George of Antioch left as an architectural monument the seven-arched Admiral's Bridge over the River Oreto by Palermo where, on May 27, 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi's Redshirts first fought the troops of Francis II of the Two Sicilies in the \"Risorgimento\".\n\n"}

A sturdy charger, with distinctive ears, Gringolet was known far and wide for his ability in combat, and appears in very many romances in several different languages.\n\nIsrael Gollancz in the early 20th century suggested that Gringolet was derived from the giant Wade's magic boat, Wingalet - one form of magical transport (horse) being substituted for an earlier one (boat). More generally accepted is the suggestion by the prominent Arthurian scholar Roger Sherman Loomis that the French name Gringolet derived from either the Welsh \"guin-calet\" (\"white and hardy\"), or \"keincaled\" (\"handsome and hardy\") - linked to a wider Celtic tradition of heroic white horses with red ears.\n\nHis earliest appearance is in Chrétien de Troyes' \"Erec and Enide\"; in that poem he is borrowed by Sir Kay to joust against Erec. Even Gringolet cannot prevent Kay from losing to the protagonist. In the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Gawain wins Gringolet from a Saxon warrior; a different story of the acquisition is given in Wolfram von Eschenbach's \"Parzival\", where the horse bears the mark of, and comes from the stable of, the Grail castle - part of the gradual displacement of Gawain by Percival and the story of the grail.\nIn the Middle English poem \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", Gawain sets out atop Gringolet in search of the Green Chapel. Lines 600-604 of the poem describe Gringolet's ornate appearance in being readied for the journey:\n\nGawain is always shown as attached to Gringolet, caring for his horse, and talking to it as to a beloved pet or companion. When (in one tale) Gringolet is killed beneath him in combat, Gawain is seized with battle fury, and runs mad, his strength amplified, until nightfall. \n"}

{"id": "8484604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8484604", "title": "Jack Tafari", "text": "Jack Tafari\n\nJack Tafari (born 31 October 1946 in Gravesend, Kent, United Kingdom, died 20 April 2016 in Accra, Ghana, Africa), was a sometimes homeless Rastafari activist who advocated for himself and other homeless people, in the USA and the UK. He was best known for promoting \"sanctioned tent cities\" as transitional housing for homeless people, including himself, in Portland, Oregon, United States.\n\nIn February 2000, Tafari moved from Salem, Oregon to Portland, Oregon after being fired from a job. He was homeless, and he, with others, created Dignity Village in 2000, as a 'sanctioned tent city' (self governing homeless shelter) in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIn December 2000, Tafari was sleeping rough under bridges and in doorways in Portland, Oregon, United States. There weren’t enough shelter spaces for all of Portland's homeless, and Tafari found himself sharing the streets with others. With seven others, Tafari began occupying city properties and pitching tents. \"Confronted by police for their unlicensed use of public land, the initial group of eight men and women had the benefit of a forceful voice in the person of homeless activist Jack Tafari, and the early support of a few local politicians and associated coverage in the local media. The Portland police department eventually realized that the group, then calling themselves Camp Dignity, was engaged in complicated Constitutional issues of redress of grievance, and deferred the political issue to the local political authority: The Portland City Council and Mayor\".\n\nWhile living on Portland's streets, Tafari had become the protector of a sixteen-year-old boy who went by the ‘street name’ of Field Mouse. Field Mouse had been evicted from a hostel for runaways for violating curfew. As his ‘street father’, Tafari helped him to forage for food and protected him from ‘chicken hawks’, or sexual predators. At a Portland public library, Field Mouse taught Tafari how to use computers and email.\n\nIn early confrontations with the Portland police, Tafari used his newfound technological prowess to advance his cause by combining Internet communications and traditional public relations techniques. To ‘sweep’ Camp Dignity, the police were required to serve twenty-four hours' notice. Tafari started writing press releases and distributing them by email, using the Internet facilities of the Independent Publishing Resource Center. His group put their things in shopping carts and, led by their wheelchair cases, they were ‘moved on’ by the police from place to place. John Reese was appointed as ‘Grand Marshal’, and as a result of extensive media coverage, their ‘shopping cart parades’ became internationally celebrated.\n\nThe most famous shopping cart parade, which took place on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, 2001, included 35 shopping carts and was headed up by a disabled pair in wheelchairs, Grand Marshal John Reese and \"Granma Coyote\", Jada Mae Langloss. It attracted nationwide media coverage, and the spectacle of armed policemen herding a group of the indigent made for compelling viewing.\n\nAs a consequence of the Martin Luther King Day Parade, Camp Dignity lasted for a space of about six months underneath Portland's Fremont Bridge. The Mayor and Council granted the camp the status of a city \"pilot project\" and offered them a site seven miles from Portland at the Sunderland Recycling Yard. As a negotiating tactic, Tafari distributed another press release headlined \"We're Having a Big Parade\". Faced with the prospect of another highly publicized parade of the indigent, Portland backed down, and allowed the campers two more months at the Fremont Bridge site. Calling off the planned parade, Tafari sent out another press release. After protracted negotiations, Camp Dignity accepted Portland's offered site at the Sunderland Recycling Yard.\n\nThroughout the ‘Out of the Doorways Campaign’ years, Tafari was a staff writer and submissions editor for the Portland street newspaper Street Roots, and he used this position to publicise his cause among the homeless. The following passage, from an article in the December 2000 issue, is an example of the language Tafari used in his articles to rally Portland's homeless to his cause. He said,\n\nDignity Village, a homeless camp incorporated in Portland, Oregon as a 501(c)(3) membership-based non-profit organization, is set up as a self-governing entity, and \"residents\" are bound by five rules of behaviour, contained in their membership agreement. Tafari was chairman of Dignity Village Inc. from 2002 until 2005. The community has generated considerable international interest as a possible means of ameliorating the problem of developed world homelessness. In 2004, Tafari was invited to London to address the Crisis Innovations Fair on the subject of homelessness and possible solutions. He shared the podium with Dr. Michael Woolcock, senior social scientist with the World Bank.\n\nDignity Village has been featured in articles in London's The Guardian, in The New York Times, and in other publications and media. \"The LA Times\" captured Tafari's vision for Dignity Village in a whimsical, idyllic quotation. \"Essentially, we will create housing for ourselves...The housing will be solar-powered, wind-driven. We'll eat from our garden, on our own table, and rest under our own fig trees when our labors are done.\"\n\nDignity Village, founded in 2001, today (in 2016) also serves as a widely emulated prototype for the tiny houses for the homeless movement: as an example, Opportunity Village in Eugene Oregon.\n\nIn 2005 Tafari was diagnosed with hepatitis C. As he was poor he had no US health insurance, and was therefore unable to have his condition treated. He was also however, a UK citizen. He resigned his position as CEO of Dignity Village and returned to London to receive medical treatment under the English National Health Service (NHS). Homeless at first, he took advantage of English squatting laws to secure temporary housing for himself and sometimes others. These laws, which originated in the middle ages, allowed for unoccupied buildings to be taken over as temporary housing by those in need. During this period Tafari honed his squatting skills in three areas: the ‘scouting’ of suitable squats; ‘cracking’ squats (gaining entry); and ‘legally filing’ (registering) squats, such that property owners would have to go to court to secure evictions by means of interim possession orders.\n\nIn 2007 Tafari secured housing for himself when he was awarded a council flat on a Peabody Trust estate in Islington, north London. Now a British pensioner, and with his hepatitis C in remission, he had a secure base from which to continue his activism. He therefore set out to reconfigure his housing for the homeless strategy to suit the English legal and institutional landscape. With a small network of co activists, he began scouting, cracking and legally registering squats as temporary housing for homeless people, sometimes working informally with organisations such as the Advisory Service for Squatters.\n\nOn September 1, 2012, squatting residential properties became a criminal offence in England. Tafari nevertheless continued to advocate for housing rights for homeless people, for example by forcefully opposing the sale to private developers of London's dwindling stock of council housing.\n\nIn January 2016, Tafari was diagnosed in London with inoperable liver cancer. With help from a group of friends, he achieved his bucket list wish to revisit Africa, where he had travelled in 2010 in the company of his friend Leland Larson, philanthropist, of the Oregon-based Larson Legacy. He left London in the company of another close friend, Maira Fenci, travelling first to Casablanca, and from thence to Accra, Ghana. He died on April 20 at the 37 Military Hospital in Accra of liver failure, and is buried in Akuma Village on the outskirts of Accra. His wake and burial were performed in accordance with blended Ghanaian and Rastafari funeral rites, and included crowds of guests from Accra's Rastafari community.\n\n"}

He was abducted and killed after he was freed following an inconclusive court case that ended with a hung jury mistrial.\n\nJoseph Kahahawai was born in rural Maui, 25 December 1909. His family moved to Honolulu and Kahahawai′s parents divorced. He lived with his mother, who later remarried, while Kahahawai remained in contact with his father. After elementary school, Kahahawai attended Saint Louis School through an athletic scholarship to play for the high school football team, building up a positive reputation. Due to the Great Depression, Kahahawai never graduated and worked various jobs. He also enlisted in the Territorial National Guard. As a boxer, Kahahawai fought both professionally under the name Joe Kalani and as a member of the 298th Infantry Regiment.\n\nWith a hung jury – stymied by conflicting evidence – resulting in a mistrial, Kahahawai was kidnapped by Thalia Massie's mother and husband, Grace Fortescue and Navy Lieutenant Thomas Massie respectively, and two Navy enlisted men, Albert O. Jones and Edward J. Lord. While Thomas Massie was questioning him in an attempt to force a rape confession, Kahahawai reportedly lunged at Massie, and Jones shot him.\n\nMassie, Fortescue, Jones and Lord were charged with murder. The jury found them guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter, and they were each sentenced to 10 years in prison. The white population, heavily weighted by the American citizens of Naval Station Pearl Harbor and the businesses supporting it, was enraged. Under pressure from Rear Admiral Yates Stirling, Jr., Commandant of the US Navy's 14th Naval District (including N.S. Pearl Harbor), and following threats that martial law might be imposed if the sentences were allowed to stand, Territorial Governor Lawrence M. Judd commuted the 10-year sentences of the convicted killers to one hour, to be served in his office. The four convicted killers left Hawaii just days after sitting through their one hour sentence preventing the retrial of the four surviving defendants in the Massie rape case.\n\n"}

As Mexican forces entered her hometown, San Antonio de Bexar, on February 23, Alsbury's cousin by marriage, James Bowie, brought her with him to the Alamo Mission so that he could protect her. Bowie, the co-commander of the Texian forces, collapsed from illness on the second day of the siege; Alsbury nursed him throughout the remainder of the siege. On March 4, Texian co-commander William Barret Travis sent her as an emissary to Mexican commander Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna to negotiate an honorable surrender for the Texian forces. She made no headway, and her visit likely increased Santa Anna's impatience to end the siege in a spectacular fashion. Santa Anna launched an early-morning assault on the Alamo on March 6.\n\nMost Texian troops were killed during the Battle of the Alamo. Two of them died in front of Alsbury. One Texian was killed trying to protect Alsbury, her sister Gertrudis, and her young son Alijo Perez Jr., from Mexican troops. The other was found hiding in her room. The women were rescued by a Mexican officer and interviewed by Santa Anna before being released.\n\nAlsbury belonged to a prominent family within San Antonio de Bexar and was raised by her uncle Juan Martin de Veramendi, who briefly served as governor of Texas. She married three times. Her first husband died of cholera; the second, Dr. Horace Alsbury, was captured by Mexican forces during the Mexican-American War; after his death, she married a cousin of her first husband.\n\nJuana Gertrudis Navarro was born in San Antonio de Béxar (modern San Antonio, Texas) to José Ángel Navarro and Concepción Cervantes. Her exact birthdate was unrecorded, but she was baptized on December 28, 1812. The Navarro family was well known in Béxar; both Juana's father and his brother, José Antonio Navarro, held prominent positions in local government.\n\nJuana was about 17 when her mother died on January 30, 1830. Juana's father remarried almost a year later in January 1831. She and her younger sister Gertrudis were adopted by their father's sister, Josefa Navarro, who was married to Juan Martín de Veramendi. The Navarro girls considered their cousin Ursula another sister. Veramendi served as governor of Coahuila y Tejas from 1832–1833. Although Juana spoke little English, she and her family socialized with the prominent Anglo families in Béxar, including Samuel and Mary Maverick.\n\nIn 1832, Juana married Alejo Pérez Ramigio, a relative of the De León family which had founded Victoria, Texas. Pérez was a merchant, with a license to transport goods to and from Monclova The couple had one son, Alijo Perez Jr., and may have had a daughter who died in infancy.\n\nJuana's adoptive parents and her cousin Ursula died in a cholera epidemic in Monclova in 1833. Her husband died of the same disease in either 1834 or 1835.\n\nIn the early to mid-1830s, the political situation in Mexico underwent much upheaval. Federalists wished to delegate many powers to the individual Mexican states, while centralists wished to consolidate power at the national level. In 1835, several interior Mexican states, angry at the increasingly dictatorial policies of Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna, took up arms against the Mexican government. Texians launched their own armed rebellion, known as the Texas Revolution, in October 1835. Over the next two months, Texians successfully removed all Mexican troops from the region. Their actions infuriated Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who immediately began preparations to invade Texas. Most of the Navarro family supported the Texian cause. An exception was Juana's father, who joined Santa Anna's new Army of Operations in Texas as an officer. Although he remained loyal to Mexico, José Ángel Navarro had been very vocal in his disagreement with Santa Anna's overthrow of the 1824 Constitution of Mexico.\n\nIn January 1836, Juana married again, to Dr. Horace Alsbury. The couple had known each other for some time; Alsbury had many meetings in Béxar with James Bowie, the widower of Juana's cousin Ursula. Alsbury was a Texian spy, gathering information about the Mexican army.\nRumors soon flew that Santa Anna and his army were coming directly toward Béxar, location of the Alamo Mission, one of two Texian garrisons. Many local residents fled the town. On February 23, Horace Alsbury left for East Texas, either to find a safe place to bring his wife, her son, and her sister Gertrudis, or to gather reinforcements for the undermanned Texian garrison. Alsbury left his family with Bowie, a colonel in the Texian militia.\n\nLater that afternoon, the vanguard of Santa Anna's army arrived. Bowie moved the women and children into the Alamo. The women and child were given a room in \"the northwest corner of the fort\", near the quarters of Texian commanders Bowie and William Barret Travis. By the end of the day, more than 1,500 Mexican troops had entered Bexar and initiated a siege of the Alamo.\n\nAt some point on the second day of the siege, Bowie collapsed from illness. He was confined to his bed and Juana acted as his nurse. Throughout the siege, the Mexican army kept up a continual bombardment, while the Texians were forced to conserve their ammunition and rarely respond. Conditions were difficult for the women and children in the fort. There was little food, and the constant noise made it difficult to sleep.\n\nOn March 3, an additional 1,000 Mexican soldiers arrived in Bexar. The Texians were vastly outnumbered, although between 32 and 80 additional men were able to break through Mexican lines to join them in the Alamo, bringing Texian numbers to approximately 250.\n\nThe following evening (March 4), Travis sent Juana to negotiate an honorable surrender for the Alamo defenders. Fellow survivor Susanna Dickinson misinterpreted Juana's mission and, years later, accused her of deserting the Texians to provide information about their defenses to her father, who served on Santa Anna's staff. Historians place no credence in the theory that Juana spied for the Mexican army, but acknowledge that her visit likely increased Santa Anna's impatience to end the siege. As historian Timothy Todish noted, \"there would have been little glory in a bloodless victory\". The following morning, Santa Anna announced to his staff that the assault would take place early on March 6.\n\nThe Mexican army attacked the Alamo just before 6:00 am on March 6. During the battle, Juana and her son and sister hid in one of the rooms along the west wall. Juana dressed her son as a girl \"in the hope that Mexican troops would not harm him\". As the battle approached their rooms, Gertrudis Navarro opened the door to signal that they meant no harm. When Mexican soldiers threatened them, a Texian defender charged into the room to defend them; he was quickly killed, as was a young Tejano who took refuge in the room. Soldiers rifled through Juana's trunk and confiscated most of its contents, including her clothing, coins, jewelry, and even \"the watches that Travis and other officers had given her for safekeeping.\"\n\nA Mexican officer entered the room and forbade the soldiers from harming the women and child. When the battle ended, almost all of the Texians were dead. Seven women and seven children survived. Juana and her family were escorted out of the Alamo by her former brother-in-law, Manuel Pérez, who was a soldier in Santa Anna's army. Pérez took them to the home of her father.\n\nSanta Anna personally interviewed each surviving noncombatant on March 7. He was most impressed with Dickinson, and offered to adopt her young daughter and educate the child in Mexico City. No similar offer was extended to Juana, whose son was approximately the same age. Each woman was given a blanket and two silver pesos. The survivors requested permission to find the bodies of their loved ones and give them a proper burial, but were denied by Santa Anna.\n\nJuana and her sister were in an awkward situation. Many Anglos in Béxar considered all Mexicans traitors to the Texas Revolution. Many of those in Béxar still loyal to Mexico considered Juana and her sister traitors for being in the Alamo. The Texas Revolution ended in April 1836, when the Texian army captured Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto. Juana's father died several months later, leaving each of his daughter 25 head of cattle.\n\nFollowing the war, the Alsburys moved to Calaveras Ranch, property her family had long owned along the road to Goliad. The Mexican government refused to recognize the new Republic of Texas. In September 1842, Mexican general Adrian Woll invaded Texas and captured Béxar. He arrested several dozen Texians, including Horace Alsbury, and marched them into Mexico. Juana followed as far as Candela, Coahuila. She waited there for almost two years, until Horace Alsbury was released in 1844. The couple returned to Texas. Horace Alsbury then joined troops fighting the Mexican-American War. He died while in the army in 1846 or 1847. At some point after this, Juana married again, to Juan Pérez, her first husband's cousin.\n\nIn 1857 Juana petitioned the legislature of the State of Texas for one of the pensions available to people who had served in the Texas Revolution. For her service as a nurse to Bowie, her request was granted.\n\nJuana died on July 23, 1888 at her son's home along Salado Creek in Bexar County, Texas. She was either buried there or at a Catholic cemetery within San Antonio.\n\nFor many decades, published accounts of the Battle of the Alamo listed only two survivors, Susannah Dickinson and her daughter Angelina, \"the Babe of the Alamo\".\n\nIn the late 1880s Juana was interviewed by her friend Mary Maverick and historian John S. Ford about her recollections of the Battle of the Alamo. The interview took place over 50 years after the battle, and the resulting synopsis was written in the \"romantic post-Civil War language of hyperbole that was fashionable in the 1880s\". As one of only three accounts by Texian survivors, Juana's interview is \"among the most relied upon sources about these non-combatant women and children.\" The interview was not published until 1995, when it appeared in historian Timothy Matovina's book \"The Alamo Remembered: Tejano Accounts and Perspectives\".\n\n\n"}

Mortaigne became a squire of Prince Philipp, son of Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, while he was pursuing a military education in the Netherlands. On 17 August 1626, Philipp was killed while fighting for the Protestant side at the Battle of Lutter. Following his master's death Mortaigne entered the service of Sweden, becoming colonel in 1637. The course of the Swedish intervention into the Thirty Years' War was abruptly interrupted in the aftermath of the 10 May 1641 death of Johan Banér, the commander of the Swedish expeditionary force.\n\nMortaigne became a leader of a large scale mutiny which paralyzed the Swedish army, demanding the immediate payment of their arrears. In July 1641, Mortaigne and Adam von Pfuhl were invited into Stockholm as representative of the mutineers. Mortaigne was promoted into brigadier general and received land in Pomerania, while the rest of the army was paid the sum of 486,200 thalers settling the crown's debts. During the course of 1642, Mortaigne took part in the second Battle of Breitenfeld and was later severely injured during an engagement in the vicinity of Brieg. In 1643, Mortaigne's forces ravaged through Moravia. On 12 February 1645, he was captured by an Imperial patrol outside Borna while carrying a portfolio of important documents. He was released on ransom, later commanding the Swedish center at the Battle of Jankau. In 1646, he returned to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel with the approval of Christina, Queen of Sweden, receiving the rank of general-lieutenant. He led Hesse-Kassel's troops during the Hessian War. On 10 July 1647, a cannonball crushed his left leg, gravely wounding him while he was besieging the Rheinfels Castle.\n\n"}
{"id": "16954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16954", "title": "Kickapoo people", "text": "Kickapoo people\n\nThe Kickapoo People (Kickapoo: Kiikaapoa or Kiikaapoi) are an Algonquian-speaking Native American and Indigenous Mexican tribe. \"Anishinaabeg\" say the name \"Kickapoo\" (\"Giiwigaabaw\" in the Anishinaabe language and its Kickapoo cognate \"Kiwikapawa\") means \"Stands here and there,\" which may have referred to the tribe's migratory patterns. The name can also mean \"wanderer\". This interpretation is contested and generally believed to be a folk etymology.\n\nToday there are three federally recognized Kickapoo tribes in the United States: Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas, the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, and the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas. The Oklahoma and Texas bands are politically associated with each other. The Kickapoo in Kansas came from a relocation from southern Missouri in 1832 as a land exchange from their reserve there. Around 3,000 people are enrolled tribal members. Another band, the Tribu Kikapú, resides in Múzquiz Municipality in the Mexican state of Coahuila. Smaller bands live in Sonora and Durango.\n\nThe Kickapoo were an Algonquian-language people who likely migrated to or developed as a people in a large territory along the Wabash River in the area of modern Terre Haute, Indiana. They were confederated with the larger Wabash Confederacy, which included the Piankeshaw to their south, the Wea to their north, and the powerful Miami Tribe, to their east. A subgroup occupied the Upper Iowa River region in what was later known as northeast Iowa and the Root River region in southeast Minnesota in the late 1600s and early 1700s. This group was probably known by the clan name \"Mahouea\", derived from the Illinoian word for wolf, \"m'hwea\".\n\nThe earliest European contact with the Kickapoo tribe occurred during the La Salle Expeditions into Illinois Country in the late 17th century. The French colonists set up remote fur trading posts throughout the region, including on the Wabash River. They typically would set up posts at or near Native American villages, and Terre Haute was founded as a French village. The Kickapoo had to contend with a changing cast of Europeans; the British defeated the French in the Seven Years' War and took over nominal rule of this area after 1763. They increased their own trading with the Kickapoo.\n\nThe United States acquired this territory east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River after it gained independence from the United Kingdom. As white settlers moved into the region from the United States eastern areas, beginning in the early 19th century, the Kickapoo were under pressure. They negotiated with the United States over their territory in several treaties, including the Treaty of Vincennes, the Treaty of Grouseland, and the Treaty of Fort Wayne. They sold most of their lands to the United States and moved north to settle among the Wea.\n\nRising tensions between the regional tribes and the United States led to Tecumseh's War in 1811. The Kickapoo were one of Tecumseh's closest allies. Many Kickapoo warriors participated in the Battle of Tippecanoe and the subsequent War of 1812 on the side of the British, hoping to expel the American settlers from the region. A prominent, nonviolent spiritual leader among the Kickapoo was Kennekuk, who led his followers during Indian Removal in the 1830s to their current tribal lands in Kansas. He died there in 1852.\n\nThe close of the war led to a change of federal Indian policy in the Indiana Territory, and later the state of Indiana. American leaders began to advocate the removal of tribes to lands west of the Mississippi River, to extinguish their claims to lands wanted by American settlers. The Kickapoo were among the first tribes to leave Indiana under this program. They accepted land in Kansas and an annual subsidy in exchange for leaving the state.\n\nKickapoo speak an Algonquian language closely related to that of the Sauk and Fox. They are classified with the Central Algonquians, and are also related to the Illinois Confederation.\n\nIn 1985 the Kickapoo Nation's School in Horton, Kansas began a language immersion program for elementary school grades to revive teaching and use of the Kickapoo language in grades K-6. Efforts in language education continue at most Kickapoo sites. In 2010, the Head Start Program at the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas (KTTT) reservation, which teaches the Kickapoo language, became \"the first Native American school to earn Texas School Ready! (TSR) Project certification.\"\n\nAlso in 2010, Mexico's \"Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) participated in the elaboration of a Kickapoo alphabet that may be used by more than 700 members of the group that dwell in Mexico and the United States, in the states of Coahuila and Texas. Previously no Kickapoo alphabet was used in Mexico; although there is a syllabic writing system it has no element ordination, organization or classification method.\" The Kickapoo in Mexico are known for their whistled speech.\n\nTexts, recordings, and a vocabulary of the language are available.\n\nThe Kickapoo language and members of the Kickapoo tribe were featured in the movie \"The Only Good Indian\" (2009), directed by Greg Wilmott and starring Wes Studi. This was a fictionalized account of Native American children forced to attend an Indian boarding school, where they were forced to speak English and give up their cultures.\n\nThe consonant sounds of the Kickapoo language are given below. The sounds can range to sounding voiced, but only infrequently. The eight vowel sounds in Kickapoo are as followed: short and long . Three of the vowels , have allophones .\n\nThere are three federally recognized Kickapoo communities in the United States: one in Kansas, one in Texas, and the third in Oklahoma. The Mexican Kickapoo are closely tied to the Texas and Oklahoma communities. These groups migrate annually among the three locations to maintain connections. Indeed, the Texas and Mexican branch are the same cross-border nation, called Kickapoo of Coahuila/Texas \n\nThe Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Kansas is located at in the northeastern part of the state in parts of three counties: Brown, Jackson, and Atchison. It has a land area of and a resident population of 4,419 as of the 2000 census. The largest community on the reservation is the city of Horton. The other communities are:\n\nThe Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Texas is located at on the Rio Grande on the U.S.-Mexico border in western Maverick County, just south of the city of Eagle Pass, as part of the community of Rosita South. It has a land area of and a 2000 census population of 420 persons. The Texas Indian Commission officially recognized the tribe in 1977.\n\nOther Kickapoo in Maverick County, Texas, constitute the \"South Texas Subgroup of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma\". That band owns of non-reservation land in Maverick County, primarily to the north of Eagle Pass. It has an office in that city.\n\nAfter being expelled from the Republic of Texas, many Kickapoo moved south to Mexico, but the population of two villages settled in Indian Territory. One village settled within the Chickasaw Nation and the other within the Muscogee Creek Nation. These Kickapoo were granted their own reservation in 1883 and became recognized as the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma.\n\nThe reservation was short-lived. In 1893 under the Dawes Act, their communal tribal lands were broken up and assigned to separate member households by allotments. The tribe's government was dismantled by the Curtis Act of 1898, which encouraged assimilation by Native Americans to the majority culture. Tribal members struggled under these conditions.\n\nIn the 1930s the federal and state governments encouraged tribes to reorganize their governments. This one formed the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma in 1936, under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act.\n\nToday the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma is headquartered in McLoud, Oklahoma. Their tribal jurisdictional area is in Oklahoma, Pottawatomie, and Lincoln counties. They have 2,719 enrolled tribal members.\n\n\n\n"}

The amputated right limb became a tourist attraction in the village of Waterloo in Belgium, where it had been removed and interred.\n\nHenry Paget, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge, later the 1st Marquess of Anglesey, commanded 13,000 Allied cavalry and 44 guns of the horse artillery at the Battle of Waterloo. At about 2:30 pm, at a critical stage in the battle, he led a charge of the 2,000 heavy cavalry of the Household Brigade and the Union Brigade to throw back the columns of D'Erlon's French I Corps, who were threatening to push back Picton's severely outnumbered 5th Division, with some 15,000 French infantry advancing on 3,000 British and Dutch-Belgian troops. The charge succeeded in sweeping the French infantry away in disorder, but Uxbridge was unable to rally his troops, who ran on in pursuit and were cut up by counter-attacking French cavalry. Uxbridge spent the rest of the battle leading a series of charges by British light cavalry formations, and had eight or nine horses shot from under him.\n\nOne of the last cannon shots fired on 18 June 1815 hit his right leg, necessitating its amputation above the knee. According to anecdote, which is probably apocryphal, he was close to the Duke of Wellington when his leg was hit, and exclaimed, \"By God, sir, I've lost my leg!\", to which Wellington replied \"By God, sir, so you have!\"\n\nPerhaps a more authentic version of this exchange comes from the diary of J. W. Croker, a friend of Wellington, written on 8 December\n1818, in which he recounts a conversation with Horace Seymour, the man who carried the wounded Uxbridge from the battlefield. Seymour recalled that when Uxbridge was shot he cried out, \"I have got it at last,\" to which the Duke of Wellington responded, \"No? Have you, by God?\".\n\nAfter being wounded, Lord Uxbridge was taken to his headquarters in the village of Waterloo, a house owned by M. Hyacinthe Joseph-Marie Paris, Maison Tremblant, who was still in his residence at 214, Chaussée de Bruxelles. There, the remains of his leg were removed principally by Doctor John Hume assisted by surgeons James Powell of the Ordnance Medical Department, and James Callander of the 7th Hussars, without antiseptic or anaesthetics. The Prince Regent created him Marquess of Anglesey and made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath five days after the battle.\n\nLord Uxbridge, true to his nature, remained stoical and composed. According to his aide-de-camp, Thomas Wildman, during the amputation Paget smiled and said, \"I have had a pretty long run. I have been a beau these forty-seven years, and it would not be fair to cut the young men out any longer.\" According to another anecdote his only comment through the procedure was, \"The knives appear somewhat blunt.\"\n\nAccording to the account of Sir Hussey Vivian recorded by Henry Curling in 1847:\n\nA further anecdote reports him saying \"Who would not lose a leg for such a victory?\" The saw used to amputate his leg is held by the National Army Museum. Uxbridge was offered an annual pension of £1,200 in compensation for the loss of his leg, which he refused.\n\nParis asked if he might bury the leg in his garden, later turning the place into a kind of shrine, as for a relic. Visitors were first taken to see the bloody chair upon which Uxbridge had sat during the amputation, before being escorted into the garden, where the leg had its own 'tombstone', inscribed as follows:\n\n\"Here lies the Leg of the illustrious and valiant Earl Uxbridge, Lieutenant-General of His Britannic Majesty, Commander in Chief of the English, Belgian and Dutch cavalry, wounded on the 18 June 1815 at the memorable battle of Waterloo, who, by his heroism, assisted in the triumph of the cause of mankind, gloriously decided by the resounding victory of the said day.\"\n\nSome were impressed; others less so. According to an article headed \"Marquis of Anglesey's Leg\" in \"Notes and Queries\", 1862, a wag wrote on the tombstone –\n\nGeorge Canning recorded his own impressions in verse. Some of these lines are also recorded in \"Notes and Queries\", which says they \"went the round of the papers at the time\":\n\nThe leg attracted an amazing range of tourists from European society of the very top drawer, from the King of Prussia to the Prince of Orange. It was a nice earner for Monsieur Paris and his descendants, all the way down to 1878, when it was the occasion for a minor diplomatic incident. Uxbridge's son visited, to find the bones not buried, but on open display. On investigation by the Belgian ambassador in London, it was discovered that they had been exposed in a storm which uprooted the willow tree beside which they were buried. The ambassador demanded repatriation of the relics to England but the Paris family refused, instead offering to sell the bones to the Uxbridge family, who were enraged. At this point the Belgian Minister of Justice intervened, ordering the bones to be reburied. However, the bones were not reburied; they were kept hidden. In 1934, after the last Monsieur Paris died in Brussels, his widow found them in his study, along with documentation proving their provenance. Horrified by the thought of another scandal, she incinerated them in her central heating furnace.\n\nUxbridge's close family lost several limbs in the service of the United Kingdom during the Napoleonic Wars: his brother, Major-General Sir Edward Paget, lost his right arm in the crossing of the Douro during the Second Battle of Porto in 1809, and his daughter lost a hand tending her husband on a battlefield in Spain.\n\nUxbridge used an articulated above-knee artificial leg invented by James Potts of Chelsea, with hinged knee and ankle and raising toes which became known as the Anglesey leg, after his marquessate. One of the artificial legs designed by Potts and worn by the marquess is extant, preserved at Plas Newydd in Anglesey, as is a leg of the hussar trousers worn by the 1st Marquess at Waterloo. Others are in the Household Cavalry Museum and the Musee d' Armee in Paris. The loss of his leg did not impede the Marquess of Anglesey's career. He rose to become a Field Marshal and Knight of the Garter, twice serving as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and twice as Master-General of the Ordnance.\n\nThe Belgian artist Constantinus Fidelio Coene (1780-1841) painted \"Imaginary Meeting of Sir Arthur Wellesley (1769–1852), Duke of Wellington and Sir Henry William Paget (1768–1854), 1st Marquess of Anglesey, after the Amputation of His Leg\", which shows the Marquess with his bandaged stump. This oil painting of c.1820, measuring 83 x 140.5 cm, was given by the 7th Duke of Wellington to his godson the future 8th Marquess of Anglesey, who donated it to the National Trust in 1992; it is displayed in Plas Newydd.\n\n"}

His friendship and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and three NBA championship series, are well documented.\n\nSince his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex, as well as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, broadcaster and motivational speaker. His public announcement of his HIV-positive status in 1991 helped dispel the stereotype, still widely held at the time, that HIV was a \"gay disease\" that heterosexuals need not worry about; his bravery in making this announcement was widely commended. Named by \"Ebony\" magazine as one of America's most influential black businessmen in 2009, Johnson has numerous business interests, and was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years. Johnson also is part of a group of investors that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012 and the Los Angeles Sparks in 2014.\n\nEarvin Johnson Jr. was born in Lansing, Michigan, the son of General Motors assembly worker Earvin Sr. and school janitor Christine. Johnson, who had six siblings (and three half-siblings by his father's previous marriage), was influenced by his parents' strong work ethic. His mother spent many hours after work each night cleaning their home and preparing the next day's meals, while his father did janitorial work at a used car lot and collected garbage, all while never missing a day at General Motors. Johnson would often help his father on the garbage route, and he was teased by neighborhood children who called him \"Garbage Man\".\n\nJohnson came to love basketball as a youngster. His favorite basketball player was Bill Russell, whom he admired more for his many championships than his athletic ability. He also idolized players such as Earl Monroe and Marques Haynes, and practiced \"all day\". Johnson came from an athletic family. His father played high school basketball in his home state of Mississippi, and Johnson learned the finer points about the game from him. Johnson's mother, originally from North Carolina, had also played basketball as a child, and she grew up watching her brothers play the game.\n\nBy the time he had reached the eighth grade, Johnson had begun to think about a future in basketball. He had become a dominant junior high player, once scoring 48 points in a game. Johnson looked forward to playing at Sexton High School, a school with a very successful basketball team and history that also happened to be only five blocks from his home. His plans underwent a dramatic change when he learned that he would be bused to the predominately white Everett High School instead of going to Sexton, which was predominately black. Johnson's sister Pearl and his brother Larry had bused to Everett the previous year and did not have a pleasant experience. There were incidents of racism, with rocks being thrown at buses carrying black students and white parents refusing to send their children to school. Larry was kicked off the basketball team after a confrontation during practice, prompting him to beg his brother not to play. Johnson did join the basketball team but became angry after several days when his new teammates ignored him during practice, not even passing the ball to him. He nearly got into a fight with another player before head coach George Fox intervened. Eventually, Johnson accepted his situation and the small group of black students looked to him as their leader. When recalling the events in his autobiography, \"My Life\", he talked about how his time at Everett had changed him:\n\nJohnson was first dubbed \"Magic\" as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Everett High School, when he recorded a triple-double of 36 points, 18 rebounds, and 16 assists. After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the \"Lansing State Journal\", gave him the moniker despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious. In his final high school season, Johnson led Everett to a 27–1 win–loss record while averaging 28.8 points and 16.8 rebounds per game, and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game. Johnson dedicated the championship victory to his best friend Reggie Chastine, who was killed in a car accident the previous summer. He gave Chastine much of the credit for his development as a basketball player and as a person, saying years later, \"I doubted myself back then.\" Johnson and Chastine were almost always together, playing basketball or riding around in Chastine's car. Upon learning of Chastine's death, Magic ran from his home, crying uncontrollably. Johnson, who finished his high school career with two All-State selections, was considered at the time to be the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan and was also named to the 1977 McDonald's All-American team.\n\nAlthough Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, he decided to play close to home. His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote told him he could play the point guard position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.\n\nJohnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his communication studies major and on his desire to become a television commentator. Playing with future NBA draftees Greg Kelser, Jay Vincent and Mike Brkovich, Johnson averaged 17.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game as a freshman, and led the Spartans to a 25–5 record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA Tournament. The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion Kentucky.\n\nDuring the 1978–79 season, Michigan State again qualified for the NCAA Tournament, where they advanced to the championship game and faced Indiana State, which was led by senior Larry Bird. In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever, Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75–64, and Johnson was voted Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. He was selected to the 1978–79 All-American team for his performance that season. After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7.9 assists per game, Johnson entered the 1979 NBA draft. Jud Heathcote stepped down as coach of the Spartans after the 1994–95 season, and on June 8, 1995, Johnson returned to the Breslin Center to play in the Jud Heathcote All-Star Tribute Game. He led all scorers with 39 points.\n\nJohnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers. Johnson said that what was \"most amazing\" about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the team's 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) center who became the leading scorer in NBA history. Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal. Lakers coach Jack McKinney had the rookie Johnson, who some analysts thought should play forward, be a point guard, even though incumbent Norm Nixon was already one of the best in the league. Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.\n\nThe Lakers compiled a 60–22 record in the regular season and reached the 1980 NBA Finals, in which they faced the Philadelphia 76ers, who were led by forward Julius Erving. The Lakers took a 3–2 lead in the series, but Abdul-Jabbar, who averaged 33 points a game in the series, sprained his ankle in Game 5 and could not play in Game 6. Coach Paul Westhead, who had replaced McKinney early in the season after he suffered a near-fatal bicycle accident, decided to start Johnson at center in Game 6; Johnson recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 steals in a 123–107 win, while playing guard, forward, and center at different times during the game. Johnson became the only rookie to win the NBA Finals MVP award, and his clutch performance is still regarded as one of the finest in NBA history. He also became one of four players to win NCAA and NBA championships in consecutive years.\n\nEarly in the 1980–81 season, Johnson was sidelined after he suffered torn cartilage in his left knee. He missed 45 games, and said that his rehabilitation was the \"most down\" he had ever felt. Johnson returned before the start of the 1981 playoffs, but the Lakers' then-assistant and future head coach Pat Riley later said Johnson's much-anticipated return made the Lakers a \"divided team\". The 54-win Lakers faced the 40–42 Houston Rockets in the first round of playoffs, where Houston upset the Lakers 2–1 after Johnson airballed a last-second shot in Game 3.\n\nIn 1981, after the 1980–81 season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $25-million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point. Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson had a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers \"slow\" and \"predictable\". After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner Jerry Buss fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley. Although Johnson denied responsibility for Westhead's firing, he was booed across the league, even by Laker fans. However, Buss was also unhappy with the Lakers offense and had intended on firing Westhead days before the Westhead–Johnson altercation, but assistant GM Jerry West and GM Bill Sharman had convinced Buss to delay his decision. Despite his off-court troubles, Johnson averaged 18.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and a league-high 2.7 steals per game, and was voted a member of the All-NBA Second Team. He also joined Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson as the only NBA players to tally at least 700 points, 700 rebounds, and 700 assists in the same season. The Lakers advanced through the 1982 playoffs and faced Philadelphia for the second time in three years in the 1982 NBA Finals. After a triple-double from Johnson in Game 6, the Lakers defeated the Sixers 4–2, as Johnson won his second NBA Finals MVP award. During the championship series against the Sixers, Johnson averaged 16.2 points on .533 shooting, 10.8 rebounds, 8.0 assists, and 2.5 steals per game. Johnson later said that his third season was when the Lakers first became a great team, and he credited their success to Riley.\n\nDuring the 1982–83 NBA season, Johnson averaged 16.8 points, 10.5 assists, and 8.6 rebounds per game and earned his first All-NBA First Team nomination. The Lakers again reached the Finals, and for a third time faced the Sixers, who featured center Moses Malone as well as Erving. With Johnson's teammates Nixon, James Worthy, and Bob McAdoo all hobbled by injuries, the Lakers were swept by the Sixers, and Malone was crowned the Finals MVP. In a losing effort against Philadelphia, Johnson averaged 19.0 points on .403 shooting, 12.5 assists, and 7.8 rebounds per game.\n\nPrior to Johnson's fifth season, West—who had become the Lakers general manager—traded Nixon to free Johnson from sharing the ball-handling responsibilities. Johnson that season averaged a double-double of 17.6 points and 13.1 assists, as well as 7.3 rebounds per game. The Lakers reached the Finals for the third year in a row, where Johnson's Lakers and Bird's Celtics met for the first time in the post-season. The Lakers won the first game, and led by two points in Game 2 with 18 seconds to go, but after a layup by Gerald Henderson, Johnson failed to get a shot off before the final buzzer sounded, and the Lakers lost 124–121 in overtime. In Game 3, Johnson responded with 21 assists in a 137–104 win, but in Game 4, he again made several crucial errors late in the contest. In the final minute of the game, Johnson had the ball stolen by Celtics center Robert Parish, and then missed two free throws that could have won the game. The Celtics won Game 4 in overtime, and the teams split the next two games. In the decisive Game 7 in Boston, as the Lakers trailed by three points in the final minute, opposing point guard Dennis Johnson stole the ball from Johnson, a play that effectively ended the series. Friends Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre consoled him that night, talking until the morning in his Boston hotel room amidst fan celebrations on the street. During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0 points on .560 shooting, 13.6 assists, and 7.7 rebounds per game. Johnson later described the series as \"the one championship we should have had but didn't get\".\nIn the 1984–85 regular season, Johnson averaged 18.3 points, 12.6 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per game and led the Lakers into the 1985 NBA Finals, where they faced the Celtics again. The series started poorly for the Lakers when they allowed an NBA Finals record 148 points to the Celtics in a 34-point loss in Game 1. However, Abdul-Jabbar, who was now 38 years old, scored 30 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in Game 2, and his 36 points in a Game 5 win were instrumental in establishing a 3–2 lead for Los Angeles. After the Lakers defeated the Celtics in six games, Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson, who averaged 18.3 points on .494 shooting, 14.0 assists, and 6.8 rebounds per game in the championship series, said the Finals win was the highlight of their careers.\n\nJohnson again averaged a double-double in the 1985–86 NBA season, with 18.8 points, 12.6 assists, and 5.9 rebounds per game. The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals, but were unable to defeat the Houston Rockets, who advanced to the Finals in five games. In the next season, Johnson averaged a career-high of 23.9 points, as well as 12.2 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game, and earned his first regular season MVP award. The Lakers met the Celtics for the third time in the NBA Finals, and in Game 4 Johnson hit a last-second hook shot over Celtics big men Parish and Kevin McHale to win the game 107–106. The game-winning shot, which Johnson dubbed his \"junior, junior, junior sky-hook\", helped Los Angeles defeat Boston in six games. Johnson was awarded his third Finals MVP title after averaging 26.2 points on .541 shooting, 13.0 assists, 8.0 rebounds, and 2.33 steals per game.\n\nBefore the 1987–88 NBA season, Lakers coach Pat Riley publicly promised that they would defend the NBA title, even though no team had won consecutive titles since the Celtics did so in the 1969 NBA Finals. Johnson had another productive season with averages of 19.6 points, 11.9 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per game despite missing 10 games with a groin injury. In the 1988 playoffs, the Lakers swept the San Antonio Spurs in 3 games, then survived two 4–3 series against the Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks to reach the Finals and face Thomas and the Detroit Pistons, who with players such as Bill Laimbeer, John Salley, Vinnie Johnson and Dennis Rodman were known as the \"Bad Boys\" for their physical style of play. Johnson and Thomas greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek before the opening tip of Game 1, which they called a display of brotherly love. After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP James Worthy had his first career triple-double of 36 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists, and led his team to a 108–105 win. Despite not being named MVP, Johnson had a strong championship series, averaging 21.1 points on .550 shooting, 13.0 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game. It was the fifth and final NBA championship of his career.\n\nIn the 1988–89 NBA season, Johnson's 22.5 points, 12.8 assists, and 7.9 rebounds per game earned him his second MVP award, and the Lakers reached the 1989 NBA Finals, in which they again faced the Pistons. However, after Johnson went down with a hamstring injury in Game 2, the Lakers were no match for the Pistons, who swept them 4–0.\n\nPlaying without Abdul-Jabbar for the first time, Johnson won his third MVP award after a strong 1989–90 NBA season in which he averaged 22.3 points, 11.5 assists, and 6.6 rebounds per game. However, the Lakers bowed out to the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference semifinals, which was the Lakers' earliest playoffs elimination in nine years. Mike Dunleavy became the Lakers' head coach in 1990–91, when Johnson had grown to be the league's third-oldest point guard. He had become more powerful and stronger than in his earlier years, but was also slower and less nimble. Under Dunleavy, the offense used more half-court sets, and the team had a renewed emphasis on defense. Johnson performed well during the season, with averages of 19.4 points, 12.5 assists, and 7.0 rebounds per game, and the Lakers reached the 1991 NBA Finals. There they faced the Chicago Bulls, led by shooting guard Michael Jordan, a five-time scoring champion regarded as the finest player of his era. Although the series was portrayed as a matchup between Johnson and Jordan, Bulls forward Scottie Pippen defended effectively against Johnson. Despite two triple-doubles from Johnson during the series, finals MVP Jordan led his team to a 4–1 win. In the last championship series of his career, Johnson averaged 18.6 points on .431 shooting, 12.4 assists, and 8.0 rebounds per game.\n\nAfter a physical before the 1991–92 NBA season, Johnson discovered that he had tested positive for HIV. In a press conference held on November 7, 1991, Johnson made a public announcement that he would retire immediately. He stated that his wife Cookie and their unborn child did not have HIV, and that he would dedicate his life to \"battle this deadly disease\".\n\nJohnson initially said that he did not know how he contracted the disease, but later acknowledged that it was through having numerous sexual partners during his playing career. He admitted to having \"harems of women\" and talked openly about his sexual activities because \"he was convinced that heterosexuals needed to know that they, too, were at risk\". At the time, only a small percentage of HIV-positive American men had contracted it from heterosexual sex, and it was initially rumored that Johnson was gay or bisexual, although he denied both. Johnson later accused Isiah Thomas of spreading the rumors, a claim Thomas denied. \n\nJohnson's HIV announcement became a major news story in the United States, and in 2004 was named as ESPN's seventh-most memorable moment of the previous 25 years. Many articles praised Johnson as a hero, and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush said, \"For me, Magic is a hero, a hero for anyone who loves sports.\" \n\nDespite his retirement, Johnson was voted by fans as a starter for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game at Orlando Arena, although his former teammates Byron Scott and A. C. Green said that Johnson should not play, and several NBA players, including Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, argued that they would be at risk of contamination if Johnson suffered an open wound while on court. Johnson led the West to a 153–113 win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds. The game ended after he made a last-minute three-pointer, and players from both teams ran onto the court to congratulate Johnson.\n\nJohnson was chosen to compete in the 1992 Summer Olympics for the US basketball team, dubbed the \"Dream Team\" because of the NBA stars on the roster. The Dream Team, which along with Johnson included fellow Hall of Famers such as Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and Larry Bird, was considered unbeatable. The Dream Team dominated the competition, winning the gold medal with an 8–0 record, beating their opponents by an average of 43.8 points per game. Johnson averaged 8.0 points per game during the Olympics, and his 5.5 assists per game was second on the team. Johnson played infrequently because of knee problems, but he received standing ovations from the crowd, and used the opportunity to inspire HIV-positive people.\n\nBefore the 1992–93 NBA season, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he retired again before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players. In an August 2011 interview Johnson said that in retrospect, he wished that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, \"If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have retired.\" Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA. He said that he retired because he \"didn't want to hurt the game.\"\n\nDuring his retirement, Johnson has written a book on safe sex, run several businesses, worked for NBC as a commentator, and toured Asia, Australia and New Zealand with a basketball team of former college and NBA players. In 1985, Johnson created \"A Midsummer Night's Magic\", a yearly charity event which included a celebrity basketball game and a black tie dinner. The proceeds went to the United Negro College Fund, and Johnson held this event for twenty years, ending in 2005. \"A Midsummer Night's Magic\" eventually came under the umbrella of the Magic Johnson Foundation, which he founded in 1991. The 1992 event, which was the first one held after Johnson's appearance in the 1992 Olympics, raised over $1.3 million for UNCF. Magic Johnson joined Shaquille O'Neal and celebrity coach Spike Lee to lead the blue team to a 147–132 victory over the white team, which was coached by Arsenio Hall.\n\nJohnson returned to the NBA as coach of the Lakers near the end of the 1993–94 NBA season, replacing Randy Pfund, and Bill Bertka, who served as an interim coach for two games. Johnson, who took the job at the urging of owner Jerry Buss, admitted \"I've always had the desire (to coach) in the back of my mind.\" He insisted that his health was not an issue, while downplaying questions about returning as a player, saying, \"I'm retired. Let's leave it at that.\" Amid speculation from general manager Jerry West that he may only coach until the end of the season, Johnson took over a team that had a 28–38 record, and won his first game as head coach, a 110–101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. He was coaching a team that had five of his former teammates on the roster: Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell, Tony Smith, Kurt Rambis, James Worthy, and Michael Cooper, who was brought in as an assistant coach. Johnson, who still had a guaranteed player contract that would pay him $14.6 million during the 1994–95 NBA season, signed a separate contract to coach the team that had no compensation. The Lakers played well initially, winning five of their first six games under Johnson, but after losing the next five games, Johnson announced that he was resigning as coach after the season. The Lakers finished the season on a ten-game losing streak, and Johnson's final record as a head coach was 5–11. Stating that it was never his dream to coach, he chose instead to purchase a 5% share of the team in June 1994.\n\nAt the age of 36, Johnson attempted another comeback as a player when he re-joined the Lakers during the 1995–96 NBA season. During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds. He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the Golden State Warriors. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128–118 victory. On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the Atlanta Hawks. Playing power forward, he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place with Charles Barkley in voting for the MVP Award. The Lakers had a record of 22–10 in the games Johnson played, and he considered his final comeback \"a success.\" While Johnson played well in 1996, there were struggles both on and off the court. Cedric Ceballos, upset over a reduction in his playing time after Johnson's arrival, left the team for several days. He missed two games and was stripped of his title as team captain. Nick Van Exel received a seven-game suspension for bumping referee Ron Garretson during a game on April 9. Johnson was publicly critical of Van Exel, saying his actions were \"inexcusable.\" Ironically Johnson was himself suspended five days later, when he bumped referee Scott Foster, missing three games. He also missed several games due to a calf injury. Despite these difficulties, the Lakers finished with a record of 53–29 and fourth seed in the NBA Playoffs. Although they were facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets, the Lakers had home court advantage in the five-game series. The Lakers played poorly in a Game 1 loss, prompting Johnson to express frustration with his role in coach Del Harris' offense. Johnson led the way to a Game 2 victory with 26 points, but averaged only 7.5 points per game for the remainder of the series, which the Rockets won three games to one.\n\nAfter the Lakers lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs, Johnson initially expressed a desire to return to the team for the 1996–97 NBA season, but he also talked about joining another team as a free agent, hoping to see more playing time at point guard instead of power forward. A few days later Johnson changed his mind and retired permanently, saying, \"I am going out on my terms, something I couldn't say when I aborted a comeback in 1992.\"\n\nDetermined to play competitive basketball despite being out of the NBA, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team composed of former NBA and college players. In 1994 Johnson joined with former pros Mark Aguirre, Reggie Theus, John Long, Earl Cureton, Jim Farmer, and Lester Conner, as his team played games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan. They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the CBA. In the final game of the CBA series, Magic Johnson had 30 points, 17 rebounds, and 13 assists, leading the All-Stars to a 126–121 victory over the Oklahoma City Cavalry. By the time he returned to the Lakers in 1996, the Magic Johnson All-Stars had amassed a record of 55–0, and Johnson was earning as much as $365,000 per game. Johnson played with the team frequently over the next several years, with possibly the most memorable game occurring in November, 2001. Magic, at the age of 42, played with the All-Stars against his alma mater, Michigan State. Although he played in a celebrity game to honor coach Jud Heathcoate in 1995, this was Johnson's first meaningful game played in his hometown of Lansing in 22 years. Playing in front of a sold out arena, Johnson had a triple-double and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans by two points. Johnson's half court shot at the buzzer would have won the game, but it fell short. On November 1, 2002 Johnson returned to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State. Playing with the Canberra Cannons of Australia's National Basketball League instead of his usual group of players, Johnson's team defeated the Spartans 104–85, as he scored 12 points, with 10 assists and 10 rebounds.\n\nIn 1999, Johnson joined the Swedish squad M7 Borås (now known as 'Borås Basket'), and was undefeated in five games with the team. Johnson also became a co-owner of the club; however, the project failed after one season and the club was forced into reconstruction. He later joined the Danish team The Great Danes.\n\nOn February 21, 2017, Johnson replaced Jim Buss as the president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nJohnson first fathered a son in 1981, when Andre Johnson was born to Melissa Mitchell. Although Andre was raised by his mother, he visited Johnson each summer, and later worked for Magic Johnson Enterprises as a marketing director. In 1991, Johnson married Earlitha \"Cookie\" Kelly in a small wedding in Lansing which included guests Thomas, Aguirre, and Herb Williams. Johnson and Cookie have one son, Earvin III (EJ), who is openly gay and a star on the reality show \"Rich Kids of Beverly Hills\". The couple adopted a daughter, Elisa, in 1995. Johnson resides in Dana Point, California.\n\nJohnson is a Christian and has said his faith is \"the most important thing\" in his life.\n\nIn 2010, Magic Johnson and current and former NBA players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bill Russell, as well as Maya Moore from the WNBA, played a basketball game with President Barack Obama as an exhibition for a group of military troops who had been injured in action. The game was played at a gym inside Fort McNair, and reporters covering the president were not allowed to enter. The basketball game was part of festivities organized to celebrate Obama's 49th birthday.\n\nIn 1998, Johnson hosted a late night talk show on the Fox network called \"The Magic Hour\", but the show was canceled after two months because of low ratings. Shortly after the cancellation of his talk show, Magic Johnson started a record label. The label, initially called Magic 32 Records, was renamed Magic Johnson Music when Johnson signed a joint venture with MCA in 2000. Magic Johnson Music signed R&B artist Avant as its first act. Johnson also co-promoted Janet Jackson's Velvet Rope Tour through his company Magicworks. He has also worked as a motivational speaker, and was an NBA commentator for Turner Network Television for seven years, before becoming a studio analyst for ESPN's \"NBA Countdown\" in 2008.\n\nJohnson runs Magic Johnson Enterprises, a conglomerate company that has a net worth of $700 million; its subsidiaries include Magic Johnson Productions, a promotional company; Magic Johnson Theaters, a nationwide chain of movie theaters; and Magic Johnson Entertainment, a film studio. In addition to these business ventures, Johnson has also created the \"Magic Card\", a pre-paid MasterCard aimed at helping low-income people save money and participate in electronic commerce. In 2006, Johnson created a contract food service with Sodexo USA called Sodexo-Magic. In 2004, Johnson and his partner Ken Lombard, sold Magic Johnson Theaters to Loews Cineplex Entertainment in 2004. The first Magic Johnson Theater located in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, closed in 2010 and re-opened in 2011 as Rave Cinema 15.\n\nJohnson began thinking of life after basketball while still playing with the Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he had a meeting with Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2005–2007, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.\n\nIn 1994, Johnson became a minority owner of the Lakers, having reportedly paid more than $10 million for part ownership. He also held the title of team vice president. Johnson sold his ownership stake in the Lakers in October 2010 to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a Los Angeles surgeon and professor at UCLA, but continued as an unpaid vice president for the team. In February 2017, Johnson returned to the Lakers as an advisor to Jeanie Buss.\n\nIn the wake of the Donald Sterling controversy, limited media reports indicated that Johnson had expressed an interest in purchasing the Los Angeles Clippers franchise.\n\nIn 2015, Johnson completed his planned acquisition for a \"majority, controlling interest\" in EquiTrust Life Insurance Company, which manages $14.5 billion in annuities, life insurance and other financial products.\n\nHe is an investor for aXiomatic eSports, the ownership company of Team Liquid.\n\nIn January 2012, Johnson joined with Guggenheim Partners and Stan Kasten in a bid for ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. In March 2012, Johnson's ownership group was announced as the winner of the proceedings to buy the Dodgers. The Johnson-led group, which also includes movie executive Peter Guber, paid $2 billion for the Dodgers, the largest amount paid for a professional sports team. While Johnson is considered the leader of the ownership group, the controlling owner is Mark Walter, chief executive officer for Guggenheim Partners. Peter Guber, who is the co-owner of the Golden State Warriors, owns a small stake in the Dodgers along with Johnson.\n\nJohnson and Guber were also partners in the Dayton Dragons, a Class-A minor league baseball team in Dayton, Ohio, that sold out more than 1,000 consecutive games, a record for professional sports. Johnson and Guber sold their stake in the Dragons in 2014.\n\nTogether with Guggenheim, Johnson was also involved in the February 2014 purchase of the Los Angeles Sparks team in the WNBA. As such, in 2014, Johnson was named one of ESPNW's Impact 25. He won the WNBA championship as the owner in 2016.\n\nJohnson announced his co-ownership of a Major League Soccer expansion franchise based in Los Angeles on October 30, 2014. The temporary name was Los Angeles Football Club, which later became permanent in 2015.\n\nJohnson is a supporter of the Democratic Party. In 2006, he publicly endorsed Phil Angelides for governor of California, in 2007 he supported Hillary Clinton in her presidential campaign, and in 2010 he endorsed Barbara Boxer in her race for re-election to the US Senate. In 2012, he endorsed Barack Obama for president. He endorsed and appeared in campaign ads for unsuccessful Los Angeles mayoral candidate Wendy Greuel in 2013. In 2015, he once again endorsed Hillary Clinton in her second presidential campaign. He hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.\n\nAfter announcing his infection in November 1991, Johnson created the Magic Johnson Foundation to help combat HIV, although he later diversified the foundation to include other charitable goals. In 1992, he joined the National Commission on AIDS, a committee appointed by members of Congress and the Bush Administration. Johnson left after eight months, saying that the White House had \"utterly ignored\" the work of the panel, and had opposed the commission's recommendations, which included universal healthcare and the expansion of Medicaid to cover all low-income people with AIDS. He was also the main speaker for the United Nations (UN) World AIDS Day Conference in 1999, and has served as a United Nations Messenger of Peace.\n\nHIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals, but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups. Johnson stated that his aim was to \"help educate all people about what [HIV] is about\" and teach others not to \"discriminate against people who have HIV and AIDS\". Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease.\n\nTo prevent his HIV infection from progressing to AIDS, Johnson takes a daily combination of drugs. He has advertised GlaxoSmithKline's drugs, and partnered with Abbott Laboratories to publicize the fight against AIDS in African American communities.\n\nIn 905 NBA games, Johnson tallied 17,707 points, 6,559 rebounds, and 10,141 assists, translating to career averages of 19.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 11.2 assists per game, the highest assists per game average in NBA history. Johnson shares the single-game playoff record for assists (24), holds the Finals record for assists in a game (21), and has the most playoff assists (2,346). He is the only player to average 12 assists in an NBA Finals series, achieving it six times. He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists (22), and the All-Star Game record for career assists (127).\n\nJohnson introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called \"Showtime\", described as a mix of \"no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams.\" Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, \"There have been times when [Johnson] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody.\" Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair. In the 1982 NBA Finals, he was named the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era.\n\nJohnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players. He combined the size of a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous triple-double threats of all time; his 138 triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 181. Johnson is the only player in NBA Finals history to have triple-doubles in multiple series-clinching games.\n\nFor his feats, Johnson was voted as one of the 50 Greatest Players of All Time by the NBA in 1996, and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002. ESPN's \"SportsCentury\" ranked Johnson #17 in their \"50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century\" In 2006, ESPN.com rated Johnson the greatest point guard of all time, stating, \"It could be argued that he's the one player in NBA history who was better than Michael Jordan.\" Several of his achievements in individual games have also been named among the top moments in the NBA.\n\nJohnson and Larry Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning.\n\nSeveral journalists hypothesized that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness (\"Showtime\") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit (\"Celtic Pride\"), and between blacks and whites. The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.\n\nDespite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 Converse shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a \"friend forever\"; during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival.\n\nIn 2009, Johnson and Bird collaborated with journalist Jackie MacMullan on a non-fiction book titled \"When the Game Was Ours\". The book detailed their on-court rivalry and friendship with one another. The following year, HBO developed a documentary about their rivalry titled \"\", which was directed by Ezra Edelman.\n\nMagic Johnson had an extremely close relationship with Lakers owner Jerry Buss, whom he saw as a mentor and a father figure. Calling Buss his \"second father\" and \"one of [his] best friends\", Johnson spent five hours visiting Buss at the hospital just a few months before his death from cancer. Speaking to media just hours after Buss had died, Johnson was emotional, saying, \"Without Dr. Jerry Buss, there is no Magic.\" Buss acquired the team from Jack Kent Cooke in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the 1979 NBA draft. In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994. Johnson credits Buss with giving him the business knowledge that enabled him to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nBuss supported Johnson as he revealed his diagnosis of HIV in 1991, and he never hesitated to keep Johnson close to the organization, bringing him in as part-owner, and even as a coach.\nJohnson had never seriously considered coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching position with the Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as payback for all the years he was not the league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid. It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary. After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.\n\nJohnson's autobiography is Other biographies include:\n\n\n\n"}

He is the author of three books on China. The most recent one, \"The Hundred-Year Marathon\", is an international bestseller and was number one on the \"Washington Post\" list, and a selection of the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command, Commanders Reading List, in 2017, with Korean, Japanese, Taiwan-Chinese, PRC-Chinese, Hindi, and Mongolian editions also published. On September 26, 2018 U.S. President Donald Trump described Michael Pillsbury as \"the leading authority on China.” On November 30, 2018 The New York Times, Politico and Bloomberg articles asserted Michael Pillsbury's importance of being one of Trump's top advisers on China.”,\n\nDuring the Reagan administration, Pillsbury was the Assistant Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Planning and responsible for implementation of the program of covert aid known as the Reagan Doctrine. In 1975–76, while an analyst at the RAND Corporation, Pillsbury published articles in \"Foreign Policy\" and \"International Security\" recommending that the United States establish intelligence and military ties with China. The proposal, publicly commended by Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger, and James Schlesinger, later became US policy during the Carter and Reagan administrations.\n\nPillsbury served on the staff of four US Senate Committees from 1978–1984 and 1986–1991. As a staff member, Pillsbury drafted the Senate Labor Committee version of the legislation that enacted the US Institute of Peace in 1984. He also assisted in drafting the legislation to create the National Endowment for Democracy and the annual requirement for a DOD report on Chinese military power.\n\nIn 1992, under President George H. W. Bush, Pillsbury was Special Assistant for Asian Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, reporting to Andrew W. Marshall, Director of Net Assessment. Pillsbury is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\nIn 2015, a former CIA Director revealed that a book called \"The Hundred-Year Marathon\" \"is based on work Michael Pillsbury did that landed him the CIA Director's Exceptional Performance Award.\" The official website has declassified documents and photos that illustrate the book.\n\nPillsbury played a role in three Presidential actions:\n\nPillsbury participated in President Jimmy Carter's decision in 1979–80, as modified by President Reagan in 1981, to initiate military and intelligence ties with China.\n\nAccording to Raymond L. Garthoff, \"Michael Pillsbury first floated the idea of arms sales and broad range of American military security relationships with China in a much-discussed article in \"Foreign Policy\" in the fall of 1975. Not known then was that Pillsbury had been conducting secret talks with Chinese officials … his reports were circulated to a dozen or so top officials of the NSC, Department of Defense and Department of State as secret documents.\" According to the book \"US–China Cold War Collaboration, 1971–1989\", \"The man spearheading the effort was not a public official, and enjoyed deniability. Michael Pillsbury, a China analyst at the RAND Corporation… spent the summer of 1973 secretly meeting PLA officers stationed under diplomatic cover at China's UN mission… The DoD managed Pillsbury. Pillsbury filed a report, L-32, in March 1974… L-32 was a seminal paper on which subsequent US-PRC military cooperation blossomed.\" James Mann wrote, \"Outward appearances indicate that Pillsbury may have been working with American intelligence agencies from the very start of his relationship with General Zhang… In the fall of 1973, Pillsbury submitted a classified memo suggesting the novel idea that the United States might establish a military relationship with China… This was the genesis of the ideas of a 'China card,' the notion that the United States might use China to gain Cold War advantage over the Soviet Union. The idea would eventually come to dominate American thinking about the new relationship with China.\"\n\nPillsbury participated in President Reagan's decision in 1986 to order the CIA to arm the Afghan resistance with Stinger missiles. According to the UN Undersecretary General who negotiated the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, \"Initially, the Stinger campaign was spearheaded by Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Fred Ikle and his aggressive Coordinator for Afghan Affairs, Michael Pillsbury… The Stinger proponents won their victory in the face of overwhelming bureaucratic resistance that persisted until the very end of the struggle.\" Mann wrote, \"For Michael Pillsbury, the covert operations in Afghanistan represented the fulfillment of the decade-old dream of American military cooperation with China… To help him win the argument, Pillsbury made use of his China connections.\" George Crile stated in \"\" that, \"Ironically, neither [Gust] Avrakotos nor [Charlie] Wilson was directly involved in the decision and claims any credit.\"\n\nHarvard University's JFK School of Government published what it called the first case study of how covert action policy is made and describes the role of Michael Pillsbury. According to \"Charlie Wilson's War\", \"The moving force in this group was an engaging, well-born conservative intellectual named Mike Pillsbury, then serving as the Pentagon's deputy undersecretary in charge of overseeing covert programs. Pillsbury, a former Senate staffer and China expert, had been an early believer in the program…\" According to Philip Heymann in his 2008 book \"Living the Policy Process\", \"A policy player such as Michael Pillsbury may have absorbed many of the critical rules of the game of shared policy choice without even thinking of them as rules.\"\n\nHeymann wrote that \"providing Stinger missiles was obviously of such importance or political prominence that the President would want to decide. This decision is obviously of that character for several reasons. If approved, we may be furnishing a terrifying weapon to a present or future enemy. There is a small chance that we will encourage dangerous forms of retaliation by the Soviet Union. Even the shift from a \"plausibly deniable\" covert action to the open support of a guerrilla force fighting the Soviet Union would raise issues in Congress that the President would want to consider in light of his staff's advice.\"\n\nPillsbury worked through the secret Planning and Coordination Group. Heymann wrote, \"This committee was secret, and public details about it are sketchy… The covert action committee met every three to four weeks. Its existence was not officially acknowledged, although such a committee had operated in every administration since Eisenhower. In the Kennedy administration, for example, it was known as the Forty Committee. Any information on covert actions was protected under a compartmentalized security system given the name VEIL.\"\n\nAccording to Steve Coll, in 1985–1986 Osama Bin Laden also wanted US weapons including the Stinger missiles. Coll wrote, \"Michael Pillsbury flies to the Afghan frontier to review training facilities used by two Afghan warlords, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf… Bin Laden family head Salem bin Laden asks the Pentagon to supply anti-aircraft missiles to Arab volunteers fighting in the Soviet-Afghan War. The request is made on behalf of Salem's brother Osama [Bin Laden], who is establishing a semi-autonomous group of Arab volunteers outside the direct control of local Afghan commanders and will set up a camp just for Arabs later this year… Later research will indicate that there is no formal decision by the Reagan administration not to supply the missiles or other equipment to the Arab volunteers. Pentagon official Michael Pillsbury will later say he was not aware of any such decision, but if such a decision had been taken, he would have been aware of it.\"\n\nIn 1997–2007, Pillsbury published research reports and two books on China's view of future warfare. According to the \"Wall Street Journal\" in 2005, Pillsbury's findings were added to the reports the Secretary of Defense sent to Congress on Chinese military power in 2002–2005. In 2003, Pillsbury signed a nonpartisan report of the Council on Foreign Relations task force on Chinese military power. The task force found that China is pursuing a deliberate course of military modernization, but is at least two decades behind the United States in terms of military technology and capability. The task force report stated it was a \"nonpartisan approach to measuring the development of Chinese military power.\" He has discussed the threat the people's republic of China poses to the United States of America with Tucker Carlson.\n\nPillsbury's scholarship has been questioned by \"Washington Monthly\" assistant editor Soyoung Ho, in his article \"Panda Slugger, the dubious scholarship of Michael Pillsbury, the China hawk with Rumsfeld's ear\", published in the July/August issue in 2006.\n\nSince May 2014, Pillsbury has been a frequent guest on Voice of America Chinese providing opinions and participating in discussion in Mandarin Chinese typically on defense-related issues.\n\n\n\nAuthor of two books on China, available at National Defense University Press:\n\n\n\n\nSome of these are available online:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3242903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3242903", "title": "Mushulatubbee", "text": "Mushulatubbee\n\nMushulatubbee (Choctaw \"\", \"Determined to Kill\") (born c. 1750–1770, died c. 1838) was the chief of the Choctaw \"Okla Tannap\" (\"Lower Towns\"), one of the three major Choctaw divisions during the early 19th century. When the Principal Chief Greenwood LeFlore stayed in Mississippi at the time of removal, Mushulatubbee was elected as principal chief, leading the tribe to Indian Territory.\n\nIn 1812 he had led his warriors to assist General Andrew Jackson in the war against the Creek Red Sticks, known as the Creek Wars.\n\nIn December 1824 Mushulatubbee was one of three principal chiefs leading a Choctaw delegation to Washington to seek help against encroaching European-American settlers. Pushmataha and Apuckshunubbee were the other chiefs; Apuckshunubbee, age 80, died before they reached Washington, and Pushmataha died of illness in the capital soon after their meeting with the government.\n\nOn 26 September 1830, together with the Principal Chief Greenwood LeFlore and others, Mushulatubbee signed the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, which ceded to the US government most of the remaining Choctaw territory in Mississippi and Alabama in exchange for territory in Indian Territory. Other spellings for his name include: \"Mosholetvbbi\", \"AmoshuliTvbi\", \"Musholatubbee\", \"Moshaleh Tubbee\", and \"Mushulatubba\".\n\nThe great Shawnee leader Tecumseh visited Mushulatubbee in 1811 when he came south to get support for his Great Confederacy, in an effort to push out the European Americans. Today it is known as Tecumseh's Confederacy. Tecumseh met Moshulatubbee at his village Mashulaville (located in present-day Noxubee County, Mississippi). He was chief of \"Okla Tannap\" (Lower Towns), the southern division of the three major geographic and clan Choctaw areas of settlement. Other major divisions were in the northeast, including part of Alabama; and the west, near Vicksburg. Mushulatubbee had sympathy for Tecumseh and his cause, but decided he was too old to do anything for the confederacy, so remained neutral.\n\nIn addition to fighting with Jackson and his forces against the Creek, Mushulatubbee led 52 Choctaw warriors in the Battle of New Orleans in 1814. They fought in the swamps and cypress trees, picking off many British pickets and demoralizing them. They kept shooting down the Red Coats, as they were fighting for their homeland. When the Battle of New Orleans was over, Moshulatubbee and his 52 warriors returned home. They left the service on January 27, 1815, from Fort Stoddard.\n\nUnder continuing pressure from European-American settlers and the United States government, Mushulatubbee signed the Treaty of the Choctaw Trading House on 24 October 1816, and the Treaty Ground on 18 October 1820 to cede land. The US failed to prevent settlers from continuing to encroach on Choctaw territory.\n\nIn 1824, Pushmataha, Mushulatubee, and Apuckshunubbee, the three chiefs of the Choctaw regional divisions, became concerned about the encroaching settlement of European Americans and the unwillingness of local authorities to respect Indian land titles. They still hoped to offset the government's push for removal west of the Mississippi River and resolved to take their case to the Federal government in Washington, D.C. Pushmataha led the delegation; they sought either expulsion of white settlers from deeded lands in Arkansas, or compensation in land and cash for such lands. The group also consisted of Talking Warrior, Red Fort, \"Nittahkachee\", Col. Robert Cole and David Folsom, both (mixed-race) Choctaw; Captain Daniel McCurtain; and Major John Pitchlynn, the U.S. Interpreter.\n\nThey planned to travel the Natchez Trace to Nashville, then to Lexington, Kentucky; onward to Maysville, Kentucky; across the Ohio River (called the \"Spaylaywitheepi\" by the Shawnee) northward to Chillicothe, Ohio (former principal town of the Shawnee); then finally east over the \"National Highway\" to Washington City.\nWhile in Washington, the chief also met with the Marquis de Lafayette, who was visiting Washington, D.C. for the last time. He hailed him as a fellow aged warrior who, though foreign, rose to high renown in the American cause.\n\nIn 1830 Mushulatubbee announced his candidacy for office in Mississippi in the \"Port Gibson Correspondent\", as reported by the \"Christian Mirror and N.H. Observer\" (15 July 1830).\n\nThe US government forced the Choctaw to remove to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Mushulatubbee was the chief of his division during the removal and for a time after their resettlement in what became Oklahoma. The government had encouraged the Choctaw to resettle in their former clan divisions. Relocation soon led to changes in the society in which those clan divisions became less important.\n\nIn 1838 Mushulatubbee died of smallpox in present-day Arkansas and was buried near Cameron, Oklahoma in Le Flore County, Oklahoma.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2163246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163246", "title": "Muslim ibn Aqeel", "text": "Muslim ibn Aqeel\n\nMuslim ibn Aqil Al-Hashimi (Arabic: مسلم بن عقيل الهاشمي) was the son of Aqeel ibn Abi Talib and a member of the clan of Bani Hashim, thus, he is a cousin of Husayn ibn Ali. The people of Kufa called upon Husayn to overthrow the Umayyad dynasty who was on his way to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage. He wanted to confirm the loyalty of the people of Kufa, so he sent his cousin and his ambassador, Muslim ibn Aqeel, a famous warrior, to Kufa to observe the situation. He sent a letter to Husayn confirming their loyalty, before knowing that the 30,000 followers that he gained would all betray him. He was executed by the newly installed governor, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, on the 20th of Rabi Ul Awal, 60 AH, and is buried at the back of Great Mosque of Kufa.\n\nHusayn ibn Ali received thousands of letters from people of Kufa stating that they were rejecting their governor and asking him to come and serve as their Imam. One letter in particular contained these words: \"“We invite you to come to Kufa as we have no Imam to guide us. Through you Allah will unite us on the path of truth.”\" A few days later, the people of Kufa sent an emissary, a special messenger, to Husayn ibn Ali to persuade him to go to Kufa. There followed hundreds of other letters and many special emissaries from the people of Kufa to Husayn ibn Ali.\n\nReceiving so many petitions and messages from Kufa, Husayn ibn Ali decided to send Muslim ibn Aqeel, who was a famous warrior, as his emissary to Kufa to study the situation there and report to Husayn ibn Ali.\n\nHe wrote a letter to the people of Kufa and gave it to Muslim ibn Aqeel. In this letter Husayn ibn Ali said, \"“I am sending my cousin and one of the most trusted ones from my family, Muslim ibn Aqeel, to report to me about your affairs. If his report agrees with what you have written I will soon be with you. You must be clear of the fact that the Imam is the only one who follows the book of Allah, and serves Allah in all matters and affairs with justice, honesty and truth.”\"\n\nHusayn ibn Ali also told Ibn Aqeel: \"“Muslim, the whole world knows that you are one of the bravest warriors. It is just possible that seeing you in Kufa some people may think that our intention is to fight Yazid. Take your two sons Muhammad and Ibrahim with you. When they see you with such young children, they will know that our intentions are peaceful.”\"\n\nAccording to reports, Muslim ibn Aqeel’s sons were so young, that they could not even tie up the buttons of their shirts.\n\nHusayn sent three people with Muslim: Qays Ibn Mash'ar, 'Imarah Ibn 'Abdullah al-Saluli, and 'Abdul Rahman Ibn 'Abdullah al-Azd, in addition to the messenger from Kufa.\n\nThis group set off from Mecca on the 15th of Ramadan. His first destination was Medina, where he left his family and hired two people to guide him on his way. The guides, however, lost their way in the desert and were too weak from lack of water to continue on. But in their weakened physical state, they managed to show Muslim the right direction before they both died of thirst.\n\nMuslim arrived in Kufa on 5 Shawwal 60 AH/ 9 July 680. He went first to the house of al-Mukhtar ibn Abu 'Ubayd al-Thaqafi, who was highly liked by his people and who later became the person who ordered the murder of Ibn Ziyad.\n\nMore than 18,000-30,000 people appeared before Muslim ibn Aqeel and enthusiastically pledged their allegiance to Husayn ibn Ali as their Imam and pledged to support Husayn even with their lives. Muslim ibn Aqeel, encouraged by this response, reported to Husayn ibn Ali by letter that he should proceed to Kufa.\n\nThe governor of Kufa, al-Nu'man Ibn Bashir, was told of Muslim's arrival, but refused to attack him. Bashir was a mild man and did not want to harm the members of the family of the Prophet, so he did nothing to stop Muslim. Many of the supporters of Yazid saw this lack of action as a sign of weakness and encouraged the caliph to replace Bashir with a stronger man. Yazid then deposed Bashir and replaced him with Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Ibn Ziyad was a resourceful and often cruel politician who spared nothing in order to attain political ends. His strong and ruthless character was exactly what the caliph was looking for in order to gain control in Kufa. Yazid wrote to him, \"Go to Kufa, capture Muslim ibn 'Aqil and see what is appropriate to imprison him, send him to exile or kill him.\" \n\nThe morning of his arrival in Kufa, Ibn Ziyad gathered the people at the grand mosque. There he delivered a speech warning them against mutiny and promised them generous rewards for conforming. He said, \"\"Anyone found to be sheltering one of those who scheme against the authority of the commander of the faithful and who does not hand him over will be crucified on the door of his own house\".\" \n\nDuring this time, Ibn Ziyad was working diligently to discover the hiding place of Muslim. He knew that the people of Kufa were meeting secretly, but he was not able to figure out the location. Ibn Ziyad decided that the best way to find Muslim would be to infiltrate his inner circle. He called upon his servant, Ma'qil, to meet him. He gave Ma'qil three thousand dirhams and ordered him to meet with the Shi'as. He was to tell them that he was a Syrian slave who has just arrived in the country and wanted to hand deliver a donation to Muslim. Ma'qil entered the grand mosque and was introduced to Muslim. Ma'qil then delivered the money and swore allegiance to him. This servant continued to meet with Muslim in the coming days. No secrets were kept from him, so he kept gathering information, which he then reported back to Ibn Ziyad in the evenings.\n\nWith the information from Ma'qil, Ibn Ziyad was able to figure out that Muslim was staying at the house of Hani. The governor gathered some of the friends of Hani and asked why he had not visited in quite a while. They made excuses for him, saying that he had been sick and other similar things. Hani was then summoned by the governor who accused him of harboring Muslim in his house. Hani denied this claim and things got heated. Ibn Ziyad then called in Ma'qil and had him corroborate the story that Ibn Ziyad was trying to paint. At this point, Hani was arrested, beaten in the face with an iron-tipped cane, and thrown into prison and was later executed with Muslim ibn Aqeel.\n\nMuslim reported to Husayn through Abis ibn Shabib that most of the people in Kufa were ready to receive him as their Imam and advised that Husayn should proceed to Kufa (Tareekh-e-Tabri, Vol.6, Page211). Amongst the people of Kufa there were many spies employed by Yazid to report to him directly. When Yazid heard from them of the invitations to Hussain and the arrival in Kufa of Muslim he was filled with fury. He sent a message to his Governor in Basrah, Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, to go to Kufa and take over the position of Nu'amaan ibne Basheer. Ibn Ziyad was also told to arrest Muslim and murder him and do all that was necessary to suppress the Shiahs in Kufa.\n\nIbn Ziyad was a shrewd man. He kept his journey from Basra to Kufa a secret and just before entering Kufa he covered his face with a black scarf so that he could not be recognized. He had a few horsemen in front of him and a few behind him as he entered Kufa. The people of Kufa had been waiting for the arrival of Imam Hussain anxiously and they presumed that the Imam had arrived. Soon people started gathering around him and singing welcoming songs. Ibn Ziyad kept observing the people and memorizing faces as the crowd grew and soon it was difficult for his convoy to proceed swiftly. One of his guards, Muslim bin Amr Bahili, shouted \"Clear the way, this is the Amir Ubaidullah ibn Ziyad\". Hearing this, people started running away quickly and when Ibn Ziyad reached the Dar-al-Amara only a handful people had been left. Ibn Ziyad arrived in Kufa on the evening of 2nd Dhul-Hajj. On the following day he went to the mosque and addressed the people of Kufa. He first announced his appointment as Yazid's governor. He then threatened any one who was engaged in any activity against the government with immediate death, and ordered them to surrender Muslim to him.\n\nIbn Ziyad sealed Kufa in such a way that no one could go in or out of the city without the governor's permission.\n\nSince several people knew that he was staying with Mukhtar Thaqafi, Muslim decided to move from there as a measure of precaution and protection. At the invitation of Hani ibn Urwah, another leading member of the Shia community, he moved to Hani's house. This was done secretly and except for a few people no one knew where Muslim was. Through a spy, Maaqal, who pretended to be a Shia, Ibn Ziyad found out where Muslim was. Since ibn Ziyad had prior relations with Hani, he called him by trick to his palace and got him arrested and thrown into prison. Muslim got the news of Hani's arrest and not wishing to further endanger the lives of his friends, Muslim and his two sons left Hani's house. He left the children with Shurayb, a judge, and went into the desert to try to get back to Husayn to warn him not to go to Kufa. This was the 7th of Dhul-Hajj. That whole day and the following day Muslim tried to get out of the city. He found all the exits sealed and guarded by Ibn Ziyad's soldiers.\n\nOn the 7th, late in the evening, tired, hungry and exhausted, Muslim knocked on the door of a house on the outskirts of the city. A lady named 'Tuwaa\" opened the door. Muslim requested for a little water to quench his thirst. The lady gave him water. When she learnt who he was, she invited him in and offered him shelter for the night. She gave Muslim food and water and took him to a room where he spent the night.\n\nLate that night Tuwaa's son came home. When he learned that the man Ibn Ziyad was looking for was in his mother's house, he felt that he would be rewarded by the governor if he got Muslim arrested. Unknown to his mother he slipped out in the darkness of the night and gave the information to a captain in Ibn Ziyad's army. Early the next morning, five hundred soldiers under the leadership of Mohammad bin Ashas surrounded the house of Tuwaa and demanded Muslim's surrender. Muslim came out holding his sword. Three times he drove the enemy away and killed 150 men. Twice Ibn Ziyad had to send in reinforcements.\n\nWhile Muslim was fighting, some soldiers went up the rooftops and began throwing stones and lighted torches at him. Others dug a trench in the path of Muslim and covered it with grass. Ibn Ziyad told his commanders to trick Muslim otherwise it would not be possible to capture him. Although badly wounded and totally exhausted, Muslim kept on fighting. As a trick, soldiers of Ibn Ziyad offered peace and protection to Muslim but he rejected the offer. He was deeply wounded in this tough fight and finally fell into the trench. He was pounced upon, chained and dragged to the court of Ibn Ziyad.\n\nHistorians narrate that Muslim was badly wounded when he entered the court of Ibn Ziyad. His teeth were broken and blood was flowing from all over. Still he entered the court like a 'Lion'. Someone in the court told him to pay respect to Ibn Ziyad because he is the \"Amir\" (Ruler). Muslim refused and replied that his Amir was only Husayn.\n\nIbn Ziyad told Muslim that he would be killed and asked him if he had any last wishes. Muslim replied saying, \"I owe a debt which should be discharged by selling off my sword and armour. Secondly I want my body to be given a proper burial. Thirdly I want a message sent to Hussain advising him not to come to Kufa.\" Ibn Ziyad agreed to the first request but refused to do anything about the second and third requests. He then ordered Muslim to be taken to the roof of the palace to be executed and his body thrown to the ground.\n\nMuslim was calm and composed as he was dragged up the steps. He was reciting \"Allahu Akber\" until the last moment. Then there was an absolute silence followed by a thud as the head of Muslim was chopped and his body fell to the ground. This was on the 9th of Dhul-Hujja. Immediately after Muslim was killed, Hani ibn Urwah as well was dragged to the roof top and executed.\n\nIbn Ziyad ordered Muqair Ibn Obran-e-Ahmari to take him to the palace's roof. They went to the top of the fortress, Muslim was decapitated in front of the people, his head was thrown down first and then followed by his body. Hani was also executed. They were executed in this way in order to intimidate the populace. Ibn Ziyad ordered that the bodies of these two men be dragged by their feet through the streets and marketplaces in Kufa. Muslim's body was then crucified upside down and the heads of Muslim and Hani were sent to Yazid to be displayed on the streets of Damascus.\n\nMuslim bin Aqeel’s two sons, Mohammad and Ibrahim, were also killed in Kufa.\n\nMuslim called on the people of Kufa for assistance and narrations say that approximately 40,000 people accompanied him to the government building. By then, Ibn Ziyad had placed the leaders of Kufa on the roof top of the building and threatened to kill them if they did not leave Muslim bin Aqeel.\n\nWithin a short while, not one person from the 40,000 was with Muslim.\n\nMuslim was later taken by the soldiers of Ibn Ziyaad and was martyred. Later, the two sons of Muslim were also martyred. These were two young children who accompanied their father, thinking that they were journeying to a place that was filled with true followers of the Ahle Bait.\n\nOn receiving the letter of Muslim, Hussain departed from Makkah and left for Kufa. When this group of the Ahlul Bayt left Makkah, every person and every child stood watching them with sadness as they left.\n\nTheir eyes filled with tears and their hearts heavy with sadness. On his way, he received news of the death of Muslim and his children. Hussain was also informed of the betrayal of the people of Kufa. He was very sad when he heard this news and read In'na lil'laahi Wa in'na ilaihi Raaji'oon. He then comforted the family members and gave them hope.\n\nWhen the Ahlul Bayt reached a place called Thaa'lba, Hussain rested for a while. He awoke with tears in his eyes. His beloved sister, Zainab asked the reason for this, and he said, \"I dreamt of our grandfather, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was crying and he said \"O Hussain! You are soon to come and meet with me.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Ali Akbar the son of Hussain said, \" O my dear father! Are we not on Haq (truth)?\" Hussain replied, \"verily we are on Haq and Haq is with us.\" Then Ali Akbar said, \"why then should we fear death, O my father? We all must pass from this world one day. I am seeing the gardens of Shahaadat and a mansion better than that of the world and bounties even greater than that of this world are before us.\"\n\nWhile Muslim was not killed at Karbala, he is counted as one of the martyrs of the battle.\n\nThe Shi'ite recommend visiting his grave in Kufa and there are certain prayers that are to be recited there.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the mausoleum of Ruqayyah bint Ali (Wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel) located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Legend has it that it holds the graves of six ladies (one is Ruqqayah herself and others are Muslim's sisters) from Muhammad's household (Ahl Al-Bayt).\n\nToday, Muslim ibn Aqeel's descendants go by the surname \"Uqaili\" and are found in Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq.\n\n\n"}

In 2018 he was arrested on politically-motivated charges, sparking an international campaign by human rights groups calling for his release. On 8 October 2018, Oyub Titiev was awarded the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize, which honours \"outstanding\" defence of human rights in Europe and beyond.\nOyub Titiev’s ancestors were among the first settlers of the village Kurchaloi, Chechnya. However, as a result of the deportation of Chechens in March 1944 he was born in the village of Lebedinovka in the Kyrgyz SSR. He later returned to Kurchaloi, Chechnya. Active in wrestling and weightlifting, Titiev became a physical education teacher and created a local children's sports club, which has produced a number of professional athletes. \n\nSince 2000, he has worked for Memorial and for the Civic Assistance Committee, documenting human rights abuses in Chechnya and overseeing humanitarian projects such as assisting schools in Chechnya’s mountain regions or defending Muslims from discrimination in the criminal justice system. After the assassination of Natalya Estemirova in 1999, he became the head of Memorial in Chechnya.\n\nOn 9 January 2018 Oyub Titiev left Kurchaloi, traveling towards Mairtup, Chechnya, where he was supposed to meet a friend at 9:00 am. According to the official version, his Lada Kalina was stopped to verify his documents. Upon inspecting the car, the police officers found “a polymer bag with a substance of plant origin with the specific smell of marijuana, weighing approximately 180 grams.” Titiev was then detained and taken to the Kurchaloevsky police station for medical examination, while the packet with the substance was sent for expert analysis. That same day, Memorial reported his detention.\n\nOn 11 January 2018, the Shalinsk city court arrested Titiev until March 9 on request of the investigator. The human rights activist was accused of breaking Part 2 Article 228 of the Criminal Code (the illegal acquisition, storage, and transportation of drugs). Titiev denied guilt and in a statement sent to the Investigatory Committee of the Chechen Republic accused the police officers of planting the illegal drugs under his passenger’s seat while inspecting his car. On 12 January, his defense appealed the two-month arrest. \n\nMemorial representative Aleksandr Cherkasov said that Titiev’s arrest was related to his professional work which was “met with disapproval from Chechen authorities.” The representative of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, said that the council had already appealed to the Ministry of Internal Affairs on January 10th to verify Titiev’s detention and investigate the situation. \n\nOn 24 January, Aleksandr Cherkasov appealed to the Russian and international community on behalf of Memorial, urging them to closely monitor Titiev’s case as they had with criminal proceedings against historian and head of the Karelian branch of Memorial, Yury A. Dmitriev. On January 28th, Ksenia Sobchak, then a candidate in the March 2018 Russian Presidential Elections, held a one-night-long picket in Grozny in “memory of journalists who died for a free country” with a poster reading “Freedom for Oyub Titiev.” \n\nOn 1 February the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Russia, Tatyana Moskalkova called for the investigation of the Titiev case to be passed on to the federal level. A similar opinion was expressed by the representative of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov. \n\nOn 6 March the Staropromyslov district court extended Titiev’s arrest until 9 May, while rejecting the \"poruchitelstvo\" (personal vouches, Russian: поручительство) he received from presidential candidates Grigory Yavlinsky and Kesnia Sobchak. \n\nOn 4 May, while considering an appeal to the ruling of the Staropromyslov district court, human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina and test pilot and Hero of Russia Sergey Nefedov also offered a \"poruchitelstvo\" for Titiev, which the court also rejected. \n\nA number of leading international human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Front Line Defenders, FIDH, the World Organization Against Torture) released a joint statement on 11 January, defending Titiev and Memorial’s activities in the Caucuses. On 8 February, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Oyub Titiev’s case calling for the \"immediate release of the Director of the Memorial Human Rights Centre in the Chechen Republic, Mr Oyub Titiev\". Memorial has included Titiev in their list of political prisoners.\n"}

{"id": "66027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66027", "title": "Pauline Phillips", "text": "Pauline Phillips\n\nPauline Esther \"Popo\" Phillips (née Friedman; July 4, 1918 – January 16, 2013), also known as Abigail Van Buren, was an American advice columnist and radio show host who began the \"Dear Abby\" column in 1956. During her decades writing the column, it became the most widely syndicated newspaper column in the world, syndicated in 1,400 newspapers with 110 million readers.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1975, Phillips also hosted a daily \"Dear Abby\" program on CBS Radio. TV anchorwoman Diane Sawyer calls her the \"pioneering queen of salty advice\".\n\nPauline Esther Friedman, nicknamed \"Popo\", was born in Sioux City, Iowa, to Russian Jewish immigrants, Rebecca (née Rushall) and Abraham B. Friedman, owner of a chain of movie theaters. She was the youngest of four sisters and grew up in Sioux City. Her identical twin, Esther Pauline Friedman (married name Lederer), was columnist Ann Landers. Lederer had become Ann Landers in 1955, and inspired by her sister's example, Phillips soon followed suit by launching her own advice column.\n\nIn describing her family's emigration to America, Phillips says, \"My parents came with nothing. They all came with nothing.\" She adds that her parents never forgot first seeing the \"Statue of Liberty\":\n\nHer sister, Esther, recalls their home life: \"My father was the sort of man people came to for advice. My mother couldn't turn away anyone with a hard-luck story. Our house was always full of guests.\" Phillips agrees, and understood that her parents had a clear effect on her own personality:\n\nThey are both alumnae of Central High School in Sioux City and Morningside College, where they both studied journalism and psychology, along with writing a joint gossip column for the college newspaper. They both played the violin. In July 1939, they were married in a double-wedding ceremony on July 2, two days before their 21st birthday. Pauline married Morton Phillips of Minneapolis, and had two children, a son, Edward Jay Phillips, and a daughter, Jeanne Phillips.\n\nIn her July 8, 2017 \"Dear Abby\" column, Jeanne Phillips said her mother liked being a twin while her aunt wanted to be an individual, and this caused conflict between them.\n\nPauline's writing career that led to \"Dear Abby\" began in January 1956, when she was 37 and new to the greater San Francisco area. Sometime during this period she phoned the editor of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and said she could write a better advice column than the one she had been reading in the newspaper. After hearing her modest credentials, editor Stanleigh \"Auk\" Arnold gave her some letters in need of answers and said to bring back her replies in a week; Phillips got her replies back to the \"Chronicle\" in an hour and half. In an interview with Larry King, she said she had no work experience, lacking even a social security number. The editor, however, asked if she were a professional writer. He said her writing was \"fabulous', and she was hired that day.\n\nShe went by the pen name Abigail Van Buren, after the Old Testament prophetess from the Book of Samuel: \"Then David said to Abigail ... 'Blessed is your advice and blessed are you.\" \"Van Buren\" was used after the president, Martin Van Buren.\n\nPhillips says that because she applied for the columnist job without notifying her sister first, it created bad feelings between them for many years. Each wrote her own advice column, and as competing columnists, they sometimes clashed; in 1956, Phillips offered her column to the \"Sioux City Journal\" at a reduced price, provided the paper refused to print her sister's column. The sisters ostensibly reconciled in 1964, but remained competitors. In 1958, after only two years writing their columns, they became \"the most widely read and most quoted women in the world,\" according to \"Life\" magazine.\n\nAlthough newspapers had included gossip and personal columnists for over a century, the two sisters added \"something special,\" writes \"Life\", in that they were the first to publish letters and their replies covering a wide range of personal problems. From as many as 9,000 letters in a single week in their initial years, they responded with answers to people from all walks of life, including doctors, lawyers, and clergymen, as well as from pregnant teenagers, harassed husbands, unwed mothers, alcoholics, gays, and mistresses. Setting their column apart even more from columnists of earlier decades was their particular style of writing, replying with \"vaudeville punch lines\" yet always rooted in common sense. Phillips is described thusly by the \"New York Times\":\n\nPhillips was considered liberal minded politically, yet personally conservative. She remained reluctant to advise unmarried couples to live together, for instance, until the 1990s, yet she adapted readily to social changes. One example:\n\nBoth Phillips and her sister were considered remarkable women soon after starting their careers, recognized for being bright and entertaining, and writing with \"an earthy wit, audacity and awesome self-confidence,\" often exemplified in Phillips' \"crackling one-liners.\" The editor of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" described their skill as \"beyond mere shrewdness—a quality very close to genuine wisdom.\" Amy Dickinson, a syndicated advice columnist who styles her columns after \"Dear Abby,\" says that Phillips was a \"master\" in her ability to write with both \"genuine honesty\" and \"compassion,\" while at the same time being able to respond with \"tough love\" when needed:\n\nThe letters that Phillips and her sister each picked for publication were meant to give the public glimpses of \"the most intimate of human difficulties,\" which contributed to their immediate acceptance. \"Life\" magazine explains:\n\nPhillips stated that the most sensitive letters she received were never published, but were instead replied to individually. Sometimes she would write a brief note on the letter itself, letting one of her secretaries respond fully using her advice. If a person seemed suicidal from their letter, she would call them on the phone. As noted by \"Life\":\n\nAs part of their work both sisters engaged with other editors, publishers, and the general public whenever they could. \"Neither ever forgets a name,\" and they were uninhibited public speakers: they \"whirl around the country appearing on radio and television and—dressed like visiting movie actresses—holding thousands of housewives spellbound in speeches at theaters and auditoriums.\"\n\nLike her sister, Phillips was considered \"the embodiment of female orthodoxy.\" They made their husbands and families a high priority in their lives, feeling that \"marriage must be permanent, even when disturbed by masculine lunacy.\" Phillips typically spoke in glowing terms about her husband in public, calling him \"loveboat\" or smooching with him in restaurants. This attitude carried over into their columns in the late 1950s, with Phillips considering women who were unable to make their marriages work as \"faintly ridiculous.\" Her \"code of conduct\" was \"husband and children first.\" In her later years, she did not avoid suggesting divorce when a relationship became \"intolerable\", and considered how a bad marriage might affect children: \"When kids see parents fighting, or even sniping at each other, I think it is terribly damaging.\"\nBoth Phillips and her sister enjoyed socializing with celebrities, and because of their notoriety, celebrities liked being seen with either of them. Among Phillips' friends soon after she began her column were politicians, including Senators Hubert Humphrey and Herbert Lehman; and entertainers, including Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.\n\nThey also admired Bishop Fulton Sheen, whom they met when learning about Catholicism while studying about other religions. The bishop admired them both in return due to their ability to remain \"unawed\" and unaffected by the fame of others. Phillips, who was Jewish, commented: \"He's one of the greatest men I ever met, but he'll be a Jew before I'm a Catholic.\" Phillips and Bishop Sheen corresponded often and she recalls their letters:\n\nPhillips was an honorary member of Women in Communications, the American College of Psychiatrists, and the National Council of Jewish Women. She authored six books: \"Dear Abby\", \"Dear Teenager\", \"Dear Abby on Marriage\", \"Where Were You When President Kennedy was Shot?\", \"The Dear Abby Wedding Planner\", and \"The Best of Dear Abby\". \"The Dear Abby Show\" aired on the CBS Radio Network for 12 years. When asked near the end of her career whether her years of writing the column were a lot of work, she said, \"It's only work if you'd rather be doing something else.\" She felt that her career had been \"fulfilling, exciting and incredibly rewarding.\"\n\nAfter some point in life Phillips stopped driving. Her daughter Jeanne said, \"She quit after skidding into the back of a coal truck during a Wisconsin winter,\" with Jeanne having a life-long scar from the crash.\n\nFrom 1987 until her mother's retirement, her daughter Jeanne co-wrote the column. In 2002, when Phillips' Alzheimer's disease made it impossible for her to continue writing, Jeanne assumed all the writing responsibilities of \"Dear Abby\". After the family's announcement of Pauline's illness, Jeanne assumed the pen name Abigail Van Buren.\n\nPhillips died on January 16, 2013, at the age of 94, after having battled Alzheimer's disease for 11 years. She was survived by her husband of 73 years, Morton Phillips, daughter Jeanne Phillips, four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Her son, Edward, died in 2011 at the age of 66.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1032186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1032186", "title": "Phanariotes", "text": "Phanariotes\n\nPhanariotes, Phanariots, or Phanariote Greeks (, , ) were members of prominent Greek families in Phanar (Φανάρι, modern \"Fener\"), the chief Greek quarter of Constantinople where the Ecumenical Patriarchate is located, who traditionally occupied four important positions in the Ottoman Empire: Grand Dragoman, Grand Dragoman of the Fleet, Hospodar of Moldavia, and Hospodar of Wallachia. Despite their cosmopolitanism and often-Western education, the Phanariotes were aware of their Hellenism; according to Nicholas Mavrocordatos' \"Philotheou Parerga\", \"We are a race completely Hellenic\".\n\nThey emerged as a class of moneyed Greek merchants (of mostly noble Byzantine descent) during the second half of the 16th century, and were influential in the administration of the Ottoman Empire's Balkan domains in the 18th century. The Phanariotes usually built their houses in the Phanar quarter to be near the court of the Patriarch, who (under the Ottoman millet system) was recognized as the spiritual and secular head (\"millet-bashi\") of the Orthodox subjects—the Rum Millet, or \"Roman nation\" of the empire, except those under the spiritual care of the patriarchs of Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Ohrid and Peć—often acting as archontes of the Ecumenical See. They dominated the administration of the patriarchate, often intervening in the selection of hierarchs (including the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople).\n\nMany members of Phanariot families (who had acquired great wealth and influence during the 17th century) occupied high political and administrative posts in the Ottoman Empire. From 1669 until the Greek War of Independence in 1821, Phanariotes made up the majority of the dragomans to the Ottoman government (the Porte) and foreign embassies due to the Greeks' higher level of education than the general Ottoman population. With the church dignitaries, local notables from the provinces and the large Greek merchant class, Phanariotes represented the better-educated members of Greek society during Ottoman rule until the 1821 start of the Greek War of Independence. During the war, Phanariotes influenced decisions by the Greek National Assembly (the representative body of Greek revolutionaries, which met six times between 1821 and 1829). Between 1711–1716 and 1821, a number of Phanariotes were appointed Hospodars (voivodes or princes) in the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) (usually as a promotion from dragoman offices); the period is known as the Phanariote epoch in Romanian history.\n\nAfter the fall of Constantinople, Mehmet II deported the city's Christian population, leaving only the Jewish inhabitants of Balat, repopulating the city with Christians and Muslims from throughout the whole empire and the newly conquered territories. Phanar was repopulated with Greeks from Mouchlion in the Peloponnese and, after 1461, with citizens of Trebizond.\n\nThe roots of Greek ascendancy can be traced to the Ottoman need for skilled, educated negotiators as their empire declined and they relied on treaties rather than force. During the 17th century, the Ottomans began having problems in foreign relations and difficulty dictating terms to their neighbours; for the first time, the Porte needed to participate in diplomatic negotiations.\n\nWith the Ottomans traditionally ignoring Western European languages and cultures, officials were at a loss. The Porte assigned those tasks to the Greeks, who had a long mercantile and educational tradition and the necessary skills. The Phanariotes, Greek and Hellenized families primarily from Constantinople, occupied high posts as secretaries and interpreters for Ottoman officials.\n\nAs a result of Phanariote and ecclesiastical administration, the Greeks expanded their influence in the 18th-century empire while retaining their Greek Orthodox faith and Hellenism. This had not always been the case in the Ottoman realm. During the 16th century, the South Slavs—the most prominent in imperial affairs—converted to Islam to enjoy the full rights of Ottoman citizenship (especially in the Eyalet of Bosnia; Serbs tended to occupy high military positions.\n\nA Slavic presence in Ottoman administration gradually became hazardous for its rulers, since the Slavs tended to support Habsburg armies during the Great Turkish War. By the 17th century the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople was the religious and administrative ruler of the empire's Orthodox subjects, regardless of ethnic background. All formerly-independent Orthodox patriarchates, including the Serbian Patriarchate renewed in 1557, came under the authority of the Greek Orthodox Church. Most of the Greek patriarchs were drawn from the Phanariotes.\n\nTwo Greek social groups emerged, challenging the leadership of the Greek Church: the Phanariotes in Constantinople and the local notables in the Helladic provinces (\"kodjabashis\", \"dimogerontes\" and \"prokritoi\"). According to 19th-century Greek historian Constantine Paparrigopoulos, the Phanariotes initially sought the most important secular offices of the patriarchical court and could frequently intervene in the election of bishops and influence crucial decisions by the patriarch. Greek merchants and clergy of Byzantine aristocratic origin, who acquired economic and political influence and were later known as Phanariotes, settled in extreme northwestern Constantinople (which had become central to Greek interests after the establishment of the patriarch's headquarters in 1461, shortly after Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque).\n\nAfter the 1453 fall of Constantinople, when the Sultan replaced \"de jure\" the Byzantine emperor for subjugated Christians, he recognized the Ecumenical Patriarch as the religious and national leader (\"ethnarch\") of the Greeks and other ethnic groups in the Greek Orthodox \"Millet\". The Patriarchate had primary importance, occupying this key role for Christians of the Empire because the Ottomans did not legally distinguish between nationality and religion and considered the empire's Orthodox Christians a single entity.\n\nThe position of the Patriarchate in the Ottoman state encouraged Greek renaissance projects centering on the resurrection and revitalization of the Byzantine Empire. The Patriarch and his church dignitaries constituted the first centre of power for the Greeks in the Ottoman state, which infiltrated Ottoman structures and attracted the former Byzantine nobility.\n\nThe wealth of the extensive Greek merchant class provided the material basis for the intellectual revival featured in Greek life for more than half a century before 1821. Greek merchants endowed libraries and schools. On the eve of the Greek War of Independence, the three most important centres of Greek learning (schools-cum-universities) were in the commercial centres of Chios, Smyrna and Aivali. The first Greek millionaire of the Ottoman era was Michael \"Şeytanoğlu\" Kantakouzenos, who earned 60,000 ducats a year from his control of the fur trade from Muscovy.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Phanariotes were a hereditary clerical−aristocratic group who managed the affairs of the patriarchate and the dominant political power of the Ottoman Greek community. They became a significant political factor in the empire and, as diplomatic agents, played a role in the affairs of Great Britain, France and the Russian Empire.\n\nThe Phanariotes competed for the most important administrative offices in the Ottoman administration; these included collecting imperial taxes, monopolies on commerce, working under contract in a number of enterprises, supplying the court and ruling the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia). They engaged in private trade, controlling the crucial wheat trade on the Black Sea. The Phanariotes expanded their commercial activities into the Kingdom of Hungary and then to the other Central European states. Their activities intensified their contacts with Western nations, and they became familiar with Western languages and cultures.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, the Phanariotes were firmly established as the political elite of Hellenism. According to Greek historian Constantine Paparrigopoulos, this was a natural evolution given the Phanariotes' education and experience in supervising large parts of the empire. According to Nikos Svoronos argued, the Phanariotes subordinated their national identity to their class identity and tried to peacefully co−exist with the Ottomans; they did not enrich the Greek national identity and lost ground to groups which flourished through their confrontation with the Ottoman Empire (the \"klephts\" and \"armatoloi\").\n\nA Greek presence had established itself in both provinces, resulting in the appointment of Greek princes before the 18th century. After the Phanariote era, families of Phanariote ancestry in Wallachia and Moldavia identified themselves as Romanian in Romanian society (including the Rosetti family; C. A. Rosetti represented the radical, nationalist cause during and after the 1848 Wallachian revolution.\n\nPhanariote attention focused on occupying the most favorable offices the empire could offer non-Muslims and the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, which were still relatively rich and—more importantly—autonomous (despite having to pay tribute as vassal states). Many Greeks had found favorable conditions there for commercial activities, in comparison with the Ottoman Empire, and an opportunity for political power; they entered Wallachian and Moldavian boyar nobility by marriage.\n\nReigns of local princes were not excluded on principle. Several hellenized Romanian noble families, such as the Callimachis (originally \"Călmașul\"), the Ghicas or the Racovițăs, penetrated the Phanar nucleus to increase their chances of occupying the thrones and maintain their positions.\n\nMost sources agree that 1711 was when the gradual erosion of traditional institutions reached its zenith, but characteristics ascribed to the Phanariote era had made themselves felt long before it. The Ottomans enforced their choice of hospodars as far back as the 15th century, and foreign (usually Greek or Levantine) boyars competed with local ones since the late 16th century. Rulers since Dumitraşcu Cantacuzino in Moldavia and George Ducas (a prince of Greek origin) in Wallachia, both in 1673, were forced to surrender their family members as hostages in Constantinople. The traditional elective system in the principalities, resulting in long periods of political disorder, was dominated by a small number of ambitious families who competed violently for the two thrones and monopolized land ownership.\n\nA change in policy was indicated by the fact that autonomous Wallachia and Moldavia had entered a period of skirmishes with the Ottomans, due to the insubordination of local princes associated with the rise of Imperial Russia's power under Peter the Great and the firm presence of the Habsburg Empire on the Carpathian border with the principalities. Dissidence in the two countries became dangerous for the Turks, who were confronted with the attraction on the population of protection by a fellow Eastern Orthodox state. This became obvious with Mihai Racoviță's second rule in Moldavia, when the prince plotted with Peter to have Ottoman rule overthrown. His replacement, Nicholas Mavrocordatos, was the first official Phanariote in his second reign in Moldavia and replaced Ștefan Cantacuzino in Wallachia as the first Phanariote ruler of that country.\n\nA crucial moment was the Russo−Turkish War of 1710−1713, when Dimitrie Cantemir sided with Russia and agreed to Russian tutelage of his country. After Russia experienced a major defeat and Cantemir went into exile, the Ottomans took charge of the succession to the throne of Moldavia. This was followed by similar measures in Wallachia, prompted by Ștefan Cantacuzino's alliance with Habsburg commander Prince Eugene of Savoy in the closing stages of the Great Turkish War.\n\nThe person raised to the office of prince was usually the chief dragoman of the Porte, well-versed in contemporary politics and Ottoman statecraft. The new prince, who obtained his office in exchange for a generous bribe, proceeded to the country he was selected to govern (whose language he usually did not know). When the new princes were appointed, they were escorted to Iași or Bucharest by retinues composed of their families, favourites and creditors (from whom they had borrowed the bribes). The prince and his appointees counted on recouping these in as short a time as possible, amassing an amount sufficient to live on after their brief time in office.\n\nThirty-one princes, from eleven families, ruled the two principalities during the Phanariote epoch. When the choice became limited to a few families due to princely disloyalty to the Porte, rulers would be moved from one principality to the other; the prince of Wallachia (the richer of the two principalities) would pay to avert his transfer to Iaşi, and the prince of Moldavia would bribe supporters in Constantinople to appoint him to Wallachia. Constantine Mavrocordatos ruled a total of ten times in Moldavia and Wallachia. The debt was owed to several creditors, rather than to the Sultan; the central institutions of the Ottoman Empire generally seemed determined to maintain their rule over the principalities and not exploit them irrationally. In an early example, Ahmed III paid part of Nicholas Mavrocordatos' sum.\n\nThe Phanariote epoch was initially characterized by fiscal policies driven by Ottoman needs and the ambitions of some hospodars, who (mindful of their fragile status) sought to pay back their creditors and increase their wealth while in a position of power. To make the reigns lucrative while raising funds to satisfy the needs of the Porte, princes channeled their energies into taxing the inhabitants into destitution. The most odious taxes (such as the \"văcărit\" first imposed by Iancu Sasul in the 1580s), mistakenly identified with the Phanariotes in modern Romanian historiography, were much older.\n\nThe mismanagement of many Phanariote rulers contrasts with the achievements and projects of others, such as Constantine Mavrocordatos (who abolished serfdom in Wallachia in 1746 and Moldavia in 1749) and Alexander Ypsilantis, who were inspired by Habsburg serf policy. Ypsilantis tried to reform legislation and impose salaries for administrative offices in an effort to halt the depletion of funds the administrators, local and Greek alike, were using for their own maintenance; it was, by then, more profitable to hold office than to own land. His \"Pravilniceasca condică\", a relatively-modern legal code, met stiff boyar resistance.\n\nThe focus of such rules was often the improvement of state structure against conservative wishes. Contemporary documents indicate that, despite the change in leadership and boyar complaints, about 80 percent of those seated in the Divan (an institution roughly equivalent to the estates of the realm) were members of local families. This made endemic the social and economic issues of previous periods, since the inner circle of boyars blocked initiatives (such as Alexander Ypsilantis') and obtained, extended and preserved tax exemptions.\n\nThe Phanariotes copied Russian and Habsburg institutions; during the mid-18th century they made noble rank dependent on state service, as Peter I of Russia did. After the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji (1774) allowed Russia to intervene on the side of Ottoman Eastern Orthodox subjects, most of the Porte's tools of political pressure became ineffective. They had to offer concessions to maintain a hold on the countries as economic and strategic assets. The treaty made any increase in tribute impossible, and between 1774 and the 1820s it plummeted from about 50,000 to 20,000 gold coins (equivalent to Austrian gold currency) in Wallachia and to 3,100 in Moldavia.\n\nImmediately afterward, Russia forcefully used its new prerogative. The deposition of Constantine Ypsilantis (in Wallachia) and Alexander Mourousis (in Moldavia) by Selim III, called on by French Empire's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Horace Sébastiani (whose fears of pro−Russian conspiracies in Bucharest were partially confirmed), was the \"casus belli\" for the 1806–1812 conflict, and Russian general Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich swiftly reinstated Ypsilantis during his military expedition to Wallachia.\n\nSuch gestures began a period of effective Russian supervision, culminating with the Organic Statute administration of the 1830s. The Danubian principalities grew in strategic importance with the Napoleonic Wars and the decline of the Ottoman Empire, as European states became interested in halting Russian southward expansion (which included the 1812 annexation of Bessarabia). New consulates in the two countries' capitals, ensuring the observation of developments in Russian−Ottoman relations, had an indirect impact on the local economy as rival diplomats began awarding protection and \"sudit\" status to merchants competing with local guilds. Nicholas I of Russia pressured Wallachia and Moldavia into granting constitutions (in 1831 and 1832, respectively) to weaken native rulers.\n\nThe boyars began a petition campaign against the princes in power; addressed to the Porte and the Habsburg Monarchy, they primarily demanded Russian supervision. Although they referred to incidents of corruption and misrule, the petitions indicate their signers' conservatism. The boyars tend to refer to (fictitious) \"capitulations\" which either principality would have signed with the Ottomans, demanding that rights guaranteed through them be restored. They viewed reform attempts by princes as illegitimate; in alternative proposals (usually in the form of constitutional projects), the boyars expressed desire for an aristocratic republic.\n\nThe active part taken by Greek princes in revolts after 1820 and the disorder provoked by the Filiki Eteria (of which the Ghica, Văcărescu and Golescu families were active members after its uprising against the Ottoman Empire in Moldavia and Tudor Vladimirescu's Wallachian uprising) led to the disappearance of promotions from the Phanar community; the Greeks were no longer trusted by the Porte. Amid tense relations between boyars and princes, Vladimirescu's revolt was primarily the result of compromise between Oltenian pandurs and the regency of boyars attempting to block the ascension of Scarlat Callimachi (the last Phanariote ruler in Bucharest). Ioan Sturdza's rule in Moldavia and Grigore IV Ghica's in Wallachia are considered the first of the new period, although the new regime abruptly ended in Russian occupation during another Russo−Turkish War and the subsequent period of Russian influence.\n\nMost Phanariotes were patrons of Greek culture, education and printing. They founded academies which attracted teachers and pupils from throughout the Orthodox commonwealth, and there was awareness of intellectual trends in Habsburg Europe. Many of the Phanariote princes were capable, farsighted rulers. As prince of Walachia in 1746 and Moldavia in 1749, Constantin Mavrocordat abolished serfdom and Alexandru Ipsilanti of Walachia (reigned 1774–1782) initiated extensive administrative and legal reforms. Ipsilanti's reign coincided with subtle shifts in economic and social life and the emergence of spiritual and intellectual aspirations which pointed to the West and reform.\n\nCondemnation of the Phanariotes is a focus of Romanian nationalism, usually integrated into a general resentment of foreigners. The tendency unifies pro− and anti−modernisation attitudes; Phanariote Greeks are painted as reactionary elements (by Communist Romania) and agents of brutal, opportunistic change (as in Mihai Eminescu's \"Scrisoarea a III-a\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

The organization has since moved to issue advocacy and mobilization of an email list self-reported at 71 million names.\n\nA lifelong Republican, Brinson grew up in Jacksonville, Florida and went to boarding school in South Carolina, where he worked on the successful gubernatorial campaign of James Burrows Edwards, the first Republican since the Reconstruction Era to hold that office. He attended Valdosta State College, where he met his wife, Pamela Bennett. After attending the Medical College of Georgia he was a resident at the University of Florida College of Medicine. He completed his gastroenterology fellowship back at the Medical College of Georgia, then moved to Alabama.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1989 Brinson was staff gastroenterologist at Maxwell Air Force Base and then went into private practice. In the late 1990s he advised governor of Alabama Fob James on health-care issues and helped found the Christian music radio network WAY-FM. He serves on the state board of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and the Board of Trustees for the University of Mobile.\n\nBrinson founded Redeem the Vote in 2003. In February 2004, Brinson attended a national religious broadcaster convention and met the marketing firm for Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, who he hired to promote the organization.\n\nBy October 2004, Redeem the Vote had enlisted 47 Contemporary Christian music groups, including Steven Curtis Chapman, Point of Grace, Jeremy Camp, FFH and Jaci Velasquez, to register young evangelicals and promote political participation. \nSponsors included Sean Hannity and Fox News, the American Tract Society, Focus on the Family, FamilyNet and the Gospel Music Association. Gov.

Huckabee had been an RTV national chairman in 2004, and the Huckabee campaign showed the most interest when a Redeem the Vote list manager, Webcasting TV, pitched their services. RTV claims to now have 71 million addresses, 25 million belonging to \"25 and 45 years old, upwardly mobile, right-of-center, conservative households.\" The campaign got over 414,000 Iowa contacts from Brinson's list, which is four times the expected participation in the Iowa caucuses.\n\n"}

According to the 1959 Purdue University yearbook, his hometown was Huntington, Indiana and he was a member of the honorary engineering societies Pi Tau Sigma, Tau Beta Pi, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He earned a bachelor's degree with honors in mechanical engineering from Purdue University in 1959 and a master's degree in teaching from Ball State University. He never married, had no children, and was estranged from his two brothers.\nAfter 23 years of working at Allied Signal Aerospace he was forced into early retirement, and began living on the streets. While living on the streets, he was always neat and clean and wore a baseball cap and small backpack, but was very reserved and lacked social skills. He did not own a car. Rita Belle, a volunteer nurse with the mission, befriended Walters for nine years and helped him find temporary housing after she learned that he slept behind a local senior center. Nevertheless, he chose to leave the housing after a short time. He used the telephone in the center's billiards room to make his investments, and he completed his own income tax forms.\n\nDuring his last years he suffered from severe diabetes and high blood pressure. He had two operations on his legs to improve his circulation, two operations on his eyes, and a quadruple bypass heart operation.

He has released 16 studio albums, with three RIAA platinum certifications and two gold certifications among them. More than 25 singles have entered Top 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts, including the number one hit \"She Don't Know She's Beautiful\" and 10 more Top 10 hits: \"Cadillac Style\", \"Anywhere but Here\", \"Haunted Heart\", \"Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer\", \"I Can't Reach Her Anymore\", \"National Working Woman's Holiday\", \"Third Rate Romance\", \"Meant to Be\", \"Vidalia\", and \"Love of My Life\".\n\nKershaw tried to enter politics, running as a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Louisiana in 2007 and 2010. In 2007 he finished third in the jungle primary, but Democrat Mitch Landrieu won strongly in the general election. In 2010 he carried more parishes than any other candidate, but placed third. He endorsed Republican Jay Dardenne, Secretary of State, for the position, who won the general election.\n\nSammy Kershaw was born in the Acadiana town of Kaplan, located in south Louisiana. He is the third cousin of singer Doug Kershaw. When he was 11, his grandfather gave him his first guitar. But his father died that year, so Sammy started to work a variety of day jobs while playing roadhouses at night to support his family. He began performing in Acadiana with Louisiana legend J.B. Pere. At the age of 12, Kershaw was playing in a variety of honky-tonks and beer joints, and when he was 14 he met George Jones, his lifelong idol. Subsequently, he opened shows for Ray Price, Merle Haggard, and George Jones while still barely into his teens. When the pressures of growing up fast took their toll in the form of a serious drug and alcohol problem, he quit his bad habits in 1988. He took a break from the music world to work as a remodeling supervisor at Wal-Mart.\n\nOne of Kershaw's demonstration tapes made its way to Mercury Records, which released his debut album \"Don't Go Near the Water\" in 1991. This album was certified platinum by the RIAA, and it produced four hit singles. The lead-off, \"Cadillac Style\", went to No. 3 in late 1991 and early 1992, followed by the title track at No. 12, \"Yard Sale\" at No. 17, and \"Anywhere but Here\" at No. 10. Kershaw was initially reluctant to release \"Cadillac Style\" because he felt that it was not suitable for his style; however, his co-producer, Buddy Cannon, convinced him to give the song a chance. Kershaw's often honky-tonk material and singing voice led to critical comparisons to George Jones, and he covered one of Jones's early singles, \"What Am I Worth\", on his debut as well.\n\nKershaw's second album, \"Haunted Heart\", followed in 1993. Its lead-off single, \"She Don't Know She's Beautiful\", became his only Number One hit, in April of that year. Following it were the title track, the Dennis Linde–penned \"Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer\", and \"I Can't Reach Her Anymore\", all of which hit the Top 10 as well. Although Kershaw had been told by others that radio audiences might not identify with the subject matter on \"Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer\", Kershaw wanted to release the song because he had an experience similar to its story line. Like his debut, \"Haunted Heart\" was a platinum album. In mid-1994, Kershaw also covered the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"I Know a Little\" on the tribute album \"Skynyrd Frynds\", which included country music covers of Skynyrd songs. Also in 1994, Kershaw contributed the song \"Fire and Rain\" to the AIDS benefit album \"Red Hot + Country\", produced by the Red Hot Organization.\n\n\"Feelin' Good Train\" was Kershaw's third album, released later in 1994. This album also produced four hits, including two consecutive No. 2's in \"National Working Woman's Holiday\" and \"Third Rate Romance\" (the latter a cover of the Amazing Rhythm Aces hit from 1975), with the No. 27 \"Southbound\" and No. 18 \"If You're Gonna Walk, I'm Gonna Crawl\" following in 1995. The album included a duet with George Jones on \"Never Bit a Bullet Like This\", which had previously been released on Jones's 1993 album \"High-Tech Redneck\". \"Feelin' Good Train\" was certified gold. It was followed by a Christmas album, \"Christmas Time's A-Comin'\", and Kershaw's first greatest-hits package, \"Greatest Hits, Volume 1\", both in 1995. The latter produced a No. 47 single in \"Your Tattoo\" (written by Kostas and Jack Tempchin), the first single of Kershaw's career not to reach the Top 40.\n\nKershaw's fourth studio album, the gold-certified \"Politics, Religion and Her\", was issued in 1996. It produced Top 10 hits in \"Meant to Be\" and \"Vidalia\", the latter of which Kershaw also considered a risky song, saying, \"If radio will play this one more than twice—so people can get the story and learn what a Vidalia onion is—it'll be a smash.\" These songs were followed by \"Fit to Be Tied Down\" and the title track, both of which hit the Top 30. Also included on \"Politics, Religion and Her\" were covers of Chuck Berry's \"Memphis, Tennessee\" and Sammy Johns' \"Chevy Van\". The same year, Kershaw briefly took ownership of a NASCAR Busch series team (now Xfinity Series).\n\n\"Labor of Love\" was issued later in 1997 as his fifth album. Unlike his previous albums, this one was predominantly composed of ballads. It produced a No. 2 in \"Love of My Life\", and although none of the other three singles (\"Matches\", \"Honky Tonk America\" and \"One Day Left to Live\") reached higher than No. 22, the album was nonetheless certified platinum. His next album, \"Maybe Not Tonight\", brought a Top 20 duet with Lorrie Morgan. \n\nKershaw stated that he enjoyed working with Morgan on the song, telling \"Country Weekly\" magazine, \"I knew our vocals would match up… Plus, we have fun together. We're friends and we have been friends for a long time.\" \"Maybe Not Tonight\" was commercially less successful than its predecessors, however, and it became the first album of Kershaw's career not to achieve an RIAA certification. Following \"Maybe Not Tonight\" were the singles \"When You Love Someone\" and \"Me and Maxine\", both of which peaked in the thirties. \"Louisiana Hot Sauce\", the final release from \"Maybe Not Tonight\", was also the first single of his career not to enter the charts.\n\nIn 2000, Kershaw released an album of cover songs, \"Covers the Hits\". This album comprised 10 cover songs that Kershaw had recorded in his career. Some of the songs on it, such as the single \"Third Rate Romance\", were previously found on Kershaw's studio albums, while others came from various tribute albums (such as \"Skynyrd Frynds\") to which he had contributed. \"Covers the Hits\" also included a rendition of Dr. Hook's \"Little Bit More\", a previously unreleased cover which Kershaw had recorded during the sessions for \"Labor of Love\".\n\nBy 2001, Kershaw and Morgan had married. The two recorded a vocal duet album in 2001 entitled \"I Finally Found Someone\" (the title track being a cover of the Bryan Adams/Barbra Streisand duet). This album was less successful commercially, with its only Top 40 hit being the No. 39 \"He Drinks Tequila\". Shortly afterward, a second 'greatest hits' package was released, and Kershaw left Mercury's roster.\n\nIn 2003, Kershaw signed to Audium Entertainment to release the album \"I Want My Money Back\". This album produced a No. 33-peaking in its title track, but the second single \"I've Never Been Anywhere\" fell short of the Top 40. The third and final single, \"Beer, Bait & Ammo\" (which failed to chart), was previously recorded and written by Kevin Fowler on his 2000 debut album of the same name, and would later be recorded by Mark Chesnutt on his 2004 album \"Savin' the Honky Tonk\".\n\nAfter Audium closed its Nashville division, Kershaw signed to Category 5 Records, then a newly established independent label, in 2006. His first release for the label and first chart single in three years, \"Tennessee Girl\", fell three spaces short of the Top 40 that year. It was the first release from his 2006 album \"Honky Tonk Boots\". The album's only other single, a cover of Mel McDaniel's Number One hit \"Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On\", failed to chart, and financial difficulties caused the label to close in 2007. In October of the same year, Kershaw divorced Morgan, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nIn 2008, Sammy Kershaw was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in honor of his career achievements and was also inducted into the Louisiana Songwriters Association Hall Of Fame in 2010.\n\nKershaw's first single in two years, \"Real People\", was released in late 2008 in the Boomerville/Big Hit label. However, the single failed to chart. His tenth studio album, \"Better Than I Used to Be\", was released on August 31, 2010.\n\nKershaw had become increasingly interested in politics. On June 13, 2007, he announced his candidacy for lieutenant governor of Louisiana in the October 20 jungle primary. The position was held by the incumbent Democrat, Mitch Landrieu. Kershaw also faced a second Republican candidate, State Representative Gary Beard of Baton Rouge, an engineer first elected to the State House in a 2001 special election. Kershaw finished second with 30 percent of the vote, but Landrieu won re-election with a majority on the first ballot.\n\nWatching his state embroiled in the Gulf Oil Spill in April 2010, Kershaw, a Lafayette resident, became the official spokesperson for Protect Our Coastline, a non-profit dedicated to providing relief to the fishermen and shrimpers affected most by the spill.\n\nOn August 28, 2010, Kershaw announced his second bid for lieutenant governor in the October 2 special election to replace Mitch Landrieu, who left office in May after being elected mayor of New Orleans. Kershaw's intraparty rivals included state Republican chair Roger F. Villere Jr. of Metairie, St. Tammany Parish president Kevin Davis of Slidell, and Secretary of State Jay Dardenne of Baton Rouge. Kershaw polled 19 percent and carried 31 of the 64 parishes (more than any other candidate). But he finished third in overall votes behind Dardenne and Democrat Caroline Fayard. Kershaw endorsed fellow Republican Dardenne in the runoff election, joining him at campaign events, and giving Dardenne a \"bear hug\" at his victory celebration.\nIn the 2011 race for lieutenant governor, Kershaw endorsed Dardenne's opponent, fellow Republican Billy Nungesser. Dardenne ultimately defeated Nungesser 53%-47%.\n\nKershaw continues touring throughout the year with his band, as well as performances with his often sold-out acoustic \"Roots and Boots\" tour, featuring himself onstage with other artists including Aaron Tippin, Joe Diffie, Pam Tillis, Darryl Worley, Colin Raye, and others. \n\nOn June 27, 2016, Kershaw performed in The Villages, Florida with a six piece band, including a steel guitar and fiddle. During the performance, Kershaw frequently made mention of not wanting to \"look back\" and instead continue to make music.\n\n\n"}

Her father David Julius Alder (born 3 April 1871) was Danish and her mother Sylvia Marie Stanley (born 12 December 1880) was English. Her first sister Karen, who later became a leading actress was born on 11 August 1901. Her second sister Sonya Patricia who married Sir James Marjoribanks was born on 20 May 1910.

{"id": "1922669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1922669", "title": "Victoria Lord", "text": "Victoria Lord\n\nVictoria Lord is a fictional character and matriarch of the Lord family on the American soap opera \"One Life to Live\".\n\nThe character was created as one of the main protagonists by series creator Agnes Nixon, and first cast to Gillian Spencer on the pilot aired July 15, 1968. Nixon later recast her with Erika Slezak, who became synonymous with the character role following a continual portrayal spanning her debut March 17, 1971 through the ABC Daytime finale January 13, 2012. Slezak reprised the role in The Online Network continuance of \"One Life to Live\" aired on Hulu, iTunes, FX Canada, and the Oprah Winfrey Network from April 29, 2013 through the final episode released August 19, 2013.\n\nThe role of Victoria is the mainstay original lead character of the serial, and her storylines focus on drudgery, love, and family troubles. One of the longest-running characters on American daytime television, Victoria weathers widowhood (three times), divorce (four times), a brain aneurysm, a near-death out-of-body experience (three times), being shot (two times), sent to jail, suffering a stroke, breast cancer, rape, a heart attack, heart disease, a heart transplant, the abduction of three of her five children as infants, the deaths of two siblings, and the death of her daughter from lupus. Most notably, she suffers recurring bouts with dissociative identity disorder throughout the show narrative.\n\nSlezak's tenure as Victoria earned the actress a reputation as a leading actor in American serials, with her portrayal becoming one of the most lauded and longest-running in American soap operas.\n\n\"One Life to Live\" series creator Agnes Nixon conceived the central role of Victoria \"Viki\" Lord inspired by her relationship with her domineering father, Harry Eckhardt, and her own married family life along the Philadelphia Main Line in Bryn Mawr. Nixon took further inspiration from lead protagonist Tracy Lord of the 1939 play \"The Philadelphia Story\", portrayed on stage and film by actress Katharine Hepburn.\n\nThe role of Victoria was originally cast to Gillian Spencer, who appeared from the July 1968 debut until 1970. Joanne Dorian replaced Spencer from October 1970 until March 16, 1971, when established theater actress Erika Slezak stepped into the role in the following day's episode. Slezak became synonymous with the character role since her first appearance in the role March 17, 1971, playing Victoria continually for 41 years until the original \"One Life\" television finale in 2012. Slezak reprised the role onscreen upon Prospect Park resumption of the serial from April 29, 2013 through the final episode released August 19, 2013.\n\nTwo other actresses portrayed Victoria while Slezak was on maternity and personal leave: Christine Jones in 1980 and 1981, and Judith Barcroft in 1987. In the summer of 2003, Slezak's real-life daughter, Amanda Davies, portrayed a teenaged Victoria in flashbacks. Leah Marie Hays played the role of a young Victoria Lord in a series of flashbacks as well.\n\nAt the death of show and character creator Agnes Nixon in 2016, Slezak eulogized that, \"When she hired me to play Viki on \"One Life To Live\", she changed my life and my career and I will forever be grateful to her.\"\n\nSlezak expressed interest for reprising portrayal of the character in a short-term guest appearance on ABC's last remaining soap opera, \"General Hospital\", in a March 2018 interview with \"Soap Opera Digest\" magazine, ahead of the 50th anniversary of the July 1968 premiere of \"One Life to Live\".\n\nAt the debut episode of \"One Life to Live\" July 15, 1968, twentysomething recent college graduate and heiress Victoria \"Viki\" Lord is described by author Martha Nochimson as \"blonde [and] ivory-complexioned... the clichéd American princess,\" personifying the \"woman on a pedestal\" archetype. The show's heroine from the outset, ingenue Victoria initially harbors a strong Electra complex and suffers a bout with multiple personalities prompted by her mother Eugenia's absence from childhood and father Victor's incessant grooming of her to eventually helm the family's communication business, Lord Enterprises. As Erika Slezak stepped into the role in 1971, head writer Nixon matured Victoria to a self-assured working woman managing fictional Llanview's predominant newspaper, \"The Banner\". An increasingly headstrong Victoria, relinquishing her primal desires to pander to Victor, marries working-class \"Banner\" editor Joe Riley, much to the patriarch's chagrin.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Victoria largely adopts a matronly role along with her capacities as well-connected town businesswoman and socialite, though she is still plagued with intermittent bouts of mental illness. The character comes to mother five of her own children onscreen (three from infancy), while providing surrogate nurture to younger siblings Tina and Todd. Since 2000s, the role has evolved to be regarded as the \"grande dame of Llanview.\" In a 2006 \"Boston\" magazine article, Slezak remarked of Victoria representing \"the very classy, very old-world money,\" with writer Michael Callahan calling the character \"the stiff-upper-lipped matriarch\" of the prominent Lord family.\n\nAmerican journalist and soap opera critic Connie Passalacqua Hayman (pen name \"Marlena De Lacroix\") briefly summed up the character role:\n\"... Slezak's 'Viki' is the consummate soap opera heroine, because she has so harrowingly and humanistically triumphed over all her life's tragedies.\"\n\nThe eldest child of domineering millionaire publisher Victor Lord (Ernest Graves), Victoria Lord, often nicknamed \"Viki,\" (originally Spencer) has little time for romance when \"One Life to Live\" begins in 1968. She clashes with reporter Joe Riley (Lee Patterson), but they soon fall in love; Victor disapproves and tries to keep them apart. Torn between pleasing her father and following her heart, Viki develops a wild alternate personality named \"Niki Smith\", who falls in love with Vinny Wolek (Antony Ponzini). Viki's illness — apparently caused by seeing her pregnant mother fall down the stairs as a child — is eventually treated, and she and Joe marry December 11, 1969. Joe is presumed dead in a car accident in 1970, and a heartbroken Viki (Slezak onward) finds comfort with fellow reporter Steve Burke (Bernie Grant) in 1971. After Steve is put on trial and exonerated for the murder of \"Banner\" secretary Marcy Wade (Francesca James), he and Viki marry in 1972. When a very-much alive Joe returns in-time for the nuptials, having survived his supposedly deadly car accident, Viki is forced to choose between two husbands. Viki initially stays married to Steve out of obligation, but ultimately divorces him in January 1974. That summer, Dr. Dorian Cramer (then Nancy Pinkerton) blames board member Viki for her suspension from Llanview Hospital, and a rivalry is born that will last decades. Viki and Joe remarry in a simple, New York City ceremony in September. In 1975, Dorian becomes the private physician to Viki's father Victor, soon eloping with him. Viki learns she has a half-brother, Tony Lord (George Reinholt), and Dorian plots to keep Victor's fortune for herself. In 1976, Victor suffers a heart attack and dies after wife Dorian denies him medication, and in his wake Dorian wreaks havoc on the Lord family. Viki and Joe have a son, Kevin Lord Riley, who is soon kidnapped by jealous Cathy Craig Lord (then Jennifer Harmon), but is later returned. In 1978, Viki takes in Tina Clayton (Andrea Evans), the sixteen-year-old daughter of college roommate and best friend Irene Manning Clayton (Kate McKeown), who is apparently dying of cancer. Shortly after Irene dies, Viki goes on trial for the murder of her nemesis Marco Dane (Gerald Anthony), but she is later exonerated following confessional testimony by Karen Wolek (Judith Light). Joe dies from a brain tumor in October 1979, and Viki gives birth to their second son, Joe Riley, Jr., in January 1980.\n\nAfter a disastrous relationship with con man Ted Clayton, who brainwashes and drugs her in an attempt to get his hands on her fortune, Viki marries newspaper editor Clint Buchanan (Clint Ritchie) in 1982; he adopts both of her sons. Echo DiSavoy (Kim Zimmer), seeking revenge on Clint for her mother's murder, seduces him in 1983 to ruin his marriage, then fakes her own death and frames him for it. Clint is later exonerated after Echo is found alive, and he and Viki reunite. Viki is shocked to discover in 1985 that her former ward Tina Clayton (Evans) is in fact her half-sister, daughter of Viki's father Victor and not Ted. Thanks to the machinations of Tina's boyfriend Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born), Viki succumbs to the pressure and Niki Smith returns. Posing as Viki, Niki divorces Clint; Viki later overcomes her illness with the realization that it had actually been triggered by her witnessing Victor and Irene in bed many years before. Clint and Viki remarry in 1986, and Viki gives birth to their daughter Jessica Buchanan in September 1986. Jessica is kidnapped shortly after birth by Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick), a disciple of Mitch Laurence; Jessica is soon returned unharmed in December, and Allison institutionalized. In 1988, Viki learns that she married and gave birth to a child in high school with high school sweetheart Roger Gordon (Larry Pine), but father Victor had her hypnotized to forget the occurrences. With Viki's memory restored in 1989, she annuls her 1960s off-screen marriage to Roger and initiates a relationship with daughter Megan Gordon (Jessica Tuck), an actress on the soap opera (within a soap opera), \"Fraternity Row\". Megan and Viki initially spar, but ultimately get past their initial conflicts and become close.\n\nIn 1990, Viki is elected mayor of Llanview, but a shooting and subsequent stroke leaves her paralyzed and in a wheelchair; Niki Smith emerges to aid a paralyzed Viki stand up and shoot Johnny Dee Hesser (Anthony Crivello) when he attacks Tina. Viki recovers and later donates a kidney to daughter Megan suffering terminal lupus, but Megan dies, leaving Viki devastated. Growing ever-distant from Clint, Viki engages an extramarital affair with Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes); she and Clint divorce in 1994, and she marries Sloan. Sloan dies soon after from Hodgkin's lymphoma, just as the existence of a second child of Victor and Irene's is revealed. Viki's stress reaches a critical point when Dorian (Robin Strasser onward) tells Viki a secret of which she thought Viki had been aware: the fact that Victor had sexually abused his daughter as a child. With this trauma being what had actually initiated Viki's dissociative identity disorder, she subsequently splinters into several personalities, one of which imprisons Dorian in a secret room below Llanfair. Dorian is eventually freed from her confinement, and Viki recovers after realizing she herself (more specifically, one of her alternate personalities) was the one who had smothered Victor to death in 1976. In 1995, reviled town outcast Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) is proven to be Victor and Irene's illegitimate son; Viki and Todd eventually become close. After a failed reconciliation attempt with Clint, Viki meets and falls in love with Ben Davidson (Mark Derwin), who is eventually revealed to be the long-lost son of Asa Buchanan (Philip Carey) and Renée Divine Buchanan (Patricia Elliott). Ben's first wife, Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), comes to town and tries in vain to keep Ben and Viki apart.\n\nViki is diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, but survives after a mastectomy and chemotherapy. She and Ben marry in November. In 2001, a girl named Natalie Balsom (Melissa Archer) makes the startling claim that she is Viki and Clint's biological daughter, which is confirmed by a DNA test. Mitch Laurence returns from the dead, divulging to Viki he drugged and raped her around the same time she and Clint conceived Jessica and had unknowingly become pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint, Natalie, and the other fathered by Mitch, Jessica (Erin Torpey). Unable to reconcile the revelation, Niki Smith emerges during the ordeal and plots to kill Ben in order to have her freedom, but when Ben is accidentally shot by Antonio Vega (Kamar de los Reyes), Viki returns. Ben is left comatose after the shooting. In 2003, Victor (William Stone Mahoney) is ostensibly revealed to be alive, claiming to have faked his death in 1976; however, shortly after he returns, Victor dies — but not before Viki and Todd confront him on ills inflicted to them in his wake. In 2004, Viki is diagnosed with heart disease and eventually needs a heart transplant. Coincidentally, a comatose Ben dies just as Viki takes a turn for the worse, and his heart is transplanted into Viki, who recovers but must face widowhood once again.\n\nIn 2007, Viki and Clint (Jerry verDorn) start dating again, but Dorian decides she wants Clint for herself and plots to break up the couple. Dorian's schemes succeed, and Clint ends things with Viki to start a new relationship with Dorian. Feeling humiliated and defeated, Viki leaves Llanview for a much-needed vacation and finds herself in Paris, Texas, where she tries to reinvent herself by waiting tables at a local diner. It is there that she meets patron Charlie Banks (Brian Kerwin), a recovering alcoholic, and the two begin seeing one another. Viki ultimately returns to Llanview once her family discovers her secret life, and Charlie's search for his estranged son Jared (John Brotherton) leads him there as well. Viki and Charlie resume their relationship, but break up when Viki discovers that Charlie had lied about the identity of his son in extenuating circumstances. In July 2008, Viki is involved in a car accident with Dorian; Viki's heart stops as a result of the crash, but Dorian manages to revive her. Reexamining her life, Viki reunites with Charlie, and they marry on August 4, 2009. Viki runs for mayor against Dorian and wins; she steps down, however, to help her family deal with the unexpected return of Mitch Laurence, who wreaks havoc on her daughters and murders Jared in the process.\n\nCharlie, devastated over his son's death, quits his sobriety and began drinking, distancing himself from Viki, choosing instead to conspire with Dorian to kill Mitch. Though Dorian tries to stop him at the last minute, Charlie ends up accidentally shooting Jessica (Bree Williamson onward), who survives. Devastated by Charlie's actions, Viki asks him for a divorce, but they eventually reconcile. Viki and Charlie's marriage is further complicated by the return of Echo DiSavoy, a woman who almost destroyed her marriage to Clint in 1983. Echo begins insinuating herself into Charlie and Viki's marriage, much to Viki's dismay. When a paternity revealed Charlie not to be the father of Rex Balsom (John-Paul Lavoisier), a devastated Charlie turns to Echo for comfort. Dorian, who had suspicions about Echo and Charlie's dealings, forged a truce with Viki to uncover Charlie's misgivings. A devastated Viki finds out about Charlie's affair and definitively asks him for a divorce. After confronting Charlie and Echo, Viki goes to court to fight for custody of grandson Ryder Ford while his mother Jessica was ill with her multiple personality. A stressed Viki suffers a bout with multiple personalities on the stand, leading the judge against giving the child to Viki but instead to her son and daughter-in-law, Joey (Tom Degnan) and Aubrey Buchanan (Terri Conn).\n\nIn summer 2011 a man with the \"original\" face of her only known living brother, Todd (Howarth), returned to Llanview claiming to be the victim of eight years of imprisonment and torture at the hands of his mother and Viki's childhood friend, a back-from-the-dead Irene Manning (Barbara Rhoades). After medical tests revealed the \"newer\" Todd (Trevor St. John) and the \"old\" Todd (Howarth) to have identical DNA, Irene appeared to reveal the \"two Todds\" to be twins. The man who resembled Walker Laurence (St. John) and who has been living as Todd since 2003 was revealed actually have been born Victor Lord, Jr., brainwashed into believing that he is Todd by Irene. Meanwhile, Viki agrees in court to put up Clint in Llanfair for house arrest after he was convicted of various crimes in Llanview. Dorian and Viki ostensibly put an end to their feud of nearly four decades when Dorian leaves town to become an acting U.S. senator. Viki continues work at \"The Banner\" when Tina returns to town for the reading of the will of recently murdered Victor, Jr. After months of rehashing old feelings and living under the same roof, Clint and Viki too admit to their unresolved feelings and agreed to give a romantic relationship one more try.\n\nAt the original finale, a prison breakout leads Allison Perkins to shoot both Clint and Viki, but only after telling the two that Jessica was in fact Clint's daughter and not the daughter of Mitch Laurence. Clint sanctioned another paternity test and, in the presence of Jessica, Viki, and Natalie, revealed Allison's claim to be true. Following all the emotional revelations and tears, Clint again declares his undying love for Viki and asks her to marry him for a third time.\n\nUpon the series resumption in April 2013, Viki accepts Clint's marriage proposal, and concurrently hires freelance journalist Jeffrey King (Corbin Bleu) to investigate the alleged congressional malfeasance of junior U.S. senator Dorian. Upon visiting niece Danielle Manning (Kelley Missal) in the hospital after overdosing on drugs and alcohol, she uncovers her brother Victor, Jr. to be alive. With her family newspaper in financial straits, \"The Banner\" focuses on growing the publication's online presence.\n\nAs of the final ABC episode, all of Victoria's six alternate personalities are integrated with her baseline psyche. At times during the series, Viki has been forced to impersonate one of them, particularly Niki and Jean. In order of their first appearance on \"One Life to Live\", they are:\n\nSeries fansite \"Llanview Labyrinth\" remarks that although Gillian Spencer's Victoria is featured at the show's outset, \"the obviousness of Viki being the show[']s unquestioned 'lead' did not smack the viewer quite as hard as it later would [with Erika Slezak's portrayal],\" with Spencer's Victoria melding into the ensemble cast. Joanne Dorian briefly stepped into the role beginning in October 1970, with a markedly less dynamic presence on the series than her predecessor.\n\nIn March 1971, \"One Life to Live\" executive producer Doris Quinlan remarked to \"After Noon TV\" magazine of Erika Slezak and her audition before herself, series creator and head writer Agnes Nixon, and director David Pressman, \"You've got to meet this girl—she's going to be a star.\"\n\nSince the introduction of Slezak as Victoria, her portrayal has become regarded as definitive to the role. Slezak's work has garnered her the acclaim of media critics and viewers alike, earning the actress comparisons between herself and contemporary film star Meryl Streep for perceived similarities in acting range, versatility, and numerous award nominations. Slezak has received nine Daytime Emmy Award nominations in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress for her portrayal of Victoria, winning in 1984, 1986, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 2005. At the finale of the show's last iteration, she held the record for most Emmy wins by an actress. She also garnered the \"Soap Opera Digest\" Award for Favorite Couple with co-star Mark Derwin (Ben Davidson) in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, in recognition for her work on \"One Life to Live\", Slezak was inducted as a member of the Silver Circle of the New York chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for over a quarter-century of \"significant contributions\" to television.\n\n"}
