He was a prominent figure of Uganda National Liberation Front/Army that helped remove Idi Amin and was involved in the power struggles that followed.\n\nP'Ojok, an ethnic Acholi, was born in Pupwonya, a rural community near Atiak trading centre in Kilak County, Amuru District.\n\nDuring the rule of Idi Amin, p'Ojok fled to Kenya, settling in Nairobi, where he became the chief engineer of the Kenyan Electricity Utility company. Together with Yonna Kanyomozi, Ephraim Kamuntu, Richard Kaijuka and other prominent Ugandans living in exile, p'Ojok founded the Save Uganda Movement (SUM), one of the anti-Idi Amin organizations that subsequently united under the banner of Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) with groups having a reciprocal aim who, together with Tanzanian armed forces, removed Idi Amin in 1979.\n\nDuring the Uganda-Tanzania War, p'Ojok was the Vice Chairman of the military coalition that composed to form the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA, the military faction of UNLF) and Tanzania People's Defence Force, which resulted in Amin's overthrow. He later became the Vice President of UNLF, which \"de facto\" ruled Uganda immediately after Idi Amin. Akena p'Ojok was chosen to become the President of Uganda after Yusuf Lule (who was President after Idi Amin) however, following The Moshi Conference, Godfrey Binaisa was instead appointed as President.\n\nWhen political parties were being formed in preparation for the 1980 General Elections, p'Ojok vied for leadership of Uganda Patriotic Movement (UPM), but Yoweri Museveni was instead chosen for the post. Akena p'Ojok then joined Uganda People's Congress (UPC), and became Member of Parliament for Gulu West Constituency, having beaten his main competitor, Anthony Ochaya of the Democratic Party. Uganda People's Congress won the elections (which were largely believed to have been rigged). Akena p'Ojok became the Minister of Power Posts and Telecommunications, and later held various positions as Cabinet Minister in the government of UPC's Milton Obote.\n\nIn 1985, Obote's government was deposed in a coup led by Tito Okello and Bazilio Olara-Okello. In 1986, in the aftermath of the chaos which followed the coup, Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army, which had been fighting against Obote's government for six years, seized power. P'Ojok declined several personal offers from Museveni to join his government and in 1987 was arrested and charged with treason for allegedly amassing weapons to overthrow the government. There is no record of his being found guilty of the charges, but he was sent to prison. In 1990 he was released by presidential pardon of Museveni, after which he left Uganda and settled in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn early 2005 a congregation of Acholi elders approached p'Ojok and asked him to represent the Acholi in Uganda People's Congress, an offer which he declined.\n\nSince the 1990s, p'Ojok has lived with his wife and children on the outskirts of London.\n\n"}

As a child, she made her screen debut in the 1982 comedy film \"Lookin' to Get Out\", acting alongside her father Jon Voight. Eleven years later she appeared in her next feature, the low-budget film \"Cyborg 2\", a commercial failure. She then starred as a teenage hacker in the 1995 science fiction thriller \"Hackers\", which went on to be a cult film despite performing poorly at the box-office. Jolie's career prospects improved with a supporting role in the made-for-television film \"George Wallace\" (1997), for which she received the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Television Film. She made her breakthrough the following year in HBO's television film \"Gia\" (1998). For her performance in the title role of fashion model Gia Carangi, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Film.\n\nJolie's first role in 1999 was in \"Pushing Tin\", a critical and commercial failure; however, her next film, \"The Bone Collector\", emerged as a commercial success. In the 1999 drama \"Girl, Interrupted\", Jolie played a sociopathic mental patient, a role which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. A role opposite Nicolas Cage in the heist film \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" (2000) proved to be her highest-grossing to that point. Jolie achieved worldwide recognition as the eponymous archaeologist in \"\" (2001), an action film based on the \"Tomb Raider\" video game series. Despite negative reviews, the film had the biggest opening weekend for a film featuring an action heroine. This was followed by roles in two box-office failures—the 2001 erotic thriller \"Original Sin\" and the 2002 romantic comedy \"Life or Something Like It\". Jolie reprised the role of Lara Croft in the sequel \"\" (2003).\n\nIn 2004, Jolie lent her voice to the animated feature \"Shark Tale\", followed by the role of an assassin in the commercially successful action comedy \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" (2005), opposite Brad Pitt. She then portrayed Mariane Pearl in the drama \"A Mighty Heart\" (2007), and lent her voice to the computer-animated film \"Kung Fu Panda\" (2008). The 2008 action thriller \"Wanted\", which saw her in a supporting role, proved to be a commercial success.

He became colonel of his regiment, and made himself known for his welcoming of the French Revolution and his affiliation with the Feuillants.\n\nA deputy to the Legislative Assembly in 1791, elected by the \"départment\" of Seine-et-Marne, he generally voted with the minority. As his views came to be considered too moderate by his colleagues, he resigned in 1792, and was soon after arrested on suspicion of being a reactionary. Madame de Staël obtained his release from Louis Pierre Manuel just before the September Massacres. He subsequently accompanied Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord on his mission to the Kingdom of Great Britain, returning to France after the execution of King Louis XVI.\n\nJaucourt took refuge in Switzerland to escape the Reign of Terror, and returned only after Napoleon Bonaparte's 18 Brumaire coup and the establishment of the French Consulate, entering the tribunate, of which he was the president for a short period.\n\nIn 1803, Jaucourt entered the French Senate, and next year, upon the establishment of the First Empire, he became attached to the household of Joseph Bonaparte. He accompanied Joseph to the Kingdom of Naples, and was created a count of the Empire by Napoleon.\n\nDuring the following years, Jaucourt distanced himself from the imperial cause, and, with the Bourbon Restoration he became Minister of State and a Peer of France. After the outcome of the Hundred Days (during which he stood by Louis XVIII), he was Naval Minister in July–September 1815, but held no further office. He devoted himself to the support of the Protestant interest in France, and tried to reduce the effects of the White Terror.\n\nA member of the upper house after the July Revolution and throughout the reign of Louis Philippe (the \"July Monarchy\"), he was driven into private life by the establishment of the Second Republic, but lived to see the 1851 coup and to rally to the government of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, dying in Paris the next year.\n\n"}
{"id": "7761667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7761667", "title": "Ceaușima", "text": "Ceaușima\n\nCeaușima () is a Romanian neologism sarcastically comparing the policies of former Communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu to the nuclear attack on Hiroshima. This portmanteau term was coined in the 1980s to describe the huge urban areas of Bucharest that Ceaușescu ordered torn down during the final few years of his tenure. Significant portions of the historic center of Bucharest were demolished to accommodate standardized apartment blocks and government buildings, including the grandiose Centrul Civic and the palatial House of the Republic.\n\nThe term has also been used to describe other actions of Ceaușescu not linked to the demolition of Bucharest, such as intense pollution in the Transylvanian city of Copșa Mică.\n\nCeaușescu considered it necessary to his program of systematization to demolish vast portions of the historic and central parts of Bucharest and replace them with giant representation buildings and high-density standardized apartment blocks. The latter was rooted in the ideology of \"edifying the multilaterally developed socialist society\" and it was considered an epitome of the Leninist formula of the \"fight between old and new\" (\"see Historical materialism\").\n\nStarted in 1974, and implemented some six years later, the program implied a comprehensive nationwide campaign of demolition, resettlement, and reconstruction. Historian Dinu C. Giurescu writes: \n\nThe urban systematization conducted by the communist regime has destroyed 29 traditional towns to 85-90% and also has heavily mutilated other 37 cities, including Bucharest.\n\nThe main target of the systematization was Bucharest.\nThe triggering event of systematization in Bucharest was the major earthquake of 1977, which predominantly struck edifices built before World War II (preceded by another major earthquake, that of November 10, 1940), while the structures dating from the communist era held out well. This was interpreted by the communist regime as a proof of its superiority over the pre-war regimes, and led to a paradigm change in its urban development policy. Up to that time, the communist regime had concentrated on the clearance and redevelopment of slums like \"Groapa Floreasca\" or \"Groapa lui Ouatu\" (1950s) as well as on new high-density urban settlements in the suburbs, such as \"Bucureștii Noi\" (1950s), \"Balta Albă\" (later \"Titan\"), \"Berceni\", \"Giurgiului\" or \"Drumul Taberei\" (1960s), while the city remained basically untouched. The impacts of the earthquake, more severe in the central city, provided both ideological and technical arguments for urban intervention in historical Bucharest.\n\nThe immediate consequences of this new urban policy were the demolition of monuments like \"Enei Church\" (founded 1611, rebuilt 1723; with murals by Gheorghe Tattarescu), the Neo-gothic \"Casa Cerchez\" or the elegant \"Baia Centrală\" public bath house and the suppression of the Authority for the National Heritage. However, the most pervasive consequence was the commitment of Ceaușescu to accomplish his earlier vision of the monumental Centrul Civic (\"civic centre\"), which would concentrate and symbolize the emblems of his power.\nThough the decision to build the new civic centre in the very heart of Bucharest was made in 1978, it took some six years for Ceaușescu to impose a wide-ranging reshaping. During that period, interventions in historical Bucharest, like rebuilding the traditional Calea Moșilor with uniform concrete apartment blocks, were still carried out respecting the pre-existing urban configuration. This can be explained by the significant opposition the project encountered from a majority of leading experts. To realize his project, Ceaușescu brought together some 400 urban planning professionals, visiting them at least once a week during the 1980s and providing what the press called \"valuable instructions\" (\"indicații prețioase\") in front of a large scale model of Bucharest.\n\nSince Ceaușescu succeeded in quelling disagreement and opposition expressed by authoritative architects, art historians and intellectuals, a coherent reshaping project never came to light. Instead, through what was largely a step-by-step approach, the implementation of Casa Republicii (\"House of the Republic\"), now \"Palatul Parlamentului\", (\"Palace of the Parliament\") could be imposed. The subsequent opening of the oversized Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism was but the consequence of architectural requirements aiming at creating a congruent perspective to the colossal House of the People. The final result was compared to both the Pyongyang of Kim Il Sung and Adolf Hitler's Germania.\n\nAfter the project had been officially finalised, the frequent interventions of Ceaușescu continued to modify the situation on the ground, leading mostly to further demolitions.\n\nThe mass destructions in Bucharest began in 1983 and continued up until late 1988. Construction was very intense during the first year, so that in June 1984 the Ceaușescus could inaugurate the workings of what would become the House of the People.\n\nThe destroyed urban areas extended over several informal districts (\"cartiere\"), some of exceptional architectural and/or historical significance. Since both the urban project and its execution were much of a trial-and-error process, demolitions were often arbitrary. However, a certain west to east pattern of demolition can be ascertained: the western area of \"Uranus\" as well as approximately 92% of the adjoining eastern area of Văcărești were destroyed, while the areas situated farther east like Dudești and Theodor Speranția were demolished only along the large boulevards which had to be created there.\n\nThe Uranus district was the foremost target of the flattening, since it had an exceptional geographic value, being situated on the most prominent height of Bucharest; this was where the House of the People was to be placed. The height on which the Uranus city district was located, called Dealul Spirii, was radically reshaped in order to make it bear the House of the People. Another height belonging to the Uranus area, of lesser dimensions, was the \"Mihai Vodă\" Hill.\n\nThe destruction of the Uranus area reached the shore of the Dâmbovița River (\"Splaiul Independenței\") on the north side, the streets \"Hașdeu\" and \"Isvor\" on the east side, \"Sabinelor\" and \"Calea Rahovei\" streets on the south side, cutting a straight line of some 1,200 meters on the north-south axis through a dense urban area along the streets \"Bateriilor\" and \"Logofătul Nestor\". Other important streets of the Uranus district were: Uranus, Mihai Vodă, Puțul cu Apă Rece, Cazărmii, Militari, Schitul Maicilor, Banul Mihalcea, Meteorilor, Minotaurului, Arionoaia. The entire demolished area covered approximately 154 hectares.\n\nThe Uranus neighbourhood is remembered for its special atmosphere; the area was both residential and monumental: many elegant houses and villas, as well as some low-density apartments blocks constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coexisted with salient historical and architectural monuments. Thus, the fortified Mihai Vodă Monastery, founded by the Wallachian prince Michael the Brave in 1589-1591, and housing the State Archives since 1866, was pulled down. Moreover, the entire \"Mihai Vodă\" Hill has been leveled to open the view on the House of the People, while the Mihai Vodă Church was moved to a new location nestled between concrete blocks of flats.\nAmong other edifices of cultural and/or historical significance torn down in the Uranus area were: the Central Military Museum, the old Arsenal, the Art deco Stadium of the Republic (1926), the Army Theatre, Casa Demetriade, the Operetta Theatre, the higher education Institute for Physical Education, the Athletes' Hospital, the Lahovary Fountain, and the \"Isvor\" open air bath. Among the churches torn down in the Uranus district were included: the Albă Postăvari Church (donated in 1568 by a Doamna Caplea), the Spirea Veche Church (founded by a doctor Spiridon Christofi in 1765), the Isvorul Tămăduirii Church (a guilds' foundation of 1794), and the Old Saint Spiridon Church (1668).\n\nThe demolition of the churches was done with the approval of the Romanian Orthodox Church leaders. For instance, in 1989, Bishop Nifon answered the questions of western reporters by claiming the churches demolished had not much historical interest and they were too close to others.\n\nRelocating churches and cutting them off from their architectural and cultural context to be reinserted into a narrowing neighbourhood is another expression of the strategy that created \"Ceaușima\". Some examples of churches that were relocated: the Saint Ilie Rahova Church (1745), the Schitul Maicilor Church (1726), the Domnița Bălașa Church (founded in 1751 by Bălașa Lambrino, daughter of Constantin Brâncoveanu), the Sfântul Ioan Nou Church (18th century) and the entire outstanding monastic complex of Antim Monastery (1713–1715). A similar type of urban intervention cut entire quarters out of their surroundings. Thus, the city area located south of the Dâmbovița between \"Podul Isvor\" and \"Piața Unirii\" and up to Antim Monastery was hedged in by a large triangle of standardized concrete blocks of flats.\n\nThe creation of the huge Boulevard of Socialism's Victory imposed additional demolitions in areas adjacent to the Uranus district. Piața Unirii was doubled in size. Excepting the Art nouveau metal structure of the Halele Unirii allegedly built by Gustave Eiffel, the most notable demolition in this area was the Brâncovenesc Hospital (\"Așezămintele Brâncovenești\" – Brâncoveanu's Foundations, founded in 1835 by Safta Brâncoveanu) – an architectural monument and one of the most venerable, most ample and best-equipped medical institutions of Bucharest and Romania.\n\nLocated eastwards of Piața Unirii, the Văcărești area definitely belonged to the old Bucharest. The demolished area was located between \"Calea Călărașilor\" on the north, the shore of the Dâmbovița on the west and south sides, and \"Mircea Vodă\" and \"Calea Văcăreștilor\" streets in the east. The architecture of the area was eclectic, bearing witness to successive cultural and historical strata, which resulted in a mixture of 18th- to 19th-century edifices (inns, stores) and more recent buildings from the early 20th century. Other significant streets of this area were: Căuzași, Olteni, Iuliu Barasch, Banul Mărăcine, Sf. Ioan Nou, Mămulari, Sfânta Vineri, Negru Vodă, Haiducul Bujor, Clucerul Udricani, Pitagora. The total area razed covered approximately 66 hectares.\n\nAmong the most notable destroyed edifices were: the Sfânta Vineri-Herasca Church (founded in 1645), Olteni Church (1696), the historical Vechea Agie (Old Police Prefecture), the Paediatrics Hospital, the Mina Minovici Forensic Institute, Al. I. Cuza College, a monumental Courthouse, the historical Town Hall of the former Blue Sector, several old inns and stores (underneath a UU-shaped commercial complex dating from the mid-19th century) and other characteristic edifices. Unlike in the Uranus area, a very few buildings could be rescued; these included two synagogues in Mămulari Street, the little Udricani Church and the neighbouring State Jewish Theatre, formerly the Barașeum Theatre, on Iuliu Barasch Street.\n\nDudești is situated eastwards of Văcărești. Before the 1980s, its boundaries ran along \"Matei Basarab\" and \"Labirint\" streets on the north, \"Popa Nan\" and \"Th. Speranța\" streets on the east side, \"Moruzi Voevod\" and \"Papazoglu\" streets in the south, \"Olteni\" and \"Mircea Vodă\" streets on the west side. The central axis of the district ran along the streets \"Calea Dudești\" and \"Avraam Goldfaden\", with other important streets being \"Traian, Nerva Traian, Bradului, and Dr. Popper\".\n\nWhile the central part of the district has been completely bulldozed to clear the way for the Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, its northern and southern sections suffered to a lesser extent. The urban texture of the district was characteristic of housing patterns of the late 19th-early 20th century, consisting of family houses set along old tree-lined streets. Neo-classical ornaments, typical for middle class residences, were more frequent in the northern zone of the neighbourhood, while more modest dwelling structures prevailed in the southern area, where lower middle classes lived. Both the Dudești and Văcărești neighbourhoods were also notable for a traditional and significant Jewish presence. The total area razed covered approximately 110 hectares.\n\nThe Theodor Speranția area was a residential area from the interwar period, mixing middle with lower class dwelling structures. As in the case of Dudești, this neighbourhood was only partially erased. The total demolished surface was of approximately 50 hectares.\n\nThe areas completely destroyed amounted to some . In fact, the destroyed urban substance was more considerable, if isolated building clusters and town spots are added, such as the partial demolition of Știrbei Vodă street. Another outstanding example is the destruction of the vast monastic complex of Văcărești (1722) and of the Pantelimon Monastery (1750). Overall, the bulldozed area was approximately five kilometres long by one kilometre wide. It was one of the largest peacetime urban destructions at the hands of humans in recorded history. The bombardments in Bucharest and the 1977 earthquake together caused only 18% of the damage produced by the demolition campaign in the 1980s. Out of the 500 hectares accounted as \"Ceaușima\", 250 hectares were urban districts of historical significance, representing some 20–25% of historic Bucharest.\n\nAmong other destroyed monuments were 27 Orthodox Christian churches (counting eight relocated churches), six synagogues and Jewish temples, and three Protestant churches.\n\n\n\n"}

The gallery first opened as a 'Separate Room' in Marie Tussaud's 1802 exhibition in London and quickly became a success as it showed historical personalities and artifacts rather than the freaks of nature popular in other waxworks of the day. It closed permanently in April 2016.\n\nThe forerunner of Tussaud's \"Chamber of Horrors\" was the \"Caverne des Grands Voleurs\" (the Cavern of the Great Thieves) which had been founded by Dr Philippe Curtius as an adjunct to his main exhibition of waxworks in Paris in 1782. Here Curtius displayed wax figures of notorious French criminals who had been executed, as well as members of the French royal family and aristocracy who had been guillotined during the Revolution.\n\nWhen Marie Tussaud moved to London in 1802 to set up her own exhibition at the Lyceum Theatre she brought some of these figures with her and set them up in a separate gallery; and when later she toured her exhibits around the country she maintained this division in her exhibition using a 'Separate Room' to display them in. The exhibits at this time included the heads of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, as well as Madame du Barry, Marat, Robespierre, Hébert, Carrier and Fouquier-Tinville in addition to models of a guillotine and the Bastille and the Egyptian mummy from Curtius' collection.\n\nIn 1835 Madame Tussaud set up a permanent exhibition in London, and here the 'Separate Room' became the 'Chamber of Horrors'. At this time her exhibits included Colonel Despard, Arthur Thistlewood, William Corder and Burke and Hare, in addition to those listed above. The name 'Chamber of Horrors' is often credited to a contributor to \"Punch\" in 1845, but Marie Tussaud appears to have originated it herself, using it in advertising as early as 1843. Visitors were charged an extra sixpence to enter the 'Separate Room'.\n\nIn 1886 the exhibits included Burke and Hare, James Bloomfield Rush, Charles Peace, William Marwood, Percy Lefroy Mapleton, Mary Ann Cotton, Israel Lipski, Franz Muller, William Palmer and Marie Manning.\n\nOther exhibits have included Colonel Despard, Arthur Thistlewood, William Corder, Florence Maybrick, Mary Pearcey, George Chapman, Hawley Harvey Crippen, Henri Landru, Buck Ruxton, Bruno Hauptmann, John Christie, John George Haigh, George Joseph Smith and Charles Manson.\n\nThis part of the exhibition was in the basement of the building and included wax heads made from the death masks of victims of the French Revolution including Marat, Robespierre, King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, who were modelled by Marie Tussaud herself at the time of their deaths or execution, and more recent figures of murderers and other notorious criminals.\n\nThe Chamber of Horrors was renovated in 1996 at a cost of $1.5 million, bringing to life the history of crime and punishment over the last 500 years and including items from Newgate Prison and featuring replicas of instruments of torture displayed amid a recording of actors' groans and screams. An innovation in recent years was to have actors in macabre make-up and costumes lurch at customers from the dark shadows and recesses of prison cells, where some cells were occupied with waxwork figures and others had the doors ajar, giving the impression that a dangerous maniac was on the loose. Historical characters displayed included Vlad the Impaler, Genghis Khan, Guy Fawkes and Adolf Hitler. For murderers of negligible fame, there was no waxwork figure of Jack the Ripper in the Chamber of Horrors, in accordance with Madame Tussaud's policy of not modelling persons whose likeness is unknown. Instead he was portrayed as a shadow. Figures of Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter were destroyed rather than being relocated to the Chamber of Horrors.\n\nVisiting the exhibit was optional and not recommended for young children or pregnant women.\n\nThe chamber closed until further notice on 11 April 2016, due to many complaints from families with young children and has since been replaced by a new attraction named the Sherlock Holmes Experience.\n\n"}

He belonged to a dynasty which originated from Majapahit on Java, and ruled from the palace (puri) of Gelgel.\n\nDalem Seganing is briefly mentioned as king in the religious texts \"Usana Bali\" and \"Rajapurana Besakih\". However, most of the surviving details of his reign come from the Babad Dalem, a chronicle from the 18th century. He was the younger son of the Gelgel ruler Dalem Baturenggong and the daughter of Dukuh Seganing. He loyally supported his elder brother, king Dalem Bekung, whose reign was beset by rebellions and abortive warfare. According to some versions he took royal powers even before the death of his incapable brother. He might have been the Balinese king who met the first Dutch visitors to the island in 1597. Dalem Seganing was assisted in his reign by two chief ministers, the brothers Kiyayi Agung and Kiyayi Ler (Lor). The latter is possibly identical with 'Kijloer', the supreme Balinese minister at the time of the 1597 visit. According to a Dutch text, \"This Kijloer is, besides the king, the uppermost of the entire Island of Bali, and no-one may come to the king in the palace as he wishes, except this Kijloer\".\n\nThe reign of Dalem Seganing was briefly troubled by a rebellion by the nobleman Pinatih, an event dated in 1605 by a Balinese text. However, the minister Kiyayi Agung was able to persuade Pinatih to lay down arms. For the rest, the chronicles praise the age of Dalem Seganing as peaceful and successful. His death is dated 1623 in a text, but it has also been suggested that he died in 1651. He had 14 sons of whom Dalem Di Made succeeded to the throne. In the late historical text \"Babad Buleleng\" (1920), the founder of the Buleleng kingdom in North Bali, Gusti Panji Sakti, is claimed to be a son of Dalem Seganing. The same paternity is claimed for Dewa Manggis I, the ancestor of the kings of Gianyar.\n\nFrom external, in particular Dutch sources, it can be seen that the Gelgel kingdom on Bali was relatively stable and powerful in the first half of the 17th century. The rulers claimed a loose suzerainty over Blambangan in East Java, Lombok, and Sumbawa. However, the warlike activities of the Makassar kingdom of South Sulawesi deprived the Gelgel ruler of his interests in Sumbawa in c. 1618-19, and jeopardized his hold on Lombok. The Dutch East Indies Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) was interested in Bali for economic and strategical reasons, as being a Hindu realm that was opposed to the Muslim Mataram kingdom on Java. Among the items coveted by the VOC were rice, cattle and slave women, and a trading post was briefly established in c. 1620. It was quickly withdrawn, though, and Balinese trade with the outside world was henceforth carried out by Dutch private traders, Chinese, and various Indonesian groups.\n\nDalem Seganing was married to a daughter of Kiyayi di Ler, minister in Gelgel; and with Gusti Luh Made, a daughter of Gusti Ketut Bebengan. He also had a number of co-wives and mistresses. The king sired 14 sons and a daughter:\n\n\n"}

He had a passion for flying and hoped to become a fighter pilot. He studied engineering at Texas A&M University, specializing in problems in developing countries, and urban planning at the University of Houston. Unable to pass his language requirements, Cuny could not go on to Officers' Candidate School, thus ending his dream of life as an officer in the military. However, he became increasingly involved in causes such as the problems of local Mexican migrant workers.\n\nCuny became an accomplished civil engineer, working on large construction projects such as a radar installation at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. At some point he became dissatisfied and decided to become a disaster relief specialist who used his training in engineering to do humanitarian work. Cuny was hired by organizations such as the United Nations and private foundations to design and carry out relief plans. Cuny was able to maintain the autonomy to devise solutions his way and became increasingly active as a policy adviser. Cuny's overriding goal was to institute a radical restructuring of the way the disaster relief system operated throughout the world.\n\nIn 1971 he founded the non-profit Intertect Relief and Reconstruction Corp. of Dallas, Texas, a relief mission technical assistance and training company. In Dallas, is where he met Jean Parker, who helped start his company and she worked with him as a disaster mitigation specialist for many years. His company became the major disaster relief agency, Interworks. Cuny also founded the Center for the Study of Societies in Crisis which became known as the Cuny Center after his death. He worked in countries such as Biafra, Guatemala, Ethiopia, Iraq, Somalia, and Croatia. At the end of his life he was working closely with George Soros' Open Society Institute, and was instrumental in the early stages of founding the International Crisis Group, which seeks to institutionalize the knowledge base of relief experts. Cuny was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1995, but disappeared before he could officially receive his award.\n\nIn April 1995, Cuny and his team of two Russian Red Cross doctors and an interpreter disappeared in Chechnya while seeking to negotiate a ceasefire.

His parents founded several companies, including Sirius Satellite Radio and United Therapeutics. He is married to Taj Rothblatt, and they have four children together. Following his graduation from high school, Rothblatt attended the University of Vermont and earned a degree in political philosophy. In addition to political activism, Rothblatt works for MIO, LLC as a property manager, and previously managed a restaurant franchise and worked as an insurance broker. Rothblatt's great grandfather Isadore Rothblatt was a union organizer and was beaten to death by anti-union thugs because of his union activities with the Leatherworker's Union of Chicago.\n\nRothblatt is an outspoken advocate for human rights. He is Black, Jewish, and comes from a LGBTQ family. In the \"Dude Looks Like a Lady\" benefit for the Women's Center of Brevard, Rothblatt dressed as Oprah Winfrey to bring attention to women's rights. In his November 2014 campaign, Rothblatt was endorsed by the National Organization for Women, the Teamsters Local Union 769, and he was a featured speaker at the South Brevard NAACP banquet dinner. Rothblatt is a Member Delegate of the Space Coast Progressive Alliance and Vice President of the Brevard Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nRothblatt is an advocate for space, public speaker on the advantageous of investing in space settlements, and President of the Florida Space Development Council, the National Space Society's local chapter. In a talk hosted by students from SEDS, at the University of Michigan, Rothblatt advocated that space exploration should not resemble the space race but should be an endeavor of international collaboration. In a congressional debate, Rothblatt stated that he believes missions to the moon, mars, and asteroids should be a priority, and under the right plan a 1,000 people could be in space within a decade. Space was such a significant part of Rothblatt's campaign \"BBC News\" ran a story covering both candidates position on space and titled it \"Florida's space race: The politicians battling over the cosmos\". Lisa Miller, from \"New York\" magazine, wrote that the first item on Rothblatt's platform is \"space.\" Rothblatt has written on various space topics including spacesteading and panspermia.\n\nRothblatt is a Pastor, Community Organizer, and member of the Board of Directors with the Terasem Movement and codirector of worldfuturist.net. Subscribers to the Terasem movement believe technology will one day make it possible to make digital copies of oneself. Peter Rothman, from \"Humanity+\", wrote that Rothblatt may be the first openly transhumanist political candidate in the United States. Rothblatt writes and speaks on transhumanist topics, such as seasteading, cryonics, religion, mind uploading, and technological discrimination.\n\nDuring the 2014 Midterm elections, Rothblatt ran as a Democratic Party candidate against incumbent Bill Posey in Florida's 8th congressional district. Rothblatt qualified for the ballot through the petition method by gathering 4,936 signatures; the minimum required was 4,834. Issues of concern to Rothblatt were technological unemployment, protecting family values, promoting education, protecting the environment, developing space, and human rights. The candidates' debates covered Obamacare, abortion, military action, environmentalism, renewable energy, same-sex marriage, and the government shutdown; and according to Posey the debates demonstrated their ideological differences. Rothblatt's belief in transhumanism and his family ties were both regularly covered by the media. Jessica Roy, from Time, reported that Rothblatt's status as a member of Terasem may be just as difficult for his campaign as being a Democrat in the Republican majority district. During a campaign event, gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist introduced Rothblatt by saying “Gabriel is the messenger that God sent.\" Other opinions of his campaign were more critical. Katie Prill, from the National Republican Congressional Committee, wrote \"his radical ideas are too extreme for Florida families.\" Posey's spokesman, George Cecala, stated that, \"It all comes down to the real issue, and that is Bill Posey is a conservative and Gabriel Rothblatt is a liberal. Posey won the election with the majority of the vote; however, Neely Tucker from the \"Washington Post\" called Rothblatt's campaign \"a respectable debut,\" and Dustin Ashley wrote his campaign \"opens the door for other transhumanists to become part of the political action.\"\n\nRothblatt was supported by SpacePAC, a Political Action Committee (PAC) founded by his parents. Under campaign finance laws, PACs are not permitted to collaborate with the candidate. Due to these restrictions, the Rothblatts were not permitted to discuss the campaign together until the election was over. The PAC drew criticism from an editorial page of the \"New York Times\" due to the family relationship between the founders of the PAC and Rothblatt's campaign. \"USA Today\" reported that Rothblatt did not know that his parents were setting up the PAC until he saw yard signs promoting his candidacy. According to William Patrick, from Watchdog.org, Posey knew of the family relationship between Rothblatt and the PAC, but Posey declined to comment. Dave Berman, from \"Florida Today\", reported that even with the support of SpacePAC, Posey's campaign had far more funds than Rothblatt's campaign. Alex Leary, from the \"Tampa Bay Times\" reported that SpacePAC was not the first PAC to be set up by a wealthy parent to support their child's campaign.\n\n"}

{"id": "12134837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12134837", "title": "Jack Pfefer", "text": "Jack Pfefer\n\nJack Pfefer (also commonly spelled as \"Pfeffer\"; December 10, 1894 - September 13, 1974) was a professional wrestling promoter during the early-to-mid 1900s. He pioneered an earlier form of sports entertainment, as he was one of the first promoters to visualize the pro wrestling business in the mold of theater. However, he developed an infamous reputation when he exposed the sport's inner secrets to the mainstream press in a spiteful attack that nearly destroyed the entire industry.\n\nJacob Pfefer was born near Warsaw, Poland on December 10, 1894. He grew up under the control of the Russian Empire; and it was during this period when the Czars issued numerous decrees against Jews, resulting in a series of pogroms that killed thousands amidst increased anti-Semitism. He therefore left as part of the era’s mass Eastern European emigration following World War I, thus escaping the Holocaust by hiding in the boiler room of a ship to the United States. He arrived in the United States in 1921 while working as the manager for a touring acting company. With a propensity for theatrical drama, Pfefer subsequently found himself interested in the budding pro wrestling industry; and by 1924, he had begun promoting a band of Eastern European heavyweights as exotic contenders to the American champions (who would always emerge victorious over the foreign challengers in the end). Over the next five years, Pfefer gradually established himself among the region’s top booking agents; and then in 1929, he eventually relocated to New York City.\n\nUpon arriving in the Big Apple, Jack Pfefer quickly aligned himself with renowned New York promoter Jack Curley, who then ranked among the most powerful men in the entire wrestling business. Following the break-up of the famed Gold Dust Trio in the late 1920s, Curley initiated an alliance with several of the East Coast’s top bookers, including Toots Mondt and Ray Fabiani; and he subsequently formed an industry “Trust” that enabled the various regions to share their elite grappling talent. Pfefer performed as the group’s main talent manager, and he was primarily responsible for scouting potential European grapplers while also overseeing the organization’s financial books. Over the next few years, the Trust rode its incredibly popular centerpiece superstar, Jim Londos, to record profits while Pfefer helped lead one of the greatest periods in New York’s rich wrestling history. Moreover, as Curley’s health began to decline, Pfefer began to position himself among the eventual heirs to the New York wrestling throne.\n\nThen in 1932, a contractual dispute caused an eventual rift between Curley and Londos; and the New York territory quickly deteriorated without its top drawing card. Pfefer therefore abandoned Curley in favor of Londos’ group in early 1933; but later that November, a peace accord was signed between Curley’s East Coast promotion and the Tom Packs/Jim Londos alliance that was dominating in the Midwest. The agreement subsequently extended the Trust’s influence throughout all of North America, with Curley, Packs, Mondt, Fabiani, Ed White, and Paul Bowser all agreeing to share the profits evenly. As a result, Jack Pfefer consequently found himself without any allies, as he was stuck on the outside looking in on the industry’s powerful new coalition. Ostracized by his fellow wrestling peers, a bitter Pfefer looked to exact revenge, and he therefore arranged an interview with Dan Parker, who was the sports editor for the New York Daily Mirror. Pfefer subsequently took the unprecedented step of revealing most of pro wrestling’s secrets and inner workings, freely admitting the sport’s “fakery” and theatrics. Although fans had long suspected that pro wrestling was worked, Pfefer had introduced a feeling of cynicism among the mainstream press that they were being used as promotional “chumps” by Curley and his associates; and in a now-famous headline, the November 19, 1934 New York Daily News covered an impending Jim Londos vs. Everett Marshall bout by proclaiming, \"Londos and Marshall meet at Garden tonight for 26th time. Score - Londos 26, Marshall 0.\"\n\nAs a result of Pfefer’s stunning admission, pro wrestling had suddenly become a laughingstock, and sportswriters no longer covered its results since it was no longer deemed to be “legitimate competition.” Furthermore, with the nation immersed in the Great Depression, pro wrestling gates plummeted in New York; and in October 1934, Ring Magazine proclaimed the end of “honest-to-goodness wrestling matches.” With the New York territory in shambles, Pfefer then began promoting light-heavyweights along with Columbus booker Al Haft and Charlie & Willie Johnson. Moreover, Pfefer again plotted against his former partners when he paid Dick Shikat to shoot on the Trust’s new champion Danno O'Mahoney; and on March 2, 1936, Shikat betrayed Curley en route to “stealing” the championship. The Trust subsequently filed an injunction against Shikat; but before the trial ever got started, Toots Mondt paid Pfefer $17,000 to double-cross Haft and his champion, Ali Baba, by maneuvering the title onto Dave Levin on April 24, 1936. Pfefer then sold Levin’s contract to Curley and Mondt in order to re-establish his industry ties; however, the Trust ultimately blew up when the other promoters refused to work alongside Pfefer, thus ending the alliance as each territory began promoting its separate titleholders.\n\nJack Pfefer never retracted his stance that wrestling was more entertainment than competition; and he therefore distinguished himself from his peers by presenting shows as a form of theater, with exaggerated storylines and bizarre performers. He was renowned for his booking of “freak” characters, most notably including the French Angel (Maurice Tillet) and the Swedish Angel (Nils Filip \"Phil\" Oloffson [1906-1974]), whom Pfefer promoted based on their hideous looks. Moreover, Pfefer initiated numerous innovations, including such novelties as feature tag team bouts and midget wrestling. He also possessed a great eye for young talent, as he was instrumental in launching the career of Buddy Rogers; and he also served as a chief promoter of women’s grappling, booking the likes of Mildred Burke and the Fabulous Moolah over several decades. It was also Pfefer who helped the legendary Sam Muchnick promote his first show in 1945; and in subsequent years, he constantly shifted his base of operations, running territories in Toledo, Nashville, Boston, and on the West Coast while solidifying his place among the industry’s top marketers. However, while working as an agent for promoter Fred Kohler in the 1960s, Pfefer was largely blamed for ruining the Chicago territory when he booked a number of sound-alike performers like “Bummy Rogers”, “Hobo Brazil,” and \"Bruno Sanmartino\", thus repelling most of the industry’s top-flight talent. Nonetheless, he continued booking matches until 1967; and then on September 13, 1974, Jack Pfefer died at age 79 while at a Massachusetts nursing home. To this day, he remains one of the sport’s most controversial figures, yet he is also acknowledged among its most imaginative promoters.\n\nPfefer was close friends with many of the wrestling personalities he worked with and had a habit of sending gifts to their families. Stu Hart took a great liking to him and asked him to be the godfather of Hart's tenth child and seventh son, Ross Hart.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "149173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=149173", "title": "Joseph Karo", "text": "Joseph Karo\n\nJoseph ben Ephraim Karo, also spelled Yosef Caro, or Qaro (1488 – March 24, 1575, 13 Nisan 5335 A.M.), was author of the last great codification of Jewish law, the \"Shulchan Aruch\", which is still authoritative for all Jews pertaining to their respective communities. To this end he is often referred to as HaMechaber () and as Maran (Aramaic: \"Our Master\").\n\nJoseph Karo was born in Toledo, Spain in 1488. In 1492, aged four years old, he was forced to flee Spain with his family and the rest of Spanish Jewry as a result of the Alhambra Decree and subsequently settled in the Kingdom of Portugal. After the expulsion of the Jews from Portugal in 1497, the Ottomans invited the Jews to settle within their empire. Karo went with his parents to Nikopolis, then a city under Ottoman rule. In Nikopol, he received his first instruction from his father, who was himself an eminent Talmudist. He married, first, Isaac Saba's daughter, and, after her death, the daughter of Hayyim Albalag, both of these men being well-known Talmudists.\n\nBetween 1520 and 1522 Karo settled at Edirne. He later settled in the city of Safed, Ottoman Galilee, where he arrived about 1535, having en route spent several years at Salonica (1533) and Istanbul.\n\nFor a short while he lived in Nikopol, but decided to make his way to the Land of Israel so that he could immerse himself in its sanctity and complete his written works. Passing through Salonica, he met the great kabbalist Joseph Taitazak. He continued his journey to the Holy Land via Egypt and eventually settled in Safed.\n\nAt Safed he met Jacob Berab and was soon appointed a member of his rabbinical court. Berab exerted great influence upon him, and Karo became an enthusiastic supporter of Berab's plans for the restitution of \"semicha\" (rabbinical ordination) which had been in abeyance for over 11 centuries. Karo was one of the first he ordained and after Berab's death, Karo tried to perpetuate the scheme by ordaining his pupil Moses Alshech, but he finally gave up his endeavors, convinced that he could not overcome the opposition to ordination. Karo also established a \"yeshiva\" where he taught Torah to over 200 students.\n\nA Yemenite Jewish traveler, Zechariah (Yaḥya) al-Dhahiri, visited Rabbi Karo's \"yeshiva\" in Safed, in \"circa\" 1567 CE and wrote of his impressions on this wise:\n\nWhen Jacob Berab died, Karo was regarded as his successor, and together with Rabbi Moshe of Trani he headed the Rabbinical Court of Safed. In fact, by this time, the Rabbinical Court of Safed had become the central rabbinical court in all of Old Yishuv (southern Ottoman Syria), and indeed of the diaspora as well. Thus there was not a single matter of national or global importance that did not come to the attention and ruling of the Safed Beth Din. Its rulings were accepted as final and conclusive, and Karo's halachic decisions and clarifications were sought by sages from every corner of the diaspora. Rabbi Joseph Karo was also visited in Safed by the great Egyptian scholars of his day, Rabbi David ibn Abi Zimra and Rabbi Yaakov Castro. He came to be regarded as the leader of the entire generation.\n\nIn a dramatic testimonial, Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz testified that in Salonica, Karo had become one of the rare individuals who merited to be instructed by a \"maggid\"—a private angelic teacher who revealed to him many kabbalistic teachings. The maggid exhorted Karo to sanctify and purify himself, and he revealed to him events that would take place in the future. In \"Shaarei Kedusha\", Rabbi Chaim Vital explains that visitation by a maggid is a form of Divine Inspiration (ruach hakodesh). The teachings of the maggid are recorded in his published work titled \"Maggid Meisharim\", although Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai notes that only about one fiftieth of the manuscript was ever published, (see Works). However, in numerous places in \"Maggid Meisharim\" it is stated that, \"I am the Mishna that speaks in your mouth,\" indicating that the Oral Torah itself (of which the Mishna is the fundamental part) spoke within him. (However, these two explanations are not necessarily contradictory—in the merit of the Mishna Karo constantly reviewed, he was worthy of an angelic teacher).\n\nThe Maggid promised him that he would have the merit of settling in the Land of Israel, and this promise was fulfilled. Another promise, that he would merit to die a martyr's death sanctifying God's Name like Rabbi Shlomo Molcho had merited, did not transpire for an unspecified reason.\n\nHis reputation during the last thirty years of his life was greater than that of almost any other rabbi since Maimonides. The Italian Azariah dei Rossi, though his views differed widely from Karo's, collected money among the rich Italian Jews for the purpose of having a work of Karo's printed; and Moses Isserles compelled the recognition of one of Karo's decisions at Kraków, although he had questions on the ruling.\n\nWhen some members of the community of Carpentras, France, believed themselves to have been unjustly treated by the majority in a matter relating to taxes, they appealed to Karo, whose letter was sufficient to restore to them their rights (Rev. Etudes Juives 18:133–136). In the East, Karo's authority was, if possible, even greater. His name heads the decree of excommunication directed against Daud, Joseph Nasi's agent; and it was Karo who condemned Dei Rossi's \"Me'or Enayim\" to be burned. Several funeral orations delivered on that occasion have been preserved (Moses Albelda, \"Darash Mosheh\"; Samuel Katzenellenbogen, \"Derashot\"), as well as some elegies from Karo's passing.\n\nKaro published during his lifetime:\n\nAfter his death there appeared:\n\nKaro also left a commentary upon the Mishnah, as well as supercommentaries to Rashi's and Nahmanides' commentaries on the Torah, which have not been preserved.\n\nKaro's literary works are considered among the masterpieces of rabbinic literature. The \"Maggid Meisharim\" (1646, \"Preacher of Righteousness\"), another major work, a strange and mystical diary, is a kind of diary in which Karo during a period of fifty years recorded the nocturnal visits of an angelic being, his heavenly mentor, the personified Mishna (the authoritative collection of Jewish Oral Law). His visitor spurred him to acts of righteousness and even asceticism, exhorted him to study the Kabbala, and reproved him for moral laxities.\n\nThe discussions treat of various subjects. The maggid enjoins Karo to be modest in the extreme, to say his prayers with the utmost devotion, to be gentle and patient always. Especial stress is laid on asceticism; and Karo is often severely rebuked for taking more than one glass of wine, or for eating meat. Whenever Karo did not follow the severe instructions of his maggid, he suddenly heard its warning voice. His mentor also advised him in family affairs, told him what reputation he enjoyed in heaven, and praised or criticized his decisions in religious questions. Karo received new ideas from his maggid in regard to the Kabbala only; such information was in the nature of sundry cabalistic interpretations of the Pentateuch, that in content, though not in form, remind one of the theories of Karo's pupil, Moses ben Jacob Cordovero.\n\nThe present form of the \"Maggid Meisharim\" shows plainly that it was never intended for publication, being merely a collection of stray notes; nor does Karo's son Judah mention the book among his father's works (Introduction to the Responsa). It is known, on the other hand, that during Karo's lifetime the kabalists believed his Maggid to be actually existent (compare Vital-Calabrese, \"Sefer ha-Gilgulim\", pp. 119, 142, Vilna, 1885). The \"Maggid Meisharim\", furthermore, shows a knowledge of Karo's public and private life that no one could have possessed after his death; and the fact that the maggid promises things to its favorite that were never fulfilled—e.g., a martyr's death—proves that it is not the work of a forger, composed for Karo's glorification.\n\nHowever, according to Shlomo ben Aderet's responsa 548 it would seem the book was forged.\n\n"}

At the age of 19 he joined AS Cannes in the Championnat National, quickly breaking into the first team and featuring mostly as a winger.\n\nGhilas established himself as a starter in the 2004–05 season, going on to lead the team in scoring by netting seven times in 31 appearances. The following year he contributed with 13 as the French Riviera club narrowly missed out on promotion to Ligue 2, finishing two points behind FC Libourne-Saint-Seurin for the third and final spot.\n\nGhilas signed for Vitória S.C. from Portugal in the summer of 2006, penning a two-year contract. In his first year he ranked first in goals scored in his team, helping to a return to the Primeira Liga after one year out.\n\nGhilas made his debut in the competition on 19 August 2007, starting in a 1–1 home draw against Vitória de Setúbal. He scored six times in a further 20 league appearances to help the side finish a best-ever third and qualify to the UEFA Champions League; however, following a contract dispute, he left the Minho Province club as a free agent.\n\nOn 12 July 2008, Celta de Vigo announced the signing of Ghilas from Vitória, with the player penning a three-year contract worth €300,000 a year. He scored his first goals for the Galicians on 28 September in a 2–1 home win over CD Tenerife, in what was the season's first win.\n\nOn 28 July 2009, a fee of £1.7 million was agreed for Ghilas to transfer to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League – the move was set to be completed pending on the player agreeing personal terms and passing a medical. However, the transfer broke down in the 11th hour, with conflicting reports on the grounds: the English claimed he had failed the medical, whereas the Spaniards claimed that Blackburn had attempted to renegotiate the transfer fee and player's wages at the last minute; they attempted to disprove Rovers' claims by playing him in a friendly the following day.\n\nOn 13 August 2009, Ghilas agreed terms with Hull City, signing a four-year deal for which Celta was paid roughly £2 million. He made his debut for his new team nine days later, scoring in a 1–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers in the 61st minute after being fed a through ball from Jozy Altidore.\n\nHowever, Ghilas failed to perform for the East Yorkshire side subsequently, being loaned to French clubs AC Arles-Avignon and Stade de Reims. He made his debut for the latter on 15 August 2011, netting in a 2–1 win over AS Monaco FC.\n\nAfter scoring 14 goals in the 2011–12 campaign, being an essential offensive unit as Reims returned to Ligue 1 after more than three decades, Ghilas joined the club on a permanent deal. On 30 January 2014 he moved teams and countries again, joining Belgian Pro League's R. Charleroi S.C. for six months.\n\nAlthough French-born, Ghilas opted to represent Algeria, making his international debut on 2 June 2007 in an 2008 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Cape Verde. Five months later he scored his first goal, in a 3–2 friendly win over Mali.\n\nGhilas' younger brother, Nabil, was also a footballer and a forward. He too played in France, Portugal and for Algeria.\n\n"}

Steven gets him to say \"dada\" and records a video. Lauren sends it to Peter, which upsets Steven as he sees himself as Louie's father, but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. When Jane discovers Steven has been stealing money from the restaurant, he explains he borrowed it to pay Peter's debts as he is drinking heavily and getting into fights, and Lauren does not know the whole truth. When Lauren learns this, she is angry that he was not honest and considers visiting Peter. Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake, so she decides not to go. Lauren starts to worry that her relationship with Steven has become stale but she does manage to seduce him until they are interrupted. While visiting Max at work, Lauren meets Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre) and they share an attraction. Lauren insists on meeting up with him to see what happens.

Lauren reaches the final two for the job and Max asks Josh not to employ Lauren, and he makes sure someone else gets the job, however, Josh visits Lauren at home and offers her a different job, and he meets Steven and realises Lauren is in a relationship and has a child. Thanks to Abi, Steven becomes paranoid about Lauren and Josh's relationship and starts tracking Lauren's whereabouts via a mobile app. Lauren finds out she is pregnant, and books an appointment to discuss an abortion, soon after revealing her intentions to Abi, as she is not ready to have a second child. Max tells a disbelieving Lauren that Josh is engaged, then Josh admits he is getting married in November. Lauren surprises and annoys Abi by arranging a secret Father's Day visit from Oscar for Max, neglecting to tell Abi about it. However, this drives Abi to reveal the abortion to Steven, though he decides not to confront Lauren. Lauren tells Josh that she loves Steven but admits that there are no \"fireworks\", and tells Josh that she will not cheat on him, unaware that Steven has been spying on her with a secret camera. Unaware that Abi and Steven have embarked on an affair, Lauren realises she does not love Steven and plans on returning to New Zealand to make amends with Peter. However, Steven learns about her plans and lies to her that he has an inoperable brain tumour. Lauren is wracked with guilt and decides to remain in Walford. In another desperate attempt to keep her, Steven spontaneously proposes to her in the Queen Vic, which she accepts. Lauren then resigns from Weyland & Co and starts planning her and Steven's wedding, however, after a fire which he started at Ian's restaurant, he dies. Lauren is devastated. Abi tries to tell her that she is pregnant with Steven's baby but Lauren misinterprets it as gloating about her own abortion, so Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven's love, causing Lauren to start drinking again. On the day of Steven's funeral, Lauren finds out he lied about having a brain tumour and destroys his wreaths. When she finds out that Steven has been cremated, she refuses to scatter his ashes. Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya and when Lauren learns of this, she asks if she and Louie can join her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together; unbeknownst to Lauren, Abi is secretly taking Steven's ashes with her.\n\nLauren returns and moves back in with Ian and asks Josh for her job back. Josh accepts and flirts with Lauren but she rejects him again, but after numerous attempts, Lauren eventually gives into temptation and kisses Josh. When Josh's former fiancee, Imogen (Alexandra Sinclair) arrives unexpectedly at the office, she belittles Lauren and tells her that Josh dislikes children. To confirm this, Lauren asks Josh if he would like to spend time with her and Louie; he reluctantly accepts, but implies that they should go as a couple instead which displeases Lauren. Josh later tries to declare his love for he and asks why they cannot be together; she explains that they are different people and that she is a recovering alcoholic. Ian's mother Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) advises Lauren to move on from Steven and pursue Josh, which she does and they start a relationship. Lauren discovers Weyland & Co's Project Dagmar, a plan to develop Albert Square into luxury apartments, and photographs a scale model. She threatens to publicise the project but her boss James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), who is also Josh's father, convinces Lauren that the project has fallen through due to investors dropping out at the last minute and she deletes the photo. Josh confirms this, having only just heard about the project. However, it emerges that this was a lie and that Weyland & Co have bought several properties in Albert Square and are evicting business owners. Lauren refuses to give an eviction notice to Ian, so is fired. She discovers that Max is involved in the plan to con the residents. James destroys Max's contract, revealing that he has also been manipulated, but Josh gives Lauren a copy as he is entitled to his share. Lauren asks Max for the truth or she will destroy the copy, but he destroys it himself, saying that he knew about Abi's affair with Steven and her pregnancy and that his plan was to exact revenge on those who abandoned him. Later, Josh tells Lauren that he can stop the development by revealing that James bribes members of Walford Council. Josh asks Lauren to stall James and Fi at a press launch so he can get evidence of the bribes, so she chains herself to their property, but is arrested for breach of the peace. Lauren is cautioned and released, and then kisses Josh when he says he has left Weyland, though his plan has failed. Josh is offered a new job in Glasgow and Lauren agrees to move there with him. Ian disapproves of her relationship with Josh when he catches them kissing which causes Lauren to slap Ian, but Kathy convinces him that Josh is not like his father. On Christmas Day, Max gives Lauren a thoughtful Christmas present and she tells him that he needs medical help. Tanya returns to take Lauren and Abi away from Walford, revealing that Max killed Steven and tried to kill Jane. Lauren and Abi reject Max. Max goes to the roof of the Vic where he plans to kill himself by jumping off, but Lauren and Abi climb on to the ledge to try and stop him. As Max agrees to come down, Lauren slips and she and Abi both fall off. They are taken to hospital, where Lauren has surgery on her pelvis, which is fractured, and Abi has a CT scan and is declared brain-stem dead. When Lauren starts physiotherapy, she becomes frustrated with not being told the truth about Abi and breaks down when she sees her. Lauren slaps Max for lying to her about Abi's condition and is devastated by Abi's death. Lauren is distraught when Abi's life support is withdrawn.\n\nBefore Abi's funeral, Lauren lies to Max that it has already taken place because Tanya does not want him there, however, he realises it is a lie. On the day of the funeral, Lauren tells Whitney about her planned move to Scotland with Josh and Whitney asks her to be sure that she actually loves him or if she is only with him because he is good with Louie. After the service, she sees Max going into the chapel and tells him that she needs to leave, before hugging him and crying. Lauren then takes Louie from Josh and walks away without him. Cora later reveals that Lauren has moved to New Zealand, possibly reuniting with Peter.\n\n Lauren is described by the BBC website as an \"outsider\" and \"doesn't care what people think\". It continues: \"Lauren is very quick on the uptake and picks up on everything going on around her but knows it doesn't pay to have loose lips. She's learnt the hard way that secrets destroy people. And this has made her vulnerable.\"\n\nLauren Branning was introduced in 2006 by executive producer Kate Harwood. She and her immediate family—father Max (Jake Wood), mother Tanya (Jo Joyner) and sister Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald)—are an extension of the popular and long-running Jackson/Branning clan, who have appeared in the series since 1993. It was announced in May 2006 that Lauren would be played by actress Madeline Duggan. Duggan was replaced by Jacqueline Jossa, with Duggan's final scenes airing on 23 June 2010.\n\nOn 9 May 2010 it was announced that Duggan had been axed from the soap by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and that she had already filmed her exit scenes. Her final episode was broadcast on 23 June 2010. In August 2010, it was announced that the character would be returning later in the year, now played by Jacqueline Jossa. Of her casting in the show, Jossa said \"I was so excited when I got the call to say I'd got the part in \"EastEnders\". I've always been a massive fan of the show and it's a dream come true. The character of Lauren Branning will be really fun to play and there are some exciting things coming up\". Kirkwood said \"I'm delighted to welcome Jacqueline Jossa to Albert Square. Jacqueline's portrayal of Lauren has all the classic Branning qualities of toughness, cynicism and sensitivity. Jacqueline is set to be at the heart of Walford drama for some time to come\". It was reported that Lauren's return would show a more grown-up side to the character, who will cause trouble but also show a softer side as she attempts to find love.\n\nJossa's first appearance was on 27 September 2010. Jossa said that when she first got the part of Lauren, she \"worried unnecessarily\". Talking to \"PA\", Jossa said that working with Joyner and Wood was not as scary as she thought. She commented: \"There was less pressure than I thought there was going to be. When I first started I got really scared and worked up, thinking everyone's going to hate me. They've been there four years and then I'm coming in to be their daughter - it was a bit surreal. And then two weeks later I felt completely comfortable, everyone was cracking jokes and I thought, 'Oh... I built it up a bit!'\"\n\nLauren's primary storylines concerned a school girl romance with Peter Beale (Thomas Law), a friendship with the delinquent Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), and being caught in the middle of her warring parents, who separated in the serial in 2007 when Tanya discovered Max was cheating on her with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), Lauren's half brother Bradley's wife. In the storyline, Lauren played an integral part in the discovery of the affair; as a result of a practical joke, Lauren unwittingly recorded Max and Stacey kissing on video camera, and sent the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present in December 2007 as means of revenge on her father. Despite a change of heart, the recording was seen by the entire Branning family on Christmas Day, an episode that drew 13.9 million viewers, 55.3% of the total audience share.\n\nThe character became involved in one of \"EastEnders\"' most controversial storylines in 2008, when she was groomed by a paedophile, Tony King (Chris Coghill). Tony King had been introduced in September 2008 as the fiancé of Lauren's cousin Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). However, in a plot twist, it was revealed that Tony was already in a sexual relationship with Bianca's 15-year-old stepdaughter Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty). After losing interest in Whitney, Tony turns his attentions to 14-year-old Lauren. An insider said: \"He has got away with abusing Whitney for years but it seems one young girl isn't enough.\"\n\nIn April 2011, it was announced that Lauren is to have a relationship with already established character, Ryan Malloy. An \"EastEnders\" insider commented: \"Sparks will fly when Ryan and Lauren begin their relationship. Max is certainly someone not to mess with. He's already very protective of his daughters and Ryan isn't exactly his favourite person after his relationship with Stacey, who Max will always hold a torch for.\"\n\nJossa explained that upon Lauren finding out about Tanya's cancer, viewers see a different side to Lauren. She told \"Inside Soap\": \"Immediately, there's a change in her - with Tanya so sick, Lauren has to grow up. You'd expect her to dive into the drink again or something like that, but she's right there for Tanya from the minute she finds out what's going on.\" She continues: \"Tanya is still convinced she'll be fine, but then she finds out that the cancer has begun to spread. Tanya's really vulnerable at that point and it's Lauren who's saying, 'We're going to fix this and everything will be fine'. She's there for her mum the whole time - shopping, cooking, cleaning, looking after Abi and Oscar. She really wants to help Tanya and actually enjoys the responsibility.\"\n\nIn January 2012, Jossa praised her storyline in which Lauren starts binge drinking due to the stress of her mother suffering from cancer. Jossa commented on the storyline saying that teenagers should take binge drinking more seriously. She said: \"It's good \"EastEnders\" have done the storyline. It highlights that teenagers who people label irresponsible could be doing it to deal with worries they are keeping to themselves. What they actually need is help or someone to talk to. At first to Lauren drinking was a laugh. Then it became a way of forgetting - she has carried the burden of keeping her mum's illness secret.\" Speaking about Lauren's love life, Jossa added: \"I always want Lauren and Fatboy to get together. They would make such a cute couple.\"\n\nJossa predicted in November 2012 that Lauren will revert to her old ways after her latest relationship break-up. When asked if Lauren would start drinking again, Jossa said that Lauren did not really stop and that alcohol is her \"comfort blanket\". Executive Producer Lorraine Newman said that Lauren's binge drinking will \"come to a head\" in Spring 2013. Newman commented \"Lauren's obviously very troubled. A huge amount of what we're seeing now is to do with what's been going on with her parents for such a long time. It's a tough one covering the issue of binge drinking because inevitably, in order for it to have sufficient impact, it has to go on for a considerable amount of time. There's a real danger that it will become unpalatable and that you won't have too much empathy for the character.\" Newman also added that the binge drinking storyline will come to a conclusion in 2013.\n\nIn March 2013, it was revealed that Lauren is to have her drink spiked by her friend Lucy Beale. Lauren gave up her binge drinking to save her relationship with Joey but Lucy cannot stand seeing them happy together and decides she wants Joey back after a brief fling. Lucy spikes Lauren's drink and Lauren becomes extremely drunk and makes a fool of herself. Joey dumps Lauren as he thinks she has drinking behind her back and Lauren's life spirals out of control. An insider told the \"Daily Star\" \"It's going to be emotional to watch Lauren go through it all again as she's already been through so many battles with the bottle.\" Hetti Bywater said that she will continue her scheming until she gets Joey back.\n\nIn September 2012, Alison Rowley of \"Digital Spy\" said that Lauren will fall in love with her cousin Joey Branning (David Witts). An \"EastEnders\" insider told the \"Daily Star\" that it will be a huge storyline across the autumn. The insider said \"Lauren hits the booze and shows her vulnerable side to Joey. He's there for her and feels very protective. The more time they spend together the more they start to realise their feelings for each other are not just that of cousins.\" As the chemistry between the pair intensifies, they try to hide the relationship from their parents. The insider said that it is a powerful force and that the attraction between them is so strong that it will take something huge to \"stop them jumping into bed\". Daniel Kilkelly later revealed that Lauren and Joey will be in a \"horrifying\" car crash. Filming for scenes begun on 10 September and is thought that the on-location filming will continue through the week. The details of the storyline are being kept under wraps but the \"Daily Mail\" reports that Lauren will joyride her uncle Derek Branning's (Jamie Foreman) car but it goes horribly wrong and their lives are left hanging in the balance when Lauren loses control of the car and goes through a shop window. An insider commented \"Everyone is really excited about these scenes. It's going to be a huge storyline for us in a few weeks' time, so it's definitely one for the fans to watch out for.\" The storyline will reportedly air in November 2012 and is said to be one of the show's biggest moments of the year.\n\nLauren is later dumped by Joey after Derek blackmails him. Witts said that Joey will find life \"really hard\" after dumping Lauren. Derek suggests to Joey that if he tells the police that he was driving the car that drunken Lauren crashed, she can avoid a prison sentence. Joey agrees to the deception to help Lauren but is later horrified when Derek threatens to tell the police the truth unless he gets his own way. Speaking to \"Soaplife\", Witts said \"Joey must either move in with Derek and be a respectful and loving son, or dump Lauren. If Joey takes either of those options, Derek won't tell the police that Lauren was driving the car. Joey's love for Lauren is massive, but not quite as massive as his hatred for Derek. He decides to become the villain and lie that he never loved her. He'll take the flack because that will make it easier for her to move on without him.\" Witts also added that it will be \"really hard\" as he keeps making out to Lauren that he is not interested. Witts also said that Joey would be making a mistake if he told Lauren about Derek's blackmail. He commented \"She's very headstrong and she'd say that she doesn't care about getting into trouble with the law. It would all end in tears. Everyone would find out as Lauren's the sort of person who'd blurt everything out, and it would cause even more of a mess. Joey very much thinks he's doing the right thing.\" Tony Discipline said that he does not mind watching Jossa's, his real-life girlfriend's scenes and that he supports the Joey and Lauren plot commenting \"I don't find it strange to watch - it is part of the job. We always support each other and Jacqueline always asks me how it looks. But it is part of our job.\"\n\nOn 10 September 2017, it was announced that Jossa had been axed from the show by executive consultant John Yorke, along with Lorna Fitzgerald. An official spokesperson said: \"We can confirm Jacqueline and Lorna will be leaving. They have been wonderful to work with and we wish them all the best for the future.\" Their exit story started airing during the Christmas period of 2017. Jossa's departure aired on 16 February 2018.\n\nFollowing Jossa's first appearance, Lauren started appearing in her own internet spin-off series, \"Lauren's Diaries\", and a second series started in 2011.\n\n\"Inside Soap\" commented on Lauren's recasting describing Lauren played by Duggan was \"a pretty lass, but pretty unimpressive\" and that played by Jossa she has acquired \"an attitude as severe as her fringe\". Jane Simon from the \"Daily Mirror\" said that Lauren played by Jossa \"brings some badly needed oomph to the part\". Jossa won Best Newcomer at the National Television Awards 2012. Executive Producer Bryan Kirkwood commented: \"I'd like to say a huge congratulations to our girl, Jacqueline Jossa, for her amazing success. It's well-deserved recognition of Jacqueline's beautiful, truthful and moving portrayal of Lauren Branning.\" A writer for the \"Daily Mirror\" said that all of Lauren's problems are caused by her being a Branning. In August 2017, Jossa was longlisted for Sexiest Female at the Inside Soap Awards, while Steven's brain tumour lie to Lauren was longlisted for Best Shock Twist. Jossa's Sexiest Female nomination made the viewer-voted shortlist, but she lost out to Natalie J. Robb, who portrays Moira Dingle in \"Emmerdale\". The scene in which Lauren and Abi fall from the roof of The Queen Vic was awarded \"Scene of the Year\" at the 2018 British Soap Awards, tying with \"Doctors\" who also won the same award for \"The Bollywood Proposal\".\n\n\n"}

His father died when he was only three years old. He started his career in the company he founded together with his mother in 1889, which produced photographic paper according to traditional methods. In 1894, he founded the company Gevaert & Co, which in 1920, was transformed to N.V Gevaert Photo-producten, merged in 1964 with Agfa AG to become Gevaert-Agfa NV and later Agfa-Gevaert NV.\n\nAlready at an early age, he felt socially responsible and wanted to advance the status of Dutch in Belgium. His personal ideas were strongly influenced by the social encyclical \"Rerum novarum\" (1891) and the writings of Lodewijk De Raet. He supported several Flemish initiatives as a manager, but stayed outside politics. His main objectives were the introduction of Dutch as a business language, and the foundation of a sound Dutch-speaking education as a means to establish a Flemish elite. In 1926, when the \"Vlaamsch Handelsverbond\" (Vlaams Economisch Verbond, VEV) was founded, Gevaert was its first chairman.

{"id": "7335368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7335368", "title": "Lil' Chris", "text": "Lil' Chris\n\nChristopher James Hardman (26 August 1990 – 23 March 2015), known by the stage name Lil' Chris, was an English singer-songwriter, actor, and television personality. He came to prominence in 2006 after appearing on the Channel 4 series \"Rock School\", which saw KISS vocalist and bassist Gene Simmons make a rock band at Lil' Chris' school. Later that year he released the single \"Checkin' It Out\", which charted at number 3, and a self-titled album. In 2008 he hosted his own series, \"Everybody Loves Lil' Chris\". He took his own life in March 2015 at his home in Lowestoft after a period of depression.\n\nHardman was born in Lowestoft, Suffolk, the son of Ian Hardman, a slaughterhouse worker, and Karen Elizabeth Hardman (née Clarke), a supermarket worker. He had an older sister, Hannah, and a younger brother, Nathan.\n\nHe gained the nickname 'Lil' Chris' because his height was 4'11\" at age 15. He was the shortest boy in his year at Kirkley High School.\n\nHardman rose to prominence in January 2006 at the age of 15 after appearing in series two of Channel 4's \"Rock School\". The show saw Gene Simmons (from the band KISS) try to form a rock band out of a class of children attending Kirkley High School (now East Point Academy). In the series, Hardman was immediately seen as a contender for the band after revealing that he could sing, play guitar, drum and write songs. Eventually Hardman was selected as frontman and lead singer in the line-up for the group (now named \"Hoax UK\" after the slogan on Hardman's cap). In the final episode the group went on to open for Judas Priest, Rob Zombie and Anthrax at a concert in Long Beach, California.\n\nA week after the performance, Hardman was contacted by record producers Ray Hedges and Nigel Butler, who appeared in \"Rock School\" to help the class with songwriting. Hardman went on to sign a record contract with RCA Records and released his debut single \"Checkin' It Out\" in September 2006 which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. After performing a cover of Justin Timberlake's \"SexyBack\" on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, Hardman then released his debut album \"Lil' Chris\" in December 2006. On 14 October 2006 he appeared in the Big Gig at Wembley Arena before 20,000 Girl Guides. He continued to promote and release singles from his album throughout 2007, as well as performing as a supporting act for McFly on their 24 date \"Up Close and Personal\" tour throughout the UK. Hardman also took part in BBC Three's \"Celebrity Scissorhands\" and made guest appearances in episodes of CBBC's \"SMart\" and \"TMi\". He also appeared on the \"Weakest Link\" in 2007 but refused to sing in front of Anne Robinson when asked by the hostess. He was voted off in round 5.\n\nMore television work followed in 2008, including appearances on \"Hider in the House\", \"Dani's House\" and \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\". Hardman also compered the 4Music stage of the T4 on the Beach music festival in July 2008. In October and November 2008 (after a successful pilot earlier in the year) he hosted \"Everybody Loves Lil' Chris\" on the T4 strand of Channel 4 on Saturday mornings. The show was a mixture of celebrity interviews, live music performances and various 'challenges' that he undertook. The airing of the show coincided with the release of Hardman's second album \"What's It All About\" in October 2008. He also supported Alphabeat on their \"Wolfbaggin\"' tour, throughout the UK.\n\nThroughout 2009, Hardman made celebrity appearances as a DJ, visiting various venues around the UK. These included Zanzibar Club in Leicester in May 2009, and Tramps Nightclub in Worcester in August 2009. In October 2009 Hardman made a guest appearance on the BBC1 game show \"Hole in the Wall\", and also featured in an episode of the second series of the CBBC comedy show \"Sorry, I've Got No Head\". During December 2009 to January 2010, he presented the making of \"Remo Skilla's\" music video, \"Stoosh\", which was posted on YouTube.\n\nFrom 18 June to 14 July 2012, Hardman starred in \"\" at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds in the role of Francis Weir. The musical transferred to the Garrick Theatre in London's West End from October 2012 to January 2013, with understudy Ashley Luke Lloyd playing the role of Francis Weir for the majority of the London run due to the indisposition of Hardman. After \"Loserville\" closed Hardman briefly worked for Anglian Home Improvements, selling their products door to door in Lowestoft. In October 2013, he announced via Twitter that he was working on a new album, his first since 2008. Hardman issued a new single for Christmas 2013 called \"Christmas Number One (#FeedEmYellowSnow)\" with Lloyd Wilkinson, and set off on a Christmas tour with Tom Mann and Giles Potter, from 2013's \"The X Factor\". The tour was called The Lil' Chris-tmas tour. On 3 December 2013, the Official Chart Company listed \"Christmas Number One (#FeedEmYellowSnow)\" as a contender for the Christmas Number One spot on 22 December 2013, but the single failed to chart.\n\nIn 2014 Hardman launched MAML, his own alternative clothing label incorporating his own designs. The range was available for several months online and from a store in Hardman's home town of Lowestoft. He continued to write new material with producer Guy Barnes, which he hoped would be released in the summer of 2014, but by this time Hardman had no management or record label or distribution in place, so it was planned to release his summer anthem 'Louder' with other songs on an EP in 2015.\n\nIn April 2014 he tweeted: \"I hope to one day create a way out of depression that doesn't mean taking your own life. The Cure.\" In October 2014 he tweeted, \"Depression really sucks. Learning how to notice it can save lives and your own feelings at times. Take time to understand it, for everybody.\"\nOn 3 March 2015 Hardman tweeted, \"Thinking about quitting music forever...there has to come a time eventually when I have to face reality. I'm just not good enough.\" Hardman died on 23 March 2015 at his Lowestoft home at the age of 24. His friend found him not breathing and called 999. Paramedics were called to his home, but they were unable to revive him and they declared him dead at the scene. Suffolk Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious. Tributes were given by people such as boxer Anthony Ogogo, who had attended the same school, and Gene Simmons. On 29 April 2015, It was reported that the cause of death was suicide by hanging. A statement issued by his family on 30 March 2015 paid tribute to him:\n\"Chris was a huge personality who will be missed by everyone who knew him. He was a hugely creative person who used this side of his personality to make others smile, to cheer people up, and to make others feel better. If he wasn’t bringing joy through music he was telling jokes or pulling pranks. He was the sunshine on a rainy day, and could make friends the minute he walked into a room, making everyone smile with his gorgeous, cheeky face.\n\nA real people person, he would always take the time to stop and talk, no matter who or when, and we are proud that he was so well thought of by all who knew him. So many commented on what a lovely, well brought up person he was, so polite and kind and a pleasure to know.\n\nChris had struggled with mental health issues and depression in recent years. He was committed to helping others find better ways of overcoming this illness and publicly said he wished to find a cure. Despite this, his concern was always his family and his friends, whose happiness was his priority.\"\nHardman’s memorial service was held in Gorleston, near his home town of Lowestoft, on 8 April 2015 and was a private event for family and friends only; this short service consisted of speeches without hymns. Later that day a private funeral was held in Lowestoft. Those attending, which included James Bourne from McBusted, were asked to wear green, which was his favourite colour, while others were invited to wear green to remember him. Following the funeral family and friends released green balloons at the Claremont Pier in Lowestoft.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After finishing school at Austin College, he taught music at the University of Alabama. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as the chair of the music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse; together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while, and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology.\n\nAfter Applewhite's release, he traveled to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers that they would be visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.\n\nThe group received an influx of funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to their faith in the narrative that he constructed.\n\nMarshall Herff Applewhite Jr. was born in Spur, Texas, on May 17, 1931, to Marshall Herff Applewhite Sr. (1901–1971) and his wife Louise (née Winfield; 1901–1988). He had three siblings. The son of a Presbyterian minister, Applewhite became very religious as a child.\n\nApplewhite attended Corpus Christi High School and Austin College; at the latter school, he was active in several student organizations and was moderately religious. He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1952 and subsequently enrolled at Union Presbyterian Seminary to study theology, hoping to become a minister. He married Anne Pearce around that time, and they later had two children. Early in his seminary studies, he decided to leave the school to pursue a career in music, becoming the music director of a Presbyterian church in North Carolina. He was a baritone singer and enjoyed spirituals and the music of Handel. In 1954, he was drafted by the United States Army and served in Austria and New Mexico as a member of the Army Signal Corps. He left the military in 1956 and enrolled at the University of Colorado, where he earned a master's degree in music and focused on musical theater.\n\nApplewhite moved to New York City in an unsuccessful attempt to launch a professional singing career upon finishing his education in Colorado. He then taught at the University of Alabama. He lost his position there after pursuing a sexual relationship with a male student; his religious education was likely not supportive of same-sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires. He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later.\n\nAfter leaving the University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to Houston, Texas, in 1965 to teach at the University of St. Thomas. His students regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser. He served as chair of the music department; he also became a locally popular singer, serving as the choral director of an Episcopal church and performing with the Houston Grand Opera. In Texas, he was briefly openly gay but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family, greatly upsetting him. He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems. Robert Balch and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite and a student. The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized near the end of his employment.\n\nIn 1971, Applewhite briefly moved to New Mexico, where he operated a delicatessen. He was popular with customers but decided to return to Texas later that year. His father died around that time; the loss took a significant emotional toll on him, causing severe depression. His debts mounted, forcing him to borrow money from friends.\n\nIn 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an interest in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known her for a long time and concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.\n\nApplewhite soon began to live with Nettles. Although they cohabited, their relationship was not a sexual one, fulfilling his longtime wish to have a deep and loving, yet platonic, relationship. She was married with two children, but after she became close with Applewhite, her husband divorced her, and she lost custody of her children. Applewhite permanently broke off contact with his family as well. He saw Nettles as his soulmate, and some of his acquaintances later recalled that she had a strong influence on him. Raine writes that Nettles \"was responsible for reinforcing his emerging delusional beliefs\", but psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton speculates that Nettles' influence helped him avoid further psychological deterioration.\n\nApplewhite and Nettles opened a bookstore known as the Christian Arts Center, which carried books from a variety of spiritual backgrounds. They also launched a venture known as Know Place to teach classes on mysticism and theosophy. They closed these businesses a short time later. In February 1973, they resolved to travel to teach others about their beliefs and drove throughout the Southwest and Western U.S; Lifton describes their travels as a \"restless, intense, often confused, peripatetic spiritual journey\". While traveling, they had little money and occasionally resorted to selling their blood or working odd jobs for much-needed funds. They subsisted solely on bread rolls at times, often camped out, and sometimes did not pay their lodging bills. One of their friends from Houston corresponded with them and agreed to accept their teachings. They visited her in May 1974, and she became their first convert.\n\nWhile traveling, Applewhite and Nettles pondered the life of St. Francis of Assisi and read works by authors including Helena Blavatsky, R. D. Laing, and Richard Bach. They kept a King James Version of the Bible with them and studied several passages from the New Testament, focusing on teachings about Christology, asceticism, and eschatology. Applewhite also read science fiction, including works by Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke. By June 1974, Applewhite and Nettles' beliefs had solidified into a basic outline. They concluded that they had been chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies, and that they had been given higher-level minds than other people. They wrote a pamphlet that described Jesus' reincarnation as a Texan, a thinly veiled reference to Applewhite. Furthermore, they concluded that they were the two witnesses described in the Book of Revelation and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities, often referring to themselves as \"The Two\", or \"The UFO Two\". They believed that they would be killed and then restored to life and, in view of others, transported onto a spaceship. This event, which they referred to as \"the Demonstration\", was to prove their claims. To their dismay, these ideas were poorly received.\n\nIn August 1974, Applewhite was arrested in Harlingen, Texas, for failing to return a car that he had rented in Missouri. He was extradited to St. Louis and jailed for six months. At the time, he maintained that he had been \"divinely authorized\" to keep the car. While jailed, he pondered theology and subsequently abandoned discussion of occult topics, in favor of extraterrestrials and evolution.\n\nAfter Applewhite's release, he and Nettles resolved to contact extraterrestrials and they sought like-minded followers. They published advertisements for meetings, where they recruited disciples, whom they called \"crew\". At the events, they purported to represent beings from another planet, the Next Level, who sought participants for an experiment. They claimed that those who agreed to take part in the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level. He and Nettles referred to themselves as \"Guinea\" and \"Pig\". Applewhite described his role as a \"lab instructor\" and served as the primary speaker, while Nettles occasionally interjected clarifying remarks or corrections. The two seldom personally spoke with attendees, only taking phone numbers with which they could contact them. They initially named their organization the Anonymous Sexaholics Celibate Church, but it soon became known as the Human Individual Metamorphosis.\n\nApplewhite believed in the ancient astronaut hypothesis, which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in the past and placed humans on Earth and would return to collect a select few. Parts of this teaching bear similarities to the Reformed Christian concept of election, likely owing to Applewhite's Presbyterian upbringing. He often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from \"Star Trek\" and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show.\n\nApplewhite and Nettles sent advertisements to groups in California and were invited to speak to New Age devotees there in April 1975. At this meeting, they persuaded about half of the 50 attendees to follow them. They also focused on college campuses, speaking at Cañada College in August. At a meeting in Oregon in September 1975, they saw further recruitment success—about 30 people left their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets. The coverage was negative: commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of brainwashing against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.\n\nBenjamin E. Zeller, an academic who studies new religions, notes that Applewhite and Nettles' teachings focused on salvation through individual growth and sees this as similar to currents in the era's New Age movement. Likewise, the importance of personal choice was also emphasized. Applewhite and Nettles denied connection with the New Age movement, viewing it as a human creation. Janja Lalich, a sociologist who studies cults, attributes their recruitment success to their eclectic mix of beliefs and the way that they deviate from typical New Age teachings: discussing literal spaceships while retaining familiar language. Most of their disciples were young and interested in occultism or otherwise lived outside of mainstream society. They came from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Eastern religions and Scientology. Most were well versed in New Age teachings, allowing Applewhite and Nettles to convert them easily. Applewhite thought that his followers would reach a higher level of being, changing like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly; this example was used in almost all of their early literature. Applewhite contended that this would be a \"biological change into a different species, casting his teachings as scientific truth in line with secular naturalism.\" He emphasized to his early followers that he was not speaking metaphorically, often using the words \"biology\" and \"chemistry\" in his statements. By the mid-1970s, he attempted to avoid the use of the term \"religion\", seeing it as inferior to science. Although he dismissed religion as unscientific, he sometimes emphasized the need for faith in the aliens' abilities to transform them.\n\nBy 1975, Applewhite and Nettles had taken the names \"Bo\" and \"Peep\". They had about 70 followers and saw themselves as shepherds tending a flock. Applewhite believed that complete separation from Earthly desires was a prerequisite of ascension to the Next Level and emphasized passages in the New Testament in which Jesus spoke about forsaking worldly attachments. Members were consequently instructed to renounce: friends, family, media, drugs, alcohol, jewelry, facial hair, and sexuality. Furthermore, they were required to adopt biblical names. Applewhite and Nettles soon told them to adopt two-syllable names that ended in \"ody\" and had three consonants in the first syllable, such as Rkkody, Jmmody, and Lvvody; Applewhite stated that these names emphasized that his followers were spiritual children. Applewhite, Nettles, and their followers lived what religious scholar James Lewis describes as a \"quasi-nomadic lifestyle\". They usually stayed at remote campgrounds and did not speak about their beliefs. Applewhite and Nettles ceased having public meetings in April 1975, and spent little time teaching doctrine to their converts. The leaders also had little contact with their dispersed followers, many of whom renounced their allegiance.\n\nApplewhite and Nettles feared that they would be assassinated, and taught their followers that their deaths would be similar to those of the two witnesses of the Book of Revelation. Balch and Taylor believe that Applewhite's prison experience and early rejection by audiences contributed to this fear. Applewhite and Nettles later explained to their followers that the former's treatment by the press was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy. Applewhite took a materialistic view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. He drew heavily from the Book of Revelation, although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity. He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.\n\nBy early 1976, Applewhite and Nettles had settled on the names \"Do\" and \"Ti\"; Applewhite stated that these were meaningless names. In June 1976, they gathered their remaining followers at Medicine Bow National Forest in Southeastern Wyoming, promising a UFO visit. Nettles later announced that the visit had been cancelled. Applewhite and Nettles then split their followers into small groups, which they referred to as \"Star Clusters\".\n\nFrom 1976 to 1979, the group lived in campgrounds, usually in the Rocky Mountains or Texas. Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers' heretofore loosely structured lives, which improved membership retention. They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants. Increasingly, they emphasized that they were the only source of truth—the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms. Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination. Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as \"flexibility\": strict obedience to their often shifting requests. The two leaders limited the group's contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them. Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission—their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders. Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision. To his followers, he did not seem dictatorial: many of them found him laid back and fatherly. In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the \"fine art of religious entertainment\", noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service. Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers; he referred to these tasks as \"games\". He also watched science-fiction television programs with the rest of the group. Rather than issue direct commands, he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice. He emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose, in what Lalich dubs the \"illusion of choice\".\n\nIn the late 1970s, the group received a large sum of money, possibly an inheritance of a member or donations of followers' income. This capital was used to rent houses, initially in Denver and later in Dallas. Applewhite and Nettles had about 40 followers then and lived in two or three houses: the leaders usually had their own house. The group was secretive about their lifestyle, covering their windows. Applewhite and Nettles arranged their followers' lifestyles as a boot camp that would prepare them for the Next Level. Referring to their house as a \"craft\", they regimented the lives of their disciples to the minute. Students who were not committed to this lifestyle were encouraged to leave; departing members were given financial assistance. Lifton states that Applewhite wanted \"quality over quantity\" in his followers, although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts.\n\nApplewhite and Nettles sometimes made sudden, drastic changes to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as a way that they increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.\n\nIn 1980, Applewhite and Nettles had about 80 followers, many of whom held jobs, often working with computers or as car mechanics. In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call their families. They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on Mother's Day. They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying computers at a monastery. These vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.\n\nIn 1983, Nettles had an eye surgically removed as a result of cancer diagnosed several years earlier. She lived for two more years, dying in 1985. Applewhite told their followers that she had \"traveled to the Next Level\" because she had \"too much energy to remain on Earth\", abandoning her body to make the journey. His attempt to explain her death in the terms of the group's doctrine was successful, preventing the departure of all but one member. Applewhite became very depressed. He claimed that Nettles still communicated with him, but he suffered from a crisis of faith. His students supported him during this time, greatly encouraging him. He then organized a ceremony in which he symbolically married his followers; Lalich views this as an attempt to ensure unity. Applewhite told his followers that he had been left behind by Nettles because he still had more to learn—he felt that she occupied \"a higher spiritual role\" than he did. He began identifying her as \"the Father\" and often referred to her with male pronouns.\n\nApplewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as he needed the guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured that there would be no possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.\n\nAfter Nettles' death, Applewhite also altered his view of ascension: previously, he had taught that the group would physically ascend from the Earth and that death caused reincarnation, but her death—which left behind an unchanged, corporeal body—forced him to say that the ascension could be spiritual. He then concluded that her spirit had traveled to a spaceship and received a new body and that he and his followers would do the same. In his view, the Biblical heaven was actually a planet on which highly evolved beings dwelt, and physical bodies were required to ascend there. Applewhite believed that once they reached the Next Level, they would facilitate evolution on other planets. He emphasized that Jesus, whom he believed was an extraterrestrial, came to Earth, was killed, and bodily rose from the dead before being transported onto a spaceship. According to Applewhite's doctrine, Jesus was a gateway to heaven but had found humanity unready to ascend when he first came to the Earth. Applewhite then decided that there was an opportunity for humans to reach the Next Level \"every two millennia\", and the early 1990s would therefore provide the first opportunity to reach the Kingdom of Heaven since the time of Jesus. Zeller notes that his beliefs were based on the Christian Bible but were interpreted through the lens of belief in alien contact with humanity.\n\nApplewhite taught that he was a walk-in, a concept that had gained popularity in the New Age movement during the late 1970s. Walk-ins were said to be higher beings who took control of adult bodies to teach humanity. This concept informed Applewhite's view of resurrection: he believed that his group's souls were to be transported to a spaceship, where they would enter other bodies. Applewhite abandoned the metaphor of a butterfly in favor of describing the body as a mere container, a vehicle that souls could enter and exit. This dualism may have been the product of the Christology that Applewhite learned as a young man; Lewis writes that the group's teachings had \"Christian elements [that] were basically grafted on to a New Age matrix\". In a profile of the group for \"Newsweek\", Kenneth Woodward compares his dualism to that of ancient Christian Gnosticism, although Peters notes that his theology departs from Gnosticism by privileging the physical world.\n\nIn the wake of Nettles' death, Applewhite became increasingly paranoid, fearing a conspiracy against his group. One member who joined in the mid-1980s recalled that Applewhite avoided new converts, worrying that they were infiltrators. He feared a government raid on their home and spoke highly of the Jewish defenders of Masada in ancient Israel who showed total resistance to the Roman Empire. Increasingly, he began to discuss the Apocalypse, comparing the Earth to an overgrown garden that was to be recycled or rebooted and humanity to a failed experiment. In accordance with the garden metaphor, he stated that the Earth would be \"spaded under\". Woodward notes that Applewhite's teaching about the Earth's recycling is similar to the cyclical perspective of time found in Buddhism. Applewhite also utilized New Age concepts, but he differed from that movement by predicting that apocalyptic, rather than utopian, changes would soon occur on Earth. He contended that most humans had been brainwashed by Lucifer, but that his followers could break free of this control. He specifically cited sexual urges as the work of Lucifer. In addition, he stated that there were evil extraterrestrials, whom he referred to as \"Luciferians\", who sought to thwart his mission. He argued that many prominent moral teachers and advocates of political correctness were actually Luciferians. This theme emerged in 1988, possibly in response to the lurid alien abduction stories that were proliferating at the time.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the group kept a low profile; few people knew it still existed. In 1988, they mailed a document that detailed their beliefs to a variety of New Age organizations. The mailing contained information about their history and advised people to read several books, which primarily focused on Christian history and UFOs. With the exception of the 1988 document, Applewhite's group remained inconspicuous until 1992, when they recorded a 12-part video series which was broadcast via satellite. This series echoed many of the teachings of the 1988 update, although it introduced a \"universal mind\" of which its hearers could partake.\n\nOver the course of the group's existence, several hundred people joined and left. In the early 1990s, their membership dwindled, numbering as few as 26; these defections gave Applewhite a sense of urgency. In May 1993, the group took the name \"Total Overcomers Anonymous\". They then spent $30,000 to publish a full-page advertisement in \"USA Today\" that warned of catastrophic judgment to befall the Earth. Its publication led about 20 former members to rejoin the group. This, along with a series of public lectures in 1994, caused membership to double from its nadir at the beginning of the decade. By this time, Applewhite did not regiment his disciples' lives as strictly as he had and spent less time with them.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Applewhite posted some of his teachings on the Internet, but he was stung by the resulting criticism. That year, he first spoke of the possibility of suicide as a way to reach the Next Level. He explained that everything \"human\" had to be forsaken, including the human body, before one could ascend. The organization was then renamed \"Heaven's Gate\". Davis speculates that this rejection may have encouraged him to attempt to leave Earth.\n\nFrom June to October 1995, the group lived in a rural part of New Mexico. They purchased and built a compound—which they referred to as the \"Earth ship\"—using tires and lumber; Applewhite hoped to establish a monastery. This proved to be a difficult endeavor, particularly for the aging Applewhite: he was in poor health and, at one point, feared that he had cancer. Lifton notes that Applewhite's active leadership of the group probably led to severe fatigue in his last years. The winter was very cold, and they abandoned the plan. Afterwards, they lived in several houses in the San Diego area.\n\nThe group increasingly focused on the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration. They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in Mexico. In Applewhite's view, sexuality was one of the most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no reproductive organs but that Luciferian beings had genders. He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.\n\nIn October 1996, the group rented a mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, California. That year, they recorded two video messages in which they offered their viewers a \"last chance to evacuate Earth\". Around the same time, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp. Applewhite now believed that Nettles was aboard a spaceship trailing the comet, and that she planned to rendezvous with them. He told his followers that the vessel would transport them to an empyrean destination, and that there was a government conspiracy to suppress word of the craft. In addition, he stated that his deceased followers would be taken by the vessel as well, a belief that resembled the Christian pretribulation rapture doctrine. It is not known how he learned of the comet or why he believed that it was accompanied by extraterrestrials or why he should have believed the dead Nettles would be with them.\n\nIn late March 1997, the group isolated themselves and recorded farewell statements. Many members praised Applewhite in their final messages; Davis describes their remarks as \"regurgitations of Do's gospel\". Applewhite recorded a video shortly before his death, in which he termed the suicides the \"final exit\" of the group and remarked, \"We do in all honesty hate this world\". Lewis speculates that Applewhite settled on suicide because he had said that the group would ascend during his lifetime and thus appointing a successor was unfeasible.\n\nReligious scholar Catherine Wessinger posits that the suicides began on March 22. Most members took barbiturates and alcohol and then placed bags over their heads. They wore Nike shoes and black uniforms with patches that read \"Heaven's Gate Away Team\". A bag that contained a few dollars and a form of identification was placed beside most bodies. The deaths occurred over three days; Applewhite was one of the last four to die. Three assistants helped him commit suicide, then killed themselves. An anonymous tip led the sheriff's department to search the mansion; they found 39 bodies there on March 26. It was the largest group suicide involving U.S. citizens since the 1978 mass suicide of 920 Americans in Jonestown, Guyana. Applewhite's body was found seated on the bed of the mansion's master bedroom. Medical examiners determined that his fears of cancer had been unfounded, but that he suffered from coronary atherosclerosis.\n\nThe deaths provoked a media circus, and Applewhite's face was featured on the covers of \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\" on April 7. His final message was widely broadcast; Hugh Urban of Ohio State University describes his appearance in the video as \"wild-eyed [and] rather alarming\".\n\nAlthough many popular commentators, including psychologist Margaret Singer, speculate that Applewhite brainwashed his followers, many academics have rejected the \"brainwashing\" label as an oversimplification that does not express the nuances of the process by which the followers were influenced. Lalich speculates that they were willing to follow Applewhite in suicide because they had become totally dependent upon him, and hence were poorly suited for life in his absence. Davis attributes Applewhite's success in convincing his followers to commit suicide to two factors: he isolated them socially and cultivated an attitude of complete religious obedience in them. Applewhite's students had made a long-term commitment to him, and Balch and Taylor infer that this is why his interpretations of events appeared coherent to them. Most of the dead had been members for about 20 years, although there were a few recent converts.\n\nLewis argues that Applewhite effectively controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing that members of the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw it as a way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.\n\nUrban writes that Applewhite's life displays \"the intense ambivalence and alienation shared by many individuals lost in late twentieth-century capitalist society\". He notes that Applewhite's condemnations of contemporary culture bear similarities to those of Jean Baudrillard at times, particularly their shared nihilist views. Urban posits that Applewhite found no way other than suicide to escape the society that surrounded him and states that death offered him a way to escape its \"endless circle of seduction and consumption\".\n\nWhile covering the suicides, several media outlets focused on Applewhite's sexuality; the \"New York Post\" dubbed him \"the Gay Guru\". Gay rights activist Troy Perry argued that Applewhite's repression, and society's rejection, of same-sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide. This idea has failed to gain support among academics. Zeller argues that Applewhite's sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism, which he believes resulted from a variety of factors, though he grants sexuality a role.\n\nLalich states that Applewhite fit \"the traditional view of a charismatic leader\", and Evan Thomas deems him a \"master manipulator\". Lifton compares Applewhite to Shoko Asahara, the founder of Aum Shinrikyo, describing him as \"equally controlling, his paranoia and megalomania gentler yet ever present\". Christopher Partridge of Lancaster University states that Applewhite and Nettles were similar to John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton, who founded Muggletonianism, a millennialist movement in 17th century England.\n\n\nBooks\nJournals\nMagazines\nNewspapers\n"}
{"id": "695675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=695675", "title": "Matronymic", "text": "Matronymic\n\nA matronymic is a personal name based on the given name of one's mother, grandmother, or any female ancestor. It is the female equivalent of a patronymic. Around the world, matronymic surnames are far less common than patronymic surnames. In some cultures in the past, matronymic last names were often given to children of unwed mothers. Or if a woman was especially well known or powerful, her descendants might adopt a matronym based on her name.\n\nThe word \"matronymic\" is first attested in English in 1794 and originates in the Greek μήτηρ \"mētēr\" \"mother\" ( μητρός \"mētros\" whence the combining form μητρo- \"mētro\"-), ὄνυμα \"onyma\", a variant form of ὄνομα \"onoma\" \"name\", and the suffix -ικός -\"ikos\", which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense \"pertaining to\" (thus \"pertaining to the mother's name\"). The Greek word μητρωνυμικός \"mētrōnymikos\" was then borrowed into Latin in a partially Latinised form (Greek \"mētēr\", dialectally \"mātēr\", corresponds to Latin \"mater\"), as \"matronomicus\". These words were a source for coining the English \"matronymic\" as the female counterpart to \"patronymic\" (first attested in English in 1612). Whereas the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" records an English noun \"patronym\" in free variation with the noun \"patronymic\", it does not, however, record a corresponding noun \"matronym\".\n\nMore rarely, English speakers use forms based wholly on Greek: the noun \"metronym\" (first attested in 1904); and the noun and adjective \"metronymic\" (first attested in 1868). These are, for example, the forms used in the 2016 \"The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland\".\n\nThe matrilineal communities in South and North-East India, like the Bunts and Khasi, have family names which are inherited from their mother. Matronymic names are common in Kerala. Daughters take the names of their mothers as the second part of their name.\n\nThe Minangkabau of Indonesia are the largest group of people who use this naming system. People of Enggano Island also use a matronymic system. They also have family name/surname (marga).\n\nFilipino names legally have the maiden name of the child's mother as a middle name as opposed to Anglo-American use of secondary or tertiary given names. Filipino children born to unwed mothers, if not claimed by the father nor adopted by anyone else, automatically bear their mother's maiden name and sometimes middle name.\n\nSome Vietnamese names also function this way, as less of a \"tradition\" than a style or trend, in which the mother's maiden name is the child's middle name.\n\nAlthough many English matronyms were given to children of unwed mothers, it was not unusual for children of married women to also use a matronymic surname. For instance, it was traditional during the Middle Ages for children whose fathers died before their births to use a matronym, and it was not unheard of for children to be given a matronym if the father's name was foreign, difficult to pronounce, or had an unfortunate meaning. A child of a strong-minded woman might also take a matronym, as might a child whose name would otherwise be confused with that of a cousin or neighbour. There are even instances where royal houses used matronymics to strengthen claims to the English throne – for example, Princess Matilda's eldest son was known as Henry FitzEmpress (-fitz meaning \"son of\" from Latin \"filius\"). Common English matronyms include Beaton, Custer, Tiffany, Parnell, Hilliard, Marriott, Ibbetson, Babbs, and Megson.\n\nIn the old Finnish system, women were standardly given matronyms, while men were given patronyms, for example, Ainontytär (female) or Pekanpoika (male). Since the 19th century the system of inherited family names has been used, however, and today nearly all Finns have inherited surnames.\n\nFamily names derived from matronyms are found in France, especially in Normandy: Catherine, Marie, Jeanne, Adeline. In medieval Normandy (Duchy of Normandy), a matronym might be used when the mother was of greater prominence than the father or the basis for a claim of inheritance, such as in the cases of Henry FitzEmpress and Robert FitzWimarc.\n\nSome Icelandic people, like Heiðar Helguson, have matronyms.\n\nMatronymics appear in medieval Celtic tales such as \"Cath Maige Tuired\" and the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi (the children of Dôn).\n\nMatronymics are accepted in the Netherlands but are generally written as given names on identity cards.\n\nFamily names derived from matronyms are also found in Romania, especially in the region of Moldavia. Examples include: Aioanei, Ababei, Acatrinei, Ailincăi.\n\nFamily names derived from matronyms are also found in Russia. Examples include: Katin, Mashkov, Annushkin. Oleg Yaroslavich, 12th century prince of Galich, was known as Oleg Nastasyich during his life to distinguish his claim from that of his half-brother Vladimir.\n\nAn example of an Arabic matronymic is the name of Jesus in the Qur'an, ‘Īsá ibn Maryam, which means Jesus the son of Mary. The book \"Kitāb man nusiba ilá ummihi min al-shu‘arā’\" (The book of poets who are named with the lineage of their mothers) by the 9th-century author Muḥammad ibn Ḥabīb is a study of the matronymics of Arabic poets. There exist other examples of matronymics in historical Arabic.\nMost characters in the Bible are referred to with a patronymic. However, Abishai, Joab, and Asahel – the sons of Zeruiah, sister or stepsister of King David – are invariably referred to as \"Sons of Zeruiah\" and the name of their father remains unknown. Also the Biblical Judge Shamgar is referred to with the matronymic \"Son of Anat\".\n\nThere are indications of a Jewish history of matronymic names. Specifically, in East European Jewish society, there appeared various matronymic family names such as Rivlin (from Rivka/Rebecca), Sorkin (from Sarah), Zeitlin (from Zeitl), Rochlin (from Rachel), Feiglin (from Feige), and others. In certain Jewish prayers and blessings, matronyms are used, e.g., \"Joseph \"ben\" (son of) Miriam\".\n\n"}

Farrow has appeared in more than 50 films and won numerous awards, including a Golden Globe Award and three BAFTA Award nominations. Farrow is also known for her extensive work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, which includes humanitarian activities in Darfur, Chad, and the Central African Republic. In 2008, \"Time\" magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.\n\nThe daughter of Australian director John Farrow and Irish actress Maureen O'Sullivan, Farrow had a strict Catholic upbringing in Beverly Hills, California. After working as a fashion model during her teenage years, she first gained notice for her role as Allison MacKenzie in the television soap opera \"Peyton Place\" and gained further recognition for her subsequent short-lived marriage to Frank Sinatra, whom she married at age 22. An early film role, as Rosemary in Roman Polanski's \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968), saw her nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. She went on to appear in several films throughout the 1970s, such as \"Follow Me!\" (1972), \"The Great Gatsby\" (1974), and \"Death on the Nile\" (1978). \n\nFarrow was in a relationship with actor-director Woody Allen from 1980 to 1992 and appeared in thirteen of his fourteen films over that period, including \"Zelig\" (1983), \"Broadway Danny Rose\" (1984), \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" (1985), \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986), \"Radio Days\" (1987), \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" (1989), \"Alice\" (1990), and \"Husbands and Wives\" (1992). Her later film roles include \"Widows' Peak\" (1994), \"The Omen\" (2006), \"Be Kind Rewind\" (2008), \"Dark Horse\" (2011), and Luc Besson's \"Arthur\" series (2006–2010).\n\nMaría de Lourdes Villiers Farrow was born February 9, 1945 in Los Angeles, California, the third child and eldest daughter of Australian film director John Farrow and Irish actress Maureen O'Sullivan. Her father converted to her mother's Catholic religion. She is one of seven children, with older brothers Michael Damien (1939–1958), Patrick (1942–2009), younger brother John Charles (born 1946); and younger sisters Prudence and actresses Stephanie and Tisa.\n\nHer eldest brother, Michael Farrow, died in a plane crash in 1958, at age 19; Patrick, a sculptor, committed suicide in 2009; and John Charles was convicted of sexually abusing two young boys in 2013 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Her sister Prudence inspired John Lennon to write the song \"Dear Prudence\".\n\nFarrow grew up primarily in Beverly Hills, California, where she occasionally put on performances with \"toy daggers and fake blood\" for passing celebrity tour buses. Aged two, she made her film debut in a short documentary, \"Unusual Occupations: Film Tot Holiday\" (1947). She was raised as a Roman Catholic, and received her primary and high school education at a Catholic convent by nuns. When she was nine, she contracted polio during an outbreak in Los Angeles reportedly affecting 500 people. She was placed in an isolation ward for three weeks and later said the experience \"marked the end of [her] childhood\". After the 1959 death of Farrow's brother, Michael, she and her family relocated to Surrey, England; her father began drinking heavily during this period, which caused strain on his marriage to her mother. He died of a heart attack in Los Angeles four years later, when Farrow was 17 years old.\n\nBefore her acting career, Farrow worked as a fashion model for many years. She screen-tested for the role of Liesl von Trapp in \"The Sound of Music\", but did not get the part. The footage has been preserved, and appears on the fortieth Anniversary Edition DVD of \"The Sound of Music\". Farrow began her acting career by appearing in supporting roles in several 1960s films, making her first credited appearance in \"Guns at Batasi\" (1964). The same year, she achieved stardom on the popular primetime soap opera \"Peyton Place\" as naive, waif-like Allison MacKenzie. Farrow left the series in 1966 at the urging of Frank Sinatra whom she married on July 19, 1966.\n\nFarrow's first leading film role was in \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968), which was a critical and commercial success at the time and continues to be widely regarded as a classic of the horror genre. Her performance garnered numerous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress, and established her as a leading actress. Film critic and author Stephen Farber described her performance as having an \"electrifying impact... one of the rare instances of actor and character achieving a miraculous, almost mythical match\". Film critic Roger Ebert called the film \"brilliant\", and noted, \"A great deal of the credit for this achievement must go to Mia Farrow, as Rosemary\".\nFollowing \"Rosemary's Baby\", Farrow was to be cast as Mattie in \"True Grit\" and was keen on the role. However, prior to filming she made \"Secret Ceremony\" in England with Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Mitchum. While filming, Mitchum told her about \"True Grit\" director Henry Hathaway having a reputation for being rude to actresses. Farrow asked producer Hal Wallis to replace Hathaway. Wallis refused; Farrow then quit the role, which was then given to Kim Darby. \"Secret Ceremony\" divided critics, but has gone on to develop a devoted following. Farrow's other late 1960s films include \"John and Mary\", opposite Dustin Hoffman.\n\nIn the 1970s, Farrow performed in several classical plays in London including \"Mary Rose\", \"The Three Sisters\", and \"Ivanov\". She became the first American actress to join the Royal Shakespeare Company. During this time she appeared in several films, including the thriller \"See No Evil\" (1971), French director Claude Chabrol's \"Docteur Popaul\" (1972) and \"The Great Gatsby\" (1974), in which Farrow played Daisy Buchanan. She appeared in director Robert Altman's cult classic \"A Wedding\" (1978). In 1977, she played the title role in \"The Haunting of Julia\". Farrow appeared in several made-for-television films in the 1970s, most notably portraying the title role in a musical version of \"Peter Pan\" (1976). In 1979, she appeared on Broadway opposite Anthony Perkins in the play \"Romantic Comedy\" by Bernard Slade.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Farrow's relationship with director Woody Allen resulted in numerous film collaborations. She appeared in nearly all of Allen's films during this period, including leading roles in \"Zelig\", \"Broadway Danny Rose\", \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\", \"Hannah and Her Sisters\", \"Radio Days\" and \"Alice\" (1990). Farrow played Alura, mother of Kara (Helen Slater), in \"Supergirl\" (1984) and voiced the title role in the animated film \"The Last Unicorn\" (1982). She narrated several of the animated \"Stories to Remember\". Allen said that the way she played her character in \"Broadway Danny Rose\" was a \"very, very brave thing for her to do,\" as she had to play her role without ever using her eyes.\n\nCiting the need to devote herself to raising her young children, Farrow worked less frequently during the 1990s. Nonetheless, she appeared in leading roles in several films, including the Irish film \"Widows' Peak\" (1994), \"Miami Rhapsody\" (1995) and \"Reckless\" (also 1995). She appeared in several independent features and made-for-television films throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s and wrote an autobiography, \"What Falls Away\", in 1997.\n\nFarrow appeared as Mrs. Baylock, the Satanic nanny, in the remake of \"The Omen\" (2006). Although the film itself received a lukewarm critical reception, Farrow's performance was widely praised, with the Associated Press declaring \"thank heaven for Mia Farrow\" and calling her performance \"a rare instance of the new \"Omen\" improving on the old one.\" Filmcritic.com added \"it is Farrow who steals the show,\" and the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" described her performance as \"a truly delicious comeback role for Rosemary herself, Mia Farrow, who is chillingly believable as a sweet-talking nanny from hell.\" She worked on several films released in 2007, including the romantic comedy \"The Ex\" and the first part of director Luc Besson's trilogy of fantasy films, \"Arthur and the Invisibles.\" In 2008, in director Michel Gondry's \"Be Kind Rewind\", she appeared opposite Jack Black, Mos Def and Danny Glover. In 2011, Farrow appeared in the film \"Dark Horse\", directed by Todd Solondz.\n\nIn September 2014, Farrow returned to Broadway in the play \"Love Letters\". The play was well received by critics with the \"New York Times\" calling Farrow's performance \"utterly extraordinary… as the flighty, unstable and writing-averse Melissa Gardner.\"\n\nFarrow became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2000 and is a high-profile advocate for human rights in Africa, particularly for children's rights. She has worked to raise funds and awareness for children in conflict-affected regions and to draw attention to the fight to eradicate polio. Farrow has received several awards for her humanitarian work including the Leon Sullivan International Service award, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award and the Marion Anderson Award. In 2006, Farrow and her son Ronan visited Berlin in order to participate in a charity auction of United Buddy Bears, which feature designs by artists representing 142 U.N. member states. In 2008, \"Time\" magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.\n\nShe has traveled to Darfur several times for humanitarian efforts, first in 2004. Her third trip was in 2007, with a film crew engaged in making the documentary \"Darfur: On Our Watch\". The same year, she co-founded the Olympic Dream for Darfur campaign, which drew attention to China's support for the government of Sudan. The campaign hoped to change China's policy by embarrassing it in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing. In March 2007, China said it would urge Sudan to engage with the international community. The campaign persuaded Steven Spielberg to withdraw as an artistic adviser to the opening ceremony. During the Olympics, Farrow televised via the internet from a Sudanese refugee camp to highlight China's involvement in the region.\nLater in 2007, Farrow offered to \"trade her freedom\" for the freedom of a humanitarian worker for the Sudan Liberation Army who was being treated in a UN hospital while under threat of arrest. She wanted to be taken captive in exchange for his being allowed to leave the country. Farrow is also a board member of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Darfur Women Action Group (DWAG).\n\nIn 2009, Farrow narrated a documentary, \"As We Forgive\", relating the struggle of many of the survivors of the Rwandan Genocide to forgive those who murdered family and friends. To show \"solidarity with the people of Darfur\" Farrow began a water-only fast on April 27, 2009. Farrow's goal was to fast for three weeks, but she called a halt after twelve days on the advice of her doctor. In August 2010, she testified in the trial against former Liberian President Charles Taylor in the Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nFarrow helped build The Darfur Archives, which document the cultural traditions of the tribes of Darfur. She has filmed some 40 hours of songs, dances, children's stories, farming methods and accounts of genocide in the region's refugee camps that make up the current archives. Since 2011 the Archives have been housed at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut. In 2013, Farrow criticized President Barack Obama for his lack of address regarding Sudanese genocide during a United Nations General Assembly. In February 2015, Farrow appeared in an episode of \"A Path Appears\", a PBS documentary series from the creators of the Half the Sky movement. In the episode Farrow travels to Kibera, Kenya’s largest slum, to share stories from organizations providing education to at-risk girls.\n\nFarrow has also participated in environmental activism, in 2014 protesting against Chevron, accusing the oil company of environmental damage in the South American rainforest.\n\nIn February 1968, Farrow traveled to India, where she spent part of the year at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, studying Transcendental Meditation. Her visit received worldwide media attention because of the presence of all four members of The Beatles, Donovan, and Mike Love, as well as her sister Prudence Farrow. \n\nWhile she has been critical of the Roman Catholic Church (notably in the Pope's failure to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda, a predominantly Catholic country), Farrow is a devout Catholic and maintained in a 2013 interview with Piers Morgan that she had not \"lost her faith in God\". \n\nFarrow has stated that she has long been a registered Independent, though she has consistently voted for Democratic candidates. In the 2016 Democratic presidential election, Farrow endorsed Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders, though she subsequently stated that \"as a pragmatist\" she planned to vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn July 19, 1966, when Farrow was 22 years old, she married singer Frank Sinatra at the Las Vegas home of Jack Entratter. Farrow was 21 years old, Sinatra 50. Sinatra wanted Farrow to give up her acting career, which she initially agreed to do. She accompanied Sinatra while he was shooting several films, but soon tired of doing nothing and signed on to star in \"Rosemary's Baby\". Filming of \"Rosemary's Baby\" ran over its initial schedule, which angered Sinatra, who had cast Farrow in a role in his film \"The Detective\". After Farrow failed to report for filming, Sinatra cast actress Jacqueline Bisset in Farrow's role. In November 1967, while Farrow was filming \"Rosemary's Baby\", Sinatra's lawyer served her with divorce papers. Their divorce was finalized in August 1968. Farrow later blamed the demise of the marriage on their age difference, and said she was an \"impossibly immature teenager\" when she married Sinatra. The two remained friends until Sinatra's death.\n\nOn September 10, 1970, Farrow married conductor and composer André Previn in London; she was 25 and he was 41. Farrow had begun a relationship with Previn while he was still married to his second wife, songwriter Dory Previn. When Farrow became pregnant, Previn left Dory and filed for divorce. Farrow gave birth to twin sons in February 1970, and Previn's divorce from Dory became final in July 1970. Dory Previn later wrote a scathing song, titled \"Beware of Young Girls\", about the loss of her husband to Farrow. Previn and Farrow divorced in 1979.\nIn 1979, Farrow began a relationship with film director Woody Allen. During their relationship, Farrow starred in some of Allen's films, and several of her relatives also made appearances. Their relationship ended in 1992 when Allen began having an intimate relationship with Soon-Yi Previn (Farrow's adopted daughter) who was 22 years old at the time.\n\nAs of May 2018, Farrow had 11 living children (four biological, seven adopted). Three of her adopted children, Tam, Lark, and Thaddeus, are deceased.\n\nFarrow and former husband André Previn have three biological children: twins Matthew and Sascha (born February 26, 1970), and Fletcher (born March 14, 1974). Sascha is a graduate of Fordham University, while Fletcher, a graduate of Connecticut College, became the chief information officer of IBM. Farrow and Previn adopted Vietnamese infants Lark Song Previn and Summer \"Daisy\" Song Previn, in 1973 and 1976, respectively, followed by the adoption of Soon-Yi from Korea around 1978. Soon-Yi's precise age and birth date are not known, but a bone scan estimated her age as between 5 and 7 at the time of her adoption.\n\nIn 1980, following her divorce from Previn, Farrow as a single mother adopted Moses Farrow, a two-year-old Korean orphan with cerebral palsy. In 1985, Farrow adopted Dylan Farrow (born July 1985, adopted at two weeks old). Dylan was known as \"Eliza\" for some time and also as \"Malone.\" In December 1991, a New York City court allowed Allen to co-adopt Dylan and Moses.\n\nOn December 19, 1987, Farrow gave birth to their son Satchel O'Sullivan Farrow, later known as Ronan Farrow. In a 2013 interview with \"Vanity Fair\", Farrow stated Ronan could \"possibly\" be the biological child of Frank Sinatra, with whom she claimed to have \"never really split up\". In a 2015 \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview, Sinatra’s daughter Nancy dismissed the idea that her father is also the biological father of Ronan Farrow, calling it \"nonsense.\" She said that her children were affected by the rumor because they were being questioned about it. \"I was kind of cranky with Mia for even saying 'possibly,' she added. \"I was cranky with her for saying that because she knew better, you know, she really did. But she was making a joke! And it was taken very serious and was just silly, stupid.\"\n\nBetween 1992 and 1995, Farrow adopted five more children: Tam Farrow; Kaeli-Shea Farrow, later known as Quincy Maureen Farrow; Frankie-Minh; Isaiah Justus; Gabriel Wilk Farrow, later known as Thaddeus Wilk Farrow and named after Elliott Wilk, the judge who oversaw Farrow's 1993 legal battle with Allen. \n\nTam Farrow died of heart failure in 2000 at the age of 21 after a long illness. In May 2018, Moses Farrow made claims on his personal blog that Tam had actually died from a prescription medication overdose following a lifelong battle with depression. On December 25, 2008, Lark Previn died at the age of 35, also after a long illness. Moses claimed that Lark's death was due to AIDS-related illness, following a long battle with addiction. On September 21, 2016, Thaddeus Farrow was found dead at the age of 27 after an apparent car crash in Connecticut, though it was subsequently ruled he had committed suicide by shooting himself in the torso while inside his car.\n\nFarrow said that on August 4, 1992, Dylan Farrow, then aged seven, told Farrow that she had been sexually abused by Allen in their Connecticut home earlier that day. Farrow reported this to their pediatrician, who reported the allegations to authorities. Allen was informed of the accusations on August 6. A week later, on August 13, Allen sued for full custody of his biological son, Satchel, and two of Farrow's adopted children, Dylan and Moses, with whom Allen had assumed a parental role.\n\nIn March 1993, the lead doctor of Yale–New Haven Hospital Child Sexual Abuse Clinic's investigation into the allegations, Dr. John Leventhal, gave sworn testimony via a deposition that, in his opinion, Dylan \"either invented the story under the stress of living in a volatile and unhealthy home or that it was planted in her mind by her mother\" because of the \"inconsistent\" presentation of the story by Dylan. The doctor did not meet with Dylan before giving his testimony, and instead delivered his findings based on interviews conducted by others.\n\nThe team's findings were criticized by the presiding judge, and later by other experts in the field, who found their behavior unusual for making conclusive statements about innocence and guilt, instead of reporting on behavior, for refusing to testify in court when asked, and for destroying all their notes. Justice Wilk stated that the investigating team's behavior had \"resulted in a report which was sanitized and, therefore, less credible\" and that its recommendations and statements had \"exceed[ed] its mandate\". He concluded, \"I am less certain, however, than is the Yale-New Haven team, that the evidence proves conclusively that there was no sexual abuse.\"\n\nIn his final decision, in June 1993, Justice Wilk stated that he found \"no credible evidence to support Mr. Allen's contention that Ms. Farrow coached Dylan or that Ms. Farrow acted upon a desire for revenge against him for seducing Soon-Yi. Mr. Allen's resort to the stereotypical 'woman scorned' defense is an injudicious attempt to divert attention from his failure to act as a responsible parent and adult.\" He rejected Allen's bid for full custody and denied him visitation rights with Dylan, stating that even though the full truth of the allegations may never be known, \"the credible testimony of Ms. Farrow, Dr. Coates, Dr. Leventhal and Mr. Allen does, however, prove that Mr. Allen's behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her\".\n\nIn September 1993, the state's attorney, Frank Maco, announced he would not pursue Allen in court for the molestation allegations, despite having \"probable cause\", citing his and Farrow's desire not to traumatize Dylan further.\n\nIn February 2014, Dylan Farrow publicly renewed her claims of sexual abuse against Allen, in an open letter published by Nicholas Kristof, a friend of Farrow, in his \"New York Times\" blog. Allen repeated his denial of the allegations.\n\nIn 2013, Moses Farrow claimed that Mia had physically abused him. Moses also asserted that Farrow had coached her children into believing stories she made up about Allen. In May 2018, he wrote a blog post protesting his father's innocence, stating that, \"I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.\" Soon-Yi Previn echoed these claims in September 2018. \n\n\nInformational\n\nInterviews and articles\n"}

{"id": "27378533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27378533", "title": "Mohammed Jaber Al-Ansari", "text": "Mohammed Jaber Al-Ansari\n\nMohammed Jaber Al-Ansari, is a prominent Bahraini philosopher and political thinker, and an influential proponent of rational thinking in the 20th-century Arab World. He played a pivotal role in establishing the previously peripheral Persian Gulf region as an integral contributor to modern Arabic thought, on equal footing with other parts of the Arab World. His early work as a literary historian, and critic, instigated wide literary activity in his native Bahrain and in its surrounding Persian Gulf region. Al-Ansari was one of the early Arab intellectuals to delve into studying the East Asian experiences and draw comparisons with the Arab World.\n\nAl-Ansari was born in Bahrain in 1939 (then a British protectorate). Al-Ansari's first philosophical interests were shaped during the Nasserite 1950s, when the Arab World was in the midst of its struggle against colonialism and the fight for the creation of Pan-Arab Unity. Al-Ansari started to publish soon after he obtained his BA from the American University in Beirut in 1962. His early work covered historical and contemporary literary work in his native Bahrain and its neighboring countries. Compiled in one volume titled \"Glimpses at the Gulf\" (لمحات من الخليج), the volume sheds light on previously little known authors in this region because of its distance from the centers of Arab literary activity (essentially Cairo and Beirut were most Arabic publication originated.) \n\nIn 1969, Al-Ansari co-founded Bahrain's Literary Association (أسرة الأدباء والكتاب) and became its first President. In the same year, he was appointed to the State Council (Bahrain's first national cabinet) which oversaw the country’s transition to independence from Great Britain. In 1971, Al-Ansari gave up his cabinet position to pursue his intellectual and academic career. \nAl-Ansari received his Ph.D. in 1979. His dissertation which was published later in a volume titled Arabic Though and the Struggle of Opposites formed the base for his first intellectual project. The volume reveals Al-Ansari’s strategy of thinking and brings to light the main philosophical themes that he resonated in his later work. \n\nIn the following year, he published his major work, \"Transformation of Thought and Politics in the Arab East 1930-1970\" (تحولات الفكر والسياسة في المشرق العربي 1930-1970), which won him the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science Award. This significant work had a profound impact on the re-orientation of the Twentieth Century Persian Gulf from a mere receiver of Arab intellectual products into a competent contributor to the philosophical, cultural and political discourse in the wider Arab World.\n\nAl-Ansari moved to Paris in 1981, where he participated in the creation of L'Institut du Monde Arabe (The Arab World Institute). In 1983, Al-Ansari moved back to his Bahrain to become of one of the founders of the Arabian Gulf University where he became the Dean of the Higher Education Faculty until 2005. \n\nIn 1984, His Majesty the King of Bahrain (then the Crown Prince) retained Al-Ansari as his Cultural and Scientific Advisor, a position Al-Ansari still holds today. \n\nAl-Ansari resides in Bahrain with his wife Aysha. He has three daughters and nine grand children. He is currently Professor of Islamic Civilization and Modern Thought at the Arabian Gulf University.\n\nProfessor Al-Ansari work encompasses two parallel intellectual projects: \n\n\nIn his criticism of Arabic Thought, Al-Ansari promotes an indigenous methodology to interpret and understand the internal mechanisms adopted by Arab intellectuals in their diagnoses of the issues facing Arab societies throughout history. Al-Ansari coined the term ‘Arabic Syncretism’ to portray Arab intellectuals’ endeavors to reconcile the dialectical relationships formed between philosophy and religion, faith and reason, East and West etc. He concludes by exposing the inherent instability of this Syncretism because of its tendency to ferment a culture of deferment and ‘in-decision’. Throughout his work on this project, Al-Ansari uncovers the inability of Arabic Syncretism to sustain itself in the face of crises. This is further demonstrated through in-depth case studies of the rise and fall of the Nasserite (Egypt) and Ba'ath (Levant) experiments in twentieth century Arab Mashreq. \n\nAl-Ansari's study of the Arab's political reality aims to rise above the rhetorical and ideological clutter prevalent in the Arab World to establish a rational sociological approach to understanding Arab politics. In his rational style, Al-Ansari traces the socio-political history of the Arabs and dissects the compositions and dynamics of the various phases in this history. Al-Ansari, asserts that the Arabs’ political quandary is a major impediment to their overall progress in the modern World as it was in their past. In Al-Ansari’s view, the Arab peoples despite their long and rich history never had the opportunity to develop a stable, institutionalized State. One reason for this is the constant influence of nomadic (as opposed to the settled) elements of the Arab society, the constant movement of the center of power and the failure to dismantle no-state loyalties (e.g. tribal loyalties) on the continuity of a stable and civil structure of the state. The direct impact of this is the absence of indigenous Arabic political traditions which in turn have an indirect impact on the possibilities for a natural progression to democratic rule.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "522298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=522298", "title": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.", "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy Jr. (born January 17, 1954) is an American environmental attorney, author, and activist. Kennedy serves as president of the board of Waterkeeper Alliance, a non-profit environmental group that he helped found in 1999. He is the chairman of World Mercury Project (WMP), an advocacy group that seeks to reduce and eliminate mercury exposure from industry and pharmaceuticals such as vaccines.\n\nFrom 1986 until 2017, Kennedy served as senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a non-profit environmental organization. He served from 1984 until 2017 as board member and chief prosecuting attorney for Hudson Riverkeeper.\n\nFor over thirty years, Kennedy has been a professor of Environmental Law at Pace University School of Law in White Plains, New York. Until August 2017, he also held the post as supervising attorney and co-director of Pace Law School's Environmental Litigation Clinic, which he founded in 1987. He is currently professor emeritus at Pace.\n\nKennedy co-hosts \"Ring of Fire\", a nationally syndicated American radio program, and has written or edited ten books, including two \"New York Times\" bestsellers and three children's books.\n\nKennedy was born in Washington, D.C. on January 17, 1954. He is the third of eleven children of Senator and Attorney General Robert Francis \"Bobby\" Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy, and is a nephew of Joseph Patrick \"Joe\" Kennedy Jr., U.S. President John Fitzgerald \"Jack\" Kennedy, and longtime Senator Edward Moore \"Ted\" Kennedy. His aunt Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded Special Olympics, and another aunt, Jean Kennedy Smith, is a former US ambassador to Ireland.\n\nKennedy grew up at his family's home at Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia (a suburb of Washington). He was 9 years old when his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated during a political trip to Dallas, and 14 years old when his father was assassinated while running for president in the 1968 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy learned of his father's shooting when he was at Georgetown Preparatory School, his Jesuit boarding school in North Bethesda, Maryland. A few hours later he flew out to Los Angeles on vice-president Hubert Humphrey's plane along with his elder sister Kathleen and elder brother Joseph, and was with his father when he died. Kennedy served as a pallbearer in his father's funeral, where he spoke and read excerpts from his father's speeches at the Mass commemorating his death at Arlington National Cemetery. Following his father's death, he was arrested for loitering and marijuana possession in Hyannis, Massachusetts.\n\nAfter obtaining his high school diploma from the Palfrey Street School in Massachusetts, Kennedy continued his education at Harvard and the London School of Economics, graduating from Harvard College in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts in American History and Literature. He went on to earn a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia and a Master of Laws from Pace University.\n\nIn 1983, Kennedy served as Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan. In 1984, Kennedy joined Riverkeeper as an investigator, and was promoted to senior prosecuting attorney when he was admitted to the New York bar in 1985.\n\nKennedy is an environmental law specialist and partner in the law firms of Morgan & Morgan PA and of Kennedy & Madonna, LLP, and is an advocate for environmental justice.\n\nThrough litigation, lobbying, teaching, and public campaigns and activism, Kennedy has advocated for the protection of waterways, indigenous rights, and renewable energy.\n\nKennedy litigated and supervised environmental enforcement lawsuits on the east coast estuaries on behalf of Hudson Riverkeeper and the Long Island Soundkeeper, where he also served as a board member. Long Island Soundkeeper brought numerous lawsuits against cities and industries along the Connecticut and New York coastlines. In 1986, Kennedy won a landmark case against Remington Arms Trap and Skeet Gun Club in Stratford, Connecticut, that ended the practice of shooting lead shot into Long Island Sound. Kennedy also filed federal lawsuits to close the Pelham Bay landfill and the New York Athletic clubs, arguing that those facilities were interfering with public use of Long Island Sound. On the Hudson, Kennedy brought a series of lawsuits against municipalities, including New York City, to properly treat sewage, and against industries, including, Consolidated Edison, General Electric and Exxon, to stop discharging pollution and to clean up legacy contamination.\n\nIn 1995, Kennedy advocated for repeal of the anti-environmental legislation during the 104th Congress. In 1997, Kennedy co-authored The Riverkeepers with John Cronin. The book is a history of the early Riverkeepers and a primer for the Waterkeeper movement.\n\nDrawing on his experience investigating and prosecuting polluters on behalf of the Waterkeepers, Kennedy has written extensively about environmental law enforcement.\n\nIn 1987, Kennedy founded the Environmental Litigation Clinic at Pace University School of Law, where he served for three decades as the clinic's supervising attorney and co-director, and as Clinical Professor of Law. Kennedy obtained a special order from the New York State Court of Appeals that permitted his 10 clinic students–second- and third-year law students–to practice law and to try cases against Hudson River polluters in state and federal court, under the supervision of Kennedy and his co-director, Professor Karl Coplan. The clinic's full-time clients are Riverkeeper and Long Island Soundkeeper.\n\nThe clinic has prosecuted numerous governments and companies for polluting Long Island Sound and the Hudson River and its tributaries. The clinic argued cases to expand citizen access to the shoreline, and won hundreds of settlements for the Hudson Riverkeeper. Kennedy and his students also sued dozens of municipal waste-water treatment plants to force compliance with the Clean Water Act. In 2010, a Pace lawsuit forced ExxonMobil to clean up tens of millions of gallons of oil from legacy refinery spills in Newtown Creek in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nOn April 11, 2001, Men's Journal recognized Kennedy with its \"Heroes\" Award for his creation of the Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic. Kennedy and his Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic received other awards for successful legal work cleaning up the environment. The Pace Clinic became a model for similar environmental law clinics throughout the country including Rutgers, Golden Gate, UCLA, Widener, and Boalt Hall at Berkeley.\n\nIn June 1999, as Riverkeeper's success on the Hudson began inspiring the creation of Waterkeepers across North America, Kennedy and a few dozen Riverkeepers gathered in Southampton, Long Island to found the Waterkeeper Alliance, which now serves as the umbrella group for the 320 licensed Waterkeeper programs located in 38 countries. As President of the Alliance, Kennedy oversees its legal, membership, policy and fundraising programs. The Alliance states that it is dedicated to promoting \"swimmable, fishable, drinkable waterways, worldwide,\" and also serves as a clearinghouse, approving new Keeper programs and licensing use of the trademarked \"Waterkeeper,\" \"Riverkeeper,\" \"Soundkeeper,\" \"Lakekeeper,\" \"Baykeeper,\" \"Bayoukeeper,\" \"Canalkeeper,\" \"Coastkeeper,\" etc. names.\n\nKennedy and his environmental work have been the focus of several films including \"The Hudson Riverkeepers(1998)\" and \"The Waterkeepers (2000)\", both directed by Les Guthman. In 2008, he appeared in the IMAX documentary film , riding the length of the Grand Canyon in a wooden dory with his daughter Kick and with anthropologist Wade Davis.\n\nBeginning in 1991, Kennedy represented environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers in a series of lawsuits against New York City, New York State, and upstate watershed polluters. Kennedy authored a series of articles and reports alleging that New York State was abdicating its responsibility to protect the water repository and supply. In 1996, he helped orchestrate the $1.2 billion New York City Watershed Agreement, which New York Magazine recognized in its cover story, \"The Kennedy Who Matters.\" This agreement, which Kennedy negotiated on behalf of environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers, is regarded as an international model in stakeholder consensus negotiations and sustainable development.\n\nIn 2000, Kennedy and environmental lawyer Kevin Madonna founded the environmental law firm, Kennedy & Madonna, LLP, to represent private plaintiffs against polluters. The firm litigates environmental contamination cases on behalf of individuals, non-profit organizations, school districts, public water suppliers, Indian tribes, municipalities and states. In 2001, Kennedy & Madonna organized a team of prestigious plaintiff law firms to challenge pollution from industrial pork and poultry production. In 2004, the firm was part of a legal team that secured a $70 million settlement for property owners in Pensacola, Florida whose properties were contaminated by chemicals from an adjacent Superfund site.\n\nKennedy & Madonna is profiled in the HBO documentary Mann v. Ford that chronicles four years of litigation brought by the firm on behalf of the Ramapough Mountain Indian Tribe against the Ford Motor Company over the dumping of toxic waste on tribal lands in northern New Jersey. In addition to a monetary settlement for the tribe, the lawsuit contributed to the community's land being re-listed on the federal Superfund list, the first time in the nation's history that a de-listed site was re-listed. In 2007 Kennedy was one of three finalists nominated as \"Trial Lawyer of the Year\" by Public Justice for his role in the $396 million jury verdict against DuPont for contamination from its Spelter, West Virginia zinc plant. In 2017, the firm was part of the trial team that secured a $670 million settlement on behalf of over 3,000 residents from Ohio and West Virginia whose drinking water was contaminated with the toxic chemical, C8, which was released into the environment by DuPont in Parkersburg, West Virginia.\n\nIn 2016, Kennedy became counsel to the Morgan & Morgan PA|Morgan & Morgan P.A. law firm. The partnership arose from the two firms' successful collaboration on the case against SoCalGas Company following the Aliso Canyon gas leak in California. In 2017, Kennedy and his partners sued Monsanto in federal court in San Francisco, on behalf of plaintiffs seeking to recover damages for non-Hodgkins lymphoma, that, the plaintiffs allege, were a result of exposure to Monsanto's glyphosate-based herbicide, Roundup. Kennedy and his team also filed a class action lawsuit against Monsanto for failing to warn consumers about the dangers allegedly posed by exposure to Roundup. In September 2018, Kennedy and his partners filed a class-action lawsuit against Columbia Gas of Massachusetts alleging negligence following gas explosions in three towns north of Boston. Of Columbia Gas, Kennedy said “as they build new miles of pipe, the same company is ignoring its existing infrastructure, which we now know is eroding and is dilapidated.”\n\nIn 1998, Kennedy, Chris Bartle and John Hoving created a bottled-water company, Keeper Springs, which donated all of its profits to Waterkeeper Alliance. In 2013, Kennedy and his partner sold the brand to Nestlé in exchange for a donation to local Waterkeepers.\n\nKennedy served as a Venture Partner and Senior Advisor at VantagePoint Capital Partners, one of the world's largest cleantech venture capital firms. Among other activities, VantagePoint was the original and largest pre-IPO institutional investor in Tesla. VantagePoint also backed BrightSource Energy and Solazyme, amongst others. Kennedy serves as a board member and counselor to several of Vantage Point's portfolio companies in the water and energy space, including Ostara, a Vancouver-based company that markets the technology to remove phosphorus and other excessive nutrients from wastewater, transforming otherwise pollution directly into high grade fertilizer. He is also a senior advisor to Starwood Energy Group, and has played a key role in a number of the firm's investments.\n\nHe serves on the board of Vionx, a Massachusetts-based utility scale vanadium flow battery systems manufacturer. On October 5, 2017, Vionx, National Grid and the US Department of Energy completed the installation of advanced flow batteries at Holy Name High School in the town of Woburn, Massachusetts. The collaboration also includes Siemens and the United Technologies Research Center and constitutes one of the largest energy storage facilities in Massachusetts.\n\nKennedy is a Partner in ColorZen, which offers a turnkey cotton fiber pre-treatment solution that reduces water usage and toxic discharges in the cotton dying process.\n\nKennedy was a co-owner and Director of the smart grid company Utility Integration Solutions (UISol), which was acquired by Alstom. He is presently a co-owner and Director of GridBright, the market leading grid management specialist.\n\nIn October 2011, Kennedy co-founded EcoWatch, a leading environmental news site. He resigned from the board of directors in January 2018.\n\nIn his first case as an environmental attorney, Kennedy represented the NAACP in a lawsuit against a proposal to build a garbage transfer station in a minority neighborhood in Ossining, New York.\n\nIn 1987, he successfully sued Westchester County, New York, to reopen the Croton Point park, which was heavily used primarily by poor and minority communities from the Bronx. He then forced the reopening of the Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, which New York City had closed to the public and converted to a police firing range. Kennedy also led a battle to stop a plan to sell Washington D.C.'s Kingman Island—one of the rare National Parks in a minority neighborhood—to a private developer. In 2004, Kennedy and Riverkeeper successfully sued Exxon to clean up a large oil spill on Newton Creek in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\n\nKennedy has argued that poor communities shoulder the disproportionate burden of environmental insults. Speaking at SXSW Eco environmental conference in Austin in 2016, he said, \"Polluters always choose the soft target of poverty,\" noting as an example the highest concentration of toxic waste dumps in America resides in the south side of Chicago, and adding, \"Four out of five uncontrolled toxic waste dumps are in black neighborhoods. The largest toxic waste dump in America is in Emelle, Alabama which is 90% black.\"\n\nBeginning in 1985, Kennedy helped develop NRDC's international program for environmental, energy, and human rights. He worked on environmental issues across the Americas, and traveled regularly to Canada and Latin American to assist Indigenous tribes to protect their traditional homelands and to oppose large-scale energy and extractive projects in remote wilderness areas.\n\nIn 1990, Kennedy assisted the Pehuenche Indians in Chile in a partially successful campaign to stop the construction of a series of dams on Chile's iconic Biobío River. That campaign derailed all but one of the proposed dams. Beginning in 1992, he assisted the Cree Indians of northern Quebec in their campaign against Hydro-Québec to halt construction of some 600 proposed dams on eleven rivers in James Bay.\n\nIn 1993, Kennedy and NRDC, working with the indigenous rights organization Cultural Survival, clashed with other American environmental groups in a dispute about the rights of Indians to govern their own lands in the Oriente region of Ecuador. Kennedy represented the CONFENIAE, a confederation of Indian peoples, in negotiation with the American oil company Conoco to limit oil development in Ecuadorian Amazon and, at the same time, obtain benefits from resource extraction for Amazonian tribes. Kennedy was a vocal critic of Texaco for its previous record for polluting the Ecuadoran Amazon.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1999, Kennedy worked with five Vancouver Island Indian tribes in their campaign to end industrial logging by MacMillan Bloedel in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia.\n\nIn 1996, Kennedy met with Cuban President Fidel Castro to persuade the leader to halt his plans to construct a nuclear power plant at Juraguá. During a lengthy late night encounter, Castro reminisced about Kennedy's father and uncle, speculating that U.S. relations with Cuba would have been far better had President Kennedy not been assassinated.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, Kennedy and NRDC helped Mexican commercial fishermen to halt Mitsubishi's proposal to build a salt facility in the Laguna San Ignacio, a gray whale breeding, calving and nursery area in Baja, Mexico. Kennedy wrote extensively against the project, and took the campaign to Japan, meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi.\n\nIn 2000, he assisted local environmental activists to stop proposals by South Carolinian real estate developer Chaffin/Light and the U.S. engineering giant, Bechtel, from building a large hotel and resort development that, Kennedy argued, threatened coral reefs and public beaches used extensively by local Bahamians, at Clifton Bay, New Providence Island, Bahamas. Following this, the new Bahamian government designated the area a Heritage Park.\n\nKennedy was one of the early editors of \"Indian Country Today\", North America's largest Native American newspaper. He helped lead the opposition to the damming of the Futaleufú River in the Patagonia region of Chile. In 2016, citing the pressure precipitated by the Futaleufú Riverkeeper's campaign against the dams, the Spanish power company, Endesa, which owned the right to dam the river, reversed its decision and relinquished all claims to the Futaleufú.\n\nKennedy has been a critic of environmental damage by the US military. In 1993, he successfully represented the Suquamish and Duwamish Indian tribes in a lawsuit against the U.S. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, to stop polluting Puget Sound.\n\nIn an October 2001 \"Outside\" article titled \"Why Are We In Vieques?\" Kennedy described how he sued the United States Navy on behalf of fishermen and residents of the Island of Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico, to stop weapons testing, bombing, and the continuation of other military exercises on the Island. Kennedy argued that those activities were unnecessary for military preparedness, and that the Navy had illegally destroyed several endangered species, polluted the Island's waters, injured the health of Island residents and damaged the Island's economy. He was arrested for trespassing at Camp Garcia Vieques, the United States Navy training facility, where he and others were protesting the use of a section of the island for training. Kennedy served 30 days in a maximum security prison in Puerto Rico. The trespassing incident forced the suspension of live-fire exercises for almost three hours. The lawsuits and protests by Kennedy, and hundreds of Puerto Ricans who were also imprisoned, eventually forced the termination of naval bombing in Vieques announced by president George Bush in 2001, and enacted in 2003.\n\nIn a 2003 article for the \"Chicago Tribune\", Kennedy wrote, \"The federal government is America's biggest polluter and the Department of Defense is the government's worst offender. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, unexploded ordnance waste can be found on 16,000 military ranges across the U.S. and more than half may contain biological or chemical weapons. In total, the Pentagon is responsible for more than 21,000 potentially contaminated sites and, according to the EPA, the military may have poisoned as much as 40 million acres, a little larger than Florida.\"\n\nFor almost twenty years, Kennedy and his Waterkeepers waged a legal and public relations battle against pollution by factory farms. In the 1990s, he rallied opposition to factory farms among small independent farmers, convened a series of \"National Summits\" on factory meat products, and conducted press conference whistle stop tours across North Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio and in Washington DC.\nBeginning in 2000, Kennedy sued factory farms in North Carolina, Oklahoma, Maryland, and Iowa. He wrote numerous articles on the subject, arguing that factory farms produce lower quality, less healthy food, and are harmful to independent family farmers by poisoning their air and water, reducing their property values, and using extensive state and federal subsidies to impose unfair competition against smaller farmers.\n\nIn 1995, Premier Ralph Klein of Alberta declared Kennedy persona non grata in the province due to Kennedy's activism against Alberta's large-scale hog production facilities. In 2002, Smithfield Foods filed a lawsuit against Kennedy in Poland, under a Polish law that makes criticizing a corporation illegal, after Kennedy denounced the company in a debate with Smithfield's Polish director before the Polish parliament.\n\nKennedy has been an advocate for a global transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy. He has been particularly critical of the oil industry. He began his career at Riverkeeper during the time that the organization discovered that Exxon was using its oil tankers in order to steal fresh water from the Hudson River for use in its Aruba refinery and to sell to Caribbean Islands. Riverkeeper won a $2 million settlement against Exxon and lobbied successfully for a state law outlawing the practice. In one of his first environmental cases, Kennedy filed a lawsuit against Mobil Oil for polluting the Hudson.\n\nKennedy helped lead the battle against fracking in New York State. He had been an early supporter of natural gas as viable bridge fuel to renewables, and a cleaner alternative to coal. However, he said he turned against this controversial extraction method after investigating its cost to public health; climate and road infrastructure. As a member of Governor Andrew Cuomo's fracking commission, Kennedy helped engineer the Governor's 2013 ban on fracking in New York State.\n\nKennedy mounted a national effort against the construction of liquefied natural gas facilities. Waterkeepers maintains a national watch that documents numerous crude oil spills annually. In Alaska, Kennedy was active in the fight to save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the largest undisturbed ecosystem in North America, from drilling.\n\nIn 2013, Kennedy assisted the Chipewyan First Nation and the Beaver Lake Cree fighting to protect their land from tar sands production. In February 2013, while protesting the Keystone XL Pipeline Kennedy, along with his son, Conor, was arrested for blocking a thoroughfare in front of the White House during a protest. In August 2016, Kennedy and Waterkeeper participated in protests to block the extension of the Dakota Access pipeline across the Sioux Indian Standing Rock Reservation's water supply.\n\nKennedy claims that the only reason the oil industry is able to remain competitive against renewables and electric cars is through massive direct and indirect subsidies and political interventions on behalf of the oil industry. In a June 2017 interview on EnviroNews, Kennedy said about the oil industry, \"That's what their strategy is: build as many miles of pipeline as possible. And what the industry is trying to do is to increase that level of infrastructure investment so our country won't be able to walk away from it.\n\nUnder Kennedy's leadership, Waterkeeper launched its \"Clean Coal is a Deadly Lie\" campaign in 2001, bringing dozens of lawsuits targeting mining practices, which include mountaintop removal, slurry pond construction, and targeting mercury emissions and coal ash piles by coal burning utilities. Kennedy's Waterkeeper alliance has also been leading the fight against coal export, including from terminals in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nKennedy has promoted replacing coal energy with renewable energy, which, he argues, would thereby reduce costs and greenhouse gases while improving air and water quality, the health of the citizens, and the number and quality of jobs.\nIn June 2011, film producer Bill Haney televised his award-winning film, The Last Mountain, co-written by Haney and Peter Rhodes, depicting Kennedy's fight to stop Appalachian mountain top removal mining.\n\nKennedy has been an opponent of conventional nuclear power, arguing that it is unsafe and not economically competitive. On June 15, 1981, he made international news when he spoke at an anti-nuclear rally at the Hollywood Bowl, with Stephen Stills, Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne.\n\nHis thirty-year battle to close Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York ended in victory in January 2017, when Kennedy signed onto an agreement with New York State Governor, Andrew Cuomo, and Entergy, the plant's operator, to close the plant by 2021. Kennedy was featured in a 2004 documentary, Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable, directed by his sister, documentary film maker, Rory Kennedy.\n\nKennedy has been an outspoken opponent of dams, particularly of dam projects that affect indigenous communities.\n\nIn 1991, Kennedy helped lead a campaign to block Hydro-Quebec from building the James Bay Hydro-project, a massive dam project in northern Quebec. He was credited with mobilizing US political leaders and persuading New England lawmakers and New York officials, including New York Governor Mario Cuomo, to walk away from New York's multibillion-dollar contract with Hydro-Quebec. These actions helped to kill the project.\n\nHis campaigns helped block dams on Chile's Bio Bio and Futaleufu rivers in 1990 and 2016 respectively. In 2003, he mounted an ultimately unsuccessful battle against the building of a dam on the Macal River in Belize. Kennedy termed the Chalillo Dam \"a boondoggle,\" and brought a high-profile legal challenge against a Canadian power company, Fortis Inc., the monopoly owner of Belize's electric utility. That case ultimately lost in a split decision by the Privy Council in London, UK, the supreme court of British Commonwealth Nations.\n\nIn 2004, Kennedy met with Provincial officials and brought foreign media and political visitors to Canada to protest the building of dams on Quebec's Magpie River. Kennedy likened the damming of the Magpie for a mere 40 megawatts of power, \"to selling the Mona Lisa for $15 in a garage sale.\" On September 14, 2017, Hydro-Quebec announced that it will not build a hydroelectric dam on the Magpie River.\n\nIn November 2017, the Spanish hydroelectric syndicate, Endesa, announced its decision to abandon HydroAysen, a massive project to construct dams on dozens of Patagonia's rivers accompanied by thousands of miles of roads, power lines and other infrastructure. Endesa returned its water rights to the Chilean government. The Chilean press credits advocacy by Kennedy and Riverkeeper as critical factors in the company's decision.\n\nIn 2005, Kennedy clashed with national environmental groups over his opposition to a wind farm off Cape Cod. Taking the side of Cape Cod's commercial fishing industry, Kennedy argued that the Cape Wind Project in Nantucket Sound was a costly boondoggle. This position angered some environmentalists, and brought Kennedy criticism by industry groups and Republicans.\n\nThroughout the presidency of George W. Bush, Kennedy was a persistent critic of Bush's environmental and energy policies. He accused Bush of defunding and corrupting federal science projects. Kennedy's February 2004 article in The Nation, \"The Junk Science of George W. Bush,\" in which he wrote, \"The Bush Administration's first instinct when it comes to science has been to suppress, discredit or alter facts it doesn't like,\" has been recognized by Project Censored among top censored stories in their 2005 compilation.\nKennedy was also critical of Bush's hydrogen car proposal, which he characterized as a gift to the fossil fuel industry disguised as a green automobile.\n\nKennedy wrote an article titled, \"Crimes Against Nature\" about Bush's environmental record. The article, which was featured in the November 24, 2003 issue of Rolling Stone, was subsequently expanded into Kennedy's New York Times best-selling book of the same name, published by HarperCollins. Kennedy's opposition to the environmental policies of the Bush administration earned him recognition as one of Rolling Stone's \"100 Agents of Change\" on April 2, 2009.\n\nDuring an October 2012 telephone interview with Politico, Kennedy called on environmentalists to direct their dissatisfaction towards the U.S. Congress rather than President Barack Obama. Kennedy reasoned that Obama \"didn't deliver\" due to having a partisan U.S. Congress \"like we haven't seen before in American history.\" He also accused politicians who failed to act on climate change policy as serving special interests and, selling out the public trust. He accused Charles and David Koch, the owners of Koch Industries, Inc., the nation's largest privately owned oil company, of subverting democracy and for \"making themselves billionaires by impoverishing the rest of us.\" Kennedy has spoken of the Koch Brothers as leading \"the apocalyptical forces of Ignorance and Greed.\"\n\nDuring the 2014 People's Climate March, Kennedy said, \"American politics is driven by two forces: One is intensity, and the other is money. The Koch brothers have all the money. They're putting $300 million this year into their efforts to stop the climate bill. And the only thing we have in our power is people power, and that's why we need to put this demonstration on the street.\"\n\nKennedy was a founding board member of the Food Allergy Initiative. His son Conor suffers from anaphylaxis peanut allergies. Kennedy wrote the foreword to The Peanut Allergy Epidemic, in which he and the authors link increasing food allergies in children to certain vaccines that were approved beginning in 1989.\n\nKennedy has been a long-term advocate for reducing mercury exposures from industry and medicine. and is an outspoken opponent of the inclusion of the mercury-based preservative, thimerosal, in vaccines.\n\nIn June 2005, Kennedy authored an article in \"Rolling Stone\" and Salon.com titled \"Deadly Immunity\" alleging a government conspiracy to conceal a connection between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. The article contained five factual errors, leading Salon.com to issue corrections. Kennedy argued that the errors were insignificant and that some were made by Salon during the editing process. Six years later, on January 16, 2011, Salon retracted the article completely. According to Salon, the retraction was motivated by accumulating evidence of errors and scientific fraud underlying the vaccine-autism claim. Kennedy has accused Salon.com of caving into pressure from the pharmaceutical industries. \"Rolling Stone\" stands by Kennedy's story – as noted by \"Rolling Stone's\" editor: \"The link to this much-debated story by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was inadvertently broken during our redesign in the spring of 2010. (We did not remove the story from the site, as some have incorrectly alleged, nor ever contemplated doing so.)\".\n\nIn May 2013, Kennedy delivered the keynote address at the AutismOne / Generation Rescue conference.\n\nIn 2014 Kennedy published a book, \"Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak: The Evidence Supporting the Immediate Removal of Mercury—a Known Neurotoxin—from Vaccines\", which is an overview of over 400 published peer-reviewed studies on thimerosal. Kennedy has published many articles on the inclusion of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in vaccines, which have appeared in \"Huffington Post\", \"EcoWatch\",\nand \"The Boston Globe\".\n\nIn April 2015, Kennedy participated in a Speakers' Forum to promote the film, Trace Amounts, which links autism to mercury in vaccinations. At a screening of the film, Kennedy described the autism epidemic as a \"holocaust.\" He also spoke to vaccine safety advocates and testified before legislative bodies in Oregon, California, Indiana and New York to oppose new bills mandating vaccination.\n\nKennedy discussed the alleged association between vaccines, mercury and neurodevelopmental disorders on Real Time with Bill Maher on April 24, 2015, and Tucker Carlson Tonight on April 25, 2017 and July 10, 2017. However, the scientific consensus is that vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nOn December 14, 2016, Kennedy launched the World Mercury Project (WMP), an advocacy group with the mission to end exposures to mercury and other toxic metals in medicine and in industry.\n\nOn January 10, 2017, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump met to discuss a position in the Trump Administration. Kennedy accepted an offer made by Trump to become the chairman of the Vaccine Safety Task Force. A spokeswoman for Trump's transition said that no final decision had been made. In an August 2017 interview with STAT News reporter Helen Branwell, Kennedy said that he had been meeting with the Federal public health regulators to discuss alleged defects in vaccine safety science, at the White House's request.\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Kennedy and actor Robert De Niro gave a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington D.C., in which they accused the press of acting as propagandists for the $35 billion vaccination industry and refusing to allow debates on vaccination science. They offered a $100,000 reward to any journalist or other citizen who could point to a study showing that it is safe to inject mercury into babies and pregnant women at levels currently contained in flu vaccines. According to Professor Craig Foster, the challenge is \"not science. It is a carefully constructed 'contest' that allows its creators to generate the misleading outcome they presumably want to see\". The challenge is unwinable, the judges are De Niro and Kennedy. The $50 fee to apply would go to the WMP, something that vaccine supports are wary to do when they feel that the challenge itself is rigged towards the anti-vax stance. Finding a winner of the challenge would completely go against the aims of Kennedy, De Niro and WMP. If the applicant disputes the \"initial denial of a challenge submission\" then a panel of independent scientists would be consulted, with the applicant paying half of the $400 per hour rate to evaluate the claim. The contest asks for one single study that shows the safety of thimerosal in vaccines, yet science does not allow for one study to determine anything as factual. Foster states that \"Proving that something is safe is importantly different than proving that something is harmful\". Foster claims that the challenge is nothing more than \"celebrity-generated pseudoscience\" and the public should consider vaccines safe.\n\nIn January 2003, Kennedy wrote a controversial article in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" titled \"A Miscarriage of Justice\" about the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut. In the article, Kennedy insists that Michael Skakel's indictment \"was triggered by an inflamed media, and that an innocent man is now in prison.\" Skakel and Kennedy are first cousins, as Kennedy's mother and Skakel's father are siblings. Kennedy's article presents the argument that there is more evidence suggesting that Kenneth Littleton, the Skakel family's live-in tutor, killed Moxley. He also calls Dominick Dunne the \"driving force\" behind Skakel's prosecution. In July 2016, Kennedy released a book titled \"Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn't Commit\". In September 2017, the rights to Kennedy's book were optioned by FX Productions to develop a multi-part television series.\n\nOn the evening of January 11, 2013, Charlie Rose interviewed Robert Kennedy Jr. and his sister Rory at the Winspear Opera House in Dallas. This was part of Mayor Mike Rawlings' hand-chosen committee's year long program of celebrating the life and presidency of John F. Kennedy. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that he was convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald was not solely responsible for the assassination of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy; and said his father Robert Kennedy was \"fairly convinced\" that others besides Oswald were involved in his brother's assassination and privately believed the Warren Commission report was a \"shoddy piece of craftsmanship.\" Kennedy was 9 years old when President Kennedy was assassinated and 14 years old when Robert Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nKennedy has written extensively on foreign policy issues, beginning with a 1974 Atlantic Monthly article titled, \"Poor Chile,\" discussing the overthrow of Chilean President, Salvador Allende. Kennedy also wrote editorials against the execution of Pakistan President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. In 1975, he published an article in The Wall Street Journal, criticizing the use of assassination as a foreign policy tool. In 2005, he wrote an article for the Los Angeles Times decrying President Bush's use of torture as anti-American. Senator Edward Kennedy entered the article into the Congressional Record.\n\nIn an article titled \"Why the Arabs Don't Want Us in Syria,\" published in Politico in February 2016, Kennedy referred to the \"bloody history that modern interventionists like George W. Bush, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio miss when they recite their narcissistic trope that Mideast nationalists 'hate us for our freedoms.' For the most part they don't; instead they hate us for the way we betrayed those freedoms — our own ideals — within their borders.\" Kennedy blames the Syrian war on a pipeline dispute. He cites wiki-leaks documents alleging that the CIA led military and intelligence planners to foment a Sunni uprising against Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, following his rejection of a proposed Qatar-Turkey pipeline through Syria in 2009, well before the Arab Spring. In 2013, Kennedy wrote an article for Rolling Stone exploring President John F. Kennedy's difficult struggle with his own military and intelligence apparatus to keep America out of war and from becoming an imperial state.\n\nKennedy served on the National Staff and as a State Coordinator for Edward M. Kennedy for President from 1979 to 1980. Prior to that he had served on Senator Kennedy's 1970 and 1976 Massachusetts Senatorial Campaigns. He was a co-founder and a former board member of the New York League of Conservation Voters.\n\nKennedy endorsed and campaigned extensively for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 Presidential Campaign for Election. Kennedy openly opposed his friend Ralph Nader's Green party presidential campaign, predicting that Nader's effect could sink the Gore campaign and put George W. Bush into the White House. In the 2004 American presidential election, Kennedy endorsed John Kerry, noting his strong environmental record.\n\nIn late 2007, Kennedy and his sisters Kerry and Kathleen announced that they would be endorsing Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Presidential Primary. Following the Democratic Convention, Kennedy campaigned for Obama across the country. After the election, he was named as a front-runner for Obama's EPA administrator.\n\nKennedy has been critical of the integrity of the voting process. In June 2006 he published an analysis in Rolling Stone magazine purporting to show that GOP operatives stole the 2004 election for President George W Bush. Kennedy's conclusions were strongly attacked by Farhad Manjoo in a June 3, 2006 Salon.com article. However, in a critical response to Monjoo's attack, historian Eric Zuesse argued that Kennedy's analysis had been correct.\n\nKennedy has written frequent warnings about the ease of election hacking and the dangers of voter purges and voter ID laws. He wrote the introduction and a chapter in Billionaires and Ballot Bandits, a 2012 book on election hacking by investigative journalist Greg Palast.\n\nKennedy first considered running for political office in 2000, when New York Senator Moynihan announced he would not seek re-election to the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by Kennedy's father. His father was elected to the same seat in 1964, and held it for 41 months, until his death in 1968.\n\nIn 2005, Kennedy considered running for New York Attorney General. The possibility of a matchup against his then brother-in-law Andrew Cuomo generated media interest. Kennedy again decided not to run, despite being considered the frontrunner if he were to run.\n\nOn December 2, 2008, Kennedy announced that he did not wish to be appointed to the U.S. Senate by New York Governor David Paterson. He felt that it would take too much time away from his family.\n\nKennedy co-hosts the \"Ring of Fire\" radio program alongside Mike Papantonio, even though Kennedy suffers from spasmodic dysphonia, a disorder that makes speech difficult, and causes the voice to quaver. The show provides progressive news and commentary.\n\nKennedy has written two books and several articles on environmental issues. His articles have appeared in publications such as \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Newsweek\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"Atlantic Monthly\", \"Esquire\", \"The Nation\", \"Outside magazine\", and \"The Village Voice\".\n\nKennedy has authored or edited ten books on subjects ranging from the environment to science, biography and American heroes, including two bestsellers and three children's books. \n\nChildren's books\n\nSelected articles\n\nKennedy has penned numerous academic and general interest articles, as well as op-eds for magazines, journals, and newspapers. His writings have been included in anthologies of America's Best Crime Writing, Best Political Writing, and Best Science Writing. Kennedy's writings have appeared in: \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"Time Magazine\", \"the Los Angeles Times\", \"The Boston Globe\", \"The Houston Chronicle\", \"Newsweek\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", \"The New Yorker\", \"Vanity Fair\", \"Esquire\", \"New York Daily News\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", and \"Huffington Post\", among others. His writings range over diverse topics including oil, coal, green energy, election integrity, politics, the media, falconry, foreign policy, and civil rights. Kennedy is also a frequently published travel writer.\n\n\nKennedy is a licensed master falconer, and has trained hawks since he was 11. He breeds hawks and falcons and is also licensed as a raptor propagator and a wildlife rehabilitator. He holds permits for Federal Game Keeper, Bird Bander, and Scientific Collector. He was President of the New York State Falconry Association from 1988 to 1991. In 1987, while serving on Governor Mario Cuomo's New York State Falconry Advising Committee, Kennedy authored the examination to qualify apprentice falconers given by New York State. Later that year he wrote the \"New York State Apprentice Falconer's Manual\", which was published by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and continues in use today.\n\nKennedy is also a whitewater kayaker. His father introduced him and his siblings to whitewater kayaking during early trips down the Green and Yampa Rivers in Utah and Colorado, the Columbia River, the Middle Fork Salmon in Idaho, and the Upper Hudson Gorge. From 1976 to 1981, Kennedy was a partner and guide at a white water company, \"Utopian,\" based in West Forks, Maine. He organized and led several \"first-descent\" white-water expeditions to Latin America including three to hitherto unexplored rivers: the Apurimac, Peru, in 1975; the Atrato, Colombia, in 1979; and the Caroni,Venezuela, in 1982. He made an early descent of Great Whale River in Northern Quebec, in 1993, and has made many trips to Patagonia, Chile to run the Biobío River, the Futaleufú and other whitewater rivers.\n\nIn 2015, he took two of his sons to the Yukon to visit Mount Kennedy and run the Alsek River, a whitewater river fed by the Alsek Glacier, which flows off Mt. Kennedy. Mt. Kennedy was the highest unclimbed peak in Canada, when the Canadian Government named it for the assassinated American president, in 1964. Kennedy's father, Robert Kennedy, was the first to climb Mt. Kennedy in 1965.\n\nKennedy married Emily Ruth Black (b. 1957) on April 3, 1982. They had two children: Robert Francis \"Bobby\" Kennedy III (b. 1984) and Kathleen Rose Kennedy (b. 1988). The couple separated in 1992 and divorced in 1994.\n\nOn April 15, 1994, Kennedy married Mary Kathleen Richardson (1959–2012) aboard a research vessel on the Hudson River. They had four children: John Conor Richardson Kennedy (b. 1994), Kyra LeMoyne Kennedy (b. 1995), William Finbar \"Finn\" Kennedy (b. 1997), and Aidan Caohman Vieques Kennedy (b. 2001). On May 12, 2010, Kennedy filed for divorce from Mary; three days later she was charged with drunken driving. On May 16, 2012, Mary was found dead in a building on the grounds of her Mount Kisco, New York, home. The Westchester County Medical Examiner ruled the death to be a suicide due to asphyxiation from hanging.\n\nKennedy married his third wife, actress-director Cheryl Hines, on August 2, 2014, at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1983, at age 29, Kennedy was arrested in a Rapid City, South Dakota airport for heroin possession after a search of his carry-on bag uncovered the drug, following a near overdose in flight. Kennedy entered a guilty plea to Presiding Judge Marshall P. Young, who sentenced him to two years' probation and 1,500 hours of community service. Following his arrest, Kennedy entered a drug treatment center and left employment as a government prosecutor.\n\nIn 1999, Kennedy hired William Wegner to work for Riverkeeper. He was a fishery scientist and falconer who had been sentenced to five years in prison; he served three years after pleading guilty to federal criminal charges for smuggling bird eggs from Australia. In 2000, Robert Boyle, Riverkeeper's founder and former president, fired Wegner, citing his criminal conviction, but Kennedy re-hired Wegner, believing he should be given a second chance. A majority of the Riverkeeper Board supported Kennedy's decision, but seven members joined Boyle in resigning.\n\nIn September 2013, \"The New York Post\" released excerpts from Kennedy's 2001 diary, in which Kennedy described multiple affairs, and penned his opinions about public figures. Kennedy said the paper had indeed printed his diary.\n\nKennedy suffers from spasmodic dysphonia, a disorder that makes speech difficult, and causes the voice to quaver.\n\nOver the course of his career, Kennedy has received numerous awards in his name and on behalf of organizations and causes that he has championed.\n\n\n\n"}

She is the author of the famous Creole Waltz \"Desde el alma\" for which she is known as the first widely recognized female Rioplatense Hispanic composer in the world.\n\nRosita was born in Montevideo on July 9, 1897, as the youngest child of Italian immigrants Michele Mela and Rosa Luciano de Mela. She was baptized at the cathedral of Montevideo. Shortly after, the family migrated to Argentina in 1900. They settled in Buenos Aires when Rosita was three years old. On February 23, 1922, she married the young poet and writer Victor Piuma Vélez who would write the lyrics for all her compositions.\n\nRosita showed a great talent for music. At the age of four she could already play the piano by ear. Once in primary school, she never gave up her music studies. She later studied piano in Buenos Aires and ultimately became a professor of piano and concert at the prestigious Thibaud-Piazzini conservatory.\n\nThroughout her life, she created a body of work that includes tango, waltz, classical and Creole waltzes, pasodobles, polkas and marches. Among them: \"Oración\", \"Tatita\" and \"Aquel entonces\" as well as the waltzes \"Yo te adoro\", \"Por el camino\", \"Una lágrima para papá\", \"Cuando de ti ya lejos\" and \"Aquellos catorce años\".\n\nThe poems of Rosita were published in newspapers and cultural magazines of her time. Her poems were published in the book \"Antología de poetas jóvenes\" (\"Anthology of Young Poets\") alongside those of Alfonsina Storni and other famous contemporary poets. She gave many concerts of both classical and popular music in different cultural centers in Buenos Aires, earning medals and awards.\nShe was appointed as a representative of music in a ceremony held at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1911, at the age of 14, Rosita Melo composed her first and now world-famous Boston-style Creole waltz \"Desde el Alma\" (\"From the Soul\"). Other sources date the composition between 1911 and 1917.\nRosita is quoted saying it was the work of an adolescent.\n\nThe waltz's theme is dedicated to the love of a mother.\n\nHer husband, Victor Piuma Vélez, would write the first set of lyrics for it, years later.\n\nBy 1921, Roberto Firpo had recorded four instrumental waltzes of Rosita.\nIn 1948, Homero Manzi wanted to include the waltz in the movie \"Pobre mi madre querida\", but with different lyrics rewritten by himself which would be sung by Hugo del Carril.\n\nVélez and Melo initially opposed the idea, and requested that if Manzi wrote new lyrics, Vélez's name should be included as co-author. Manzi ultimately agreed, the lyrics became famous and the waltz, already a classic by the time, became universally famous.\n\nManzi's lyrics remain the most famous ones and are often reinterpreted in different versions of the song when performed by other musicians:\n\nAfter her husband passed away in 1976, Rosita Melo died in Buenos Aires on August 12, 1981 and was buried at the \"Rincón de las Personalidades\" (\"Corner of Personalities\") in the Chacarita Cemetery there.

Dominique Christina and Denice Frohman are both Women of the World Poetry Slam Champions. Their collaboration has brought them success over the last two years as they have been to over 90 universities, colleges, conferences, and many other spaces across the United States. Inspired by the life of Audre Lorde, their premise is to encourage students and people across all generations to understand the power of art. They believe art can be a form of activism and expression that goes well beyond the page. Aside from their vivid performances, Sister Outsider also offers workshops to help students with their poetry writing as well as the delivery aspect to slam poetry.\n\nChristina and Frohman specialize in poetry about injustice amongst marginalized communities, people of color, and LGBTQ communities. Through poetry they break the silence and use it as a tool for social change on poverty issues and stereotypes amongst these communities . They stand against such margins of violent and unhealthy culture by going by the slogan, \"We Exist. We Resist.\" Their use of spoken word and personal stories spark conversation and encourage discussion on political and social issues. Their ability to incorporate activism with writing is what makes this duo inspiring.\n\n“Before Sister Outsider left the Wabash campus, students were already discussing how best to go about bringing them back again. Sister Outsider provided the campus with an extremely engaging and entertaining evening of stellar performances during an evening show that was filled to capacity. Thank you Sister Outsider, for providing such needed and appreciated work.”\n\n-Professor Perez, History Dept., ShOUT & Unidos Por Sangre Student Org. Advisor, Wabash College\n\n“Sister Outsider’s performance to packed audience at Dartmouth College was inspiring in its honesty, integrity and ability to use the spoken word as a platform for education, communication, and social change. Their performance and workshops provided a space for all students to think critically, question, and challenge the status quo. For students who feel outside the norm or at the margins of acceptance, Sister Outsider’s poetry and message reinforces the fact that their presence, position, and voice are equal in both legitimacy and importance.

{"id": "3019805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3019805", "title": "Steel detailer", "text": "Steel detailer\n\nA steel detailer is a person who produces detailed drawings for steel fabricators and steel erectors. The detailer prepares detailed plans, drawings and other documents for the manufacture and erection of steel members (columns, beams, braces, trusses, stairs, handrails, joists, metal decking, \"etc.\") used in the construction of buildings, bridges, industrial plans, and nonbuilding structures. A steel detailer's projects are usually commercial, residential, public, industrial or municipal; low-rise residential projects..\n\nSteel detailers (usually simply called \"detailers\" within their field) work closely with architects, engineers, general contractors and steel fabricators. They usually find employment with steel fabricators, engineering firms, or independent steel detailing companies. Steel detailing companies and self-employed detailers subcontract primarily to steel fabricators and sometimes to general contractors and engineers.\n\nCollegiate degree programs specific to structural steel detailing are rare to nonexistent in the U.S., but more general degree and certification programs may be found with curricula pertaining to design, manual or computer-aided drafting in general, or specific computer-aided drafting software. A college degree is not required to become a steel detailer in the U.S. Training is usually provided on the job, with a new trainee usually needing about five years of practice under an experienced detailer to become proficient with all of the requirements of the trade. Practitioners of this occupation in the U.S. may range from degreed, and possibly licensed, civil/structural engineers to those with little or no formal academic training who nevertheless possess extensive industry experience.\n\nCertification of structural steel detailers is not required in the United States. The National Institute of Steel Detailing (NISD) offers a selection of certification programs for steel detailers and detailing companies, but these are strictly voluntary.\n\nIn Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada there are College courses specifically for Steel Detailing. Vancouver Community College Downtown Campus has been offering a Steel Detailing Certificate for many years. It is approximately a one-year program. BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology) also offers training. Many of the most well trained Steel Detailers in British Columbia have attended these institutions.\n\nA steel detailer prepares two primary types of drawings: erection drawings and shop drawings.\n\nErection drawings are used to guide the steel erector on the construction site (\"in the field\") as to where and how to erect the fabricated steel members. These drawings usually show dimensioned plans to locate the steel members, and they often also show details with specific information and requirements, including all work that must be done in the field (such as bolting, welding or installing wedge anchors). Since the erection drawings are intended for use in the field, they contain very little specific information about the fabrication of any individual steel member; members should already be completed by the time the erection drawings are used.\n\nShop drawings, also called detail drawings, are used to specify the exact detailing requirements for fabricating each individual member (or \"piece\") of a structure, and are used by the steel fabricator to fabricate these members. Complete shop drawings show material specifications, member sizes, all required dimensions, welding, bolting, surface preparation and painting requirements, and any other information required to describe each completed member. The shop drawings are intended for use by the fabrication shop, and thus contain little or no information about the erection and installation of the steel members they depict; this information belongs in the erection drawings.\n\nThe detailer must comply with the requirements of the design drawings and with all industry standards and protocols, such as those established by the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) and the American Welding Society (AWS). The detailer is usually not responsible for design, including structural strength, stiffness, and stability (which are the responsibility of the structural engineer), major dimensions of the structure and compliance with relevant building codes (which are the responsibility of the architect). A detailer is generally required to submit his drawings to the structural engineer and/or architect for review prior to the release of drawings for fabrication. However, to complete his drawings, an experienced steel detailer usually suggests connections subject to the approval of the structural engineer in cases where the structural drawings have insufficient information. In these situations, the steel detailer is guided by his experience and knowledge of existing engineering codes such as the Steel Construction Manual published by AISC.\n\nIn the case of non-building structures there is typically no architect, and detail drawings are reviewed exclusively by the structural engineer of record. This design review ideally assures engineering accuracy and compliance with the design intent.\n\nTraditionally, steel detailing was accomplished via manual drafting methods, using pencils, paper, and drafting tools such as a parallel bar or drafting machine, triangles, templates of circles and other useful shapes, and mathematical tables, such as tables of logarithms and other useful calculational aids. Eventually, hand held calculators were incorporated into the traditional practice.\n\nToday, manual drafting has been largely replaced by computer-aided drafting (CAD). A steel detailer using computer-aided methods creates his drawings on a computer, using software specifically designed for the purpose, and printing out his drawings on paper only when they are complete. Many detailers would add another classification for those using 3-D Modeling applications specifically designed for steel detailing, as the process for the production of drawings using these applications is markedly different from a 2-D drafting approach. The detailer literally builds the project in 3D before producing detailed shop drawings from the model. \n\nStructural steel detailing requires skills in drafting, mathematics (including geometry and trigonometry), logic, reasoning, spatial visualization, and communication. A basic knowledge of general engineering principles and the methods of structural and miscellaneous steel fabrication, however acquired, is essential to the practice of this discipline. A computer-aided detailer also requires skills in using computers and an understanding of the specific CAD software he is to use.\n\nA detailer's drawings generally go through several phases. If there is any unclear information that would prevent the detailer from creating or completing the drawings accurately, a request for information(RFI) is sent to the relevant trades(typically the general contractor, architect or structural engineer) before proceeding. If the required information is not needed immediately, then the detailer may opt to list the questions on the drawings. Following creation of the drawing, the detailer must usually (as described above) submit a copy of the drawing to the architect and engineer for review (\"approval\"). Copies of the drawing may be sent to other recipients at this time as well, such as the general contractor, for informational purposes only. The drawing must also be checked for accuracy and completeness by another detailer (for this purpose, the \"checker\"). To keep track of changes during the drawing creation workflow, the revisions are identified by incrementing an associated number or letter code which should appear in the drawing revision block. Comments arising from approval and corrections made during checking must be resolved, and the original drawing must be updated accordingly (or \"scrubbed\"). After this, the drawing may be released to the fabricator and/or erector for use in construction.\n\n"}

From 1951 to 1953, he served as a corporal in U.S. Army Intelligence in France and Germany. Returning to the U.S. after his military service, he enrolled in Pennsylvania State University, where he majored in Russian area studies, graduating with a bachelor's degree in history in 1955. \n\nAfter a few months working as an analyst at the National Security Agency, Marchetti joined the CIA in October 1955. He began his career as an analyst in the Office of Research and Reports, eventually serving a tour of duty in the Office of National Estimates (ONE).\n\nFrom ONE, Marchetti moved to the Office of Planning, Programming, and Budgeting in 1966, where he worked for over two years. Beginning in July 1968, he served for nine months as special assistant to CIA Deputy Director Rufus Taylor. His final position in the Agency was on the Planning, Programming, and Budget Staff of the National Photographic Interpretation Center. Among other projects with which he was involved, Marchetti worked on setting up the Pine Gap satellite ground station near Alice Springs in Central Australia.\n\nIn September 1969, Marchetti resigned from the CIA.\n\nAfter leaving the CIA, Marchetti began a writing career. His first work was a novel called \"The Rope-Dancer,\" published in 1971. The plot involves an officer in the \"National Intelligence Agency\" who becomes a spy for the Soviet Union. During public appearances promoting his novel, Marchetti announced that he was writing a non-fiction work on the agency, and in March 1972 he completed a draft of an article for Esquire magazine which according to a later CIA account, included \"names of agents, relations with named governments, and identifying details of ongoing operations.\" CIA received a copy of the article and an outline of Marchetti's book which he had submitted to a publisher, and decided to seek an injunction against publication.\n\nOn December 12, 1972, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Marchetti's appeal challenging a CIA policy that former employees must submit materials to the Agency for approval prior to publication.\n\nIn 1974, Marchetti's book was published as \"The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence\". The book, co-written with John D. Marks, was harshly critical of the CIA. Before publication, the CIA demanded that Marchetti remove 399 passages, but Marchetti resisted and only 168 passages were censored. It is the first book the federal government of the United States ever went to court to censor before its publication. The publisher (Alfred A. Knopf) chose to publish the book with blanks for censored passages and with boldface type for passages that were challenged but later uncensored.\n\nIn 1976 Marchetti published \"Foreign and Military Intelligence\" and in 1978 he published an article about the JFK assassination in the far-right newspaper of the Liberty Lobby, \"The Spotlight.\" Marchetti, a proponent of the organized crime and the CIA conspiracy theory, claimed that the House Select Committee on Assassinations revealed a CIA memo from 1966 that named E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis and Gerry Patrick Hemming in the JFK assassination. Marchetti also claimed that Marita Lorenz offered sworn testimony to confirm this. The HSCA reported that it had not received such a memo and rejected theories that Hunt was involved in a plot to kill Kennedy.\n\nIn 1981, E. Howard Hunt sued the Liberty Lobby and Marchetti for defamation and won $650,000 in damages. Liberty Lobby appealed the case with lawyer, Mark Lane. On February 1, 1985, Marchetti stated that key parts of his of articles were based upon rumors that he heard from \"Penthouse\" columnist Bill Corson and that he had no corroboration of Corson's story. Corson had provided an earlier deposition stating that he not discussed the rumors with Marchetti. Marchetti, Liberty Lobby and Lane won the appeal in 1985. Commenting afterward, two jurors rejected that the conspiracy theories offered by Lane influenced the verdict. Lane wrote a book, \"Plausible Denial\", to describe the unfolding of that historic trial.\n\nMarchetti suffered from dementia in his last years. He died at his home in Ashburn, Virginia at the age of 88.\n"}

His most famous work is \"Chronicle of Four Generations\" (five volumes, 1881–86), an account of the fictional Gorbatov family from the time of Catherine the Great to the mid-nineteenth century. Solovyov's \"atmosphere of nostalgia for the vanished age of the nobility\" helps explain his \"posthumous popularity among Russian émigrés.\"\n\nOldest son of the historian Sergei Solovyov and brother of the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov, Vsevolod turned to writing historical fiction in 1876 with \"Princess Ostrozhskaya\". He visited Paris in 1884 where he met Blavatsky and mixed with other people in the Paris occult scene, such as Juliette Adam, Vera Jelikovsky, Blavatsky's sister, and Emilie de Morsier. By 1886 he had become a bitter and disillusioned enemy of the founder of theosophy. He abandoned his plans to promote theosophy in Russia and denounced Blavatsky as a failed spy of the Okhrana. At the time he was intimately involved with Yuliana Glinka, who worked for Pyotr Rachkovsky, Paris head of the Okhrana.\n\nOf his later novels, the best known are \"The Magi\" (1889) and \"The Great Rosicrucian\" (1890), dealing with mystics of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.\n\n\n"}

They found, however, that Anglo immigration had been suspended by the government of Mexico. Furthermore, the area in which the Reeds planned to settle was in dispute between partisans of the empresarios Sterling C. Robertson and Stephen F. Austin. Nevertheless, Reed and his brother-in-law, William Crain Sparks, explored territory in what is now Bell County south of Temple, Texas. The two selected lands along the south bank of the Little River for various family members near what is now the community of Salado. Robertson gained control of the colony in 1834 while Austin was imprisoned on false charges in Mexico City.\n\nWhen the Texas Revolution began in 1835, William Whitaker Reed joined the Texian Army and served under Captain L. H. Mabbett. In April 1836, Reed, who was just 20 years of age, was among those who dug the mass grave to hold the burned and charred remains of the 344 men under Colonel James Fannin who were massacred on orders of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna at Goliad west of Victoria, Texas.\n\nAfter the war, William Whitaker Reed returned to his homestead. In 1841, he wed the former Emeline Cobb (1825-1890), the seventh of eleven children of Stancil Cobb (1792-1851) and the former Mila Reed (1793-1864). The couple had ten children. The area was settled, deserted, then resettled several times by the founding pioneers. In 1850, five years after Texas statehood Reed participated in the election of a commissioners' court to organize Bell County. That same year, he was elected the first county sheriff and served two terms.\nThe house which Reed built in 1850 was restored and relocated in 2008 as the Salado Visitor's Center. The structure is made of hand-hewn oak logs cut from the bottoms of the Little River. Larger than most frontier cabins, it is designed in the dogtrot style, with two main rooms separated by an open breezeway. Fireplaces made of native limestone provided heat and cooking. The house was windowless except for small openings from which to fire a gun. It was designed for both shelter and security at a time when attacks from Indians, was a recurring threat. Through successive generations, members of the Reed family protected and preserved the 1850 homestead and made possible its current use.\n\nWilliam Whitaker Reed died at the age of seventy-five a year after the passing of his wife. They are interred on Reed family land.\n"}

Hankin's first purchase was the land of Rehovot, acquired in 1890. A year later he bought the land that later became the settlement and city of Hadera. He then purchased territories for the Jewish Colonial Association in the Galilee.\n\nIn 1888 Hankin married Olga Belkind (1852–1943) in Gedera. She was a woman twelve years his senior, who would become his partner in all his endeavors. Their marriage remained childless.\n\nIn 1908, when the Zionist organization sent Arthur Ruppin and set up the Palestine Land Development Company, Hankin joined. In 1909 or 1910, Hankin completed his first major purchase in the Jezreel Valley. He bought some 10,000 dunams (10 km²) of land in Al-Fuleh, which became the home of Merhavia. This purchase also marked the start of bitter disputes between Arabs and Jews over the rights of tenant farmers who had been evicted, and regarding the employment of Jewish or Arab watchmen for the land.\n\nIn his article, \"Buying the Emek\", Arthur Ruppin described the vicissitudes of this purchase:\n\nBecause of the reluctance of Zionist organizations to pay for land, Hankin frequently agreed to purchase lands and then convinced the Jewish agency or others to finance the \"done deal.\" As Ruppin notes:\n\nDuring World War I, Hankin was exiled by the Turks to Anatolia. Returning to Palestine, he soon resumed his work where he had left off. In 1920, he concluded a deal with the Sursuk family of Beirut for purchase of 60,000 dunams (60 km²) of land in the Jezreel Valley. He negotiated for this land when he had in fact not a penny to finance the purchase. The chairman of the Jewish National Fund, Nehemiah De Lieme, refused to pay for the land, arguing that it was beyond the budget of the Fund, but he was overruled by the Zionist organization and in particular Chaim Weizmann. This tract became home to numerous new kibbutzim and other settlements, including Nahalal, Ginegar, Kfar Yehezkel, Geva, Ein Harod, Tel Yosef and Beit Alfa. Half of this land was unirrigated and considered of low value, but the remainder contained about 500 Arab tenant farmers. These latter, though reimbursed above and beyond the requirements of the law, continued to complain of dispossession.\n\nSubsequently, Hankin was involved in large scale purchases of land in and around Acco. In 1927, Hankin proposed an ambitious 20 year land purchase plan to the Jewish Agency for Israel, a plan that was never carried out in full. In 1932 he became head of the Palestine Land Development Corporation.\n\nHankin understood the necessity to plan for Arab as well as Jewish settlement, and apparently intended to do so. In July 1930 he wrote:\n\nHankin died in Tel Aviv and was buried in the Galilee next to his wife Olga, at the house (\"Bet Hankin\") he had built for themselves at Ein Harod on Mount Gilboa.\n\n\n"}
