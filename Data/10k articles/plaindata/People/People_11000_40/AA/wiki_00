They may differ at international, national, legal, cultural, social, professional and program levels from general or mainstream child protection services. Fundamental human rights are a source of many of the differences. Aboriginal child protection may be an integral or a distinct aspect of mainstream services or it may be exercised formally or informally by an aboriginal people itself. There has been controversy about systemic genocide in child protection systems enforced with aboriginal children in post-colonial societies.\n\n\"In the second half of the twentieth century, removing children from their parents in order to change a people and a culture came to be recognized as an act of oppression, formally considered by the United Nations to be a form of genocide.\"\nMany distinct aspects of aboriginal child protection are thus related to international human rights law including the 1951 \"Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\", the 1976 \"International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\", the 1986 \"Declaration on Social and Legal Principles Relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption Nationally and Internationally\" the 1989 \"United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child\", and the 2007 \"United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\"\nThe latter Declaration provides: \"Indigenous peoples have the collective right to live in freedom, peace and security as distinct peoples and shall not be subjected to any act of genocide or any other act of violence, including forcibly removing children of the group to another group.\"\nIt is non-binding but may be persuasive even for those states that voted against it.\nWithin countries, the expression of aboriginal child protection may be seen to be entangled with issues relating to the right of self-determination of indigenous peoples.\n\nThe domestic law of a country does not generally recognize an international law unless it is specifically introduced by the domestic law of that country.\nThis may occur by express statutory provision or by a domestic court having regard to an international norm as reflecting social progress.\nEven without being specifically introduced into domestic law, international norms may have political effects especially in countries that actively espouse human rights.\nAboriginal child protection issues tend to be prominent in countries colonized by a new majority population within the last few centuries.\nAssimilative policies arose, regardless of whether colonization proceeded mainly by force as in the United States of America and Australia or by treaty as in Canada and New Zealand.\nBy the end of the twentieth century, assimilative policies were generally replaced in legislation, policy or practice by the Aboriginal Child Placement Principle which \"outlines a preference for the placement of Aboriginal children with Aboriginal people when they are placed outside their families.\nThe order of preference is generally that an Aboriginal child be placed: within the child’s extended family; or, if this is not possible, within the child’s Aboriginal community; and, failing that, with other Aboriginal people.\"\nVersions of this principle refashioned aboriginal child protection in Western post-colonial democracies along lines shaped by constitutional responsibilities: state in Australia, federal in the United States, federal/provincial in Canada and national in New Zealand, with constitutionalized Treaties playing a pivotal role in New Zealand and an emerging role in Canada.\n\nIn Australia, “Traditionally, the Aboriginal family was a collaboration of clans composed of mothers, fathers, uncles, aunties, brothers, sisters, cousins and so on. This size of family was the norm but is recognised in today's terms as an 'extended family'.” In 1983, a Family Court worker noted: \"[T]he strength of family affiliation goes a long way to explain the preservation of a distinct culture that has defied assimilation despite aggressive government policies for over a century.\" Constitutionally, \"The responsibility for legislating for children's welfare lies with each State and Territory Government in Australia.\" The Aboriginal Child Placement Principle was formulated in Australia in the late 1970s and 1980s. Different child welfare legislation in each state and territory make it difficult to determine the effectiveness of the principle. \"[M]any Indigenous families prefer to make informal arrangements where possible for the care of children by extended family members. This distrust of the system is one of the reasons for the shortage of Indigenous carers in most jurisdictions in Australia.\"\n\nChild protection for aboriginal peoples of Canada has tended from Confederation in 1867 to fall between the chairs.\nConstitutional arrangements in Canada assigned \"Indians\" to federal and child protection to provincial authorities.\nSeveral generations of family life for many aboriginal peoples were devastated by a policy designed to \"kill the Indian in the child\" effectuated through a compulsory residential school program. In the 1960s, many aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families and adopted by non-aboriginal parents, in a process known as Sixties Scoop. In 1985, a Judge found that \"Cultural genocide has been taking place in a systematic routine manner.\" During the 1980s, \"First Nations peoples [took initiatives] in developing proposals of their own and in negotiating agreements with governments. ... First Nations peoples [developed] service models which reflect[ed] the experiences of their communities, cultures and histories.\" In 1982, aboriginal rights were protected in the Canadian Constitution. Developments in case law suggest that since 1982 aboriginal peoples' rights to cultural integrity have been constitutionally protected. Subsequently, some provinces enacted provisions and established policies for aboriginal child welfare agencies to provide services for aboriginal families on reserves under provincial law. They depend upon federal funding.\n\"Native agencies are bound by the same provincial child-welfare laws as their mainstream counterparts, but must survive on far tighter budgets under a strict federal funding formula that takes little account of provincial legislation.\" In 2007, the Assembly of First Nations announced that it was filing a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission that discriminatory services violated human rights. In 2008, Canada's Auditor General found that \"Current funding practices do not lead to equitable funding among Aboriginal and First Nations communities.\" Currently, \"The First Nations are engaged in a struggle to gain control of child welfare in their own communities, and this issue has a significant place in the First Nations movement towards self-determination.\" Indigenous peoples exercising the right of self-determination have yet to make it fully effective in respect of aboriginal child protection.\n\nChina has numerous indigenous peoples that are designated national ethnic minorities.\nChina is undergoing extraordinarily rapid economic growth and urbanization from a recent baseline of extreme poverty.\nProvincial, county and township governments have difficulty financing social services.\nIn these circumstances, \"The majority of protective children are [those who are] abandoned and disabled. ... It is almost unimaginable that [a] child will be moved from the birthfamily due to child abuse and neglect by his or her birthparent(s).\"\nA 2005 study sponsored by the All-China Women's Federation, UNICEF and Peking University and supported by the government of China found that child abuse is widespread in China.\nIn the absence of state intervention to protect children within their families, aboriginal child protection tends to not be an issue.\nEthnic minority families are exempted from the one-child policy, removing for ethnic minority populations one of the main reasons for child abandonment.\nIn China, “Every ethnic group has the freedom to use its own spoken and written languages, and to retain or change its customs. ... [N]ational minorities exercise regional autonomy.\nWhere national minorities live in compact communities autonomous organs of self-government are established…. The minority people … exercise autonomous rights, [are] masters in their own areas and administer the internal affairs of their ethnic group.\"\n\"Recent reform efforts in China's child welfare practices have focused on the importance of providing safe, permanent families for children in lieu of long-term institutional care. Although challenges still exist, adoption and foster care are increasingly being seen as viable alternatives for these children.\"\nThe combination of autonomous rights and absence of intrusive mainstream child protection services in China tends to defuse the principal driving forces underlying aboriginal child protection in other countries.\n\nIn New Zealand, social services established with the \"Child Welfare Act\" in 1925 \"displayed little regard for the extended kin networks of Māori children.\" In 1955, New Zealand law retroactively abolished Māori customary adoptions. In 1982, a report recommended changes to the Department of Social Welfare to meet Māori needs. \"The report's recommendations, all accepted by the then Minister, focus[ed] upon the need for the department to function in a bicultural manner and to share responsibility and authority for decisions with appropriate Māori people.\" By the late 1980s, \"notions of social work accountability, along with the pivotal role accorded family and whanau, had tipped the balance of care and protection work away from professionals. 'Family solutions to family problems', an important philosophy of child welfare work for many years, became more significant as family decision-making assumed importance.\" In 1989, New Zealand passed ground-breaking new legislation, based on a philosophy of kinship care, that recognized \"the importance of cultural identity in child protection policy.\" \"[K]inship care in New Zealand is ... an effort to redress past practices that harmed and alienated Māori children and families.\"\n\nHistorically, in the United States \"Indian tribes ... struggled against the assimilationist policies instituted by the United States which sought to destroy tribal cultures by removing Native American children from their tribes and families. In a stark example of such policies, the purpose articulated in the charter of the first boarding school in the 1890s on the Navajo reservation was 'to remove the Navajo child from the influence of his savage parents.'\" In the 1960s, the federal government embarked on a new federal Indian policy of tribal self-determination. \"In view of this new policy and the problems facing tribes as a result of the loss of their children, the \"Indian Child Welfare Act\" was enacted in 1978.\" Aboriginal child protection is now the subject of a body of federal law and programs. Through the Indian Health Service (IHS), the U.S. government provides \"health services to more than 1.8 million Federally-recognized American Indians and Alaska Natives through a system of IHS, tribal, and urban ... operated facilities and programs based on treaties, judicial determinations, and Acts of Congress.\" The IHS is \"the principal Federal health care provider and advocate for the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives\". As part of its services, the IHS administers the \"Indian Child Abuse and Family Violence Prevention Act\" and with the Bureau of Indian Affairs offers model tribal laws for child protection codes on reservation. These services, programs and codes may be culturally and linguistically as well as legally and politically differentiated from those of State-based Child Protective Services but, more generally, \"Kinship care has become an integral program option along the continuum of service options in the child welfare system.\"\n\nIn a democracy child protection is subject to the rule of law.\nMany countries have written laws governing the exercise of state power for child protection. Indigenous peoples had organized societies and customary laws.\nIndigenous peoples' customary laws are recognized and enforceable as part of the laws of post-colonial countries.\nIn the U.S.A., \"Customary law still appears in many of the decisions of American state and federal courts. Customary law, part and parcel of the English common law adopted and adapted by the Founders of the United States, recurs less often given that statutory and administrative law dominate the field. In contrast, the importance of customary law in American Indian tribal courts cannot be [over]stated.\"\nIn Canada, a court noted that \"such rules, whether they result from custom, tradition, agreement, or some other decision making process, are 'laws' in the Dicey constitutional sense.\"\nInevitably, political tensions over the exercise of self-determination by aboriginal peoples find expression in legal tensions between indigenous, customary laws and post-colonial statutes respecting child protection for aboriginal children.\nIndigenous legal principles that reflect a more holistic worldview, and so give relatively greater emphasis to spiritual, cultural and relational needs in addition to physical needs of the child, may add to the legal differences.\n\nAs aboriginal child protection returns to its roots among aboriginal peoples, the question of who is aboriginal becomes increasingly pertinent.\nAboriginal customs and colonial statutes were the two main sources of legal definitions of aboriginality. Aboriginal peoples were typically cohesive, numbering only hundreds or perhaps thousands, and collectively knew who they were.\nTheir customary self-definitions may have been cultural rather than racial because some interbreeding was important for healthy genetic diversity.\nColonial statutes were generally based on race or place.\nToday, the challenges of definition span a range from New Zealand's with one officially recognized ethnic minority to China's with 55.\nIn Australia and Canada, where for jurisdictional reasons child protection laws affecting aboriginal families vary across states and provinces, availability of aboriginal child protection services tends to be defined by place.\n\nIn Australia, \"In his analysis of over 700 pieces of legislation, the legal historian John McCorquodale found no less than 67 different definitions of Aboriginal people.\"\n\nThree constitutionally undefined groups of aboriginal peoples have constitutional rights in Canada.\nOf these, only \"Indians\" are statutorily defined for administrative purposes and the statutory Band scheme does not correspond with Indian peoples.\nFrom its inception in 1876, the \"Indian Act\" established convoluted but essentially patrilineal definitions of \"Indian\", an exercise in gender discrimination that was eroded and finally eliminated by court decisions and statutory amendments in the 25 years following the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nIn general, aboriginal peoples in Canada continue to have the right to define themselves for their own purposes and such definitions may have wider application.\nIn 1999, Pimicikamak, a Canadian aboriginal people, enacted a citizenship law based on self-identification, acceptance by the people, and objective verifiability.\nIn 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada prescribed three similar criteria for determining who is a member of a Métis people, reflecting the customary aboriginal definition (with the addition of objective verifiability, which was not an issue in the pre-colonial context).\n\nIn China, distinct ethnic groups have been officially defined since 1949. The criteria for recognition of an ethnic group are: a territory in China from which it originated, a distinct language, distinctive customs and a sense of collective identity.\n\n\"The Waitangi Tribunal was established in 1975 by the \"Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975\". The Tribunal is a permanent commission of inquiry charged with making recommendations on claims brought by Māori relating to actions or omissions of the Crown that breach the promises made in the Treaty of Waitangi.\"\n\nExcept where mandated and provided distinctly from mainstream child protection, aboriginal child protection is necessarily provided through some form of bicultural services. This gives rise to issues of cultural competence.\n\nWhile constitutional arrangements, legal definitions and statutory schemata vary among those Western post-colonial countries where aboriginal child protection issues have most notably emerged, standards for aboriginal child protection tend to converge. Whether mainstream or aboriginal, child protection agencies tend to be professional and to aim for best practice standards. Best practice is implicit in identifying the best interests of the child, the almost universal mantra of modern child welfare statutory mandates and professional practice. Best practice is evidence based; knowledge of the evidence accepts no borders.\n"}

He is of Austrian-Jewish and Polish-Jewish/Austrian descent through his grandparents who fled to the United States before The Holocaust. Weinman's family was not actively observant but he grew up \"with a real appreciation of the culture of Judaism\". He was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) as a child. Weinman also suffered from bullying at the time. He later stated that \"music saved his life\" because it helped him to discover new ways of learning, make friends and it gave him a sense of purpose.\n\nWeinman attended Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, New Jersey where he first received a degree in psychology in 2000 and then in corporate communications, a field in which he worked for some time afterwards at a web company.\n\nWeinman played in some bands from New Jersey and in 1996 he founded the hardcore punk act Arcane along with Chris Pennie on drums, Dimitri Minakakis on vocals, Bruce Fulton on bass and Brad McMannand on second vocals. He describes the group as a \"lost cause\" due to their lack of innovation. After a few months, they turned around its style, with Adam Doll replacing McMann and Derek Brantley taking the place of Fulton. Eventually, Arcane morphed into the Dillinger Escape Plan in 1997.

{"id": "26992563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26992563", "title": "Chris Jarvis (rower)", "text": "Chris Jarvis (rower)\n\nChris Jarvis (born 1980) is a Canadian rower. He was born in Burlington, Ontario and competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens Greece. He is the founder of a Canada-based charity known as \"I Challenge Diabetes\" and provides significant grass roots support to the Canadian Public.\n\nJarvis was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1 at age 13. He wears a Meditronic insulin pump while competing, in order to mitigate the effects of his condition. When he was rowing in college at Northeastern University, his coach told him that the diabetes would prevent him from ever rowing for the varsity team. Despite this, Jarvis not only made the team, but was also selected as its captain in his senior year. He went on to race for Canada for eight years including racing at the Olympics, winning gold medals and podium finishes for many world stage events and is a reputable leader of non-profit work in diabetes.\n\nJarvis has taken his passion for sports, coaching principles and his knowledge of the science behind diabetes and built a charity the Globe and Mail says \"helps people take control of their diabetes while challenging themselves physically\" - Inspire, Globe and Mail, Nov 18th, 2011 by Marjo Johne. Jarvis and a team of community leaders take on activities from basic community programs to the most extreme races Canada has to offer. Director of a diabetes youth expedition, in 2006, Jarvis took teens to Peru to find \"diabetes maturity\". In 2011 Jarvis' team ran over 40 not-for profit programs with over 1500 participants. A direct focus still remains on teens in transition with diabetes however I Challenge Diabetes is running programs for all ages. Jarvis feels there is an extreme gap in the system that leaves these teens overburdened and in need of support. A similar position he found himself in and feels grateful for the sport that forced his growth and the luck he had to find stability on his own. As such, Jarvis' team continues to strive forward as leaders of social and educational support for all peoples, building community and sharing insight with a particular focus on teens with diabetes. Programs currently span the provinces of BC, AB, ON and QC however participants have been known to travel from other provinces and even other countries.\n\nRowing and not-for-profit back ground\n\nDespite challenges from University coach, Jarvis determined to reach his potential pushed hard to succeed. Leaping beyond the boundaries of University rowing he quickly realized his potential on Canada's national rowing team. Bringing home Silver in 2002 from the under 23 world rowing championships he returned to University to make a difference. While studying chemical engineering and practicing the maximum number of hours in NCAA legislature, Jarvis found the time to join the universities \"Student Athlete Advisory Committee\" (SAAC) and over his four year career spent two years as the university co-chair of SAAC bringing in new initiatives for athletes to engage in the community. Jarvis was quickly recruited to represent the Universities Conference as the America East Chair of SAAC where he learned and developed as a leader in sport in the community.\nReturning to train in 2003 Jarvis began training for Athens and supported his team mates to an undefeated rowing streak that was 17 races long for Canada. The final World Cup circuit before Athens Greece Jarvis was in the eight and concluded the final six race circuit with an impressive win in Lucerne Switzerland against the entire field that would be racing in Athens. With five weeks remaining before the Olympics a shift in the team moved Jarvis and Barber out of the eight, Jarvis joining Dave Calder in the pair who showed promise for Athens. With little time to train and synchronize, there was an unprecedented amount of speed out of the gates and down the course with Jarvis and Calder moving straight on to the Semi-final from the opening heats in the Olympics and taking down a serious medal contender, the Skelin brothers who had been training together for 17+ years.\n\nBoth Jarvis and rower Dave Calder were disqualified during the Semi-final after a near flawless race just after qualifying the pair for the grand final in striking distance of a podium finish. The pair was accused of striking the South African team after crossing over the line of buoys in the final 60m of their 2000m race. The pair appealed the disqualification to FISA, the governing body, the officials refused to look at any evidence and their appeal was not successful. After this disappointment, the pair continued to dispute this to the court of Arbitration of Sport, where a video was finally brought forward from the Olympic Committee showing no such evidence of Canada touching the South African pair. The Canadian Pair also had a signed petition from the other athletes qualified for the Grand Final stating their acceptance to the appeal and asking for Canada to be included in the race. The only pair of the six who did not sign the petition was strangely not the South African pair, but the Australians who had beaten all other crews but the Canadians in previous races. The Court saw that Canada had not struck the South African pair and the Canadians were permitted to return to racing however the decision was made too late and the Canadians were ranked 12th overall without a final race.\n\nJarvis has teamed up with other athletes to race the pair since. In the following year after Athens, 2005 Jarvis raced with partner Malcolm Howard to claim the highest percentage in Canada while qualifying for the World Rowing Championships in Gifu Japan. An irritation in Jarvis' lower back emerged to two bulging discs during the travel to Japan and left Jarvis and Howard with little time to for rehabilitation. Howard decided to remain with his partner Jarvis and the pair managed to pull off a 4th-place finish despite the setback. Nearly edging in for a bronze in the closing meters of the race but ran out of room. Since 2004, Jarvis realized his impact on the community of people living with diabetes. A disease he had lived with since 1994 and had served as an extra challenge mentally, physically and financially throughout every day of his training career. Jarvis became an advocate for others with the disease and began building a community in both Canada and the US as a spokesperson, educator and inspiration. Jarvis partnered with fellow diabetic athlete Peter Nerothin, co-founding Insulindependence. This was done in 2005 while competing on the Canadian team and finishing his degree at Northeastern University in Boston.\n\nOnce completing his degree in Chemical Engineering, 2006, Jarvis returned to Canada causing Nerothin and Jarvis to separate paths to start anew in Canada. Jarvis started another organization in Canada called \"I Challenge Diabetes\" while he continued training. Earning immediate recognition in Canada, Jarvis was given a first time award by the Canadian DIabetes Association with they called the \"National Inspiration Award\" given to someone effecting the whole countries community with diabetes. Jarvis paired up with Dan Casaca in 2007 to lead the Canadian team to its first gold medal in coxless pairs while 2007 Pan American Games. This was Canada's only gold in the 2007 games for Canada's Rowing Team and the first Gold for Canada of the games. Globe and Mail\n\nJarvis split commitment to the not-for-profit world of both rowing and diabetes ended up costing him big. On top of the 6–8 hours of training per day, 18 training sessions per week (with growing intensity as Beijing drew near), he also poured his passion into the diabetes community in Canada and tried to remain connected to the US community he had built. Emails came in from parents of children with diabetes and diabetic athletes from around the world, plus squeezing in over 75 speaking events in 2007 alone - Jarvis was stretched thin. In the peak of the racing season, Jarvis was pulled from a team meeting by the team manager to inform him of a \"whereabouts failure\". As Jarvis was one of the five members of the Olympic rowing team selected for a new focused initiative to track the whereabouts of the worlds top athletes, to insure at any time a spot check on banned substance abuse could be possible, he needed to submit proper documentation to the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport - a task he neglected to comply with. Jarvis was required to submit daily activities, time and locations 30–120 days in advance to comply with this legislation. This was something that all Canadian elite athletes were required to do. Jarvis was unable to manage his email stream and had missed two emails from the CCES who had faulted him with inadequate information and given 2 warnings.\n\nJarvis now aware of the problem wrote to the CCES and asked if there was any other means, a simple request for the use of the phone, to deal with such important information as emails can easily be lost in the shuffle of an athlete who burns 7000 Calories a day in training. This is a part of the legislation that insists all efforts are made to insure the athlete is aware of their responsibility to report, regardless, the CCES again decided to use email for another important update request while Jarvis was inaccessible to the internet. Upon returning home and shuffling through emails to find he was one day after the deadline, Jarvis placed an urgent call to the CCES, asking for assistance and for mercy.\n\nClaiming that he had been found easily each time he was sought by CCES officers for testing and tested more often than any other team mate in 2007, the accusations were simply blind siding. Regardless Jarvis was suspended for three months from the Canadian rowing team as a result of repeatedly neglecting to report his whereabouts to the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport. Although a tribunal found that there was significant neglect of obligations by the CCES case manager and the team manager, the tribunal could not overturn the decision of the CCES who maintained their position. Within the current system there were no repercussions or adjustments for failure. Jarvis returned to row and fought for a spot with the Canadian Olympic Team. While politics played a part as the team needed to be narrowed significantly before Beijing, the nation's best petitioned the coaches to include him and Jarvis was brought overseas to train with the team right up to the games. Jarvis' hope in racing in the Olympic Games was satisfied in part by seeing his team mates win Gold and Silver in the men's eight and pair respectively.\n\nHe has since retired from rowing and continues to pursue his not-for-profit initiatives which keep him plenty active.\n\n"}

His designs include a three-stage rocket and a manned rocket.\n\nHaas was perhaps born in Dornbach (now part of Hernals, Vienna). \nHe held the post of the \"Zeugwart\" (arsenal master) of the Imperial Austrian army under Ferdinand I. \nIn 1551, Stephen Báthory, the grand prince of Transylvania invited Haas to Hermannstadt, Siebenbürgen (now Sibiu, Transylvania, Romania), where he acted as weapons engineer and also he started to teach at Klausenburg (now Cluj-Napoca).\n\nHe wrote a German-language treatise on rocket technology, involving the combination of fireworks and weapons technologies. This manuscript was discovered in 1961, in the Sibiu public records (Sibiu public records \"Varia II 374\").\nHis work also dealt with the theory of motion of multi-stage rockets, different fuel mixtures using liquid fuel, and introduced delta-shape fins and bell-shaped nozzles.\n\nIn the last paragraph of his chapter on the military use of rockets, he wrote (translated):\n\"But my advice is for more peace and no war, leaving the rifles calmly in storage, so the bullet is not fired, the gunpowder is not burned or wet, so the prince keeps his money, the arsenal master his life; that is the advice Conrad Haas gives.\"\n\nJohann Schmidlap, a German fireworks maker, is believed to have experimented with staging in 1590, using a design he called \"step rockets.\"\nBefore discovery of Haas' manuscript, the first description of the three-stage rocket was in Poland credited to the Polish artillery specialist Kazimierz Siemienowicz in his 1650 work, \"Artis Magnae Artilleriae Pars Prima\" (\"Great Art of Artillery, Part One\").\n\n"}

Gibson released her debut album \"Out of the Blue\" in 1987, which spawned several international hits, later being certified triple Platinum by the RIAA. One of those singles, \"Foolish Beat\", made Gibson the youngest female artist to write, produce and perform a \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number-one single. Her double-platinum second album \"Electric Youth\" (1989), gave Gibson another U.S. number-one hit with \"Lost in Your Eyes\". Gibson is the sole songwriter on all of her singles to reach the Top 20 of the Hot 100 charts. She was recognized by ASCAP as Songwriter of the Year, along with Bruce Springsteen, in 1989. She continued to record and release music throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In 2006, Gibson reached No. 24 on the U.S. adult contemporary chart with \"Say Goodbye\", a duet with Jordan Knight and in 2017 achieved her highest-charting hit in more than 25 years in her duet with Sir Ivan, 'I Am Peaceman'.\n\nIn addition to music, she has gone on to starring roles on Broadway and touring musicals including playing Eponine in \"Les Misérables\" and Sandy in \"Grease\", as well as independent film and television work.\n\nDebbie Gibson was born in Brooklyn, New York, the third daughter of four of Joseph Gibson and Diane Gibson (née Pustizzi). Her father, who enjoyed singing, was originally named Joseph Schultz and was orphaned as a boy; his biological mother married a man with the surname Gibson before putting Joseph into an orphanage. Debbie Gibson grew up in suburban Merrick, New York, on Long Island. She describes herself as of \"Italian/Sicilian and part German and possibly some Russian\" descent. She studied piano under American pianist Morton Estrin.\n\nAfter years of writing and producing her own material, Gibson finally found her demo in the hands of a radio personality who eventually shared it with an executive at Atlantic Records. Based solely on Gibson's original song, \"Only in My Dreams\", she was signed to a development deal and began a promotional tour of club venues throughout the United States.\n\nGibson spent much of 1986 and the beginning of 1987 building her songwriting catalog while continuing to play club dates. Continuing her promotional tour, Gibson also continued attending classes at Calhoun High School in Merrick, New York, whence she later graduated as an honor student. Diane Gibson, Debbie's mother and manager, accompanied her daughter on many of these track dates. \"We played dance clubs, straight clubs and gay clubs\", Diane has said.\n\nThe promotional pressing of \"Only in My Dreams\" landed the song within the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Atlantic Records signed Gibson to a recording contract and thus began the process of completing the first record.\n\nGibson, along with producer Fred Zarr, wrote, recorded and produced her first album \"Out of the Blue\" in only 4 weeks. Now having something to market, \"Only in My Dreams\" was selected as Debbie's first single. This time, \"Dreams\" found traction on Top 40 radio and reached a peak of No. 4 on the Hot 100 chart.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Dreams\", \"Shake Your Love\" was released as the follow-up single and reached the \"Billboard\" Top 5. The \"Shake Your Love\" video was choreographed by Paula Abdul and was the first time MTV had visited Debbie on a video shoot.\n\nIn 1987, while performing around the United States at nightclub venues, Gibson was recording her debut album, \"Out of the Blue\". It was recorded in four weeks. Four singles from the album reached the Top 5 of the Hot 100 chart: \"Only in My Dreams\", \"Shake Your Love\", \"Out of the Blue\", and the number-one hit \"Foolish Beat\", followed by \"Staying Together\", which performed more modestly, reaching No. 22. \"Foolish Beat\" set a record for Gibson, making her (at 17) the youngest artist ever to have written, produced, and performed a \"Billboard\" number-one single, as entered in the 1988 Guinness Book of World Records. She remains the youngest female artist to have done so. \"Out of the Blue\" was established as a hit album and she had success in the UK and southeast Asia, filling stadiums with her \"Out of the Blue\" tour. By the end of 1988, \"Out of the Blue\" had gone triple platinum.\n\nThe \"Out of the Blue\" music video compilation was certified platinum by the RIAA; the concert tour video was certified 2x platinum. In October 1988, Gibson sang the national anthem for Game 1 of the Major League Baseball World Series.\n\n\"Electric Youth\" was released in early 1989, and spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Top 200 Album chart. The first single released, \"Lost in Your Eyes\", was No. 1 on the Hot 100 for three weeks, garnering her another achievement as the first female to have both an album and single simultaneously at No. 1. (She shared the 1989 ASCAP Songwriter of the Year Award with Bruce Springsteen.) Subsequent singles from the album were \"Electric Youth\" (No. 11), \"No More Rhyme\" (No. 17), and \"We Could Be Together\" (No. 71). The \"Electric Youth\" album was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA. The successful \"Electric Youth\" world tour and \"Live Around the World\" VHS (2x platinum) followed. In 1988, Debbie sang \"Don't Flirt with Me\".\n\nIn tandem with the second album, she created a perfume called Electric Youth that was distributed by Revlon, and other makeup essentials for young girls that were distributed nationwide through Natural Wonder Cosmetics. Debbie's trademark was her hats, usually a black pork pie style. She also made popular wearing tight, rolled-up jeans, vests over a T-shirt, friendship bracelets and two Swatch watches as on the back cover of her popular \"Electric Youth\" album and in her \"Staying Together\" music video. Her influences were Madonna and Olivia Newton-John, though she has often stated she admires Elton John and Billy Joel as favorite artists and was asked and did sing and perform live with Billy Joel and John at Elton John's Madison Square Garden show. She appeared on the covers of numerous teen magazines such as \"Tiger Beat\".\n\nShe recorded two more albums for Atlantic Records: \"Anything Is Possible\" (1990) and \"Body Mind Soul\" (1993). \"Anything Is Possible\", co-written with Motown mainstay Lamont Dozier, peaked at No. 26 on \"Billboard\"'s Hot 100 in 1991. Subsequent singles from \"Anything Is Possible\" failed to chart on the Hot 100, although \"One Step Ahead\" scored on the Hot Maxi Singles and Hot Dance charts, peaking at No. 21 and No. 18 respectively. \"Body Mind Soul\" spawned another minor hit in \"Losin' Myself\", which was accompanied by a controversial video clip, which Matthew Rolston directed, that featured Gibson as a stripper. The second single from the album, \"Shock Your Mama\", became a minor hit in Europe and the UK, however \"Losin' Myself\" was Debbie Gibson's last appearance on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nDuring this time, Gibson was part of the supergroup that recorded the charity single \"Voices That Care\" which peaked at No. 11 on the Hot 100 chart.\n\nIn 1995, she signed with EMI's SBK Records division and recorded her only album for the label, \"Think With Your Heart.\" It was an Adult contemporary-heavy album consisting of piano and keyboard ballads recorded predominantly with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The album's producer, Niko Bolas, who was usually Neil Young's co-producer, was producing the reunion album for veteran punk band Circle Jerks, and invited Gibson to a recording session for that band's album. She sang background vocals on the song \"I Wanna Destroy You\", as well as appearing at and participating in the Circle Jerks' performance at punk venue CBGB, wearing one of the band's T-shirts and sharing a microphone with frontman Keith Morris.\n\nIn 1998, she sang the song, \"I Do\", which is featured on the soundtrack to the film, \"The Naked Man\". The lyrics to the song were composed by the co-writer of the film, Ethan Coen. The soundtrack has never been released.\n\nAfter parting company with EMI, Gibson formed her own record label, Espiritu, to release her original material. Her sixth album, \"Deborah\" (1996), marked her full return to pop. \"Deborah\" includes the lead single \"Only Words\". \"Only Words\" (Dance Edit) became a Top 40 Hot Dance Music/Club Play hit. The album's other single was the ballad, \"Naturally\". Though it only sold 20,000 in the US, \"Deborah\" remains well-respected. \n\nIn 2001, she released her seventh album on her new record label, Golden Egg, titled \"M.Y.O.B.\"---i.e. Mind Your Own Business. It featured three singles: the sensual pop song \"What You Want\", the Latin-infused Dance-pop song \"Your Secret\", and the bass heavy \"M.Y.O.B.\" Highlights from the album include the sultry Latin-flavored smooth jazz song \"In Blue\", a vintage style ballad \"Wishing You Were Here\", \"Jaded\", and a remix of \"M.Y.O.B.\" with the background vocals of her two nieces.\n\nIn 2005, Gibson co-wrote and recorded a song titled \"Someone You Love\" with the O'Neill Brothers. With the O'Neill Brothers, she released an updated, acoustic version of her number-one hit \"Lost in Your Eyes\". There was an Emmy-nominated PBS special in 2005.\n\nShe had a resurgence of popularity in niche markets. Her single \"Your Secret\" came back from its dormant state and became popular on some radio stations including Super 91.7 WMPH in Wilmington, Delaware. \"Your Secret\" has been on their request show, \"Total Control Radio\", for 12 months; it reached No. 1 on its third week on that station's chart in May 2006. It charted along with a few of her other singles, \"M.Y.O.B.\" and \"Only Words\" (Dance Edit), the Eurodance mix. They all have become recurrent hits on WMPH.\n\nThe March 2005 issue of \"Playboy\" featured a nude pictorial of Gibson, coinciding with the release of her single, \"Naked\". She has said that the magazine had asked her five times to pose for them since she turned 18. She agreed to pose in an effort to revamp her image, describing how one casting call called her agent, not realizing that Gibson had long since outgrown her teenage image. The single peaked at No. 35 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Single Sales chart in March 2005.\n\nIn November 2005, it was announced that Debbie would go on tour with The O'Neill Brothers for \"Someone You Love Tour\" in 2006. \"Lost in Your Eyes\" was revamped with an acoustic sound and a song \"Someone You Love\" was written and performed by Debbie and The O'Neill Brothers. These two songs also appeared on The O'Neill Brothers album \"Someone You Love\".\n\nThe 2006 single, \"Say Goodbye\", featuring dance-pop artist Jordan Knight, made an impression in the Soft AC and Hot AC radio formats, becoming the third-most added single during summer, 2006. It debuted at No. 35 on the Hot Contemporary chart, peaking at No. 24 in early September. The same year, Gibson appeared in the independent film \"Coffee Date\" with Wilson Cruz and Jonathan Silverman and provided a soundtrack song called \"Sounds Like Love\".\n\nOn November 14, 2006, Gibson released the song \"Famous\" on her official website. The song was written by Gibson and Tiziano Lugli, and was produced by Lugli.\n\nIn May 2007, the world premiere of \"Electric Youth: The Musical\" was unveiled at The Starlight Theatre in Orlando, Florida. The musical featured 14 of Gibson's songs and was directed by Dean Parker.\n\nIn September 2007, Gibson considered creating a camp on the West Coast. She is the founder and creator of Camp Electric Youth, a children's summer day camp which ran from July 7–18, 2008. It claims to be the first camp of its kind in the Los Angeles area. The camp was reportedly attended by \"over 120 talented singers, actors and dancers\" from around the world.\n\nGibson was a judge for the online talent competition, Total Pop Star, along with Andrew Van Slee (producer and judge), and Joey Lawrence (from \"Blossom\"). The first season ran from Nov 12, 2007 – May 30, 2008, though it was later extended to June. The show ended abruptly during the 2nd season.\n\nIn January 2008, Gibson announced that she would revive and perform her 1980s hits—along with her Broadway role songs—during a three-run week in May 2008 at Harrah's in Atlantic City.\nShe later appeared on the April 2008 cover of \"Lavender Magazine\" (a GLBT magazine in Minnesota) and was interviewed about her career and upcoming projects. Then on the 24th, Gibson hosted and performed on Spotlightlive '80s Karaoke Experience in New York singing songs such as \"Only in My Dreams\", \"Out of the Blue\", \"Love Shack\" (an original hit for the B-52's) and \"9 to 5\". She performed with Samantha Fox, Tiffany, & Rick Astley at the Colisée Pepsi in Quebec City, Canada on April 10, 2009.\n\nOn March 5, 2009, Gibson announced via YouTube video blog that she would be releasing a new song/video called \"Already Gone\". Released on her official website and reverberation, the song was released first on March 9, 2009, then the video on March 13, 2009. The song was written by Gibson and produced by Fred Coury.

On the fourth task, she won $50,000 for her charity, Children International. Gibson was fired on April 1, 2012 in the seventh task because she had brought in the least amount of money between her teammates in the boardroom, Dayana Mendoza and Teresa Giudice. While both Mendoza and Giudice were arguably weaker candidates going forward, given that Mendoza was cited as the women's weakest link and Giudice had failed the task as project manager, Gibson was fired instead.\n\nOn September 6, 2017, Gibson was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on the 25th season of \"Dancing with the Stars\". She was paired with first time pro-dancer, Alan Bersten. On September 26, 2017, Gibson and Bersten were the second couple eliminated coming in 12th place.\n\nOver the years, Gibson has been the target of stalkers. Robert Bardo, who was convicted for murdering actress Rebecca Schaeffer in 1989, had a wall in his house adorned with pictures of Gibson and Tiffany. In May 1998, Michael Falkner, a disgruntled fan from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, was arrested outside Manhattan's Palace Theater, where Gibson was performing in the live musical adaptation of Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\". This was after Gibson received threatening letters, emails and faxes from Falkner, who used the alias 'Starcade'. In 2008, Gibson filed for a restraining order against Spanish taxi driver Jorge Puigdollers, who had stalked her since 2002. However, a temporary restraining order was not issued by the court, and a court date was set to determine if a restraining order was appropriate in the matter. The proceeding was dismissed when Gibson failed to show up at the courthouse for the hearing to present her case.\n\nGibson was once engaged to Jonathan Kanterman and has been in a long-term relationship since 2008 with Rutledge Taylor.\n\nGibson has been battling Lyme disease since early 2013.\n\nIn 2016, she appeared on \"\", where she spoke out about her drug use in the past, after the death of singer Prince:\n\nI really feel like I haven't fully articulated it till now and really spoke candidly till now... When I heard the news about Prince and the fact that it might have been prescription drug-related, I really had a moment of, like, \"That's awful and that's sad — and I can relate.\" And, unfortunately, 90 percent of the entertainment community can relate. I remember being on the road at, like, 25, touring with theater and doing my own cocktail of Tylenol PM and Xanax. It's like, \"Oh, I found a way to make the Xanax last longer with the Tylenol PM. I mean, it's as simple as that, and that is how performers get in so much trouble.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He is a clown (or evil clown) wearing traditional clown makeup (or a mask decorated to resemble such) and brightly colored clothes. Originally portrayed by professional wrestler Matt Osborne, Doink has since been portrayed by many other wrestlers both in the WWF (now WWE) and on the independent circuit.\n\nFormer WWE producer Bruce Prichard said in an interview on \"The Steve Austin Show\" that Michael Hegstrand had originally conceived the idea of a miserable clown character.\n\nAfter making appearances in late 1992 in the crowd and at ringside, playing tricks on the fans and wrestlers, the Doink character made his in-ring debut in the WWF in 1993, originally wrestling as a technically sound heel. Doink played cruel jokes on both fans and wrestlers in order to amuse himself and put them off guard. Some of his villainous pranks included tripping Big Boss Man with a tripwire, dumping water on Marty Jannetty and attacking Crush with a loaded prosthetic arm. He clashed with Crush at WrestleMania IX, a match which he won after the appearance of an identical Doink (played by Steve Keirn) from underneath the ring. Doink also wrestled Randy Savage on \"Monday Night Raw\", and substituted for Jerry Lawler, who faked an injury, against Bret Hart at SummerSlam in 1993.\n\nDoink then turned on Lawler on the September 4 episode of \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\" in Lawler's The King's Court segment, making Burger King jokes to amuse the crowd and eventually emptied a bucket of water over Lawler. Matt Osborne, the original man behind Doink, was fired for re-occurring drug abuses, eventually leaving the gimmick (after bouncing through a few others) to Ray Licameli (also known as Ray Apollo). Now as a fan favorite and with a new midget sidekick Dink, Doink was more of a comic relief character, but continued to pull pranks on other wrestlers (albeit more harmless and silly than outright cruel), mostly on heels like Lawler and Bobby Heenan. Doink and Dink also battled with Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon in a feud that culminated at WrestleMania X. Doink would later encounter Jerry Lawler again in a match at Survivor Series. In this match, Doink and Dink teamed with Wink and Pink to meet Lawler's dwarf team of 'little kings' Queazy, Cheezy, and Sleazy. Eventually, Doink became a jobber, regularly losing to wrestlers like Jeff Jarrett, Hakushi, Waylon Mercy and, in his final televised match in September 1995, to Hunter Hearst Helmsley. Doink reemerged one last time in 1997 at the Slammy Awards and was attacked by Stone Cold Steve Austin, amidst crowd chants of \"kill the clown\".\n\nDoink (Matt Osborne) also had a few matches in 1994 in southeast Michigan. He faced off against Bastion Booger on July 14, 1994, in Port Huron, Michigan. He also wrestled alongside some other now known names such as Al Snow and Terry Funk when wrestling for MTW.\n\nFollowing his departure from the WWF, Osborne appeared (as Matt Borne) in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) for several matches as Doink in a blue and green clown suit, setting up an angle where ECW champion Shane Douglas criticized Vince McMahon for turning a talented wrestler like Borne into a comic relief character, and claimed that he knew how to bring out Borne's full potential. Borne then made a few appearances with Douglas as \"himself\", sporting his face half-painted with the Doink makeup. His attitude insinuated that he had developed borderline personality disorder from having been forced to wrestle as a clown; after winning matches he would dress his opponent in clown accessories to humiliate them. His ring name under this gimmick was \"Borne Again\".\n\nSince 1997, Doink has appeared sporadically in WWE. Ray Apollo returned to play him in the Gimmick Battle Royal at WrestleMania X-Seven. On December 10, 2007, Doink played by Matt Borne participated in a battle royal of 15 WWE alumni for the \"Raw\" 15th anniversary special episode.\n\nPlayed by Nick Dinsmore, he showed up in the A.P.A. Bar Room Brawl at Vengeance in 2003. He was selected by Rhino to face Chris Benoit on the July 31, 2003 \"Smackdown!\".\n\nPlayed by Steve Lombardi, he wrestled Rob Conway on an October 2005 episode of \"Raw\". On June 2, 2007, Doink, Eugene and Kane defeated Umaga, Viscera and Kevin Thorn on the 34th edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". On the July 12, 2010 \"Raw\", Doink teamed with William Regal, Primo and Zack Ryder to lose to Santino Marella, Goldust, Vladimir Kozlov and The Great Khali, when he was pinned by Khali. On the July 2, 2012 \"Raw\", he made a surprise return and lost to Heath Slater. He reappeared on July 23, alongside several other WWE alumni, to help Lita take down Slater on \"WWE Raw 1000\", the one thousandth episode of \"Raw\".\n\nIn early 2010, Osborne reinvented the Doink character to resemble Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in \"The Dark Knight\", nicknaming the incarnation 'Reborne Again'. The new character debuted on March 27 for ISPW in New Jersey. On May 23, 2010, Doink the Clown, portrayed by Dusty Wolfe, interfered against Skandor Akbar and his men Dr. Knuckles and Rommel. This caused them to lose the Wrecking Ball Wrestling tag titles. In retaliation Akbar called on the original Doink Matt Borne. Wolfe and Borne were scheduled to meet on August 15, Wolfe would later no show the event. On August 8, 2010, Borne, as Doink the Clown, won the Wrecking Ball Wrestling Championship.\n\n\nDoink is a playable character in Acclaim's 1994 video game, \"WWF Raw\", Midway's \"\" (1995), and SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 (2008) (as a DLC character).\n\n\n\n"}

Finis and Wallace Carewe were enrolled members of the Chickasaw Nation. He was likely the most prolific of Native American directors of feature films in Hollywood history.\n\nAfter brief studies at the Universities of Texas and Missouri and a period of work with regional theatrical groups, Carewe moved to New York City in 1910, where he became a member of the Dearborn Stock Company. Although Jay Fox was his given name, Carewe chose Edwin (from stage actor Edwin Booth) and Carewe from a character he was playing. \n\nCarewe was on stage as an actor before he worked for Lubin studios. Later, he directed films for MGM, First National, Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, and United Artists. During his career, he provided early screen exposure to many actors such as Dolores del Río, Warner Baxter, Francis X. Bushman and Gary Cooper. He directed 58 films including the acclaimed 1928 version of \"Ramona\" starring Dolores del Río and Warner Baxter, which was rediscovered and restored by the Library of Congress and had its world premiere at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2014.\n\nCarewe and his two brothers, Wallace Fox (a director/producer) and Finis Fox (a scenario writer), were all registered Chickasaw according to the 1907 Chickasaw Rolls.\n\nAnother of Carewe's notable films was \"Evangeline\" in 1929 also with Dolores del Río and written by his brother Finis Fox. \"Evangeline\" was based upon the poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and earned praise for its exceptional lighting and camera work.\n\nAlthough Carewe directed and produced a number of critically and financially successful pictures during the silent era, he was not fully able to make the transition to sound. After resorting to sound remakes of his earlier successes, and later to low-budget and religious films, he made his last feature \"Are We Civilized?\" in 1934. \n\nCarewe was married three times, twice to actress Mary Akin. By his first wife, Mary Jane Croft (married 9 January 1909 in Toronto, Ontario), he had two daughters, Violette and Mary Jane. During his first marriage to his second wife, Mary Akin, he had two children, Sally Ann and William (born Edwin Gilbert).

He was arrested in 1841 for necrophilia and jailed for one year. In 1856, he moved to Le Havre. In his later life, he worked as clerk, mailman, and lighthouse keeper. He died on 25 February 1878.\n\nAccording to his birth certificate, Bertrand was born on 29 October 1823 in Voisey, Haute-Marne. Bertrand began dissecting dead cats and dogs early in life. He stated that his necrophilic impulses began in 1846, and were accompanied by headaches and heart palpitations. He progressed to exhuming the corpses of both women and men from graveyards, whereupon he would eviscerate and dismember them before masturbating. Bertrand would later describe his experience with the corpse of a 16-year-old girl:\n\nI covered it with kisses and pressed it wildly to my heart. All that one could enjoy with a living woman is nothing in comparison with the pleasure I experienced. After I had enjoyed it for about a quarter of an hour, I cut the body up, as usual, and tore out the entrails. Then I buried the cadaver again.\n\nBetween summer 1848 and March 1849, a series of bodies were exhumed and found severely mutilated in cemeteries of Paris. On 15 March 1849 Bertrand admitted himself to the Val-de-Grâce with gunshot wounds. A gravedigger at Montparnasse Cemetery overheard the news about Bertrand's injury, and realized that he must be the same person hit by his colleague's booby trap. (A different source states that Bertrand was wounded by a police bullet at the cemetery.) One of Bertrand's surgeons obtained a full confession. Bertrand was arrested and sentenced to one year in jail.\n\nBertrand's case prompted Joseph Guislain to coin the term 'necrophilia'. He was also discussed extensively by other early theorists of necrophilia, including Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis.\n"}

{"id": "2435723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2435723", "title": "Immortal Beloved", "text": "Immortal Beloved\n\nThe Immortal Beloved (German \"Unsterbliche Geliebte\") is the mysterious addressee of a love letter which composer Ludwig van Beethoven wrote on 6–7 July 1812 in Teplitz. The entire letter is written on 10 small pages, in Beethoven's rather inconsistent handwriting. The apparently unsent letter was found in the composer's estate after his death, after which it remained in the hands of Anton Schindler until his death, was subsequently willed to his sister, and was sold by her in 1880 to the Berlin State Library, where it remains today. The letter is written in pencil and consists of three parts.\n\nSince Beethoven did not specify a year, or a location, an exact dating of the letter and identification of the addressee was speculative until the 1950s, when an analysis of the paper's watermark yielded the year, and by extension the place. Scholars have since this time been divided on the intended recipient of the Immortal Beloved letter. The two candidates favored by most contemporary scholars are Antonie Brentano and Josephine Brunsvik. Other candidates who have been conjectured, with various degrees of mainstream scholarly support, are Julie (\"Giulietta\") Guicciardi, Therese Brunsvik, , Dorothea von Ertmann, Therese Malfatti, , Bettina von Arnim, and several others.\n\nAfter Schmidt-Görg (1957) published 13 then-unknown love letters by Beethoven to Josephine Brunsvik, it became clear that the one to the \"Immortal Beloved\" was not the only love letter authored by him. That Josephine could have been the unknown woman was subsequently suggested by analyses of similarities in wordings and phrases between earlier letters (from 1804 to 1809) and this mysterious one from 1812, mainly in the monographs by Massin (1955, 1970), Goldschmidt (1980) and Tellenbach (1983, p. 103 f.):\n\n\nIn his biography of Beethoven, Schindler (1840) named Julie (\"Giulietta\") Guicciardi as the \"Immortal Beloved\". But research by Tellenbach (1983) indicated that her cousin Franz von Brunsvik may have suggested Giulietta to Schindler, to distract any suspicion away from his sister Josephine Brunsvik, with whom Beethoven had been hopelessly in love from 1799 to ca. 1809/1810.\nLa Mara (1909) published Teréz Brunszvik's memoirs, which show her full of admiration and adoration of Beethoven. This, together with interviews of some of the Brunsvik descendants, led her to the conclusion that Therese must have been the \"Immortal Beloved.\"\n\nAt first most researchers, including Alexander Wheelock Thayer, also thought Therese was the \"Immortal Beloved\". Thayer thought the letter must have been written around 1806-07. Thomas-San-Galli (1909, 1910) checked out the official listings of guests in Bohemia, and at first (in 1909) concluded that Amalie Sebald was the \"Immortal Beloved\". Sebald was definitely not in Prague at the beginning of July 1812, and Cooper (2000, p. 416) consequently ruled her out as a candidate. Thomas-San-Galli then speculated (in 1910) that it might instead have been Teréz Brunszvik, who he thought could have (secretly) traveled to Prague.\n\nDoubts were raised by de Hevesy (1910), who ruled out Teréz Brunszvik, and by Unger (1910) against Amalie Sebald. A summary of the older literature can be found in Forbes (1967, pp. 1088–1092).\n\nThere was also a forged Beethoven letter by Paul Bekker in \"Die Musik\", But it was already shown to be a hoax by Newman (1911) –- a last-ditch effort to salvage the discredited Guicciardi hypothesis.\n\nThe date of the \"Immortal Beloved\" letter –- 6/7 July 1812 -– has meanwhile been firmly established, not only by watermarks and references, but also by a later letter by Beethoven to Rahel Varnhagen, which suggests he must have met his \"Immortal Beloved\" on 3 July 1812: \"I am sorry, dear V., that I could not spend the last evening in Prague with you, and I myself found it impolite, but a circumstance I could not foresee prevented me.\"\n\nLa Mara (1920), after discovering more letters and notes in the Brunsvik estates, was now convinced \"that ... Josephine widowed Countess Deym was Beethoven's 'Immortal Beloved'\".\n\nCzeke (1938), for the first time, published Therese's diary notes ending in 1813; some were known already to Rolland (1928). and concluded that Beethoven was in love with Josephine, but nonetheless he tended towards Therese as the \"Immortal Beloved\".\n\nKaznelson (1954) evaluated more of the documents in the Brunsvik estates, and even though he thought that Rahel Varnhagen was behind the \"Distant Beloved\" he concluded that the \"Immortal Beloved\" must have been Josephine mainly because her daughter Minona was born exactly nine months after the encounter with Beethoven and her husband Baron Stackelberg was away. Kaznelson arrived at his conclusion even though H C Bodmer in Zürich, owner of the \"13 Letters\" after World War II (see following), would not allow him access to them.\n\nEditha and Richard Sterba (1954), using psychoanalysis, argued for Beethoven's nephew Karl as the \"Immortal Beloved\".\n\nSteichen (1959) identified Marie Erdödy to have been a lifelong beloved of Beethoven, and thus could also be the \"Immortal Beloved\".\n\nMarek (1969) argued the case for Dorothea Ertmann.\n\nSchmidt-Görg (1957) published 13 heretofore unknown love letters by Beethoven to Josephine Brunsvik (and a draft letter by him that survived as a copy by Josephine), that could be dated to the period from 1804 to 1809/10 when she was a widow after the early death of her first husband Count Deym. Schmidt-Görg dismissed Kaznelson’s discoveries as \"sensational\". Goldschmidt (1980) explains why the German Beethoven scholarship was so reluctant to accept Kaznelson’s theory (already published before these \"13 letters\"): \"The fact that, as a result of this meeting, they had to take a natural daughter into account, appeared so venturesome to the professional world that the resistance to the Josephine hypothesis stiffened noticeably.\" Schmidt-Görg (1957, p. 31) believed that with the last letter (which he still thought to have been written in 1807 – not 1809) and with Josephine's marriage to Baron Stackelberg (in 1810) the love relationship was terminated.\n\nLey (1957, p. 78) saw it differently: \"Only on the negative side has one been able to arrive at certain conclusions: neither Giulietta Guicciardi, nor Amalie Sebald, nor Bettina Brentano can be considered any longer, and not even Therese Brunsvik, who for a long time was seriously regarded as the recipient of the famous love letter. But curiously enough, it is precisely the same documents which shed a definitive light, in the negative sense, on Therese which bear witness to Beethoven's passionate love for her sister Josephine.\"\n\nRiezler (1962, p. 46), still very much a \"standard\" German biography of Beethoven, followed Kaznelson regarding Josephine being his \"only love\", likewise Dahlhaus (1991, p. 247) who concluded that \"internal evidence\" points to Josephine.\n\nThe French authors Jean and Brigitte Massin (1955) identified Josephine as the \"Immortal Beloved\", mainly based on comparisons of the \"Letter to the Immortal Beloved\" with the earlier 14 (15) love letters: \"The letter to the ‘Immortal Beloved’ … not only uses similar wording, but also emphasizes his long-time faithfulness to his one and only Beloved.\" In addition, with regard to traces in Beethoven’s compositions, the \"Massins argue that ... the presence of Josephine in Beethoven's life left traces in his music. ... From the standpoint of music theory, the connections make eminent sense.\"\n\nAfter Massin & Massin (1955) and Goldschmidt (1980), Tellenbach (1983, 1987, 1988, 1999) argued extensively the case for Josephine, based on many newly discovered documents, like Therese's later diary notes, e.g., on the discovery of the \"Three letters by Beethoven … they must have been to Josephine whom he loved passionately.”\n\n\"Beethoven! It is like a dream, that he was the friend, the confidant of our house – a beautiful mind! Why did not my sister Josephine, as widow Deym, take him as her husband? Josephine's soul-mate! They were born for each other. She would have been happier with him than with Stackelberg. Maternal affection made her forgo her own happiness.\" She could not contemplate marrying Beethoven, a commoner, for the simple reason that she would have lost the guardianship of her aristocratic children.\n\nAgain Therese on Beethoven: \"How unhappy, with such intellectual talent. At the same time Josephine was unhappy! \"Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien\" – both together they would have been happy (perhaps). What he needed was a wife, that’s for sure.\"<br>\n\"I was so lucky to have been acquainted with Beethoven, intimately and intellectually, for so many years! Josephine's intimate friend, her soul mate! They were born for each other, and if both were still alive, they would be united.\"<br>\nGoldschmidt's evaluation of the \"Josephine hypothesis\": \"Without conclusive proofs of the opposite one should no longer want to part prematurely with the increasingly justified assumption that the 'Immortal Beloved' could hardly be anyone else but the 'Only Beloved'.\"\n\nJosephine's candidacy as the \"Immortal Beloved\" was contested by Solomon (1988), mainly in response to Massin (1955, 1970), Goldschmidt (1980) and Tellenbach (1983).\n\nIn 1955 the French scholars Jean and Brigitte Massin noted that Antonie Brentano was present in Prague and Karlsbad at the time and proposed her as a possible candidate for the \"Immortal Beloved\":\n\n\"The assumption that it could have been Antonie Brentano, is both tantalizing and absurd.\" They then argue:<br>\nTantalizing is the assumption, because\nAbsurd, they argue, is the assumption because of\n\nThere was four years later also a claim by a Japanese author (Aoki 1959, 1968) who had \"discovered\" Antonie. However, this had not been noticed outside Japan. She also published her findings again in a recent book in German (Aoki 2008).\n\nOnce again and more detailed Solomon (1972, 1998) suggested Antonie Brentano to have been the \"Immortal Beloved\". His hypothesis was founded on two major assumptions (or prerequisites):\nad 1: Antonie arrived in Prague on 3 July 1812 after an arduous journey with husband, child and servant (and was registered there); she left at dawn the following morning: \"Where did she have time that night for a tryst with Beethoven?\" (Steblin 2007, p. 148) Solomon (1972, p. 577) admits: \"There is no proof that Beethoven and Antonie met in Prague.\" And regarding Karlsbad: \"It is possible that the letter arose from a ... meeting with a woman who informed Beethoven that she was going to Karlsbad and then failed to carry out her declared intention.\" (Solomon 1998, p. 219 f.) Goldschmidt showed that \"for short stays, residents [as opposed to foreigners] were exempt from reporting requirements\".\n\nad 2: There are no love letters from or to Antonie, and no other documents supporting the possibility of a love relationship with Beethoven, there is only a letter by Antonie to her brother-in-law Clemens, where she expressed her \"admiration\" of Beethoven: \"At what point this worship was transformed into love is not yet known. My estimate is ... in the fall of 1811. … The love affair was under way by late 1811.\" Solomon (1998, p. 229) quotes as supporting his case the Song \"An die Geliebte\" [To the Beloved] WoO 140, an autograph of which contains in Antonie’s handwriting the remark: \"Requested by me from the author on 2 March 1812.\" The background to this: \"In November 1811, we see Beethoven writing a newly composed song with the heading ‘An die Geliebte’ [To the Beloved] into the album of the Bavarian Court singer Regina Lang. … Dilettante verses … by a clumsy author, a real dilettante, a coffeehouse poet.\" Solomon (1972, p. 572) declares that Beethoven’s separation from his \"Only Beloved\" Josephine two years before (due to her second marriage) does not rule out that she could have been the \"Immortal Beloved\": “There is no certainty that the affair was not momentarily rekindled a half-decade later. ... There is still room for a reasonable doubt.\" (Solomon 1998, p. 461, n. 48.)\n\nSolomon's hypothesis was contested by Goldschmidt (1980), Tellenbach (1983, 1987, 1988, 1993/1994, 1998), Beahrs (1972, 1986, 1988, 1993), Dahlhaus (1991), Pichler (1994), Altman (1996), Meredith (2000), Steblin (2007), Walden (2011), Caeyers (2012, and Swaffort (2014).\n\nGoldschmidt (1980) summarizes: \"The Antonia hypothesis … is not so fully convincing that it excludes all others.\" and: \"In order to possibly verify the Antonia-Hypothesis with its inherent factual contradictions once and forever, it is necessary to falsify the other hypotheses that have been offered.\"\n\nAltman (1996) \"demonstrates, as indeed Tellenbach has done, that much of the basis for the claims of Antonie's supporters consists of distortions, suppositions, opinions, and even plain inaccuracies.\" (Cooper 1996, p. 18)\n\nHowever, Altman's suggestion that the \"Immortal Beloved\" was Marie Erdödy was shown to be \"impossible\" by Cooper (1996).\n\nLund (1988) made a claim that Antonie’s son Karl, born exactly eight months after the alleged encounter with Beethoven, should have been his son; even Solomon did not endorse this, as he thought \"it was 'sensationalistic'.\" (Meredith 2011, p. x)\n\nBeahrs (1993, p. 183 f.) supported Josephine: \"Was there for him in fact … one deep and lasting passion for a certain dear one, marriage to whom was precluded, not by psychological inhibitions of the inner man, but by prohibitive heart-breaking externals? … Where is any evidence whatsoever of true romantic love for even such dear ones as Marie Erdödy or Dorothea von Ertmann, Therese Malfatti or Antonie Brentano? Although all have been advanced as Beethoven's unknown Immortal Beloved, the assessment is unsupported by the record or by any known correspondence. Intimate friends of Beethoven, true, one and all; but loves? There is one, however, and only one, to whom Beethoven did pour his heart out in impassioned declarations of undying love remarkably similar to the phraseology of the anguished letter to his Immortal Beloved… That one is his 'BELOVED AND ONLY J' – Josephine.\"\n\nPulkert’s (2000) claim about one Almerie Esterházy, whom Beethoven did not even know, was refuted by Steblin (2001). Meredith (2000, p. 47) summarily comments: \"… we lack evidence of a connection between Almerie and Beethoven... I must reiterate that we have no such evidence of a passionate love relationship between Antonie and Beethoven either, just of a close friendship; for Josephine, … we know he was indeed passionately in love with her in 1805-1807 at least.\"\n\nFinally, Kopitz’ (2001) \"valiant effort … show[ed] that Antonie cannot have been the ‘Immortal Beloved’. She was a happily married wife and mother … her candidacy, which includes the improbable scenario of a ‘ménage à trois’ in Karlsbad, makes no psychological sense.\" (Steblin 2007, p. 148)<br>\nWalden (2011, p. 5) suggests that Bettina Brentano was Beethoven’s \"Immortal Beloved\", based on the assumption that one of the two spurious letters by Beethoven to her is true: \"If that letter to Bettina was genuine, it would prove conclusively that Bettina was the Immortal Beloved, but the original has not survived, and the authenticity is strongly doubted today. ... her reliability and truthfulness are today under a cloud.\" Meredith (2011, p. xxii), in his \"Introduction\", has reviewed the debate over the major candidates and he believes that \"Walden’s proposal merits unbiased consideration\".<br>\nMeredith (2011), reviewing the history of the debate so far, deplores the fact that French and German authors (like Massin & Massin and - until then - Goldschmidt) were never translated into English, thus depriving especially the US-based Beethoven scholarship of the most valuable resources in this field of study: \"Unfortunately, several of the most important and controversial studies about the Immortal Beloved have never appeared in English translation, which has substantially restricted their impact.\" (p. xv) \"Tellenbach ... too has unfortunately never appeared in English translation.\" (p. xvii)\n\nSignificant new discoveries in European archives were made and published by Steblin (2002, 2007, 2009, 2009a) and Skwara/Steblin (2007). These can be summarized into two important items:\n\n\"A new way of looking at old evidence confirms that Josephine was Beethoven's one and only 'Immortal Beloved'. ... All of the puzzling aspects about Beethoven's affair with the 'Immortal Beloved'. including his various cryptic comments, can be explained in terms of his one known beloved – Josephine. Why do we doubt his word that there was only one woman who had captured his heart?\" (Steblin 2007, p. 180).\n\nIn the film \"Immortal Beloved\", written and directed by Bernard Rose, the Immortal Beloved is Beethoven's sister-in-law Johanna Reiss, with whom he had a long and frustrating legal battle over the custody of his nephew Karl van Beethoven.\n\nA song cycle \"Briefe an die unsterbliche Geliebte\" for mezzo-soprano (or baritone) and piano trio has been written by Canadian composer James K. Wright. The cycle sets excerpts from Beethoven’s letter of 6–7 July 1812. A recording of the work by mezzo-soprano Julie Nesrallah and the Gryphon Trio is available.\n\n"}

She is the first Creole-American winemaker to own and operate a winery in the United States.\n\nRideau was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, a paternal descendent of Frenchman Armand Allard Gabriel Duplantier who sailed to America in 1777 on Marquis de Lafayette's ship \"La Victoire\" and established a plantation in Point Coupee, and later the Magnolia Mound plantation in Baton Rouge.\n\nShe grew up in the Creole 7th Ward of the city, where her mother and uncles operated the Creole Bar and Grille. She has said, \"There was not a great emphasis placed on education in my community, especially with Creole. Both my father and my mother attended high school, but neither graduated. Her father left the family and departed to California after her parents divorced when she was two-years old.\" She initially aspired to become a Broadway dancer. Her grandmother moved in and taught Rideau to speak French. In the summer months she visited her father and worked at his ranch in Corona, California, and after several years of insistence that she wanted to live closer to her father, they moved into a one-room flat in eastern Los Angeles when she was 12.\n\nHer mother found work at a nearby sewing factory. At 16, Iris she became pregnant and married, only to divorce the father of her daughter, Renee, a year later. She found employment at her mother's factory and enrolled in night classes at a junior college. Rideau has said of her employment at the factory and decision to take night classes, \"The line of mostly Black and Hispanic women would wrap around the corner in the mornings. We made about $15 a week. I knew I'd need an education or I'd never escape.\" She graduated after a year and began working as a receptionist for an insurance agency, passing as a white woman to keep her job.\n\nRideau married Jimmy Rideau in 1957, and they divorced in 1978. She has since remained single and is a great grandmother.\n\nRideau has said that her drive to succeed as a businesswoman was a result of her natural self-motivating will and the environment that she grew up in. She has said \"I never want to experience poverty again. That is what drives me. Also, when my daughter was growing up, I wanted to provide her with the security that I did not have as a child.\"\n\nRideau began her entrepreneurial career in 1967 when she opened the Rideau & Associates Insurance Agency, and followed with Rideau Retirement Planning Consultants. She was an involved investment and securities broker in Los Angeles, and became actively involved in seeking better rights for ethnic minorities. Rideau gained much respect in Los Angeles for her activism in the 1960s, and from 1973 to 1976, she was appointed as Chairman to the Mayor’s Affirmative Action Committee, under then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, a job which involved securing employment for hundreds of ethnic minority women in the city. She managed the Rideau Insurance Agency from 1967 to 1999, and in 1982, she established Rideau Securities Firm, and set up two offices with 50 employees.\n\nRideau had long been passionate about food and drink when she decided to enter a career as a vintner in 1989. She bought a 6-acre plot of land in Solvang, California in the Santa Ynez Valley that year, and added 24 more acres six years later. This land became Rideau Vineyard two years later. Rideau employed an architect and winemaker to transform an adobe house into a wine tasting centre, with bathroom and kitchen facilities.\n\nRideau sold her insurance agency and brokerage company in 1997. She said of her decision, \"You know when you get close to retirement you say, 'What am I going to do?' And I said, 'There's nothing to do out in this country other than raise horses or develop a vineyard. And I don't ride horses, so the next thing to do was start a vineyard.\" Rideau is interested in the production of Rhone wines, and produces Syrah, Mourvedre, Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier. \"Black Enterprise\" magazine has said that she \"effortlessly combines delectable grapes from the Rhone Valley of France with the savory taste of Creole cuisine in her winery.\"\n\nShe sold 300 cases in her first year and now produces some 7,500 cases annually and has worked with winemakers Ariel Lavie (2002-2005) and Andres Ibarra (2005-2008) making around $3.5 million a year. Her wines have won the Best in Show in the Los Angeles International Wine Competition.\n\nPamela M. Kalte has stated that her \"success in the competitive world of vines and vineyards seems surprising, given that she knew nothing about wines before setting up Rideau.\"\n\n"}

He received his first artistic lessons from a Dutch artist Schwonbek at the engraving shop of the Kremlin Armoury. In 1711 the Armory together with Ivan Nikitin was moved to Saint Petersburg. In 1716–1720 he and his brother Roman Nikitin were sent to Italy by Peter the Great. The brothers learnt the art of painting at Florence and Venice. After returning to Russia Nikitin became the favorite court painter of Peter the Great. He worked in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\n\nAfter Peter's death in 1725 Nikitin continued to work at the court until 1732, when he and his brothers Roman and Rodion (the dean of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow Kremlin) were arrested for the distribution of pamphlets against vice-Procurator of Synod Feofan Prokopovich. Ivan was tortured, for five years imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress, then whipped and exiled to Tobolsk.\n\nIn 1740 Anna of Russia signed an amnesty for the brothers. The amnesty came into force in 1741. By request of the new Empress Elizabeth of Russia, Nikitin travelled back from Tobolsk to Saint Petersburg and died somewhere on the road either in late 1741 or in early 1742.\n\nThe early portraits by Nikitin had a strong influence of the traditional 17th century parsuna style: no perspective, rigid local colors, dark backgrounds. The later portraits are typical Baroque paintings. Most art historians consider the Nikitin's best portraits to be and . There are problems with attributing of the subject of the portrait, with different historians arguing that he is Ivan Mazepa or Ivan Skoropadsky or Kazimir Ian Sapega, or Pavlo Polubotok, but they all are equal in emphasising the psychological depth of the portrait.\n\nBesides portraits, Ivan Nikitin is also considered to be the first notable Russian battle painter due to his paintings of the Battle of Poltava and Battle of Kulikovo.\n\n"}

Though he was interested in drawing as a child, he did not know what to do with his hobby. He held down a number of jobs after high school, including a stint in the Navy, in construction and as a bicycle messenger in Washington, D.C. He returned to illustration when he first worked with an Apple computer in 1990 while attending Northern Virginia Community College. He currently resides in Morro Bay, California.\n\nIn 2002, Hovath established Jamestoons Studios, and worked with Google, Nestlé, \"Reader’s Digest\", Sprint, Tyco and Toshiba International. His work appeared in advertising, computer games for children and other books. His influences include Josh “Shag” Agle, Theodor “Dr. Seuss” Geisel and Hanna-Barbera cartoons.\n\nHorvath said his inspiration for his series of stores about dogs in construction came from his own sons’ interest in stopping to watch building job sites.\n\nHarperCollins accepted his first book, \"Dig, Dogs, Dig: A Construction Tail\", which tells the story of a construction crew of canines who are building a park, shortly after Horvath attended the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators' Los Angeles summer conference in August 2011.

His nicknames include \"Dark Priest\" and \"Mtr. President\". He claims to have run for President of the United States in every election since 1996.\n\nJudd was born May 23, 1958, in Pasadena, California. He is married, and professes to be a Rasta-Christian. He claims to have run in every United States presidential election since 1996 and for mayor of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Governor of New Mexico. He further claims to be a former member of the Federation of Super Heroes. Judd has one child, born on September 3, 1990, a son named Marcus Miciah Robertson.\n\nIn 1999 Judd was convicted of two counts of \"mailing a threatening communication with intent to extort money or something of value\" and sentenced to 210 months (17½ years) in federal prison. The conviction has been falsely connected to litigation involving the University of New Mexico which was a civil rights complaint he initiated. His actual crime involved postcards that stated \"Send the money back now, Keith Judd, Last Chance or Dead.\" and a package containing a semen stained Playboy, a knife inside the magazine, a key chain, and his father's military discharge papers. He also sent letters to jurors after his trial. He has appealed his conviction no fewer than 36 times, but each appeal has been dismissed for various reasons.\n\nJudd was released in June 2013 on a supervised release program. In October, his probation office sought a warrant for his arrest for violating the terms of his supervision. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, with another 24 months of supervised release. He has since been released a second time under supervision.\n\nAs a perennial candidate, Judd has thrice run for president in the Democratic Party's primaries. Judd first did this in the 2008 election cycle, and has continued to run in both cycles since. Each of the times he has run, Judd has managed to qualify to be included on the ballots of at least one Democratic Party's primary or caucus.\n\nIn the 2008 Presidential election he filed to run as a Democrat in 14 states but only appeared on the ballot in Idaho.\n\nJudd finished third in the May 27, 2008, non-binding Idaho Democratic presidential preference primary with 1.7 percent of the vote, behind Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. No delegates to the Democratic National Convention were at stake in the primary as Idaho's delegation was determined at the February 5 Democratic caucus, which Judd unsuccessfully contested.\n\nBelow is a table of Judd's performance in the primaries.\nJudd filed to run for president again in the 2012 general election, and attained ballot status in the West Virginia Democratic primary. On May 8, 2012, Judd won 41% of the primary vote in West Virginia against incumbent Barack Obama, a higher percentage of the vote in one state than any other primary opponent of Obama had hitherto achieved in 2012 (a figure later surpassed by John Wolfe, Jr.'s showing in the Arkansas primary). While this showing would normally have entitled Judd to delegates at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, state officials expressed some uncertainty as to whether Judd had completed the required formalities, such as filing a slate of delegates and completing paperwork. Judd, who did not qualify for any other primary ballots, contested the ballot count, alleging that ballot workers suppressed the actual total (which he said showed him in the lead) in an effort to cover up an Obama loss.\n\nBelow is a table of Judd's performance in the primaries.\n\nJudd sent a handwritten note to the FEC announcing his 2016 presidential candidacy as a Democrat on August 16, 2014. He filed his official documents with the FEC in September 2015.

On graduating from his second degree he taught Mathematics at King's College School, Wimbledon for two years, before returning to his studies in 2004. Changing discipline, he first read for an MA in War Studies at King's College London, and then a PhD in First World War Strategy and Military Intelligence at Pembroke College, Cambridge.\n\nWest was introduced to rowing by his father, Richard, and began coxing at Kingston Rowing Club aged 10. When he quickly outgrew this role he started sculling, and entered his first race in November 1989, going unbeaten for over 2 years. He won the National Rowing Championships in a single scull at his age category when 15, then trialled for the British under-18 rowing team. Although initially successful, he suffered a severe lower back injury and was forced to retire from sport for three years to undergo intensive physiotherapy.\n\nFor his first two years at Cambridge West rehabilitated himself back into a boat, finally rowing again in spring 1997. After a term of rowing for his college in the May Bumps he rowed in the Cambridge Goldie crew in the 1998 Boat Race, losing to Isis after an equipment failure two-thirds of the way down the course.\n\nWest represented Great Britain for the first time in 1998, and made the Cambridge Blue Boat in 1999, rowing in the six seat, a position he would take in all his Cambridge crews. Considered by many to have been one of the fastest crews the Club had produced, Cambridge went on to win comfortably in the second fastest time in Boat Race history.\n\nSelected to represent Great Britain again that summer, and with the opportunity to go to his first Olympic Games, West took a year out of his studies to concentrate on his rowing. While away he was elected President of the Cambridge University Boat Club for the 2001 Boat Race campaign. Despite having lost both the Boat Race and the Isis-Goldie Race in 2000, Cambridge comfortably beat Oxford exactly six months after West's Sydney final. Goldie also beat Isis that year, giving Cambridge the clean sweep, the last time this would happen for six years. West was subsequently voted 'Cambridge Sports Personality of the Year, 2000/2001'.\n\nAlthough he initially finished at Cambridge in 2001, West returned in 2005 and rowed in the 2006 Boat Race. Cambridge were favourites for the 2006 Race but rough conditions on the day led to Cambridge taking on a significant amount of water and coming close to sinking, leaving Oxford to pull away to victory.\n\nThe following year, Cambridge were even stronger favourites and, with five returning members of the 2006 crew, were keen to put the record straight. After a tighter than expected early section of the race, Cambridge pulled away after twelve minutes to win. As the rules of the Boat Race state that no athlete can participate in more than four races as an undergraduate and four races as a graduate (the \"Rankov Rule\"), this was West's last for Cambridge. Throughout the season, the crew had been accompanied by an ethnographer, Mark De Rond, who subsequently wrote a book on the season's experiences, \"The Last Amateurs: To Hell and Back with the Cambridge Boat Race Crew\".\n\nWest joined the British rowing team after the 2007 Boat Race, but retired from international rowing two months later to concentrate on his academic studies.\n\nWest's three wins from four Boat Races makes him one of the most successful Cambridge rowing Blues, after Chris Baillieu who won four from four, while the eight years between his first and last Cambridge appearances is the longest span in Boat Race history. West was also the first member of Cambridge University to win the Olympic Games while still a student.\n\nWest's international rowing career began in 1998, when he competed for Great Britain with Mark Hunter in the Double Scull at the under-23 World Rowing Championships in Ioannina, Greece. The following year he was selected to row in the Men's Eight at the World Rowing Championships.\n\nIn 1999 he was selected as part of an eight, coached by Martin McElroy and Harry Mahon. It was second at all three regattas in the 1999 Rowing World Cup, broke the British record on two occasions and came close to breaking the world record. At the World Rowing Championships it briefly led the final, the first British eight ever to do so, before taking a silver medal behind the 1997 and 1998 World Champions, USA, the highest finish position of a British Eight at a World Rowing Championships.\n\nWest took a year out of his studies to concentrate on preparing for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The crew had two changes from the previous year and was even more successful in the early season, taking two gold medals and one silver from the Rowing World Cup and becoming the first British Eight to win the event outright.\n\nAt the Olympic Games Britain were the joint favourites for the gold medal, alongside the USA, who had not raced internationally that season. A poor row in the first round, West's 23rd birthday, saw them lose to a strong Australian crew, but they won the repechage. In the final Britain led from start to finish to win the Gold medal for the first time since the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games, with West being the youngest member of the crew, and the first member of Cambridge University to win at the Olympics while still a student. Australia took the silver. The crew of Andrew Lindsay, Ben Hunt-Davis, Simon Dennis, Louis Attrill, Luka Grubor, Kieran West, Fred Scarlett, Steve Trapmore and Rowley Douglas were all subsequently awarded the MBE for \"services to rowing\" in the 2001 New Year Honours.\n\nThough selected for the British Eight in 2001, West was unable to compete at the World Rowing Championships due to a rib injury followed by a shoulder injury sustained earlier that season. The following year West stroked the British Coxed Four to a gold medal at the 2002 World Rowing Championships in Seville. The crew also contained two of the 2000 British Eight, Luka Grubor and Steve Trapmore, and two members of the 2001 Cambridge Blue Boat, Tom Stallard and Christian Cormack. The following year West and Stallard were again in the Coxed Four and took a silver medal at the World Championships in Milan.\n\nWest continued rowing internationally for the next three years, in the Men's Eight at the 2004 Athens Olympics, stroking the Eight to fourth place at the 2005 World Championships in Gifu, and back in the six seat of the Eight at the 2006 World Championships in Eton. He retired from international rowing in March 2008.\n\nIn the course of his rowing career West won every major international and domestic rowing event: the Olympic Games, the World Rowing Championships, the Rowing World Cup, the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race, the Head of the River Race, the Head of the River Fours, and he came out of retirement in 2008 to win the Visitors' Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta, in a composite crew representing Imperial College London and Kingston Rowing Club.\n\nWest remains a member of Kingston Rowing Club. His last race was for Pembroke College Boat Club first men's eight, in the 6 seat, who were one of only two crews in the Mays first division to receive blades in 2009, the other being Magdalene College Boat Club.\n\nWest's older brother, Damian, is also an international oarsman, who rowed for Oxford University Boat Club in the 1996 Boat Race and for Great Britain from 1993 to 1997.\n\nCity of Cambridge Rowing Club owns a men's eight named in West's honour: \"Kieran West, MBE\". The boat was originally owned by Christ's College, Cambridge, where West was studying during his first period at Cambridge.\n\nWest was born with a cleft lip and palate. On 8 August 2009, West married Lourina Pretorius a former student at Newnham College, Cambridge from South Africa. The following month, he started work at McKinsey & Co. in London, where he remains employed. The couple has a daughter.\n\n\n\n"}

He was also employed by the School of Library Science at Case Western Reserve University as a lecturer on the History of the Book, and instructor of History and Art of the Book.\n\nOtto Ege's greatest fame, however, came as a result of his book-breaking.

These portfolios were in turn sold and distributed world wide. Although strong profits were made from each sale, Ege defended his actions by stating, \"Surely to allow a thousand people 'to have and to hold' an original manuscript leaf, and to get a thrill and understanding that comes only from actual and frequent contact with these art heritages, is justification enough for the scattering of fragments.\"\n\nOver the last several years, Prof. Peter Stoicheff of the University of Saskatchewan has been working to locate all existing Ege Portfolios, and to foster co-operation from their respective owners in creating an \"Ege Medieval Manuscript Database\" with the ultimate goal being the digital reconstruction of the complete books.\n\nEge's personal collection, including 50 unbroken manuscript books, was in 2015 acquired by the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library (part of Yale University Library).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19726291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19726291", "title": "Peter Petreius", "text": "Peter Petreius\n\nPeer Peersson of Erlesunda, also known as Per Erlesund and by his Latinized pen name Peter Petreius (Uppsala, 1570 – October 28, 1622, Stockholm) was a Swedish diplomat, envoy to Muscovy and author of the \"History of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy\" (1615) that attempted to present a complete history of Russia from the foundation of Kievan Rus to the end of the Time of Troubles.\n\nPeer Peersson was born in the family of Uppsala Cathedral priest; his father, Per-Benedict Persson, later became the Bishop of Västerås and Linköping. Per Persson junior graduated from the King Johann School and joined the Magdeburg University. After a short period of dedicated studies Peersson slipped into a lifestyle of a rake, indulging in drinking and duels; in 1593 he was expelled from the university and ended up in jail for debts. He managed to return to Sweden and joined the office of Duke Charles, King Sigismund's uncle, who ascended to the throne in 1604 as Charles IX of Sweden.\n\nIn 1601 Peersson left Sweden for a four-year reconnaissance tour of Muscovy in the guise of a doctor. His dispatches to the court were reproduced by Jacques Auguste de Thou in his \"Historiarum sui temporis\". Back in Sweden, Peersson compiled his dispatches into a \"Fair and true relation\" on recent Russian past from Ivan Grozny to the ascension of Vasily Shuysky. The book was based exclusively on Peersson's own experience and on the oral narratives by contemporary Russians (Vasily Shuysky, Maria Nagaya and the retinue of False Dmitriy I) and Western witnesses (Caspar Fiedler, Conrad Bussow). Peersson in real life tracked Bussow's activity with suspicion and recovered evidence of Bussow's treason that resulted in the defection of Swedish garrison in Narva (his allegations are contested by modern authors, e.g. Orchard). Persson obtained the manuscript of Bussow's \"The Disturbed State of the Russian Realm\" (the first, 1614, version) and reused it in his own later works. Historians of the first half of 19th century incorrectly considered Peersson the primary source for Bussow's book until Arist Kunik (1849) and Sergey Solovyov (1858) restored Bussow in his own rights.\n\nIn 1607–1608 Peersson returned to Moscow as the king's envoy, seeking a military alliance between Sweden and Muscovy. When the treaty was signed, Peersson joined the Swedish corps of Jacob De la Gardie that was hired by tsar Vasily; he left Russia upon the completion of De la Gardie Campaign and returned in 1612, to Novgorod. In 1615 he was spotted in Denmark and Poland, collecting intelligence for the upcoming War of 1617-1618. In the same year he published his \"opus magnum\", the \"History of the Grand Duchy of Moscow\". In 1617 Persson was involved in signing the Treaty of Stolbovo which was incorporated in the 1620 German edition of the \"History\". His death in Stockholm was, presumably, caused by plague.\n\nModern Russian historians agree that the \"facts\" that occurred during Peersson's stay in Moscow were, generally, retold reliably although sometimes exaggerated (e. g. scenes of cannibalism on the streets of Moscow presented as eyewitness report). Peersson-Petreius was confident that Tsarevich Dimitri was indeed killed in Uglich in 1591; like Isaac Massa, he condemned Boris Godunov for arranging the murder, yet Persson's story contains an unrealistic scene of an arson in Uglich and Moscow, set up simultaneously to cover up the crime. False Dmitriy I, according to Peersson, was indeed Grigory Otrepyev. Peersson's understanding of the general sequence of the Time of Troubles and their causes is very close to modern mainstream theory, but his description of contemporary events outside his own and his direct sources' reach is regarded as only partially credible. Even the late 18th – early 19th century \"fiction\" authors criticized Peersonn for indiscriminate retelling of anecdotes of the Vegetable Lamb sort and his apparent pro-Swedish bias: \"...should we even allow that Petreius was not influenced in his judgement by the politics of his own court, yet, as an author, he is liable to great exception: for the numberless fictions and gross misrepresentations which he retails in his Chronicle, prove extreme proneness to credulity.\" His retelling of Kievan Rus chronicles, acquired through oral narrative, is loaded with extreme normanist attitude, and not reliable at all.\n\nPeersson's account of social life in Russia, Eastern Orthodoxy, popular culture and traditions was harsh and unforgiving. It is nevertheless corroborated by independent, equally unforgiving memoirs by Giles Fletcher, the Elder (1591) and Samuel Collins (1671) and is representative of the Protestant view of contemporary Muscovy.\n\n"}
{"id": "2736800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2736800", "title": "Prahlad Jani", "text": "Prahlad Jani\n\nPrahlad Jani (), also known as Mataji or Chunriwala Mataji, (born 13 August 1929) is an Indian breatharian monk who claims to have lived without food and water since 1940. He says that the goddess Amba sustains him.\n\nBorn Chunriwala Mataji, Jani grew up in Charada village in Mehsana district. According to Jani, he left his home in Rajasthan at the age of seven, and went to live in the jungle.\n\nAt the age of 12, Jani underwent a religious experience and became a follower of the Hindu goddess Amba. From that time, he chose to dress as a female devotee of Amba, wearing a red sari-like garment, jewellery and crimson flowers in his shoulder-length hair. Jani is commonly known as \"Mataji\" (\"[a manifestation of] The Great Mother\"). Jani believes that the goddess provides him a liquid sustenance or water which drops down through a hole in his palate, allowing him to live without food or drink.\n\nSince the 1970s, Jani has lived as a hermit in a cave in the rainforest near the Gujarati temple of Ambaji, awakening at 4am each day and spending most of his time meditating.\n\nTwo observational studies of Jani have been conducted, one in 2003 and one in 2010, both involving Dr Sudhir Shah, a neurologist at the Sterling Hospitals in Ahmedabad, India, who had studied people claiming to have exceptional abilities, including other fasters such as Hira Ratan Manek. In both cases the investigators confirmed Jani's ability to survive healthily without food and water during the testing periods, although neither study was submitted to a scientific journal. When questioned six days into the 2010 experiment, the DRDO spokesperson announced that the study's findings would be \"confidential\" until results were established, and a further official press release by the team stated that any inside analysis information may be disclosed only at the discretion of the principal investigator, DIPAS. Uninvolved doctors and other critics have questioned the validity of the studies and stated their belief that, although people can survive for days without food or water, it is not possible to survive for years, especially since glucose, a substrate critical to brain function, isn't provided. The veracity of Mataji's claims has also never been independently confirmed with all tests being indigenously conducted.\n\nIn 2003, Dr Sudhir Shah and other physicians at Sterling Hospitals, Ahmedabad, India observed Jani for 10 days. He stayed in a sealed room. Doctors say that he passed no urine or stool during the observation, but that urine appeared to form in the bladder. A hospital spokesperson said that Jani was physically normal, but noted that a hole in the palate was an abnormal condition. The fact that Jani's weight dropped slightly during the 10 days has cast some doubt on his claim to go indefinitely without food.\n\nFrom 22 April until 6 May 2010, Prahlad Jani was again observed and tested by Dr Sudhir Shah and a team of 35 researchers from the Indian Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS), as well as other organizations. The director of DIPAS said that the results of the observations could \"tremendously benefit mankind\", as well as \"soldiers, victims of calamities and astronauts\", all of whom may have to survive without food or water for long durations. The tests were again conducted at Sterling Hospitals. Professor Anil Gupta of SRISTI, involved in monitoring the tests, described the team as being \"intrigued\" by Jani's kriyas apparently allowing him to control his body's physiological functions.\n\nThe team studied Jani with daily clinical examinations, blood tests, and scans. Round-the-clock surveillance was reportedly followed using multiple CCTV cameras and personal observation. The researchers say that Jani was taken out of the sealed room for tests and exposure to sun under continuous video recording. According to the researchers, Jani's only contact with any form of fluid was said to be during gargling and occasional bathing starting from the 5th day of observation, and the toilet in Jani's room was sealed to test his claim that he did not need to urinate or defecate.\n\nAfter fifteen days of observation during which he reportedly did not eat, drink or go to the toilet, all medical tests on Jani were reported as normal and researchers described him as being in better health than someone half his age. The doctors reported that although the amount of liquid in Jani's bladder fluctuated and that Jani appeared \"able to generate urine in his bladder\", he did not pass urine. Based on Jani's reported levels of leptin and ghrelin, two appetite-related hormones, DRDO researchers posited that Jani may be demonstrating an extreme form of adaptation to starvation and water restriction. DIPAS stated in 2010 that further studies were planned, including investigations into how metabolic waste material is eliminated from Jani's body, from where he gets his energy for sustenance, and how he maintains his hydration status.\n\nDr. Michael Van Rooyen, director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, dismissed the observation results as \"impossible\", observing that the bodies of profoundly malnourished people quickly consume their own body's resources, resulting in liver failure, tachycardia and heart strain. A spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association stated that, \"The bottom line is that even fasting for more than a day can be dangerous. You need food to function.\" Nutrition researcher Peter Clifton also disagreed with study results, accusing the research team of \"cheating\" by allowing Jani to gargle and bathe, and stating that a human of average weight would die after \"15 to 20 days\" without water. People who avoid food and water to emulate mystical figures often die. Sanal Edamaruku characterized the experiment as a farce for allowing Jani to move out of the CCTV cameras' field of view, claiming that video footage showed Jani was allowed to receive devotees and to leave the sealed test room for sunbathing. Edamaruku also said that the gargling and bathing activities were insufficiently monitored. Edamaruku was denied access to the site where the tests were conducted in both 2003 and 2010, and accuses Jani of having \"influential protectors\" responsible for denying him permission to inspect the project during its operation, despite having been invited to join the test during a live television broadcast. The Indian Rationalist Association observed that individuals making similar claims in the past have been exposed as frauds.\n\nIn September 2010, Dr. Shah announced that scientists from Austria and Germany had offered to visit India to carry out further research on Jani, and scientists from the United States had also offered to join the research. Jani has expressed interest in cooperating in further investigations.\n\nIn 2006, The Discovery Channel aired a documentary called \"The Boy with Divine Powers\" featuring a five-minute interview with Jani and Shah. In 2010, the Independent Television Network (ITN) posted an article and video featuring Prahlad Jani, commenting on the 2010 tests. In 2010 Prahlad Jani was featured in an Austrian documentary \"Am Anfang war das Licht\" (English title \"In the Beginning There Was Light\").\n\nIn October 2010, the Italian television station Rai 2 broadcast a program named \"Voyager\" which presented an extensive report on Prahlad Jani and the tests.\n\nIn October 2011 Jani was the \"param pujya\" (master of ceremony) in a large shobha yatra performed near Gandhinagar. 1000 paaths of goddess Durga were chanted.\n"}

Her research has impacted many fields, including history, literature, philosophy, art, economics, psychology, sociology, education, organizational development, political science, and healthcare.\n\nEisler was born in Vienna, fled from the Nazis with her parents to Cuba as a small child, and later emigrated to the United States. She obtained degrees in sociology and law from UCLA.\n\nEisler taught pioneering classes on women and the law at UCLA; and now teaches in the graduate Transformative Leadership Program at the California Institute of Integral Studies. She is Editor-in-Chief of the \"Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies\" at the University of Minnesota and President of the Center for Partnership Studies, dedicated to research and education on the partnership model introduced by Eisler's research. She is also a member of the World Future Council.\n\nEisler proposes that new social paradigms are needed that transcend the limitations of conventional social categories such as religious vs. secular, right vs. left, capitalist vs. communist, East vs. West, and pre-industrial vs. industrial or post-industrial. She notes that societies in all these categories have been repressive and violent, and that none answer the question of what kinds of institutions and beliefs support more equitable and peaceful relations. In addressing this question, Eisler's multidisciplinary, cross-cultural research resulted in a new conceptual framework for understanding and improving social systems: \"the partnership-domination continuum.\" The identification of the \"partnership model\" and the \"domination model\" as two underlying social configurations requires a new analytical approach that includes social features that are currently ignored or marginalized, such as the social construction of human/nature connections, parent/child relations, gender roles and relations, and the way we assess the value of the work of caring for people and nature.\n\nShe introduced the term \"domination culture\" to describe a system of top-down rankings ultimately backed up by fear or force - man over man, man over woman, race over race, religion over religion, and man over nature. The configuration of the domination system has four mutually supporting core components: Top-down control in both families and states or tribes, and all institutions in between; Rigid male dominance—and with this, the devaluation by both men and women of anything stereotypically considered \"feminine,\" including care and caregiving; The acceptance, even idealization, of violence as a means of imposing one's will on others; A system of beliefs that presents relations of dominating or being dominated as inevitable and desirable. Examples of societies that orient closely to the domination model include Nazi Germany, Khomeini's Iran, and earlier cultures where chronic violence and despotic rule were the norm.\n\nBy contrast, the configuration of the partnership system consists of the following four mutually supporting core components: A more democratic and egalitarian structure in both the family and state or tribe; equal partnership between women and men, and with this a high valuing in women and men, as well as in social and economic policy, of traits and activities stereotypically considered feminine, such as care and caregiving; a low degree of abuse and violence, because they are not needed to maintain rigid rankings of domination; A system of beliefs that presents relations of partnership and mutual respect as normal and desirable.\n\nExamples of partnership-oriented societies include the Teduray, a tribal society studied by the University of California anthropologist Stuart Schlegel; agrarian societies such as the Minangkabau, studied by the University of Pennsylvania anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday; and technologically advanced ones like Sweden, Norway, and Finland, where there is a more democratic and egalitarian structure in both the family and the state, more equal partnership between men and women (for example, women are 40-50 percent of national legislators), and more caring social policies such as universal health care, paid parental leave, and high quality early childhood education, as well as the rejection of violence in both intimate and international relations.\n\nIn comparing partnership and domination systems, Eisler analyzes the androcracy (governance of social organization dominated by males) of Indo-European and other societies, versus greater orientation to the partnership model (as distinct from matriarchy) for the social organization of Neolithic Europe and the later Minoan civilization that flourished in prehistoric Bronze Age Crete.\n\nTo support the idea that neither men nor women dominated one another, Eisler cites archeological evidence from southeast Europe, especially Crete, drawing much from the research of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas, James Mellaart, Nikolaos Platon, Vere Gordon Childe, and Nanno Marinatos. She also draws heavily from cross-cultural studies, such as Douglas P. Fry's work on foraging cultures that orient to the partnership model, noting that for most of our history humans lived in foraging groups.\n\nHer work has allowed many other scholars to apply partnership/domination and cultural transformation conceptual frameworks to fields ranging from politics and economics to religion, business, and education.\n\nNo society orients completely to a domination system or a partnership system. It is always a matter of degree in what Eisler calls a partnership-domination continuum. But with these configurations in mind, much that otherwise seems random and disconnected begins to fall into place – including how economic systems have been developed, as Eisler documents in \"The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics\" , as well as in many articles and book chapters, including \"Economics as If Caring Matters\" in Challenge.\n\nEisler's international bestseller \"The Chalice and The Blade: Our History, Our Future\" (Harper Collins San Francisco, 1987) was hailed by anthropologist Ashley Montagu as \"the most important book since Darwin's Origin of Species [sic]\". The book has sold 500,000 copies. It has been translated into 26 languages, including most European languages and Chinese, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Hebrew, Japanese, and Arabic.\n\nHer 2007 book, \"The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics\", proposes a new approach to economics that gives visibility and value to the essential human work of caring for people and the planet. It has been hailed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu as \"a template for the better world we have been so urgently seeking,\" Peter Senge as \"desperately needed,\" and by Gloria Steinem as \"revolutionary.\"\n\nIn 2014, Eisler co-authored \"Transforming Interprofessional Partnerships: A New Framework for Nursing and Partnership-Based Health Care\" with University of Minnesota professor Teddie Potter, which provides healthcare professionals with the tools to re-examine current healthcare systems and build a more caring, sustainable system. *The book was the winner of the 2015 Capstone International Book Award and a 2014 American Journal of Nursing Book Award.\n\nEisler's other books include the award-winning \"The Power of Partnership\" and \"Tomorrow's Children\", as well as \"Sacred Pleasure: Sex, Myth, and the Politics of the Body – New Paths to Power and Love\", an exploration of the origins of human violence, and \"Women, Men, and the Global Quality of Life\", which statistically documents the key role of the status of women in a nation's general quality of life.\n\nIn 2011, Tiroir A Films (TAF) based their documentary, \"Mother, Caring for 7 Billion\" on the theories of Riane Eisler.\n\nRiane Eisler keynotes conferences worldwide, and is a consultant to business and government on applications of the partnership model introduced in her work. International venues have included Germany at the invitation of Prof. Rita Süssmuth, President of the Bundestag (the German Parliament) and Daniel Goeudevert (Chair of Volkswagen International); Colombia, invited by the Mayor of Bogota; and the Czech Republic, invited by Václav Havel (President of the Czech Republic). In 2013, Eisler was invited to speak during a Congressional Briefing on \"The Economic Return from Investing in Care Work and Early Childhood Education\" and to speak for the United States State Department.\n\nRiane Eisler is a founding member of the General Evolution Research Group (GERG), a fellow of the World Academy of Art and Science and World Business Academy, a member of the Club of Rome, and a Councilor of the World Future Council in Europe (link) She is a member of the World Commission on Global Consciousness and Spirituality along with the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and other spiritual leaders. She is also co-founder of the Spiritual Alliance to Stop Intimate Violence (SAIV). She is the president of the Center for Partnership Studies, dedicated to research and education. In 2003 she was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto, an initiative of the Center for Partnership Studies, dedicated to research and education.\n\nShe is the author of over 300 essays and articles in publications ranging from Behavioral Science, Futures, Political Psychology, and The UNESCO Courier to Brain and Mind, \"Yes!\", the Human Rights Quarterly, \"The International Journal of Women's Studies\", and the \"World Encyclopedia of Peace\".\n\nEisler was one of the founders of the \"Women's Rights Law Reporter\", the first legal periodical to focus exclusively on women's rights. She is also an active Global Council Member at the International Museum of Women. In 1984 Eisler became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP).\n\nRiane Eisler inspired Professor Min Jiayin of the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences to publish and edit \"The Chalice and the Blade in Chinese Culture\" (published in 1995 by China Social Sciences Publishing House). Min Jiayin's book tested Eisler's cultural transformation theory in Chinese culture, and found that there was also a shift from partnership to domination in Asian prehistory.\n\nIn her 2008 book, \"Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership\", Mary Kirk uses Eisler's cultural transformation theory to offer an interdisciplinary, social systems perspective on issues of access to technology. \"Gender and Information Technology\" explores how shifting from dominator towards partnership systems—as reflected in four primary social institutions (communication, media, education, and business)--might help us move beyond the simplistic notion of access to co-create a real digital revolution worldwide.\n\nRiane Eisler inspired Professor Antonella Riem and a group of scholars based at the University of Udine, the Partnership Studies Group (PSG), to develop significant multi- and inter-disciplinary research, which investigates the presence and meaning of partnership/dominator configurations within World Literatures in English, Language, Education and Arts.\n\nEisler has received many honors, including the Humanist Pioneer Award and the first Alice Paul ERA award. She received the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation's Distinguished Peace Leadership Award for \"demonstrating courageous leadership in the cause of peace\". She was the only woman selected for inclusion in \"Macrohistory and Macrohistorians\" for her work as a cultural historian and evolutionary theorist. Eisler also serves on the Advisory Council of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation.\n\nThe Center for Partnership Studies (CPS), located in Pacific Grove, CA., was established in 1987 for the purpose of researching, developing, and disseminating education on the partnership model as developed by Riane Eisler.\n\nThe Caring Economy Campaign is a project of the Center for Partnership studies that is focused on building a partnership system with clear measures of the economic benefits of the work of caring for people and nature.

And then by the fourth year at Glasgow School of Art, I remember really thinking, I really don’t know what to paint. I really have no idea. I just don’t know what I’m doing. There was a patch where I remember thinking, god, I just want to go and sit in the library and look at stuff. I was really into looking at art. I really liked looking at art books. So my degree show ended up being this big tissue paper installation, really quite big on the wall. I used to go the library and they had these little rooms that you could book.

{"id": "31509153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31509153", "title": "Suzanne Segal", "text": "Suzanne Segal\n\nSuzanne Segal (1955–1997) was a writer and teacher about spiritual enlightenment, known for her sudden experience of Self-Realization which she wrote about in her book \"Collision With the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self\".\n\nIn addition to gaining note in the spiritual community, Segal became a model case of the dissociative condition known as depersonalization disorder (DPD). Along her journey some therapists formally diagnosed her with DPD, while others did not have clear explanations.\n\nTwo years after her shift into a \"sense of unity\", Segal relapsed into the uncomfortable state of constant anxiety she had first experienced. At this point she returned to exploring psychological themes from her childhood which included recovered memories of abuse and persistent migraines. Shortly thereafter, in 1997, Segal's health began rapidly deteriorating, and she was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. She died two months later that year, leaving many questions about the root cause of her experience unanswered.\n\nSegal's childhood was filled with attempts to evoke a state of psychological detachment from her identity. She experienced moments which she described as \"vastness\" after repeating her name as a mantra. She started studying Transcendental Meditation and found the experience similarly awakening, but left the organization when she began to dislike the rigidity of the format. Segal moved to California and received a degree in English from the UC Berkeley. She then moved to Paris, where she had a daughter, and where her marked depersonalization experience began. In the fall of 1986 she enrolled in the John F. Kennedy University in their clinical psychology masters program transferring to the Wright Institute's PhD program in the fall of 1987. She completed her dissertation and received her doctorate in Psychology in 1991.\n\nOne day in 1982, while boarding a bus in Paris, the 27-year-old Segal experienced a sudden shift in her consciousness. She described the experience in her book, \"Collisions With the Infinite\":\n\"I lifted my right foot to step up into the bus and collided head-on with an invisible force that entered my awareness like a silently exploding stick of dynamite, blowing the door of my usual consciousness open and off its hinges, splitting me in two. In the gaping space that appeared, what I had previously called 'me' was forcefully pushed out of its usual location inside me into a new location that was approximately a foot behind and to the left of my head. 'I' was now behind my body looking out at the world without using the body's eyes.\"\n\nSegal described this first period of her experience as \"witnessing\", since she was aware of herself but also critically detached from it. This was tremendously unpleasant for her, full of anxiety and fear:\nThe moment the eyes opened the next morning, the mind exploded in worry. Is this insanity? Pscyhosis? Schizophrenia? Is this what people call a nervous breakdown? Depression? What happened? And would it ever stop? ...The mind was in agony as it tried valiantly to make sense of something it could never comprehend, and the body responded to the anguish of the mind by locking itself into survival mode, adrenaline pumping, senses fine-tuned, finding and responding to the threat of annihilation in every moment.\"\n\nHaving a background in meditation, Segal questioned whether this break could be the first step in a positive journey but dismissed it:\n\"The thought did arise that perhaps this experience of witnessing was the state of Cosmic Consciousness Maharishi had described long before as the first stage of awakened awareness. But the mind instantly discarded this possibility because it seemed impossible that the hell realm I was inhabiting could have anything to do with Cosmic Consciousness.\"\n\nIn the years after her break Segal continued to function with seeming normalcy, completing a doctorate in psychology at the Wright Institute. She continued to feel completely depersonalized, literally as if her own name did not refer to anyone. She described it as if her \"...body, mind, speech, thoughts, and emotions were all empty; they had no ownership, no person behind them. I was utterly bereft of all my previous notions of reality\".\n\nSegal's state of mind terrified her, and she sought advice from California's Buddhist community. Buddhism intentionally cultivates loss of ego and a sense of emptiness and oneness, and spiritual teachers tried to help Segal see her condition positively. Several even congratulated her: \"This is a wonderful experience. It has to stay eternally with you. This is perfect freedom. You have become (\"moksha\") of the realized sages,\" read one letter she received.\n\nTwelve years after her initial break, Segal dramatically entered another phase of her experience, centered around a sense of unity of perception between herself and the world: \"In the midst of a particularly eventful week, I was driving north to meet some friends when I suddenly became aware that I was driving through myself. For years there had been no self at all, yet here on this road everything was myself, and I was driving through me to arrive where I already was. In essence, I was going nowhere because I was everywhere already. The infinite emptiness I knew myself to be was now apparent as the infinite substance of everything I saw.\" This sense of cognitive and spiritual oneness remained with Segal for two years, up through the publishing of \"Collisions\" in 1996.\n\nSegal's story also received attention by many writers and publications. \"Collisions\" was reviewed by Yoga Journal magazine in 1997, the reviewer writing, \"This frank and engaging account is a fascinating view of the unfolding of a realization without a spiritual practice or intention.\"\n\nThe 2004 book \"The Biology of Transcendence\" tried to characterize Segal's state of mind during her second phase of union: \"[It was] fusion with 'the vastness' and her discovery that the vastness perceived its universe through her own sensory system, which was at that point the sensory system of the vastness itself...[she] essentially perceived the universe perceiving itself, but without her, that perception did not exist.\"\n\nA 2008 graduate dissertation by Arvin Paul used Segal's experience as an example of \"Shift/s in the Locus of Identity Upon Initial Awakening\", \"a shift from the conventional sense of self to the uninvolved witness, and/or allpervasive presence, and/or boundless spaciousness, and/or pure awareness, and/or Being, and/or emptiness/void, and/or the Self, and/or the simple recognition of nonseparateness.\" Paul quotes Segal: \"That recognition doesn’t change who you really are, ever. You have always been That. And yes, there is a way that the Vastness Itself can perceive Itself so directly, without any fogging or shadowing or taking anything else to be who you are. I guess you could call it a waking up, but what seems most important to convey is that this is who everyone is all the time whether the direct awareness of it is there or not.\"\n\nSegal was interviewed for the chapter devoted to her in the 2003 book \"The Awakening West\" by Lynn Marie Lumiere and John Lumiere-Wins.\n\nAfter Segal's second shift she began sharing her insights with the public and with a group of psychologists in a \"training group\". She says, \" I started training groups for therapists because I want this to be conveyed to those who are in the business of trying to help end suffering\". She wants people to see \"things to be what they are\" instead of pathologizing \"a broad range of human experience\".\n\nAfter her initial break, Segal sought to determine what had happened to her and consulted various psychologists and psychiatrists. Though some had no clear explanation for the experience, one labelled it depersonalization disorder, stating \"I don't know what else it could be but symptoms of depersonalization\". Segal went on to read up on depersonalization, derealization, and dissociation, finding some related to her experience but none were a perfect fit and they ultimately failed to capture the sensation of lacking a self in conjunction with normal, or even improved functioning.\n\nSegal's story was profiled in the 2006 book \"Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self\" by Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugel. It was suggested for a book review in The Journal of the American Psychological Association that rather than representing depersonalization, Segal's experiences may represent a dissociative disorder.\n\nThe 2011 book \"Stranger to My Self: Inside Depersonalization; the Hidden Epidemic\" by Jeffrey Abugel contextualized Segal's experience as following: \"Sometimes, however, even a person well-versed in eastern philosophy may find themselves depersonalized in a way that seems to be anything but part of the road to enlightenment.\" \"Stranger\" noted that Segal's reportedly sudden depersonalization experience was part of a longer—possibly compulsive—history of searching for and at times experiencing that phenomenon:\nAs a young girl, Segal would sometimes repeat her own name in her head over and over. Eventually, \"a threshold was crossed and the identity, as that name, broke like a ship released suddenly from its mooring to float untethered on the ocean waves...Vastness appeared...There was no person to whom that name referred, no identity as that name. No one.\" Then came fear, eventually followed by a return to normalcy. But the compulsion to do the same thing once again always returned. Many people with DPD have cited similar early life incidents. They may involve repeating words until they lose their meaning, or looking intently in the mirror until an overwhelming sense of strangeness emerges. Usually these episodes pass, are forgotten, and remain in the realm of youthful mind games.\n\nYet for Segal, as she became older the episodes became much more prominent rather than less. Segal's autobiography was completed in 1996 and she had begun giving presentations and leading weekly dialogues as well as a \"training group\" for therapists. By late spring Segal began having even more intense experiences in which, \"the vastness became even vaster to itself.\" The experiences entranced her but became increasingly disruptive. By the end of the summer she was exhausted, and doctors encouraged her to rest. Around the same time, she noticed that the fear from years before had returned.\n\nSuzanne spent that fall at her home in Stinson Beach, California. During this period she recovered memories of childhood abuse. Spiritual teacher Stephan Bodian, who counseled Segal during that time wrote, \"They seemed to explain some of the fear she had experienced during the 10 lonely years of being no one before realizing that she was everything. When I suggested that perhaps the fear originated from a part of herself that was split off or dissociated from conscious awareness, she immediately agreed.\"\n\n\"Stranger\" documented this period as a retreat from the earlier spiritual themes that had defined her experience. \"As a psychologist, she was well tutored in a possible ramification of childhood abuse--dissociation. Once again, Segal began to perceive things differently, this time from the psychological viewpoint rather than that of transcendent spirituality.\"\n\nSegal did not have time to discover what the source of her dramatic shifts in perception had been. By February 1997, at the age of 42, her physical and mental capabilities began to quickly decline. She entered the hospital on February 27, and doctors discovered a malignant brain tumor, having surgery but refusing chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nOn March 10 she married her fiancé Steve Kruszynski. After the wedding they traveled to Oklahoma to seek out alternative treatments, but Segal's debilitation returned during the trip and they had to return home, entering a coma several days later.\n\nShe died on the morning of Tuesday, April 1. Bodian described her funeral: Following a Tibetan custom, the body was wrapped in a cloth, surrounded by flowers, and left untouched for three days. On the third day we sat with her body as a local rabbi performed a traditional Jewish ceremony at her mother's request.<br><br>The following Saturday, nearly 100 people gathered to celebrate her life, appreciate her gifts to us, and share our grief. At sunset, her husband, Steve, her fourteen-year-old daughter, Arielle, and her brother Bob waded out into the cold spring surf and scattered her ashes into the sky. \n\nMembers of the spiritual and psychological community went on to debate the significance of her experience. In the afterword to the 1998 edition of \"Collisions\", Bodian gave his personal opinion, \"Those of us who were close to Suzanne never doubted the depth or the authenticity of her realization.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

After showing great skill in his education, he worked his way into Canada as first a linotype operator, then as a reporter for the \"Detroit Free Press\" where he would later meet his future wife Ann Lane, \"née\" Macquire. After settling in Australia with his wife and child, as well as his brother John, he became active in the Australian labour movement, founding the Australian Labour Federation and becoming a prolific journalist for the movement. He authored works covering topics such as labour rights and white nationalism.\n\nAfter becoming disillusioned with the state of Australian politics following an ideological split in the labour movement, he and a group of utopian acolytes (among them influential writer and poet Mary Gilmore) moved to Paraguay in 1892 to found New Australia, with the intention of building a new society on the foundations of his utopian ideals. Following disagreement with the colony regarding the legality of miscegenation and alcohol consumption, he left to found the nearby colony Cosme in May 1894, and later abandoned the project altogether in 1899.\n\nUpon resetting in New Zealand he continued his journalistic endeavours until his death in August 1917. After his death he was both celebrated as a champion of utopian socialism, and condemned as the arrogant leader of a failed new society. Due to his radical politics and his extensive journalistic career, he remains a controversial figure in Australian history.\n\nLane was born in Bristol, England on 6 September 1861, as the eldest son of James Lane, an Irish Protestant landscape gardener, and his English wife Caroline, \"née\" Hall. Lane was born with a debilitating clubfoot, a condition that would be partially corrected in Montreal later in life, leaving him with a limp. Lane's father James was a drunkard who when Lane was born was earning a miserable wage, but later he improved his circumstances and became an employer.\n\nThe young Lane was educated at Bristol Grammar School and demonstrated himself as a gifted student, but he was sent early to work as an office boy. Lane's mother died when he was 14 years of age, and at age 16 he migrated to Canada where he worked odd jobs such as a linotype operator. During this time he began engrossed in the writings of economist Henry George and socialist Edward Bellamy. In 1881 by the age of 24 he became a reporter for the Detroit Free Press, where he would meet his future wife Ann Macquire whom he would marry on 22 July 1883.\n\nIn 1885 William and Ann Lane, along with brother John, as well as their first child migrated to Brisbane, Australia, where Lane immediately got work as a feature writer for the weekly newspaper \"Queensland Figaro\", then as a columnist for the newspapers Brisbane Courier and the Evening Telegraph, using a number of pseudonyms (\"Lucinda Sharpe\", which some consider to be the work of Lane's spouse; \"William Wilcher;\" and \"Sketcher\").\n\nLane's childhood experiences as the son of a drunkard fashioned him into a lifelong abstainer from alcohol. In 1886 he created an Australia-wide sensation by spending a night in the Brisbane lock-up disguised as a drunk, and subsequently reporting the conditions of the cells as \"Henry Harris\". Lane's father was a drunk who impoverished the family.\n\nWith the growth of the Australian labour movement, Lane's columns under the \"Sketcher\" pseudonym, especially his \"Labour Notes\" in the Evening Telegraph, began to increasingly promote labourist philosophy. Lane himself began to attend meetings supporting all manner of popular causes, speaking against repressive laws and practices and Chinese immigrants, all while utilising a charismatic American intonation he had attained during his time in the States.\n\nAfter becoming the de facto editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, Lane left the newspaper during November 1887 to found the weekly \"The Boomerang\", a newspaper described as \"a live newspaper, racy, of the soil\", in which pro-worker themes and lurid racism were brought to a fever-pitch by both \"Sketcher\" and \"Lucinda Sharpe\". He became a powerful supporter of Emma Miller and women's suffrage. A strong proponent of Henry George's Single Tax Movement, Lane became increasingly committed to a radically alternative society, and ended his relationship with the \"Boomerang\" due to its private ownership.\n\nIn May 1890 he began the trade union funded Brisbane weekly \"The Worker\", the rhetoric of which became increasingly threatening towards the employers, the government, and the British Empire itself. The defeat of the 1891 Australian shearers' strike convinced Lane that there would be no real social change without a completely new society, and \"The Worker\" became increasingly devoted to his New Australia utopian idea which would later be made a reality.\n\nThough his efforts were primarily directed towards the non-fictional, Lane was an avid author whose works deeply reflected his political philosophy, as short as his bibliography is. \"The Workingman's Paradise\", an allegorical novel written in sympathy with those involved in the 1891 shearers' strike, was published under his pseudonym \"John Miller\" in early 1892. In the novel Lane articulated the belief that anarchism is the noblest social philosophy of all. Through the novel's philosopher and main protagonist he relates his belief that society may have to experience a period of state socialism to achieve the ideal of Communist anarchism. Mary Gilmore, later a celebrated Australian writer, said in one of her letters that \"the whole book is true and of historical value as Lane transcribed our conversations as well as those of others\".\n\nMost prominent in his bibliography is his novella \"White or Yellow?: A Story of the Race War of A.D. 1908\" (1887). In this work, Lane proposed a horde of Chinese people would legally arrive to Australia, who would then overrun White society and monopolise the industries important to exploiting the natural resources of the \"empty north\" of the continent. As Australian invasion literature, \"White or Yellow?\" reflects Lane's nationalist racialism and left-wing politics within a future history of Australia under attack by the Yellow Peril.\nLane wrote that in the near future, British capitalists would manipulate the legal system and successfully arrange the mass immigration of Chinese workers to Australia, regardless of its socioeconomic consequences to Australian common folk and their society. The economic, cultural, and sexual conflicts that resulted from the capitalists' manipulation of the Australian economy would then provoke a race war throughout the continent, fought between the White settlers and Chinese workers.\n\nThe racialist representations of Yellow Peril ideology in the narrative of \"White or Yellow?\" work to justify forcible expulsion and murder of Chinese workers as an acceptable response to the loss of physical and economic control of Australia. Historically the leaders of the Australian labour and trade unions greatly opposed the importation of Chinese workers, whom they portrayed as an economic threat to Australia due to their eagerness to work for low wages, as well as them presenting a libertine and race-diluting threat to Christian civilisation. Lane's work was intended to act as an apolitical call to racial unity among white Australians.\n\nContriving a division among Australian labour activists between the permanently disaffected and those who later formed the Australian Labor Party, Lane refused the Queensland Government's offer of a grant of land on which to create a utopian settlement, and began an Australia-wide campaign for the creation of a new society elsewhere on the globe, peopled by rugged and sober Australian bushmen and their proud wives.\n\nEventually Paraguay was decided upon, and Lane and his family and hundreds of acolytes (238 total) from New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia departed Mort Bay in Sydney in the ship \"Royal Tar\" on 1 July 1893.\n\nNew Australia soon had its crisis, brought on by the issues of interracial relationships (Lane singled out the Guarani as racially taboo) and alcohol. Lane's dictatorial manner soon alienated many in the community, and by the time the second boatload of utopians arrived from Adelaide in 1894, Lane had left with a core of devotees to form a new colony nearby named Cosme.\n\nEventually Lane became disillusioned with the process, and returned to Australia in 1899.\n\nLane then went with his family to New Zealand. After initial melancholia, he soon refound his old verve as a pseudonymous feature writer from 1900 for the newspaper \"New Zealand Herald\" (\"Tohunga\"), only this time as ultra-conservative and pro-Empire. He had retained the strong racial antipathy toward East Asians he expressed in his literature, and during World War I he developed extreme anti-German sentiments. He died on 26 August 1917 in Auckland, New Zealand, having been editor of the \"Herald\" from 1913 to 1917, much admired, having lost one son Charles at a cricket match in Cosme in Paraguay, and another Donald on the first day of the ANZAC landings (25 April 1915) on the beaches of Gallipoli.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13656838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13656838", "title": "Yvonne Jones", "text": "Yvonne Jones\n\nYvonne Jean Jones (born March 15, 1968) is a Canadian politician of Inuit descent in Newfoundland and Labrador, who was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election on May 13, 2013. She represents the district of Labrador as a member of the Liberal Party caucus. On December 2, 2015, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2013, Jones represented the district of Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. During her career in provincial politics, she served as Minister of Fisheries in Premier Roger Grimes' government, and later as a leader of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador and Leader of the Official Opposition.\n\nJones served as mayor of Mary's Harbour, Labrador from 1991 to 1996. In 1996, she sought the Liberal Party nomination for the provincial electoral district of Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair in that year's general election. Jones lost the nomination to incumbent Danny Dumaresque, but subsequently ran as an Independent candidate. She was elected to the House of Assembly in the 1996 general election, defeating Dumaresque, a two-term MHA. Jones became the Liberal Party's candidate for the 1999 election. She was re-elected in 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011.\n\nAfter serving two years as a Parliamentary Secretary Jones was appointed to cabinet In February 2003, by Premier Roger Grimes. She was sworn in as the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture and as the Minister Responsible for the Status of Women. Jones held the post till the Liberal government was defeated in the provincial election in October of that year.\n\nJones was one of only three Liberal Members of the House of Assembly (MHA) re-elected in the 2007 provincial election. On November 15, 2007, she was named the interim leader of the Liberal Party and Official Opposition Leader, after party leader Gerry Reid was defeated in his own district. Jones became the first woman to lead the Liberal Party in the province. The party originally planned to hold a leadership convention to select a new, permanent leader in 2008, but postponed the vote twice. Jones continued to serve as interim leader during this period of time, and in December 2009, announced her intention to run for the permanent leadership when the convention was to be scheduled. On July 30, 2010, Jones was acclaimed Liberal leader after she was the only person to file nomination papers for the position.\n\nShe was expected to be sworn in as leader at the party's convention in November of that year, however the convention was delayed when Jones announced in August that she would be taking a leave of absence from her position to undergo treatment for breast cancer. She returned to work in early 2011, and was sworn in as Liberal leader at the party's Spring leadership convention.\n\nOn October 27, 2009, the district of The Straits – White Bay North held a by-election, to replace Minister of Transportation and Works, Trevor Taylor, who resigned on October 2, 2009. Liberal candidate Marshall Dean won the election taking nearly 48% of the vote and defeating the Progressive Conservative candidate by 126 votes.\n\nUnder Jones' leadership the Liberal Party remained in second place in public opinion polls. After receiving 22% in the 2007 general election, the party's support has not risen above those levels. For the majority of time since the election their support has been in the mid-teens according to polls conducted by Corporate Research Associates (CRA). Jones' own popularity had consistently remained lower than her own party's; CRA's quarterly polls on Newfoundland and Labrador politics have found that no more than 11% of those surveyed have felt Jones would make the best premier. A NTV Telelink poll conducted in February 2011, found that 13% of decided voters would support the Liberal Party and that 12% thought Jones was the best choice to be premier.\n\nThe results of the NTV Telelink poll led former Liberal provincial and federal cabinet minister John Efford to criticize Jones's leadership. Efford said that Jones would not become premier and while he did not call on her to resign as leader, he did say that \"it's clear what she ought to do in the face of poor polling results\".\n\nA CRA poll in March 2011, saw Jones' personal popularity rise to 18%, her highest level since becoming Liberal leader in 2007. Her personal popularity was also tied with that of her party. On June 7, 2011, CRA released a poll showing that Jones' popularity had dropped slightly to 16% but her party's support had risen to 22%. While the Progressive Conservatives still held a large lead in the poll, at 57%, the Liberals were statistically tied with the New Democrats, who had the support of 20% of those surveyed.\n\nOn August 9, 2011, two months before the provincial election, Jones announced that she was resigning as leader due to a slower recovery from breast cancer than she expected. She sought re-election in her district during the 2011 provincial election, and won 71 per cent of the popular vote.\n\nIn April 2013, Jones resigned her seat in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly to run as the Liberal candidate in the federal by-election in Labrador created by the resignation of Peter Penashue. She defeated Penashue to win the seat on May 13, 2013. She was sworn in on June 4, 2013.\n\nUpon her Election, Jones was appointed the Liberal critic for Northern Development, the Northern Economic Development Agency, the Arctic Council, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, and Search and Rescue. In August 2013, Jones was elected Chair of the Liberal Party of Canada Newfoundland and Labrador caucus. In February 2014, she became Vice-Chair of the Public Accounts committee.\n\nOn December 2, 2015, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs.\n\n \n\n"}
