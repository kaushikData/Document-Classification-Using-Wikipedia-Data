{"id": "52928045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52928045", "title": "Alice Campion", "text": "Alice Campion\n\nAlice Campion is the pseudonym of a group of Australian writers who have published two collaborative novels, \"The Painted Sky\" (Random House, 2015; published in German as \"Der Bunte Himmel,\" Ullstein Verlag 2015), and \"The Shifting Light\" (Penguin Random House, 2017). The group promotes collaborative fiction writing through workshops, public lectures, and the internet.\nAlice Campion consists of four core members: Denise Tart, a Sydney civil celebrant with a background in writing and performance; Jane Richards, a senior travel editor with Australian media group Fairfax; Jane St Vincent Welch (full name Mary Jane St Vincent Welch), an Australian film editor; and Jenny Crocker, a communications manager specialising in behaviour change campaigns. For its first novel, the Alice Campion group also included Madeline Oliver.\nThe Alice Campion collaborators met as members of an inner-city book club in Sydney, Australia, The Book Sluts. In 2010, while discussing Crime and Punishment, five members of the group decided spontaneously to write a ‘bestseller’ in order to fund a trip to Russia. What began as a light-hearted attempt to write a run-of-the-mill romance soon developed into a more serious attempt to write a quality genre novel. The group was also motivated by the lack of collaborative writing in commercial fiction. While other forms of creative writing – notably screenwriting for television and movies – thrived on collaboration, multi-author novels were rare, and the few that did exist were experimental, avant garde works, such as Wu Ming, or spoofs. \n<br>\nOther successful collaborative pairs writing commercial Australian literature include Thomas Kenneally and his daughter Meg Kenneally as well as Florence James and Dymphna Cusack, who wrote the classic Australian novel Come In Spinner. Alice Campion remains the only multi-member commercial fiction group collaboration in the world.\n\nThe Alice Campion authors, as Group Fiction, have outlined their writing process in detail and with examples of key documents in their e-book \"How to Write Fiction as a Group\". Generally, the group meets on a Sunday to develop the plot of the book. This involves breaking the existing story into short scenes of around two to four pages. The group collaboratively decides what will happen in each scene: the action, setting the point of view, impacts on the emotion and knowledge of the participating character and the tone. Each writer then takes a single scene away and writes it as a draft. Scenes must be written and circulated to the other writers ahead of the next meeting, which generally takes place on a Thursday. At this Revision Meeting, each writer reads her own scene out loud and other participants have an opportunity to suggest improvements, which are integrated or not by agreement. In subsequent drafts, scenes are re-written by someone other than the original author and edited collaboratively to ensure a smooth and seamless narrative. Disagreements are decided by a vote. \n\n\nFollowing its publication in 2015, \"The Painted Sky\" drew attention from the Australian media. The Alice Campion authors have presented at numerous events, workshops and festivals including the Japan Writers’ Conference, the inaugural St Albans Writers’ Festival, the New South Wales Writers' Centre, the Society of Women Writers (NSW), the State Library NSW, the NSW Writers' Centre, and for Writers Victoria at the Wheeler Centre in Melbourne. Following the publication of \"The Shifting Light\" in 2017, the Alices appeared at the Sydney Writers' Festival and ran a workshop on how to write collaborative fiction.\n\n"}

They were scheduled to begin the first of several surgeries to separate them at Rainbow Babies and Children's Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio. However, in August 2007 the surgery was called off as too dangerous.\n\nThe twins were born in Rome, Italy to Romanian parents, Alin Dogaru, a Byzantine Catholic priest, and Claudia Dogaru, a nurse. Their mother heard about the successful separation of Egyptian-born twins who were also joined at the head and hoped her children could also be successfully separated. The Dogaru family — who also have an older daughter, Maria, and younger son Theodor — were brought to north Texas by the World Craniofacial Foundation to have Anastasia and Tatiana evaluated for possible separation.\n\nThe girls are currently developing normally for their age and speak both Romanian and English. They get around with Anastasia leading the way and Tatiana following. The top of Tatiana's head is attached to the back of Anastasia's. Anastasia, whose kidneys don't function, relies on her sister's kidneys, and Tatiana on her sister's circulatory system. The girls also share blood flow to the back of the brain and some brain matter. Doctors estimated the twins had only a 50 percent chance of surviving the surgery. There were also risks of complications, such as brain damage, but the girls also risk early death if they remain conjoined. Their parents believed separation would give them their best chance at living a normal life.\n\nIn May 2007, doctors used a catheter to insert wire coils into the veins of the two girls, successfully redirecting their blood flow. It was the first time the procedure was attempted in conjoined twins. Doctors pushed back the first of the planned separation surgeries to June 2007 while studying the complex circulatory system of the twins, but, in August of that year, decided it was too risky.\n\n"}
{"id": "858035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=858035", "title": "Barbara Gordon", "text": "Barbara Gordon\n\nBarbara Gordon is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. The character was created by William Dozier, Julius Schwartz, and Carmine Infantino. At the request of the producers of the 1960s \"Batman\" television series, DC editor Schwartz called for a new female counterpart to the superhero Batman that could be introduced into publication and the third season of the show simultaneously. The character subsequently made her first comic book appearance as Batgirl in \"Detective Comics\" #359, titled \"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!\" (January 1967), by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino.\n\nBarbara Gordon is the daughter of Gotham City police commissioner James Gordon, the sister of James Gordon Jr., and is initially employed as head of the Gotham City Public Library. Although the character appeared in various DC Comics publications, she was prominently featured in \"Batman Family\" which debuted in 1975, partnered with the original Robin, Dick Grayson. In 1988, following the editorial retirement of the character's Batgirl persona in \"Batgirl Special\" #1, the graphic novel \"\" depicts the Joker shooting her through the spinal cord in her civilian identity, resulting in paraplegia. In subsequent stories, the character was reestablished as a computer expert and information broker known as Oracle. Providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other superheroes, she makes her first appearance as Oracle in \"Suicide Squad\" #23 (1989) and later became a featured lead of the \"Birds of Prey\" series. Reverting the character to her Batgirl persona, DC Comics relaunched its comic book titles in 2011 during The New 52 event, featuring her in the eponymous \"Batgirl\" monthly title as well as \"Birds of Prey\". These changes were retained for the second company wide relaunch in 2016 known as DC Rebirth.\n\nThe character was a popular comic book figure during the Silver Age of Comic Books, due to her appearances in the \"Batman\" television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of Comic Books under the \"Birds of Prey\" publication and as a disabled icon. The character has been the subject of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of \"The Killing Joke\", which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.\n\nAs both Batgirl and Oracle, Barbara Gordon has been featured in various adaptations related to the Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. The character has been portrayed by Yvonne Craig and Dina Meyer and has been voiced by Melissa Gilbert, Tara Strong, Danielle Judovits, Alyson Stoner, Mae Whitman, Kimberly Brooks and Rosario Dawson, among others. In 2011, she was ranked 17th in IGN's \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\".\n\nPrior to the introduction of Barbara Gordon, the Batwoman character and her sidekick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications, but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the \"Batman\" television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating \"Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the '50s but she had nothing to do with a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show.\" Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show's third season.\n\nBarbara Gordon and her alter ego Batgirl debuted in \"Detective Comics\" #359, \"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl\" (1967), as the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon. In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, sporting a black bodysuit with yellow gloves, boots, utility belt and a bat-symbol along with a blue cape and cowl (similar to Batman's), Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the super villain Killer Moth, attracting Batman's attention and leading to a crime-fighting career. Although Batman insists she give up crime-fighting because of her gender, Batgirl disregards his objections.\n\nIn her civilian identity, Barbara Gordon, Ph.D., is depicted as a career woman with a doctorate in library science, as well as being head of Gotham City public library, \"presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality.\" She was given a regular backup slot in \"Detective Comics\" starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon's Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in \"Detective Comics\" #417 (1971), stating: \"I'd like to say a few words about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back ... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman's life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime-fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [by] Batman.\"\n\nBatgirl continues to appear in DC Comics publications throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, as a supporting character in \"Detective Comics\", in addition to guest appearances in various titles such as \"Justice League of America\", \"World's Finest Comics\", \"The Brave and the Bold\", \"Action Comics\", and \"Superman\". In the mid-1970s, Batgirl reveals her secret identity to her father (who had already discovered it on his own) and serves as a member of the United States House of Representatives. She moves to Washington, D.C., intending to give up her career as Batgirl and in June 1972, appeared in a story entitled \"Batgirl's Last Case.\" Julius Schwartz brought her back a year later in \"Superman\" #268 (1973), in which she has a blind date with Clark Kent, establishing their friendship, and fights alongside Superman. Batgirl and Superman team up twice more, in \"Superman\" #279 and \"DC Comics Presents\" #19.\n\nBatgirl also guest-starred in other Superman related titles such as \"Adventure Comics\", and in \"Superman Family\" #171, where she teams with Supergirl. The character is given a starring role in DC's \"Batman Family\" comic book which debuted in 1975. The original Robin Dick Grayson became her partner in the series and the two were frequently referred to as the \"Dynamite Duo: Batgirl & Robin.\" Batgirl meets Batwoman in \"Batman Family\" #10, when the retired superhero briefly returns to crime-fighting (before Kane is murdered by the Bronze Tiger). The two fight Killer Moth and Cavalier, and learn each other's secret identities. Batwoman retires once again at the conclusion of the story, leaving Batgirl to continue crime-fighting. Although this series ended after three years of publication, Batgirl continued to appear in back up stories published in \"Detective Comics\" through issue #519 (October 1982).\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", a limited miniseries published in 1985, was written in order to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity. Although Batgirl is a featured character, her role is relatively small—she delivers Supergirl's eulogy in issue seven of the 12-part series. The conclusion of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" changed DC Universe continuity in many ways. Following the reboot, Barbara Gordon is born to Roger and Thelma Gordon, and she is Jim Gordon's niece/adopted daughter in current canon. Post-\"Crisis\", Supergirl does not arrive on Earth until after Gordon has established herself as Oracle; many adventures she shared with Batgirl are retroactively described as having been experienced by Power Girl. In \"Secret Origins #20: Batgirl and the Golden Age Dr. Mid-Nite\" (1987), Barbara Gordon's origin is rebooted by author Barbara Randall. Within the storyline, Gordon recounts the series of events that led to her career as Batgirl, including her first encounter with Batman as a child, studying martial arts under the tutelage of a sensei, memorizing maps and blue prints of the city, excelling in academics in order to skip grades, and pushing herself to become a star athlete.\n\nDC officially retired the hero in the one-shot comic \"Batgirl Special\" #1 (July 1988), written by Barbara Kesel.\n\nLater that year, Barbara Gordon appeared in Alan Moore's \"Batman: The Killing Joke\". In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara in an attempt to drive her father insane, thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised. Although events in \"The Killing Joke\" exert a great impact on the character, the story has little to do with her. She is employed as a plot device to cement the Joker's vendetta against Commissioner Gordon and Batman. In 2006, during an interview with \"Wizard\", Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character calling it \"shallow and ill-conceived.\" He stated prior to writing the graphic novel, \"I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon—who was Batgirl at the time—and if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project\", and following a discussion with then-Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano, \"Len got back onto the phone and said, 'Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'\" Although there has been speculation as to whether or not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character's paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of \"Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed\" (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the \"Batgirl Special\" specifically to retire the character and set her in place for \"The Killing Joke\".\n\nFollowing the release of the graphic novel, comic book editor and writer Kim Yale discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband, fellow comic writer John Ostrander. Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity, the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability.\n\nGail Simone would include the character's paralysis in a list of \"major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered\", dubbing the phenomenon \"Women in Refrigerators\" in reference to a 1994 \"Green Lantern\" story where the title character discovers his girlfriend's mutilated body in his refrigerator.\n\nYale and Ostrander oversaw the development of Barbara Gordon's new persona as Oracle for the next several years. The character made her first comic book appearance as Oracle in \"Suicide Squad\" #23, anonymously offering her services to the government's Task Force X. In the following two years, Oracle, under pen of Ostrander and Yale, made guest appearances in various DC titles until her identity was revealed to be Barbara Gordon in \"Suicide Squad\" #38 (1990) and she officially becomes a member of the Squad in issue #48 following an invitation from Amanda Waller. In 1992, Dennis O'Neil wrote Oracle as Batman's sole source of information in \"Batman: Sword of Azrael #1\". This newly forged partnership established Oracle's status as Batman's intellectual equal. She is subsequently featured in the 12-issue miniseries \"The Hacker Files\" (1993). In \"Oracle: Year One\"—a story arc contained in \"The Batman Chronicles\" #5 (1996)—Yale and Ostrander tell the origin of Barbara Gordon's new persona as Oracle. Initially, Gordon's paralysis plunges her into a state of reactive depression. However, she soon realizes that her aptitude for and training in information sciences have provided her with tremendous skills that could be deployed to fight crime.\n\nIn a world increasingly centered on technology and information, she possesses a genius-level intellect; photographic memory; deep knowledge of computers and electronics; expert skills as a hacker; and graduate training in library sciences. One night, she has a dream in which an all-knowing woman (similar to Oracle at Delphi of Greek mythology) has her own face; it's then that she adopts \"Oracle\" as her codename. She serves as an information broker, gathering and disseminating intelligence to law enforcement organizations and members of the superhero community. She trains under the tutelage of Richard Dragon, one of DC's premiere martial artists, to engage in combat (using eskrima) from her wheelchair. She develops her upper-body strength and targeting skills with both firearms and batarangs.\n\nThe success of Chuck Dixon's \"Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey\" (1996) led to the comic series \"Birds of Prey\" starring the two title characters. During Chuck Dixon's crossover series \"Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle\", Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form the nucleus of the Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first \"Batgirl\" monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of \"Birds of Prey\" with issue #56. In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: \"Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator and one of the most fascinating characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She's fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she's tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place.\" Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon's origin with the miniseries \"\". Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths.\nDuring the 2004 crossover event \"\", Black Mask commandeers Oracle's computers and satellites and engages in a fight to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's \"Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn\" (2005), and \"Birds of Prey: The Battle Within\" (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.\n\nDuring the company-wide crossover \"Infinite Crisis\" (2005), Oracle teams with the Martian Manhunter in Metropolis to coordinate a counterstrike against the Secret Society's global jailbreak. The renewed romance between Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson is also cut short by the \"Infinite Crisis\" storyline.\n\nWhen DC continuity jumps forward one year after the events of \"Infinite Crisis\", Oracle and her team continue to work in Metropolis. Oracle works with Batman, although not on a regular basis as before. Oracle continues to lead the Birds of Prey, and expands the ranks of the operation. In \"Birds of Prey\" #99, Black Canary leaves the team and the Huntress becomes the team's \"de facto\" field leader, while Big Barda is brought in as the group's heavy-hitter alongside a larger, rotating roster. Oracle also makes an attempt to reforge her alliance with Power Girl. However, when Oracle invites her to rejoin the team, she replies that she will do so \"when Hell freezes over.\"\n\nIn the crossover event \"Countdown to Final Crisis\" (2007), Oracle dispatches the Question and Batwoman to capture Trickster and Piper following their role in the murder of Bart Allen. She struggles to keep the identities of the world's heroes from being stolen and coordinates the response to a global crisis engineered by the Calculator, a villainous hacker and information broker. In \"The All-New Booster Gold\" #5 (2007), the title hero is given the mission of traveling back in time in order to prevent \"a tragedy that he discovers never should've happened—the Joker shooting and paralyzing Barbara Gordon, Batgirl.\" Although Booster Gold makes several attempts to prevent the events which took place in \"Batman: The Killing Joke\", he ultimately fails and Barbara Gordon's chronological history remains unchanged. Rip Hunter convinces him that Barbara's destiny is to become Oracle. Later, Batman reveals that he kept Joker's photos of Barbara and Booster Gold for years and waited until Booster Gold's correct age before confronting him. Batman then thanks Booster Gold for trying to stop the Joker and offers him his friendship.\n\nIn \"Whitewater\", Gail Simone's final story arc on \"Birds of Prey\" (2007), Oracle and her team struggle for power with Spy Smasher, a government agent who has taken over the Birds of Prey organization. Eventually, Spy Smasher is forced to admit her defeat and returns control of the Birds of Prey organization to Oracle. At the conclusion of the arc, Oracle also adopts Misfit into the Birds of Prey. Sean McKeever temporarily took over as author of \"Birds of Prey\", writing issues #113–117, \"Birds of Prey: Metropolis or Dust\" (2008). The following arc of the series \"Birds of Prey: Platinum Flats\" (2008) is written by Tony Bedard. In the company-wide 2008 \"Final Crisis\" storyline, Darkseid—who has finally gained control of the Anti-Life Equation—attempts to put the mind-control equation on the internet. Both Oracle and Mister Terrific make desperate attempts to stop Darkseid, even attempting to shut down the entire Internet. Unfortunately, they both fail and those affected ended up mindless slaves of Darkseid. Freed from Darkseid's control after the restoration of the Multiverse, she attempts to shut down the criminal \"Unternet\" set up by her opposite number, the Calculator, as a Darkseid-free replacement for the regular Internet and still used by tech-savvy criminals. However, the Calculator, preventing her moves, takes control of the Kilg%re, gaining the ability to thrive in cyberspace by controlling digital and cybernetic avatars, and tracks Oracle down with his newfound powers. Even though Oracle foils him, she starts doubting her abilities and fears she's losing her edge and brilliance, which results in her disbanding the Birds of Prey team to do some soul-searching. \"Birds of Prey\" received cancellation in early 2009, with the final issue being #127.\n\nOracle is subsequently featured in \"Oracle: The Cure\", a limited series written by Kevin VanHook and a crossover arc with \"\" (2009). The story chronologically follows the events of \"Final Crisis\" and \"Batman R.I.P.\" (2008). Oracle has returned to Gotham, and although the Birds of Prey are disbanded, she continues to summon them to help Nightwing and Robin deal with the growing crime in Gotham. The Calculator's plans finally come to their fruition, and Kuttler, hoping to save his dying daughter Wendy takes on the \"Babbage\" alias and begins prowling the digital world of \"Alta Viva\", a virtual world game, for fragments of the Anti-Life Equation unleashed by Darkseid. Oracle, now living in a dilapidated rented apartment in Gotham, becomes aware of Kuttler's activities after \"Cheesefiend\", one of her informants, is brutally killed, with the Anti-Life Equation itself, after coming in contact with Babbage. Hoping to stop the Calculator and prevent him from piecing together the fragments of the Anti-Life Equation in his possession, Oracle travels to Hong Kong, hoping to steal them back by the means of an advanced supercomputer programmed to track the chunk of data left behind by Babbage. However the Calculator discovers her attempts, swearing vengeance upon her. She manages to defeat Calculator, rendering the Anti-Life Equation's fragments useless.\n\nIn 2009, the \"Batgirl\" comic book was relaunched with Stephanie Brown starring as the title character. Although Oracle initially tries to discourage Brown from crime-fighting, she eventually comes to accept her as Batgirl. In addition, she also mentors the Calculator's daughter, Wendy Harris, who was crippled following an attack at Titans Tower. Oracle later takes a job as an assistant professor at Gotham University. During the Green Lantern limited series \"Blackest Night\", Hal Jordan crashes into the Bat-Signal after a fight with the Black Lantern Martian Manhunter. Oracle and Commissioner Gordon are both present. \"Origins & Omens\" hints towards an involvement in the storyline. After sending Green Lantern's intel to every superhero community across the planet of the Black Lanterns, the Gordons find themselves being attacked by the original Dark Knight's deceased rogue gallery members, who are all reanimated by the Black Lantern Corps. Oracle and her father are forced to fight for their lives as they witness the Black Lanterns massacring everyone on sight at Gotham Central. During the crisis, Oracle is rendered unconscious by an explosion and is possessed by Deadman, who uses Oracle's body to save Commissioner Gordon from the reanimated King Snake and the Trigger Twins. After being rescued by Batman, Robin, and Red Robin, the Gordons were attacked by Batman and Red Robin's parents with their saviors, the reanimated Graysons and the Drakes. While Grayson and Drake battle the Black Lanterns, Robin takes the Gordons to their underground base where Alfred tends her and her father's wounds.\n\nIn Greg Rucka's \"Detective Comics\" #862, Barbara Gordon is approached by Huntress and Renee Montoya (the new Question) for help in tracking down a mysterious criminal who ordered a hit on them. Montoya is flabbergasted upon discovering that \"Commissioner Gordon's daughter\" is a superhero. In 2010, \"Birds of Prey\" was relaunched with Gail Simone returning to write the comic. The first arc is a tie-in with the Green Lantern \"Brightest Day\" limited series. Oracle reforms the Birds of Prey, this time with Dove and the recently resurrected Hawk as members. A new villainess calling herself the White Canary begins menacing the Birds, and publicly reveals Black Canary's civilian identity and frames her for a murder. While the team contends with White Canary in the streets of Gotham, Oracle is kidnapped by her former associates, Savant and Creote. This is eventually revealed to be a ruse in order to trick White Canary. Following the team's victory against White Canary, Oracle fakes her death during a battle with Calculator. With most of the criminal underworld now believing that she is dead, Oracle cuts off ties with all but a select few Gotham heroes, and is shown refusing to help Blue Beetle, Manhunter, and Booster Gold when they attempt to call her for assistance during battle.\n\nIn Grant Morrison's \"Batman: The Return\" (2010), an installment of the limited series \"\" (2010), Batman enlists Oracle to help him run Batman Incorporated, a new global team of Batmen. He tasks her with helping him fight crime on a virtual front, and shows her a new modified Batgirl design that acts as her virtual avatar. Oracle is later shown directing Cassandra Cain, now known as Blackbat, on a mission in Hong Kong, where she captures some heroin smugglers for Batman. In Scott Snyder's \"Black Mirror\" storyline, Barbara Gordon is kidnapped by her brother, James Gordon Jr., who had returned to Gotham after a lengthy absence to become a serial killer. He stabs her in both of her legs, positioning the knives so that if she removes them, she will bleed to death. As she slowly bleeds, she is able to use her wits to distract him long enough for Batman and Commissioner Gordon to arrive and defeat her brother.\n\nIn September, 2011, following the company-wide relaunch, Barbara Gordon stars in a new \"Batgirl\" series—one of The New 52 titles featuring the company's most iconic characters. The conclusion of the limited series \"Flashpoint\" (2011) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to a younger age and earlier stage in their careers, while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting to issue #1, \"our creative teams have the ability to take a more modern approach—not only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters.\" Wayne also stated that \"\"The Killing Joke\" still happened and she was Oracle. Now she will go through physical rehabilitation and become a more seasoned and nuanced character because she had these incredible and diverse experiences. Public reaction to the change has been mixed, and has included criticism that DC has reduced the diversity of their character lineup, as well as \"being disrespectful of the power the character had gained as a symbol to the disabled community in her role as Oracle.\"<ref name=\"OP/ED: ORACLE Is Stronger Than BATGIRL Will Ever Be\"></ref>\n\nDC Comics co-publisher Dan DiDio explained the decision by stating that \"[w]e didn't want to turn our back on the diversity issue, but she'll always be the most recognizable [Batgirl]. We are working with concerns to diversify the line. We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience.\" Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: \"For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It's a bit of a shock, to be sure, but we're doing everything we can to be respectful to this character's amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time ... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling.\"\n\nIn the new, revised continuity, the events of \"The Killing Joke\" took place three years before the current storyline, and while it is established she was paraplegic during that time, Barbara Gordon is written as having regained her mobility after undergoing experimental surgery at a South African clinic. Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is \"one of the smartest and toughest women in comics ... One thing the book is truly about, is that the after-effects of something like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or other trauma-related syndromes, can strike even very smart, very intellectually tough people, even soldiers and cops\", a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books. She also explained the method of the character's recovery is based upon real life experiences in that \"some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from South Africa. People have been talking about this as if it's some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead, but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases. Barbara's spine was not severed. That makes her a candidate.\"\n\nPrior to release, \"Batgirl\" #1 sold out at the distribution level with over 100,000 copies printed in its first run according to Diamond Comic Distributors. Along with \"Action Comics\" #1, \"Justice League\" #1, \"Batman\" #1, \"Batman and Robin\" #1, \"\" #1, \"Detective Comics\" #1, \"Flash\" #1, \"Green Lantern\" #1, and \"Superman\" #1, retailers were required to order a second printing. Calvin Reid of \"Publishers Weekly\" states in a review of the first issue: \"The artwork is okay though conventional, while Simone's script tries to tie up of the end of the previous Barbara Gordon/Oracle storyline and setup up the new Batgirl. Her formula: murderous villains, blood splattering violence and high flying superheroics mixed with single-white-female bonding ... plus a cliffhanger ending to the first issue that offers a nifty [segue] into the new world of Barbara Gordon and Batgirl.\" \"The New York Times\" critic George Gene Gustines wrote: \"Unlike some of the other DC comics I read this week, Batgirl achieves a deft hat trick: a well-shaped reintroduction to a character, an elegant acknowledgement of fundamental history and the establishment of a new status quo. This is a must-buy series.\" Earning a B+ rating in a review from \"Entertainment Weekly\", Ken Tucker writes that Simone \"[takes] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl. The result is a burst of exhilaration, as Barbara/Batgirl revels in her new freedom even as she encounters a so-far not-terribly-chilling villain called Mirror.\"\n\nSince the series relaunch in September 2011, \"Batgirl\" has remained within the top 30 of the 300 best-selling monthly comic book publications sold in North America. Monthly estimated sales figures are as follows: \"Batgirl\" #1 with 81,489 copies (ranked 12th overall), \"Batgirl\" #2 with 75,227 (ranked 14th), \"Batgirl\" #3 with 62,974 (ranked 18th), \"Batgirl\" #4 with 53,975 (ranked 23rd), \"Batgirl\" #5 with 51,327 (ranked 26th), and \"Batgirl\" #6 with 47,836 (ranked 30th). The hardcover edition of volume 1, \"Batgirl: The Darkest Reflection\", which collects issues #1-6, made \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, alongside \"Animal Man: The Hunt\", \"Batman & Robin: Born to Kill\", \"Batman: Detective Comics\", \"Wonder Woman: Blood\", \"Batwoman: Hydrology\", \"Green Lantern: Sinestro\".\n\nAdditionally, Barbara Gordon makes an appearance in \"Birds of Prey\" #1, where Black Canary offers her a spot on the new Birds of Prey roster. She declines Canary's invitation, suggesting that Katana take her place instead. Series writer Duane Swierczynski has stated that Batgirl will join the team in issue #4. He commented that while she \"is an essential part of this team\", she is not the focus of the series, as she is hesitant to be associated with the other characters because of their status as outlaws.\n\nIn October 2014, the monthly Batgirl title underwent a soft reboot with the new creative team Brenden Fletcher (writer) Cameron Stewart (writer, layouts), Babs Tarr (artist) and Maris Wicks (colors). The first six-issue story explored Barbara Gordon's attempt to start a new life as a PhD student in the hip Gotham borough of Burnside. While seemingly light and engaging compared to Gail Simone's darker preceding run, the new arc ultimately dealt with Babs' inability to fully escape her and the villain was revealed as her own brain scans, an algorithm similar to the pre-New 52 Oracle. While the reboot was highly praised for its innovative use of social media, its fun and energy, and particularly for Tarr's art, several critics condemned the villain Dagger Type in issue #37 as a transphobic caricature. In response, the creative team issued a joint apology and revised the issue for the subsequent collected edition, \"Batgirl Vol. 1: The Batgirl of Burnside\".\n\nOn March 13, 2015 DC Comics released 25 Joker-themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June, in celebration of the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to \"Batgirl\" #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from \"The Killing Joke\". The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.\nThe cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew hundreds of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, \"My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.\"\n\nIn March 2016, DC Comics announced it would be relaunching all of its monthly titles in an initiative called DC Rebirth. The relaunch restored elements of the pre-\"Flashpoint\" DC continuity while maintaining elements of The New 52 as well. The DC Rebirth Batgirl would remain Barbara Gordon, who would star in two monthly series: \"Batgirl\" (Volume 5), written by Hope Larson, and \"Batgirl and the Birds of Prey\" (Volume 1), written by Julie Benson and Shawna Benson. The two comic book titles debuted in July and August 2016, respectively. In volume five of \"Batgirl\", Barbara Gordon is a student attending Burnside College in the trendy Burnside neighborhood of Gotham City.\n\nVarious alterations of the Barbara Gordon character have appeared in storylines published in and out of mainstream continuity titles. Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories which involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series \"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time\", a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as \"Elseworlds\" and \"All Star DC Comics\" have also featured alternate versions of the character.\n\nBarbara Gordon, as both Batgirl and Oracle, has made several appearances in \"Elseworlds\" comics since 1997. The \"Elseworlds\" imprint takes the company's iconic characters and places them in alternate timelines, places and events making heroes \"as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow.\" The character is given starring roles in the noir-style storyline \"Thrillkiller: Batgirl & Robin\" (1997), its sequel \"Batgirl + Batman: Thrillkiller '62\" (1998), and the one-shot comic \"\" (1998), all of which depict worlds where Barbara is Gotham's first bat-themed hero (Bruce Wayne is a police detective who becomes Batman in the 1960s-set \"Thrillkiller\" series, and merely serves as essentially her 'Alfred' in \"Elseworld's Finest\" in a timeline where Jim Gordon was killed rather than the Waynes).\nIn addition, the character has supporting roles in \"\" (1998), \"\" (2000), \"\" (2003), \"\" (2006), and \"\" (2012). A version of her appears as \"Nightwing\" in the Smallville comic series, replacing Stephanie Brown as previously promoted.\n\nIn 2005, DC Comics launched its \"All Star\" imprint—an ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company's most iconic characters with the most acclaimed writers and artists in the industry. Similar to \"Elseworlds\", \"All Star\" is not restricted to continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership. According to Dan DiDio, \"[t]hese books are created to literally reach the widest audience possible, and not just the comic book audience, but anyone who has ever wanted to read or see anything about Superman or Batman.\"\n\nAn alternate Barbara Gordon was adapted into Frank Miller's \"All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder\" (2005) as a teenage Batgirl. In addition, another variation of the character had been set to star in an eponymous \"All Star Batgirl\" title, written by Geoff Johns; however, the series was canceled prior to publication.\n\nIn \"\" #1 (Nov. 2014), set in an alternate future, a trio of Batgirls include Casandra Cain, Stephanie Brown and newcomer Tiffany Fox—the daughter of Lucius Fox and the first African American character to be portrayed as Batgirl.\n\nIn 2015, DC began publishing \"DC Bombshells\", a title that places its characters in an alternate history primarily set during the 1930s and 1940s. In Digital Issue 42 (collected in Print Issue 14), Harley Quinn tells Pamela Isley about encountering \"the Belle of the Bog\", who appears to be a vampire version of Batgirl. \"DC Comics Bombshells Annual #1\", published on 31 August 2016, reveals that Barbara Gourdon was a French fighter pilot during World War I. After she lost her boyfriend during the war, she traveled to Louisiana and did indeed become a vampire.\n\nIn the aftermath of \"Batman: The Killing Joke\", Barbara Gordon's paralysis has been the subject of debate, with arguments in favor of, and against, restoring her mobility. Writers, artists, editorial staff and critics have spoken in great length about the nature of subject, citing responses from readership, issues of sexism, diversity and representation, as well as other considerations that have impacted decisions regarding the character's portrayal.\n\nReacting to \"The Killing Joke\" and Barbara Gordon's later character development as Oracle in \"Batman: Gotham Knights\", Ray Tate, a reviewer at Comics Bulletin, wrote \"[t]here is absolutely no reason why Barbara Gordon should be in a wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant\" The Killing Joke\" as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker ... [Batman] himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair.\" Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts \"[i]t's ridiculous to think somebody wakes up thinking how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl.\" In an article for \"Bitch\" magazine entitled \"The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence\", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: \"Both had their backs broken [Batman broke his in a dramatic Batcave confrontation with the villain Bane; Batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the Joker, never given a chance to fight]. Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl—now named Oracle—was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.\"\n\nArtist Alex Ross and writer/producer Paul Dini made attempts to return the character to her original conception. Ross explained in an interview that he and Dini had planned to restore her mobility by placing her in a Lazarus Pit, a naturally occurring chemical pool in the DC Universe that has rejuvenating effects when a person is submerged within it. He stated that \"we pitched then-Batman editor Denny O'Neil with these drawings of that costume design. The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit, she was in a way, more compromised as a character ... Denny shot it down, because, according to him, everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character. The theory was that DC didn't have enough handicapped characters, so they weren't going to do anything with Barbara as she was. And the design went into the drawer.\" Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman introduced during \"52\", wears a variation of what would have been Gordon's new Batgirl costume designed by Ross.\n\nAlthough critical reception of Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle have been mixed among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: \"We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, gotten some letters from those who have disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle.\" Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon is not limited to the Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, \"Some stories ... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry's sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker.\"\n\nThe character went through possible restoration during \"Birds of Prey\" when she is infected with microscopic machines known as nanites by the super villain Brainiac, which attempted to repair her DNA. Marc Dipaolo, author of \"War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film\" (2011) commented that DC writers and editors would not allow her to recover completely, and that \"[t]he decision was made because there were not enough handicapped superheroes in the DC Universe to justify 'curing' one, and because it would have been odd to see Barbara Gordon escape from her wheelchair in the world of fiction when Christopher Reeve never had that opportunity.\"\n\nIn June 2011, DC announced that Barbara Gordon would be returning to the role of Batgirl in September 2011, in her own eponymous monthly comic, as part of a company-wide relaunch of all of their titles. In addition, former \"Birds of Prey\" writer Gail Simone would be writing the series. This announcement became one of the most controversial aspects of the DC Comics relaunch. Supporters of Barbara Gordon in her persona as Oracle expressed dismay over losing an iconic character for the disabled community. Journalist and blogger Jill Pantozzi, who is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, stated that \"people being disabled is part of the real world, it is essential it be part of the fictional world as well... Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini-series Oracle: The Cure. It's that type of honesty I expect more of ... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years, Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful I've seen in a long time.\" Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon's mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed. However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing \"Batgirl\" with Gordon as the title character was that \"[a]rms and legs get ripped off, and they grow back, somehow. Graves don't stay filled. But the one constant is that Barbara stays in that chair. Role model or not, that is problematic and uncomfortable, and the excuses to not cure her, in a world of purple rays and magic and super-science, are often unconvincing or wholly meta-textual. And the longer it goes on, the more it has stretched credibility. But now, everything has changed. If nearly everyone in the DCU, not just Batgirl but almost everyone, is now at a much earlier stage in their career, then my main objection no longer applies, because we are seeing Barbara at an earlier starting point.\"\n\nFormer Batman writer and editor Dennis O'Neil and Oracle co-creator John Ostrander have expressed disappointment over the change. O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, \"[W]e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals ... We didn't have anybody like Oracle, who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective in a way that didn't involve violence.\" However, he also stated that from an alternate point of view, \"Barbara Gordon's perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration.\" Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl, but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone's skills as a writer. He commented that \"[t]imes change and characters and people evolve. I changed things when I wrote characters, including changing Barbara to Oracle. Others do the same for this era ... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I'm sure her work will be wonderful.\"\n\nAt the time of her conception, Barbara Gordon's character was intended to reflect the women's liberation movement as an educated, career-oriented young woman, as well as a capable crime-fighter. Batgirl is considered to be one of the most popular characters to have emerged during the Silver Age of Comic Books. In \"The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines\" (2009), author Mike Madrid states: \"While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated superheroines, in the backdrop of the history of comic books, Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the '40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs.\" Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime-fighting, she defiantly ignores his objections. Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact that it works as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl. In an effort to conceal her identity from not only her enemies, but her father, Commissioner Gordon, Batman and Robin, she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian. In her civilian identity, she is seen with her hair \"tied up tightly in a bun. And she wears traditionally conservative—not to say dowdy—clothing. In other words, she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the day--busy doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior.\" Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology, aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist, such as the fact that \"[m]uch of her arsenal was carried in a Bat-purse attached to her utility belt[.]\"\n\nIn spite of shortcomings in her characterization during the late 1960s, \"by the early 1970s, Batgirl had matured, using her keen intellect, athletic dexterity, and burgeoning detective skills to solve petty and not-so-petty thefts\". Her color scheme from the \" Adventures of Batman\" cartoon are used as her primary outfit. However, by the end of the Bronze Age of Comic Books in the mid-1980s (and with the dark, gritty influence of Frank Miller's work on the Batman-related titles), Batgirl became less valuable to the franchise \"where there was not as much room for a librarian fighting crime in high heels\". In this environment, Barbara Gordon becomes increasingly skeptical of her effectiveness as Batgirl until she decides to give up crime-fighting permanently.\n\nRobin Anne Reid, in her 2008 book, \"Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews\" notes a lack of characterization given to Barbara Gordon by Alan Moore in \"Batman: The Killing Joke\", stating, \"Barbara Gordon was not portrayed as the intelligent and resourceful woman who assumed the Batgirl persona; she was portrayed as a cocoa-serving homemaker overly concerned with the mess her father was making cutting and pasting news clippings.\" Following the character's recreation as Oracle, she is shown having overcome her paralysis at the hands of the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime-fighting as an information broker. Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability, comic writer Devin Grayson stated that being \"[h]yper-defensive about her [paralysis], she has, if anything, over compensated. However, her very determination to remain self-reliant, though admirable and inspiring, has made her less willing than ever to accept support or aid of any kind.\"\n\nA defining characteristic of Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which differs from that of Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's \"Birds of Prey\" issue #10, \"State of War\", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated an interview that \"[s]he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, when push comes to shove, she'll drop the hammer.\" She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's \"Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds\" when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process. Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.\n\nAs part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch, The New 52, Barbara Gordon's paralysis is described as lasting only three years time. In \"Batgirl\" (volume 4), the character's age is reduced, and she is depicted as a recent college graduate, having earned a degree in forensic psychology. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage. The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not. In a September 2011 interview, Gail Simone stated, \"I'm enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life. She's younger, she doesn't know everything, she's been immersed in school and her life-plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she's nervous about that. I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions, but this really is a key time for her.\"\nIn Batgirl #45, Barbara Gordon began a romantic relationship with Luke Fox, the son of Lucius Fox and the new Batwing. Some of the character's background and previous relationships were erased. According to the artist of the new Batgirl series, Babs Tarr, Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson were never romantically involved in the New 52 continuity.\n\nFor DC's 2016 DC Rebirth launch, Barbara Gordon headlines two monthly series: \"Batgirl\" and \"Batgirl and the Birds of Prey\". \"Batgirl\", which is written by Hope Larson and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, begins with Barbara touring Asia to train with eastern fighters. \"Batgirl and the Birds of Prey\", which is written by Julie and Shawna Benson, and is illustrated by Claire Roe, reunites her with former teammates Black Canary and Huntress (Helena Bertinelli). The first arc of the series restores her prior history as \"Oracle\", as the team works to track down an imposter using the alias. In the DC Rebirth continuity, Barbara continues to operate in Burnside after training in Asia. She also shows a renewed romantic interest in Dick Grayson, but is unsuccessful due to him already being in a relationship.\n\nAccording to the character's fictional biography, Barbara Gordon trained in Judo, Kung Fu, Eskrima, Karate and Jujutsu, earning black belts prior to her tenure as Batgirl and is described as being a \"star athlete.\" Following the events of \"The Killing Joke\", Barbara Gordon continued to train in martial arts as Oracle, despite being paralyzed from the waist down. She has extensive skills with eskrima fighting sticks, small firearms, and batarangs; she customarily keeps a pair of eskrima sticks stored in the armrests of her wheelchair as a contingency. In the revised continuity of The New 52, she reflects on the fact that she has been taking self-defense training since age six in \"Batgirl\" #0 (2012).\n\nGordon is written as having a genius-level intellect and naturally possessing a photographic memory. She is described by Gail Simone as the most intelligent member of the Batman family and among all characters having operated out of Gotham City. Prior to the character's career as a vigilante, Barbara Gordon developed many technological skills, including vast knowledge of computers and electronics, expert skills as a hacker, and graduate training in library sciences. Like Batman, Barbara Gordon originally used a wide variety of computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl. These included an infrared scanner built into the cowl of her costume, various bat-inspired weaponry, and the Batcycle. According to Gail Simone, Oracle maintains control over the twelve technologically advanced satellites that were created by Lex Luthor during his tenure as President of the United States.\n\nAs Oracle, Barbara Gordon placed her considerable skills and knowledge at the disposal of many of the DC Universe's heroes. She is a skilled hacker, capable of retrieving and dispersing information from private satellites, military installations, government files, and the properties of Lex Luthor. Batman, himself a genius with a wide knowledge base and access to vast information resources, routinely consults Oracle for assistance. Writer and editor Dennis O'Neil, who first established Oracle as Batman's intellectual equal and source of information, stated that \"[i]t was logical for her to be there in Batman's world ... Batman would need someone like that.\"\n\nSince her debut in DC Comics publication, and fueled by her adaptation into the \"Batman\" television series in 1967, Barbara Gordon has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons. Author Brian Cronin, in \"Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed\" (2009) notes that following her 1967 debut, \"Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly over the next two decades and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon.\" Similarly, Cronin states that following the publication of \"The Killing Joke\", Barbara Gordon—in her new persona as Oracle—became \"more popular, in fact, than she was when she was Batgirl. She even gained her own title, Birds of Prey, about her and a group of superhero operatives she organizes[.]\" The character has been the subject of analysis in academia, regarding the portrayal of women, librarians, and disabled people in mainstream media. Throughout the course of the character's history, Barbara Gordon's intelligence has been one of her defining attributes. According to \"BusinessWeek\", she is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional superheroes appearing in American comics, and is the only female character to appear on the list. In 2011, Barbara Gordon was ranked 17th in both IGN's \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\" and \"Comics Buyer's Guide's\" \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\".\n\nIn \"The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines\" (2009), author Mike Madrid states that what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl apart from other female characters was her motivation for crime-fighting. Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, \"she wears his symbol on her chest, but she is not his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden.\" Because she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, \"Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male.\" Historian Peter Sanderson observed that while \"Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian ... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her 'civilian identity' and ran for Congress.)\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Barbara Kesel, after writing a complaint to DC Comics over the negative portrayal of female characters, was given the opportunity to write for Barbara Gordon in \"Detective Comics\". Robin Anne Reid, in \"Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews\" (2009), wrote that \"Kesel's version of Batgirl established her as a character separate from Batman and Robin: a woman motivated to do what men do, but alone and in her own way. Her \"Secret Origins\" (1987) and \"Batgirl Special\" (1988) countered the victimized and objectified presentation of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl in Alan Moore's acclaimed \"The Killing Joke\" (1988).\" She notes that Kesel's interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence, technological skill, and ability to overcome fear. Commenting on Barbara Gordon's eventual evolution into Oracle, she states \"[m]any readers and individuals within the industry believe that Barbara Gordon became a 'better' character after she was paralyzed, but few people comment on specifics of the event that allowed her to become that 'better' character.\"\n\nIn \"Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks\" (2010), author Sharon Packer wrote that \"[a]nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon's] accident is advised to consult the source material\", calling the work \"sadistic to the core.\" Brian Cronin noted that \"[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out.\" Jeffrey A. Brown, author of \"Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture\" (2011) noted \"The Killing Joke\" as an example of the \"inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry\" in light of the \"relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to.\" While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage. Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated, \"if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl, it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly.\"\n\nDespite views that present the character's Batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment, a long-held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of Batman \"rather than standing alone as leader, such as Wonder Woman\" who had no pre-existing male counterpart. In analyzing stereotypes in gender, Jackie Marsh noted that male superheroes (such as Batman) are depicted as hyper-masculine and anti-social, \"while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names\" such as the Batgirl character. Professor James B. South, chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Marquette University, stated that Barbara Gordon's character development as Oracle gave her a sense of independence she could not achieve as Batgirl. During her tenure as Batman's protege, \"she seems to develop her own style of fighting as Batgirl, [but] she's still basically following in Batman's footsteps.\" Following \"The Killing Joke\", her recreation as Oracle, and the launch of \"Birds of Prey\", \"we see Barbara Gordon as a team leader and her transformation from a girl into a woman.\"\n\nIn \"The Image and Role of the Librarian\" (2002), Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that her portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession, in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career. Even in light of the fact that the character abandons it in order to run for United States Congress, Barbara Gordon is seen as being given a \"career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up.\" In the essay \"Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality\" (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that \"[t]he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given.\" Unlike her earlier incarnation as Batgirl, \"[a]s Oracle, Barbara Gordon is arguably the first true librarian-as-super-hero yet seen in a mainstream comic book (as opposed to a super-hero who happens to be a librarian in his/her private life).\" Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel note that Oracle exerts her influence over the DC Universe primarily from home, putting \"to full use the information science skills [she] learned on her way to her PhD\" In her new persona, \"the physically challenged but superbly resourceful Oracle occupies a unique place in the annals of superhero-dom—the 'information goddess' as crime stopper.\" Using Barbara Gordon in her role as Oracle, author Sean Wise asserts her character as a model for business networking. In \"How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work\" (2008) he states that \"[o]ver the last decade, Oracle has shown the power of a strong network of contacts, and in doing so she shows Business Superheroes the importance of cultivating contacts and developing assets that can further their collective goals.\"\n\nOver the years, the American Library Association and DC Comics have collaborated on multiple projects to promote literacy. These efforts frequently involve Barbara Gordon. In 2004, artist Gene Ha created a poster and bookmark that depicted Barbara Gordon walking in a library. Her Batgirl costume appears in a window's reflection. The tagline \"Librarians are heroes every day!\" appears at the bottom of the poster and bookmark. In 2009, a poster featured Barbara Gordon as the Oracle alongside Batman, Nightwing, Robin, the Cassandra Cain version of Batgirl, and Huntress. In 2015, the ALA and DC Comics collaborated on a new set of posters and bookmarks in the ALA's \"READ\" campaign. By herself, Barbara Gordon appears in the \"Batgirl of Burnside\" guise as envisioned by Babs Tarr. In another design, she appears as the Oracle alongside other members of the extended Bat Family.\n\nFollowing the character's reinvention as the information broker Oracle, she has been regarded as a symbol of empowerment for disabled people. In \"Unleashing the Superhero in Us All\" (2008), author T. James Musler notes that \"[f]or quite sometime, any handicap was considered insurmountable\" citing Franklin D. Roosevelt as an example, who was never photographed in a wheelchair to avoid a perception of weakness. In reference to Barbara Gordon, he states \"[r]ather than quitting crime fighting, Barbara combines her intellect and computer skills to help the superhero community by gathering and passing along information.\" Her character thus signifies that \"[n]o longer is a handicap overwhelming, a person can live a strong good life, handicap or not.\" In \"The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes\" (2004), author Gina Renée Misiroglu observes that while disabled characters in comic books are typically utilized as gimmicks, or—as with Charles Xavier and Daredevil—are introduced with a pre-existing condition as part of their origin myth, \"[a]s Oracle... Gordon stands tall as the most empowering disabled superhero. Readers witnessed her tragedy, and watched her rise above it.\" James B. South's chapter \"Barbara Gordon and Moral Perfectionism\" in the 2004 book \"Superheroes and Philosophy\" analyzes how the changes in her life \"from librarian to Batgirl to Oracle\" drive her to pursue a higher self, illustrating the philosophical theory of moral perfectionism.\n\nPortrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character's first adaptation outside of comic books took place in the third season of \"Batman\" (1967). Les Daniels, in \"Batman: The Complete History\" (2004) wrote that the goal of ABC was to \"attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men.\" According to Craig: \"I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle ... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice.\" A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes portrayed later in television (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, \"her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use.\" However, Craig has also stated: \"I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model ... They say it's because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that's lovely.\" During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women. Since \"Batman\", the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in \"The Batman/Superman Hour\" (1968), Melendy Britt in \"The New Adventures of Batman\" (1977), Melissa Gilbert in \"\" (1992), Tara Strong in \"The New Batman Adventures\" (1997) and \"Beware the Batman\" (2013), Danielle Judovits in \"The Batman\" (2004), Mae Whitman in \"\" (2008) and Alyson Stoner in \"Young Justice\" (2011). \"The Batman\" series also showcased the character's first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode \"Artifacts\" (2007). She also appears in \"DC Super Hero Girls\" voiced by Mae Whitman in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as Batgirl. Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999's \"Batman Beyond\", who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of the Gotham City police department.\n\nDina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series \"Birds of Prey\" (2002). It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis at the hands of the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: \"She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs ... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she had a knack for solving mysteries. And all of a sudden she became this computer genius.\" Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot. It aired for one season before receiving cancellation. In the fourth season of the TV series \"Arrow\", after Felicity Smoak suffered a similar paralyzing injury, Oliver Queen gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that \"Oracle\" was taken. Although, in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the Teen Titans she was slated to appear in the live-action \"Titans\" series for TNT. This version of the character will be a wheelchair-bound computer expert, but will not yet be known as Oracle. This series has since been abandoned\n\nIn addition to live-action television and animation, the character has appeared in a number of video games included in the Batman franchise. She appears in \"The Adventures of Batman & Robin\", \"\", \"\" and \"\" voiced by Tara Strong. She is also in \"\" for the first time as Oracle. She also appears in \"\" for the PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PlayStation Portable. She plays a supporting role as Oracle in \"\" for the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, serving as Batman's guide through Arkham, and is voiced by Kimberly Brooks. She also appears as the radio guide alongside Alfred Pennyworth, as they both serve as Batman's guides in the sequel, \"\". A teenage Barbara also appears in the prequel \"\", voiced by Kelsey Lansdowne. In the 2008 live-action film, \"The Dark Knight\", a very young Barbara Gordon is depicted. She is credited as \"Gordon's Daughter\", while the name \"Barbara Gordon\" is reserved for Commissioner Gordon's wife. She also acts as the primary contact for hero characters as Oracle in \"DC Universe Online\", voiced by Katherine Catmull for the PC and the PlayStation 3. She assists the player through the tutorial and will offer comments and advice throughout the game including a guided tour of the JLA Watchtower. She is a playable character in \"\", with Kimberly Brooks reprising her role. Barbara has returned in \"\" where she is voiced by Ashley Greene. In addition, Barbara also appears as a playable character as part of the game's season pass.\n\nBarbara Gordon appears in the 2017 animated film \"The Lego Batman Movie\" voiced by Rosario Dawson. She is introduced taking over from her father Jim Gordon to become the new Police Commissioner of Gotham. This allows for the continuation of still having a 'Commissioner Gordon' and gives a more prominent role to the character. She later dons her cowl and teams up with Batman as Batgirl in addition to her role as Commissioner. In March 2017, it was announced that Joss Whedon was in talks to write, direct and produce a Batgirl film as part of the DC Extended Universe. The film would center on Barbara Gordon, with The New 52 comics by Gail Simone serving as \"a starting point\" for the film. Whedon was to begin production on the film in 2018, but stepped down in February 2018. In April 2018, after impressing the studio with her work on \"Birds of Prey\", Hodson was hired as screenwriter for \"Batgirl\" as well. The studio is actively looking for a female director.\n\n\n"}

He co-piloted the United States Army Air Forces B-29 bomber known as the \"Bockscar\" during the mission which dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. The bombing of Nagasaki killed an estimated 40,000 people instantly, and led to Japan's unconditional surrender on August 14, 1945, ending World War II.\n\nAlbury was born in 1920 at his parents' home in Miami, Florida. The Miami Police Department building currently stands on the site of Albury's birthplace, as of 2009.\n\nAlbury enrolled at the University of Miami's engineering school, but dropped out before he completed his bachelor's degree in order to enlist in the United States Army during World War II. He was one of three pilots assigned under the command of Captain Charles Sweeney to test the XB-29 and YB-29 delivered to Eglin Air Force Base in September 1943. Albury joined (now Major) Sweeny at Wendover Air Force Base in Utah where he and Sweeney were invited by Colonel Paul Tibbets to join what would become the nucleus of the 509th Composite Group in September 1944. (The 509th Composite Group was activated December 17, 1944.) Tibbets initially organized two air crews: one headed by himself with Robert A. Lewis as co-pilot (cockpit crew of the Enola Gay during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima), the other headed by Sweeney with Albury as the co-pilot. Roberts and Albury acted as pilots and crew commanders for their respective planes when Tibbets and/or Sweeney were not flying.\n\nOn August 6, 1945, Albury witnessed the first atomic bombing of Hiroshima as pilot of the instrument observation plane, The Great Artiste, which accompanied the Enola Gay commanded by Tibbets. Albury measured the levels of radioactivity and magnitude of the atomic bomb from his plane. He would later state in an interview with Time Magazine, \"When Tibbets dropped the bomb, we dropped our instruments and made our left turn. Then this bright light hit us and the top of that mushroom cloud was the most terrifying, but also the most beautiful, thing you've ever seen in your life. Every color in the rainbow seemed to be coming out of it.\"\n\nOn August 9, 1945, just three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, Sweeney's crew, with Albury as co-pilot, took off in the B-29 Superfortress, nicknamed the Bockscar, which would drop the atomic bomb known as the \"Fat Man\" on the city of Nagasaki. The attack was delayed by cloud cover until the crew located a hole in the clouds. The Bockscar dropped the 10,200-pound \"Fat Man\" on the city of Nagasaki, instantly killing 40,000 people, the vast majority of them munitions workers. An additional 35,000 Japanese citizens would succumb from radiation sickness and other injuries in the aftermath of the bombing.\n\nImmediately after the formal surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, Albury flew with Tibbetts, Sweeney and close to twenty other members of their aircrews to Japan. The group eventually reached Nagasaki and witnessed on the ground the destruction caused by the atomic bomb.\n\nAlbury stated repeatedly during his life that he did not have any remorse for the attack or his role in the attack on Nagasaki, noting that many more lives would have been lost if the United States had launched a full invasion of mainland Japan.\n\nAt the end of the second world war, Albury moved to Coral Gables, Florida with his wife, Roberta. He chose a career as a commercial airline pilot for the now defunct Eastern Airlines. He later became the co-manager of Eastern's Airbus A300 training program. He later moved to a house in Hunter's Creek (south Orlando) where he lived until his death.\n\nCharles Donald Albury died on May 23, 2009, at a hospital in Orlando, Florida, at the age of 88. He had suffered from congestive heart failure for several years before his death. He appeared in the Smithsonian Networks program \"Smithsonian Channel's War Stories\", \"The Men Who Brought the Dawn\", in 1995, giving his recollections and reflections on the two atomic bomb missions.\n"}

Evans was loaned to Norwich City in 2007, where he scored 10 goals in 28 league appearances, before returning to his parent club. With first team opportunities at City limited he was subsequently sold to Sheffield United for £3 million in 2009. After an unspectacular first two seasons at Bramall Lane he scored 35 goals during the 2011–12 season. He also represented Wales at Wales under-21 and senior level, scoring on his debut for the national side in 2008, and making a total of 13 appearances.\n\nEvans was convicted of rape in April 2012 and spent two and a half years in prison. His conviction was quashed on 21 April 2016 by the Court of Appeal, and a retrial was ordered. On 14 October 2016, he was found not guilty. Prior to the retrial, he joined Chesterfield.\n\nEvans began his playing career in Rhyl, before spending two seasons in Chester City's youth set-up from where he moved to Manchester City in 2002 following the closure of Chester's youth team. During the 2006–07 season, Evans was a regular in the Academy and reserve teams and was also in the side that reached the final of the 2006 FA Youth Cup, where City lost to Liverpool. In May 2007, Evans signed his first professional contract with Manchester City.\nIn September 2007 Evans came off the bench to make his senior debut in City's 1–0 League Cup victory against Norwich City. With first choice opportunities at City limited Evans moved on loan to Norwich City in November of that year, agreeing a deal until 1 January 2008. He made his debut for Norwich the following week when he came on as a substitute in the 3–1 victory over Blackpool. His first goal for the club came two games later, and just two minutes into his first start in a 2–1 victory over Plymouth Argyle at the start of December. Evans returned to Manchester City after his initial loan deal expired in January 2008, having made eight appearances and scored two goals.\n\nInitially, Norwich manager Glenn Roeder's attempts to extend the loan were refused, however, on 10 January, the two clubs agreed a deal to allow Evans to return to Norwich on loan until 26 February, with Manchester City able to recall him after an initial period. However, after talks between the two clubs at the end of January 2008, the deal was extended to allow Evans to stay with the Carrow Road club until the end of the season. Then Manchester City manager Sven-Göran Eriksson stated he had no plans to sell Evans and that he would not be leaving the summer transfer window. Evans played regularly for Norwich for the remainder of his loan spell and by the end of the season he had notched up 10 goals from 20 starts and eight substitute appearances.\n\nEvans made his Premier League debut for Manchester City in the opening game of the following season on 18 August, against Aston Villa. He was not chosen for the starting eleven but replaced Valeri Bojinov, who suffered an injury during the pre-game warm-up. Evans scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester City against Portsmouth on 21 September, scoring the fifth goal as City went on to win 6–0. With City's acquisition of Craig Bellamy and later Emmanuel Adebayor, Roque Santa Cruz and Carlos Tevez, Evans opted to leave in 2009 in order to get more first team football.\n\nEvans joined Sheffield United for an initial fee of £3 million plus possible future add-ons on a three-year deal in July 2009, making his debut for United in the first game of the new season; a 0–0 draw with Middlesbrough. Having bagged a brace for the Wales U21s during the midweek fixtures he then scored his first goal in Blades colours on his home debut, a 2–0 win over Watford. Despite a promising start Evans struggled to maintain any real form and was often relegated to the role of substitute during his first season with the Blades, making 36 appearances but scoring only four goals. The following season Evans was a regular first team choice and his form and scoring rate began to improve, despite the club going through a season of turmoil and battling against relegation. He finished the campaign as top scorer with nine goals in all competitions, but was unable to prevent the team dropping out of the division.\n\nWith the Blades now in League One there was speculation that Evans would be sold to ease the club's wage bill but an injury picked up in the last days of the previous campaign meant he was unavailable until early September, preventing him from moving on to another club. Having returned from injury Evans hit a rich vein of form scoring regularly in both league and cup competitions as the Blades contested for promotion. On 28 March 2012 he scored a second-half hat trick within 15 minutes against Chesterfield giving him his thirtieth goal of the season in a 4–1 win for Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. During this impressive third season, Evans drew attention from Championship and Premier League clubs with his contract scheduled to expire in the summer. However, Blades manager Danny Wilson stated that Evans \"[wasn't] even thinking about leaving Bramall Lane\", adding \"Of course we don't want to lose Ched.\" Evans was named League One Player of the Month for March 2012, having scored 10 goals in 8 games. He was nominated for 'League One Player of the Season', and in April 2012 Evans was named in the League One PFA Team of the Year. He ended the season with 35 goals in all competitions, but following his rape conviction Evans was released by United at the end of the season.\nOn 20 June 2016, Evans signed his first contract since his release from prison and the quashing of his conviction, signing for one year at Chesterfield in League One. He was signed by his former Sheffield United manager Wilson, and their first-team coach was his former Blades teammate Chris Morgan.\n\nHe scored on his debut for Chesterfield on 23 July, his first game in nearly four years, in a 3–0 pre-season friendly win over Ilkeston. He also scored, with a free-kick from , on his return to professional football, in a 1–1 away draw with Oxford United, on 6 August 2016. In his home debut for Chesterfield, on 13 August 2016 against Swindon Town, Evans produced a match-winning performance, scoring Chesterfield's third goal and having a hand in the other two from Gary Liddle and Jay O'Shea as they won 3–1.\n\nOn 8 May 2017, Evans was signed by former club Sheffield United, having had several talks with Chris Wilder.\n\nIn July 2018, Evans signed a season-long loan deal with Fleetwood Town. He scored his first goal for Fleetwood on 11 August in 2-0 away win against Oxford United. It was his first goal since 2016 when he was playing for Chesterfield. Following his debut goal, Evans left the pitch to a standing ovation from Fleetwood fans.\n\nEvans gained his first Wales U21 cap in 2007. He became a regular member of the squad and in November 2007 he scored a hat-trick against France U21s. In doing so he became only the fourth player to have scored a hat-trick for the under-21 side, along with John Hartson, Craig Davies and Lee Jones. Evans scored a brace against Bosnia and Herzegovina U21s in October 2009, taking his tally for the Welsh U21s to 13 goals in 12 games.\n\nEvans made his senior debut for Wales on 28 May 2008, scoring the winning goal (with a back heel) in a 1–0 away friendly victory against Iceland. He made 13 appearances for Wales in total, scoring once.\n\nOn 28 March 2012, Stuart Pearce, the Great Britain Olympic football team manager, was present at the match against Chesterfield, in which Evans scored a hat-trick, taking his season tally to 30, in a 4–1 win at Bramall Lane. Evans commented on the possibility of representing Team GB at the London 2012 Summer Olympics: \"If I was asked then it's something I'd definitely look at doing. I don't know whether I even will be though... But if the chance was there then, like anyone else, I'd certainly have to think about it.\"\n\nEvans was born in Rhyl, Clwyd. \n\nAfter signing for Sheffield United, Evans moved to Millhouse Green, Penistone, in the nearby Barnsley area. After the death of former Wales boss and Sheffield United player, coach and manager Gary Speed, Evans revealed a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal in the FA Cup win over Torquay United, which read \"Rest in peace Speedo\".\n\nSince 2009, Evans has been dating Natasha Massey. Massey's father, Karl, a businessman, funded a website, \"Chedevans.com\", which proclaimed Evans to be \"wrongly convicted of rape on 20th April 2012\". He also hired lawyers for an appeal. Evans and Massey have a son, born in January 2016.\n\nEvans and another footballer, Clayton McDonald, were tried at the Crown Court at Caernarfon after being indicted of the rape of a 19-year-old woman, who was alleged to be too drunk to consent, at a hotel near Rhyl in May 2011. Evans was convicted on 20 April 2012 and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. He was eligible for release on licence after serving half of that sentence. During his imprisonment Evans worked as a painter and decorator in prison. In August 2012, Evans was refused leave to appeal against the conviction by a single Court of Appeal of England and Wales judge and the full court upheld the decision in November. Evans continued to maintain his innocence and in November 2013 recruited a new legal team to attempt to clear his name.\n\nAfter serving half of his prison sentence, Evans was eligible for release, and was released on licence on 17 October 2014. Following his release, the Criminal Cases Review Commission announced that they were reviewing his conviction. In January 2015, it was reported that Evans had submitted fresh evidence to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, to attempt to strengthen his case. In October 2015, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, following a 10-month investigation, and relying on \"new material which was not considered by the jury at trial\", referred the case to the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 22 March 2016, the case was heard by the Court of Appeal, which imposed a ban on reporting details of the legal argument. On 21 April 2016, the appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. A retrial was ordered. This began on 4 October 2016 and on 14 October Evans was found not guilty.\n\nIn April 2014, Sheffield United Co-Chairman Kevin McCabe and new manager Nigel Clough met with Evans in HM Prison Wymott to discuss the possibility of Sheffield United re-signing Evans after his release from prison. Following speculation that Evans could rejoin his former club, a petition was signed by 150,000 people urging the club not to do so, which stated that it would be a \"deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist\".\n\nIn November 2014, following his release from prison, it was announced that Evans would resume training with Sheffield United after the Professional Footballers' Association had requested that Sheffield United let Evans train at the club as they were his last club before his conviction. The decision was controversial, and caused television presenter Charlie Webster, businesswoman Lindsay Graham and musicians Dave Berry and Paul Heaton to resign as patrons of the club. Athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill stated that she would want her name removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Evans was signed by the club.\n\nThe Football League stated that although they recognised the gravity of Evans' crime, they valued the reintegration of reformed criminals and could not take any action against any club which would hire Evans. Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough said on 12 November that the club were \"no where near\" signing Evans, citing his 30 months out of the professional game and an important run of fixtures as reasons why a decision would not be taken immediately. DBL Logistics, Sheffield United's sponsor on the back of their shirts, stated that they would end their sponsorship if Evans was signed by the club. John Holland Sales, who sponsor on the front of the shirts, declared that they would \"re-evaluate\" their relation to the club if he were signed. On 20 November, Sheffield United withdrew their offer to allow Evans to use their training facilities. Co-chairman Jim Phipps, however, attributed the decision to \"mob-like behaviour\", stating his belief that Evans had a right to return to his career having served his sentence.\n\nIn December 2014, Hartlepool United manager Ronnie Moore said that he would like Evans to join the club. The comment brought criticism from Hartlepool's MP, Iain Wright, who described Evans as a \"pariah\". The club later followed up this headline with a statement saying that Hartlepool does not wish to sign Evans.\n\nOn 2 January 2015, Hibernians of the Maltese Premier League, through their English vice-president Stephen Vaughan, announced that they had offered Evans a contract up to the end of the season. The British Ministry of Justice said that such a move would not be possible as Evans was a convicted sex offender on licence and, as such, barred from working abroad. Malta's Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, warned Hibernians that hiring Evans could affect the whole country's reputation, while Justice Minister Owen Bonnici stated that Evans had a right to return to his profession after being released from prison.\n\nOn 4 January 2015, it was reported that Evans had been in discussion with League One club Oldham Athletic and was expected to sign for them in a deal which may be worth as little as £400 per week. The club's manager Lee Johnson was reported to have expressed \"grave reservations\" about the signing, but was overruled by the club's owner Simon Corney. A petition against the signing gathered 19,000 signatures within a few hours and over 30,000 by the next day, while politicians such as Labour Party leader Ed Miliband voiced their opposition to the move.\n\nOn 8 January 2015, Oldham Athletic ended their interest in signing Evans, citing that proceeding could have resulted in \"significant financial pressure\" and would have \"continued to be a divisive influence\", while condemning the \"vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff\". BBC Sport reported that a named relative of a staff member was threatened with rape, and that one sponsor already having ended their association with Oldham in protest and another saying that it would follow suit if Evans signed. The petition against Evans signing had reached over 60,000 signatures. Meanwhile, a total of ten other clubs (other than Oldham and Sheffield United) from League One and League Two told BBC Sport that they would not sign Evans.\n\nEvans stated that he withdrew from the deal due to \"mob rule\", and that he was concerned the building of Oldham's new stand would be adversely affected by his signing. He also apologised for any grievances he had caused due to his rape case, but maintained his innocence. Journalist Henry Winter, writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", refuted Evans' claims, instead saying that \"it was people's disgust that a convicted rapist felt he could swan back into a high-profile job after revealing no remorse for a crime that would preclude re-employment for many\", while criticising Evans for making \"his statement of contrition ... on the offensive, legally questionable website that continues to make life miserable for his victim\".\n\nOn 8 January 2015, it was announced by Grimsby Town director John Fenty that a financial backer had offered the club to pay his full wages in order to bring Evans to the Conference Premier club. Having held a board meeting along with team manager Paul Hurst it was decided that the move would be of too high risk for the club. Grimsby had previously employed Clayton McDonald, the fellow footballer and friend of Evans who was acquitted in the same case, during the 2013–14 season.\n\n\nIndividual\n\n"}
{"id": "5693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5693", "title": "Claude Shannon", "text": "Claude Shannon\n\nClaude Elwood Shannon (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer known as \"the father of information theory\".\n\nShannon is noted for having founded information theory with a landmark paper, \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\", that he published in 1948. He is, perhaps, equally well known for founding digital circuit design theory in 1937, when—as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)—he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship. Shannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense during World War II, including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications.\n\nShannon was born in Petoskey, Michigan and grew up in Gaylord, Michigan. His father, Claude, Sr. (1862–1934), a descendant of early settlers of New Jersey, was a self-made businessman, and for a while, a Judge of Probate. Shannon's mother, Mabel Wolf Shannon (1890–1945), was a language teacher, and also served as the principal of Gaylord High School.\n\nMost of the first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from Gaylord High School in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics. At home he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio-controlled model boat and a barbed-wire telegraph system to a friend's house a half-mile away. While growing up, he also worked as a messenger for the Western Union company.\n\nHis childhood hero was Thomas Edison, who he later learned was a distant cousin. Both Shannon and Edison were descendants of John Ogden (1609–1682), a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.\n\nShannon was apolitical and an atheist.\n\nIn 1932, Shannon entered the University of Michigan, where he was introduced to the work of George Boole. He graduated in 1936 with two bachelor's degrees: one in electrical engineering and the other in mathematics.\n\nIn 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at MIT, where he worked on Vannevar Bush's differential analyzer, an early analog computer. While studying the complicated \"ad hoc\" circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed switching circuits based on Boole's concepts. In 1937, he wrote his master's degree thesis, \"A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits\". A paper from this thesis was published in 1938. In this work, Shannon proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays that were used then in telephone call routing switches. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve. In the last chapter, he presented diagrams of several circuits, including a 4-bit full adder.\n\nUsing this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Shannon's work became the foundation of digital circuit design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after World War II. The theoretical rigor of Shannon's work superseded the \"ad hoc\" methods that had prevailed previously. Howard Gardner called Shannon's thesis \"possibly the most important, and also the most noted, master's thesis of the century.\"\n\nShannon received his Ph.D. degree from MIT in 1940. Vannevar Bush had suggested that Shannon should work on his dissertation at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, in order to develop a mathematical formulation for Mendelian genetics. This research resulted in Shannon's PhD thesis, called \"An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics.\"\n\nIn 1940, Shannon became a National Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and John von Neumann, and he also had occasional encounters with Albert Einstein and Kurt Gödel. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical information theory.\n\nShannon then joined Bell Labs to work on fire-control systems and cryptography during World War II, under a contract with section D-2 (Control Systems section) of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC).\n\nShannon is credited with the invention of signal-flow graphs, in 1942. He discovered the topological gain formula while investigating the functional operation of an analog computer.\n\nFor two months early in 1943, Shannon came into contact with the leading British mathematician Alan Turing. Turing had been posted to Washington to share with the U.S. Navy's cryptanalytic service the methods used by the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park to break the ciphers used by the Kriegsmarine U-boats in the north Atlantic Ocean. He was also interested in the encipherment of speech and to this end spent time at Bell Labs. Shannon and Turing met at teatime in the cafeteria. Turing showed Shannon his 1936 paper that defined what is now known as the \"Universal Turing machine\"; This impressed Shannon, as many of its ideas complemented his own.\n\nIn 1945, as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control, a special essay titled \"Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems\", coauthored by Shannon, Ralph Beebe Blackman, and Hendrik Wade Bode, formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with \"the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems.\" In other words, it modeled the problem in terms of data and signal processing and thus heralded the coming of the Information Age.\n\nShannon's work on cryptography was even more closely related to his later publications on communication theory. At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for Bell Telephone Labs entitled \"A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography,\" dated September 1945. A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\" in the \"Bell System Technical Journal\". This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\". Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously and that \"they were so close together you couldn’t separate them\". In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to \"develop these results … in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information.\"\n\nWhile he was at Bell Labs, Shannon proved that the cryptographic one-time pad is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published in October 1949. He also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and be kept secret.\n\nIn 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication,\" an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the \"Bell System Technical Journal\". This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the information a sender wants to transmit. In this fundamental work, he used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener, which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure of the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory. In 1949 Claude Shannon and Robert Fano devised a systematic way to assign code words based on probabilities of blocks. This technique, known as Shannon-Fano coding, was first proposed in the 1948 article.\n\nThe book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, \"The Mathematical Theory of Communication\", reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver pointed out that the word \"information\" in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's \"Symbols, Signals, and Noise\".\n\nInformation theory's fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics was further established in 1951, in his article \"Prediction and Entropy of Printed English\", showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English – giving a statistical foundation to language analysis. In addition, he proved that treating whitespace as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.\n\nAnother notable paper published in 1949 is \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\", a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography, in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of sampling theory, which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.\n\nHe returned to MIT to hold an endowed chair in 1956.\n\nIn 1956 Shannon joined the MIT faculty to work in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE). He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978.\n\nShannon developed Alzheimer's disease and spent the last few years of his life in a nursing home in Massachusetts oblivious to the marvels of the digital revolution he had helped create. He died in 2001. He was survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Moore Shannon, his son, Andrew Moore Shannon, his daughter, Margarita Shannon, his sister, Catherine Shannon Kay, and his two granddaughters. His wife stated in his obituary that, had it not been for Alzheimer's disease, \"He would have been bemused\" by it all.\n\nOutside of Shannon's academic pursuits, he was interested in juggling, unicycling, and chess. He also invented many devices, including a Roman numeral computer called THROBAC, juggling machines, and a flame-throwing trumpet. One of his more humorous devices was a box kept on his desk called the \"Ultimate Machine\", based on an idea by Marvin Minsky. Otherwise featureless, the box possessed a single switch on its side. When the switch was flipped, the lid of the box opened and a mechanical hand reached out, flipped off the switch, then retracted back inside the box (similar to : Qiyun Stealing Coin Cat Piggy Bank). In addition, he built a device that could solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle.\n\nShannon designed the Minivac 601, a digital computer trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned. It was sold by the Scientific Development Corp starting in 1961.\n\nHe is also considered the co-inventor of the first wearable computer along with Edward O. Thorp. The device was used to improve the odds when playing roulette.\n\nShannon married Norma Levor, a wealthy, Jewish, left-wing intellectual in January 1940. The marriage ended in divorce after about a year. Levor later married Ben Barzman.\n\nShannon met his second wife Betty Shannon (née Mary Elizabeth Moore) when she was a numerical analyst at Bell Labs. They were married in 1949. Betty assisted Claude in building some of his most famous inventions.\n\nClaude and Betty Shannon had three children, Robert James Shannon, Andrew Moore Shannon, and Margarita Shannon, and raised his family in Winchester, Massachusetts. Their oldest son, Robert Shannon, died in 1998 at the age of 45.\n\nAfter suffering from a progressive decline over some years due to Alzheimer's disease, Shannon died at the age of 85, on February 24, 2001. \n\nTo commemorate Shannon's achievements, there were celebrations of his work in 2001.\n\nThere are currently six statues of Shannon sculpted by Eugene Daub: one at the University of Michigan; one at MIT in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems; one in Gaylord, Michigan; one at the University of California, San Diego; one at Bell Labs; and another at AT&T Shannon Labs. After the breakup of the Bell System, the part of Bell Labs that remained with AT&T Corporation was named Shannon Labs in his honor.\n\nAccording to Neil Sloane, an AT&T Fellow who co-edited Shannon's large collection of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon's communication theory (now called information theory) is the foundation of the digital revolution, and every device containing a microprocessor or microcontroller is a conceptual descendant of Shannon's publication in 1948: \"He's one of the great men of the century. Without him, none of the things we know today would exist. The whole digital revolution started with him.\" The unit shannon is named after Claude Shannon.\n\n\"A Mind at Play\", a biography of Shannon written by Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman, was published in 2017.\n\nOn April 30, 2016 Shannon was honored with a Google Doodle to celebrate his life on what would have been his 100th birthday.\n\n\"Theseus\", created in 1950, was a magnetic mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it to move around a labyrinth of 25 squares. Its dimensions were the same as those of an average mouse. The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions. The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior. Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.\n\nIn 1949 Shannon completed a paper (published in March 1950) which estimates the game-tree complexity of chess, which is approximately 10. This number is now often referred to as the \"Shannon number\", and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the game's complexity. The number is often cited as one of the barriers to solving the game of chess using an exhaustive analysis (i.e. brute force analysis).\n\nOn March 9, 1949, Shannon presented a paper called \"Programming a Computer for playing Chess.\" The paper was presented at the National Institute for Radio Engineers Convention in New York. He described how to program a computer to play chess based on position scoring and move selection. He proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess. In March 1950 it was published in Philosophical Magazine, and is considered one of the first articles published on the topic of programming a computer for playing chess, and using a computer to solve the game. His process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a minimax procedure, based on an evaluation function of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. \"Material\" was counted according to the usual chess piece relative value (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen). He considered some positional factors, subtracting ½ point for each doubled pawn, backward pawn, and isolated pawn. Another positional factor in the evaluation function was \"mobility\", adding 0.1 point for each legal move available. Finally, he considered checkmate to be the capture of the king, and gave the king the artificial value of 200 points. Quoting from the paper:\n\nThe evaluation function was clearly for illustrative purposes, as Shannon stated. For example, according to the function, pawns that are doubled as well as isolated would have no value at all, which is clearly unrealistic.\n\nShannon formulated a version of Kerckhoffs' principle as \"The enemy knows the system\". In this form it is known as \"Shannon's maxim\".\n\nThe Shannon Centenary, 2016, marked the life and influence of Claude Elwood Shannon on the hundredth anniversary of his birth on April 30, 1916. It was inspired in part by the Alan Turing Year. An ad hoc committee of the IEEE Information Theory Society including Christina Fragouli, Rüdiger Urbanke, Michelle Effros, Lav Varshney and Sergio Verdú, coordinated worldwide events. The initiative was announced in the History Panel at the 2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop Jerusalem and the IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter.\n\nA detailed listing of confirmed events was available on the website of the IEEE Information Theory Society.\n\nSome of the planned activities included:\n\nThe Claude E. Shannon Award was established in his honor; he was also its first recipient, in 1972.\n\n\n\n"}

After an accident in his teens, in which he sustained a detached retina, he lost the sight in his left eye. He underwent an operation in about 1943 to restore some sight in this eye, but the operation was unsuccessful. The eyesight in his right eye began to seriously deteriorate in the 50s and an operation for cataracts was unsuccessful, leaving him totally blind by age 45.\n\nIn 1961 his autobiography \"This House Had Windows\" was published and in which he explained he learned braille, which took him three weeks to learn the system. The 'David Scott Blackhall Award for Services to the Blind' was named in his honour by the BBC radio's \"In Touch\" programme, a programme which Blackhall first hosted. Another award started in Blackhall's memory was the Patients' Aid Association's David Scott Blackhall Memorial Award which would award a cash prize to individuals making a positive impact to the blind community. Another blind colleague of Blackhall's at Radio 4 was Jill Allen-King. Blackhall was also a member of Rotary International since 1935 and, in 1942, founded the Rotary Club of Elstree & Borehamwood.\n\nIn 1969 during one of his radio editions of \"In Touch\", he commented on a group of blind people who had climbed Mt Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, and went on to say that Britain's highest mountain was Ben Nevis - if anyone was interested. It seemed they were, as he had a flood of letters from interested listeners who wished to make that climb. With the help of local people in the town of Fort William, a weekend was arranged at the Milton Hotel - appropriately Milton was a blind poet - and a group of 15 visually impaired men and women with local sighted companions and Blackhall at the helm, made the climb, arriving at the summit to the sound of the bagpipes, played by one of the group. It was a proud moment for him and the start of the Milton Mountaineers, who went on to meet annually to climb more of Britain's and Ireland's highest peaks. One of Blackhall's poems, \"Prayer\", is still recited by the leader of the Mountaineers at each summit. Other works of Blackhall's were \"Dark Is A Long Way\", a radio play about his Blind experiences that was broadcast in Britain in September 1958. Blackhall hosted \"In Touch\" until a week before his death, on September 14, 1981, aged 71. He had three daughters: Anne (b. 1936), (Leader of the Milton Mountaineers from 1992 to 2005); Jane (b. 1940) and Susan (b. 1949) and was married to Edna (née Westwood).\n"}

His death became the catalyst for the passage of Republic Act 9163 or the \"National Service Training Program Law\", which removed completion of mandatory ROTC as a precondition for graduation for male college students in the Philippines.\n\nChua took his elementary and high school education at Saint Jude Catholic School and his college education at the University of Santo Tomas. As a member of the ROTC unit's intelligence monitoring team, he had first-hand knowledge of corruption within the organization, which he and another student, Romulo Yumol, divulged to UST's official student publication \"The Varsitarian\" in January 2001. This resulted in the relief of then-commandant Major Demy Tejares and his staff.\n\nChua received death threats after his revelations. The new ROTC commandant advised him to undergo security training at Fort Bonifacio. On 15 March 2001, he was supposed to meet with an agent but he was never seen alive again. Three days later his decomposing body, wrapped in a carpet, was found floating in the Pasig River near the Jones Bridge. His hands and feet were tied and his face wrapped in cloth and packing tape. The autopsy report showed that sludge was in his lungs, indicating that he was alive when he was thrown into the river. In order to mislead investigators, his abductors had pretended to demand ransom from the Chua family.\n\nOn 31 March 2004, Arnulfo Aparri, Jr., one of the four suspects in the killing of Chua, was sentenced to die by lethal injection, and was ordered to pay Php 50,000.00 to the victim's family as indemnity. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment without parole after the death penalty was abolished in 2006. Another of the accused, Eduardo Tabrilla, pleaded guilty to homicide and was sentenced to 6-14 years of imprisonment in 2006. The whereabouts of the two other suspects, Paul Joseph Tan and Michael Von Rainard Manangbao remain uncertain.\n\n"}

He was the Member of Parliament for Falkirk West from 1974 to 2000 (known as West Stirlingshire from 1974 to 1983), first as a member of the Labour Party, and then as an Independent. He then served as an Independent Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Falkirk West from 1999 to 2007.\n\nIn 2014, he was the chair of the Advisory Board of Yes Scotland, the campaign for a \"Yes\" vote in the Scottish independence referendum, 2014.\n\nBorn in Cowdenbeath, Canavan was educated at St. Bride's and St. Columba's Schools, Cowdenbeath, St Andrew's College, Drygrange, and at the University of Edinburgh. He worked as a schoolteacher from 1968 until 1974 and was Assistant Head of Holy Rood High School Edinburgh at the time of his first election to Parliament. Canavan was also head of the maths department at St Modans High in Stirling.\n\nHe was leader of the Labour Party Group on Stirling District Council in 1974 and, in October of that year, was elected as Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for West Stirlingshire. Following boundary changes, he was MP for Falkirk West from 1983 to 2000. He was Chair of the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Group, 1980 – 1981. In 1975, he tried introducing a bill to abolish corporal punishment in schools and his efforts formed part of the case presented to the European Commission of Human Rights which led eventually to abolition. He voted against the Blair Government's proposals to cut benefits for children of lone parents, abolish Student Grants and introduce tuition fees.\n\nA keen sports enthusiast, he was founder and Convener of the Scottish Sports Group at Westminster and the Cross-Party Sports Group in the Scottish Parliament. He has completed a marathon in less than 3 hours and the Ben Nevis Race in just over 2 hours. He won a gold medal, playing for Scotland in the British Universities Football Championships in 1967. In his book, \"The Final Whistle?\", Harry Reid claims that he took part in the 1977 Wembley pitch invasion after Scotland beat England and ripped up a patch of the turf (see ).\n\nHe takes an active interest in international affairs and served as a member of the House of Commons Select Committees on Foreign Affairs and International Development. He is still a member of CND and Amnesty International and is interested in conflict resolution.\n\nHe chaired the Northern Ireland Committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party from 1989 to 1997, and led several Parliamentary delegations to Ireland during The Troubles. He served on the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body from 1992 to 2000. As a member of the European and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament, he was author of a report on the potential for co-operation between Scotland and Ireland. He has frequently spoken out against sectarianism and racism.\n\nThroughout his entire political life, Canavan played a leading part in the campaign for a Scottish Parliament. When Labour was in opposition, he led a nationwide consultation about devolution, on behalf of the Scottish Group of Labour MPs, leading to the publication of a bill to establish a Scottish Parliament with revenue-raising powers. However, in 1999, when the first elections to the Scottish Parliament were held, the New Labour leadership rejected him as an official Labour candidate, despite the fact that he had the support of 97% of local party members. He therefore stood as an Independent, and was consequently expelled from the party. He won with almost 55 percent of the vote, the highest majority of any MSP in the 1999 election. He resigned his Westminster seat in 2000 to concentrate on representing his constituents in the Scottish Parliament. Canavan retained his Holyrood seat in 2003 with 55.7 percent of the vote, again with the biggest majority in Scotland.\n\nIn the Scottish Parliament, he was a member of the European and External Relations Committee and Convener of the All-Party Sports Group from 1999. \nIn 2003 he criticised the Scottish football authorities when Falkirk Football Club was refused promotion to the Scottish Premier League, despite having won the First Division Championship. He supported Falkirk's efforts to build a new stadium for community use and he still regularly attends the club's matches. He is also Honorary President of Milton Amateurs Football Club.\n\nCanavan enjoys hill-walking and, in the Scottish Parliament, he championed the people's right of access to the countryside, successfully introducing amendments to the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to extend the right of access to country estates, including land belonging to the Queen. He is now President of Ramblers Scotland.\n\nHe is a strong supporter of the idea of a national holiday to celebrate St Andrew's Day, and his bill to achieve this was eventually passed as the St. Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007.\n\nWhen he announced his retirement before the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections, he was the longest serving parliamentarian in the Scottish Parliament, having completed a combined 33 years at Westminster and Holyrood. After this announcement he received an ovation in the Chamber of the Scottish Parliament from other MSPs and was praised by the First Minister Jack McConnell as \"an outstanding parliamentarian over a long, long period of time\".\n\nIn April 2010, Canavan declared his support for John McNally, the Scottish National Party candidate for Falkirk in the 2010 general election. Falkirk is the successor to Canavan's former Westminster constituency.\n\nHe has honorary doctorates from the Universities of Stirling and Strathclyde.\n\nIn recognition of his public service, Falkirk Council launched the Dennis Canavan Scholarship to encourage young people to go on to further or higher education and to use their talents to help others.\n\nHis autobiography, \"Let the People Decide\", was published by Birlinn in September 2009.

{"id": "16250676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16250676", "title": "Emiratis", "text": "Emiratis\n\nThe Emiratis or Emirati people () are the citizens of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Their largest concentration is in the UAE, where there are 1.5 or approximately \n2 million Emiratis.\n\nFormerly known as the Trucial States or Trucial Oman, the UAE is made up of seven emirates, each of which had a dominant or ruling family or tribe. Abu Dhabi was home to the Bani Yas tribal confederation; Dubai settled in 1833 by an offshoot of the Bani Yas, the Al Bu Falasah; Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah to the Al Qasimi or Qawasim; Ajman to the Al Na'im and Fujeirah to the Sharqiyin. Additionally, a number of large tribes settled in these territories or travelled the interior of the UAE, including the Manasir, Al Ali, Awamir, Mazari, Bani Qitab, Al Bu Shamis, Manahil, Rashid, Al Murrah, Zaab, Tanaij, Naqbiyin, Ghafalah and the Bani Kaab. A large number of them are from other Arab countries too and some have South Asian blood and Sub-Saharan African blood in them.\n\nEmirati culture is based on Arab culture and has been influenced by the religion Islam. Arabian influence on Emirati culture is noticeably visible in traditional Emirati architecture. Ever since the 20th century, the country has become more cosmopolitan and aspects of Western culture are very visible here.\n\nThe influence of Islamic culture on Emirati architecture, music, attire, cuisine and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to the prayer from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country.\n\nSome oriental educationists and cultural academics have stated that luxuriousness and some extravagance is a feature of the Emirati culture.\n\nEmirati music varies to each area although most are on folklore's, some cultural dances are the horbya which well known all over the United Arab Emirates, The Ayala which is well known in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Other music is shalat which does not involve any type of instruments.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is a recently created country with a history entwined with various empires, such as those of Portugal and the United Kingdom. The Romans also exerted influence in the Persian Gulf. Envoys from the Islamic prophet Muhammad saw the islands convert to Islam around 630 C.E.\n\nLater in the 16th century the Portuguese would battle the then dominant force in the Persian Gulf, the Safavid dynasty, for control of the region. During the 17th century, the Ottomans took control of the islands and UAE was known as the \"Pirate Coast.\" By the 19th century, the British Empire had taken complete control of the land then called the Trucial States. Oil was discovered in 1959. The Trucial States were under the control of the British Empire until 1971. Consequently, with weakening British control, the Trucial States became the UAE in 1971 with Ras al-Khaimah joining in 1972.\n\nThe term \"Emirati\" comes from the Arabic word \"emir\" () which means \"commander\". Each emirate is ruled by an emir. The Bani Yas tribe forms the basis of many clans within the UAE. Sub-clans of the Bani Yas include\n\n\nThe term \"Emirati\" also refers to Arabs with origins in the UAE. Many modern Emirati names are derived from these tribal names or offshoots of these tribes, for instance Mazroui (from Mazari), Nuaimi (from Naim) and Al Sharqi (from Sharqiyin).\n\nEmiratism (or Emirianism) is the advocacy of Emirati national identity. The government promotes Emiratism by procuring nationals with preferential treatment on several socio-political platforms. This is accomplished through several means, such as increasing the visibility of Emirati culture, by preserving Emirati cultural identity, and by preferentially employing Emiratis in the workforce. The latter policy is referred to as Emiratisation by the government.\n\nThe word Emirati is an English word derived from a combination of the word emir, which is an Islamic leader, and the English suffix \"-ate\". It gradually came to mean the United Arab Emirates. The demonym Emirian has a similar root from except with the suffix \"-ian\" being added to emir. Rarer Emirian demonyms and adjectives include \"Emiri\" and \"Emiratian\", both of which are unofficial and informal alternatives. However, due to strong tribal allegiances, many Emiratis also self-identify by their tribal affiliations, whereby some Emiratis may call themselves a \"Bani Yasi\", \"Suweidi\" or an \"al-Shamsi\", especially if they come from an influential tribe. Historically, Emiratis were called \"Trucial Coasters\" or \"Trucials\".\n\nFalcon training is one of the UAE's national symbols. These birds can be seen on the coat of arms of the United Arab Emirates. They were traditionally used for hunting, and trained by the Bedouin tribes. Most Emiratis view Sheikh Zayed as an essential component of Emirati nationalism, Emiratis are proud of their nations global name associated with tourist prospects, prefer interactions with fellow nationals, most are computer literate and adult Emiratis past born in the 21st century are more likely to be bilingual These are many landmarks and sculptures in the country of teapots, water jugs and coffeemakers to symbolize the hospitality of the Emirati people. Due to the pearl-diving history of the Emirates, nautical sailing and other activities at sea are sometimes emphasized. Due to its prominence throughout Emirati history in cultivation, datefruits play an important role in Emirati life. Another national symbol is the arabic coffee pot with the elongated thin spout called a Dallah; a sign of Emirati generosity.\n\nThe population of the UAE as of 2016 was 9.1 million with a minority being Emiratis. UAE nationals in 2010 were 947,997 composed of 479,109 males and 468,888 females.\nStatistics for UAE nationals in 2010 are as follows:\nNon-emirati origin populations form the vast majority of the of UAE (88.52%) and is composed of expatriates, with the largest groups hailing from South Asian countries such as India (2.62 million), Pakistan (1.21 million) and Bangladesh (706,000). There are also nationals of other GCC and Arab countries who live in the UAE. Members of other Asian communities, including Iran (454,000), the Philippines (530,000).\n\nEmirati Arabic is a variety of Arabic used in the UAE.\n\nIslam is largest and the official state religion of the UAE and the government follows a policy of tolerating existence of other religions, through the Ministry of Tolerance.\n\nThere are approximately 31 churches throughout the country, one Hindu temple in the region of Bur Dubai, 2 Sikh Gurudwaras, with the biggest one located in Jebel Ali district of Dubai and a Buddhist temple in the Al Garhoud of Dubai. Emiratis are largely Muslims, approximately 85% of whom are Sunni and the remaining 15% are Shia.\n\nThe government imposes restrictions on marriage for its citizens. Muslim Emirati women are forbidden by law from marrying men of \"the book\" (referring to Christians and Jews), while Muslim Emirati men are allowed to marry women of \"the book\". In UAE, a union between a Muslim Emirati woman and a man of \"the book\" is punishable by law, since it is considered a form of \"fornication\".\n\nEmirati ancestry, the result of emigration, also exist in other parts of the world, most notably in the Arabian Peninsula, Europe and North America. Population estimates are seen to have a very small diaspora, mainly because the UAE provides them with more than adequate welfare benefits, removing the need to live and work in other developed countries.\n\nIn recent years, many Emiratis who wear traditional attire have complained about being discriminated against by expatriates living in the UAE. Emirati men who wear the kandura or the women who wear the abaya have been turned away from certain leisure activities like visiting the beach, bowling in Dubai Outlet Mall or skiing at Ski Dubai. Emiratis have also complained of chronic overcharging in various shops and restaurants. Those wearing the Kandura are reportedly being charged triple amounts for goods and services, mainly because of public misconceptions that all Emiratis are rich.\n\n"}

As the son of heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne, he starred on MTV's reality series \"The Osbournes\" (2002–05), along with his father, mother Sharon, and sister Kelly. Osbourne has since pursued a career as a fitness and travel reporter, presenting shows such as \"\" (2005–09) and BBC's \"Saving Planet Earth\" (2007). He was diagnosed with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in 2012. In 2016, he and his father Ozzy travelled the world in the History Channel reality series \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour\".\n\nOsbourne was born in London to heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne of Black Sabbath, and his wife and manager, Sharon ( Levy). He has two elder sisters, Aimee and Kelly Osbourne, as well as two paternal half-siblings, Louis John Osbourne and Jessica Hobbs, from his father's previous marriage. Osbourne has stated that his childhood was \"perfectly happy and contented\". For the first six years of his life, he lived in the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire. When he was six, his parents moved the family to Los Angeles, but a year later the family returned to Buckinghamshire. When Osbourne was 11, the family moved back to Southern California, but this time to Beverly Hills. In spite of moving so many times at a young age, Osbourne did not find it disruptive.\n\nThe only aspect of his life that constant moving did affect was his school life, and Osbourne soon despised going to school, which was not helped by the fact that he was diagnosed with a form of dyslexia at the age of eight, and ADHD at the age of 10. At the time, he was studying at a Christian school in Los Angeles. He returned to England for a year before returning to Los Angeles, where he was enrolled into the special needs Park Century School. At 14 he was offered an internship at Virgin Records, where his mother was managing the band The Smashing Pumpkins. After Sharon stopped managing that band, Osbourne started A&R scouting for Epic Records, where his father had been on for many years. Osbourne also helped his mother in managing his father's annual touring festival, Ozzfest, advising her about up-and-coming bands.\n\nOn his 13th birthday, Osbourne got drunk for the first time on whisky; by the time he was 14, he was drinking regularly and had started smoking marijuana. He started partying heavily, and made headlines on 21 April 2003 when he was admitted to a child psychiatric ward for an addiction to OxyContin. Osbourne's drug addiction escalated after his mother was diagnosed with cancer; he was as well battling with his own depression. His self-destructive behaviour came to a head when he attempted suicide by taking a cocktail of prescription pills and cutting his hands with shards of glass after hearing his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend pick up her phone when he called her. He woke up 12 hours later. Osbourne continued with his drug use until he realized that he \"never wants to feel this way ever again\" and admitted himself into an adolescent psychiatric ward. He spent 10 days detoxing and was moved to an adolescent rehabilitation center in Malibu, where he enrolled in a recovery program.\n\nOsbourne gained high visibility in 2002 after appearing in his family's reality television show \"The Osbournes\", which aired on MTV and won an Emmy Award in 2002. In the show, Osbourne was mostly shown as a rebellious teenager who liked to party and to fight with sister Kelly Osbourne. In a song by Tenacious D advertising \"The Osbournes\", Jack Black sings the line \"and he's got a big 'fro on his head\" to describe Osbourne's curly hair that grew longer until he eventually shaved it off in the third season of the show. In 2002, Osbourne briefly appeared in \"\" along with the rest of his family, and subsequently starred in a Super Bowl XXXVI advertisement for Pepsi Twist with sister Kelly. From 2002 to 2003, Osbourne appeared in Season 6 of \"Dawson's Creek\", playing Audrey's childhood friend. He also made cameos in \"The X Factor\" (as a \"Goth rapper\" who sings \"Ice Ice Baby\"), the fifth season of \"That '70s Show\" and as a dining room guest in the eighth season of \"Hell's Kitchen\". Post-rehab, Osbourne went on in 2003 to star in his own show on Channel 4, \"Union Jack\". In 2004 he played a small role in \"New York Minute\", a film starring the Olsen twins, in which he plays a music promoter named Justin.\n\nIn 2005, Osbourne started to show more of an interest in fitness through co-hosting the ITV2 show, \"Celebrity Wrestling: Bring It On!\". In February that year, he appeared in \"Extreme Celebrity Detox\" in which he took part in t'ai chi and climbing exercises, which possibly inspired him to appear in his own programme, \"\" produced by the same production company (Ginger Productions) as \"Extreme Celebrity Detox\". Osbourne lost (50Lb) 23 kg in Thailand at a Muay Thai martial arts camp in Pattaya in order to be fit enough to climb El Capitan (which he achieved) whilst filming the first series of \"\". It aired on ITV2 in the UK, the Travel Channel in the United States, The LifeStyle Channel in Australia, GOtv in South Africa and on MuchMusic in Canada. \"\" focuses on Osbourne's training for sports like rock climbing, mountaineering and a jungle trek in Belize from the Chiquibul Chamber through dense jungle ending at Caracol ruins (guided by the UK extreme conservation organisation \"Trekforce\"). He showcased the effects of his weight loss with the two semi-naked photo shoots for Cosmopolitan magazine in 2005 to raise awareness of testicular cancer. The first, taken in June 2005, shows him sitting on a motorbike; the second appeared in the December 2005 issue. After the first series of \"\" he began filling in for Stephen Mulhern on CITV's Saturday morning kids' show \"Holly & Stephen's Saturday Showdown\" (the show has now ended). Osbourne took part in Sport Relief and faced former singer in the band S Club 7, Bradley McIntosh, in a boxing match of three one-minute rounds to raise money for the charity. Osbourne won by a unanimous decision.\n\nHe once claimed to be considering a career in law enforcement and was on reality television show \"Armed & Famous\". The show was pulled from CBS in January 2007, and Osbourne was sued by a woman from Muncie, Indiana, whose house was accidentally raided during filming. Osbourne also filmed a programme for the BBC's \"Saving Planet Earth\" series. In it he travelled to Namibia to highlight the tensions between elephants and the local people, and what can be done so that both groups can live peacefully beside one another. He also took part in the Mongol Rally with News Corporation director Andrew Knight's daughter, Amaryllis Knight. Their challenge was to drive a car with under 1000cc from London to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, for charity. Osbourne and his family reunited with a reality TV show on Fox that debuted 31 March 2009 but was cancelled after the first episode.\n\nOsbourne made and produced a documentary about his father that was originally to be titled to \"Wreckage of My Past: The Ozzy Osbourne Story\", but was changed to \"God Bless Ozzy Osbourne\". This film premiered in April 2011 at the Tribeca Film Festival and was released on DVD in November 2011. In early August 2010, Osbourne directed his first music video, for his dad's song \"Life Won't Wait\" from the album \"Scream\". The video debuted on 23 August. Osbourne worked for Fuse News from February 2013 to early 2014. Osbourne also had a paranormal investigation show titled \"Haunted Highway\" that aired on Syfy for two six-episode seasons, during the summers of 2012 and 2013.\n\nAs of summer 2016, Jack was appearing with dad Ozzy in the U.S. worldwide buddy travelogue series, \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour\", on the History Channel.\n\nOsbourne and his wife, Lisa Stelly, have a daughter, Pearl Clementine Osbourne, born on 24 April 2012. Osbourne and Stelly were married in Hawaii on 7 October 2012. In August 2013, Osbourne and his wife announced they were expecting their second child, but on 6 September 2013, Osbourne's wife Lisa revealed she suffered a miscarriage in her second trimester; they had been expecting a son. He would have been named Theo. Their second child, daughter Andy Rose Osbourne, was born on 13 June 2015. They welcomed their third child, daughter Minnie Theodora Osbourne, on 3 February 2018. The couple announced their separation on 18 May 2018.\n\nIn June 2012, Osbourne announced that he had been diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. He had experienced symptoms for a number of years including blindness in one eye; numbness in both legs; and problems with his bladder, bowel, and stomach. Osbourne injects Copaxone medication daily, uses vitamin supplements and hormone replacement therapy, and has travelled to Europe for stem cell therapy. He has also made lifestyle changes such as minimising stress, exercising regularly, and significantly altering his diet. However, he has spoken of his fear of a rapid decline and has admitted that his doctors have urged him to stop participating in highly intensive physical workouts: \"Right now am I going to be in a wheelchair? No. But if I don't take care of myself, who knows.\" While appearing on \"Dancing with the Stars\" in October 2013, Osbourne said that he did not suffer from \"any severe symptoms other than the odd bit of tingling down my leg and the occasional bout of fatigue.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "242867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242867", "title": "Jean-Antoine Watteau", "text": "Jean-Antoine Watteau\n\nJean-Antoine Watteau (; baptised October 10, 1684 – died July 18, 1721), better known as Antoine Watteau, was a French painter whose brief career spurred the revival of interest in colour and movement, as seen in the tradition of Correggio and Rubens. He revitalized the waning Baroque style, shifting it to the less severe, more naturalistic, less formally classical, Rococo. Watteau is credited with inventing the genre of \"fêtes galantes\", scenes of bucolic and idyllic charm, suffused with a theatrical air. Some of his best known subjects were drawn from the world of Italian comedy and ballet.\n\nWatteau was born in October 1684 in the town of Valenciennes which had recently passed from the Spanish Netherlands to France. His father, Jean-Philippe Watteau, was a roofer given to brawling. Showing an early interest in painting, Jean-Antoine may have been apprenticed to Jacques-Albert Gérin, a local painter. Jean-Antoine's first artistic subjects were charlatans selling quack remedies on the streets of Valenciennes. Watteau left for Paris in 1702. There he found employment in a workshop at Pont Notre-Dame, making copies of popular genre paintings in the Flemish and Dutch tradition; it was in that period that he developed his characteristic sketchlike technique.\n\nBy 1705 he was employed as an assistant by the painter Claude Gillot, whose work represented a reaction against the turgid official art of Louis XIV's reign. In Gillot's studio Watteau became acquainted with the characters of the \"commedia dell'arte\" (its actors had been expelled from France in 1697), a favorite subject of Gillot's that would become one of Watteau's lifelong passions.\n\nAfterward he moved to the workshop of Claude Audran III, an interior decorator, under whose influence he began to make drawings admired for their consummate elegance. Audran was the curator of the Palais du Luxembourg, where Watteau was able to see the magnificent series of canvases painted by Peter Paul Rubens for Queen Marie de Medici. The Flemish painter would become one of his major influences, together with the Venetian masters he would later study in the collection of his patron and friend, the banker Pierre Crozat.\n\nIn 1709 Watteau tried to obtain the Prix de Rome and was rejected by the Academy. In 1712 he tried again and was considered so good that, rather than receiving the one-year stay in Rome for which he had applied, he was accepted as a full member of the Academy. He took five years to deliver the required \"reception piece\", but it was one of his masterpieces: the \"Pilgrimage to Cythera\", also called the \"Embarkation for Cythera\".\n\nWatteau lacked aristocratic patrons; his buyers were bourgeois such as bankers and dealers. Among his most famous paintings, beside the two versions of the \"Pilgrimage to Cythera,\" one in the Louvre, the other in the Schloss Charlottenburg, Berlin, are \"Pierrot\" (long identified as \"Gilles\"), \"Fêtes venitiennes\", \"Love in the Italian Theater\", \"Love in the French Theater\", \"Voulez-vous triompher des belles?\" and \"Mezzetin.\" The subject of his hallmark painting, \"Pierrot\" (\"Gilles\"), is an actor in a white satin costume who stands isolated from his four companions, staring ahead with an enigmatic expression on his face.\n\nWatteau's final masterpiece, the \"Shop-sign of Gersaint\", exits the pastoral forest locale for a mundane urban set of encounters. Painted at Watteau's own insistence, \"in eight days, working only in the mornings ... in order to warm up his fingers\", this sign for the shop in Paris of the paintings dealer Edme François Gersaint is effectively the final curtain of Watteau's theatre. It has been compared with \"Las Meninas\" as a meditation on art and illusion. The scene is an art gallery where the façade has magically vanished, and the gallery and street in the canvas are fused into one contiguous drama.\n\nWatteau alarmed his friends by a carelessness about his future and financial security, as if foreseeing he would not live for long. In fact he had been sickly and physically fragile since childhood. In 1720, he travelled to London, England, to consult Dr. Richard Mead, one of the most fashionable physicians of his time and an admirer of Watteau's work. However, London's damp and smoky air offset any benefits of Dr. Mead's wholesome food and medicines. Watteau returned to France and spent his last few months on the estate of his patron, Abbé Haranger, where he died in 1721, perhaps from tuberculous laryngitis, at the age of 36. The Abbé said Watteau was semi-conscious and mute during his final days, clutching a paint brush and painting imaginary paintings in the air.\n\nHis nephew, Louis Joseph Watteau, son of Antoine's brother Noël Joseph Watteau (1689–1756), and grand nephew, François-Louis-Joseph Watteau, son of Louis, followed Antoine into painting.\n\nLittle known during his lifetime beyond a small circle of his devotees, Watteau \"was mentioned but seldom in contemporary art criticism and then usually reprovingly\". Sir Michael Levey once noted that Watteau \"created, unwittingly, the concept of the individualistic artist loyal to himself, and himself alone\". If his immediate followers, Lancret and Pater, would depict the unabashed frillery of aristocratic romantic pursuits, Watteau in a few masterpieces anticipates an art about art, the world of art as seen through the eyes of an artist. In contrast to the Rococo whimsicality and licentiousness cultivated by Boucher and Fragonard in the later part of Louis XV's reign, Watteau's theatrical panache is usually tinged with a note of sympathy, wistfulness, and sadness at the transience of love and other earthly delights. Famously, the Victorian essayist Walter Pater wrote of Watteau: \"He was always a seeker after something in the world, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all.\"\n\nWatteau was a prolific draftsman. His drawings, typically executed in \"trois crayons\" technique, were collected and admired even by those, such as Caylus or Gersaint, who found fault with his paintings. In 1726 and 1728, Jean de Jullienne published suites of etchings after Watteau's drawings, and in 1735 he published a series of engravings after his paintings, \"The Recueil Jullienne\". The quality of the reproductions, using a mixture of engraving and etching following the practice of the Rubens engravers, varied according to the skill of the people employed by Jullienne, but was often very high. Such a comprehensive record was hitherto unparalleled. This helped disseminate his influence round Europe and into the decorative arts.\n\nWatteau's influence on the arts (not only painting, but the decorative arts, costume, film, poetry, music) was more extensive than that of almost any other 18th-century artist. The \"Watteau dress\", a long, sacklike dress with loose pleats hanging from the shoulder at the back, similar to those worn by many of the women in his paintings, is named after him. According to the 1911 \"Britannica\", \"in his treatment of the landscape background and of the atmospheric surroundings of the figures can be found the germs of Impressionism\". His influence on later generations of painters may have been less apparent in France than in England, where J.M.W. Turner was among his admirers. A revived vogue for Watteau began in England during the British Regency, and was later encapsulated by the Goncourt brothers and the \"World of Art\".\n\nIn 1984 Watteau societies were created in Paris, by Jean Ferré, and London, by Dr. Selby Whittingham. A major exhibition in Paris, Washington and Berlin commemorated the 1984 tercentenary of his birth. Since 2000 a Watteau centre has been established at Valenciennes by Professor Chris Rauseo. A catalogue of his drawings has been compiled by Pierre Rosenberg, replacing the one by Sir Karl Parker, and Alan Wintermute is preparing one for his paintings. \n\n\n"}

J. Bodmer and J. J. Breitinger were amongst his teachers.\n\nAt barely twenty-one years of age, Lavater greatly distinguished himself by denouncing, in conjunction with his friend Henry Fuseli the painter, an iniquitous magistrate, who was compelled to make restitution of his ill-gotten gains.\n\nIn 1769 Lavater took Holy Orders in Zurich's Zwinglian Church, and officiated until his death as deacon or pastor in churches in his native city. His oratorical fervor and genuine depth of conviction gave him great personal influence; he was extensively consulted as a casuist, and was welcomed with enthusiasm on his journeys throughout Germany. His writings on mysticism were widely popular as well.\n\nIn the same year (1769), Lavater tried to convert Moses Mendelssohn to Christianity, by sending him a translation of Charles Bonnet's \"Palingénésie philosophique\", and demanding that he either publicly refute Bonnet's arguments or convert. Mendelssohn refused to do either, and many prominent intellectuals took Mendelssohn's side, including Lichtenberg and Herder.\n\nLavater is most well known for his work in the field of physiognomy, \"Physiognomische Fragmente zur Beförderung der Menschenkenntnis und Menschenliebe\", published between 1775 and 1778. He introduced the idea that physiognomy related to the specific character traits of individuals, rather than general types.\n\nThe fame of this book, which found admirers in France and England as well as Germany, rests largely upon the handsome style of publication and the accompanying illustrations.\n\nThe two principal sources from which Lavater developed his physiognomical studies were the writings of the Italian polymath Giambattista della Porta, and the observations made by Sir Thomas Browne in his \"Religio Medici\" (translated into German in 1748 and praised by Lavater).\n\nAs a poet, Lavater published \"Christliche Lieder\" (1776–1780) and two epics, \"Jesus Messias\" (1780) and \"Joseph von Arimathia\" (1794), in the style of Klopstock. More relevant to the religious temperament of Lavater's times are his introspective \"Aussichten in die Ewigkeit\" (4 vols. 1768-1778), \"Geheimes Tagebuch von einem Beobachter seiner selbst\" (2 vols., 1772–1773), and \"Pontius Pilatus, oder der Mensch in allen Gestalten\" (4 vols., 1782–1785).\n\nFrom 1774 on, Goethe was intimately acquainted with Lavater, but later had a falling out with him, accusing him of superstition and hypocrisy.\n\nIn 1788 William Blake annotated Lavater's \"Aphorisms of Man\". Lavater published 632 aphorisms in all. Blake considered the following aphorism to be an excellent example of an aphorism. \"40. Who, under pressing temptations to lie, adheres to truth, nor to the profane betrays aught of a sacred trust, is near the summit of wisdom and virtue.\"\n\nDuring his later years, Lavater's influence waned, and he incurred considerable ridicule due to his vanity. His conduct during the French occupation of Switzerland brought about his death. On the taking of Zürich by the French in 1799, Lavater, while trying to appease the aggressors, was shot by an infuriated grenadier; he died over a year later, after protracted sufferings borne with great fortitude.\n\nThe Swiss artist and illustrator, Warja Honegger-Lavater, was a direct descendent of Johann Kaspar Lavater.\n\n\n\n"}

Eisenhower. Kennedy was nominated by the Democratic Party at the Democratic National Convention of 1960, taking place between July 11 and July 15, 1960. On July 15, 1960, Kennedy named Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas as his official running mate. Kennedy and Johnson won the election on November 8, 1960, defeating incumbent Vice President and Republican nominee Richard Nixon, who would later go on to be the 37th President of the United States. Kennedy and Johnson were sworn in as 35th President and 37th Vice President of the United States on January 20, 1961 respectively. Kennedy would serve as President of the United States until his death in November 1963.\n\nOn January 5, Kennedy received the endorsement of Michael DiSalle. \n\nKennedy won the New Hampshire primary on March 8 without facing any opposition. After the results came in, Kennedy expressed enthusiasm while in Madison: \"I'm very happy about it; we did better than I thought we would.\" \n\nThe next primary was in Wisconsin. The year prior to the primaries, in June 1959, Kennedy met Jerry Bruno, who had organized the campaign of William Proxmire for the U.S. Senate, JFK making the request for the latter to open a campaign headquarters for him in Milwaukee. On January 21, 1960, Kennedy announced his intent to compete in Wisconsin. Days before the primary, Kennedy said it had been the \"toughest, closest, most meaningful\".\n\nHumphrey's entry into the Wisconsin primary gave the Kennedy campaign the two objectives of decisively defeating him in most parts of the state to end his candidacy altogether and portray JFK's national appeal at capturing votes. In the West Virginia primary, one of the goals the Kennedy campaign had was to financially weaken Humphrey's campaign, alongside the use of attack ads against him.\n"}

He was also a prisoner in the American Revolutionary War and an officer in the United States Navy.\n\nDuring the War of Independence, Ingraham was a sailor captured by the British. He spent part of the war on a prison ship. In 1787, he was second mate aboard the \"Columbia Rediviva\" under the command of John Kendrick when it sailed to the Pacific Northwest to engage in the fur trade.\n\nOn September 16, 1790, Ingraham set sail from Boston as captain of the brig \"Hope\". The ship and venture were paid for by George Perkins. Ingraham's intention was to return to the northwest coast to partake in the fur trade. Ingraham and his ship sailed around Cape Horn on January 26, 1791.\nTheir next stop was at Madre de Dios Island in Chile on April 14. While in this Spanish port they took on some provisions before sailing north again. A few days later, on April 19, 1792, Ingraham discovered a small uncharted island group. These islands were situated roughly nine degrees south of the Equator. Captain Ingraham named the group Washington Islands, and named many of the individual islands: Washington Island for the president, Adams Island for the vice president, Federal Island, Franklin Island, Knox Island and Lincoln Island for a general. The island are approximately at 9° 20' south of the Equator and 140° 54' west of Greenwich. These islands are part of the Marquesas Islands. From the Marquesas archipelago, Ingraham sailed north to the Sandwich Islands before sailing on to the Queen Charlotte Islands on the northwest coast of North America.\n\nAfter arriving off the coast of North America, Ingraham set about trading for the fur pelts he was sent to bargain for from the natives. On September 26, 1792, Ingraham encountered his former captain, Captain Robert Gray, captain of the \"Columbia\", in Neah Bay off Cape Flattery. Gray was there to sell his small craft, , to the Spanish. \"Adventure\" was under the command of Ingraham's former shipmate Robert Haswell. The next day Ingraham and \"Hope\" set sail with the Spanish vessel \"Princesa\" that was sailing north to Nootka Sound to deliver Spain's new administrator to that outpost. After spending the summer trading for fur pelts from the natives along the coast, Ingraham sailed to China via the Sandwich Islands, and then back to Boston. On the journey to the Chinese mainland the ship log shows the crew passing by the island of Formosa. This voyage was a commercial failure.\n\nDuring the United States' undeclared Quasi-War with France in the late 1790s, Ingraham served as a naval officer. He was a lieutenant, last appearing on Navy Department records on June 14, 1799. Joseph Ingraham was lost at sea in fall 1800 while serving on the USS \"Pickering\".\n\nIngraham Bay and Ingraham Point, in Alaska, are named for Joseph Ingraham.\n\n"}
{"id": "44379533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44379533", "title": "Karl Kautsky", "text": "Karl Kautsky\n\nKarl Johann Kautsky (; ; 16 October 1854 – 17 October 1938) was a Czech-Austrian philosopher, journalist, and Marxist theoretician. Kautsky was recognized as among the most authoritative promulgators of Orthodox Marxism after the death of Friedrich Engels in 1895 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\n\nFollowing the war, Kautsky was an outspoken critic of the Bolshevik Revolution, engaging in polemics with Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky on the nature of the Soviet state.\n\nKarl Kautsky, born in Prague of an artistic and middle class family, his parents were Johann Kautsky (a scenic designer) and Minna (an actress and writer). The family moved to Vienna when Kautsky was the age of seven. He studied history, philosophy and economics at the University of Vienna from 1874, and became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) in 1875. In 1880 he joined a group of German socialists in Zürich who were supported financially by Karl Höchberg, and who smuggled socialist material into Germany at the time of the Anti-Socialist Laws (1878–1890). Influenced by Eduard Bernstein, Karl Höchberg's secretary, he became a Marxist and in 1881 visited Marx and Engels in England.\n\nIn 1883, Kautsky founded the monthly \"Die Neue Zeit\" (\"The New Times\") in Stuttgart, which became a weekly in 1890. He edited the magazine until September 1917: this gave him a steady income and allowed him to propagate Marxism.\nFrom 1885 to 1890 he spent time in London, where he became a close friend of Friedrich Engels. His position as a prominent Marxist theorist was assured in 1888, when Engels put him to the task of editing Marx's three-volume work \"Theories of Surplus Value\". In 1891 he co-authored the Erfurt Program of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) together with August Bebel and Eduard Bernstein.\n\nFollowing the death of Engels in 1895, Kautsky became one of the most important and influential theoreticians of Marxism, representing the mainstream of the party together with August Bebel, and outlining a Marxist theory of imperialism. When Bernstein attacked the traditional Marxist position of the necessity for revolution in the late 1890s, Kautsky denounced him, arguing that Bernstein's emphasis on the ethical foundations of Socialism opened the road to a call for an alliance with the \"progressive\" bourgeoisie and a non-class approach.\n\nIn 1914, when the German Social-Democrat deputies in the Reichstag voted for war credits, Kautsky (who was not a deputy but attended their meetings) suggested abstaining. Kautsky claimed that Germany was waging a defensive war against the threat of Czarist Russia. However, in June 1915, about ten months after the war had begun and when it had become obvious that this was going to be a sustained, appallingly brutal and costly struggle, he issued an appeal with Eduard Bernstein and Hugo Haase against the pro-war leaders of the SPD and denounced the German government's annexationist aims. In 1917 he left the SPD for the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), which united Socialists who opposed the war.\n\nAfter the November Revolution in Germany, Kautsky served as under-secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the short-lived SPD-USPD revolutionary government and worked at finding documents which proved the war guilt of Imperial Germany.\n\nAfter 1919, Kautsky's prominence steadily diminished. In 1920, when the USPD split, he went with a minority of that party back into the SPD. He visited Georgia in 1920 and wrote a book on the Democratic Republic of Georgia that at that moment was still independent of Bolshevist Russia. By the time it was published in 1921, Georgia had been thoroughly influenced by the Russian Civil War, the Red Army had invaded Georgia, and the Bolsheviks had imposed the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1924, at the age of 70, Kautsky moved back to Vienna with his family, and remained there until 1938. At the time of Hitler's Anschluss, he fled to Czechoslovakia and thence by plane to Amsterdam, where he died in the same year.\n\nKarl Kautsky lived in Berlin-Friedenau for many years; his wife, Luise Kautsky, became a close friend of Rosa Luxemburg, who also lived in Friedenau. A commemorative plaque marks where Kautsky lived at Saarstraße 14.\n\nVladimir Lenin described Kautsky as a \"renegade\" in his classic pamphlet \"The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky\"; Kautsky in turn castigated Lenin in his 1934 work \"Marxism and Bolshevism: Democracy and Dictatorship\":\n\nBoth Lenin and Trotsky, however, defended the Bolshevik Revolution as a legitimate and historic social upheaval akin to the French Revolution, casting themselves and the Bolsheviks in the role of the Jacobins, and viewing the \"opportunism\" of Kautsky and similar figures as a function of \"social bribery\" rooted in their increasing intimacy with the privileged classes.\n\nA collection of excerpts of Kautsky's writings, \"Social Democracy vs. Communism,\" discussed Bolshevist rule in Russia. He saw the Bolsheviks (or Communists) as a conspiratorial organization that had gained power by a coup and initiated revolutionary changes for which there was no economic rationale in Russia. Instead, a bureaucracy-dominated society developed, the miseries of which outweighed the problems of Western capitalism. He stated:\n\nAnd:\n\nKautsky died on 17 October 1938, in Amsterdam. His son, spent seven years in concentration camps; his wife Luise Kautsky died in Auschwitz.\n\nKautsky is notable for, in addition to his anti-Bolshevik polemics, his editing and publication of Marx's \"Capital, Volume IV\" (usually published as \"Theories of Surplus Value\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "577126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577126", "title": "Léon M'ba", "text": "Léon M'ba\n\nGabriel Léon M'ba (9 February 1902 – 28 November 1967) was the first Prime Minister (1959–1961) and President (1961–1967) of Gabon. A member of the Fang ethnic group, M'ba was born into a relatively privileged village family. After studying at a seminary, he held a number of small jobs before entering the colonial administration as a customs agent. His political activism in favor of black people worried the French administration, and as a punishment for his activities, he was issued a prison sentence after committing a minor crime that normally would have resulted in a small fine. In 1924, the administration gave M'ba a second chance and selected him to head the canton in Estuaire Province. After being accused of complicity in the murder of a woman near Libreville, he was sentenced in 1931 to three years in prison and 10 years in exile. While in exile in Oubangui-Chari, he published works documenting the tribal customary law of the Fang people. He was employed by local administrators, and received praise from his superiors for his work. He remained a \"persona non grata\" to Gabon until the French colonial administration finally allowed M'ba to return his native country in 1946.\n\nIn 1946, he began his political ascent, being appointed prime minister on 21 May 1957. He served as prime minister until 21 February 1961. In 1958, he directed an initiative to include Gabon in the Franco-African community further than before. He became president upon independence from France on 17 August 1960. Political nemesis Jean-Hilaire Aubame briefly assumed the office of president through a coup d'état in February 1964, but order was restored days later when the French intervened. M'ba was reelected in March 1967, but died of cancer in November 1967 and was succeeded by his vice president, Albert-Bernard Bongo.\n\nA member of the Fang ethnic tribe, M'ba was born on 9 February 1902 in Libreville, Gabon. His father, a small business manager and village chief, once worked as the hairdresser to Franco-Italian explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. His mother, Louise Bendome, was a seamstress. Both were educated and were among the first \"evolved couples\" in Libreville. M'ba's brother also played an important role in the colonial hierarchy; he was Gabon's first Roman Catholic priest.\n\nIn 1909, M'ba joined a seminary to receive his primary education. From 1920, he was employed as a store manager, a lumberjack and trader before entering the French colonial administration as a customs agent. Despite his good job performance, M'ba's activism in helping black Gabonians, particularly for the Fangs, worried his superiors. In September 1922, M'ba wrote to Edmond Cadier, Lieutenant-Governor of Gabon:\n\nHis remarks upset authorities, and he suffered the consequences in December 1922, when he was sentenced to prison after having committed a minor crime of providing a colleague with falsified documents.\n\nIn either 1924 or 1926, M'ba reconciled with colonial authorities and was chosen to succeed the deceased \"chef de canton\" (similar to a village chief) of Libreville's Fang neighbourhood. As the leader of a group of young Libreville intellectuals, he ignored the advice of elder Fangs and quickly gained a reputation as a strong, confident, and able-minded man. He once wrote in a letter that he was \"[m]issioned to enforce public order and defend the general interest\" and that he did \"not accept that people transgress the orders received from the authority that I represent.\"\n\nM'ba did not have an idealist vision of his job; he saw it as a way to become wealthy. With his colleague Ambamamy, he forced labour on the residents of the canton for his personal use, to cover his large expenditures. The colonial administration was aware of the embezzlement, but they chose to overlook it. However, beginning in 1929, the colonial administration started to investigate his activities after they intercepted one of his letters to a Kouyaté, secretary for the Ligue des droits de l'homme, who was accused of being an ally of the Comintern. Despite this suspected Communist alliance, the French authorities did not oppose M'ba's appointment as head chief of the Estuaire Province by his colleagues.\n\nIn those years, M'ba, a member of the Ligue, distanced himself from Roman Catholicism, but did not break completely with his faith. He instead became a follower of the Bwiti religious sect, which Fangs were particularly receptive to. He believed this would help revitalise a society which he felt had been damaged by the colonial administration. In 1931, the sect was accused of murdering a woman whose remains were discovered outside a market in Libreville. Accused of complicity, even though his involvement in the crime was not proven, M'ba was removed from power and sentenced to three years in prison and ten years of exile. Officially this was for embezzlement of tax revenues and his abusive treatment of the local labour force.\n\nWhile exiled in the French territory of Oubangui-Chari, first in the towns of Bambari and then Bria, he continued to exert influence among Fangs via correspondence with his compatriots in Libreville. Worried by the situation, Governor-General Antonetti ordered in 1934, at the end of his prison sentence, that M'ba be placed under surveillance.\n\nDuring his years in exile, he wrote about the customary rights of the Fang people in the \"Essai de droit coutumier pahouin\" () and published it in \"Bulletin de la société des recherches congolaises\" in 1938. This work quickly became the main reference on Fang tribal customary law. By 1939, the native ex-chief remained a \"persona non grata\" to Gabon, as stated in the letter from the head of the Estuarie Department, Assier de Pompignan:\n\nIn spite of being in exile, M'ba was employed by local administrators. Placed in secondary offices and having no proper power, he was an accomplished and valuable employee. Thanks to praiseworthy reports from his superiors, he was once again seen as a reliable indigenous element on which the colonial administration could rely on. In 1942, a sentence reduction was granted to him. Following his release, he became a civil servant in Brazzaville, where his prestige increased.\n\nIn 1946, M'ba returned to Gabon, where he was greeted exultantly by his friends. He was not reinstated as \"chef de canton\"; instead, he obtained an important position as store manager for the English trading house John Holt. That same year, he founded the Gabonese Mixed Committee (CMG), a political party close to the African Democratic Rally (RDA), an inter-African party led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny. The party's main objective was to obtain autonomy for its member states and oppose the Senegalese leader Léopold Sédar Senghor's idea of federalism. Playing on his past as a former exile, and through the network of Bwiti followers, M'ba managed to rally support from the Fang and Myènè peoples. His goal was to win indigenous administrative and judicial posts.\n\nBased on his success in Libreville, M'ba aspired, at one point, to become the head of the region, an idea which many notable Fangs supported during the Pahouin congress at Mitzic in February 1947. However, the colonial authorities refused to give him the position. Due to his relations with the RDA, which was linked to the French Communist Party, M'Ba was seen as a communist and propagandist in the colony; for the authorities, these suspicions had been confirmed when M'ba was involved in the 1949 RDA congress in Abidjan.\n\nIn 1951, the CMG decided to break its ties with the Communists, siding with the moderate position favored by Houphouët-Boigny while he did the same. At the same time M'ba, while maintaining his \"rebellious\" image to the electorate, became close with the French administration. However, the administration was already supporting his main opponent, Congressman Jean-Hilaire Aubame, who was M'ba's protégé and his half-brother's foster son. In the legislative elections of 17 June 1951, Aubame was easily re-elected, as M'ba only received 3,257 votes, just 11% of the electorate. In the territorial elections of March 1952, Aubame's Gabonese Democratic and Social Union (UDSG) won 14 of the 24 contested seats, against two for the CMG; however, the CMG received 57% of the votes cast in Libreville.\n\nInitially rejected by the Territorial Assembly, M'ba allied himself with French representatives in the assembly. However, using his charismatic traits and his reputation as a \"man of the people\", he managed to win a seat there in 1952.\n\nHe left the CMG to join the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG) led by Paul Gondjout in 1954, whom M'ba intended to overthrow. Gondjout, the secretary of the BDG, appointed M'ba secretary-general and formed a long term alliance against Aubame. In the legislative elections of 2 January 1956, M'ba received 36% of the votes versus 47% for Aubame. Though not elected, M'ba became the leader of the indigenous territory, and some of the UDSG began to ally themselves with him.\n\nIn the municipal elections of 1956, M'ba received support from the French logging industry, especially Roland Bru, and was elected mayor of Libreville with 65.5% of the vote. On 23 November he was appointed the first mayor of the capital. This has been cited as the BDG's first significant victory over the UDSG. In the French practice of holding multiple posts known as \"cumul des positions\", M'ba served as both mayor and deputy.\n\nIn the territorial elections of March 1957, his reputation as a \"forester's man\" worked against him; the BDG finished second again, winning 16 of the 40 contested seats, against 18 for the UDSG. Bru and other French foresters bribed several UDSG deputies to switch their political party to the BDG. M'ba's party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame's party after a recount. However, in the absence of an absolute majority, both parties were obliged to submit on 21 May 1957, a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable for election into the government. That same day, M'ba was appointed vice president of the government council under the French governor. Soon, divisions grew within the government, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a motion of censure against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21–19 vote. With M'ba's victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the party a majority with 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power.\n\nAfter voting in favor of the Franco-African Community, similar to the British Commonwealth, in the constitutional referendum of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo-politically independent. French journalist Pierre Péan asserted that M'ba secretly tried to prevent Gabonese independence; instead, he lobbied for it to become an overseas territory of France. In December 1958, the Assembly voted to establish the legislature, and then promulgated the constitution of the Republic of Gabon on 19 February 1959. On 27 February, M'ba was appointed Prime Minister. After M'ba openly declared for the departmentalization of Gabon in November 1959, Jacques Foccart, Charles de Gaulle's spin-doctor for African policy, told him that this solution was unthinkable. M'ba then decided to adopt a new flag by affixing the design of the national tree, the Angouma, over the French flag. Again, Foccart, as a loyal Frenchman, refused.\n\nFrom July 1958, a third political force tried to establish itself in Gabon: the Parti d'Union Nationale Gabonais (PUNGA), led by René-Paul Sousatte and Jean-Jacques Boucavel, created attempting to unite the southern Gabonese against the established BDG and UDSG. It was also supported by former UDSG members, \"radical\" students, and trade unionists. Though it voted against the constitutional referendum, PUNGA organised several events geared toward gaining independence and the holding of more parliamentary elections, which were also supported by the UDSG. In March 1960, after independence had already been obtained, M'ba cracked down on PUNGA, claiming its goal had already been reached. He filed an arrest warrant for Sousatte for conspiring against him and searched the houses of UDSG members, who he accused of complicity. Intimidated, three deputies of the UDSG joined the majority.\n\nOn 19 June 1960, legislative elections were organised through the \"scrutin de liste\" voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and obtains all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the month before full political independence of Gabon was achieved on 13 August, M'ba signed 15 cooperation agreements with France, pertaining to national defense, technical cooperation, economic support, access to materials, and national stability. On 17 August, independence was proclaimed. However, the Prime Minister realistically declared on 12 August, \"We must not waste our chances by imagining that with independence, we now own a powerful fetish that will fulfill our wishes. In believing that with independence everything becomes easy and possible, there is a danger of descending into anarchy, disorder, poverty, famine.\"\n\nM'ba aspired to establish a democratic regime, which, in his view, was necessary for the development and attraction of investments in Gabon. He attempted to reconcile the imperatives of democracy and the necessity for a strong and coherent government. Yet in practice, the regime showed a fundamental weakness in attaining M'ba's goal in which he, who had by this time become known as \"the old man\", or \"the boss\", would have a high degree of authority. A cult of personality developed steadily around M'ba; songs were sung in his praise and stamps and loincloths were printed with his effigy. His photograph was displayed in stores and hotels across Gabon, in government buildings hung next to that of de Gaulle.\n\nIn November 1960, a crisis broke out within the majority party. After deciding to reshuffle the cabinet without consulting Parliament, the president of the National Assembly, Paul Gondjout, a previous ally of M'ba's, filed a motion of censure. Gondjout supposedly hoped to benefit from a balance of power modified to his own advantage, and specifically sought the establishment of a strong parliament and a prime minister with executive power. M'ba, who did not share these ideas, reacted repressively. On 16 November, under the pretext of a conspiracy, he declared a state of emergency, ordering the internment of eight BDG opponents and the dissolution of the National Assembly the day after. Electors were asked to vote again on 12 February 1961. Gondjout was sentenced to two years in prison. Sousatte, who also opposed the constitution, was also sentenced to the same amount of jail time. Upon their releases, M'ba appointed Gondjout president of the economic council and Sousatte Minister of Agriculture, both mostly symbolic posts.\n\nOn 4 December, M'ba was elected to replace Gondjout as Secretary General of the BDG. He turned to the opposition to strengthen his position. With Aubame, he formed a number of sufficiently balanced political unions to appeal to the electorate. On 12 February, they won 99.75% of the vote. The same day, M'ba was elected President of Gabon, being the only candidate. In thanks for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister to replace André Gustave Anguilé.\n\nOn 21 February 1961, a new constitution was unanimously adopted, providing for a \"hyperpresidential\" regime. M'ba now had full executive powers: he could appoint ministers whose functions and responsibilities were decided by him; he could dissolve the National Assembly by choice or prolong its term beyond the normal five years; he could declare a state of emergency when he believed the need arose, though for this amendment he would have to consult the people via a referendum. This was, in fact, very similar to the constitution adopted in favor of Fulbert Youlou at roughly the same time. A report from the French secret service summarized the situation as follows:\n\nThe new constitution and the National Union (a political union they founded) suspended the quarrels between M'ba and Aubame from 1961 to 1963. Despite this, political unrest grew within the population, and many students held demonstrations on the frequent dissolutions of the National Assembly and the general political attitude in the country. The president did not hesitate to enforce the law himself; with a chicotte, he whipped citizens who did not show respect for him, including passersby who \"forgot\" to salute him. In addition, in February 1961, he decreed the internment of approximately 20 people for these demonstrations.\n\nOn 9 February 1963, the President pardoned those arrested during the political crisis of November 1960. On 19 February, he broke his ties with Aubame; all UDSG representatives were dismissed, with the exception of M'ba supporter Francis Meye. In an attempt to oust Aubame from his legislative seat, M'ba appointed him President of the Supreme Court on 25 February. Thereafter, M'ba claimed that Aubame had resigned from the National Assembly, citing incompatibility with parliamentary functions. Aubame resolved the problem by resigning from his post on the Supreme Court, complicating matters for M'ba. Faced with reports of tension between the government and the National Assembly, even though 70% of it were BDG members, the Gabonese president dissolved the legislature on 21 January 1964 as an \"economy measure\".\n\nThe electoral conditions were announced as such: The election 67 districts were reduced to 47. M'ba disqualified Aubame by announcing anyone who held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M'ba's idea was that no party other than his would have the money to enter candidates. In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections that they did not consider fair.\n\nFrom the night of 17 February to the early morning of 18 February 1964, 150 Gabonese military personnel, headed by Lieutenant Jacques Mombo and Valére Essone, arrested President of the National Assembly Louis Bigmann, French commanders Claude Haulin and Major Royer, On Radio Libreville, the military announced to the Gabonese people that a coup d'état had taken place, and that they required technical assistance and told the French not interfere in this matter. M'ba was instructed to broadcast a speech acknowledging his defeat. \"The D-Day is here, the injustices are beyond measure, these people are patient, but their patience has limits\", he said. \"It came to a boil.\"\n\nDuring these events, no gunshots were fired. The people did not react strongly, which according to the military, was a sign of approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. The plotters were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.\n\nSecond Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave instructions to transfer M'ba to Ndjolé, Aubame's electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed president and his captors took shelter in an unknown village. The next morning they decided to take him over the easier road to Lambaréné. Several hours later, they returned to Libreville. The new head of government quickly contacted French ambassador Paul Cousseran, to assure him that the property of foreign nationals was protected and to ask him to prevent any French military intervention.\n\nBut in Paris, de Gaulle decided otherwise. M'ba was one of the most loyal allies to France in Africa. While visiting France in 1961, M'ba said: \"All Gabonese have two fatherlands: France and Gabon.\" Moreover, under his regime, Europeans enjoyed particularly friendly treatment. The French authorities therefore decided, in accordance with signed Franco-Gabon agreements, to restore the legitimate government. Intervention could not commence without a formal request to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was otherwise occupied, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. However, he remained unaccounted for; therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. Less than 24 hours later, French troops stationed in Dakar and Brazzaville landed in Libreville and restored M'ba back into power. Over the course of the operation, one French soldier was killed, while 15 to 25 died on the Gabonese side.\n\nAfter he was reinstated into power, M'ba refused to consider the coup was directed against him and his regime. He believed it was a conspiracy against the state. Soon, however, anti-government demonstrations sprang up, with slogans such as \"Léon M'ba, président des Français!\" () or ones that called for the end of the \"dictatorship\". They showed solidarity after Aubame was charged on 23 March for his alleged involvement in the coup d'état. Despite the fact that he did not participate in the planning of the coup, Aubame was sentenced at his trial to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile.\n\nDespite these events, legislative elections, which were planned before the coup, were held in April 1964. The major opposition parties were deprived of their leaders, who were prevented from participating in the elections due to their involvement in the coup. The UDSG disappeared from the political scene, and the opposition consisted of parties that lacked national focus and maintained only regional or pro-democracy platforms. The opposition still won 46% of the votes and 16 of 47 seats, while the BDG received 54% of the vote and 31 seats in the assembly.\n\nHis French friends constantly surrounded him, protecting or providing him with counsel. A presidential guard was created by Bob Maloubier, a former French secret agent, and co-financed by French oil groups. The oil groups, active in the country since 1957, had strengthened their interests in 1962 after the discovery of offshore oil deposits. Gabon quickly became a major oil supplier for France. They carried such influence in Gabon that following the February 1964 coup, the decision to seek military intervention was taken by the CEO of Union Générale des Pétroles (UGP; now known as Elf Aquitaine), Pierre Guillaumat, Foccart, and other French businessmen and leaders. Later on, another UGP executive, Guy Ponsaillé, was appointed as political adviser to the president and became M'ba's representative in discussions with French companies. However, the Gabonese president was afraid of internal strife or assassination, so he remained secluded inside his heavily defended presidential palace. Ponsaillé helped M'ba obtain support from political moderates and accompanied him in his visits around the country in order to restore his reputation among the Gabonese people.\n\nFrench ambassador Cousseran and American ambassador Charles F. Darlington, suspected of sympathizing with Aubame, left shortly after the coup. The new French ambassador François Simon de Quirielle, a \"traditional diplomat\", was determined not to interfere in the internal affairs of Gabon. After a few months of misunderstandings with de Quirielle, M'ba contacted Foccart to tell him that he could no longer work with the Ambassador. Foccart recounted the events in his memoirs, \"Foccart Speaks\":\n\nAs a result of this incident, Foccart appointed a \"colonialist\", Maurice Delauney, as the new French Ambassador to Gabon.\n\nFrom 1965, the French began looking for a successor for M'ba, who was aging and sick. They found the perfect candidate in Albert Bernard Bongo (later known as Alhaji Omar Bongo Ondimba), a young leader in the President's cabinet. Bongo was personally \"tested\" by General de Gaulle in 1965, during a visit to the Élysée Palace. Confirmed as M'ba's successor, Bongo was appointed on 24 September 1965 as Presidential Representative and placed in charge of defence and coordination.\n\nIn August 1966, M'ba was admitted to the Hôpital Charles Bernard, a hospital in Paris. Despite his inability to govern, the president clung to his power. Only after a long insistence by Foccart did M'ba agree to appoint Bongo as Vice President in replacement of Yembit, announcing his decision through a radio and television message recorded in his room on 14 November 1966. A constitutional reform in February 1967 legitimized Bongo as M'ba's successor. The preparations for the succession were finalized by the early legislative and presidential elections held on 19 March 1967. Since no one dared to stand on the opposition ticket, M'ba was reelected with 99.9% of the vote, while the BDG won all seats in the Assembly.\n\nOn 28 November 1967, just days after he took his presidential oath at the Gabonese embassy, M'ba died of cancer in Paris, where he had been treated since August of that year. He was survived by his wife, Pauline M'ba, and 11 children. The day after M'ba's death, Bongo constitutionally succeeded him as President of Gabon. Gabon's main airport, the Leon M'ba International Airport, was later named for him.\n\nForty years after his death, the Léon M'ba Memorial was built in Libreville to honor his memory. President Bongo laid the cornerstone for the Memorial on 9 February 2007, and it was inaugurated by Bongo on 27 November 2007. In February 2008, it was opened to the public. In addition to serving as a mausoleum for M'ba, the Memorial is a cultural center.\n\n"}

Her father was a labourer. At the age of fifteen she started work as a maid in a butcher's family, and at sixteen she married a Wiltshire man called Henry Sommers, who was an alcoholic tailor. After three years living in England, they emigrated to New York in 1831 where Sommers died of Typhoid in 1833. Ann Trow Sommers was left alone with an infant daughter, Caroline, and forced to make a poor living as a seamstress and midwife.\n\nAnn remarried in 1836, to a German–Russian immigrant, Charles Lohman. Charles Lohman worked in the printing industry, and at the time was a printer for the \"New York Herald\". Lohman was a radical and freethinker, a friend and colleague of George Matsell, the publisher of the radical journal the \"Free Inquirer\". With Matsell, Lohman was involved in the publication of Robert Dale Owen's book \"Moral Physiology; or, a Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question\" (1831) and Charles Knowlton's \"Fruits of Philosophy; or, The Private Companion of Young Married People\" (1831) \n\nAnn's brother, Joseph Trow, had also emigrated to New York, and was working as a sales assistant in a pharmacy. Ann continued to develop an interest in women's health.\n\nCharles and Ann developed a story to validate Ann's interests in midwifery and women's health. According to their story, she had travelled to Europe to train in midwifery with a renowned French physician named Restell. She began selling patent medicine, and (probably in partnership with her husband and brother) creating birth control products such as \"preventative powders\" and \"Female Monthly Pills\", advertised under the name \"Madame Restell\". She sold these products through the post and performed house visits. When these \"Monthly Pills\" proved insufficient for a woman to end a pregnancy and thus maintain good standing in society, Restell devised another solution. Self-professed doctors and pharmacists, she and her husband became surgeons. The new title ensured more profitable procedures could be performed under the same legal penalty given for offering medication-induced abortions. Abortifacients used in this era were often blends of herbs such as ergot, calomel, aloe, or black hellebore. These were thought to upset the digestive tract, inducing a miscarriage. Surgical abortions included rupturing the amniotic sac, or dilating the cervix (premature labor), or even in-utero decapitation.\n\nMadame Restell advertised her services as a \"Female Physician\" in newspapers such as the \"Herald\" and even the \"New York Times.\" She and her husband Charles operated out of a large brownstone mansion on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street. \n\nWhen Restell began her business, abortions were hardly illegal. Only surgical abortions were forbidden. This was only after the quickening, that is, when the woman started to feel the fetus move (this was typically around 4 months time). Soon, Restell's success began to attract copiers and competition. This drew the attention of the AMA, which officially launched a campaign in 1857 to end abortion. In order to rally support for their cause, the AMA targeted Restell, the most celebrated abortionist and deemed her the enemy. The term \"Restellism\" became a euphemism for abortion. With the swift changes of law in New York, Restell was constantly being hounded by authorities and anti-abortion crusaders to end her practice.\n\nShe was also met with opposition from the press. Enoch E. Camp and George Wilkes' \"National Police Gazette\" covered New York's \"crime news\" and detailed stories about theft, abortion, and rape, among others. Coverage was not limited to New York but rather extended to major cities throughout the United States and Europe. The Gazette claimed that in addition to performing abortions, \"…most of the abandoned infants found almost daily throughout the city came from her [Restell's ] establishment.\"\n\nConservative editors such as Samuel Jenks Smith of the New York Sunday Morning News also publicly condemned Restell's profession. On July 7, 1839—the earliest press's attack on Restell—his editorial claimed her business \"…strikes at the root of all social order.\" According to Smith, doctors believed Restell was engaging in dangerous work, and that \"...what she was doing was impossible without endangering the lives of the patients.\" Her work was considered \"sinful.\"\nBut exposure of this controversy was not limited to men. Female journalists also engaged in undercover operations to shed light on illegal abortions in cities such as Chicago, with one example being the Chicago Times' \"Girl Reporter.\" This unidentified woman exposed physicians like the Chicago Medical Society's Dr. J.H. Etheridge, Dr. John Chaffee, and Dr. Edwin Hale. At her pleadings, these doctors and others agreed to perform abortions and thus violate the 1867 Illinois statute penalizing such procedures.\n\nMadame Restell became so well known throughout New York City that copies of her trials were published in the \"Times\" and the \"Police Gazette.\" She was listed as a New York City attraction in NYC tour guides.\n\nIn 1840, a patient named Maria Purdy accused Restell of causing tuberculosis through the abortion procedure. The press erupted with slander against Restell, calling her \"the monster in human shape\" and charging her with acts against God. Restell promised monetary compensation for anyone who could prove her methods were dangerous, and while she was initially found guilty, her appeal overturned said verdict. Her uneasy relationship with public opinion continued.\n\nMary Applegate was an unmarried woman, a mistress, who had been sent to Madame Restell from Philadelphia by her illicit lover. The father had arranged for Restell to adopt the baby out. Applegate was unaware of this deal until she had returned to Philadelphia and was greeted coldly by her former lover. Applegate then went back to Restell to ask for her child back, but Restell claimed to know nothing of the infant. Restell was immediately painted as the villain by the press in publications such as the \"New York Medical and Surgical Reporter.\"\n\nIn 1841, Mary Rogers was found dead in the Hudson River. Newspapers suggested that she had died during an abortion carried out by Restell.\n\nAbortion was soon outlawed by the state of New York in 1845. This law further restricted the previous laws from a decade earlier. An abortion that resulted in the death of the mother or was performed after the \"quickening\" was second degree manslaughter. A new addendum to the law made selling abortifacients or performing abortions at any stage during the pregnancy a misdemeanor punishable by a mandatory year in jail. Additionally, women who sought after an abortion or attempted their own abortion were fined $1000. Abortion became legally defined as an obscene subject and was no longer covered in the papers. Women were no longer allowed to freely discuss abortion. Restell skirted the legalities by advertising her services as methods to regulate menses.\n\nIn 1847, Charges were again brought against Restell for performing an abortion, which led to a conviction.\nThis conviction, however, was \"universally hailed,\" and media coverage of the trial prompted discussion surrounding for-profit abortions performed by physicians. Furthermore, it was noted that the victims were typically \"poor, uneducated women\" from New England and Connecticut who came to New York for abortions.\nMaria Bodine was sent to Madame Restell by her master so that she could procure an abortion from Restell. Restell determined that Maria was too far along to have an abortion, but Maria's master insisted. Finally, he paid Restell heavily and she agreed to perform Maria's abortion. Maria then returned to her job as a maid. She fell ill and upon visiting a doctor, was forced to admit her abortion. Restell was taken to trial. During this case, Madame Restell's defense painted Bodine as a \"loose\" woman whose injuries were a result of syphilis and had nothing to do with Restell, while Maria Bodine's lawyers cast Restell as a godless incompetent woman. Restell lost the case and was charged with a misdemeanor and a one-year prison sentence which was on Blackwell's Island.\n\nAfter Madame Restell finished her sentence, she reworked her business. She removed surgical abortions entirely, and concentrated her efforts on pills and her boarding house. In 1854, Restell applied for US citizenship and was granted it. Evidence given in a breach-of-promise case in 1854 suggests Restell and her husband were charging between $50 and $100 per abortion at this time and had a regular clientele. Prior to the 1845 law, Restell was charging her clients on a sliding scale according to social class. Many of Restell's wealthier patients were charged the upwards of $1000. While Madame Restell dialed back her business, the press did not leave her reputation to rest. She was dubbed \"The Wickedest Woman in New York\".\n\nIn 1855, Frederica Medinger, a German immigrant, approached Restell entreating as to room to stay in until the birth of her child According to Medinger, Restell gave her six pills at the time of the birth. A day after the birth, Medinger asked for her child and was told by Mme. Restell that the child had disappeared. The Madame was accused of kidnapping and being too greedy. When Restell was brought to court, Medinger did not show. Many assumed Restell had paid her to drop the case. Restell was dismissed and the woman and her baby were never heard of again. It is assumed the child was adopted out by Restell.\n\nThe various reactions to Restell and her New York practice echoed general attitudes toward abortion in the United States. Traveling salesmen in cities such as Boston and Philadelphia heard of her financial success and sold pills to capitalize on similar profits. Before her own legal troubles, Restell heard stories of abortionists in Philadelphia and Lowell, Massachusetts indicted for murder—indicators of growing opposition to the practice on a national scale. A similar case was that of Dr. John Stevens, a physician who performed an abortion on a young Boston woman named Gallagher. Her death, a consequence of this high-risk operation, prompted Stevens to be accused of murder.\n\nThough the Civil War distracted many Americans from the abortion debate, its end allowed some physicians to return to their anti-abortion campaign.\n\n\"Since the embryo, they argued, was fully alive from the point of conception, abortion at any point in time—regardless of whether the mother had quickened or not—was murder pure and simple.\"\n\nWhile some physician took clear moral stances on the issue, others found their campaign increased the likelihood that untrained physicians would be penalized, thereby creating the potential to advance the activists' own professional goals.\n\nMadame Restell had amassed a fortune. She owned several plots of land, one of which featured an extravagant mansion. She had the finest horses, carriages, and silk dresses. The Civil War gave Mme. Restell the cover she needed to get her business back on her feet. Although she had been imprisoned once and accused numerous times, Restell appeared ultimately unscathed.\n\nPostal Inspector Anthony Comstock was an influential moral reformer, who sought not only to regulate sexual activity, but the very way society thought about sex. He considered any information regarding the prevention or termination of a pregnancy to be pornographic. In 1873, the US Congress enacted the \"Comstock Law,\" which made it illegal to discuss or distribute anything considered obscene by the government. Breaking these laws were punishable by six months to five years in prison and a fine of $100-$2000.\n\nAnn Lohman was arrested by Comstock, who posed as a customer looking for birth control pills and brought the police around the next day to have her arrested. Bail was set at $1000. Madame Restell was said to have reached into her purse to pull out $10,000, but the judge would only accept regular bail bonds, so Restell had to pay a bondsman. Following Restell's arrest in early 1878, a maid discovered Restell in the bathtub at her Fifth Avenue home; she had slit her own throat on the morning of April 1, 1878. Upon her death, she was found to be worth between $500,000-$600,000 ($12.4 million-$14.9 million in present-day terms).\n\nAnn Trow Lohman is acknowledged as the inspiration for Kate Manning's heroine Annie \"Axie\" Muldoon in her historical novel \"My Notorious Life\", published on June 6, 2013 (UK) by Bloomsbury Publishing.\n\nMadame Restell is also a prominent character in Marge Piercy's historical novel, \"Sex Wars\", which depicts the social and political climate surrounding women's sexual, physical, and reproductive activities during the Gilded Age.\n\nRestell features as a minor character in Gore Vidal's novel 1876.\nRestell is also featured in Edward Rutherfurd's novel New York.\n\n\n\n"}

Usually portrayed as a warrior under King Arthur, he is noted for the darkness of his skin and his hideousness. He appears in the narratives about the bard Taliesin and in the Welsh Triads, where he is often contrasted with the angelically handsome Sanddef.\n\nHe appears in the \"Tale of Taliesin\", where he is depicted as the son of Ceridwen and Tegid Foel, and is given an extremely beautiful sister named Creirwy. In later versions of this tale his characteristic ugliness is transferred to a brother, Afagddu (Middle Welsh: \"Avagddu\"; from \"y fagddu\", \"utter darkness\"), though Ifor Williams suggested this name arose as a nickname for the famously gruesome Morfran. In the story, Ceridwen tries to help her son make his way in the world by creating a potion whose first three drops would bestow the drinker with knowledge of the future. She gives Gwion Bach (the bard Taliesin) the job of stirring the brew; he splashes three drops on his fingers and licks them, whereupon he gains the knowledge intended for Morfran/Afagddu, who remains ugly and despised. The story has a parallel in the Irish tale \"The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn\", in which the young hero Fionn mac Cumhaill receives prophetic wisdom intended for his master Finn Eces by consuming the Salmon of Knowledge.\n\nMorfran eil Tegid (Morfran son of Tegid) appears in several of the Welsh Triads. In Triad 24 he is recognized as one of the \"Three Slaughter-Blocks of the Island of Britain\", while Triad 41 celebrates his horse Guelwgan Gohoewgein (Silver-White, Proud and Fair) as one of the \"Three Lover's Horses of the Island of Britain\". Other manuscripts attribute this horse to Drystan (Tristan) and Ceredig ap Gwallawg. In other triads he is associated with Sanddef, whose beauty is as notable as Morfran's ugliness. In a triad preserved in the prose tale \"Culhwch and Olwen\", Morfran and Sanddef are named as two of the three men who survived the Battle of Camlann, in Morfran's case because his ugliness led everyone to believe he was \"a devil helping, for there was hair on his face like the hair of a stag.\" This triad was adapted in the 15th-century triad collection known as \"The Twenty-four Knights of Arthur's Court\"; the pair are two of the \"Three Irresistible Knights\", as their peculiarities made it \"repugnant to anyone to refuse them anything.\"\n\nMorfran is further mentioned in the 12th-century prose tale \"The Dream of Rhonabwy\". Rachel Bromwich notes that a 12th-century poem by Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr contains a reference to an otherwise forgotten early poet named Morfran, and suggests a connection with the Morfran of \"The Tale of Taliesin\" who was the intended recipient of the cauldron of poetic inspiration. Scholar Caitlin Green further suggests a connection with the character called \"Osfran's Son\", who is buried at Camlann according to the \"Englynion y Beddau\" (\"Stanzas of the Graves\").\n\n"}

He became a priest then studied civil law at the University of Orléans as well as at Cambridge, graduating as doctor of Civil Law.\n\nIn 1466 King was appointed Rector of Broughton, Hampshire, and in 1473 Warden of St John's Hospital, Dorchester. Under the new regime of Edward IV of England he was appointed Clerk of the Signet in 1473, in 1475 was sent as ambassador to the Duke of Brittany.\n\nOn 18 March 1476, Oliver King Master of the seven liberal Arts and Licentate in Laws, became the king's 'first and principal Secretary' for the French tongue for life, and succeeded William Hatteclyffe as king's secretary in 1480.; and receiving the salary of £20 per annum. Supposedly being expert in \"the French language\" Dr King was effectively second secretary, dischargng the duties of the Signet in Hatteclyffe's absence. Under Edward IV the Secretary's office expanded the number of clerks to at least four, with a Gentleman and \"writers of the King's Signet under him\".\nThe Secretary and his clerks pay for their carriage of harness in court, except a little coffer to which the king's warrants and bills are signed, and other letters and remembrances be kept ...Thiis coffer is carried at the King's cost, whereas the Controller will sign. The Secretary has 3 Getlemen-in-waiting on him for all that office. The remnant of all other servants to be found at his livery in the country delivered by the Herberger... he is out, ehe has a yeoman to keep chamber, eating at Chamberlain's board in the hall: both he and his clerks take clothing off the King's Wardrobe. During the early modern monarchy the Secretaries gradually assumed more importance, and standing at court, their office expanded and their salary improved to the same as the Clerk of the Council.\n\nIn 1480 he was appointed Canon of the eleventh stall at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, a position he held until 1503.\n\nKing was appointed Bishop of Exeter on 1 October 1492, consecrated on 3 February 1493. He was then translated to the see of Bath and Wells on 6 November 1495. He died on 29 August 1503.\n\nKing organised the restoration of Bath Abbey after 1500. The story of the refounding is told on the front of the Abbey in carved Bath stone. King had a dream in which he saw a host of angels on a ladder, the Holy Trinity and an olive tree with a crown on it. He heard a voice:\n\nKing believed this was a call for him to support the candidature of Henry Tudor as King, and to restore the Abbey. These images are carved on the West Front of the Abbey with coats of arms of the Montague Family (who paid for the carved wooden doors) and Henry VII's coat of arms. There are also statues of the twelve apostles, including a large statue of St Peter and one of Saint Paul.\n\n"}

{"id": "468899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=468899", "title": "Patrick Bateman", "text": "Patrick Bateman\n\nPatrick Bateman is a fictional character, the villain protagonist and narrator of the novel \"American Psycho\" by Bret Easton Ellis, and its film adaptation. He is a wealthy, materialistic Wall Street investment banker who leads a double life as a serial killer. Bateman has also briefly appeared in other Ellis novels and their film and theater adaptations.\n\nBateman works as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions at the fictional Wall Street investment firm of Pierce & Pierce (also Sherman McCoy's firm in \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\" and lives at 55 West 81st Street, Upper West Side on the 11th floor of the American Gardens Building (where he is a neighbor of actor Tom Cruise). In his secret life, however, Bateman is a serial killer murdering a variety of people, from colleagues to the homeless to prostitutes. His crimes—including rape, torture, necrophilia, and cannibalism—are described in graphic detail in the novel.\n\nBateman comes from a wealthy family. His parents have a house on Long Island, and he mentions a summer house in Newport. His parents divorced sometime earlier, while his mother became sick and now resides at a sanatorium. His father, who first appeared in Ellis' preceding novel \"The Rules of Attraction\", grew up on an estate in Connecticut, and now owns an apartment in the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. He is assumed to be dead as he is mentioned only in past tense during the novel. Bateman's younger brother Sean attends Camden College (and is a protagonist of Ellis' previous novel, \"The Rules of Attraction\", in which Patrick Bateman was first introduced). Bateman attended Phillips Exeter Academy for prep school. He graduated from Harvard College in 1984 and Harvard Business School two years later, and moved to New York City.\n\nBy the end of the novel, he believes he is about to be arrested for murdering a colleague named Paul Owen, and leaves a message on his lawyer's answering machine confessing to his crimes. When he runs into his lawyer at a party, however, the man mistakes him for somebody else and tells him that the message must have been a joke, as he had met with Owen only days earlier. Bateman realizes that the punishment and notoriety he desires will be forever out of his reach, and that he is trapped inside a pointless existence: \"This is not an exit\".\n\nAs written by Ellis, Bateman is the ultimate stereotype of yuppie greed; rich, shallow, and addicted to sex, drugs, and conspicuous consumption. All of his friends look alike to him, to the point that he often confuses one for another; they often confuse him for other people as well. Bateman takes delight in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his designer clothes, workout routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, elaborate high-end stereo and home theater sound system. He is engaged to an equally rich, shallow woman named Evelyn Richards. He has a mistress on the side and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman (and possibly the one person) in his life he has anything approaching feelings for is his secretary, Jean. He feels that she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow, so he cannot bring himself to seduce or kill her. He casually acknowledges her as \"Jean, my secretary who is in love with me\" and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he \"will probably end up married to someday\".\n\nDespite his affluence and high social status, Bateman is wracked by feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. He kills many of his victims because they make him feel inadequate, usually by having better taste than he does. He is deeply disliked by others as well—his friends mock him as the \"boy next door\"; his own lawyer refers to him as a \"bloody ass-kisser... a brown-nosing goody-goody\"; and he is often dismissed as \"yuppie trash\" by people outside his social circle.\n\nBateman often expresses doubts regarding his own sanity and he has periodic attacks of psychosis, during which he hallucinates. It is left open to interpretation whether Bateman actually commits the acts he describes, or whether he is merely hallucinating them; he is, therefore, an unreliable narrator. In the climax of the story, Bateman calls his lawyer and leaves a lengthy, detailed message confessing all of his crimes. He later runs into his lawyer, who mistakes him for someone else and dismisses the confession as a joke, also claiming to have had dinner with one of his victims after Bateman had supposedly killed him, leaving the supposed reality of Bateman's acts open to audience interpretation.\n\nAlthough Bateman often claims that he is devoid of emotion, he also describes experiencing moments of extreme rage, panic or grief—being on the \"verge of tears\"—often over trivial inconveniences such as remembering to return videotapes or trying to obtain dinner reservations. In the middle of dismembering a victim, he breaks down, sobbing that he \"just wants to be loved\". He takes psychotropics, like Xanax, to control these emotions. He publicly espouses a philosophy of tolerance, equality and \"traditional moral values\" because he thinks it will make him more likable. He also has a very nihilistic philosophy, believing that everything, such as morals, choices, principles, etc., are all ultimately meaningless.\n\nBateman compensates for these insecurities through obsessive vanity and personal grooming, with unwavering attention to detail. He buys the most fashionable, expensive clothing and accessories possible (e.g., Salvatore Ferragamo, Alan Flusser and Valentino suits, Oliver Peoples glasses and Jean Paul Gaultier, Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta leather goods) as a means of effecting some \"control\" over his otherwise chaotic life. Likewise, he categorizes people by what they wear and how they look because they are more easily \"understood\" in terms of labels and stereotypes. Bateman's apartment also is firmly controlled in terms of look and taste, with the latest music, food, and art.\n\nBateman kills more or less indiscriminately, with no preferred type of victim and no consistent or preferred method of killing. Throughout the novel, he kills men, women, animals, and, in one instance, a child. Bateman murders women mostly for sadistic sexual pleasure, often during or just after sex, and is also a prolific rapist. He kills men because they anger or annoy him or make him feel inferior. In the case of the child, Bateman wished to see if he would enjoy it, but found it unsatisfactory since the child's death would not affect as many people as an adult's would. Periodically, he matter-of-factly confesses his crimes to his friends, co-workers, and even complete strangers (\"I like to dissect girls, did you know I'm utterly insane\") just to see if they are actually listening to him. They either are not, or they think that he is joking.\n\nBateman made his first appearance in Ellis' 1987 novel \"The Rules of Attraction\" (in which Sean, his brother, is a main character); no indication is given that he is a serial killer. Bateman also makes a short appearance in Ellis' 1998 novel \"Glamorama\", with \"strange stains\" on the lapel of his Armani suit.\n\nBateman also appeared in the \"American Psycho 2000\" e-mails (transcribed here), which were written as an advertisement campaign for the movie. Although they are often mistakenly credited to Ellis, they were actually written by one or more unnamed authors and approved by Ellis before being sent out. \"American Psycho 2000\" served as a sort of \"e-quel\" to the original novel. The e-mails take place in 2000, a little over a decade since the novel. Bateman is in psychotherapy with a Dr. M. He is also married to Jean, his former secretary. They have a son, Patrick Bateman Jr. (P.B.), who is eight years old. In the story, Bateman talks about therapy, trying to get a divorce from Jean, his renewed feelings about murder, and idolizing his son. In the end, it is revealed that the 'real' Bateman, who 'writes' the e-mails, is the owner of the company that produces the movie.\n\nBateman appeared in Ellis's 2005 novel \"Lunar Park\", in which the fictionalised Bret Easton Ellis confesses that writing \"American Psycho\" felt like channeling the words of a violent spirit rather than writing anything himself. This ghost—Bateman—haunts Ellis's home. A character also comes to Ellis's Halloween party dressed as Patrick Bateman, and a copycat killer is seemingly patterning himself on Bateman. Toward the novel's end, Ellis writes the 'last' Bateman story as a way of confronting and controlling the character, as well as the issues Ellis created Bateman as a means of countering. Bateman, for all intents and purposes, dies in a fire on a boat dock.\n\nIn the Showtime series \"Dexter\", protagonist Dexter Morgan, himself a serial killer, uses the alias \"Dr. Patrick Bateman\" to acquire M-99 for the use of incapacitating his victims.\n\nOn March 8, 2018, the video game Criminal Case, which often parodies real people, combined the names of Patrick Bateman and Christian Bale to introduce a character named Christian Bateman, a young sociopathic venture capitalist who becomes a suspect in a murder after a body is discovered behind a wall in his apartment, but was cleared. He later became the suspect in the murder of a male stripper who attempted to get him to invest in a new night club and also cleared. He was eventually convicted of the murder of a performance artist who he fell in love with but rejected him. The game's in house psychologist had earlier diagnosed his victim as a sociopath.\n\nThough Christian Bale had been the first choice for the part by both Ellis and Harron, the producers offered the part to Keanu Reeves, Edward Norton, and Brad Pitt. Leonardo DiCaprio was set to play the character, but Ellis (as explained in the \"American Psycho\" DVD) decided he would appear too young, especially immediately after \"Titanic\". Bateman was also portrayed by Dechen Thurman, a brother of Uma Thurman, in the 2000 documentary \"This Is Not an Exit: The Fictional World of Bret Easton Ellis\". Michael Kremko played Bateman in the spin-off \"American Psycho 2\", in which the character is killed by a would-be victim. Aside from the character appearing in the film, the sequel has no other connection to the previous film and has been denounced by Ellis.\n\nScenes with the character were shot for the 2002 film adaptation of \"The Rules of Attraction\". Ellis revealed in an interview that director Roger Avary asked Bale to reprise the role, but Bale turned down the offer, and Avary asked Ellis himself to portray Bateman. Ellis refused, stating that he \"thought it was such a terrible and gimmicky idea\", and Avary eventually shot the scenes with Casper Van Dien. The scenes, however, were ultimately cut from the final version of the film.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with \"Black Book\", director Mary Harron said, \"We talked about how Martian-like [the character] Patrick Bateman was, how he was looking at the world like somebody from another planet, watching what people did and trying to work out the right way to behave, and then one day [Christian] called me and he had been watching Tom Cruise on David Letterman, and he just had this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes, and he was really taken with this energy.\"\n\n\"Doctor Who\" star Matt Smith played the role in the 2013 stage musical version of the novel, with music and lyrics by Duncan Sheik and a book by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, at London's Almeida Theatre. In 2016, Benjamin Walker portrayed Bateman in a Broadway production of the musical, which ran from March 21-June 5, 2016.\n\n"}

He attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and graduated with a degree in musical theater in 1999.\n\nDelaney first came to the attention of the public via Twitter, on which he started posting in 2009. By 2016, Delaney had over 1.2 million followers. While other comics were hesitant to share their material on social media, Delaney is considered one of the first comedians to use social media to publish jokes. Delaney credits comedy writer and director Graham Linehan with his rise in popularity after Linehan began responding to Delaney's tweets.\n\nIn 2010, \"Paste\" magazine named Delaney one of the ten funniest people on Twitter. In May 2012, he became the first comedian to win the 'Funniest Person on Twitter Award' at The Comedy Awards hosted by Comedy Central.\n\nDelaney has written several articles for \"Vice\" as well as \"The Guardian\".\n\nHis book \"Rob Delaney: Mother.

However, the series was never picked up by them.\n\nInstead, Delaney moved on to co-write and co-star with Sharon Horgan in \"Catastrophe\", that began airing in the UK on 19 January 2015. The show follows them after they get together following a brief affair while he is in the UK on business, and then moves there permanently after he learns that she has become pregnant.

Ellwood (born in Normal, Illinois in 1933) is an American academic, author and expert on world religions.\n\nHe was educated at the University of Colorado, Berkeley Divinity School and was awarded a PhD in History of Religions from the University of Chicago in 1967. He was Professor of World Religions at the University of Southern California from 1967 until 1997 and is now professor emeritus.\n\nRobert Scott Ellwood, Jr., was born July 17, 1933, in Normal, Illinois, the son of Robert Sr. and Knola Ellwood. Robert Sr. was a teacher in the high school affiliated with Illinois State Normal University, and a pioneer in the development of sociology as a high school subject. In 1945 the family moved to Chadron, Nebraska, where Robert Sr. became chair of the Education Department at the Nebraska State Teachers College located there. \n\nRobert Jr. graduated from Chadron Preparatory School in 1951, and from the University of Colorado in 1954. He then attended Berkeley Divinity School in New Haven, CT, an Episcopal seminary now affiliated with Yale Divinity School. He graduated and was ordained a priest in the Episcopal church in 1957. He pastored Christ Church, Central City, NE 1957-1960.\n\nIn 1961-62 Ellwood served as a chaplain in the U.S. Navy. While stationed in Okinawa and Japan he became interested in Japanese religion, and world religions generally. Reading the works of Mircea Eliade led to an interest in Eliade's structuralist and phenomenological approach to religion as a way of understanding similarities and differences in religions. As a consequence, in 1963 he entered the University of Chicago Divinity School's history of religion program led by Eliade, receiving the Ph.D. in 1967 after a final year of study in Japan. In 1965 he married Gracia Fay Bouwman, also a student in the U. of C. Divinity School and subsequently an instructor in Evansville College, Indiana.\n\nThey had two children, Richard Scott Lancelot (b. 1974) and Fay Elanor (b. 1977).\n\nIn 1967 Ellwood became a professor of religion at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, serving there until retirement in 1997. He mainly taught courses on Eastern religions and the history of religion. His first book, \"The Feast of Kingship\", about the \"Daijōsai\" or Japanese imperial accession ceremony, was based on his Ph.D. dissertation. Subsequently, given the tremendous spiritual ferment in California in the late 1960s, he became interested in new religious and spiritual movements in America, doing an informal survey of them in Los Angeles and publishing Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America.\n\nHe also wrote on the history of American religion in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as textbooks on world religions, religious studies, and Japanese religion. \"Cycles of Faith\" presented a theory of the comparative development of world religions. \"The Politics of Myth\" was a discussion of the controversial political histories of C.G. Jung, Mircea Eliade, and Joseph Campbell. A late series of three books offered a comparative view of mythologies. In 1988 he received a Fulbright Research Grant to study new religious movements in New Zealand, and spent six months there working in the national library in Wellington. He also taught briefly in the Universities of Cape Town and Natal in South Africa, and after retirement at Auburn University in Alabama. He was named Distinguished Emeritus Professor by U.S.C. in 2002, and Alumnus of the Year by the University of Chicago Divinity School in 2009. \n\nEllwood's approach to comparative religion has been fundamentally structuralist, phenomenological, and empathetic. He has sought through religion's material expression in art, architecture, rite, and practices to understand empathetically its inner meaning for adherents, always allowing for an immense range of individual responses, but recognizing also that religious forms have as it were a language of their own. In Cycles of Faith he further considers that the history of individual religions may have an internal dynamic of their own, as well as responding to outer history.\n\nIn 1976 Ellwood joined the Theosophical Society in America, serving as vice president of that organization 2002-05. He has also served as a priest in the Liberal Catholic Church, a small denomination informally affiliated with Theosophy. He offered a few books of popular spirituality through the Theosophical publishing house, Quest Books. After retirement he and Gracia Fay moved to Krotona, a Theosophical community in Ojai, CA.\n\n\n"}

Rui Pedro's mother denied the request, and told him to go play in an abandoned lot outside her office.\n\nRui Pedro's tutor called his parents because the child had not turned up for his 5pm lesson, and they quickly initiated a search for him. Because Rui Pedro had told his mother that he was planning to meet up with his friend Afonso, the police questioned the latter. Afonso Dias was in an emotional state while being questioned, and simply replied that he did not know the boy's whereabouts, but that the police \"should close the borders\".\nRui Pedro's cousin, Andre, recounted to the police that he, Rui Pedro and Afonso had had a conversation where Afonso had invited them to go meet up with a prostitute. Andre said he had not joined Rui Pedro and Afonso that afternoon because his mother would not let him leave the house.\n\nThe investigation into the child's disappearance slowed down due to the lack of credible leads. Nevertheless, the case had sparked public interest to a degree that sightings of Rui Pedro were numerous over the years since his disappearance.\nThe prostitute Alcina Dias confirmed that Afonso Dias had taken Rui Pedro to see her on the day he disappeared. Afonso Dias allegedly drove up to see her in his car and asked her if she was working. When she assented, he offered to pay her to have sex with Rui Pedro. Alcina Dias said that Rui Pedro was extremely nervous and crying by the time he exited the vehicle, reportedly saying that Afonso had forced him to meet her. Alcina Dias added that she tried to calm the boy down and asked him if his mother knew he was there, to which the boy replied no. Rui Pedro then allegedly drove off in Afonso Dias' vehicle. Alcina Dias allegedly tried to give her deposition to the authorities, but could never identify Afonso Dias by name. In 2011, she finally identified him in a court of law.\n\nIn April 1998, the political commentator Nuno Rogeiro traveled to Disneyland Paris with his family. During the trip, the Rogeiro family snapped several photographs whilst on a ride; one of these photos depicts a boy sitting behind the family who reportedly looks remarkably like Rui Pedro. Sat beside the boy is a man in his 40s wearing a red jacket. The Portuguese police did confiscate the photographs for further analysis, but no further progress was made regarding this sighting.\nOn September 1, 1998, 13 police forces busted an international child pornography ring known as the \"Wonderland Club\". The operative was code-named Operation Cathedral and resulted in the confiscation of 750,000 images and videos depicting 1,263 different children. Rui Pedro was among the few children (16 only) that could be identified. However, his whereabouts remain unknown. Police suspect that he was murdered by his abductors after being abused on camera for other members of the paedophile ring.\n\nRui Pedro's disappearance was widely covered by the Portuguese media and the case's developments continue to make headlines.\n\nDias was acquitted in the first trial in 2012 due to a lack of evidence, but was subsequently convicted in a new trial in 2014 to three years in jail for corruption of a minor, as a result of trying to make Rui Pedro have sex, but not for his abduction or any other charge related to the disappearance itself. Following an appeal by Rui Pedro's family. Despite Dias's appeal, this second ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Portugal. On October 3, 2014, Afonso Dias was sentenced to three years in prison. On March 18, 2015, Afonso Dias was taken to prison by his lawyer, after the warrant for his detention was issued by the police. He was released in March 2017, having served two thirds of his sentence. Dias maintains his innocence in the matter.\n\n"}
{"id": "19606216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19606216", "title": "Sheldon Cooper", "text": "Sheldon Cooper\n\nSheldon Lee Cooper, Ph.D., Sc.D., is a fictional character in the CBS television series \"The Big Bang Theory\" and its spinoff series \"Young Sheldon\", portrayed by actors Jim Parsons in \"The Big Bang Theory\" and Iain Armitage in \"Young Sheldon\" (with Parsons as the latter series' narrator). For his portrayal, Parsons has won four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a TCA Award, and two Critics' Choice Television Awards. The character's childhood is the focus of \"Young Sheldon\"; the series' first season is set in 1989 when 9-year-old prodigy Sheldon has skipped ahead five grades, to start high school alongside his older brother.\n\nSheldon is a senior theoretical physicist at Caltech and for the first ten seasons of \"The Big Bang Theory\", shares an apartment with his colleague and best friend, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). In season 10, Sheldon moves across the hall with his girlfriend Amy, in the former apartment of Leonard's wife Penny. He is a former child prodigy with genius-level IQ, but displays an almost total lack of social skills, a tenuous understanding of humor, and difficulty recognizing irony and sarcasm in other people, although he himself often employs them. He exhibits highly idiosyncratic behavior and a general lack of humility or empathy. He also lacks toleration. These characteristics provide the majority of the humor involving him, which has caused him to be described as the show's breakout character. Some viewers have asserted that Sheldon's personality is consistent with Asperger syndrome, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and asexuality. Co-creator Bill Prady has stated that Sheldon's character was neither conceived nor developed with regard to any of these traits, although Parsons has said that in his opinion, Sheldon \"couldn't display \"more\" traits\" of Asperger's.\n\nThe character of Sheldon Cooper was inspired by a computer programmer personally known to series co-creator Bill Prady. He is named in honor of actor/producer Sheldon Leonard and Nobel Prize Laureate Leon Cooper. Chuck Lorre originally intended Johnny Galecki to play the role, but Galecki thought he would be \"better suited\" for the character of Leonard. Lorre said that when Jim Parsons auditioned for the role, he was \"so startlingly good\" that he was asked to reaudition \"to make sure he hadn't gotten lucky\". Sheldon is one of four characters to appear in every episode of the series, along with Leonard, Howard, and Raj.\n\nSheldon was raised in Galveston, Texas along with his elder brother, George Jr., and fraternal twin sister, Missy, by his mother, Mary Cooper, an overtly devout Baptist; and George Cooper, an alcoholic who was rarely around. Sheldon once got his father fired when he told Mr. Hinckley, a store owner, that George was stealing from the cash register. In \"Young Sheldon\", this is retconned: his father is a football coach who was fired from his coaching position in Galveston because he disclosed that other coaches were illegally recruiting players to their school, forcing the family to return to Medford. He does drink, mostly beer, but is a loving father who is trying to understand his intellectually gifted son. The only member of his family to have actively encouraged his work in science was his grandfather, whom he cherished and affectionately called \"Pop-Pop\", and who died when Sheldon was five years old. Pop-Pop's loss is what caused Sheldon to despise Christmas when his Christmas wish to bring Pop-Pop back didn't come true. Sheldon's closest relative is his maternal grandmother whom he affectionately calls \"Meemaw\", and who in turn calls him \"Moon Pie\". His aunt also encouraged Sheldon by giving him medical equipment, \"in case his work in physics failed, he'd have a 'trade' to fall back on\".\n\nSheldon was interested in science from an early age, and was a child prodigy, although due to his behavioral quirks and his lack of humility about his superior intellect, he was bullied by classmates and neighbors. Sheldon entered college at the age of eleven, and at age fourteen he graduated from college \"summa cum laude\". (To this day, the college he went to for undergraduate studies has yet to be revealed, but he feels it is superior to his fellow \"Big Bang Theory\" colleagues' alma maters of Princeton (Leonard), MIT (Howard) and Harvard (Amy) - however, it is implied in \"The Tam Turbulence\" that Sheldon is a Caltech alumnus.) From then, he worked on his doctorate, was a visiting professor at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, was the youngest person at the time to receive the Stevenson Award, and has appeared on the cover of \"Journal of Physical Chemistry A\". Sheldon is now a theoretical physicist doing research at Caltech, although he stated in \"Young Sheldon\" that he couldn't see himself living in California due to their carefree lifestyle.\n\nSheldon is often described as a stereotypical \"geek\". He is usually characterized as being extremely intelligent, detail-oriented, eccentric, and occasionally disturbing. Despite his intelligence, he often displays childlike qualities, such as extreme stubbornness and a lack of common sense. It is claimed by Bernadette that the reason Sheldon is sometimes unpleasant is because the part of his brain that tells him it is wrong to be nasty is \"getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain\", although, in season 8's \"The Space Probe Disintegration\", Sheldon tearfully admits to Leonard that he \"is\" aware of his peculiarities and how his behavior comes across. The first four episodes of \"The Big Bang Theory\" portray Sheldon slightly inconsistently with respect to his later characterization, in which he is depicted as rather witty and sarcastic, and slightly flirtatious towards Penny in the pilot episode: according to Prady, the character \"began to evolve after episode five or so and became his own thing\".\n\nSheldon possesses an eidetic memory and an IQ of 187, although he claims his IQ cannot be accurately measured by normal tests. He originally claimed to have a master's degree and two doctoral degrees, but this list has increased. Sheldon has an extensive general knowledge in many subjects including physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, cosmology, algebra, calculus, economics, computers, vexillology, engineering, history, geography, linguistics, football, trains, \"Star Trek\" and in addition to being fluent in Klingon, has some knowledge of Finnish, Hindi and Mandarin. He also shows great talent in music, knowing how to play the piano (as does Parsons in real life), the bongos, the recorder, theremin (which Parsons learned to play in real life), showing some skill in Tuvan throat singing and also having perfect pitch. Although his friends have similar intellects to him, his eccentricities, stubbornness, and lack of empathy often frustrate them. Sheldon occasionally uses slang (in a very unnatural fashion), and follows jokes with his catchphrase \"Bazinga!\" which is now an officially registered trademark of Warner Bros. He is uncomfortable with human physical contact and has germophobia, which makes his exceptionally rare hugs extremely awkward and painful-looking. He also has hemophobia. Sheldon has difficulty coping when asked to keep a secret, when he is interrupted, or when he hears arguing. He is also a notary public and uses his knowledge in law and contracts usually for his own advantage and is always distressed when challenged in a legal aspect that he cannot logically defend. In his mannerisms, Sheldon also shows symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Whenever approaching a person's home, he must knock three times, then say the person's name, and must repeat this at least three times (where \"The first one is traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on\"), as a result of him walking in on his father with another woman when he was thirteen. Upon entering a person's home, he must select the proper seat before sitting down. When it is suggested by Penny that he \"just sit anywhere\", his response is \"Oh, no, if only it were that simple!\" This extends to his inability to accept change. His rigidity in maintaining homeostasis often causes him frustration. Because of his rigidity and stubbornness, only his mother and Bernadette – both possessing strong maternal personalities – have shown the ability to order him to do things.\n\nLike his friends, Sheldon is fond of comic books (especially the DC Universe), costumes, video games, roleplaying games, tabletop games, collectible card games, and action figures. Sheldon has restraining orders from his heroes Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan, and Stan Lee, as well as television scientist Bill Nye. Sheldon often wears vintage T-shirts adorned with superhero logos. One of his shirts is emblazoned with the number 73, and in the episode \"The Alien Parasite Hypothesis\" he explains that 73 is the 21st prime number, its mirror, 37, is the 12th prime number and its mirror (21) is the product of multiplying 7 and 3, also in binary, 73 is 1001001, a palindrome. The boys use video games like bowling and archery for \"exercise\" and use the traditional sport rules.\n\nSheldon has sometimes shown empathy, including lending money to Penny without expecting it back quickly (although that may just have been his logical Spock-like response to a problem to be solved; it was, after all, money he was not using and would not miss) and driving her to a hospital when her shoulder was dislocated. Since season 10, his empathy skills have improved to the extent that he goes out of his way to pamper his fiance Amy. Sheldon admits he is overly fond of koalas munching on eucalyptus so much that he has a facial expression that he refers to as his koala face. He dislikes gifts, because the \"social contract\" in his view creates either a debt or burden on the receiver of the gift which will not stop until one of the two involved in the \"gift-relationship\" dies leaving the other either in debt or with an undue surplus. Sheldon also does not take drugs, not even legal ones such as caffeine, due to a promise to his mother, and is hypersensitive when he accidentally consumes them. It has been shown, however, that alcohol often causes Sheldon to loosen up significantly, although it will also cloud his judgment – on occasion, after drinking alcoholic drinks (both deliberately and accidentally), he has done things that he would never do while sober, such as singing out loud, mooning an audience full of people, confronting Wil Wheaton, leaving wildly inappropriate voicemails after \"drunk dialling\" Stephen Hawking, and affectionately slapping Amy's rear.\n\nIn response to criticism from his friends that he is mentally ill, Sheldon often retorts, \"I'm not crazy; my mother had me tested\" – which his mother has confirmed to be true (once while wishing she had gone through with a follow-up examination).\n\nSheldon contrasts strongly with his family, who are neither scientists nor intellectuals. His father George died before the start of \"The Big Bang Theory\", when Sheldon was 14, while his mother Mary is a devout born-again Christian and loving parent. Sheldon has two siblings: a twin sister, Missy, who is a tall, attractive brunette as an adult; and an older brother, George Jr., who owns a tire store chain headquartered in Dallas called Dr. Tire. The adult Sheldon has stated that both Missy and George Jr. beat up Sheldon during their childhoods, and their mother describes them to be \"dumb as soup\". In the pilot episode of \"The Big Bang Theory\", Sheldon tells Leonard that DNA is not a guarantee of an intelligent offspring as he himself is a theoretical physicist and his twin sister is a hostess at Fuddruckers. Sheldon is very fond of his maternal grandmother, whom he calls \"Meemaw\" and who calls him \"Moon Pie\". He called his grandfather, who died when Sheldon was five, \"Pop Pop\". Sheldon was also very close to his grandfather, stating once that his grandfather is the only relative he had who encouraged him to become involved in science.\n\nSheldon has a maternal uncle, Edward, who is called \"Stumpy\" as the result of a time when he cleaned a wood chipper by hand. He also has a maternal aunt, Charlene, which was revealed in \"Young Sheldon\" when his mother told Meemaw that she made dinner for “Charlene and Edward” more times than her. Sheldon had another uncle, named Carl Cooper, who was killed by a badger while cleaning a chimney and another uncle that may have done things to children that were legal in Oklahoma per \"The Clean Room Infiltration\".\n\nIn \"The Engagement Reaction\", Sheldon mentions that his aunt Ruth died a week after being infected by a pathogen she contracted in the hospital where she visited Sheldon's uncle Roger, and that their ashes are now stored in a coffee can on Sheldon's mother’s mantle.\n\nIn the \"Young Sheldon\" episode \"Vanilla Ice Cream, Gentleman Callers, and a Dinette Set\", it is revealed that Sheldon has children in the future.\n\nSheldon's closest friends are Leonard Hofstadter, Howard Wolowitz, and Raj Koothrappali. Of the three, Sheldon is openly dismissive of Howard and constantly opines that a master's degree in engineering demonstrates a lesser intellect than that of the others, who all possess science doctorates. Despite that, Sheldon has referred to Howard as a \"treasured acquaintance\" and later his friend at various points. Sheldon constantly belittles Leonard and dismisses his work, yet at the same time considers Leonard his best friend, as they used to live together and can tolerate each other: in \"The Space Probe Disintegration\", Sheldon admits to Leonard that he is aware of how difficult he can be, and tearfully expresses his gratitude for having Leonard in his life in spite of himself, causing Leonard to break down beside him. Prady stated that \"the fact that, despite everything, Leonard considers Sheldon his best friend reminds us of Sheldon's essential humanity\". Sheldon can only handle having a limited number of friends in his life at a time, but later shows flexibility when he accepts Bernadette and Amy as part of the social group. In season 6, the guys ask if comic book store owner Stuart can be part of the group while Howard is in space.\n\nDespite Penny's neither being a scientist nor sharing many of the group's interests, and having constant fights with Sheldon in the early episodes, they become close friends. While some fans support a romantic relationship between Sheldon and Penny, Lorre has stated his opposition to it by saying: \"We've stumbled into creating a character who has chosen a lifestyle for himself that is unique. And I don't see any reason to modify it.\"\n\nIt has been speculated that Sheldon may be asexual or aromantic. Series co-creator Chuck Lorre said: \"Part of what's wonderful and unique about [Sheldon] is he has chosen not to play in the relationship game either way  – heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, any sexuality.\" This is referenced in \"The Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem\", when Sheldon unknowingly attracts the attention of grad student Ramona Nowitzki, and Penny, seeing this, asks his friends what his \"deal\" (i.e., sexual orientation) is, to which Leonard responds, \"Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption that he has no 'deal'.\"\nIn the season 3 finale, Howard and Raj blackmail Sheldon into meeting Amy Farrah Fowler, with whom they matched him on a dating website. After some obnoxious comments about the dating website, Sheldon finds that Amy agrees with him, and he grows fond of her when she says that \"Any or all physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table\". Their relationship continues in season 4, although Sheldon often points out that they are not in a romantic relationship. The two enjoy intellectual games they create, and Amy and Sheldon openly express the same type of intellectual superiority.\n\nIn season 5, when Leonard inadvertently implies that he and Amy may have had sex after a wedding reception that they both attended, Sheldon unexpectedly reacts violently, karate-chopping Leonard's neck while telling Leonard \"She is not for you... not for you!\" Later, Sheldon formally asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\". During their relationship, Amy begins a campaign to give Sheldon more attention to increase his feelings for her by embracing his interests. As they watch Howard being launched into space in its season finale, Amy is surprised when Sheldon takes her hand for emotional support.\n\nDuring the first half of season 6, in \"The Parking Spot Escalation\" and \"The Fish Guts Displacement\", Sheldon is pushed further after seeing Amy partially exposed and taking care of her while she is ill respectively. In \"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"The Spoiler Alert Segmentation\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during \"The Love Spell Potential\", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.\n\nIn season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling. Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy.\n\nThe ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode \"The Prom Equivalency\", when he finally admits being in love with her: \"I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"The Commitment Determination\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\". Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"The Platonic Permutation\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"The Earworm Reverberation\", Sheldon can't get a song out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"The Opening Night Excitation\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see \"\" without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate. He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the harp with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the second being an all-expense paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's ornithophobia is nothing compared to his ovinaphobia), and the third being the two of them engaging in coitus, at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility, and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently. In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki. In the eleventh season premiere, Amy accepts his proposal, and they marry in the season finale.\n\nHe once idolized fictional prodigy Wesley Crusher from \"\", portrayed by Wil Wheaton, until Wheaton did not show up at a convention attended by Sheldon in 1995. Sheldon had spent 15 hours on a bus travelling to the convention during which time he was forced to break his rule about urinating in a moving vehicle. After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5¼-inch floppy disk). Wheaton was one of Sheldon's mortal enemies, along with his coworkers Barry Kripke and Leslie Winkle. Later, Wheaton managed to patch things up with Sheldon, only to inadvertently pass the enemy list spot to Brent Spiner. Sheldon would later resume his enmity with Wheaton in season 11's \"The Proton Regeneration\" when they compete for the lead role in an Internet reboot of Sheldon's childhood favorite science TV series, \"Professor Proton\", and Wheaton gets the part: however, when he sees how well Wheaton plays the role and on the advice of Howard, he apologizes to him.\n\nParsons' portrayal of Sheldon has received widespread acclaim, and is often cited as the main reason for the program's success by critics and fans alike. James Chamberlin of IGN wrote: \"It's hard to imagine what \"The Big Bang Theory\" would be if it weren't for Jim Parsons' great portrayal of Sheldon Cooper\". Matt Roush of \"TV Guide\" stated that \"there's a spark of divine inspiration in Jim Parsons' uproarious Sheldon Cooper\". Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that: \"Parsons is doing something rare on network TV: making intellectualism admirable, even heroic\".\n\nOn July 16, 2009, Parsons was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. He was nominated again for the same award on July 8, 2010, and eventually won the award on August 29, 2010. On August 1, 2009, he won the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy, with the show itself winning the award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy for season 2. He was nominated again for the same award in 2010 and 2012. Parsons was also nominated for the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor and a Satellite Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2009, 2010, and 2012. On January 16, 2011, Parsons won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy, presented by co-star Kaley Cuoco, for his work on seasons 3 and 4. On June 20, 2011, he won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series at the 1st Critics' Choice Television Awards for his work on season 4, and was nominated again for the same award in 2012. On September 18, 2011, he won his second consecutive Primetime Emmy Award - Lead Actor in Comedy, and was nominated again for the same award on July 19, 2012. In 2013, Parsons was nominated once again for the Golden Globe and received his first nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series. In 2013 & 2014, Parsons was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award - Lead Actor in Comedy for the 5th and 6th time, respectively, both of which he won for his 3rd and 4th Primetime Emmy Awards - Lead Actor in a Comedy Series meaning that Parsons had won this award 4 times in the last 5 years, including back-to-back in 2010/2011and 2013/2014. No actor, in the history of this award has won back-to-back awards on two separate occasions, and his total of 4 awards puts Parsons in a four-way tie at the top with comedy legends Carroll O'Connor, Kelsey Grammer, and Michael J. Fox.\n\nThe asteroid was named after Sheldon. In 2012, a newly discovered species of bee was named \"Euglossa bazinga\", after the character's noted catch phrase, \"Bazinga!\"\n\nIn March 2013, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium named a black-and-white colobus after Sheldon. In 2015, a new echinocaridid phyllocaridan from the Lower Devonian of central-eastern Poland, was named \"Ptychocaris sheldoni\" after Sheldon.\n\nSome viewers have asserted that Sheldon's behavior is consistent with Asperger syndrome. The writers have stated that they did not use Asperger syndrome as a basis for the character, but instead thought of his actions as \"Sheldony\". Series co-creator Bill Prady stated: \"We write the character as the character. A lot of people see various things in him and make the connections. Our feeling is that Sheldon's mother never got a diagnosis, so we don't have one.\" Prady also told Alan Sepinwall of the New Jersey \"Star-Ledger\" that while Sheldon shares traits with people with Asperger's, he was uncomfortable labeling Sheldon as having Asperger's.\n\nIn an interview, Jim Parsons noted the writers' response, but added that, in his opinion, Sheldon \"couldn't display \"more\" traits\" of Asperger's. Parsons, who plays Sheldon, has read John Elder Robison's memoir \"Look Me in the Eye\" about his life with Asperger syndrome, and said that: \"A majority of what I read in that book touched on aspects of Sheldon.\" He also stated that \"the way his brain works, it's so focused on the intellectual topics at hand that thinking he's autistic is an easy leap for people watching the show to make\".\n\nWhen another actor on the series, Mayim Bialik, who plays Amy and has a Ph.D. in Neuroscience, was interviewed by Neil deGrasse Tyson on \"StarTalk\", she said of the theory that Sheldon has Asperger's: \"All of our characters are in theory on the neuropsychiatric spectrum, I would say. Sheldon often gets talked about in terms of Asperger’s or OCD. He has a thing with germs, he has a thing with numbers, he’s got a lot of that precision that we see in OCD. There’s a lot of interesting features to all of our characters that make them technically unconventional socially... And what we’re trying to show with our show is that this is a group of people who likely were teased, mocked, told that they will never be appreciated or loved, and we have a group of people who have successful careers, active social lives (that involve things like Dungeons and Dragons and video games), but they also have relationships, and that’s a fulfilling and satisfying life.”\n"}

The practice was largely the effect of the high mortality rate for young children at the time. A child who survived to 7–10 years was considered worthy of care and was granted adult status and a new adult name during a ritual first haircut.\n\nTraditional names remained dominant with until the Slavic nations converted to Christianity. Finally, the Council of Trent (1545–63) decreed that every Catholic should have a Christian name instead of a native one.\n\nAfter the ban on native non-Christian names imposed by the Council of Trent, the Polish nobility (especially Protestants) attempted to preserve traditional names, such as Zbigniew and Jarosław. Ordinary people, however, tended to choose names solely from the Christian calendar, which contained only a handful of Slavic saints' names, in particular: Kazimierz (St. Casimir), Stanisław (St. Stanislaus), Wacław (St. Wenceslaus) and Władysław (St. Ladislaus). Slavic names that referred to God (e.g., Bogdan, Bogumił) were also permitted.\n\nRus' names were based on common Slavic names such as Volodiměrŭ (\"Володимѣръ\"), Svętopŭlkŭ (\"Свѧтопълкъ\") (holy regiment), Jęropŭlkŭ (\"Ѩропълкъ\"), Voislavŭ (\"Воиславъ\") (glorious warrior), Borislavŭ (\"Бориславъ\") (glorious wrestler), Borisŭ (\"Борисъ\") (fighter), Liubomirŭ (\"Любомиръ\") (loves the world), Ratibor (war fighter), Vadim, Yaroslav, Izyaslav, Mstislav, Vsevolod. In the 11th century, after the growing influence of the Christian Church, the tendency to use the names of saints of the Greek Church has increased and most of old Rus' names were displaced by Dmytriy, Andrey, Nikolay, Terentiy, Sergey, Anton, Kirill, Georgiy, Konstantin, Alexandr, Foma, Akakiy, etc.\n\nSince national revivals during 19th and 20th centuries, traditional names, especially of historical rulers and heroes, regained popularity. For example, in Poland many forgotten names were resurrected, such as Bronisław, Bolesław, Dobiesław, Dobrosław, Jarosław, Mirosław, Przemysław, Radosław, Sławomir, Wiesław, Zdzisław, and Zbigniew; and new ones created, such as Lechosław and Wieńczysław. Today, traditional Slavic names are accepted by the Christian Church and are given at a child's baptism.\n\nOld Slavic names were built with one or two lexemes:\n\nSingle-lexeme names were derived from ordinary or adjectival words and were usually, though not always, borne by peasants, e.g.: Baran (ram), Szydło (awl), Kąkol (cockle), Broda (beard, chin), Żyła (vein), Uchacz (ear-man), Łopata (shovel), Żaba (frog), Rus (Ruthenian/Russian man), Cich (silent man), etc. Many names of this kind are used today, for example:\n\n\nDithematic names are built with two lexemes. Kaleta 1995 notes that \"In the case of Old Germanic and Old Slavic personal names, the dithematic name form contained a wish for the new-born child. These wishes pertained to the values that obtained in these early times\". In Poland alone, over 600 masculine names, 120 feminine names and 150 different affixes (lexemes) are known. These have been reconstructed from place names and the (scarce) written sources such as the Bull of Gniezno. Certain names were reserved for monarchs (e.g. in Poland: Kazimierz, Władysław, Bolesław). Examples are listed below. As an example of the pattern: Władysław contains the prefix \"wład\" (to rule, ruler) and the suffix \"sław\" (fame, glory). Note that feminine equivalents usually end in \"a\" (e.g. Bogusław - Bogusław\"a\").\n\nThese are derived either from the past participle (in the passive voice), e.g.: Bojan, Chocian, Kochan, Miłowan, Pomian, Stator, Wygnan, or the present participle (in the active voice), e.g.: Cieszym, Myślim, Radzim, Borzym. Such names are repositories of perhaps the largest source of sociological data about the ancient Slavic people.\nThey have a variety of purposes, which can be listed as follows:\nOther examples: Poznan ('known', 'recognized'), Goszczon (being a guest at someone's place), Krszczon ('baptized'), Radovan, Dragan, Željan, Dejan, Nayden, Mirjana.\n\nDiminutive and hypocoristic (endearing) names deriving from the above-mentioned dithematic names are created by using different diminutive suffixes. Such names are very popular in everyday usage, and usually are created by replacing part of the name with the suffix \"-ek\" (masculine, predominantly West Slavic; e.g. Polish Włodzi\"mierz\" – Włod\"ek\"), \"-ko\" (masculine, predominantly South Slavic and Ukrainian), \"-ka\" (feminine; also masculine in Russian), or \"-a\": Mila, Luba, Staszek, Radek, Władek, Zlatko, Zlata, Volodya, Bronek, Leszek, Dobrusia, Slavko, Wojtek, Mirka, Bogusia, Slava, Zdravko, Zbyszko, Miłosz, Staś, Przemek, Bolko, Draho, Željko, Borya (fight),Boško, Božica, Božana, Branko, Branka, Braniša, Borko, Budimka, Hvališa, Dobar, Dobra, Dragoš, Dragica, Dragi, Draga, Dragoş, Miloš, Slavko, Slavica, Slavisa, Svetlana, Wít, Zdenka, Bratko, Braco, Braca, Bato, Bata, Batica, etc.\n\nSome Slavic names have gained popularity in other (non-Slavic) countries, e.g.: Vera, Mila, Svante, Boris, Vladimir, Mirko, Laszlo, Casimir, Wenzel, Milena, Estanislao, Vlad, Nadia, Mircea, Bronislovas, Radu, Vesna, Wanda, Ladislao, Bogdan, etc.\n\nThe following list contains only canonized Saints.

{"id": "7249925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7249925", "title": "Steven Novella", "text": "Steven Novella\n\nSteven Paul Novella (born July 29, 1964) is an American clinical neurologist and assistant professor at Yale University School of Medicine. Novella is best known for his involvement in the skeptical movement.\n\nNovella's academic specialization is in neurology, including more specifically, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis and neuromuscular disorders, neurophysiology, and the treatment of hyperactive neurological disorders.\n\nNovella received his medical degree from Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1991, did a year of residency in internal medicine at Georgetown University Hospital/Washington Hospital Center, completed his residency in neurology at Yale–New Haven Hospital in 1995, and was board certified in neurology in 1998.\n\nGrowing up, Novella did not always want to be a physician. In an interview for the \"Books and Ideas\" podcast he said, I think I entertained various career ideas. When I was growing up I thought about being a lawyer for a while and then by the time I went to college, I knew I wanted to go into a science background and I did premed in undergraduate school. So certainly by then I had decided that that’s probably what I wanted to do. So I would probably say in my late teens is when I really decided to go into medicine.\n\nNovella is a proponent of scientific skepticism, which he defines as:\n\n\"... one who prefers beliefs and conclusions that are reliable and valid to ones that are comforting or convenient, and therefore rigorously and openly applies the methods of science and reason to all empirical claims, especially their own. A skeptic provisionally proportions acceptance of any claim to valid logic and a fair and thorough assessment of available evidence, and studies the pitfalls of human reason and the mechanisms of deception so as to avoid being deceived by others or themselves. Skepticism values method over any particular conclusion.\"\nIn response to an editorial in \"The New York Times\" in which Paul Davies concluded \"until science comes up with a testable theory of the laws of the universe, its claim to be free of faith is manifestly bogus,\" Novella said,\n\nIt's not actually true because science is not dependent upon faith in a naturalistic world. It just follows the methods as if it is naturalistic... it is not a system of beliefs. People often ask me and they will ask you as skeptics what do you believe? Well, it's not about belief. Do you believe in ESP? It doesn't matter if I believe in ESP. The only thing that matters is what is the evidence for ESP? ...It's very important I think to present skepticism as a method of inquiry not a set of conclusions, not a set of beliefs.\nIn 1996 Novella, his brother Bob, and Perry DeAngelis founded The Connecticut Skeptical Society.\n\nAs Evan Bernstein tells it, \"One night sometime in late 1995, Perry was over [at] Steve's condo, casually flipping through a copy of SI (Skeptical Inquirer). He was reading through the list of local groups, and commented to Steve: 'There's no local skeptics group in Connecticut. We should start one.'\"\n\nThe group later joined with the Skeptical Inquirers of New England (SINE) and the New Hampshire Skeptical Resource to form the New England Skeptical Society (NESS). Novella currently serves as president of the NESS.\n\nIn the early days of the New England Skeptical Society, Novella participated in investigations of various paranormal claims. Sometimes these were part of the screening process for the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation. Novella investigated such claims as Ouija boards (when the couple claiming they could operate one were properly blindfolded, their powers vanished), the ability to control the flipping of a coin (the claimant turned out to be making some common logical errors in thinking), a mind reader who got zero out of 20 correct, and many dowsers (typically found to be experiencing the Ideomotor phenomenon). Novella and the NESS also examined some phenomena described by people who were not competing for the One Million Dollar prize, such as haunted houses, the ability to communicate with the dead, and recording the voices of ghosts, known as electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.\n\nIn May 2005, Novella started \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" (SGU) podcast with his friends Perry DeAngelis and Evan Bernstein, and his brothers Bob and Jay. DeAngelis remained with the show until his death in August, 2007. In July 2006, Rebecca Watson joined the podcast as a regular, staying through December, 2014. Cara Santa Maria joined the cast in July, 2015. \n\nNovella both hosts the show and does the editing and post-production. In an interview for the \"Books and Ideas\" podcast he said, I am ultimately responsible for the content and prepping it and I do all the post production which I know, as you know is a lot of work. So you know, it's a good 20, 30 hours a week that I put into putting out this podcast, it is almost like having a second job. And, you know, it’s a labor of love.\n\nWhen asked about the purpose of the podcast Novella said, We deal primarily with controversial topics or topics on the fringe of science, although sometimes we do just straight up really interesting science news stories, whatever captures our interest. But we deal with the paranormal or conspiracy theories, or health fraud, consumer protection type of issues. And our goal is to give our listeners the tools to look at science in the news, science in society and have some way of navigating through all of the claims and all of the hype and basically have the tools to figure things out for themselves more than anything else.\nIn 2007, Novella started a blog, \"Neurologica\", \"your daily fix of neuroscience, skepticism and critical thinking\", for which he writes three articles per week on a wide range of subjects generally related to science or skepticism. He is the executive editor of the blog \"Science-Based Medicine\" for which he is also a regular contributor, and he is a medical advisor to Quackwatch.\n\nIn 2008, Novella was one of the first 200 to sign the Project Steve petition, a tongue-in-cheek parody of the list of \"scientists that doubt evolution\" produced by creationists.\n\nNovella is the editor of a series of e-books composed of articles collected from the \"Science-Based Medicine\" blog. Each book focuses mainly on one topic such as critical thinking, herbs, supplements and nutrition, chiropractic, vaccines, homeopathy, etc.\n\nNovella is an associate editor of the \"Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine\", and writes the monthly \"Weird Science\" column for the New Haven Advocate newspaper. Novella is also author to several Dungeons and Dragons campaign and expansion packs.\n\nNovella has appeared on several television programs, including \"\", \"The Dr. Oz Show\", and \"Inside Edition\".\n\nIn 2008, he filmed a pilot for a television series called The Skeptologists along with Brian Dunning, Yau-Man Chan, Mark Edward, Michael Shermer, Phil Plait, and Kirsten Sanford. The series has not been picked up by any network.\n\nNovella appeared on \"The Dr. Oz Show\" segment, \"Controversial Medicine: Why your doctor is afraid of alternative health\", where he was introduced as \"an outspoken critic of alternative medicine.\" Novella noted that the term \"alternative\" creates a double-standard. \"There should be one science-based common-sense standard to figure out what therapies work and are safe.\" Novella made the point that herbs are medicinals and have been used that way for thousands of years, but the problem is in re-branding them as alternative, marketing them as natural, and therefore arguing that they don't need evidence that they are safe and effective. \"At the end of the day, the public was sold products that the evidence shows doesn't work.\"\n\nOn the subject of acupuncture, Novella stated, \"I've spent a lot of time reviewing the acupuncture literature ... and the evidence overwhelmingly shows that acupuncture, in fact, doesn't work.\" In response to Dr. Oz's complaint that Novella is dismissive of an idea that the \"way we think [about acupuncture] in the west is that it can't be possible effective.\" Novella replied, \"I didn't say it couldn't possibly work, I said when you look at it, it doesn't work.\"\n\nIn late 2017, Novella and his brothers began producing a science-fiction review show, \"Alpha Quadrant Six\", which is archived on Facebook and YouTube. In the initial installments, the first season of the CBS All Access TV series \"\" was reviewed each week by live streaming the review show over FaceBook immediately following each original episode's release.\n\nNovella was the first scientist to publish and publicize an opinion and reflective evaluation of the phenomenon known as Autonomous sensory meridian response, a low grade euphoria characterized by 'a combination of positive feelings, relaxation, and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin', which typically begins 'on the scalp' before moving 'down the spine' to the base of the neck, sometimes spreading 'to the back, arms and legs as intensity increases', most commonly triggered by specific acoustic and visual stimuli including the content of some digital videos, and less commonly by intentional attentional control.\n\nIn a post on his blog \"Neurologica\", Novella says that he always starts his investigations of such phenomena by asking whether or not 'it is real'. Regarding ASMR, Novella says 'in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described' it with 'fairly specific details. In this way'…ASMR is similar to migraine headaches - we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history.' Novella tentatively posits the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure, or another way to activate the 'pleasure response'. However, Novella draws attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that functional magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.\n\nNovella has created two courses for The Great Courses, \"Medical Myths, Lies, and Half-Truths: What We Think We Know May Be Hurting Us\" and \"Your Deceptive Mind: A Scientific Guide to Critical Thinking Skills\".\n\nIn 2009, Novella was the board chairman when the Institute for Science in Medicine was founded.\n\nIn January 2010, Novella was elected as a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n\nIn 2011, Novella was appointed Senior Fellow of the James Randi Educational Foundation, and Director of their Science-Based medicine project.\n\nOn June 9, 2014, Edward Tobinick filed a civil action in Florida Southern District Court naming Novella, Yale University, Society for Science-Based Medicine, Inc. and SGU Productions, LLC as defendants. The main allegations of the action are that \"in violation of the Lanham Act, Novella has and continues to publish a false advertisement disparaging Plaintiffs entitled 'Enbrel for Stroke and Alzheimer's', ('the 'Advertisement') and implying that the INR plaintiffs' use of etanercept is ineffective and useless;\" and \"The Advertisement is extremely inflammatory and defamatory in nature as it contains multiple false and misleading statements of fact regarding Plaintiffs.\" \"The Advertisement\" referred to in the action is an entry for the \"Science-Based Medicine\" blog that Novella wrote and posted on May 8, 2013.\n\nOn July 14, 2014, Novella's attorney, Marc Randazza, filed an \"Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary and Preliminary Injunctive Relief.\" The filing states that Tobinick is \"highly unlikely to prevail in this matter . . . as Defendant's statements range from provably true to opinion,\" that a preliminary injunction \"would impose an unlawful prior restraint of speech,\" and that \"an injunction would result in far more harm to Defendants and the public than Plaintiffs' claimed injury.\" Novella posted a response to the lawsuit on \"Science-Based Medicine\" in which he said, \"In my opinion he [Tobinick] is using legal thuggery in an attempt to intimidate me and silence my free speech because he finds its content inconvenient\".\n\nUnited States District Judge Robin Rosenberg ordered the case closed on September 30, 2015, and found in judgement for Novella. Tobinick was unable to show that Novella had profited from his blog post or that it was in any way an advertisement. \"... It is hereby ORDERED and ADJUDGED that defendant Dr. Steven Novella ... is GRANTED. All pending motions are DENIED AS MOOT, all deadlines are TERMINATED, and the Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE THE CASE. In 2017, a final appeal affirmed the district court's opinion.\n\nNovella, along with some friends, owned a local live action role-playing (LARP) game for about 5 years. It was during this time that they wrote seven d20 books.\n\nNovella has coauthored several adventure gaming books including \"Twin Crowns\", a naval and travel expansion for \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"Broadsides!\", a role-playing game (RPG) based on the d20 system. Novella also coauthored \"Spellbound: A Codex of Ritual Magic\", which features \"a complete system of magic suitable for any campaign setting\" using the d20 system.\n\n\nNovella often writes and speaks about a variety of topics in areas of alternative medicine, the new age movement, parapsychology, and pseudoscience. As a proponent of scientific skepticism, his writings generally address supporting evidence and scientific consensus. Topics addressed in his writings include:\n\n\n\nA book written by Steve Novella and his \"Skeptics' Guide\" co-hosts about scientific skepticism was published in October 2018. \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe: How to Know What's Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake\" was reviewed by Publishers Weekly, which said: \"In plain English and cogent prose, Novella makes skepticism seem mighty, necessary, and accessible all at once... Empowering and illuminating, this thinker’s paradise is an antidote to spreading anti-scientific sentiments. Readers will return to its ideas again and again.\" Neil deGrasse Tyson's review says: \"Thorough, informative, and enlightening, \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" inoculates you against the frailties and shortcomings of human cognition. If this book does not become required reading for us all, we may well see modern civilization unravel before our eyes.\"\n\n"}

He was the son of Rev. Humphrey Babington, the great-great-grandson of Brutus Babington (sent to Ireland by James VI and I), and his wife Anne (née Buttle). Apprenticed to a practitioner at Londonderry, and afterwards completed his medical education at Guy's Hospital, London, but without at that time taking a medical degree. In 1777 he was made assistant surgeon to Haslar (Naval) Hospital, and held this appointment for four years. He then obtained the position of apothecary to Guy's Hospital, and also lectured on chemistry in the medical school. He resigned the post of apothecary, and, having obtained the necessary degree of MD from the University of Aberdeen in 1795. in 1796 he joined Dr William Saunders at Guy's Hospital in London as his assistant and in 1802/3 (at Saunder's recommendation) replaced Saunders as head Physician.\n\nBabington was physician to Guy's Hospital from 1795 to 1811.

{"id": "33436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33436", "title": "William Lyon Mackenzie King", "text": "William Lyon Mackenzie King\n\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874 – July 22, 1950), also commonly known as Mackenzie King, was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada in 1921–1926, 1926–1930 and 1935–1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (1939–1945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \"Help those that cannot help themselves\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state.\n\nKing acceded to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1919. Taking the helm of a party bitterly torn apart during the First World War, he reconciled factions, unifying the Liberal Party and leading it to victory in the 1921 election. His party was out of office during the harshest days of the Great Depression in Canada, 1930–35; he returned when the economy was on an upswing. He personally handled complex relations with the Prairie Provinces, while his top aides Ernest Lapointe and Louis St. Laurent skillfully met the demands of French Canadians. During the Second World War, he carefully avoided the battles over conscription, patriotism and ethnicity that had divided Canada so deeply in the First World War. Though few major policy innovations took place during his premiership, he was able to synthesize and pass a number of measures that had reached a level of broad national support. Scholars attribute King's long tenure as party leader to his wide range of skills that were appropriate to Canada's needs. He understood the workings of capital and labour. Keenly sensitive to the nuances of public policy, he was a workaholic with a shrewd and penetrating intelligence and a profound understanding of the complexities of Canadian society. A modernizing technocrat who regarded managerial mediation as essential to an industrial society, he wanted his Liberal Party to represent liberal corporatism to create social harmony. King worked to bring compromise and harmony to many competing and feuding elements, using politics and government action as his instrument. He led his party for 29 years, and established Canada's international reputation as a middle power fully committed to world order.\n\nKing's biographers agree on the personal characteristics that made him distinctive. He lacked the charisma of such contemporaries as Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, or Charles de Gaulle. He lacked a commanding presence or oratorical skill; his best writing was academic, and did not resonate with the electorate. Cold and tactless in human relations, he had many political allies but very few close personal friends. He never married and lacked a hostess whose charm could substitute for his chill. He kept secret his beliefs in spiritualism and use of mediums to stay in contact with departed associates and particularly with his mother, and allowed his intense spirituality to distort his understanding of Adolf Hitler throughout the late 1930s.\n\nA survey of scholars in 1997 by \"Maclean's\" magazine ranked King first among all Canada's prime ministers, ahead of Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. As historian Jack Granatstein notes, \"the scholars expressed little admiration for King the man but offered unbounded admiration for his political skills and attention to Canadian unity.\" On the other hand, political scientist Ian Stewart in 2007 found that even Liberal activists have but a dim memory of him.\n\nKing was born in Berlin, Ontario (now known as Kitchener), to John King and Isabella Grace Mackenzie. His maternal grandfather was William Lyon Mackenzie, first mayor of Toronto and leader of the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837. His father was a lawyer, and later a professor at Osgoode Hall Law School. King had three siblings. He attended Berlin Central School (now Suddaby Public School) and Berlin High School (now Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School). Tutors were hired to teach him more politics, science, math, English and French.\n\nHis father was a lawyer with a struggling practice in a small city, and never enjoyed financial security. His parents lived a life of shabby gentility, employing servants and tutors they could scarcely afford, although their financial situation improved somewhat following a move to Toronto around 1890, where King lived with them for several years in a duplex located on Beverley Street while studying at the University of Toronto.\n\nKing became a lifelong practising Presbyterian with a dedication to applying Christian virtues to social issues in the style of the Social Gospel. He never favoured socialism.\n\nKing earned five university degrees. He obtained three degrees from the University of Toronto: B.A. 1895, LL.B. 1896 and M.A. 1897; he earned his LL.B. in 1896 from Osgoode Hall Law School. While studying in Toronto he met a wide circle of friends, many of whom became prominent. He was an early member and officer of the Kappa Alpha Society, which included a number of these individuals (two future Ontario Supreme Court Justices and the future Chairman of the University itself). It encouraged debate on political ideas. He also met Arthur Meighen, a future political rival; the two men did not get on especially well from the start.\n\nKing was especially concerned with issues of social welfare and was influenced by the settlement house movement pioneered by Toynbee Hall in London, England. He played a central role in fomenting a students' strike at the university in 1895. He was in close touch, behind the scenes, with Vice-Chancellor William Mulock, for whom the strike provided a chance to embarrass his rivals Chancellor Edward Blake and President James Loudon. King failed to gain his immediate objective, a teaching position at the University, but earned political credit with Mulock, the man who would invite him to Ottawa and make him a deputy minister only five years later. While studying at the University of Toronto, King also contributed to the campus newspaper \"The Varsity\".\n\nAfter studying at the University of Chicago and working with Jane Addams at her settlement house, Hull House, King proceeded to Harvard University. He earned an M.A. in political economy from Harvard in 1898. In 1909, Harvard granted him a PhD for a dissertation on \"Oriental Immigration to Canada\". It was a report he had written while he was Deputy-Minister of Labour in 1908. In it he argued against the immigration of Asians, saying:\nHe is the only Canadian Prime Minister to have earned a PhD.\n\nKing was appointed in 1900 as Deputy Minister at the head of the Canadian government's new department of Labour, and became active in policy domains from Japanese immigration to railways, notably the Industrial Disputes Investigations Act (1907) which sought to avert labour strikes by prior conciliation.\nIn 1901, King's roommate and best friend, Henry Albert Harper, died heroically during a skating party when a young woman fell through the ice of the partly frozen Ottawa River. Harper dove into the water to try to save her, and perished in the attempt. King led the effort to raise a memorial to Harper, which resulted in the erection of the Sir Galahad statue on Parliament Hill in 1905. In 1906, King published a memoir of Harper, entitled \"The Secret of Heroism\".\n\nHe was first elected to Parliament as a Liberal in a 1908 by-election, and then in 1909 was appointed as the first-ever Minister of Labour.\n\nKing's term as Minister of Labour was marked by two significant achievements. He led the passage of the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act and the Combines Investigation Act, which he had shaped during his civil and parliamentary service. The legislation significantly improved the financial situation for millions of Canadian workers. He lost his seat in the 1911 general election, which saw the Conservatives defeat his Liberals.\n\nAfter his defeat, King went on the lecture circuit on behalf of the Liberal Party. In June 1914 John D. Rockefeller Jr. hired him at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York City, to head its new Department of Industrial Research. It paid $12,000 per year, compared to the meagre $2,500 per year the Liberal Party was paying. He worked for the Foundation until 1918, forming a close working association and friendship with Rockefeller, advising him through the turbulent period of the 1914 strike and Ludlow massacre at a family-owned coal company in Colorado, which subsequently set the stage for a new era in labour management in America. King became one of the earliest expert practitioners in the emerging field of industrial relations.\nKing was not a pacifist, but he showed little enthusiasm for the Great War; he faced criticism for not serving in Canada's military and instead working for the Rockefellers. But he was nearly 40 years old when the war began, and was not in good physical condition. He never gave up his Ottawa home, and travelled to the United States on an as-needed basis, performing valuable service by helping to keep war-related industries running smoothly.\n\nIn 1918 King, assisted by his friend F. A. McGregor, published the far-sighted book \"Industry and Humanity: A Study in the Principles Underlying Industrial Reconstruction\", a dense, abstract work he wrote in response to the Ludlow massacre. It went over the heads of most readers, but revealed the practical idealism behind King's political thinking. He emphasized that capital and labour were natural allies, not foes, and that the community at large (represented by the government) should be the third and decisive party in industrial disputes. He expressed derision for syndicates and trades unions, chastising them for aiming at the \"destruction by force of existing organization, and the transfer of industrial capital from the present possessors\" to themselves.\n\nQuitting the Rockefeller Foundation in February 1918, King became an independent consultant on labour issues for the next two years, earning $1,000 per week from leading American corporations. Even so, he kept his official residence in Ottawa, hoping for a call to duty.\n\nIn 1917, Canada was in crisis; King supported Liberal leader Sir Wilfrid Laurier in his opposition to conscription, which was violently opposed in the province of Quebec. The Liberal party became deeply split, with most Anglophones joining in the pro-conscription Union government, a coalition controlled by the Conservatives under Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden. King returned to Canada to run in the 1917 election, which focused almost entirely on the conscription issue. Unable to overcome a landslide against Laurier, King lost in the constituency of North York, which his grandfather had once represented.\n\nKing was Laurier's chosen successor as leader of the Liberal Party, but it was deeply divided by Quebec's total opposition to conscription and the agrarian revolt in Ontario and the Prairies. Levin argues that when King returned to politics in 1919, he was a rusty outsider with a weak base facing a nation bitterly split by language, regionalism and class. He outmaneuvered more senior competitors by embracing Laurier's legacy, championing labour interests, calling for welfare reform, and offering solid opposition to the Conservative enemy. When Laurier died in 1919, King was elected leader in the first Liberal leadership convention, defeating his four rivals on the fourth ballot. He won thanks to the support of the Quebec bloc, organized by his long-time lieutenant in Quebec, Ernest Lapointe (1876–1941). King could not speak French and had minimal interest in Quebec, but in election after election for the next 20 years (save for 1930), Lapointe produced the critical seats to give the Liberals control of the Commons. He was almost co-Prime Minister with King until his death in 1941.\n\nOnce he became the Liberal leader in 1919 he paid closer attention to the Prairies, a fast-developing region. With a highly romanticized view he envisioned the pioneers as morally sound, hardworking individuals who lived close to nature and to God. The reform ferment in the region meshed with his self-image as a social reformer and fighter for the \"people\" against the \"interests\". Viewing a glorious sunrise in Alberta in 1920, he wrote in his diary, \"I thought of the New Day, the New Social Order. It seems like Heaven's prophecy of the dawn of a new era, revealed to me.\" Pragmatism played a role as well, since his party depended for its survival on the votes of Progressive Party members of parliament who represented farmers in Ontario and the Prairies. He convinced many Progressives to return to the Liberal fold.\n\nIn the 1921 election, his party defeated Arthur Meighen and the Conservatives, and he became Prime Minister. King's Liberals originally had a bare majority position, however, since they had won 118 out of 235 seats, exactly the minimum for a majority. The Conservatives won 49, the newly formed Progressive Party won 58 (but declined to form the official Opposition), and the remaining ten seats went to fringe parties and Independents; most of these ten supported the Progressives.\n\nAs Prime Minister of Canada, King was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 20 June 1922 and was sworn at Buckingham Palace on 11 October 1923, during the 1923 Imperial Conference.\n\nDuring his first term of office, from 1921 to 1926, King pursued a conservative domestic policy with the object of lowering wartime taxes and, especially, wartime ethnic and labour tensions. \"The War is over\", he argued, \"and for a long time to come it is going to take all that the energies of man can do to bridge the chasm and heal the wounds which the War has made in our social life.\" He sought a Canadian voice independent of London in foreign affairs. In September 1922 the British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, appealed repeatedly to King for Canadian support in the Chanak crisis, in which a war threatened between Britain and Turkey. King coldly replied that the Canadian Parliament would decide what policy to follow, making clear it would not be bound by London's suggestions; the crisis soon dissipated, but the episode led to the downfall of Lloyd George.\n\nDespite prolonged negotiations, King was unable to attract the Progressives into his government, but once Parliament opened, he relied on their support to defeat non-confidence motions from the Conservatives. King was opposed in some policies by the Progressives, who opposed the high tariffs of the National Policy. King faced a delicate balancing act of reducing tariffs enough to please the Prairie-based Progressives, but not too much to alienate his vital support in industrial Ontario and Quebec, who perceived tariffs were necessary to compete with American imports. King and Conservative leader Arthur Meighen sparred bitterly in Commons debates, and the decades-long rivalry between the two was among the nastiest in the history of Canadian politics. Despite their university-days acquaintance, their personalities and working methods contrasted enormously in almost every respect.\n\nAs King's term wore on, the Progressives gradually weakened. Their effective and passionate leader, Thomas Crerar, resigned to return to his grain business, and was replaced by the more placid Robert Forke. Socialist reformer J. S. Woodsworth gradually gained influence and power, and King was able to reach an accommodation with him on policy matters. In any event, the Progressive caucus lacked the party discipline that was traditionally enforced by the Liberals and Conservatives. The Progressives had campaigned on a promise that their MP's would represent their constituents first. King used this to his advantage, as he could always count on at least a handful of Progressive MP's to shore up his near-majority position for any crucial vote.\n\nKing had a long-standing concern with city planning and the development of the national capital, since he had been trained in the settlement house movement and envisioned town planning and garden cities as a component of his broader program of social reform. He drew on four broad traditions in early North American planning: social planning, the Parks Movement, the City Scientific, and the City Beautiful. King's greatest impact was as the political champion for the planning and development of Ottawa, Canada's national capital. His plans, much of which were completed in the two decades after his death, were part of a century of federal planning that repositioned Ottawa as a national space in the City Beautiful style. Confederation Square, for example, was initially planned to be a civic plaza to balance the nearby federal presence of Parliament Hill. The Great War monument was not installed until the 1939 royal visit, and King intended that the replanning of the capital would be the World War I memorial. However, the symbolic meaning of the World War I monument gradually expanded to become the place of remembrance for all Canadian war sacrifices.\n\nKing called an election in 1925, in which the Conservatives won the most seats, but not a majority in the House of Commons. King held onto power with the support of the Progressives. A corruption scandal discovered late in his first term involved misdeeds around the expansion of the Beauharnois Canal in Quebec; this led to extensive inquiries and eventually a Royal Commission, which exposed the Beauharnois Scandal. The resulting press coverage damaged King's party in the election. Early in his second term, another corruption scandal, this time in the Department of Customs, was revealed, which led to more support for the Conservatives and Progressives, and the possibility that King would be forced to resign, if he lost sufficient support in the Commons. King had no personal connection to this scandal, although one of his own appointees was at the heart of it. Opposition leader Meighen unleashed his fierce invective towards King, stating he was hanging onto power \"like a lobster with lockjaw\".`\n\nIn 1926 King, facing a House of Commons vote connected to the customs scandal that could force his government to resign, advised the Governor General, Lord Byng, to dissolve Parliament and call another election, but Byng refused, the only time in Canadian history that the Governor General has exercised such a power. Instead Byng called upon Conservative Party leader Arthur Meighen to form a government. Meighen attempted to do so, but was unable to obtain a majority in the Commons and he, too, advised dissolution, which this time was accepted. The episode marks a constitutional crisis that was resolved by a tradition of non-interference in Canadian political affairs on the part of the British government.\n\nIn the ensuing Canadian federal election, 1926, King appealed for public support of the constitutional principle that the Governor General must accept the advice of his ministers, though this principle was at most only customary. The Liberals argued that the Governor General had interfered in politics and shown favour to one party over another. King and his party won the election with a plurality of seats in the Commons: 116 seats to the Conservatives' 91 in a 245-member House.\n\nThe constitutional crisis of 1926 provoked a consideration of the constitutional relations between the self-governing dominions and the British government. During the next five years the position of the Governor General of a Dominion was clarified; he ceased to be a representative of the British government and became a representative of The Crown. The independent position of the Dominions in the British Empire (later the Commonwealth) and in the international community was put on a firm foundation by the Balfour Declaration of 1926, subsequently codified in the Statute of Westminster (1931).\n\nKing expanded the Department of External Affairs, founded in 1909, to further promote Canadian autonomy from Britain. The new department took some time to develop, but over time it significantly increased the reach and projection of Canadian diplomacy. Prior to this, Canada had relied on British diplomats who owed their first loyalty to London. King recruited many high-calibre people for the new venture, including future prime minister Lester Pearson and influential career administrators Norman Robertson and Hume Wrong. This project was a key element of his overall strategy, setting Canada on a course independent of Britain, of former colonizer France, as well as of the neighbouring powerful United States.\n\nIn domestic affairs King strengthened the Liberal policy of increasing the powers of the provincial governments by transferring to the governments of Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan the ownership of the crown lands within those provinces, as well as the subsoil rights; these in particular would become increasingly important, as petroleum and other natural resources proved very abundant. In collaboration with the provincial governments, he inaugurated a system of old-age pensions based on need. In February 1930, he appointed Cairine Wilson as the first female senator in Canadian history.\n\nHis government was in power during the beginning of the Great Depression, but was slow to respond to the mounting crisis. He felt that the crisis was a temporary swing of the business cycle and that the economy would soon recover without government intervention. Critics said he was out of touch. Just prior to the election, King carelessly remarked that he \"would not give a five-cent piece\" to Tory provincial governments for unemployment relief. The opposition made this remark a catch-phrase; the main issue was the deterioration in the economy and whether the prime minister was out of touch with the hardships of ordinary people. The Liberals lost the election of 1930 to the Conservative Party, led by Richard Bedford Bennett. The popular vote was very close between the two parties, with the Liberals actually earning more votes than in 1926, but the Conservatives had a geographical advantage that turned into enough seats to give a majority.\n\nAfter his loss, King stayed on as Opposition Leader, where it was his policy to refrain from offering advice or alternative policies. Indeed, his policy preferences were not much different from Bennett's, and he let the Conservative government have its way. Though he gave the impression of sympathy with progressive and liberal causes, he had no enthusiasm for the New Deal of American President Franklin D. Roosevelt (which Bennett eventually tried to emulate, after floundering without solutions for several years), and he never advocated massive government action to alleviate depression in Canada. Upon his return to office in October 1935, however, King seemed to demonstrate a commitment (like Franklin Roosevelt) to the underprivileged, speaking of a new era where \"poverty and adversity, want and misery are the enemies which Liberalism will seek to banish from the land\".\n\nIn the 1935 election the Liberals used the slogan \"King or Chaos\" to win a landslide victory. For the first time in his political career, King led an undisputed Liberal majority government. Promising a much-desired trade treaty with the U.S., the King government passed the 1935 Reciprocal Trade Agreement. It marked the turning point in Canadian-American economic relations, reversing the disastrous trade war of 1930–31, lowering tariffs, and yielding a dramatic increase in trade. More subtly, it revealed to the prime minister and President Roosevelt that they could work together well.\n\nThe worst of the Depression had passed by 1935 when King regained power. He implemented relief programs such as the National Housing Act and National Employment Commission. His government also made the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation a crown corporation in 1936, created Trans-Canada Airlines (the precursor to Air Canada) in 1937, and formed the National Film Board of Canada in 1939. In 1938, he transformed the Bank of Canada from a private entity to a crown corporation.\n\nAfter 1936 the prime minister lost patience when western Canadians preferred radical alternatives such as the CCF (Co-operative Commonwealth Federation) and Social Credit to his middle-of-the-road liberalism. Indeed, he came close to writing off the region with his comment that the prairie dust bowl was \"part of the U.S. desert area. I doubt if it will be of any real use again.\" Instead he paid more attention to the industrial regions and the needs of Ontario and Quebec, particularly with respect to the proposed St. Lawrence Seaway project with the United States. As for the unemployed, he was hostile to federal relief, and only reluctantly accepted a Keynesian solution that involved federal deficit spending, tax cuts and subsidies to the housing market.\n\nOver the next fourteen years, a wide range of reforms similar to those association with the New Deal were realized during Mackenzie King's last period in office as Prime Minister. In 1939, compulsory contributions for pensions for low-income widows and orphans were introduced (although these only covered the regularly employed) while depressed farmers were subsidized from that same year onwards. In 1944, family allowances were introduced, and from 1948 the federal government subsidized medical services in the provinces. The various provinces were assisted by the Federal Unemployment and Agricultural Assistance Act of 1938 and the Youth Training Act of 1939 to create training programs for young persons, while an amendment to the Criminal Code (which received Royal assent in May 1939) provided against refusal to hire, or dismissal, \"solely because of a person's membership in a lawful trade-union or association\". In 1937, the age for blind persons to qualify for old-age pensions was reduced to 40 in 1937, and later to 21 in 1947.\n\nThe Federal Home Improvement Plan of 1937 provided subsidized rates of interest on rehabilitation loans to 66,900 homes, while the National Housing Act of 1938 made provision for the building of low-rent housing. Another Housing Act was later passed in 1944 with the intention of providing federally guaranteed loans or mortgages to individuals who wished to repair or construct dwellings through their own initiative. The Vocational Training Co-ordination Act of 1942 provided an impetus to the provinces to set up facilities for postsecondary vocational training, and in 1948 the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act was passed, which safeguarded the rights of workers to join unions while requiring employers to recognize unions chosen by their employees.\nIn March 1936, in response to the German remilitarization of the Rhineland, King had the Canadian High Commissioner in London inform the British government that if Britain went to war with Germany over the Rhineland issue, Canada would remain neutral. In June 1937, during an Imperial Conference of all the Dominion Prime Ministers in London, King informed British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain that Canada would only go to war if Britain were directly attacked, and that if Britain were to become involved in a continental war then Chamberlain was not to expect Canadian support.\n\nIn 1937, King visited Germany and met with Adolf Hitler. Possessing a religious yearning for direct insight into the hidden mysteries of life and the universe, and strongly influenced by the operas of Richard Wagner (who was also Hitler's favourite composer), King decided Hitler was akin to mythical Wagnerian heroes within whom good and evil were struggling. He thought that good would eventually triumph and Hitler would redeem his people and lead them to a harmonious, uplifting future. These spiritual attitudes not only guided Canada's relations with Hitler but gave the prime minister the comforting sense of a higher mission, that of helping to lead Hitler to peace. King commented in his journal that \"he is really one who truly loves his fellow-men, and his country, and would make any sacrifice for their good\". He forecast that \"the world will yet come to see a very great man–mystic in Hitler ... I cannot abide in Nazism – the regimentation – cruelty – oppression of Jews – attitude towards religion, etc., but Hitler ... will rank some day with Joan of Arc among the deliverers of his people.\"\n\nIn late 1938, during the great crisis in Europe over Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Munich Agreement, Canadians were divided. Francophones insisted on neutrality, as did some top advisers like Oscar D. Skelton. Imperialists stood behind Britain and were willing to fight Germany. King, who served as his own secretary of state for external affairs (foreign minister), said privately that if he had to choose he would not be neutral, but he made no public statement. All of Canada was relieved that the British appeasement at Munich, while sacrificing the rights of Czechoslovakia, seemed to bring peace.\n\nWhile Deputy Minister of Labour, King was appointed to investigate the causes of and claims for compensation resulting from the 1907 Asiatic Exclusion League riots in Vancouver's Chinatown and Japantown. One of the claims for damages came from Chinese opium dealers, which led King to investigate narcotics use in Vancouver, British Columbia. Following the investigation King reported that white women were also opium users, not just Chinese men, and the federal government used the report to justify the first legislation outlawing narcotics in Canada. The report failed to include any reference regarding the Opium Wars, the involvement of the East Indian Trading company, or the official Chinese government's resistance to the opium trade which was renewed on September 20, 1906.\n\nUnder King's administration, the Canadian government, responding to strong public opinion, especially in Quebec, refused to expand immigration opportunities for Jewish refugees from Europe. In June 1939 Canada, along with Cuba and the United States, refused to allow entry for the 900 Jewish refugees aboard the passenger ship .\n\nKing realized the likelihood of World War II and began mobilizing on August 25, 1939, with full mobilization on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland. In 1914, Canada was at the war by virtue of King George V's declaration. In 1939, the Prime Minister asserted Canada's autonomy and convened the House of Commons on September 7, nearly a month ahead of schedule, to discuss the government's intention to enter the war, which was approved two days later. On September 10, Prime Minister King, through his High Commissioner in London, issued a request to King George VI, asking him, in his capacity as King of Canada, to declare war against Germany.\n\nKing linked Canada more and more closely to the United States, signing an agreement with Roosevelt at Ogdensburg, New York in August 1940 that provided for the close cooperation of Canadian and American forces, despite the fact that the U.S. remained officially neutral until the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. During the war the Americans took virtual control of the Yukon and the then-British colony of Newfoundland in building the Alaska Highway and major airbases.\n\nKing—and Canada—were largely ignored by Winston Churchill, despite Canada's major role in supplying food, raw materials, munitions and money to the hard-pressed British economy, training airmen for the Commonwealth, guarding the western half of the North Atlantic Ocean against German U-boats, and providing combat troops for the invasions of Italy, France and Germany in 1943–45. King proved highly successful in mobilizing the economy for war, with impressive results in industrial and agricultural output. The depression ended, prosperity returned, and Canada's economy expanded significantly. On the political side, King rejected any notion of a government of national unity. He held the Canadian federal election, 1940 as normally scheduled, despite the ongoing World War, unlike Britain, which formed a government of national unity and did not hold a wartime election.\n\nTo re-arm Canada he built the Royal Canadian Air Force as a viable military power, while at the same time keeping it separate from Britain's Royal Air Force. He was instrumental in obtaining the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan Agreement, which was signed in Ottawa in December 1939, binding Canada, Britain, New Zealand and Australia to a program that eventually trained half the airmen from those four nations in the Second World War.\n\nKing's government greatly expanded the role of the National Research Council of Canada during the war, moving into full-scale research in nuclear physics and commercial use of nuclear power in the following years. King, with C. D. Howe acting as point man, moved the nuclear group from Montreal to Chalk River, Ontario in 1944, with the establishment of Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories and the residential town of Deep River, Ontario. Canada became a world leader in this field, with the NRX reactor becoming operational in 1947; at the time, NRX was the only operational nuclear reactor outside the United States.\nThe NRC also contributed to wartime scientific development in other ways during this period.\n\nKing's promise not to impose conscription contributed to the defeat of Maurice Duplessis's Union Nationale Quebec provincial government in 1939 and the Liberals' re-election in the 1940 election. But after the fall of France in 1940, Canada introduced conscription for home service. Still, only volunteers were to be sent overseas. King wanted to avoid a repeat of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. By 1942, the military was pressing King hard to send conscripts to Europe. In 1942, King held a national plebiscite on the issue, asking the nation to relieve him of the commitment he had made during the election campaign. In the House of Commons on June 10, 1942, he said that his policy was \"not necessarily conscription but conscription if necessary\".\n\nFrench Canadians voted against conscription, with over 70% opposed, but an overwhelming majority – over 80% – of English Canadians supported it. French and English conscripts were sent to fight in the Aleutian Islands in 1943 – technically North American soil and therefore not \"overseas\" – but the mix of Canadian volunteers and draftees found that the Japanese troops had fled before their arrival. Otherwise, King continued with a campaign to recruit volunteers, hoping to address the problem with the shortage of troops caused by heavy losses in the Dieppe Raid in 1942, in Italy in 1943, and after the Battle of Normandy in 1944. In November 1944, the Government decided it was necessary to send conscripts to Europe for the war. This led to a brief political crisis (see Conscription Crisis of 1944) and a mutiny by conscripts posted in British Columbia, but the war ended a few months later. Over 15,000 conscripts went to Europe, though only a few hundred saw combat.\n\nFollowing the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Japanese Canadians were categorized as enemy aliens under the War Measures Act, which began to remove their personal rights. Starting on December 8, 1941, 1,200 Japanese-Canadian-owned fishing vessels were impounded as a \"defence measure.\" On January 14, 1942, the federal government passed an order calling for the removal of male Japanese nationals between 18 and 45 years of age from a designated protected area of 100 miles inland from the British Columbia coast, enacted a ban against Japanese-Canadian fishing during the war, banned shortwave radios and controlled the sale of gasoline and dynamite to Japanese Canadians. Japanese nationals removed from the coast after the January 14 order were sent to road camps around Jasper, Alberta. \nThree weeks later, on February 19, 1942, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which called for the removal of 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry from the American coastline. A historian of internment, Ann Sunahara, argues that \"the American action sealed the fate of Japanese Canadians.\"\nOn February 24, the federal government passed order-in-council PC 1468 which allowed for the removal of \"all persons of Japanese origin\" This order-in-council allowed the Minister of Justice the broad powers of removing people from any protected area in Canada, but was meant for Japanese Canadians on the Pacific coast in particular. On February 25, the federal government announced that Japanese Canadians were being moved for reasons of national security. In all, some 27,000 people were detained without charge or trial, and their property confiscated. Others were deported to Japan.\nKing and his Cabinet ignored reports from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian military that most of the Japanese were law-abiding and not a threat. Major General Ken Stuart told Ottawa, \"I cannot see that the Japanese Canadians constitute the slightest menace to national security.\" King's political direction on this issue closely followed postulates from his 1909 doctoral thesis at Harvard.\n\nOn September 22, 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney delivered an apology for the internment, and the Canadian government announced a compensation package.\n\nThroughout his tenure, King led Canada from a colony with responsible government to an autonomous nation within the British Commonwealth. King asserted Canadian autonomy against the British government's attempts to turn the Commonwealth into an alliance. His biographer asserts that \"in this struggle MacKenzie King was the constant aggressor\". The Canadian High Commissioner to Britain, Vincent Massey, claimed that an \"anti-British bias\" was \"one of the most powerful factors in his make-up\".\n\nDuring the Chanak Crisis of 1922, King refused to support the British without first consulting Parliament, while the Conservative leader, Arthur Meighen, supported Britain. King wrote in his diary of the British appeal: \"I confess it annoyed me. It is drafted designedly to play the imperial game, to test out centralization versus autonomy as regards European wars...No [Canadian] contingent will go without parliament being summoned in the first instance\". The British were disappointed with King's response but the crisis was soon resolved, as King had anticipated. After Chanak, King was concerned about the possibility that Canada might go to war because of its connections with Britain, writing to Violet Markham:\n\nAnything like centralization in London, to say nothing of a direct or indirect attempt on the part of those in office in Downing Street to tell the people of the Dominions what they should or should not do, and to dictate their duty in matters of foreign policy, is certain to prove just as injurious to the so-called 'imperial solidarity' as any attempt at interference in questions of purely domestic concern. If membership within the British Commonwealth means participation by the Dominions in any and every war in which Great Britain becomes involved, without consultation, conference, or agreement of any kind in advance, I can see no hope for an enduring relationship.\n\nKing therefore went to the Imperial Conference of 1926 and argued for greater autonomy of the Dominions. This resulted in the Balfour Declaration 1926, which announced the equal status of all members of the British Commonwealth (as it was known then), including Britain. This eventually led to the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canadian city of Hamilton hosted the first Empire Games in 1930; this competition later became known as the Commonwealth Games, and is held every four years.\n\nIn the lead-up to World War II in 1939, King affirmed Canadian autonomy by saying that the Canadian Parliament would make the final decision on the issue of going to war. He reassured the pro-British Canadians that Parliament would surely decide that Canada would be at Britain's side if Great Britain was drawn into a major war. At the same time, he reassured those who were suspicious of British influence in Canada by promising that Canada would not participate in British colonial wars. His Quebec lieutenant, Ernest Lapointe, promised French-Canadians that the government would not introduce conscription; individual participation would be voluntary. In 1939, in a country which had seemed deeply divided, these promises made it possible for Parliament to agree almost unanimously to declare war.\n\nKing played two roles. On the one hand, he told English Canadians that Canada would no doubt enter war if Britain did. On the other hand, he and his Quebec lieutenant Ernest Lapointe told French Canadians that Canada would only go to war if it was in the country's best interests. With the dual messages, King slowly led Canada toward war without causing strife between Canada's two main linguistic communities. As his final step in asserting Canada's autonomy, King ensured that the Canadian Parliament made its own declaration of war one week after Britain.\n\nDuring the war, Canada rapidly expanded its diplomatic missions abroad. However British Prime Minister Winston Churchill made all the major military and diplomatic decisions for Canada and the other dominions, with minimal consultation. While Canada hosted two major Allied conferences in Quebec in 1943 and 1944, neither Mackenzie King nor his senior generals and admirals were invited to take part in any of the discussions.\nKing's government introduced the \"Canadian Citizenship Act\" in 1946, which officially created the notion of \"Canadian citizens\". Prior to this, Canadians were considered British subjects living in Canada. On January 3, 1947, King received Canadian citizenship certificate number 0001.\n\nWith the war winding down, King held a federal election in 1945 and won a minority, but formed a functioning coalition to continue governing. As King was defeated in his own riding of Prince Albert, fellow Liberal William MacDiarmid, who was re-elected in the safe seat of Glengarry, resigned so that a by-election could be held, which was subsequently won by King. \n\nThe main opposition party Conservatives were weak for most of the two decades after R. B. Bennett lost the 1935 election, and King had virtually unchallenged power for much of his later years; this expanded still further during the War. He promoted engineer C. D. Howe into positions of great power and influence during the War, but was hit hard by the 1940 death of key minister and protege Norman McLeod Rogers. After this setback, and the 1941 death of his Quebec lieutenant Ernest Lapointe, King sought out the reluctant Louis St. Laurent, a leading Quebec lawyer, to take over Lapointe's role, and eventually persuaded St. Laurent to serve as a top aide.\n\nKing helped found the United Nations in 1945 and attended the opening meetings in San Francisco. However, he became pessimistic about the organization's future possibilities. After the war, King quickly dismantled wartime controls. Unlike World War I, press censorship ended with the hostilities. He began an ambitious program of social programs and laid the groundwork for Newfoundland's later entry into Canada.\n\nKing moved Canada into the deepening Cold War in alliance with the U.S. and Britain. He dealt with the espionage revelations of Soviet cipher clerk Igor Gouzenko, who defected in Ottawa in September 1945, by quickly appointing a Royal Commission to investigate Gouzenko's allegations of a Canadian Communist spy-ring transmitting top-secret documents to Moscow. External Affairs Minister Louis St. Laurent dealt decisively with this crisis, the first of its type in Canada's history. St. Laurent's leadership deepened King's respect, and helped make St. Laurent the next Canadian Prime Minister three years later.\n\nOn January 20, 1948, King called on the Liberal Party to hold its first national convention since 1919 to choose a new leader. The August convention chose St. Laurent as the new leader of the Liberal Party. Three months later, King retired after 22 years as prime minister. King also had the most terms (six) as Prime Minister. Sir John A. Macdonald was second-in-line, with 19 years, as the longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (1867–1873, 1878–1891). King was not charismatic and did not have a large personal following. Only eight Canadians in 100 picked him when the Canadian Gallup (CIPO) poll asked in September 1946, \"What person living in any part of the world today do you admire?\" Nevertheless, his Liberal Party was easily re-elected in the election of 1945.\n\nKing died on July 22, 1950, at Kingsmere from pneumonia, with his retirement plans to write his memoirs unfulfilled. He is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.\n\nKing lacked a commanding presence or oratorical skills; he did not shine on the radio or in newsreels. There was scant charisma. Cold and tactless in human relations, he had allies but very few close personal friends; he never married and lacked a hostess whose charm could substitute for his chill. His allies were annoyed by his constant intrigues.\n\nHe is not remembered for great major policy innovations as prime minister. Christopher Moore says, \"King had made 'Parliament will decide' his maxim, and he trotted it out whenever he wished to avoid a decision.\"\n\nScholars attribute King's long tenure as party leader to his wide range of skills that were appropriate to Canada's needs. \nKing kept a very candid diary from 1893, when he was still an undergraduate, until a few days before his death in 1950; the volumes, stacked in a row, span a length of over seven metres and comprise over 50,000 manuscript pages of typed transcribed text. One biographer called these diaries \"the most important single political document in twentieth-century Canadian history,\" for they explain motivations of the Canadian war efforts and describe other events in detail.\n\nKing's occult interests were kept secret during his years in office, and only became publicized after his death when his diaries were opened. Readers were amazed. King communed with spirits, using seances with paid mediums. Thereby, he claimed to have communicated with Leonardo da Vinci, Wilfrid Laurier, his dead mother, his grandfather, and several of his dead dogs, as well as the spirit of the late President Roosevelt. Some historians argue that he sought personal reassurance from the spirit world, more than political advice. After his death, one of his mediums said that she had not realized that he was a politician. King did inquire whether his party would win the 1935 election, one of the few times politics came up during his seances. However Allan Levine argues that sometimes he did pay attention to the political implications of his seances: \"All of his spiritualist experiences, his other superstitions and his multi-paranoid reactions imprinted on his consciousness, shaping his thoughts and feelings in a thousand different ways.\"\n\nHistorians have seen in his spiritualism and occult activities a penchant for forging unities from antitheses, thus having latent political import. Historian C.P. Stacey, in his 1976 book \"A Very Double Life\" examined King's secret life in detail, argued that King did not allow his beliefs to influence his decisions on political matters. Stacey wrote that King entirely gave up his interests in the occult and spiritualism during World War II.\n\nKing never married, but had several close female friends, including Joan Patteson, a married woman with whom he spent some of his leisure time; sometimes she served as hostess at his dinner parties. He did not have a wife who could be the hostess all the time and handle the many social obligations that he tried to downplay. Editor Charles Bowman reports that, \"He felt the lack of a wife, particularly when social duties called for a hostess.\"\n\nSome historians have interpreted passages in his diaries as suggesting that King regularly had sexual relations with prostitutes. Others, also basing their claims on passages of his diaries, have suggested that King was in love with Lord Tweedsmuir, whom he had chosen for appointment as Governor General in 1935.\n\nAlong with Wilfrid Laurier, King was the only other Canadian Prime Minister to be in office during the reigns of three Canadian Monarchs.\n\nKing was ranked as the greatest Canadian Prime Minister by a survey of Canadian historians.\n\nHe was named a Person of National Historic Significance in 1968.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n\nKing's likeness is on the Canadian fifty-dollar note since 1975.\n\nKing left no published political memoirs, although his private diaries were extensively detailed. His main published work remains his 1918 book \"Industry and Humanity\".\n\nFollowing the publication of King's diaries in the 1970s, several fictional works about him were published by Canadian writers. These included Elizabeth Gourlay's novel \"Isabel\", Allan Stratton's play \"Rexy\" and Heather Robertson's trilogy \"Willie: A Romance\" (1983), \"Lily: A Rhapsody in Red\" (1986), and \"Igor: A Novel of Intrigue\" (1989).\n\nIn 1998, there was controversy over King's exclusion from a memorial to the Quebec Conference, which was attended by King, Roosevelt, and Churchill. The monument was commissioned by the sovereigntist Parti Québécois government of Quebec, which justified the decision on their interpretation that King was acting merely as a host for the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. Canadian federalists, however, accused the government of Quebec of trying to advance their own political agenda.\n\nOC Transpo has a Transitway station named Mackenzie King due to its location on the Mackenzie King Bridge. It is located adjacent to the Rideau Centre in downtown Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nThe bridge across the Rideau Canal in downtown Ottawa, built following World War II, is named in his honour to recognize his contributions to the land planning of the city of Ottawa.\n\nPart of his country retreat, now called Mackenzie King Estate, at Kingsmere in the Gatineau Park, near Ottawa, is open to the public. The house King died in, called \"The Farm\", is the official residence of the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, and is not part of the park.\nThe Woodside National Historic Site in Kitchener, Ontario was King's boyhood home. The estate has over 4.65 hectares of garden and parkland for exploring and relaxing, and the house has been restored to reflect life during King's era. There is a MacKenzie King Public School in the Heritage Park neighbourhood in Kitchener. Kitchener was known as Berlin until 1916.\n\nKing was mentioned in the book \"Alligator Pie\" by Dennis Lee, appearing as the subject of a nonsensical children's poem, which reads \"William Lyon Mackenzie King / He sat in the middle and played with string / He loved his mother like anything / William Lyon Mackenzie King.\"\n\nKing is a prominent character in Donald Jack's novel \"Me Too\", set in Ottawa in the 1920s.\n\nA character who appeared twice in the popular 1990s Canadian television series \"Due South\" was named \"Mackenzie King\" in obvious reference.\n\nKing chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his contributions in the urban development of Kiev, with buildings such as the House with Chimaeras, the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral, the Karaite Kenesa, and the National Art Museum of Ukraine.\n\nIn Kiev Horodecki often worked along with a sculptor from Milan, Emilio Sala, who was an instructor at the Kiev City College.\n\nHorodecki was born into a noble Polish szlachta family of the Kornic coat of arms in the village of Szołudki (Sholudky, now Mukhivtsi Rural Council, Nemyriv Raion, Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine). His ancestors were big landowners (\"didych\") in the Podillya region. Horodecki graduated from the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg in 1890, while prior to that he finished a realschule in Odessa. After 1890 Horodecki moved to Kiev where he lived for almost 30 years.\n\nAs Poland regained its independence after the Polish-Soviet War in 1920, and Russia, including Kiev, fell under Bolshevism, he emigrated to Warsaw. In Poland Horodecki headed an American Project Bureau \"Henry Ulan & Co.\".

Widely regarded as a patriot in Chinese culture, he is best known for defending Liaoning from Jurchen invaders during the Later Jin invasion of the Ming. As a general, Yuan Chonghuan excelled as a cannoneer and sought to incorporate European cannon designs into the Ming arsenal.\n\nYuan's military career reached its height when he defeated the Jurchen ruler, Nurhaci, and his army in the first Battle of Ningyuan. Later on, Yuan also defeated Nurhaci's son and successor, Hong Taiji, and his 200,000-strong army composed of mostly Mongol soldiers at the second Battle of Ningyuan. Yuan met his end when he was arrested and executed by \"lingchi\" (\"slow slicing\") on the order of the Chongzhen Emperor under false charges of treason, which were believed to have been planted against him by the Jurchens.\n\nYuan was born in Dongguan, Guangdong. During his adolescence, he spent time traveling from town to town. Although he took the imperial examination repeatedly with little success, he gained a lot of practical experience during his travels to the capital. It is said that he befriended several Jesuits during this time and spent much time working on modifying European cannons.\n\nYuan passed the imperial examination in 1619 and was appointed as the magistrate of a remote county. In 1619, the Ming imperial army was defeated by the Jurchens in the Battle of Sarhu. Ming forces suffered successive defeats and in 1622 they were forced to retreat to Shanhai Pass, abandoning all of Liaoning to the Jurchens. After a visit to the front, Yuan was appointed as a second-class secretary in the Ministry of War, then promoted almost immediately to full secretary and supplied with funds for enlisting troops. Yuan's rapid promotion was quite notable at the time as he did not have any formal military training at all, save for studying the Confucian classics in order to pass the imperial examination.\n\nYuan cooperated with the commander-in-chief Sun Chengzong in pushing the frontiers steadily northward, fortifying Ningyuan in 1623. The elderly Sun was an able commander but refused to bribe Wei Zhongxian, an influential court eunuch under the Tianqi Emperor. Consequently, Sun was recalled in 1625 and replaced by Gao Di (), who ordered a general retreat to Shanhai Pass. However, Yuan flatly refused to leave Ningyuan.\n\nEarly in the next year, Nurhaci led the Jurchens back across the Liao River. Yuan and his deputies successfully held Ningyuan with the newly mounted and modified \"hongyipao\" and only 9,000 militiamen against Nurhaci's 130,000-strong army. The victory at Ningyuan prevented immediate advances by the Jurchens.\n\nYuan was said to have studied every aspect of the cannon for it to fire accurately at the position he wanted, and this is given as the reason why Nurhaci, although well-protected by his elite guards in a safe position, was wounded by cannon fire. After the battle, Yuan sent letters to ask the well-being of Nurhaci, as traditionally done by Chinese generals, but Nurhaci returned an insult by calling him duplicitous.\n\nAs a result of this victory, the Ming imperial court in Beijing appointed Yuan as the Governor of Liaodong on 27 February 1626, with full authority to handle all forces outside the passes.\n\nDuring this time, Yuan executed Mao Wenlong, a Ming general regarded as ruthless but talented. Various texts have different opinions of his actions. Many stated this was a mistake since Mao could still be used against the Jurchens. However, Yuan took into account how Mao conducted his battles: Mao's tactics usually involved using civilian settlements as a shield for his troops, and during the occupation the civilians suffered tremendously. Mao also used the Joseon kingdom, Ming's ally, as a base to launch expeditions against the Jurchens. When the Jurchens entered Joseon, Mao ordered a general retreat of Ming forces. This angered many merchants in the Beijing area who traded in the Korean Peninsula. In addition, Mao was known to have bribed many corrupt eunuchs and officials. Consequently, by executing Mao, Yuan made enemies with some of the most influential people in China.\n\nTaking advantage of Nurhaci's death later in the year, Yuan reoccupied Jinzhou. The Jurchens reappeared in June and withdrew after a series of indecisive battles. Yuan was criticised by the partisans of Wei Zhongxian, who stated that he took too long to fight off the Jurchens. Shortly thereafter Yuan was forced into retirement.\n\nIn 1628, under the reign of the Chongzhen Emperor, Yuan was reinstated as the field marshal of all the Ming forces in the northeast. He embarked on an ambitious five-year plan for the complete recovery of Liaodong. The Chongzhen Emperor had begun his reign in 1627 at the age of 16, and in 1629 (at the age of 18) he appointed Yuan. In 1629, Yuan was granted the title of \"Senior Guardian of the Heir Apparent\". The emperor gave Yuan his Imperial Sword and stated that he would fully support Yuan's decisions.\n\nThis time Yuan had to face again a larger Jurchen force of over 200,000 troops under Nurhaci's successor, Hong Taiji. The Jurchens had incorporated more men into their army, including the newly surrendered Mongols and Ming rebels. They conquered various small tribes in northern China, and defeated Joseon in order to secure it as a tributary. However, the Jurchens never attacked Jinzhou or Ningyuan again. Instead, they bypassed Jinzhou, Ningyuan and Shanhai Pass altogether. They broke through the Great Wall west of Shanhai Pass and reached the north of Beijing in the winter of 1629. Yuan rushed back with a selected veteran force from Ningyuan to defend the capital. He reached Beijing just days before the Jurchens. Outside the city wall of Beijing, he defeated the Jurchen Eight Banners which numbered around 100,000 men, but failed to destroy the Jurchen army. The Jurchens' surprise attack on Beijing was foiled. Despite the fact that Yuan prevented the Jurchens from even reaching the city wall, Yuan was heavily criticized when he arrived in Beijing, and some eunuchs even accused Yuan of collaborating with the enemy.\n\nThe Chongzhen Emperor ordered Yuan's arrest during an audience on 13 January 1630. Despite little evidence, Yuan was accused of collusion with the enemy and sentenced to death by \"lingchi\" (\"slow slicing\") at Ganshiqiao () in Beijing. When Yuan was asked for last words before his execution, he produced the following poem: \"A life's work always ends up in vain; half of my career seems to be in dreams. I do not worry about lacking brave warriors after my death, for my loyal spirit will continue to guard Liaodong.\" () Imperial records showed he took half a day to die.\n\nYuan was mourned throughout most of the country outside Beijing and even in the kingdom of Joseon. After his death, many took note of the Ming and their allies's weak position as favorable conditions for another Jurchen invasion.\n\nIt was said that upon hearing of his apparent \"betrayal\", many Beijing residents hated Yuan so much that they rushed to buy his body parts so they could eat them as soon as they were sliced off his body. He was left there after the torture, shouting for half a day before stopping. His head, the only recognisable part after the execution, was taken outside the Inner City Wall by a city guard, whose surname was She (佘), and buried in Huashi near Guangqumen. The guard's family have guarded it for generations since. His tomb was recently renovated and renamed the Yuan Chonghuan Memorial, located at Longtan Park.\n\nYuan's name was cleared nearly a century later by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, after conclusive evidence was found in old archives of the Qing imperial court supporting his innocence. The Qianlong Emperor tried to express his kindness by searching for and rewarding Yuan's direct descendants, but failed to find any.\n\nIn the \"wuxia\" novel \"Sword Stained with Royal Blood\" by Jin Yong, Yuan is survived by a fictional son, Yuan Chengzhi, the protagonist of the novel. Yuan Chengzhi was saved by his father's subordinates after his father was executed and taken to the Mount Hua Sect, where he learnt martial arts. Several years later, when he had grown up, he left Mount Hua and traveled around in search of adventure and to redress his father's legacy.\n\nCelebrated as a Cantonese hero, during a 2010 rally, protesters in Guangzhou used Yuan's battle cry against his Jurchen enemies during the Battle of Ningyuan: \"Fuck his mom! Hit them hard!\" () as a chant.\n\nIn the 2017 TVB drama \"A General, a Scholar and a Eunuch\", Yuan Chonghuan was portrayed by Edwin Siu.\n\n"}
