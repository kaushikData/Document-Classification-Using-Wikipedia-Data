By the age of 27 he became editor of the \"Sunday Graphic\" for a year, then in 1959 became managing editor of the \"News Chronicle\". In 1960, both papers closed, and Hall began writing a gossip column for the \"Daily Herald\".\n\nHall remained a columnist as the \"Herald\" became \"The Sun\", but left in 1969 when Rupert Murdoch bought the paper. He joined the \"Sunday Times\", where he launched a lifestyle section before taking over the \"Atticus\" diary column. Having long had an interest in wine, being known for spending long lunches in the Connaught Rooms, he convinced editor Harold Evans to launch the Sunday Times Wine Club. By now writing regularly about wine, Hall decided in 1972 to organise an annual race to bring Beaujolais Nouveau to Britain. This was replicating a private race by Clement Freud (Wine Correspondent for The Son) and Joseph Berkmann (agent for Georges DuBoeuf) in 1970 and 1971. This race, became a reality in 1972, with a bottle of champagne up for grabs for the winner. This was collected by the first to arrive at The Sunday Times offices having let themselves into the building! This was later replicated in other countries, and by the 1980s attracted widespread interest.

For this one meal he claimed, and was paid, expenses of more than £11,000. The magazine closed the following year, after which Hall retired to Suffolk, selling wine and offering tasting sessions. He continued writing about wine on a freelance basis, and organised wine tours of France.\n"}
{"id": "1192060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1192060", "title": "Anarky", "text": "Anarky\n\nAnarky is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Co-created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, he first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" No. 608 (November 1989), as an adversary of Batman. Introduced as Lonnie Machin, a child prodigy with knowledge of radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the philosophy of anarchism, primarily espouses anti-statism; however, multiple social issues have been addressed through the character, including environmentalism, antimilitarism, economic inequality, and political corruption. Inspired by multiple sources, early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration for the creation of the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in anti-authoritarian philosophy and politics. However, when Grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of Neo-Tech, developed by Frank R. Wallace, he shifted the focus of Anarky from a vehicle for socialist and populist philosophy, to rationalist, atheist, and free market thinking.\n\nOriginally intended to only be used in the debut story in which he appeared, Grant decided to continue using Anarky as a sporadically recurring character throughout the early 1990s, following positive reception by readers and Dennis O'Neil. The character experienced a brief surge in media exposure during the late 1990s when Norm Breyfogle convinced Grant to produce a limited series based on the character. The 1997 spin-off series, \"Anarky\", was received with positive reviews and sales, and later declared by Grant to be among his \"career highlights\". \"\", a trade paperback collection of stories featuring the character, soon followed. This popular acclaim culminated, however, in a financially and critically unsuccessful ongoing solo series. The 1999 \"Anarky\" series, in which even Grant has expressed his distaste, was quickly canceled after eight issues.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of the \"Anarky\" series, and Grant's departure from DC Comics, Anarky experienced a prolonged period of absence from DC publications, despite professional and fan interest in his return. This period of obscurity lasted approximately nine years, with three brief interruptions for minor cameo appearances in 2000, 2001, and 2005. In 2008, Anarky reappeared in an issue of \"Robin\" authored by Fabian Nicieza, with the intention of ending this period of obscurity. The storyline drastically altered the character's presentation, prompting a series of responses by Nicieza to concerned readers. Anarky became a recurring character in issues of \"Red Robin\", authored by Nicieza, until the series was cancelled in 2011 in the aftermath of The New 52. A new Anarky was introduced into the New 52 continuity in October 2013, in an issue of \"Green Lantern Corps\", which itself was a tie-in to the \"\" storyline. Yet more characters have been authored as using the Anarky alias in the New 52 continuity via the pages of \"Detective Comics\" and \"Earth 2: Society\".\n\nFrom 2013, Anarky began to be featured more heavily in media adaptations of DC Comics properties, across multiple platforms. In July, a revamped version of Anarky was debuted as the primary antagonist in \"Beware the Batman\", a Batman animated series produced by Warner Bros. Animation. In October, the character made his video game debut in \"\", as a villain who threatens government and corporate institutions with destruction. Anarky made his live action debut in the Green Arrow television series \"Arrow\" in 2015, portrayed by Alexander Calvert, once again as a villain.\n\nOriginally inspired by his personal political leanings, Alan Grant entertained the idea of interjecting anarchist philosophy into Batman comic books. In an attempt to emulate the success of Chopper, a rebellious youth in Judge Dredd, he conceptualized a character as a twelve-year-old anarchist vigilante, who readers would sympathize with despite the character's harsh methods; as well, in the wake of the death of Jason Todd, Grant hoped that Anarky could be used as the new Robin.\nCreating the character without any consultation from his partner, illustrator Norm Breyfogle, his only instructions to Breyfogle were that Anarky be designed as a cross between V and the black spy from \"Mad\" magazine's \"Spy vs. Spy\". The character was also intended to wear a costume that disguised his youth, and so was fitted with a crude \"head extender\" that elongated his neck, creating a jarring appearance. This was in fact intended as a ruse on the part of writer Alan Grant to disguise the character's true identity, and to confuse the reader into believing Anarky to be an adult. While both of these design elements have since been dropped, more enduring aspects of the character have been his golden face mask, \"priestly\" hat, and his golden cane.\n\nThe first Anarky story, \"Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor\", appeared in \"Detective Comics\" No. 608, in November 1989. Lonnie Machin is introduced as \"Anarky\" as early as his first appearance in \"Detective Comics\" No.608, withholding his origin story for a later point. He is established as an uncommonly philosophical and intelligent twelve-year-old. Lonnie Machin made his debut as \"Anarky\" by responding to complaints in the newspaper by attacking the offending sources, such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste is polluting local river water. Anarky and Batman ultimately come to blows, and during their brief fight, Batman deduces that Anarky is actually a young child. During this first confrontation, Anarky is aided by a band of homeless men, including Legs, a homeless cripple who becomes loyal to him and would assist him in later appearances. After being caught, Lonnie is locked away in a juvenile detention center.\n\nFollowing the comic book industry crash of 1996, Norm Breyfogle sought new employment at DC Comics. Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant at the company, suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in. Among his suggestions was an Anarky limited series, to be written by Grant or another specified author. Following encouragement from Breyfogle, Grant agreed to participate in the project. The four-issue limited series, \"Anarky\", was published in May 1997. Entitled \"Metamorphosis\", the story maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace.\n\nWell received by critics and financially successful, Grant has referred to the limited series as one of his favorite projects, and ranked it among his \"career highlights\". With its success, Vincenzo suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to Breyfogle and Grant. Although Grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable, he agreed to write it at Breyfogle's insistence, as the illustrator was still struggling for employment. Building on the increasing exposure of the series, a trade paperback featuring the character titled \"\" was published. However, Grant's doubts concerning the ongoing series's prospects eventually proved correct. The second series was panned by critics, failed to catch on among readers, and was canceled after eight issues; however Grant has noted that it was popular in Latin American countries, supposing this was due to a history of political repression in the region.\n\nAfter the financial failure of \"Anarky\" vol. 2, the character entered a period of absence from DC publications that lasted several years. Norm Breyfogle attempted to continue using the character in other comics during this time. However, when his efforts were rejected, he came to suspect the character's prolonged absence was due in part to censorship. Since the cancellation of the \"Anarky\" series, Grant has disassociated himself from the direction of the character, simply stating, \"you have to let these things go.\"\n\nIn 2005, James Peaty succeeded in temporarily returning Anarky to publication, writing \"Green Arrow\" No.51, \"Anarky in the USA\". Although the front cover of the issue advertised the comic as the \"return\" of the character, Anarky failed to make any further appearances. This was despite comments by Peaty that he had further plans to write stories for the character.\n\nAnarky retained interest among a cult fan base during this obscure period. During a panel at WonderCon 2006, multiple requests were made by the audience for Anarky to appear in DC Comic's limited series, \"52\". In response, editors and writers of \"52\" indicated Anarky would be included in the series. However, the series concluded without Anarky making an appearance, and with no explanation given by anyone involved in the production of the series for the failed appearance.\n\nOn August 15, 2008, DC Comics announced that Anarky would reappear in the December issue of \"Robin\", issue No.181. With the publication of \"Robin\" No.181, \"Search For a Hero, Part 5: Pushing Buttons, Pulling Strings\", on December 17, 2008, it was revealed that Lonnie Machin's role as Anarky had been supplanted by another Batman villain, Ulysses Armstrong. Fabian Nicieza, author of the issue and storyline in which Anarky appeared, depicted the character as being held hostage by Armstrong, \"paralyzed and catatonic\", encased in an iron lung, and connected to computers through his brain. This final feature allowed the character to connect to the internet and communicate with others via a speech synthesizer. Nicieza's decision to give Machin's mantle as Anarky to another character was due to his desire to establish him as a nemesis for Tim Drake, while respecting the original characterization of Anarky, who Nicieza recognized as neither immature, nor a villain. Regardless, Nicieza did desire to use Machin and properly return the character to publication, and so favored presenting Ulysses H. Armstrong as Anarky, and Lonnie Machin as Moneyspider, a reference to a secondary name briefly used by Grant for Anarky in storyline published in 1990.\nThe reactions to \"Robin\" No.181 included negative commentary from political commentator and scholar, Roderick Long, and Alan Grant himself. Among fans who interacted with Nicieza in a forum discussion, some responses were also negative, prompting responses from Nicieza in his own defense.\n\nWith the conclusion of \"Robin\", Nicieza began authoring the 2009 \"Azrael\" series, leaving any future use of Anarky or Moneyspider to author Christopher Yost, who would pick up the Robin character in a new \"Red Robin\" series. However, in the ensuing months, Yost only made one brief reference to Anarky, without directly involving the character in a story plot. In April 2010, it was announced that Nicieza would replace Yost as the author of \"Red Robin\", and Nicieza was quick to note his interest in using Anarky and Moneyspider in future issues of the series. Nicieza reintroduced Ulysses Armstrong and Lonnie Machin within his first storyline, beginning in \"Red Robin\" No.16, \"The Hit List\", in December 2010. Nicieza then proceeded to regularly use Lonnie as a cast member of the ongoing \"Red Robin\" series, until its cancellation in October 2011. The series was concluded as a result of The New 52, a revamp and relaunch by DC Comics of its entire line of ongoing monthly superhero books, in which all of its existing titles were canceled. 52 new series debuted in September 2011 with new No. 1 issues to replace the cancelled titles.\n\nWhile Anarky was \"rising in profile in other media\" by mid 2013, the character had yet to be reintroduced to the status quo of the post-New 52 DC Universe. This changed on August 12, when DC Comics announced that Anarky would be reintroduced in \"Green Lantern Corps\" No. 25, \"Powers That Be\", on November 13, 2013. The issue was a tie-in to the \"\" crossover event, authored by Van Jensen and co-plotted by Robert Venditti.\n\nIn the lead up to the publication date, at a panel event at the New York Comic Con, Jensen was asked by a fan holding a \"plush Anarky doll\" what the character's role would be in the story. Jensen explained that Anarky \"would have a very big hand\" in the story, and further explained, \"you can understand what he's doing even if you don't agree with what he's doing.\" Jensen had also indicated that his version of Anarky would be a \"fresh take that also honors his legacy.\" The story featured a character study of John Stewart, narrating Stewart's final mission as a young Marine in the midst of a Gotham City power blackout and citywide evacuation, mere days before a major storm is to hit the city. Anarky is depicted as rallying a group of followers and evacuees to occupy a sports stadium, on the basis that the area the stadium was built upon was gentrified at the expense of the local community and should be returned to them. The storyline brought two particular additions to the revamped version of Anarky; the first being that this new version of Anarky is portrayed as an African American; the second being to preserve the character's anonymity, as Anarky escapes custody at the end of the story without an identity behind the mask being revealed.\n\nAnother version of Anarky debuted in the post-New 52 \"Detective Comics\" series, written by Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato. This character isn't the same Anarky that appeared in \"Batman: Zero Year\", but rather a corrupt politician named Sam Young who used the Anarky persona to exact revenge on the Mad Hatter for murdering his sister.\n\nA female version of Anarky from the alternate reality of Earth-Two was introduced in \"Earth 2: Society\"'s 2015 story line, \"Godhood\", by Daniel H. Wilson. Prior to the fictional events of the series, this Anarky detonated a bomb in the city of Neotropolis that resulted in a public riot. She disappears before Superman and Power Girl can apprehend her. In the series, she is portrayed as a hacker that is allied with such characters as Doctor Impossible, Hourman, and Johnny Sorrow.\n\nTeased as a \"very unlikely ally,\" Anarky appears for the first time in DC Rebirth on May 24, 2017. Revealed in \"Detective Comics\" #957 (May 2016), a redesigned Anarky offers to help Spoiler in her new quest against vigilantism in Gotham.\n\nAnarky has undergone several shifts in his characterization over the course of the character's existence. These were largely decided upon by Alan Grant, who between the creation of Anarky to the end of the 1999 \"Anarky\" series, was largely the sole author of the character. After the departure of Grant and Breyfogle from DC Comics, Anarky's characterization fell to various authors who utilized him thereafter.\n\nLonnie Machin is introduced as a twelve-year-old school boy. An only child, he shares his physical traits of light skin and red hair with both of his parents, Mike and Roxanne Machin, a middle-class family living in Gotham City. The character's age was continuously adjusted over the course of several years; stated to be fourteen during \"The Anarky Ultimatum\" in \"Robin Annual\" No.1, it is reestablished as fifteen during the events of the \"Anarky\" limited series, and adjusted as sixteen the following year during the ongoing series.\n\nGrant laconically described Lonnie Machin as \"a serious-beyond-his-years teenager who wants to set the world to rights.\" As the character was based on a theme of ideas, he had initially been given no personal, tragic past, a common motivator in superhero fiction. This was intended to contrast with Batman, who fought crime due to personal tragedy, while Anarky would do so in the name of ideals and beliefs. As the character was further developed, he was also intended to contrast with common teenage superheroes. Referring to the tradition established by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby of saddling teenagers with personal problems, Grant purposely gave Anarky none, nor did he develop a girlfriend or social life for the character. As Grant wrote for the \"Batman: Anarky\" introduction, this was intended to convey the idea that Anarky was single minded in his goals. In one of the earliest explorations of Lonnie Machin's back story in \"The Anarky Ultimatum\", Grant described Lonnie as a prolific reader, but also of being isolated from peers his own age during his childhood. This was elaborated upon years later in the \"Anarky\" storyline, which described Lonnie as having lost a childhood friend living in an impoverished nation, the latter suffering the loss of his family due to civil war and strife before disappearing entirely. The resulting shock of discovering at such a young age that the world was in turmoil precipitated Lonnie Machin's rapid maturation and eventual radicalization.\n\nAnarky's introduction during the late 1980s was part of a larger shift among supervillains in the \"Batman\" franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to \"question the whole bad/good guy divide.\" Falling into \"the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image\", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the \"Anarky\" miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an \"anti-villain\", as opposed to \"antihero\", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: \"In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the Punisher, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really wants is to save the world ... and maybe he's \"right\".\"\n\nBreyfogle's characterization of Anarky has shifted on occasion, with him at times referring to Anarky as a villain, and at other times as a hero. In his 1998 introductory essay composed for \"\", Breyfogle characterized Anarky as not being a villain, but rather a \"misunderstood hero\", and continued \"he's a \"philosophical\" action hero, an Aristotle in tights, rising above mere 'crime-fighter' status into the realm of incisive social commentary.\" A year later, Breyfogle conceded that Anarky was \"technically\" a villain, but insisted \"I don't consider him a villain ...\" Breyfogle later reconsidered the character in more ambiguous terms for a 2005 interview: \"Anarky isn't a villain, he's his own character. He's definitely not a superhero, although it depends on who you talk to.\"\n\nGrant has been more direct in his description of Anarky's virtuous attributes: \"In my eyes, Anarky's a hero. Anarky's the hero I want to be if I was smart enough and physically fit enough.\" Acknowledging that Anarky's moral perspective was guided by his own, Grant expressed that the conflict between Anarky and other heroes is a result of their political divisions: \"In my eyes, he's a hero, but to others, they see him as a villain. That is because most people might gripe about the political situation, or various aspects of the political situation, and wouldn't advocate the total overthrow of the system under which we live. Anarky certainly does that, and more.\"\n\nIn creating stories involving Anarky, other writers have played off this anti-heroic and anti-villainous tension. James Peaty made the heroic and political comparisons between Lonnie Machin and Oliver Queen the central theme of his 2005 \"Green Arrow\" story, \"Anarky in the USA\": \"Anarky comes to find Ollie because of his reputation and is quite disappointed in Ollie's reaction towards him. However, as the story unfolds, Ollie has to re-assess his initial reaction to Anarky and his own much vaunted 'radical' credentials.\"\nIn the character's 2013 video game debut in \"\", creative director Eric Holmes dubbed Anarky a \"classic anti-villain\". A \"social activist\" who wishes to \"liberate and free people\", Anarky views himself as a hero akin to Batman and offers an alliance with him. However his approach is rebuked on the basis that their methods are nothing alike. Nonetheless, he attracts a following among the city's downtrodden and particularly the homeless, whom he protects from the hostility of police officers. This \"special relationship\" between the homeless who look up to a villain, who in turn acts as their protector against police who prey upon them, was intended to present an area of grey morality for the player to consider.\n\nOn two occasions Grant nearly went against Dennis O'Neil's early wish that Anarky not kill opponents. These events include his appearance during the \"\" saga, in which Grant briefly portrayed Anarky as preparing to kill both the Scarecrow and Batman-Azrael. Grant also implied Anarky was a lethal figure in \"The Last Batman Story\", part of \"Armageddon 2001\" crossover event. In the story, a time traveler shows Batman a possible future in the (relatively) not-too-distant year of 2001. An aged Batman is framed and sentenced to death for murder, but Anarky, now an adult, sympathizes with the fallen hero and breaks into the prison in an attempt to rescue Batman. However, Batman resists his help, on the basis that Anarky has killed others in the past, and the two never reconciled their differences.\n\nGrant later expressed relief that he had not fully committed to portraying Anarky as a potential murderer, as he felt \"Anarky would have compromised his own beliefs if he had taken the route of the criminal-killer.\" Anarky was given a non-lethal approach in \"The Batman Adventures\" No.31, \"Anarky\", written by Alan Grant, who acted as a guest author for the issue. Anarky takes business elites hostage and places them on public trial, broadcast from a pirate television show. He charges these men with such crimes as the creation of land mines that kill or cripple thousands, funding Third World dictators, polluting the air with toxic chemicals, and profiting from wage slavery, and threatens each man with a bomb if the public should find them guilty. When the explosions take place, it is revealed that the bombs are fake, and the public trials were only intended to expose the men and raise public awareness. One bomb explosion carried a specific message. It unfurled a banner that denounced lethal weapons.\n\nContradicting Anarky's non-lethal portrayal, entries for the character in \"Who's Who in the DC Universe\", \"The DC Comics Encyclopedia\", and \"The Supervillain Book\", have falsely referred to Anarky as having killed criminals in early appearances. Norm Breyfogle was also under the false impression that Anarky had killed for several years, having failed to realize the original script for Anarky's debut storyline had been rewritten. Grant eventually explained the situation to Breyfogle in 2006, during a joint interview. Despite this regular equivocation of Anarky with murder and villainy in DC Comics character guides, the company made efforts to describe the character in heroic terms in promoting the 1999 \"Anarky\" series. During this time, DC Comics described Anarky as an \"anti-establishment loose cannon trying to do good as a hero to the disenfranchised\".\n\nIn the initial years following Anarky's creation, Grant rarely incorporated the character into Batman stories, being reserved for stories in which the author wished to make a philosophical point. Originally, Grant created Anarky as an anarchist with socialist and populist leanings. In this early incarnation, Anarky was designed as an avatar for Grant's personal meditations on political philosophy, and specifically for his burgeoning sympathy for anarchism.\n\nWithin the books, the nature of the character's political opinions were often expressed through the character's rhetoric, and by heavy use of the circle-A as a character gimmick. The character's tools often incorporate the circle-A motif into them. In his earliest incarnation, he would also use red spray-paint to leave the circle-A as a calling card at crime scenes. The circle-A has also been used to decorate the character's base of operations, either as graffiti or suspended from wall tapestries.\n\nIn some instances, Anarky's political behavior would stand as the only political element of the story, while in other instances, entire stories would be framed to create a political parable. In \"Batman: Shadow of the Bat Annual\" #2, an \"Elseworlds\" story entitled \"The Tyrant\", Grant made dictatorship and the corrupting influence of power the primary theme. Batman (under the influence of Jonathan Crane) uses his resources to usurp power in the city of Gotham and institute a police state in which he exercises hegemonic control over the city's population. Anarky becomes a resistance leader, undermining the centers of Batman's power and ultimately overthrowing Bruce Wayne's tyranny. The story ends with a quote by Mikhail Bakunin: \"(For reasons of the state) black becomes white and white becomes black, the horrible becomes humane and the most dastardly felonies and atrocious crimes become meritorious acts.\" During the early years of the character's development, virtually no writers other than Grant used Anarky in DC publications. In the singular portrayal by an author other than Grant during this period, writer Kevin Dooley used Anarky in an issue of \"Green Arrow\", producing an explicitly anti-firearm themed story. Throughout the narrative, dialogue between Anarky and Green Arrow conveys the need for direct action, as Anarky attempts to persuade Oliver Queen to sympathize with militant, economic sabotage in pursuit of social justice.\n\nLiterary cues illustrated into scenes were occasionally used whenever Anarky was a featured character in a comic. During the Anarky limited series, fluttering newspapers were used to bear headlines alluding to social problems. Occasionally, the titles of books found in Anarky's room would express the character's philosophical, political, or generally esoteric agenda. In both \"Detective Comics\" No.620 and \"\" No.40, a copy of \"V for Vendetta\" can be seen on Lonnie Machin's bookshelf as homage. Other books in his room at different times have included \"Apostles of Revolution\" by Max Nomad, \"The Anarchists\" by James Joll, books labeled \"\"Proudhon\" and \"Bakunin\"\", and an issue of \"Black Flag\". Non-anarchist material included books labeled \"\"Plato\", \"Aristotle\", and \"Swedenborg\"\", and a copy of \"Synergetics\", by Buckminster Fuller. The character also made references to \"Universe\" by Scudder Klyce, an extremely rare book. When asked if he was concerned readers would be unable to follow some of the more obscure literary references, Grant explained that he hadn't expected many to do so, but reported encountering some who had, and that one particular reader of the 1999 \"Anarky\" series had carried out an ongoing correspondence with him on the topic as of 2005.\n\nOver the course of several years, Grant's political opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market based philosophies. Grant later speculated that this transformation would be detectable within stories he'd written. By 1997, Grant's philosophy settled on Neo-Tech, which was developed by Frank R. Wallace, and when given the opportunity to write an \"Anarky\" miniseries, he decided to redesign the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. \"I felt he was the perfect character\" to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, \"because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness\". This new characterization was continued in the 1999 \"Anarky\" ongoing series.\n\nThe limited and ongoing series were both heavily influenced by Neo-Tech, despite the term never appearing in a single issue. New emphasis was placed on previously unexplored themes, such as the depiction of Anarky as an atheist and a rationalist. Grant also expressed a desire to use the comic as a vehicle for his thoughts concerning the mind and consciousness, and made bicameralism a major theme of both series. While this trend led the character away from the philosophies he had espoused previously, the primary theme of the character remained anti-statism. In one issue of the 1999 series, a character asked what the nature of Anarky's politics were. The response was that Anarky was neither right-wing, nor left-wing, and that he \"transcends the political divide\". Grant has specified that he categorized Anarky politically as an anarchist who \"tried to put anarchist values into action.\" Norm Breyfogle also stated in 1999 that the character represented anarchist philosophy, but said in 2003 that he believed the Neo-Tech influence allowed Anarky to be classified as an objectivist.\n\nGrant developed Anarky as a gadgeteer—a character who relies on inventions and gadgets to compensate for a lack of superpowers—and as a child prodigy. In early incarnations he was portrayed as highly intelligent, but inexperienced. Lacking in many skills, he survived largely by his ingenuity. In accordance with this, he would occasionally quote the maxim, \"the essence of anarchy is surprise\". By 1991 a profile of the character, following the introduction of Anarky's skills as a hacker in the \"Rite of Passage\" storyline of \"Detective Comics\" No.620, described that \"Lonnie's inventive genius is equaled only by his computer wizardry.\"\n\nAnarky's abilities were increased during the character's two eponymous series, being portrayed as having enormous talents in both engineering and computer technology, as well as prodigiously developing skills in martial arts. This was indicated in several comics published just before the \"Anarky\" miniseries, and later elaborated upon within the series itself.\n\nDescribed as physically frail in comparison to the adults he opposes, the character often utilizes cunning, improvisation, and intelligence as tools for victory. During the saga, the character states, \"The essence of anarchy is \"surprise\" – spontaneous action ... even when it does require a little \"planning\"!\"\n\nEarly descriptions of the character's gadgets focused on low-tech, improvised tools and munitions, such as flare guns, swing lines, throwing stars, small spherical shelled explosives with burning fuses (mimicking round mortar bombs stereotypically associated with 19th-century anarchists), gas-bombs, smoke bombs, and his primary weapon, a powerful electric stun baton shaped as a golden cane.\n\nAs a wanted criminal, Anarky's methods and goals were described as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, or the public at large, relegating him to underground operation. When in need of assistance, he would call on the help of the homeless community in Gotham who had supported him since his first appearance.\n\nAnarky was described as having developed skills as a computer hacker to steal enormous sums of money from various corporations in his second appearance, part of the \"Rite of Passage\" storyline in \"Detective Comics\" No.620. This addition to the character's skill set made him the second major hacker in the DC Universe, being preceded by Barbara Gordon's debut as \"Oracle\", and was quickly adapted by 1992 to allow the character to gain information on other heroes and villains from police computer networks.\n\nAccording to Alan Grant, the urgency with which Anarky views his cause has necessitated that the character forsake any social life, and increase his abilities drastically over the years. \"The kid's whole life is dedicated to self-improvement,\" wrote Grant for the \"Batman: Anarky\" introduction, \"with the sole aim of destroying the parasitic elites who he considers feast off ordinary folks.\" A review of the first issue of the 1999 series described Anarky as akin to a \"Batman Jr.\" The reviewer continued, \"[Grant] writes Lonnie like a teenager who is head and shoulders above the rest of the population, but still a kid.\"\n\nIn 1995, Grant used the two part \"Anarky\" storyline in \"Batman: Shadow of the Bat\" to alter the character's status quo in several ways that would reach their fruition in the first \"Anarky\" series. To accomplish this feat, several plot devices were used to increase Lonnie's abilities. To justify the character's financial independence, Anarky was described as using the internet to earn money through his online bookstore, \"Anarco\", which he used as a front company to propagate his philosophy. A second front organization, \"The Anarkist Foundation\", was also developed to offer grants to radical causes he supports. A \"Biofeedback Learning Enhancer\" was employed to increase Lonnie's abilities. The cybernetic device was described as being capable of amplifying brain functions by a multiple of ten. Anarky was also described as having begun to train in martial arts, following the character's time in juvenile hall.\n\nThe 1997 \"Anarky\" limited series saw the earlier plot devices of the preceding \"Anarky\" storyline become narrative justifications for drastically upgraded skill sets. Anarky's earlier brain augmentation was now described as having \"fused\" the hemispheres of his brain, in a reference to bicameralism. Meanwhile, the character's business enterprises were said to have gained him millions of dollars in the dot-com bubble. The character's combat abilities were described as having progressed remarkably, and to have included training in multiple styles which he \"integrated\" into a hybrid fighting style. Even the character's primary stun baton weapon was enhanced, with a grappling hook incorporated into the walking stick itself to allow dual functionality.\n\nWith this enhanced intelligence and financial assets, the 1999 ongoing series narrates that Anarky went on to create an on-board AI computer, MAX (\"Multi-Augmented X-Program\"); a crude but fully functioning teleportation device capable of summoning a boom tube, and secretly excavated an underground base below the Washington Monument. Portrayed as an atheist by Grant, Anarky espoused the belief that \"science is magic explained\", and was shown to use scientific analysis to explain and manipulate esoteric forces of magic and energy. Anarky's skill in software cracking was further increased to allow him to tap into Batman's supercomputer, and the Justice League Watchtower.\n\nThis evolution in Anarky's abilities was criticized as having overpowered the character in a \"Fanzing\" review of the \"Anarky\" ongoing series. The rapid development was seen as preventing the suspension of disbelief in the young character's adventures, which was said to have contributed to the failure of the series. This view stood in contrast with that of Breyfogle, who considered Anarky's heightened skill set to be a complementary feature, and contended that Anarky's advanced abilities lent uniqueness to the character. Breyfogle wrote, \"Anarky's singularity is due partly to his being, at his age, nearly as competent as Batman.\"\n\nIn Fabian Niciza's stories for \"Red Robin\", Lonnie Machin's abilities as Moneyspider were revamped, with the character taking on the persona of an \"electronic ghost.\" Comatose, Moneyspider was free to act through his mind via connections to the internet, and interacted with others via text messaging and a speech synthesizer. In this condition, he acts to \"create an international web that will [access] the ins and outs of criminal and corporate operations.\" Within virtual reality, the character's augmented intelligence was described as a \"fused bicameral mind\", able to maintain a presence online at all times, while another part of his mind separately interacted with others offline.\n\nAnarky's costume has undergone several phases in design, the first two of which were created by Norm Breyfogle, in accordance with Grant's suggestions.\nThe original costume was composed of a large, flowing red robe, over a matching red jumpsuit. A red, wide brimmed hat baring the circle-A insignia; a golden, metallic face mask; and red hood, completed the outfit. The folds of the robe concealed various weapons and gadgets. Breyfogle later expressed that the color scheme chosen held symbolic purpose. The red robes \"represented the blood of all the innocents sacrificed in war.\" The gold cane, face mask, and circle-A symbol represented purity and spirituality. The connection to spirituality was also emphasized through the hat and loose fabric, which mimicked that of a priest. Breyfogle believed the loose clothes \"[went] better with a wide-brimmed hat. It's more of a colloquial style of clothing ...\" However, observers have noted that Breyfogle's Christian upbringing may have also inspired the \"priestly analogy.\"\n\nThis costume was also designed to disguise Anarky's height, and so included a \"head extender\" under his hood, which elongated his neck. This design was also intended to create a subtle awkwardness that the reader would subconsciously suspect as being fake, until the reveal at the end of Anarky's first appearance. Despite the revelation of this false head, which would no longer serve its intended purpose at misdirecting the reader, the head extender was included in several return appearances, while at irregular times other artists drew the character without the extender. This discontinuity in the character's design ended when Breyfogle finally eliminated this aspect of the character during the 1997 limited series, expressing that the character's height growth had ended its usefulness. In reality, Breyfogle's decision was also as a result of the difficulty the design presented, being \"awkward [to draw] in action situations.\"\n\nAnarky's second costume was used during the 1999 ongoing \"Anarky\" series. It retained the red jumpsuit, gold mask, and hat, but excised the character's red robes. New additions to the costume included a red cape, a utility belt modeled after Batman's utility belt, and a single, large circle-A across the chest, akin to Superman's iconic \"S\" shield. The golden mask was also redesigned as a reflective, but flexible material that wrapped around Anarky's head, allowing for the display of facial movement and emotion. This had previously been impossible, as the first mask was made of inflexible metal. Being a relatively new creation, Breyfogle encountered no editorial resistance in the new character design: \"Because [Anarky] doesn't have 50 years of merchandising behind him, I can change his costume whenever I want ...\" Within the \"Anarky\" series, secondary costumes were displayed in Anarky's base of operations. Each was slightly altered in design, but followed the same basic theme of color, jumpsuit, cloak, and hat. These were designed for use in various situations, but only one, a \"universal battle suit\", was used during the brief series. These suits were also intended to be seen in the unpublished ninth issue of the series.\n\nIn 2005, James Peaty's \"Green Arrow\" story, \"Anarky in the USA\", featured a return to some of the costume elements used prior to the \"Anarky\" series. Drawn by Eric Battle, the circle-A chest icon was removed in favor of a loose fabric jumpsuit completed with a flowing cape. The flexible mask was replaced with the previous, unmoving metallic mask, but illustrated with a new reflective quality. This design element was used at times to reflect the face of someone Anarky looked at, creating a mirroring of a person's emotions upon Anarky's own mask. This same effect was later reused in two issues of \"Red Robin\". For the usurpation of the \"Anarky\" mantle by Ulysses Armstrong, Freddie Williams II illustrated a new costume design for Armstrong that featured several different design elements. While retaining the primary colors of gold and red, the traditional hat was replaced with a hood, and a new three-piece cuirass with shoulder guards and leather belt was added. The mask was also altered from an expressionless visage to a menacing grimace. This design was later re-illustrated by Marcus To in the \"Red Robin\" series, but with a new color scheme in which red was replaced with black.\n\nIn attempting to present the character as a figurative mirror to Batman, the costume worn by Anarky in \"Beware the Batman\" was radically redesigned as entirely white, in contrast to Batman's black Batsuit. It consists of a tightly worn jumpsuit, cape, hood, flexible mask with white-eye lenses, and a utility belt. Upon the chest is a small, stylized circle-A in black. The design was negatively compared by reviewers to the longstanding design for Moon Knight, a Marvel Comics superhero.\n\nThe costume redesign for Anarky in \"Batman: Arkham Origins\", while stylized, attempted to thematically highlight the character's anarchist sentiments by updating his appearance utilizing black bloc iconography. Donning a red puffer flight jacket, hoodie and cargo pants, the character sported gold accents decorating his black belt, backpack and combat boots, and completed this with an orange bandana wrapped below his neck. His metallic mask was replaced with a white theatrical stage mask, evocative of the Guy Fawkes mask made popular among protesters by \"V for Vendetta\" and Anonymous. The jacket is itself emblazoned with a painted circle-A. \"He looks like a street protester in our game,\" commented Eric Holmes, the creative director of the game, \"and there's no accident to that.\" This design was later used as model for a DC Collectibles figure, released as part of a series based on villains featured in the game.\n\nIn the years that followed the creation of Anarky, both Norm Breyfogle and Alan Grant experienced changes in their personal and professional lives which they attributed to that collaboration. Each man acknowledged the primary impact of the character to have been on their mutual friendship and intellectual understanding. In particular, their time developing the \"Anarky\" series led to a working relationship centered on esoteric debate, discussion, and mutual respect.\n\nOver time, Anarky emerged as each man's favorite character, with Grant wishing he could emulate the character, and remarking that \"Anarky in Gotham City\" was the most personal story he had ever written, and the foremost among his three favorite stories he had ever written for the Batman mythos. Of Breyfogle, Grant complimented that the former \"draws Anarky as if he loves the character.\" While Breyfogle acknowledged that Anarky was his favorite of the creations they collaborated on, he felt that his own appreciation was not as great as Grant's, commenting that Anarky was \"Alan's baby\".\n\nWith the cancellation of the Anarky series, and the eventual departure of each artist from DC Comicsfirst by Grant, followed by Breyfogletheir mutual career paths split, and Anarky entered into a period of obscurity. During this period, Breyfogle came to suspect that the treatment each man, and Anarky, had received from their former employer was suspect. While acknowledging that he lacked evidence, he held a \"nagging feeling\" that he and Grant had each been \"blacklisted\" from DC Comics as a result of the controversial views expressed in the \"Anarky\" series' second volume.\n\nWhile professing that Anarky was the character for whom he was proudest, and that the character's narratives were among his best achievements for the amount of reaction they generated among readers, the character was also a source of some regret for Grant. Reflecting on his early secret plan to transform Lonnie Machin into a new Robin, Grant has stated that though he came to appreciate the character of Tim Drake, he occasionally experiences \"twinges of regret that Anarky wasn’t chosen as the new sidekick for comics' greatest hero.\" Grant has also stated that he attempted to distance himself from the direction of Anarky following his termination from DC Comics, and actively tried to avoid learning about the fate of Anarky and other characters he had come to care about. He often found himself disappointed to see how some characters were used or, as he felt, were mismanaged. Grant later joked on his disillusion in the handling of Anarky, \"if you create something that's close to your heart and you don't own it, 'Oh woe is me!'\" In 2011, DC Comics initiated a special \"DC Retroactive\" series of comics, exploring different periods in the publication history of popular characters. Both Grant and Breyfogle were invited to participate, and collaborated to reproduce a story in the style of their classic \"Batman: Shadow of the Bat\" series. Grant chose to author a story featuring the Ventriloquist. However, he had been tempted to author a story featuring Anarky, only reconsidering the idea on the basis that his disassociation from the character had left him unfamiliar with what had become of Anarky's canonical status at the time.\n\nAs Anarky was created while Grant and Breyfogle were operating under \"work-for-hire\" rules, DC Comics owns all rights to the Anarky character. Following the cancellation of the \"Anarky\" series, both men attempted to buy the rights to Anarky from the company, but their offer was declined.\n\nWhen an interviewer commented that Anarky was popular among fans in 2003, in the midst of the character's period of obscurity, Norm Breyfogle offered a caveat: \"Well, in certain segments of the comic book industry, I suppose.\" Breyfogle continued, \"It has some diehard fans. But, DC doesn't seem to want to do anything with him. Maybe it's because of his anti-authoritarian philosophy, a very touchy subject in today's world.\"\n\nThe sense that Anarky is appreciated by certain fans is one shared by Alan Grant, who noted that the character's stories routinely generated more reader mail than any other he wrote. Commenting on the popularity of the \"Anarky\" series, Grant acknowledged the failure of the series, but pointed out that it was very popular among some readers: \"It wasn't terribly popular in the States, although I received quite a few letters (especially from philosophy students) saying the comic had changed their entire mindset. But Anarky was very popular in South America, where people have had a long and painful taste of totalitarianism, in a way the US is just entering.\"\n\nSales of the \"Anarky\" limited series were high enough to green light an ongoing series, with Breyfogle commenting, \"[it] did well enough so that DC is willing to listen to Alan’s idea for a sequel if we wanted to pitch them.\" However, despite the sales, Grant was still concerned the character lacked enough support among fans to sustain an ongoing series. While the ongoing series did find an audience amongst Latin American nations—Mexico and Argentina in particular—it failed in the United States, where Alan Grant has lamented that the comic was doomed to eventual cancellation, as DC Comics \"[doesn't] take foreign sales into consideration when counting their cash\".\n\nAcknowledging the failure of the ongoing \"Anarky\" series, Grant has conceded that its themes, in particular his interest in exploring esoteric concepts such as philosophy of mind, likely resulted in \"plummeting\" sales. Breyfogle claimed the difficulty of combining escapist entertainment with social commentary as his explanation for the series' failure. Breyfogle wrote at the time: \"\"Anarky\" is a hybrid of the mainstream and the not-quite-so-mainstream. This title may have experienced exactly what every 'half-breed' suffers: rejection by both groups with which it claims identity.\" Besides the themes, commentators have also found the escalation of Anarky's skills and special heroics as a source of criticism among readers. \"I liked the original concept behind Anarky: a teenage geek who reads \"The Will to Power\" one too many times and decides to go out and fix the world,\" wrote a critic for \"Fanzing\", an online newsletter produced by comic book fans and professionals. \"But the minute he wound up getting $100 million in a Swiss Bank account, owning a building, impressing Darksied, getting a Boom Tube and was shown as being able to outsmart Batman, outhack Oracle and generally be invincible, I lost all interest I had in the character.\"\n\nIn 2014, Comic Book Resources held an informal poll which asked readers to vote for the best characters within the Batman franchise, in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the 1939 creation of \"the Caped Crusader\". Anarky was placed at No. 31 among the best villains, coming nearly 25 years after the character's own creation.\n\nThe philosophical nature of the character has invited political critiques, and resulted in comparisons drawn against the political and philosophical views of other fictional characters. Of the various positive analyses drawn from Anarky, two points which are continuously touched upon by critics are that Anarky is among the most unusual of Batman's rogue gallery, and that his challenge to the ideologies of superheroes is his best feature.\n\nThe authors of \"I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise\", a 1991 essay deconstructing the Batman mythos, refer to Anarky as a challenge to Batman's social and political world view, and to the political position indirectly endorsed by the themes of a Batman adventure. As the Batman mythos is centered on themes of retribution and the protection of property rights, the invitation to readers to identify with Batman's vigilantism is an invitation to adopt political authoritarianism. The authors summarize that position as \"the inviolability of property relations and the justification of their defense by any means necessary (short of death).\" However, the authors contend that Anarky \"potentially redefines crime\" and invites the reader to identify with a new political position in favor of the disenfranchised, which Batman \"can not utterly condemn\". The authors contend that the creation of Anarky and dialogue by other characters represented a shift towards \"self-conscious awareness of the Batman's hegemonic function, questioning the most central component of the Batman's identity—the nature of crime and his relation to it.\" However, the authors remain skeptical of Anarky's commercial nature, pointing out Anarky could be \"incorporated as another marketing technique [...] The contradictions of capitalism would thus permit the commodification of criticisms as long as they resulted in profits.\"\n\nWith the publication in 2005 of an issue of \"Green Arrow\" in which Anarky guest-starred, writer James Peaty juxtaposed Anarky's radical philosophy with the liberal progressive beliefs of Green Arrow: \"Everyone always goes on about what a radical Ollie is and I wanted to show that maybe that isn't the case ... especially as Ollie's radical credentials are pretty antiquated ... Anarky as a character—and as a broader idea—is much more radical than Ollie.\"\n\nGreg Burgas, of \"Comic Book Resources\", critiqued Anarky as \"one of the more interesting characters of the past fifteen or twenty years [...] because of what he wants to accomplish...\" Burgas continued, comparing the nature of Anarky as a change agent against Batman: \"He is able to show how ineffective Batman is against the real problems of society, and although Batman stops his spree, we find ourselves sympathizing much more with Anarky than with the representative of the status quo.\"\n\nAnarky's appearance in \"Batman: Arkham Origins\" included a speech delivered at the conclusion of the character's story arch. The player is given the opportunity to observe Anarky after he has been defeated, and watch as the teenager enters a monologue in which he laments the downfall of society, tries to reconcile his admiration for Batman, and ultimately denounces the Caped Crusader as a false hero. Nick Dinicola of PopMatters, in comparing the game to its predecessor, \"Batman: Arkham City\", asserted that the narrative of \"Origins\" consistently challenged Batman's ideological reasons for acting as he does, whereas \"City\" uncritically took his motivations as a given. \"Anarky’s wonderful speech takes Batman to task for the contradictions in his symbolism,\" writes Dinicola, choosing that moment in the game as one of several examples of this theme. \"Considering that Batman is very explicitly a symbol of fear, Anarky is equating the rise of Batman with the downfall of society.\" Dinicola was also of the opinion that the willingness to use characters like Anarky to scrutinize Batman's heroism, rather than simply assert it, allowed the game to ultimately prove and uphold Batman as a heroic figure in a way \"City\" could not. To Dinicola, this validated the act of challenging a superhero's traditional interpretation in service to the story.\n\nIn \"Batman and Philosophy\", an analysis of various philosophies which intersect with the Batman mythos, Anarky's critique of the state is compared favorably to that of Friedrich Nietzsche: \"The Nietzschean state constitutes a 'new idol,' one that is no less repressive than its predecessors, as it defines good and evil for, and hangs a 'sword and a hundred appetites' over, the faithful. No Batman villain sees this as clearly as Anarky ...\" However, Anarky's behavior was also interpreted as an attempt to impose an even more restrictive order, with examples presented from \"Batman: Anarky\", in which Lonnie Machin lectures fellow juvenile detainees in \"Tomorrow Belongs to Us\", explains his motivations in a self-righteous farewell letter to his parents in \"Anarky\", and creates a fantasy dystopia in a distorted reflection of his desired society in \"Metamorphosis\": \"His [Anarky's] search for an organizing principle that is less repressive than the state fails.\" This is sharply compared with Batman, described as moderating his impulses towards social control. Dialogue from \"Detective Comics\" is employed, in which Batman compares himself to Anarky and denies the latter legitimacy: \"The fact is, no man can be allowed to set himself up as judge, jury and executioner.\"\n\nFar less favorable views of Anarky have also been offered. Newsarama contributor George Marston was especially scathing of the character's politics and costume, placing Anarky at No.8 on a list of the \"Top 10 Worst Batman villains of all time.\" Deriding the character as a \"living embodiment of an Avril Lavigne t-shirt\", he pointed out the pointlessness of being inspired to super heroics by radical philosophy, and the contradictory nature of fighting crime as an anarchist. He concluded by referring to the unsuccessful \"Anarky\" series as proof that \"bad decisions are timeless\". Similarly, Cracked contributor Henrik Magnusson listed Anarky's debut at No.3 on a list of \"5 Disastrous Attempts at Political Commentary in Comic Books.\" Magnusson's scorn focused on Anarky's poorly written speeches, which he derided as \"pedantic\" and laden with \"pseudo-philosophical catchphrases.\" Referring to the original identity of Lonnie Machin as a \"naive pre-teen\", Magnusson considered this fine satire of \"base-level philosophy\" and teen rebellion. However, the understanding that Grant had intended Anarky to be a vehicle for his personal views, and that the \"Anarky in Gotham City\" narrative describes Batman as sympathetic to his goals, if not his methods, upset Magnusson.\n\nSeveral global events of the early 2010s included the rise of hacktivist groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec; large scale protest movements, including the Arab Spring, Occupy movement, and Quebec student protests; the crypto-anarchist activity on the part of Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson; and the various information leaks to WikiLeaks by Chelsea Manning, the Stratfor email leak by Anonymous and Jeremy Hammond, and the global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden. The rapid succession of these events led some media commentators to insist that Anarky's relevance as a character had dramatically increased, and recommended that the character receive a higher profile in media. This sentiment led the creative team that developed \"Batman: Arkham Origins\" to include Anarky in the game. Describing Anarky's anti-government and anti-corporate agenda, Holmes acknowledged the relevance of anarchism in the contemporary protest movements of the time as a factor in the choice to include the character in the game, and to update his appearance to that of a street protester with a gang resembling a social movement. Holmes stressed in one interview, \"In the real world, this is Anarky's moment. Right now. Today.\" Even as early as 2005, James Peaty recommended that Anarky should be included in more publications in the midst of the ongoing War on Terror, stating \"Anarky is a terrorist! How can that not be interesting in the modern climate?\"\n\nCritics have commented on the character's depiction as an anarchist since his first appearance. According to Alan Grant, anarchists with whom he associated were angered by his creation of the character, seeing it as an act of recuperation for commercial gain. Neither Grant nor Breyfogle could fully agree with this criticism. As Grant put it, \"I thought I was doing them a favour you know?\"\n\nIn the years following the \"Anarky\" publications of the late 1990s, more receptive critiques have been offered. In assessing the presentation of anarchist philosophy in fiction, Mark Leier, the director for the Centre for Labour Studies from Simon Fraser University, cited Anarky as an example of the favorable treatment anarchist philosophy has occasionally received in mainstream comic books. Leier took particular note of quotations derived from the dialogue in \"Anarky in Gotham City\" story, in which Batman speaks positively of Anarky's intentions. Following the cancellation of the ongoing series, Roderick T. Long, an anarchist/libertarian political commentator and Senior Scholar at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, praised Anarky as \"an impressive voice for liberty in today's comics\". Margaret Killjoy's examination of anarchist fiction, \"Mythmakers & Lawbreakers\", afforded Alan Grant and Anarky brief mention. Explaining the relationship Grant had with anarchism, Killjoy reviewed the characters' early incarnations as \"quite wonderful.\"\n\nGreg Burgas, in reviewing the career of Alan Grant, specifically cited Anarky's anarchist philosophy as one of the character's most empathetic traits. Lamenting the obscurity of the character, Burgas wished Anarky and anarchism would be presented more often: \"... anarchy as a concept is often dismissed, but it's worth looking at simply because it is so radical and untenable yet noble.\"\n\nAs a lesser known character in the DC Universe, Anarky has a smaller library of associated comic books and significant story lines than more popular DC Comics characters. Between 1989 and 1996, Anarky was primarily written by Alan Grant in Batman-related comics, received a guest appearance in a single issue of \"Green Arrow\" by Kevin Dooley, and was given an entry in \"Who's Who in the DC Universe\".\n\nIn the late 1990s, Anarky entered a brief period of minor prominence; first with the publication of the first \"Anarky\" volume in 1997; followed in 1998 with the \"\" collection; and in 1999, with featured appearances in both \"DCU Heroes Secret Files and Origins\" #1, and the second \"Anarky\" series. After the cancellation of the ongoing series, Anarky lapsed into obscurity lasting approximately nine years. This ambiguous condition was not complete, as Anarky was sporadically used during this time. These appearances include marginal cameos in issues of \"Young Justice\", \"Wonder Woman\", and \"Green Arrow\".\n\nAnarky made an appearance in a 2008 issue of \"Robin\" as part of an effort to return the character to regular publication, and became a recurring cast member in the \"Red Robin\" series in November 2010, until the series was cancelled in October 2011.\n\nLesser known among the cast of characters in the DC universe, Anarky went unused for adaptations to other media platforms throughout much of the character's existence. However, in 2013 the character was chosen to recur in \"Beware the Batman\", an animated series on Cartoon Network, voiced by Wallace Langham. Anarky debuted in the third episode, \"Tests\", and appeared in seven total episodes of the series before its cancellation. Later that year, Anarky was also included in the Batman video game, \"\", voiced by Matthew Mercer, and \"\". Lonnie Machin made his live action debut in 2016, during the fourth season of \"Arrow\", in a villainous adaptation portrayed by Alexander Calvert.\n\n. \"52\" was promoted as a comic that would attempt to incorporate as many DC Comics characters as possible. In a Q&A session hosted by Newsarama.com, \"52\" editor Michael Siglain answered a series of questions regarding which characters fans wanted to see in the series. Question No.19 asked \"We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52. Could you please tell us when we can expect his appearances?\" Siglain's simple response to readers was, \"check back in the late 40s.\" Speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue No.48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication. On the cover, the circle-A could be seen as a minor element in the background. In a review for \"Week 48\", \"Major Spoilers\" considered the absence of Anarky a drawback: \"It's too bad we didn't see the return of Anarky as hinted by this week's cover\" Pop culture critic, Douglas Wolk, wrote, \"I guess this issue's cover is the closest we're going to get to Anarky after all (and by proxy as close as we're going to get to the Haunted Tank). Too bad.\"\n. The 1990 \"Detective Comics\" #620 story, \"Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero\", chronicles Tim Drake's first solo detective case, as he pursues an online investigation against an advanced grey hat computer hacker. The unknown hacker, operating under the alias \"Moneyspider\", has stolen millions of dollars from western corporations, including Wayne Enterprises, outmaneuvering Batman's own data security in the process. He is revealed by Drake to be Lonnie Machin by the end of the issue. This functioned as the antecedent for Fabian Nicieza's reintroduction of Machin under the name \"Moneyspider\" in 2008.\n. As a result of the increased renown the character gained from this appearance, speculation that Anarky would reappear in the \"\" franchise simmered in the lead up to the release of \"\", with commentators predicting that the enigmatic \"Arkham Knight\" character would be revealed to be Anarky in adult form.\n. In warning readers to avoid spoiling potential surprises for their experience in playing \"\", Eric Holmes specifically referenced the Wikipedia article on the character as a resource to avoid: \"You know what? If you want to enjoy the game, don't bother reading up on him, because there are a few surprises about him which will turn up in the game, and if you go read Wikipedia or something like that, it'll rob you a little bit on some of the stuff in the game, because there are some surprises about Anarky.\"\n. Following Anarky's debut in \"Anarky in Gotham City\", the character's design incorporated the head extender in \"Robin Annual\" #1 (1992), \"Green Arrow\" #89 (August 1994), and \"The Batman Adventures\" #31 (April 1995). The head extender was not included in \"Batman: Shadow of The Bat\" #18 (October 1993), and \"The Batman Chronicles\" #1 (Summer, 1995).\n"}
{"id": "46313213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46313213", "title": "Anthony Ray Hinton", "text": "Anthony Ray Hinton\n\nAnthony Ray Hinton (born June 1, 1956) is a black man from Alabama who was wrongly convicted of the 1985 murders of two fast food restaurant managers in Birmingham, sentenced to death, and held on the state's death row for 28 years.\n\nIn 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously overturned his conviction on appeal, and the state dropped all charges against him. It was unable to affirm the forensic evidence of a gun, which was the only evidence in the first trial.\n\nAfter being released, Hinton wrote and published a memoir \"The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and Freedom on Death Row\" (2018).\n\nOn 25 February and 2 July 1985, two fast food managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vasona, were killed in separate incidents during armed robberies at their restaurants in Birmingham. A survivor of a third restaurant robbery picked a photo of Anthony Ray Hinton, then age 29, from a lineup, and the police investigated him. He worked at a supermarket warehouse and lived with his mother Buhlar Hinton at her home in rural Alabama, about a half hour north of Birmingham. \n\nAfter Hinton's arrest, his public defense attorney did not provide adequate counsel. He said to Hinton, \"All of y'all Blacks always say you didn’t do something.\" The credibility of his ballistics expert, who was the only one the attorney thought he could hire with funds available, was torn apart by the prosecutor because of physical limitations and lack of experience. The jury disregarded the testimony of Hinton's boss, who testified that he was at work at the time of the alleged crimes. \n\nThe prosecution's only evidence at the trial was a statement that ballistics tests showed four crime scene bullets matched Hinton's mother's gun, which was discovered at her house during the investigation. No fingerprints or eyewitness testimony were introduced. Hinton was convicted of each of the two murders and sentenced to death.\n\nHe was sent to death row, which meant that he was held in solitary confinement for nearly three decades. During his decades in prison, he was supported by his mother's unwavering faith in his innocence, as well as that of a longtime friend, Lester Bailey, who visited him monthly. His mother died in 2002. \n\nWhile on death row, Hinton began to read a lot. He eventually organized a book club that was allowed to meet in the prison's law library. Among the authors whom the prisoners read and discussed were James Baldwin and Harper Lee. Finally Hinton was the last prisoner left on death row.\n\nHinton's initial appeals continued to be handled by his public defender, who lost each case. After Hinton had been on death row about a decade, the Equal Justice Initiative (a non-profit based in Montgomery, Alabama), picked up his case, handling his defense for 16 years. During the appeals, EJI introduced evidence from three forensics experts, including one from the FBI, showing that the bullets from the crime scenes did not match Hinton's mother's gun. But the state court of Alabama refused to overturn his convictions or grant a new trial.\n\nResponding to an appeal that reached the US Supreme Court in 2014, the Court ruled that Hinton's original defense lawyer was \"constitutionally deficient\", and remanded his case to the lower court for retrial. Hinton's defense lawyer had wrongly thought he had only $1,000 available to hire a ballistics expert to rebut the state’s case on evidence. The only expert willing to testify at that price was a civil engineer with little ballistics training and limited by having one eye; he admitted in court to having trouble in operating the microscope.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, on April 1, 2015 the Jefferson County district attorney’s office moved to drop the case. Their forensics experts were unable to match crime-scene bullets to Hinton's mother's gun. Prosecutors admitted that they could not match four bullets found at the crime scene with Hinton's gun, and that this was the only evidence offered in the original murder trial.\n\nOn April 3, 2015, Hinton was released from prison after Laura Petro, Jefferson County Circuit judge, overturned his conviction and the state dropped all charges against him.\n\nHinton is the 152nd person since 1973 to be exonerated from death row in the United States, and the sixth in the state of Alabama. He said, “Everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God.” Hinton filed a claim for nearly $1.5 million in compensation for his time in jail due to wrongful conviction. The legislature has resisted approval of this payment, as state authorities say that he did not prove his innocence.\n\nSince his release, Hinton has spoken in various venues about the injustices of the Alabama judicial system and other issues related to his conviction and imprisonment. He completed a memoir entitled \"The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and Freedom on Death Row\" (2018), and has given readings and talks about the book and his experiences around the country.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6526", "title": "Cassandra", "text": "Cassandra\n\nCassandra or Kassandra (Ancient Greek: Κασσάνδρα, , also ), also known as Alexandra, was a daughter of King Priam and of Queen Hecuba of Troy in Greek mythology.\n\nCassandra was cursed to utter prophecies that were true but that no one believed. The older and most common versions state that she was admired by the god Apollo, and he offered her the gift to see the future in order to win her heart. Cassandra agreed to be his lover in return to his gift, but after receiving the gift, she went back on her word and refused him. Apollo was angered that she lied to and deceived him, but since he couldn't take back a gift already given, he cursed her that though she would see the future accurately, nobody would ever believe her prophecies. \n\nSome of the later versions have her falling asleep in a temple, where snakes licked (or whispered in) her ears so that she could hear the future.\n\nCassandra became a figure of epic tradition and of tragedy.\n\nIn modern usage her name is employed as a rhetorical device to indicate someone whose accurate prophecies are not believed by those around them.\n\nHjalmar Frisk (\"Griechisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch\", Heidelberg, 1960–1970) notes \"unexplained etymology\", citing \"various hypotheses\" found in Wilhelm Schulze, Edgar Howard Sturtevant, J. Davreux, and . R. S. P. Beekes cites García Ramón's derivation of the name from the Proto-Indo-European root *\"(s)kend-\" \"raise\".\n\nCassandra was a princess of Troy, the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba and the fraternal twin sister of Helenus. According to legend, Cassandra had dark brown curly hair and dark brown eyes, and was both beautiful and clever, but considered insane.\n\nCassandra was given the gift of prophecy, but was also cursed by the god Apollo so that her accurate prophecies would not be believed. Many versions of the myth relate that she incurred the god's wrath by refusing him sex, after promising herself to him in exchange for the power of prophecy. In Aeschylus' \"Agamemnon\", she bemoans her relationship with Apollo:\n<poem>Apollo, Apollo!\nGod of all ways, but only Death's to me,\nOnce and again, O thou, Destroyer named,\nThou hast destroyed me, thou, my love of old!</poem>\n\nAnd she acknowledges her fault\n<poem>\"... I consented to Loxias (Apollo) but broke my word... Ever since that fault I could persuade no one of anything.\"</poem>\n\nHyginus in Fabulae says:\nIn some versions of the myth, Apollo curses her by spitting into her mouth.\n\nCassandra had served as a priestess of Apollo and taken a sacred vow of chastity to remain a virgin for her entire life.\n\nHer cursed gift from Apollo became a source of endless pain and frustration to Cassandra. She was seen as a liar and a madwoman by her family and by the Trojan people. In some versions of the story, she was often locked up in a pyramidal building on the citadel on the orders of her father, King Priam. She was accompanied there by the wardress, who cared for her under orders to inform the King of all of his daughter's \"prophetic utterances\".\n\nAccording to legend, Cassandra had instructed her twin brother Helenus in the power of prophecy so he could be a prophet. Like her, Helenus was always correct whenever he had made his predictions, but unlike his sister, people believed him.\n\nCassandra made many predictions, and all of her prophecies were disbelieved except for one, when she foresaw who Paris was and proclaimed that he was her abandoned brother. Cassandra foresaw that Paris’ abduction of Helen for his wife would bring about the Trojan War and warned Paris not to go to Sparta. Helenus echoed her prophecy, but his warnings were ignored. Cassandra saw Helen coming into Troy when Paris returned home from Sparta. Cassandra furiously snatched away Helen's golden veil and tore at her hair, for she had foreseen that Helen's arrival would bring the calamities of the Trojan War and the destruction of Troy. The Trojan people, however, welcomed Helen into their city.\n\nCassandra foresaw the destruction of Troy. In various accounts of the war, she warned the Trojans about the Greeks hiding inside the Trojan Horse, Agamemnon's death, her own demise at the hands of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra, her mother Hecuba's fate, Odysseus's ten-year wanderings before returning to his home, and the murder of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra by the latter's children Electra and Orestes. Cassandra predicted that her cousin Aeneas would escape during the fall of Troy and found a new nation in Rome. However, she was unable to do anything to forestall these tragedies since no one believed her.\n\nCoroebus and Othronus came to the aid of Troy during the Trojan War out of love for Cassandra and in exchange for her hand in marriage, but both were killed. According to one account, Priam offered Cassandra to Telephus’s son Eurypylus, in order to induce Eurypylus to fight on the side of the Trojans. Cassandra was also the first to see the body of her brother Hector being brought back to the city.\n\nIn \"The Fall of Troy\", told by Quintus Smyrnaeus, Cassandra had attempted to warn the Trojan people that Greek warriors were hiding in the Trojan Horse while they were celebrating their victory over the Greeks with feasting. They disbelieved her, calling her names and degrading her with insults. She grabbed an axe in one hand and a burning torch in her other, and ran towards the Trojan Horse, intent on destroying it herself to stop the Greeks from destroying Troy. The Trojan people stopped her before she could do so. The Greeks hiding inside the Horse were relieved that the Trojans had stopped Cassandra from destroying it, but they were surprised by how clearly she had seen their plan to defeat Troy.\n\nAt the fall of Troy, Cassandra sought shelter in the temple of Athena. There she embraced the wooden statue of Athena in supplication for her protection, but was abducted and brutally raped by Ajax the Lesser. Cassandra was clinging so tightly to the statue of the goddess that Ajax knocked it from its stand as he dragged her away. One account claimed that even Athena, who had worked hard to help the Greeks destroy Troy, was not able to restrain her tears and her cheeks burned with anger. In one account, this caused her image to give forth a sound that shook the floor of the temple at the sight of Cassandra's rape, and her image turned its eyes away as Cassandra was violated, although others found this account too bold. Ajax's actions were a sacrilege because Cassandra was a supplicant of Athena and supplicants were untouchable in the sanctuary of a god, being under the protection of that god. Furthermore, he committed another sacrilege by raping her inside the temple of Athena, despite it being strictly forbidden for people to have sexual intercourse in a temple.\n\nOdysseus insisted to the other Greek leaders that Ajax should be stoned to death for his crimes, which had enraged Athena and the other gods. Ajax avoided their wrath, because none of them dared to punish him after he clung, as a supplicant, to Athena's altar and swore an oath proclaiming his innocence. Athena was furious at the Greeks' failure to punish Ajax for raping Cassandra in her temple, and she punished them severely with the help of Poseidon and Zeus. Poseidon sent storms and strong winds to destroy much of the Greek fleet on their way home from Troy. Athena punished Ajax herself, by causing him to have a terrible death, although the sources differ as to the manner of his death. The Locrians had to atone for Ajax's great sacrilege against Cassandra in Athena's temple by sending two maidens to Troy every year for a thousand years to serve as slaves in Athena's temple. However, if they were caught by the inhabitants before they reached the temple they were executed.\n\nIn some versions, Cassandra intentionally left a chest behind in Troy, with a curse on whichever Greek opened it first. Inside the chest was an image of Dionysus, made by Hephaestus and presented to the Trojans by Zeus. It was given to the Greek leader Eurypylus as a part of his share of the victory spoils of Troy. When he opened the chest and saw the image of the god, he went mad.\n\nCassandra was then taken as a concubine by King Agamemnon of Mycenae. Unbeknown to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clytemnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.\n\nCassandra was sent to the Elysian Fields after her death, because her soul was judged worthy due to her dedication to the gods, and her religious nature during her life.\n\nCassandra was buried either at Amyclae or Mycenae. The two towns disputed the possession of her grave. Heinrich Schliemann was certain that he had discovered Cassandra’s tomb when he had excavated Mycenae, because he found the remains of a woman and two infants in one of the circle graves at Mycenae.\n\nThe play \"Agamemnon\" from Aeschylus's trilogy \"Oresteia\" depicts the king treading the scarlet cloth laid down for him, and walking offstage to his death. After the chorus's ode of foreboding, time is suspended in Cassandra's \"mad scene\". She has been onstage, silent and ignored. Her madness that is unleashed now is not the physical torment of other characters in Greek tragedy, such as in Euripides' \"Heracles\" or Sophocles' \"Ajax\".\n\nAccording to author Seth Schein, two further familiar descriptions of her madness are that of Heracles in \"The Women of Trachis\" or Io in \"Prometheus Bound\". She speaks, disconnectedly and transcendent, in the grip of her psychic possession by Apollo, witnessing past and future events. Schein says, \"She evokes the same awe, horror and pity as do schizophrenics\". Cassandra is someone \"who often combine deep, true insight with utter helplessness, and who retreat into madness.\"\n\nEduard Fraenkel remarked on the powerful contrasts between declaimed and sung dialogue in this scene. The frightened and respectful chorus are unable to comprehend her. She goes to her inevitable offstage murder by Clytemnestra with full knowledge of what is to befall her.\n\nCassandra is an enduring archetype. Modern invocations of Cassandra are most frequently an example of a Cassandra complex. To emphasize such a situation, Cassandra's name is frequently used in fiction when prophecy comes up, especially true prophecy that is not believed. This can include the names of people, objects, or places.\n\nCassandra has been used as metaphor and allegory in psychological and philosophical tracts. For example, Florence Nightingale's book \"Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth\" has a section named for Cassandra, using her as a metaphor for the helplessness of women that she attributes to over-feminization. (Further examples are located on the Cassandra complex page.)\n\nThe Cassandra myth itself has also been retold several times by modern authors of novels and dramatizations, including works by Eric Shanower, Lindsay Clarke, Christa Wolf, Lesya Ukrainka, Woody Allen, Marion Zimmer Bradley, David Gemmell, and Hector Berlioz. A number of songs have also referred to her, such as \"Cassandra\" (1982), by Swedish pop band ABBA.\n\n\n\n"}

Communists had played an active role in the organisation, and John Cox, its chairman from 1971 to 1977, was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. From the late 1970s, MI5 downgraded CND to \"communist-penetrated\".\n\nIn 1985, Massiter, who as an MI5 officer had been responsible for the surveillance of CND from 1981 to 1983, resigned and made disclosures to a Channel 4 \"20/20 Vision\" programme, \"MI5's Official Secrets\". She said that her work was determined more by the political importance of CND than by any security threat posed by subversive elements within it, and argued that the organisation was contravening the rules governing its practices.\n\nIn 1983, she analysed telephone intercepts on John Cox that gave her access to conversations with Joan Ruddock and Bruce Kent. MI5 also placed a spy, Harry Newton, in the CND office. According to Massiter, Newton believed that CND was controlled by extreme left-wing activists and that Bruce Kent might be a crypto-communist, but Massiter found no evidence to support either opinion. CND activist Pat Arrowsmith, who had known Newton for twenty-five years, disputed the veracity of Massiter's allegations against him. On the basis of Ruddock's contacts, she had given an interview to a Soviet newspaper in 1981, MI5 suspected her of being a communist sympathiser.\n\nMassiter also revealed the surveillance of Harriet Harman and Patricia Hewitt, who had respectively held the posts of the legal officer and general secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties.\n\nRichard Norton-Taylor wrote in 2001 that Massiter's revelations in 1985 had never been officially challenged by the government, although British governments have a tradition of not commenting \"on matters of national security and intelligence.\"\n"}

{"id": "13850865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13850865", "title": "Conrad Bussow", "text": "Conrad Bussow\n\nConrad Bussow (1552 or 1553, Ilten, Hanover – 1617) was a German mercenary from Lower Saxony who lived in Riga in 1590s and in Muscovy in 1600–1611. In 1614–1617 Bussow compiled \"The Disturbed State of the Russian Realm\", an eye-witness history of the Time of Troubles. An early manuscript of his book was plagiarized by Peter Petreius in his \"History of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy\".\n\nConrad Bussow was born in the township of Ilten (part of present-day Sehnde near Hanover), in a family of a Lutheran pastor; his writing as a mature man suggests that he received a decent education at home, especially in Latin language and literature. He joined the military at the age of sixteen or seventeen. Details of his early service are unknown, but he eventually appeared in the troops of Stephen Báthory of Poland, engaged in the Livonian War. When Russia was forced out of this conflict, the Polish-Swedish coalition fell apart; Bussow changed sides and joined the Swedish service. In 1590s he lived in Riga; little is known of his family life except that two of his sons born in this period reached mature age and were alive in 1610s. His exact position in Swedish forces remains unclear; Bussow names himself \"Inspector and Intendant of the lands conquered in Livonia\" by Duke Karl of Södermanland.\n\nSwedish hold of Livonia eroded in late 1590s, the Poles were preparing to take it over and in 1599 Bussow changed sides again, deserting the weakened Swedish force for Muscovy. According to the version of Bussow' nemesis, Swedish envoy Peter Petreius, in 1599 agents of Boris Godunov recruited Bussow in Narva; Bussow agreed to hand the city over to Russians and secure neutrality of the German troops in his command. The plot was discovered and Bussow fled to Muscovy.\n\nBussow's treason was rewarded with lands in Russia and a small, unimportant military command. His subsequent service to Godunov, False Dmitriy I and Vasily Shuysky was unremarkable; Bussow stayed away from the political conflicts. In 1606 he somehow dissatisfied tsar Vasily Shuysky who relieved Bussow of his command and ordered him to retire in his Kaluga estate. There, he was caught in the middle of Ivan Bolotnikov's revolt. Bussow's son, also Conrad Bussow, joined the revolt; he was later caught, sentenced to exile in Siberia but returned safely after the fall of Shuysky. Bussow (senior) followed Bolotnikov's troops but did not engage in any decisive combat. Later, he would likewise follow the camps of Jan Piotr Sapieha and False Dmitry II. In 1611 Bussow realized that the Poles ultimately lost their war in Muscovy; he retired to Polish-occupied Riga and settled on writing a book of memoirs on the Time of Troubles. Perhaps he was motivated by the financial success of a book published by Jacques Margeret, a fellow mercenary in Muscovite service.\n\nBussow prepared two versions of his book. The first, compiled with the help of his son-in-law Martin Beer, was sent in 1613 to Frederick Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, master of the Wolfenbüttel Library. The Duke did not reply, either due to his internal problems, or due to Bussow's strained reputation as a deserter. This book never found its way to a printing press. Peter Petreius, the man who made Bussow's desertion a common knowledge among European courts, obtained a copy of the manuscript and reused or plagiarized its content in his own book issued in Swedish in 1615 and in German in 1620. The second manuscript, written by Bussow alone, was ready for publication in 1617. Bussow made a deal with a printer in Lübeck shortly before his death and the publication was cancelled. Petreius could now proceed with his plagiarism without remorse.\n\nAlthough the manuscripts were not printed in the 17th century, their placement in the Wolfenbüttel Library made them accessible to scholars. In 1690s Christian Kelch used both Bussow and Petreius as \"independent\" sources. In the first half of 19th century the relationship between Martin Beer, Conrad Bussow and Peter Petreius was not clearly understood; German and Russian scholars (notably Friedrich von Adelung, Nikolay Karamzin, Nikolai Rumyantsev) considered Beer, not Bussow, to be the primary author. Bussow was restored in his own right in 1849 by Arist Kunik and in 1858 by Sergey Solovyov.\n\nBussow's German text now exists in different manuscript copies, of which \"Wolfenbüttel II\" is probably the most authentic; the complete English translation (printed 1994) was based on 1961 \"Smirnov edition\" with cross-checking against the manuscripts.\n\nBussow as an author is remarkable in two aspects. On the upside, he \"seems to have had all the instincts of an investigative reporter. He always seemed to be where the action was.\" He personally knew the driving leaders of most of warring factions and was personally present at the crucial events of the war. Knowing spoken Russian well, Bussow could retell his Russian sources directly, without resorting to interpreters.\n\nAt the same time, \"it is amazing that someone could live for ten years in a country without acquiring the slightest insight into, or empathy to, the local culture.\" Bussow was as ignorant in matters of Orthodox Christianity and popular culture as he was competent in military tactics. However, the numbers provided in his generally credible descriptions of military actions are regarded as exaggerated.\n"}
{"id": "24121770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24121770", "title": "Death of Eliza Jane Scovill", "text": "Death of Eliza Jane Scovill\n\nEliza Jane Scovill (December 3, 2001 May 16, 2005) was the daughter of AIDS denialist Christine Maggiore, an HIV-positive activist who publicly questioned the link between HIV and AIDS, and supported HIV-positive pregnant women who want to avoid taking anti-HIV medication. Eliza Jane's May 16, 2005 death from AIDS at the age of three and a half sparked a social and legal controversy over her mother's decision not to take precautions during pregnancy and breastfeeding to prevent transmission of the virus, and her parents' decision to not have her treated for HIV infection during her life.\n\nIn 1992, Eliza Jane's mother, Christine Maggiore, tested positive for HIV. She subsequently became involved in volunteer work for a number of AIDS charities, including AIDS Project Los Angeles, L.A. Shanti, and Women at Risk. However, following an interaction with prominent AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg in 1994, she began to question whether HIV causes AIDS. Maggiore came to believe that her positive test may have been due to flu shots, pregnancy, or a common viral infection.\n\nMaggiore chose not to take antiretroviral drugs or other measures which reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during her pregnancies. Maggiore also breast-fed her children, despite evidence that breast-feeding can also transmit HIV from mother to child. Her younger child, Eliza Jane, was never tested for HIV, nor did she or her older brother Charlie receive any of the recommended childhood vaccines. (Maggiore later reported Charlie to have tested HIV-negative three times.) Maggiore discussed her beliefs as an AIDS dissident on Air America Radio in March 2005, stating that \"...our children have excellent records of health. They've never had respiratory problems, flus, intractable colds, ear infections, nothing. So, our choices, however radical they may seem, are extremely well-founded.\"\n\nSeveral weeks after this interview, in April 2005, Eliza Jane became ill with a runny nose. She was seen by a physician from the family's pediatric practice, who documented a normal physical exam. Several days later, Maggiore took Eliza Jane to see another pediatrician, Jay Gordon, who felt she had a mild ear infection. Reportedly, Gordon was aware of Maggiore's HIV status, but did not have Eliza Jane tested for HIV. According to the hospital report, filed just after Eliza Jane's death and based upon an interview with Maggiore, Eliza Jane \"had been diagnosed with pneumonia\" in the weeks preceding her death.\n\nWhen Eliza Jane failed to improve, Maggiore took her to see Philip Incao, a holistic practitioner and board member of Maggiore's AIDS-denialist organization Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives. Incao stated that Eliza Jane appeared \"mildly ill... no way I considered her in danger... she did not act as a patient acts if she's severely ill or in danger.\" On May 14, 2005, Incao prescribed amoxicillin for a presumed ear infection.\n\nThe following day, Eliza Jane became lethargic and vomited several times. While Maggiore was on the phone with Incao, Eliza Jane collapsed and stopped breathing. She was rushed by ambulance to Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, California. Physicians attempted to resuscitate Eliza Jane, but were unsuccessful. According to the hospital report, a \"chest x-ray revealed pneumonia,\" and Eliza Jane was pronounced dead at 5:40 AM on May 16, 2005.\n\nAn autopsy was performed. The senior deputy medical examiner for the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office found that Eliza Jane was markedly underweight and underheight, consistent with a chronic illness, and that she had pronounced atrophy of her thymus and other lymphatic organs. Examination of her lungs showed infection with \"Pneumocystis jirovecii\", a common opportunistic pathogen in people with AIDS and the leading cause of pediatric AIDS deaths. The post-mortem examination of Eliza Jane's brain showed changes consistent with HIV encephalitis; protein components of HIV itself were identified in Eliza Jane's brain tissue via immunohistochemistry.\n\nBased on the clinical information, the immunohistochemical documentation of HIV in Eliza Jane's brain, the evidence of pronounced immunosuppression, and the isolation of the opportunistic pathogen \"Pneumocystis jirovecii\" from Eliza Jane's lungs, the coroner concluded that Eliza Jane had died of Pneumocystis pneumonia in the setting of advanced AIDS. This conclusion was described by the coroner as \"unequivocal\".\n\nMaggiore rejected the coroner's conclusion, ascribing it to political bias and attacking the personal credibility of the senior coroner, James Ribe. Maggiore retained a board member of the organization she founded named Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives, toxicologist Mohammed Al-Bayati, to review the autopsy report. Al-Bayati holds a B.S. in veterinary medicine from the University of Baghdad, an M.S. from the University of Cairo, and a Ph.D. in comparative pathology from UC Davis. Among other subjects he studied human pathology for his doctorate. He has been described as a pseudoscientist. He is not a physician nor is he board-certified in human pathology. He is the author of a book entitled \"Get All The Facts: HIV Does Not Cause AIDS\".\n\nAl-Bayati released a report concluding that Eliza Jane had not died from AIDS or pneumocystis pneumonia, but from an allergic reaction to amoxicillin. Maggiore embraced Al-Bayati's conclusion that a reaction to amoxicillin was responsible, stating, \"I believe the unfortunate irony in this situation is that the one time that we were asked to and that we complied with mainstream medicine, we inadvertently gave our daughter something that took her life.\"\n\nAl-Bayati's report has been dismissed as both biased and medically unsound. Both the L.A. Times and ABC PrimeTime Live consulted independent experts in pathology about Eliza Jane's case; these experts agreed unequivocally with the coroner's conclusion that AIDS and resultant Pneumocystis pneumonia were the cause of death, and rejected Al-Bayati's report.\n\nFollowing Eliza Jane Scovill's death, Maggiore's beliefs and advocacy became points of controversy. Maggiore had held fast to her belief that HIV does not cause AIDS, and that Eliza Jane died of a reaction to amoxicillin. She submitted a letter to the \"LA Times\" alleging factual errors and omissions in their articles on Eliza Jane; the Times did not print the letter, stating that \"If facts in an article are wrong, a correction would be published. However, no correction is warranted in this case.\"\n\nOthers point to the evidence which indicates that Eliza Jane acquired AIDS from Maggiore perinatally or via breast feeding, that Eliza's HIV infection might have been prevented had Maggiore taken antiretroviral drugs or avoided breast feeding, that Eliza Jane's death was due to complications of AIDS, and that her death may have been preventable with proper medical care.\n\nJohn Moore, a prominent HIV/AIDS researcher speaking at the 16th International AIDS Conference, described Eliza Jane's death as a concrete example of the human harm that can result from pseudoscientific beliefs such as AIDS denialism:\n\nMaggiore's inclusion as an exhibitor at the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa has been criticized by AIDS activists.\n\nMaggiore's influence on Thabo Mbeki's decision to block funding of medical treatment of HIV-positive pregnant women was criticized following her death, with medical researchers noting a Harvard study which estimated \"330,000 lives were lost to new AIDS infections during the time Mbeki blocked government funding of AZT treatment to mothers.\"\n\nThe journalist and AIDS denialist Celia Farber wrote an article in June 2006 in the independent paper \"Los Angeles CityBeat\", arguing Maggiore's case and alleging incompetence, conspiracy, and coverups on the part of the coroner, the mainstream AIDS community, the mainstream media, and the medical community. In particular, Farber's article claimed that the coroner's office had not disclosed the records of Eliza Jane's HIV serology test, and quoted another denialist who claimed Eliza Jane's total lymphocyte count was elevated at the time of her death.\n\nThe death of Eliza Jane was investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Department of Child Protective Services as a possible case of medical neglect or child endangerment. On September 15, 2006 the LA County District Attorney's office announced that it would not file charges against Christine Maggiore, noting the difficult in proving negligence given that Maggiore did take her sick child to several physicians.\n\nIn September 2006, the Medical Board of California filed charges of gross negligence against one of these physicians, Paul Fleiss, who was Eliza Jane's pediatrician, alleging a failure to test Eliza Jane for HIV (or to document her parents' refusal of testing), a failure to counsel Maggiore to avoid breast-feeding at any time during the three years Maggiore breast-fed her daughter, given the risk of transmitting HIV, and similar violations of standard medical practice in Fleiss' care of a second HIV-positive child.\n\nIn September 2007, the Medical Board of California issued its decision in the Fleiss case, effective October 8, 2007. The Board revoked Fleiss' medical license, but stayed this action in favor of a 35-month probation period during which Fleiss must submit to regular monitoring, pay costs, notify insurance and hospitals of the decision against him, and take continuing medical education (CME) classes and record-keeping courses. He is not permitted to supervise Physician Assistants and has affirmed the practice of referring HIV-positive patients to a specialist.\n\nIn an admonition letter dated September 13, 2007, an Inquiry Panel of the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners issued its finding that Philip Incao's \"care and treatment and lack of timely documentation\" in the case of Eliza Jane Scovill \"falls below the generally accepted standards of medical practice\". The Panel warned Incao that any further instances of such behavior could result in \"formal disciplinary proceedings against your license to practice medicine\".\n\nMaggiore and her husband, Robin Scovill, sued Los Angeles county in 2007 for allegedly violating their daughter's civil rights and privacy by releasing her autopsy report, which indicated that she was HIV-positive. A $15,000 settlement was reached in 2009.\n\n"}

Burgum (born August 1, 1956) is an American entrepreneur, philanthropist and politician serving as the 33rd and current Governor of North Dakota since December 15, 2016. He is a member of the Republican Party. A 2017 profile in Forbes Magazine described him as “America's Best Entrepreneurial Governor.”\n\nHe joined Great Plains Software in 1983 and became the company’s president in 1984, which he later sold to Microsoft for $1.1 billion in 2001. At Microsoft he became the head of Microsoft Business Solutions. He began serving as chairman of the board for Atlassian in 2012. He also served on the board for SuccessFactors starting in 2007, and as chairman from 2010 to 2012. Burgum is the founder of Kilbourne Group, a Fargo-based real-estate development firm, and co-founder of Arthur Ventures.\n\nIn 2016, he announced his intention to run for Governor of North Dakota as a Republican candidate. With no formal political experience and despite losing the state Republican party's gubernatorial endorsement contest to longtime Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem at the party convention in April 2016, Burgum nevertheless defeated Stenehjem handily in the primary election two months later to claim the Republican nomination. Burgum ran against Democrat Marvin Nelson and Libertarian Marty Riske in the November 2016 gubernatorial election, and won in a landslide with over 75% of the vote.\n\nBurgum was born on August 1, 1956 and raised in Arthur, North Dakota, where his grandfather founded a grain elevator in 1906. He attended North Dakota State University to earn his undergraduate degree in 1978. During his senior year at NDSU he applied to the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. He also started a chimney-sweeping business. “The newspaper wrote a story about me as a chimney sweep,” he later recalled, “and ran a photo of me sitting on top of an icy chimney in below-freezing weather in Fargo. The story made the AP wire service. I was later told it caused quite a stir in the Stanford admissions office: 'Hey, there’s a chimney sweep from North Dakota who’s applied.'”\n\nHe was accepted to study business at Stanford. While there, he befriended Steve Ballmer, who would later be CEO of Microsoft. During his last year at Stanford, Burgum “spent the whole final quarter on a project team with Ballmer.” He received his MBA from Stanford University Graduate School of Business in 1980. He would later receive honorary doctorates from North Dakota State in 2000 and from the University of Mary in 2006. He married his first wife Karen Stoker in 1991 and later divorced.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Stanford GSB, Burgum moved to Chicago to become a consultant with McKinsey & Company. Soon afterward he mortgaged $250,000 of farm land in order to provide the seed capital for accounting software company Great Plains Software in Fargo, North Dakota. He joined the company in 1983 and became the company’s president in 1984 after leading a small investment group composed of family members in buying out the rest of the company.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Great Plains was often ranked in the top 100 companies to work for in the US by \"Fortune\" magazine. Burgum grew the company to about 250 employees by 1989 and led the company to about $300 million in annual sales and a 1997 IPO, after using the Internet to help the company expand beyond the borders of North Dakota. In 2001, Burgum sold Great Plains Software to Microsoft for $1.1 billion USD. Burgum has stated that he built the company in Fargo because of its proximity to North Dakota State University, in order to employ its stream of engineering students.\n\nFollowing the sale, Burgum was named Senior Vice President of Microsoft Business Solutions Group, the offshoot created from merging Great Plains into the corporation. He stayed with Microsoft until 2007 and was responsible for making enterprise apps a priority for Microsoft during this tenure. Satya Nadella, current CEO of Microsoft, has credited Burgum with “inspiring him to find the soul of Microsoft”.\n\nBurgum formerly served on the advisory board for Stanford Graduate School of Business and was on the board of SuccessFactors during the 2000s, becoming chairman of the board between 2007 and the 2011 sale of the company to SAP. In 2012 Burgum became the first chairman of the board for Atlassian, after it expanded from its initial board of three members (none of whom served as the official chair). During 2011 and 2014, he twice spent several months as the interim CEO of Intelligent InSites, a company for which he has served as the executive chairman of the board since 2008. That year he also became a member of the board of directors for Avalara.\n\nBurgum is the founder of the Kilbourne Group, a real-estate development firm focused on downtown Fargo. In 2013 Burgum created plans to build the tallest building in Fargo—a 23-story mixed-use building—to be named either Block 9 or Dakota Place. The company has also advocated for a convention center to be built in downtown Fargo. The company has acquired and renovated multiple properties in Fargo, including the former St. Mark’s Lutheran Church and the former Woodrow Wilson alternative high school. He is a co-founder of Arthur Ventures, a venture capital company. Several of the companies he has invested in are located in Fargo.\n\nBurgum supports philanthropic causes like the Plains Art Museum. In 2001 he donated a refurbished school building he had acquired in 2000 to North Dakota State University. It was named Renaissance Hall and became home to the university’s visual arts department, major components of the architecture and landscape architecture department and the Tri-College University office. Burgum started the Doug Burgum Family Fund in 2008, which focuses its charitable giving on youth, education and health.\n\nIn 2016, he announced his intention to run for Governor of North Dakota as a Republican candidate. With no formal political experience and despite losing the state Republican party's gubernatorial endorsement contest to longtime Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem at the party convention in April 2016, Burgum nevertheless defeated Stenehjem handily in the primary election two months later to claim the Republican nomination. Burgum ran against Democrat Marvin Nelson and Libertarian Marty Riske in the November 2016 gubernatorial election, where he easily won with over 75% of the vote.\n\nBurgum was sworn in as the 33rd Governor of North Dakota on December 15, 2016 alongside running mate, Brent Sanford, who was sworn in as the 38th Lieutenant Governor of North Dakota.\n\nBurgum has stated his support for the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\nHe married his first wife, Karen Stoker, in 1991 and divorced in 2003. They have three children. In 2016, he married Kathryn Helgaas. \n\n"}

Eseohe was born in Zaria, Nigeria on 9 April 1981 and is descended from a royal family of the Benin Empire. Eseohe Arhebamen’s maternal grandmother is Princess Theresa Maria Nodumwenben Osazuwa, a princess of the Edo people. Eseohe Arhebamen's great-grandfather Osazuwa Eredia, the father of Princess Theresa Osazuwa, was the Oba N’Ugu and enogie of Umoghumwun, making Eseohe Arhebamen a royal descendant and princess. \"The foundation of the kingdom of Ugu, with its capital at Umoghumwun has been traced to Prince Idu, the eldest son of Oba Eweka I.\"\n\nEseohe Arhebamen is the oldest of five siblings and frequently played a parental role in their upbringing. At the age of seven Eseohe's family immigrated to the United States and settled in Detroit, Michigan. At age 17 she enrolled in the University of Michigan at the Residential College. Although strongly encouraged to pursue medicine as a career path, Eseohe instead followed her passion for poetry, language and the arts. As an undergraduate student Eseohe focused on literary means and performance as a way to affect social change. While at the University of Michigan, Eseohe won prestigious awards for her writing and is included in a University of Michigan Anthology of Hopwood Award winners.\n\nAt 19 years old, Eseohe earned a position as Writer-in-Residence with InsideOut Literary Arts Project in Detroit, Michigan and worked with children in impoverished inner-city schools to expand their literary skills. After moving to New York in 2003, Eseohe founded the company EdoHeart also written as Edoheart which became her performance name. Eseohe Arhebamen is synonymous with Edoheart.\n\nEseohe received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan in Creative Writing and Literature in August, 2005, and went on to receive another Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art with a minor in English from Hunter College. She further graduated from New York University with a Master's degree in Performance Studies, which is described as drawing from a study of the performing arts, anthropology and sociology, literary theory, and legal studies. Eseohe also intensively studied Butoh dance with Yukio Waguri.\n\nAreas of interest in Eseohe Arhebamen’s experimental work are imaginative creation of alternate environments, and poetry and vocal expressions as a source for movement. She has choreographed and taught or led workshops involving these areas of interest at The Living Theatre and Columbia University’s Teacher’s College. Eseohe Arhebamen has appeared on Korean and American television and news, and in American, Estonian and Latvian newspapers. In 2011, she was chosen by artist Kalup Linzy to appear in a documentary about New York artists. Eseohe Arhebamen also appears in a video tape included in acclaimed poet Anne Waldman's papers purchased by the University of Michigan Special Collections Library.\n\nEseohe Arhebamen is the first indigenous and native-born African butoh performer. In addition, Eseohe Arhebamen is the first performer to combine butoh dance with singing, talking, mudra, sign language, spoken word, and experimental vocalizations after the traditional dance styles of the Edo people of West Africa. She refers to this dance style as Butoh-Vocal Theatre. Eseohe Arhebamen's Butoh-Vocal Theatre style arises out of her work in poetry, music and the traditional Edo theater in which performers dance and sing simultaneously, and is influenced by her expressed belief in a common lingual history between the Edo people of Nigeria and the Japanese. On 26 September 2010 Eseohe gave a performance at a Yukio Waguri intensive workshop demonstrating her style of Butoh-Vocal Theatre during which she danced butoh while singing Pure Imagination from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.\n\nEseohe’s notable performance during the Fifth Diverse Universe tour was described by Kaarel Kressa as embodying natural elegance and femininity; with poetry, dance and song that won the hearts of the audience. Eseohe's performances have also been called \"powerful ritual\".\n\nIn 2006, Eseohe married long time sweetheart Seth Yamasaki, son of Pulitzer Prize winning photographer Taro Yamasaki, and grandson of Minoru Yamasaki, Japanese-American architect best known for designing the World Trade Center. The two live in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was also charged with being a member of the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), an Islamic terrorist organization (designated as such by India and the USA, among other countries). He was arrested in February 2009 along with five others, charged with these crimes and prosecuted, but was acquitted after being given benefit of doubt. The late Shahid Azmi was his lawyer and fought his case \"pro bono.\" Faheem Ansari was discharged by court in May 2010, a few months after Shahid Azmi's death by gunmen in February 2010.\n\nAnsari's family was originally from Uttar Pradesh, but he was born and raised in Mumbai. He is married to Yasmin, with whom he has a daughter, Iqra. He joined the Lashkar e Toiba in 2003 while working in Dubai. In 2007, he returned to Mumbai and stayed there for about three months. Though his parents and brothers were residing in the Goregaon suburb of the city, he made no attempt to contact them during his entire stay. He first stayed at a guest house in Grant Road, but after a few weeks rented a small accommodation. Ansari had initially planned on renting an accommodation in Colaba, but due to the high rent there, decided to settle at Grant Road.\n\nThe Mumbai police alleged that Ansari did a reconnaissance of several prominent Mumbai landmarks, including the Mumbai Stock Exchange, the Mumbai police headquarters at Crawford Market, the Maharashtra police headquarters at Colaba, the Mahalakshmi Temple and the Siddhivinayak temple. Ansari went to the Taj Hotel and Oberoi Trident as a tourist and shot video footage of the interiors. He also videotaped the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Nariman House, and hand-drew the maps of all the 26/11 targets. In December 2007, Ansari travelled to Kathmandu, where he met and handed over the material to his associate, Sabahuddin Shaikh. He then travelled on a Pakistani passport to Karachi and gave the maps to an LET member named Muzammil.\n\nOn 10 February 2008, Uttar Pradesh police arrested Ansari along with five others. These included Pakistani nationals Romez alias \"Amar Singh\" and Sehwez alias \"Ajay Malhotra\" and Indian nationals Sohel, Sawauddin (or Sabauddin) Sanju and Baba Jung Bahadur. He was arrested for his involvement with an attack on a Central Reserve Police Force camp in Rampur on 31 December 2007, in which 7 paramilitary personnel and 1 civilian were killed. The interrogation revealed that Ansari had performed reconnaissance over twelve places in Mumbai, including government, police, transportation, tourist and financial sites over the course of two months. However, Ansari later alleged that the Mumbai police conveniently made him a scapegoat and deliberately falsified evidence against him.\n\nOn 31 December 2008, Ansari, along with Sabauddin Shaikh, was formally accused of aiding the November 2008 attackers in Mumbai. The interrogation of Ajmal Kasab and of Ansari, revealed that none of the attackers had been in the city before the attacks, and acted solely on intelligence provided by Ansari. On 11 February 2010, his lawyer Shahid Azmi was murdered in what was suspected by authorities to be a professional contract killing. On 3 May 2010, Ansari and the co-accused Sabauddin Shaikh were acquitted of any complicity in the attacks. In the acquittal, the Judge blasted the Mumbai police for the case it made against him and Sabauddin Shaikh. They were shifted from Arthur Road Jail to Uttar Pradesh to stand trial in connection with the CRPF camp attack at Rampur in 2007.\n\nAdvocate Ejaz Naqvi, the lawyer for Ansari, presented in court an allegation that a female FBI agent had removed all of Ansari's clothes and showed him pornographic films. Naqvi also requested that Ansari be taken for a medical examination. The court asked the Crime Branch to investigate and report by 26 February 2009, and ordered the medical examination. Ansari had earlier questioned the right of FBI agents to interrogate him.\n\nfahim anvar attack mumbai- boss groups\n"}

She was born in Poona, India, but spent most of her childhood in Ireland. In 1871 she married Major John Swiney (1832–1918), and devoted herself to becoming a full-time wife and mother. Swiney relocated to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1877, a place she described later in her life as \"the town of no ideals\", where her husband joined her ten years later.\n\nSince 1890, Swiney was a feminist activist, lecturer, and writer in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. She co-founded the Cheltenham Women’s Suffrage Society (Cheltenham WSS) in 1896; was Vice President of the Cheltenham Food Reform and Health Association; and lectured in organisations such as the Higher Thought Centre in London, Theosophical lodges, and Ethical Societies. Swiney was a member of the Theosophical Society (TS), the Sociological Society, the National Union of Women Workers (NUWW), the Eugenics Education Society, the Secular Education League, the Woman’s Freedom League (WFL), and the National Woman’s Social and Political Union (WSPU), as well as of the council of the Woman’s Branch of the International Neo-Malthusian League.\n\nIn addition to her activism, she engaged in feminist debates through her writings. She regularly contributed to \"The Anglo-Russian\", \"The Christian Commonwealth, The Awakener, The Westminster Review\" as well as the \"Indian Ladies’ Magazine\" and the American feminist paper \"The Woman’s Tribune\". Furthermore, Swiney published a series of books and pamphlets, such as \"The Awakening of Women\" (1899) and \"The Bar of Isis\" (1907). \n\nSwiney was personally connected to various prominent and important figures of her time, such as Charlotte Despard, Harriet McIlquham, Charlotte Stopes, Margaret Sibthorpe, Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy, and Annie Besant.\n\nSince 1910, her books were co-published by the League of Isis, which she founded in 1909. The League of Isis aimed to bring about ‘the betterment of the Race, by individual observance of the Natural Law of reproduction (…) for the building up of the Higher Self’. This organisation, together with her writings, reflects a deep engagement in theosophical teachings: the belief in a spiritual evolution and in the Divine Mother (Isis), as well as the convincement that Theosophy can overcome the boundaries between science and religion.\n\nContemporary conceptions of motherhood and race strongly influenced Frances Swiney, the Theosophist, feminist, and eugenicist. \n\nLike other feminists at that time, she reversed the negative connotations of womanhood and motherhood and used it for her own argumentation, to fight for women’s enfranchisement. Swiney claimed justice for women as ‘aiders in creating the wealth of the nation and as mothers of the race’.\n\nSwiney’s feminist emphasis on motherhood, race, and evolution also influenced her interpretations of Theosophy. This is the reason why Swiney focussed on one particular aspect of theosophical thought: the Divine Feminine, or the Divine Mother, as personated by the Goddess Isis, and her role in the cosmic process. Herein, Swiney’s theosophical concepts differ from mainstream Theosophy. This is evidence for her own, personal, feminist agenda within an esoteric framework.\"The Mother, then, is the Supreme Unity, uniting all in Herself. It is not difficult why in the eternal sequence of things in evolution the human race is awakening to the truth of the Divine Feminine in the present stage of the world history. (…) Relatively speaking, the race, still in its immature youth, expelled the Mother from the nursery, and anarchy and chaos prevailed, (…). The evolved soul has always known that this intense craving for union once more with the Feminine Principle must be the first sign of the regenerate heart.\"For her, the Divine Mother was oneness of the sublime cause, and all emanation would derive from her and return to her in the end of the circled cosmic process: \"For the soul is the feminine creative principle in man (…). The Feminine is therefore the inner nature of man, and woman (…), the objective representative of the Divine Feminine.\"Swiney’s imperial context (personal and family connections to British India) influenced her perception and interpretation of Theosophy and, therefore, her theosophical feminism. Furthermore, Theosophy, and esotericism in general, were deeply embedded in the discourse of Britain’s First Wave Feminism, as it is evident especially by the vast number of theosophical feminists. \n\n\n"}

In 1893, at age 25, Murnu was appointed professor at the University of Iaşi and shortly afterwards was awarded a scholarship by the Romanian State in order to complete his postgraduate studies in Munich, and, after several years he returned to Romania after completing a doctorate in philology.

Just before Sultan Murad II's death, she gave birth to her only son, Şehzade Mustafa, who was to be his father's favourite. According to Turkish tradition, all princes were expected to work as provincial governors as a part of their training. Mustafa was sent to govern Konya and later Kayseri, and Gülşah accompanied him.\n\nMustafa died in June 1474 of natural causes. It was rumored that Mustafa had approached Mahmud Pasha's wife and thus making him the person behind Mustafa's murder. There are speculations that Gülşah Hatun may have been a party to the illicit relations between the prince and wife of Mahmud Pasha. Giovanni Maria Angiolello, a Venetian traveler, author of an important historical report on the Aq Qoyunlu and early Safavid Persia, who was in the service of Mustafa, and who with the rest of Mustafa’s household accompanied the prince’s cortege from his post his Kayseri to Bursa, where he was buried, denied any role for Mahmud Pasha in Mustafa's death; nevertheless Mehmed II had the man executed shortly thereafter.\n\nGülşah Hatun had not been informed of his death, and with the wagon with her dead son stopped outside the palace, she and the women of her train began to wail. Babinger wrote that Mustafa's only child, Princess Nergiszade , shared her grandmother's grief, and the lamentations went on endlessly. Mehmed sent word that she should remain in Bursa with those maidens whom she required. Mehmed also had a good provision made for her, where she might live there honorably. He ordered that Mustafa’s daughter and her mother and rest of the ladies together with all others belonging to the court of his decreased son should come to Istanbul. All the women were lodged in the palace where women of Mehmed's harem stayed, and after several days the maidens were married to courtiers. Nergiszade married her cousin Şehzade Ahmet, son of Şehzade Bayezid. According to Alderson Mustafa had two daughters: Nergisşah and Bülbül. Nergiszade married Şehzade Ahmet in 1474 and Bülbül married Şehzade Abdullah, also son of Şehzade Bayezid in 1480.\n\nIn 1479, Gülşah Hatun was granted the village of Sığırcalu in Dimetoka, its revenues were converted into mülk so that Gülşah could turn it into an endowment for the eventual upkeep of her tomb in Bursa. Gülşah Hatun died in 1487, and was buried in Bursa in the tomb she had built for herself near that of Mustafa. The tomb of Gülşah Hatun has an entrance with elegant jogged voussoirs, and marble cenotaphs inside, newly-made from old pieces.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "850121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=850121", "title": "Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta", "text": "Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta\n\nHorace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta (; 11 November 1771 – 20 July 1851) was a French soldier, diplomat, and politician, who served as Naval Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of State under the July Monarchy.\n\nHaving joined the French Revolutionary Army in his youth, Sébastiani rose through its ranks before becoming a supporter of Napoleon Bonaparte. Sébastiani was the French Consulate's emissary to The Levant, notably drafting plans to reconquer Ottoman Egypt, and later served as the Empire's Ambassador to The Porte. In the latter capacity, he attempted to increase French influence and signaled pro-Russian activities in the Danubian Principalities, thus provoking the War of 1806–1812. In 1807, Sébastiani organized the defense of Constantinople during the Dardanelles Operation. Recalled due to British pressure after the deposition of Selim III, he served in the Peninsular War and resided in the Alhambra, took part in the unsuccessful invasion of Russia, and defended the Champagne region in front of the Sixth Coalition.\n\nSébastiani recognized the Bourbon Restoration, but rallied with Napoleon during the Hundred Days, being elected to the Chamber for the first time in 1815. Briefly exiled after the return of King Louis XVIII, he was again admitted as a Deputy in 1819, sitting with the Left faction, supporting liberal politics, and coming into conflict with the Jean-Baptiste de Villèle Cabinet. After the July Revolution, he endorsed Louis-Philippe. Sébastiani's time as Foreign Minister saw France's involvement in the Belgian Revolution, its refusal to sanction the November Uprising, the controversial solution to a commercial dispute with the United States, and the French occupation of Ancona. In later years, he progressed in French Government service as an ambassador.\n\nThe 1847 murder of his daughter, Francoise, Duchess de Praslin indirectly helped spark the 1848 Revolution.\n\nBorn in La Porta, Corsica, Sébastiani was the son of a tailor and well-to-do craftsman, the nephew of , a Roman Catholic priest who was later Bishop of Ajaccio, and probably a distant relative of the Bonapartes. Horace Sébastiani had a brother, , who rose to the rank of \"Maréchal de Camp\". Initially destined for a religious career, he left his native island during the French Revolution, and entered the army in 1792. Briefly dispatched as a secretary to Conte Raffaele Cadorna in Casablanca, Sébastiani participated in the Revolutionary Wars, including campaigns in Corsica, 1793, the Alps, 1794–1797, and at the Battle of Marengo, 1800. Having served as an officer in the , he was promoted to Colonel in 1799.\n\nSébastiani joined Lucien Bonaparte's entourage, and endorsed Napoleon's political actions, taking an active part in the 18 Brumaire coup (9 November 1799). In 1802, the Consulate sent him on his first diplomatic assignments in the Ottoman Empire, Ottoman Egypt, and other parts of The Levant. Among his first actions were the settlement of a conflict between Sweden and the Barbary State of Tripoli, as well as obtaining the latter's agreement to recognize the Italian Republic.\n\nSébastiani negotiated with the British military commanders in the aftermath of the French invasion of Egypt (1798), asking them to abide by the newly signed Treaty of Amiens and withdraw from Alexandria; following this he met with Ottoman officials in Cairo, unsuccessfully offering to mediate between them and rebellious beys (\"see Muhammad Ali's seizure of power\"). In late 1802, he traveled to Akka, and negotiated a trade agreement with the local pasha.\n\nDuring this period, Sébastiani theorized that, despite Egyptian Campaign's failure, the French could yet again establish their control over the region. He publicized this view in a report, published by \"Le Moniteur Universel\" on 30 January 1803, posing a threat for both British and Russian interests; this probably contributed to deescalating relations between the latter two over the prolonged British presence in Malta, with Henry Addington's Cabinet indicating that British troops would remain as long as France held designs to invade Egypt.\n\nReturning to France, he was put in charge of the littoral from the mouth of the Vilaine (in Morbihan) to Brest, before, in 1804, being despatched on a short mission to the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. Promoted Brigadier-General in 1803, he commanded \"Grande Armée\" troops during the Battle of Ulm. After leading a successful attack on Günzburg, Sébastiani followed the Austrians into Moravia (1805), having been promoted \"Général de division\" after the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, where he was wounded.\n\nAppointed French Ambassador to The Porte on 12 April 1806, and gaining his post on 10 August, he attempted to convince Sultan Selim III to exclude the Royal Navy from access through the Dardanelles. According to a biographical essay published by the \"Revue des Deux Mondes\" in 1833, Sébastiani faced almost universal hostility from the anti-French diplomatic corps—whose opinions were influenced by the Russian Count Andrei Yakovlevich Budberg and the British Ambassador Charles Arbuthnot. The same article claimed: \"France had for its allies only the envoys of Spain and Holland\". Among Horace Sébastiani's moves to enlist Ottoman support for Napoleon was the establishment of a printing press in Constantinople, which published works of French literature translated into Turkish and Arabic.\n\nSébastiani persuaded the Ottomans to take a stand against Russia after bringing attention to the anti-Ottoman conspiracy in Wallachia, formed around Prince Constantine Ypsilantis, as well as to the suspicious policies of Moldavia's Prince Alexander Mourousis. According to the aristocratic Wallachian memoirist and politician Ion Ghica, Selim \"followed the advice of General Sébastiani, who tried to bring him to Napoleon's side\", and saw a connection between the Prince and the Serbian Uprising:\n\"He felt that [Ypsilantis] sided with the Russians and had an understanding with Pazvantoğlu of Vidin and with Czerny-George the Serbian, both of whom had rebelled against The Porte.\"\n\nThe conflict itself started when Russia considered Ypsilantis' deposition to go against the letter of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and the Treaty of Jassy. While the Russian Count and Ambassador Arbuthnot prepared to leave Istanbul, The Porte convened to have the two Princes reinstated. Despite this, Russian troops under General Ivan Michelson and Count Mikhail Miloradovich entered the two Danubian Principalities (\"see Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)\"). Prince Ypsilantis had previously escaped to the Russian camp, and was briefly considered by his allies as ruler over both principalities (just before Russian occupation took over); the French Consul to Moldavia, Charles-Frédéric Reinhard, reportedly not informed of Sébastiani's contacts with Selim, was arrested by the Russian troops. As a major consequence of this chain of events, France pulled the strings of Ottoman foreign policy.\nDuring the parallel Anglo-Turkish War in 1807, Sébastiani helped the Ottomans in the successful defense of Constantinople against the British squadron of Admiral Duckworth (\"see Dardanelles Operation\"). The British bombardment, coming at a time when the Muslim population was celebrating \"Eid al-Adha\", was met with panic, and Sébastiani's group of French military officers was soon the only organized force present on the European side. In his messages to Selim, Sir John Duckworth asked for the French ambassador to be removed, for the Ottoman fleet and the Dardanelles military facilities to be handed over, and for Russia to be granted rule over Wallachia and Moldavia. The Sultan sent envoys requesting Sébastiani to leave Ottoman territory, but the French Ambassador explained that he would not do so until being ordered by Selim himself.\n\nAs the matter was being debated, Janissary forces on the Anatolian shore organized themselves, and, once increased in strength, began responding to the attack. Selim subsequently asked Sébastiani and his men (including Louis Gustave le Doulcet and , as well as the embassy's secretary ), to oversee Constantinople's defense and the line of fire nearby Topkapı Palace, organizing maneuvers which caused Duckworth to withdraw.\n\nIn 1806, Sébastiani married Jeanne-Françoise-Antoinette (Fanny) , only daughter of François-Henri de Franquetot, marquis de Coigny). She died in childbirth while in Constantinople, just a few days before the Sultan was deposed (14 April 1807), and left Sébastiani a large fortune. Upon hearing news of her death, Sultan Selim transmitted condolences through his \"Dragoman\".\n\nThe successful rebellion led by Kabakçı Mustafa and the Janissary troops put an end to French diplomatic success. Sébastiani negotiated with Kabakçı, while the British sought support from various factions inside Constantinople — the \"Dragoman\", Aleko Soutzos, eventually informed the French Ambassador on the parallel British projects. This resulted in Soutzos' beheading — that which, in Ion Ghica's version of events, caused the Soutzos family of Phanariotes to abandon their commitment to France and begin supporting Russia. According to the \"Revue des Deux Mondes\" biography, Sébastiani had betrayed Aleko Soutzos' confidence by revealing as many details of Anglo-Ottoman negotiations as to render it clear that the \"Dragoman\" had been acting as his spy, and by failing to respect the promise of French protection.\n\nUnder the new monarch, Mustafa IV, he attempted to impose a pro-French pasha as governor of Baghdad, and later provoked a scandal by asking for the Imperial Executioner, \"Bostanci-başi\", to be demoted—this came after three Ragusan subjects, having been found guilty of theft, were subjected to \"falaka\", despite the facts that the recent annexation of Ragusa by France offered them a degree of immunity. As a result of his pressures, Sébastiani obtained rule over the province of Baghdad for his favorite, and, in return, allowed the \"Bostanci-başi\" to remain in office.\n\nHe asked to be recalled in April 1807, being replaced by \"Chargé d'affaires\" Faÿ de La Tour Maubourg. This departure was also prompted by renewed British requests. Shortly before his leaving, Sultan Mustafa awarded Sébastiani the Order of the Crescent 1st Class, which has been interpreted as a measure to alleviate the impact of British successes. According to other accounts, Mustafa himself had become deeply dissatisfied with Sébastiani's interventions and policies. Upon his return to France, Sébastiani received the \"Grand Aigle de la Légion d'honneur\". The \"Revue des Deux Mondes\" speculated that, based on the Corsican heritage he shared with Sébastiani:\n\"the Emperor would often keep his eyes closed in respect to his Generals' mistakes.As for [Sébastiani's] diplomatic skills, Napoleon was so affected that he sent him to the arms as soon as he returned from the Orient, and did not assign him to any negotiations until his fall [of 1814].\"\n\nSébastiani became a Count of the Empire, and commanded the IVth Corps in the Peninsular War, notably at the Battle of Ciudad-Real, the Battle of Talavera, and the Battle of Almonacid. In 1810, he took Linares, Jaén, Granada and Málaga. Troops under his command included a group of Polish \"émigré\" soldiers, among them Albert Grzymała, who served on his staff and was later noted for his friendship with Frédéric Chopin.\n\nStarting from that date, Sébastiani gained a reputation for lacking leadership skills: popularly nicknamed \"General Surprise\" as a result of having been caught out by enemy troops a significant number of times, he was argued by Jean-Baptiste de Marbot to have been noted for nothing other than mediocrity. According to the 1833 \"Revue des Deux Mondes\", he had also become known for his lassitude, to the point where Napoleon himself grew irate. The same source recounted that, after Talavera de la Reina and especially after Almonacid, the general raised suspicion that he wasted men and resources, systematically failed to report all his casualties, and seriously exaggerated the scale of his victories. It was contended that the Emperor eventually withdrew Sébastiani's command of the IVth Corps after concluding that this assessment was correct.\n\nSome sources claim that Sébastiani was created \"1º Duque de Murcia\" by Napoleon; according to the \"Revue\", although nominated for the title by the new King of Spain, Joseph Bonaparte, Sébastiani was denied appointment by Napoleon (a gesture alleged to have itself been based on the General's conduct at Almonacid). Nonetheless, it was reported that Sébastiani made use of the title for the rest of his participation in the Spanish expedition. The \"Revue\" claimed that the ducal title \"of Murcia\" was adopted by the General himself, after he reaped a minor victory in Lorca and reportedly advanced a project to gain the region back from \"guerrilla\" forces (the plan was to be discarded by Sébastiani's commander, Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult).\n\nSébastiani is reported to have plundered a number of Roman Catholic convents during the Peninsular expedition. Having stationed his troops in the Alhambra, where he himself resided in noted luxury, Sébastiani partly destroyed the palace's fortifications after retreating. It is argued that he was also responsible for the partial devastation of the palace's interior. The American author Washington Irving, who visited Spain in the following period, recounted that: \n\"With that enlightened taste which has ever distinguished the French nation in their conquests, this monument of Moorish elegance and grandeur was rescued from the absolute ruin and desolation that were overwhelming it. The roofs were repaired, the saloons and galleries protected from the weather, the gardens cultivated, the watercourses restored, the fountains once more made to throw up their sparkling showers; and Spain may thank her invaders for having preserved to her the most beautiful and interesting of her historical monuments.\"\n\nServing during Napoleon's invasion of Russia, under Marshal Joachim Murat, and in the Campaign of 1812–1813, he commanded a cavalry division, becoming noted in the battles of Borodino (being the first French commander to enter Moscow, but was later forced to retreat with heavy losses), Bautzen, Lützen, Leipzig (where he was wounded), and Hanau. After attempting to hold Cologne, he took part in the defense of French territory, holding a command position in Champagne and organizing troops in Châlons-en-Champagne. In March, he assisted in the retaking of Reims, where he faced the Imperial Russian Army troops under the command of Emmanuel de Saint-Priest.\n\nChanging sides to support Talleyrand on 10 April 1814, Sébastiani was appointed to the Bourbon Restoration Government and was, on 2 June, awarded the Order of Saint Louis by King Louis XVIII. Nevertheless, upon news that Napoleon was returning from Elba, he abandoned his command and left for Paris, where, together with the Count de Lavalette, he organized National Guard detachments to assist the Emperor. Napoleon also sent him over to attract support from the liberal politician Benjamin Constant; soon after, Constant became involved in drafting the more permissive \"Acte Additionel\", which amended the \"Constitution of the Year XII\".\n\nDuring the Hundred Days, he was assigned the reviewing of legislation passed by Louis XVIII, and organized the National Guard in Picardy. Sébastiani was elected to the Chamber for the department of Aisne. After the Battle of Waterloo, he voted in favor of Napoleon's abdication, and, eventually, was among those assigned with negotiating a peace with the Seventh Coalition (as part of a delegation also comprising Benjamin Constant de Rebecque, the marquis de La Fayette, marquis d'Argenson and comte de Pontécoulant). During talks, he showed himself opposed to a second Bourbon return.\n\nSébastiani spent a year in England before being allowed to return (having retired from active service and receiving half pay). Starting in 1819, after being promoted by the Duke Decazes, he was a prominent member of the Chamber of Deputies, initially representing Corsica, rallying with the Left. According to the \"Revue\"'s comments, his political choice was unusual, reportedly astonishing both members of the Left and the moderate Decazes, a Royalist. Inside the Chamber, he joined forces with Maximilien Sebastien Foy, notably pushing projects to recognize the merits of \"Grande Armée\" veterans; a speech he held on the latter occasion, which gave praise to the French tricolor, caused an uproar among conservative deputies.\n\nDuring the French legislative election, 1824, his attempt to campaign in Corsica was frustrated by the local authorities representing the Royalist Government of Jean-Baptiste de Villèle, and he subsequently won 1 out of 48 votes. Instead, after General Foy's death in late 1825, he was elected as replacement in his constituency, the Aisne town of Vervins, receiving 120 votes out of 200.\n\nAfter the July Revolution, he held the posts of Naval Minister under the nominal leadership of François Guizot (autumn 1830), and Foreign Affairs under Jacques Laffitte and Casimir Pierre Perier. During the Revolution, he parted with the Left, and made declarations in support of Charles X—including one which proclaimed that the only national flag was the white one for the Bourbons. Allegedly establishing links with the radical \"Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera\" society in the early days of the July Monarchy, he subsequently rallied with the centrist politics of the Orléanist camp. With Laffitte, Benjamin Constant, Jean-Guillaume Hyde de Neuville, Adolphe Thiers, and others, he played a prominent part in calling Louis-Philippe to the French throne.\n\nAfter that, the Sébastianis became the most influential faction in Corsica, replacing the Legitimist Pozzo di Borgo family — one of the latter, Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo, was a high-ranking Russian diplomat who negotiated with Horace Sébastiani on several occasions.\n\nIn the wake of the Belgian Revolution, when candidatures were considered for the Belgian throne, Sébastiani had the task of undermining support for Auguste of Leuchtenberg and drawing allegiances for the Duke of Nemours. After Nemours refused the Belgian crown, he transferred French support to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the British-backed candidate, in exchange for Leopold's agreeing to marry Louise-Marie of France. This policy was viewed as a capitulation by the Legitimists, and most notably by Jean Maximilien Lamarque, who, while deploring the separation of the French and the French-speaking Walloons, accused Sébastiani of having obtained the destruction of fortifications in Belgium not as a concession from other states, but rather because \"the allied powers want to set aside the means of entering France without running into obstacles\".\n\nWhen the London Conference compelled Dutch forces to evacuate Belgian territory, Sébastiani indicated that the French troops under General Gérard were to remain in the area until \"all reasons why the French Army has maneuvered would be dealt with resolutely, and no danger would threaten us\". Nevertheless, Gérard retreated before the Conference came to an end. When Chamber called on the minister to answer about the discrepancy, he declared himself \"astonished\" by news of the retreat, attributing it to British pressures, and indicated that \"we have entered Belgium in good will; good will is what led us to withdraw\".\n\nIn late 1830, after the November Uprising broke out in Congress Poland, Sébastiani, despite the revolutionaries' expectations, chose to avoid his country's involvement. As Russian troops carried out a violent intervention against the rebellion, a deputy in the Sejm lamented that Poland was perishing without having even seen a French courier; the minister responded to similar accusations at home by stating that France was determined not to raise the anger of Emperor Nicholas. Nevertheless, some time after the Uprising erupted, Sébastiani received Polish envoys with sympathy, and had felt secure that \"a friendly arrangement with Russia\" could be achieved. To this end, he sent a mission to Saint Petersburg, which attempted to mediate an understanding between the Polish revolutionaries and Russia; in order to undermine communications between France and Poland, the government of Viktor Kochubey took the decision of recognizing the July Monarchy, which it had refused to do until then. In January 1831, after pressures from the Marquis de La Fayette, the Duke of Mortemart was dispatched to Russia in order to seek a new agreement—his mission was made ineffectual by the revolutionaries' decision to dethrone Nicholas from his position as King of Poland, which in turn led to a standoff between all sides involved.\n\nIn parallel, Sébastiani allegedly approved the designs of Armand Charles Guilleminot, the Ambassador to The Porte, who attempted to undermine the Holy Alliance by stressing that Russian actions in Poland and the Balkans could rally opposition from Austria, the Ottoman Empire and the United Kingdom. Guilleminot ultimately presented the Ottomans with an offer to back an independent Poland—as a consequence, Foreign Minister Sébastiani was formally asked by Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo to recall the ambassador, and he ultimately agreed to do so.\n\nHistorian Barthélemy Hauréau indicated that the moderate path pursued by Sébastiani had been largely responsible for convincing Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki to postpone military operations, to the point where it was later contended that the minister was plotting with Russian authorities. He referred to Sébastiani's position as \"a miserable role\", and to his correspondence with the Poles as \"perfidious epistles\".\n\nWhen Poland was ultimately pacified, Sébastiani uttered the famous words: \n\"Order reigns in Warsaw.\"\n\nThe statement itself was not rendered verbatim by the \"Moniteur\", allegedly due to their potential for causing scandal. As Sébastiani's words began circulating freely, public opinion considered them evidence of callousness, and, in December, they were used by J. J. Grandville as title for a cartoon showing the effects of repression in Congress Poland. Another of Grandville's drawings, depicting the authorities' violent response to public manifestations of support for Polish revolutionaries, was titled \"Public Order Reigns Also in Paris\" (sold together, the two works caused the artist to be censored and his house to be raided by policemen). It was also contended that the statement had been made by Sébastiani with the specific goal of persuading Russia that France did not condemn the intervention — reportedly, Emperor Nicholas normalized relations with France and received its ambassador, the Duke of Trévise, only after hearing news of Sébastiani's speech.\n\nLater, he justified himself in front of the Chamber by arguing that intervention in Poland was doomed to failure, noting that a French landing on Poland's Baltic shore was made impossible by both distance and the minor scale of facilities in Polangen. When interpellated in the Chamber, he also contended that France had managed to obtain consensus that Russia was to maintain a degree of Polish autonomy, as these had been stipulated by the 1814–1814 Congress of Vienna. Reflecting upon public sentiment at a time when Radicalism had become a European phenomenon, he was also quoted saying:\n\"There are those who want to drag us into a war of opinions, to dump us into an apparent alliance of peoples versus governments; we ask them with what right do they pretend to attribute themselves or assign us the mission of revolutionizing all the peoples. We know their goal and their secret thought. These people work to bring disruptions on the inside through disruptions on the outside. What they want, we avoid; what they fear, we seek. In the absence of set rules of conduct, their exhortations, their fears and their joys would suffice for shedding light on our path and making us perceive the abysses where they would like to throw us.\"\n\nDuring a Chamber session in September 1831, the liberal Marquis de La Fayette publicly accused the Laffitte cabinet in general and Sébastiani in particular of having secretly encouraged the Poles while persuading them to delay their attack on Russian troops (allegedly promising that France would give them official backing following that moment, and later forfeiting the pledge). La Fayette also stressed that it was possible for France to sanction Polish independence, especially since the Holy Alliance appeared to have been divided on the issue. According to Karl Marx, when Sébastiani defended his ministry and stressed that he had not made Poland any promises, the Marquis confronted him with a letter signed by Karol Kniaziewicz, dated September 1830, which contained references to Sébastiani's guarantees and his call to postpone the offensive. The \"Revue des Deux Mondes\" recounted that the diplomat Talleyrand and Sébastiani both maintained an independent line in politics—their secretive notes reportedly contributed to the fall of the Laffitte government.\n\nOver the following year, he and Prime Minister Périer were called upon by the Marquis de La Fayette to express disapproval for reactionary politics in the Austrian Empire, and to allow Italian Carbonari refugees such as Cristina Trivulzio di Belgiojoso to remain on French territory. La Fayette noted that Sébastiani had undertaken:\n\"efforts to revoke and prevent the sequestration [of property] that was inflicted [by Austria] on the Italian men and women who are traveling in France.\"\n\nIn February 1832, Sébastiani took initiative in ordering a French occupation of Ancona. The \"Revue\" argued that this was the most significant gesture of his career, and credited him with having planned it as an indirect but effective strike at Austrian economic interests, when implying that France would march into Rome and Trieste in the event of a war with Austria.\n\nAmong his last actions in office as Foreign Minister were negotiations with the United States over losses suffered by American citizens during the Napoleon's Continental Blockade, when several ships bearing the American flag were arrested in European ports, on suspicion that they were in fact serving British commercial interests (\"see Embargo Act of 1807\"). Raising much controversy, he set the sum France agreed to pay at 25 million francs, 10 million more than what committees of the \"Conseil d'État\" and Chamber had decided, although still significantly less than what had been asked by American plaintiffs.\n\nIt was during the same period that Sébastiani remarried, to Aglaé-Angélique-Gabrielle de Gramont, one of Héraclius, duc de Gramont's daughters and the widow of the Russian General . He retired from office after suffering a stroke which left him partly paralyzed, and traveled in the Italian Peninsula. He was later Minister of State for a short period of time.\n\nIn 1833, Sébastiani was ambassador to the Two Sicilies, and in 1835–1840, to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. He was recalled and replaced by François Guizot after refusing, against his government wishes, to support the cause of Muhammad Ali's design to extend his rule out of the Egyptian realm by conquering Ottoman lands in Syria (\"see London Straits Convention\"). Adolphe Thiers later pointed out that he agreed with Sébastiani's view, which he defined as:\n\"The apprehension [...] over seeing France engaging in the Oriental question, to find herself the only one of that opinion, and from that moment on to be reduced to the alternative of either ceding or risk a universal war over an object that was not worth it [...].\"\n\nDuring the ministerial crisis provoked by the fall of the Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult cabinet, before Thiers' nomination, Sébastiani was considered for the office of Premier; his failure to gain the position was attributed to rejection from all political camps, based on the view that he was overtly subservient to King Louis-Philippe.\n\nHe was made Marshal of France in 1840, replacing the deceased Nicolas Joseph Maison, and represented Ajaccio in the Chamber for several terms. He became a Peer of France in 1842. The \"Revue des Deux Mondes\"' François Buloz announced, in April 1835, that was involved in heated disputes with other public figures, over repeated allegations that his brother had harmed French interests in the American creditors' affair. In this and other cases of the period, the same controversy almost erupted into duels.\n\nHaving largely retired from public life, he had his last years clouded by the 1847 death of his sole daughter from his first marriage, Fanny, duchess of Choiseul-Praslin. Fanny had married Charles, duc de Praslin, in 1825. In what was one of the most famous murders of the 19th century, the duchess had been stabbed repeatedly and with noted violence. For long before her death, Fanny had accused Charles de Choiseul-Praslin of having cheated on her and of having separated her from her children. Her killing was thought to be a consequence of the Duke's plan to run away with their children's governess. Arrested and waiting to be tried by the Court of Peers, Choiseul-Praslin was released on parole, only to commit suicide on 24 August 1847; shortly before his death, he denied all charges. This event played a part in bringing about the 1848 Revolution, after public opinion began speculating that aristocrats had allowed one of their own to take his own life rather than face trial, or even that Choiseul-Praslin had been allowed to escape. As a parallel result, the 1848 events brought an end to the Sébastianis' influence in Corsica, especially after Tiburce Sébastiani chose to retire to his domain in Olmeta-di-Tuda.\n\nFour years later, Sébastiani died suddenly while having breakfast. His funeral service was held at Les Invalides and attended by President Charles-Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte among other officials of the Second Republic.\n\nHorace Sébastiani's name is inscribed on the western side of the Arc de Triomphe. An avenue in Bastia was named in his honor (\"Avenue Maréchal Sébastiani\").\n\nIn 1938, Rachel Field published her \"All This and Heaven Too\", a novel which centers on the killing of Sébastiani's daughter. The 1940 drama film of the same starred Barbara O'Neil as Fanny, Charles Boyer as De Choiseul-Praslin, and Bette Davis as Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, the governess. Sébastiani is portrayed by Montagu Love.\n\nSébastiani is also one of the protagonists in Prince Michael of Greece's novel \"Sultana - La Nuit du Sérail\", which depicts fictionalized events of Selim III's rule. In 1989, the story was later turned into an American-Swiss film co-production: titled \"The Favorite\" (or \"La Nuit du Sérail\"), it starred as Sébastiani.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2660132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2660132", "title": "Human Fly (comics)", "text": "Human Fly (comics)\n\nThe Human Fly is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. One is a super-villain that was an occasional antagonist of Spider-Man, and the other a superhero. Additionally, \"Human Fly\" was the title of a short-lived series in the late 1950s reprinting some of Fox's Blue Beetle strips from the 1940s. It was published by Super Comics.\n\nThe Human Fly first appeared in \"The Amazing Spider-Man Annual\" #10 (1976), and was created by Len Wein, Bill Mantlo, and Gil Kane. The character subsequently appears in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #192–193 (May–June 1979), \"Spider-Woman\" #30 (September 1980), \"Moon Knight\" #35 (January 1984), \"Spectacular Spider-Man\" #86 (January 1984), and \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #276 (May 1986), in which he was killed by the Scourge of the Underworld. The story of the Fly in \"Spectacular Spider-Man\" #86 was drawn by Fred Hembeck, who (in his personal caricature form) had a guest appearance in that particular issue. The Fly received an entry in the original \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\" #4, and \"The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man\" #1 (2005).\n\nThe superhero version of Human Fly starred in Marvel Comics' \"The Human Fly\" #1–19 (September 1977 – March 1979).\n\nRichard Deacon, born in Newark, New Jersey, was a small-time criminal who was shot by the police and left for dead after an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt which was foiled by Spider-Man. Stumbling into the laboratory of Dr. Harlan Stillwell (whose brother Farley Stillwell created the Scorpion for J. Jonah Jameson), Deacon coerces the scientist into saving his life. Overhearing an offer Jameson made with Stillwell to fund the creation of a new superhero, Deacon insists he be the subject of the experiment. Stillwell imprints the genetic coding of a housefly onto Deacon, empowering him and healing him of his bullet wounds. Deacon then kills Harlan Stillwell after he served his purpose and uses his newfound powers to further his criminal ambitions. He first uses Jameson as bait to get revenge on Spider-Man. Due to his inexperience, the Fly is no match for him and is defeated.\n\nSome time later, the Fly begins to display fly-like tendencies like eating garbage. He also develops physical mutations, including facet eyes. The Fly attacks Spider-Man after Spencer Smythe handcuffed him—along with Jameson—to a bomb. The Fly hurls the two from a rooftop and leaves them for dead. Once freed from the shackle, Spider-Man tries to stop the Fly from stealing an art exhibit, but the villain knocks him down and escapes. Soon afterwards, the police catch the Fly using S.H.I.E.L.D. equipment.\n\nTraveling to Los Angeles, the Fly seeks out Dr. Karl Malus, who confirms that his powers are fading and he will soon be powerless. Malus recommends that he get a new set of powers using a blood transfusion from another superbeing, which would most conveniently be the locally operating Spider-Woman. With his powers already at less than a third their usual strength, however, he is unable to defeat her and is apprehended. Afterwards, Malus uses some of the Fly's DNA to temporarily mutate Scotty McDowell into the similarly powered Hornet.\n\nThe Fly is freed from prison and his powers restored by untold means. He subsequently battles Moon Knight, leaving the hero temporarily paralyzed, and again seeks revenge against Jameson and Spider-Man. Partnered with the Black Cat, Spider-Man once more defeats the Fly.\n\nOver time, Deacon's mutation increases. After escaping from a mental institution, Deacon is killed by a Scourge of the Underworld (who was disguised as a sanitation worker) while trying to take revenge on Spider-Man.\n\nThe Human Fly is among the eighteen criminals that were murdered by Scourge of the Underworld to be resurrected by Hood using the power of Dormammu as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the Punisher. He now has acidic vomit that can melt steel and wings strong enough to deflect cannon fire and sharp enough to cut a dump truck in two. The Fly, now craving human flesh, devours a prostitute in a private room, and then fights a group of armed guards who burst in, vomiting deadly acid on them. When he assaults another woman in the hallway, the Punisher confronts him. Punisher uses his knife to cut one of Human Fly's wings in half. A group of his fellow criminals (disguised as Avengers from another time and place) intervene as Bird-Man manages to get the Human Fly to safety. His wing regenerates rather quickly. He battles the Punisher again with Letha and Lascivious, and is defeated when the Punisher throws him into Lascivious.\n\nThe Human Fly is apprehended by Agent Venom, but he is able to escape a prisoner transport to the Raft when the Hobgoblin attacks the transport trying to kill the Human Fly for stealing money from the Kingpin. Human Fly is later recruited by the third Crime Master to become a member of his Savage Six.\n\nHe is then hired by Boomerang and Owl to become a member of the Sinister Sixteen.\n\nThe second Human Fly was a young man of unknown identity who was severely injured during a car crash. After a long hospitalization, including a number of reconstructive surgeries in which much of his skeleton was replaced by steel, he took on the masked identity of the Human Fly. As the Human Fly, he performed daredevil stunts to benefit various charities, especially those helping children with disabilities.\n\nHis activities often drew him into conflict with criminals, who were often seeking to rob the charity events at which he performed. Additionally, he drew the attention of Spider-Man, who thought he might be the villain of the same name.\n\nThe character was based on real-life stuntman Rick Rojatt. The comic book carried the tag line \"The Wildest Super-Hero Ever – Because He's Real!\", and photographs of someone in a Human Fly costume appeared in the books. Jim Shooter, a high-ranking member of Marvel's editorial staff at the time of publication, said in 2007 that the photos were indeed of Rojatt.\nThe Richard Deacon version of Human Fly has the abilities of flight, wall-crawling, and superhuman strength and agility. He also has compound eyes. Following his revival at the hands of Hood, Human Fly now has acid vomit that can melt steel and wings that are strong enough to deflect cannon fire and sharp enough to cut a dump truck in two. The wings soon regenerate if they are torn off.\n\nThe superhero version of Human Fly had 60% of his bone structure replaced by steel, which allows him to withstand any injury that normal humans cannot endure. He is also a master aerialist, stuntman, hand-to-hand combatant and gymnast, and uses specialized gadgets that help him in his performances, depending on the stunt.\n\n\n\n"}

He was killed at the age of 24 in an aircraft crash in Romania during the overthrow of Communism. In his honour a scholarship fund was set up to encourage and help young photographers.\n\nParry was the youngest of four children, and was born and brought up in Prestatyn in north Wales. He attended Penmorfa County Primary and Prestatyn High Schools, and his interest in photography began while he was very young: by the age of 13 he had learned to develop and print his own film using a darkroom set up by his uncle. He took photographs of people staying at the nearby Pontin's holiday camp during the summer holidays while still at school. Parry left school at the age of 16 and was taken on by the local newspaper \"Rhyl Journal\" as a trainee photographer; the editor Brian Barratt later praised his \"nose for a good news picture\".\n\nAfter studying at the National Council for the Training of Journalists at Sheffield College, at the age of 21 Parry joined the national newspaper \"Mail on Sunday\". He later worked for both \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\". He worked with the Chief Reporter of \"Mail on Sunday\", Barbara Jones, on a front-page story about the personal life of Sonia Sutcliffe (wife of murderer Peter Sutcliffe). During the 1989 Conservative leadership election, Parry followed the challenger Sir Anthony Meyer (his local MP) throughout his challenge, photographing him throughout each day; Meyer was impressed with Parry's ability to get access to events and regarded him as \"a constant and welcome companion\".\n\nWhen an uprising against the government of Nicolae Ceaușescu broke out in Romania in December 1989, Parry was working for \"The Sunday Times\" and argued that he should be sent on assignment to cover events there. He spent several days in Bucharest taking pictures of the city recovering after Ceaușescu was overthrown, photographing soldiers with flowers in their arms, as well as funerals for people killed in the revolution. On 28 December he was returning to Britain and managed to find a place on an Antonov An-24 airliner operated by TAROM that was travelling out of Bucharest to Belgrade to pick up relief supplies. He took with him the undeveloped film from other photographers. The aircraft crashed near Găeşti, 43 miles west of Bucharest, killing all on board. An inquest in November 1990 returned an initial verdict of accidental death. Although to this day the investigation has not been officially closed, the most plausible explanation is that the plane was actually shot down by a surface-to-air missile.\n\nA memorial service for Parry was held at St Bride's Church in Fleet Street on 30 January 1990. A photograph by Parry of the funeral of a young Romanian killed in the revolution won the Nikon Press Photograph of the Month for January 1990; the picture editor of the Press Association selected it as the winner because \"it summed up better than anything the whole story of Romania and the terrible legacy of sadness inflicted on ordinary Romanians by the Ceaușescus\".\n\nAfter Parry's death, the Picture Editor of \"The Sunday Times\" Aidan Sullivan worked with Parry's family and friends and set up the Ian Parry Scholarship Fund. The fund announced in September 1990 that it would offer photographers aged up to 24 funding of £1,000 plus a further £1,000 for equipment to cover a foreign assignment of their choice.\n\n"}

{"id": "2525278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2525278", "title": "John Rollin Ridge", "text": "John Rollin Ridge\n\nJohn Rollin Ridge (Cherokee name: Cheesquatalawny, or Yellow Bird, March 19, 1827 – October 5, 1867), a member of the Cherokee Nation, is considered the first Native American novelist.\n\nBorn in New Echota, Georgia, he was the son of John Ridge, and the grandson of Major Ridge, both of whom were signatories to the Treaty of New Echota, which Congress affirmed in early 1836, ceding Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi River and ultimately leading to the Trail of Tears. At the age of twelve, Ridge witnessed his father's death at the hands of supporters of Cherokee leader John Ross, who had vehemently opposed the treaty. His mother, Sarah Bird Northrup (a white woman), took him and fled to Fayetteville, Arkansas. In 1843, he was sent to the Great Barrington School in Great Barrington, Massachusetts for two years, after which he returned to Fayetteville to study law. It was during this period that his first known writing appeared in print. He published a poem, \"To a Thunder Cloud,\" in the \"Arkansas State Gazette\". He married Elizabeth Wilson, a white woman, in 1847. They had one daughter, Alice, in 1848.\n\nIn 1849, he killed Ross sympathizer David Kell, whom he thought had been involved with his father's assassination, over a horse dispute. Despite having a good argument for self-defense, he fled to Missouri to avoid prosecution. The next year, he joined in the California Gold Rush, but disliked being a miner. While there, he was reunited with his wife and daughter.\n\nHis writing career began with poetry (published posthumously) and essays for the Democratic Party before what is now considered the first Native American novel and the first novel written in California, \"The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta: The Celebrated California Bandit\" (1854). A fictionalized version of the notorious bandit's story, the tale describes a young Mexican who comes to California to seek his fortune during the Gold Rush and turns to crime after his wife is raped and his brother murdered by white men. This novel, which condemned American racism especially towards Mexicans, later inspired the Zorro stories. Although widely popular, Ridge saw no money from the book's publication—by the time of his death it had not yet even turned a profit.\n\nRidge was a writer and the first editor of the \"Sacramento Bee\" and also wrote for the \"San Francisco Herald\", among other publications. As an editor, he advocated assimilationist policies for American Indians as his father had, placing his trust in the federal government to protect their rights. At the same time, however, he was blind to the ways in which those rights were continually abused by the same government. Despite his novel's stance against racism, Ridge had owned slaves on his Arkansas property and felt that California Indians were inferior to those of other tribes. During the Civil War, Ridge openly supported the \"Copperheads\" and opposed both the election of Abraham Lincoln as well as the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, blaming the war on abolitionists.\n\nAfter the war, Ridge was invited by the federal government to head the Southern Cherokee delegation in postwar treaty proceedings. Despite his best efforts, the Cherokee region was not admitted as a state to the Union. In December 1866, he returned to his home in Grass Valley, California, where he died of \"brain fever\" (\"Encephalitis lethargica\") on October 5, 1867. He was buried at Greenwood Memorial Park in Grass Valley.\n\nRidge's novel, one of the earliest by a Native American author, is curious both because it is written not about a Native American subject, but about a Mexican immigrant, and because it is not original but based on a legendary figure widely discussed in the media of the day. Ridge presents the figure of Joaquin Murieta as that of a young, innocent and industrious man who is hampered in his attempts to be successful in the United States by the racism of the people and by the 1850 Foreign Miner's Tax Law, which severely hampered the ability of Latinos to mine for gold. Ridge's version of Murieta becomes a bandit who attracts a large number of associates and who terrorizes the state of California for several months with his gruesome acts of violence. At the same time, Ridge's Murieta is a romantic figure, often showing kindness (especially to women) and relishing the stories about him, even as he keeps his identity so well secret that he can walk through town in broad daylight with no one recognizing him.\n\nAlthough the novel is fictional, many people took it as fact and some historians even cited it when writing biographical materials on Murrieta.\n\n\n"}

The current prize is $625,000 paid over five years in quarterly installments. This figure was increased from $500,000 in 2013 with the release of a review of the MacArthur Fellows Program. Since 1981, 942 people have been named MacArthur Fellows, ranging in age from 18 to 82. The award has been called \"one of the most significant awards that is truly 'no strings attached'\".\n\nThe Program allows no applications. Anonymous and confidential nominations are invited by the Foundation and reviewed by an anonymous and confidential selection committee of about a dozen people. The committee reviews all nominees and recommends recipients to the President and board of directors. Most new Fellows first learn of their nomination and award upon receiving a congratulatory phone call.

The first article declares invalid the elections June and July 1910 for president, vice president, magistrates to the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, deputies and senators. In the second article he disowned the government of Porfirio Díaz and all the authorities unelected by the people.\n\nThe 3º article declares that the law on uncultivated land took advantage of small landowners, and mostly dispossessed indigenous people arbitrarily. Madero proposes in the name of justice restore to the ancient possessors and demand to those who purchased of immoral form those lands, call to return them to their primitive owners in addition to paying them a compensation by the suffered damages. Only in the case that these lands have been sold to third persons before the promulgation of this plan, the ancient owners will receive compensation of those in whose profit verified the undress.\n\nOne of the articles with more impact in this Manifest it is the 4º, where it is declared as \"Supreme Law of the Republic\" the principle of NO-REELECTION of the president and vice-president of the Republic, governors of the states and municipal presidents.\n\nIn the 5th article of this manifest, Madero assumes the charge of provisional president of the Mexican United States, calling for extraordinary elections a month afterwards, when the half of the States of the Federation are in power of the people, promising give the power to the president that results elect.

Known as \"The Werewolf\" and the \"Angarsk maniac\"—termed as one of Russia's most prolific serial killers—for the brutal nature of his crimes, Popkov was convicted of 22 murders in 2015 and confessed to 59 additional homicides three years later. The killings, if confirmed, supersede that of the country's most notorious serial killer Andrei Chikatilo.\n\nMikhail Popkov was born in Angarsk on 7 March 1964. Little is known about his upbringing and personal life beyond that he is married and has one daughter. He worked as a police officer in the Irkutsk region, and by the time of his capture had also spent time as a security guard at the Angarsk Oil and Chemical Company, as well as at a private firm.\n\nPopkov's crimes were motivated by suspicions that his wife had committed adultery. Most, if not all, his victims were prostitutes or inebriated young women—people who Popkov considered immoral—between the ages of 17 and 38. At various points between 1992 and 2010 in Angarsk, Irkutsk, and Vladivostok—‌a distance of some 3,900 km (2,423 mi)—‌Popkov, dressed in his police uniform, lured victims with the promise of a free ride and sexually assaulted them. He killed women with various instruments—‌knives, axes, baseball bats, screwdrivers—‌and mutilated the bodies so grotesquely that Russian media ascribed the crimes to \"The Werewolf\" and the \"Angarsk maniac\".\n\nRussian police were involved in the search for one perpetrator as slain women were discovered in the mid-1990s, killed by similar methods. Despite extensive inquiries and testimonies from surviving victims, Popkov eluded police for two decades. However, investigators discovered a pattern: tracks from a LADA 4x4, an off-road vehicle used by law enforcement, were found at numerous crime scenes. DNA testings of 3,500 current and former policemen in Irkutsk in 2012 facilitated Popkov's capture that same year. In January 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison for 22 murders and two attempted murders. Two years later, Popkov confessed to 59 additional killings, a total count which, if confirmed, supersedes infamous Russian serial killers Andrei Chikatilo and Alexander Pichushkin.\n"}

{"id": "55055039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55055039", "title": "Qahtan (tribe)", "text": "Qahtan (tribe)\n\n\"Not to be confused with the Qahtanite peoples\"\n\nQahtān (, also spelled as ) to distinguish between the tribe and the Qahtanite peoples, is an Arab tribal confederation. Qahtan is composed of three main tribes: Sanhan, Junb, and Rufaida. Today, members of the tribe and its sub-tribes are based in Saudi Arabia (where most of the tribe is congregated), Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. One must note that the Madh'hiji Qahtan tribe is different from the Qahtanite peoples, because while all members of the Qahtan identify as Qahtanite through their ancestry to Qahtan son of Hud which the tribe is named after, not all Qahtanite tribes (such as Shammar, Sharhan, Harb, etc.) trace their ancestry back to the modern tribe known as \"Qahtan\".\n\nQahtan's sheikhdom was unanimously agreed by Western historians to be in the hands of the 'Al Qarmalah' family of the Jahader clan in the 19th century, and as early as 1961, the paramount sheikh of Qahtan was reported to be 'Khalil ibn Nasir ibn Qarmalah' (a descendant of Hadi ibn Qarmalah). However today, this subject of whether the Al Qarmalah family or the Ibn Dulaim family of the Sharif clan are the rightful sheikhs of Qahtan is highly controversial and has led to physical confrontations in high profile tribal Qahtan congregations. Regardless, Abdullah ibn Fahad ibn Dulaim, sheikh of the Ibn Dulaim family, is recognized by the Saudi state as the appointed paramount sheikh of Qahtan and its allied tribe of Wadi'a.\n\nThe Qahtan tribe enjoyed priority rights and control to southern Najd for a period generally agreed to have spanned 90 years, paying suzerainty only to Ibn Saud. Tribes who migrated to Najd during spring or winter to herd their cattle were required to pay taxation in order for them to be allowed to graze their livestock in the Qahtani diyar (territory) in Najd. Several historians have described Qahtan as \"the most powerful\" tribe or \"nobody dared to challenge them\" during this era.\n\nThe \"Jahader\" branch of the Sanhan sub-tribe of Qahtan migrated to southern Najd from their homelands in Asir Region during the late 18th century and early 19th century under the leadership of Athfar al-Amaaj, driving out the Mutair tribe from Najd after refusing to pay taxation to Mutair in exercising their rights to herding camels and cattle in Najd. After Qahtan's victory over Mutair, a previously unknown member of the Jahader known as Hadi ibn Qurmula visited Ibn Saud whom he convinced to grant him the sheikhdom of Qahtan. This began the 90 year rule of Al Qurmula over Najd, beginning with Hadi ibn Qurmula and culminating with his son Muhammad ibn Hadi ibn Qurmula. .\n\nThe Qahtan tribe is subdivided into three major branches: Sanhan سنحان, Junb جنب and Rufaida رفيدة each major branch is divided into many clans, each clan is divided into various families.\n\n\nMost Qahtanite tribes in Iraq (such as Shemmar, Dulaim, Juboor, etc.) do not belong to the Madh'hiji tribe of Qahtan. However, few tribes belonging to the aforementioned Madh'hiji tribe of Qahtan are present in Iraq, a prominent example being the Kobaisat tribal confederation. The Kobaisat (al-Kobaisi) migrated from Tathlith, modern southern Saudi Arabia in the 16th century and settled in Iraq. By the 18th century, many of the Kobaisat migrated to the growing pearl towns of northern Qatar and are a prominent tribe today in that country. The Kobaisat today in Iraq are a large tribal confederation that was also joined by non-Kobaisat tribes such as al-Buhaidar and al-Durai'at, and have formed their own town known as \"Kobaisa\". It must be noted that the Kobaisat are entirely independent from Qahtan and the only aspect linking the two tribes together today is ancestry. Some well known members of the Kobaisat tribe are Iraqi religious scholar Mohammed Alkobaisi and Ahmed al-Kobaisi, the latter whom is most famous for participating in anti-Salafist debate shows.\n\nIn Kuwait, Qahtan and its sub-tribe Bani Hajir have formed a well known alliance in National Assembly elections, being a part of the tribal bloc. The Bani Hajir are among the largest tribal blocs to participate in the Kuwait National Assembly elections, consisting of 8150 voters in the 2016 election.\n\nQahtan, specifically the Bani Hajer tribe, has taken a very prominent role in the Qatar peninsula ever since their migration to that country in the 18th century. The Bani Hajers were infamous in the 19th century for their nomadic lifestyle, political and tribal alliances, and piratical activities in the Persian Gulf. In fact, the vast majority of Bani Hajer inhabited the Qatar peninsula until around 1900 when most of the tribe migrated west to modern day Saudi Arabia in Al-Ahsa and Jubail after a dispute with the ruling Qatari Al Thani family. As a result of their loyalty and military service to Al Saud, in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia, the Bani Hajers were awarded settlement rights in an area known today as \"Jawf Bani Hajer\", and there they also established several hijras. Branches of Qahtan such as al-Habab (known as al-Ehbabi in Qatar) also have a presence in that country but their fame is not nearly as recognized as that of Bani Hajer. Perhaps the most recognized Hajri personality in Qatar would be Mozah Al Mesned, the mother of the current Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who belongs to the Al Muhannada branch of the Bani Hajer.\n\nBahrain is a Gulf country that houses the tiniest number of Qahtanis compared to other Gulf countries, however, some members of the tribe have taken a relatively prominent role in the country. For example, the head of the Sunni Waqf Endowment Directorate is Rashid al-Hajri, a member of the Bani Hajer. Offshoot Hajri families such Almuhannada also take a public role such as former Member of Parliament Hamad Almuhannadi.\n\nQahtan takes a noteworthy role in the United Arab Emirates, which however is not as large as Kuwait or Qatar. For example, a member of the Advisory Council to the Government of Sharjah is Abdulqader al-Hajri, a member of Bani Hajer. The Bani Hajer were also historically allied with the al-Manasir tribe, which sometimes may claim descent from Bani Hajer based on their historical alliance. Smaller families of Qahtan such as \"al-Ehbabi\" are also present in the country.\n\n"}

He was born and raised in Alton, Illinois.\n\nWadlow reached in height and weighed at his death at age 22. His great size and his continued growth in adulthood were due to hyperplasia of his pituitary gland, which results in an abnormally high level of human growth hormone (HGH). He showed no indication of an end to his growth even at the time of his death.\n\nWadlow was born in Alton, Illinois, on February 22, 1918, to Harold Franklin and Addie May (Johnson) Wadlow, and was the oldest of five children. He was taller than his father by the age of 8, and in elementary school they had to make a special desk for him due to his size. By the time he had graduated from Alton High School in 1936, he was . After graduating he enrolled in Shurtleff College with the intention of studying law.\n\nWadlow's size began to take its toll: he required leg braces to walk and had little feeling in his legs and feet. Despite these difficulties, he never used a wheelchair.\n\nWadlow became a celebrity after his 1936 U.S. tour with the Ringling Brothers Circus. He appeared with Ringling Brothers at Madison Square Garden and the Boston Garden in the center ring, never in the sideshow. During his appearances, he was dressed in his normal clothes and refused Circus request to wear a top hat and tails.\n\nIn 1938, he did a promotional tour with the International Shoe Company. They provided him his shoes free of charge. Examples of the shoes still exist in several locations throughout the U.S., including Snyder's Shoe Store of Ludington and Manistee, Michigan, and the Alton Museum of History and Art. He continued participating in tours and public appearances, though only in his normal street clothes. Wadlow rationalized that he was working in advertising, not being exhibited as a freak. He possessed great physical strength until the last year of his life, when his strength and his health in general began to deteriorate rapidly.\n\nWadlow was a member of the Order of DeMolay, the Masonic-sponsored organization for young men. He was also a Freemason. In 1939, he petitioned Franklin Lodge #25 in Alton, Illinois, and by late November of that year was raised to the degree of Master Mason under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Illinois A.F. and A.M.. His Freemason ring was the largest ever made.\n\nOne year before his death, Wadlow passed John Rogan as the tallest person ever. On June 27, 1940 (18 days before his death), he was measured at by doctors C. M. Charles and Cyril MacBryde of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nOn July 4, 1940, during a professional appearance at the Manistee National Forest Festival, a faulty brace irritated his ankle, causing a blister and subsequent infection. Doctors treated him with a blood transfusion and emergency surgery, but his condition worsened due to an autoimmune disorder, and on July 15, 1940, 11 days after contracting the infection, he died in his sleep at the age of 22. His coffin measured long by wide by deep, weighed over , and was carried by twelve pallbearers and eight assistants. His body was buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Upper Alton, Madison County, Illinois.\n\nA life-size statue of Wadlow stands on College Avenue in Alton, opposite the Alton Museum of History and Art. It was erected in 1986, in honor of the well-known native. Others stand in the Guinness Museums in Niagara Falls, Ontario and Gatlinburg, Tennessee, as well as several of the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museums. A group of six life-size models of him, made by artist James Butler, exist, and are shipped and displayed in replica caskets.\n\nAnother life-size statue of Wadlow may be viewed at Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum in Farmington Hills, Michigan. In front of it is a small, quarter-operated \"TV-box\", which plays a short, documentary movie about his extraordinary short life.\n\nWadlow is still affectionately known as the \"Gentle Giant\".\n\nThe 1998 song \"The Giant of Illinois\", by The Handsome Family (and later covered by Andrew Bird) honors Wadlow. In 2005, Sufjan Stevens recorded \"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders\" about Wadlow for the \"Illinois\" album. A picture of Wadlow with his family is featured on the back cover of the VHS version of the Talking Heads music video compilation, \"Storytelling Giant\".\n\n\n\n"}

He was a corresponding member of the Lisbon Academy of Sciences, elected on July 27, 1911.He also became widely renowned during his lifetime as a Konkani language scholar.\n\nSebastião Rodolfo Dalgado, was born in Assagao, Bardez, Goa, to a Goan Catholic family of the Bamonn caste. He had six brothers and a sister. The family's pre-conversion surname was Desai, replaced by the Portuguese surname Dalgado, after conversion to Christianity.\n\nThe second son of Ambrose Dalgado, a landowner in Bardez, and Florinda Rosa de Souza, he had six brothers and one sister. Among the siblings were Daniel Gelásio Dalgado, a medical director of the health services from Sawantwadi and an eminent botanist; Patrocínio Dalgado, ophthalmologist; and Eduardo Dalgado, a lawyer in Lisbon.\n\nAfter completing his elementary studies in Assagao, the young Dalgado completed his secondary education in Mapusa and joined the Rachol Seminary, near Margao, from where he was ordained a priest in 1881. \n\nConsidered the best student of his course, he was selected for further studies and then went on to Rome, where he enrolled at the Seminary of St. Apollinaris.\n\nIn Rome his doctorate was in Canon Law and Roman Law.\n\nAfter a brief stay in Lisbon in 1884, he returned to Goa as a missionary, where the then Patriarch of the East Indies, Don António Sebastião Valente, appointed him as the inspector of schools and workshops of the Padroado do Oriente and as a professor of Scripture and Canon Law at the Seminary of Rachol, where he formerly studied. He also functioned as an ecclesiastical judge in Goa.\n\nSubsequently, he was intensely involved in religious activity in India, and then became vicar general of the island of Ceylon, particularly of the Portuguese mission in the city of Colombo, which had been abolished by Concordat of 1886.\n\nLater, he served at Calcutta, where he founded a school for girls and a dispensary for the poor in Nagori, and Dhaka.\n\nAll this activity enabled him to forge close contacts with various language communities, thus allowing him to acquire a mastery of several Indian languages, including Malayalam, Kannada, Tamil, Marathi, Sinhala and Bengali. Learning some of these languages was made easier due to his deep knowledge of Sanskrit. \n\nBetween 1893 and 1895 he was vicar-general in Honnavar, today in the State of Karnataka. There he served a community of Konkani and Kannada speakers, the latter being a language he learnt. It took some time in Sawantwadi, with his brother Gelasius Dalgado, who was a doctor there, for him to learn other dialects of Konkani.\n\nWhen he was vicar general of Ceylon, he declined to accept the bishop's mitre that the Congregation of Propaganda Fide had offered him, probably in the context of the dispute between Portugal and the Holy See on the extent and powers of the Patronage of the East (Padroado).\n\nDuring his stay in Ceylon, he wrote several sermons and homilies in the Indo-Portuguese dialect of Ceylon. His other work included \"The Indo-Portuguese Dialect of Ceylon,\" published in 1900 in \"Contributions of the Geographical Society of Lisbon\", done in commemoration of the centenary of the European discovery of sea route to India.\n\nHis first published work was the first part of \"Konkani-Portuguese Dictionary\", written using the Devanagari alphabet and the Roman script, and which was published in 1893 in the city of Bombay, now known as Mumbai. \n\nIn 1895 he settled in Lisbon, where he completed the publication of the \"Konkani-Portuguese Dictionary\" (which was out in 1905) and devoted himself to study the influence of English on the languages of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn view of its studies published, in 1907 he was appointed Professor of Sanskrit in the Curso Superior de Letras, which was founded in 1859 by D. Pedro V in Lisbon. This institution later on went on to become the nucleus of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Lisbon.\n\nIn 1911 he was elected corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, and received the title of \"Doutor em Letras\", which was granted by the Council of the Faculty of Arts of Lisbon (\"Conselho da Faculdade de Letras de Lisboa\").\n\nHe suffered from diabetes, which ultimately resulted in the amputation of both his legs (in 1911 and 1915.) From that point onwards, Dalgado used a wheelchair.\n\nBecause of his handicap, the Faculty of Humanities granted him the privilege of performing his duties from his home, where his students gathered around him to hear his lessons. He also undertook the daily celebration of Mass in his wheelchair, with special religious permission.\n\nWhen he died, on 4 April 1922, his funeral rites reflected the wide prestige that had won. In attendance were the Patriarch of Lisbon, the Apostolic Nuncio in Lisbon, the Minister of Education and representatives of colleges and academies of Lisbon.\n\nThe funeral eulogy was delivered by Canon José de Santa Rita e Sousa, professor of the \"Escola Superior Colonial\", where he taught the chair of Konkani language. The press coverage was large, reflecting throughout the Lusophone world.\n\nHe was an eminent philologist, publishing, among other works, the \"Glossário Luso-Asiático\" in two volumes, full-text versions of which are available online today. He was also the author of outstanding works in the field of Portuguese Orientalism such as \"The Indo-Portuguese dialect of Ceylon\"; \"Konkani-Portuguese Dictionary\"; \"The Indo-Portuguese dialect of Mumbai and suburbs\"; \"Influencia do vocabulário português em línguas asiáticas\" (The Influence of Portuguese Vocables in Asian Languages); \"The Indo-Portuguese Dialects of Goa, Daman and Ceylon\"; \"Fundamentals of the Sanskrit language\", and \"Indian Proverbs\".\n\nHis works have earned high praise, including that of Dr. Gonçalves Viana who appreciated his work \"The Influence of Portuguese Vocables in Asian Languages\" and said \"that perhaps no other wise person, Portuguese or foreign, could carry it out satisfactorily\".\n\nThe Brazilian philologist Dr. Solidonio Leite said that \"Monsignor Dalgado could undertake and carry out those works that attest to exceptional value of this great man\".\n\nIn recognition of his work in 1904, he received the honour of honorary chaplain of the Pope's \"extra urbem\", with the right to use the title of \"Monsignor\". He was a member of the Lisbon Geographic Society (1895), a member of the Institute of Coimbra (1896), Doctor \"Honoris Causa\" from the Faculty of Arts, University of Lisbon (1911), corresponding member Academy of Sciences (1911) and its member (1922) and a member of the Royal Asiatic Society in London (1921).\n\nIn 1922, the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon, which bequeathed the 300 documents that constitute the Monsignor Dalgado Fund, admitted him posthumously as a member. Along with Shenoi Goembab and Joaquim Heliodoró da Cunha Rivara, Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado is widely considered to be a pioneer in the defence of the Konkani language.\n\nThe city of Lisbon honoured him with a place named after him, to a wide locality in the parish of São Domingos de Benfica. In 1955 the \"Correios do Estado da Índia\" (postal department of the Estado da Índia) issued a postage stamp of a one real denomination, to mark the centenary of the birth of Monsignor Sebastiao Rodolfo Delgado, accompanied by a postcard with his photograph.\n\nIn 1989, the Goan state capital of Panjim saw the creation of the Dalgado Konkani Academy, an academy to promote the use of the Konkani language in the Latin alphabet (the \"Konkani Romi lipi\"). The Dalgado Konkani Academy has also established the Monsignor Sebastiao Rudolfo Dalgado Award to be awarded annually for activities to promote the study and use of Konkani.\n\n\n"}

He served in the Revolutionary War, first in the North Carolina militia and then as part of general Nathanael Greene's campaign.\n\nFollowing the war, Allin settled in the Kentucky district of Virginia. He participated in the Northwest Indian War, fighting with future Kentucky governor Charles Scott. He then became the surveyor for the Transylvania Company, laying out the towns of Harrodsburg and Henderson. He served for many years as county clerk and circuit court clerk in Mercer County, Kentucky. He was succeeded in these offices by two of his sons. He died of cholera on June 26, 1833.\n\nThomas Allin was born the son of William and Frances (Grant) Allin in Hanover County, Virginia on May 14, 1757. The following year, the family moved to Granville County, North Carolina, where Allin was raised on the family farm.\n\nAllin enlisted as a private in the North Carolina militia shortly after the beginning of the Revolutionary War. Later, he served in the army of general Nathaneal Greene and participated in the Battle of Guilford Courthouse.\n\nAllin's first visit to Kentucky was in 1780. In 1781, he moved to St. Asaph's (now Stanford) in Lincoln County. He was chosen as deputy surveyor for Lincoln County, and in 1782, he became the county's deputy sheriff. He held both positions until approximately 1786. He surveyed the land for the site of what is now Lexington, Kentucky, and as compensation, received the land that Newport, Kentucky now occupies. He later lost this land in a lawsuit.\n\nAs a captain in the Northwest Indian War, Allin commanded a company of mounted infantry under General Charles Scott in Indiana, and participated in the Battle of Tippecanoe.

Both Allin and his wife were both members of the Christian Church.\n\nAllin was invited to become a member of the Danville Political Club at the Club's second meeting, and served as its treasurer and secretary \"pro tempore\". He was also a charter member of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge in 1787. In August 1799, He represented Mercer County at Kentucky's second constitutional convention.\n\nAllin was the surveyor for the Transylvania Company, and laying out the site of the city of Henderson, Kentucky in 1797. He also helped lay out the town of Harrodsburg, Kentucky, and served as clerk of its board of trustees from March 24, 1786 to May 4, 1816. In 1811, he was elected surveyor for the town of Danville. In addition to surveying, he operated a farm, a mill, and a distillery.\n\nAllin resigned as circuit court clerk in 1825 and as county clerk in 1831. His son, Ben, succeeded him in the former office, and his son, Thomas, Jr., succeeded him in the latter. He died of cholera on June 26, 1833 and was buried in Springhill Cemetery in Harrodsburg.\n\n\n"}

He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nBorn in New York City, Akin grew up in the Greater St. Louis area. After receiving his bachelor's degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, Akin served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and worked in the private sector in the computer and steel industries. In 1988, he was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. He served in the state house until 2000, when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, in which he served until 2013.\n\nAkin's Congressional career ended after he lost a bid to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill in the 2012 election. Akin, who had won the Republican primary in a crowded field, led McCaskill in pre-election polls until he said that women who are victims of what he called \"legitimate rape\" rarely get pregnant. Akin eventually apologized for the remark but rebuffed calls to withdraw from the election. He lost to McCaskill by 54.7 percent to 39.2 percent. In a book published in July 2014, Akin said that he regretted apologizing and defended his original comments.\n\nAkin was born in New York City, and raised in the St. Louis area. He is the son of Nancy Perry (née Bigelow) and Paul Bigelow Akin.\n\nAkin's great-grandfather, Thomas Russell Akin, founded Laclede Steel Corporation of St. Louis in 1911. The company eventually passed to his grandfather, William Akin, and then to his father Paul, a third-generation graduate of Harvard University who served as an officer in the Navy during World War II.\n\nAkin graduated from John Burroughs School, a private prep school in suburban St. Louis, and went on to attend Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, earning a B.S. in Management Engineering in 1970.\n\nAfter graduation, Akin served as an engineer officer in the National Guard of the U.S. Army, then served in the Army Reserve until 1980. After leaving active duty, Akin sold large computer systems for IBM, then worked as a manager in his family's steel business.\n\nAkin earned a Master of Divinity degree in 1984 from Covenant Theological Seminary where he studied Greek, Hebrew, and a socially conservative interpretation of the Christian scriptures. He did not enter the ministry.\n\nAkin is a longtime pro-life activist and former member of the board of Missouri Right to Life. He was arrested for trespass at least eight times between 1985 and 1988 while demonstrating against abortion in front of abortion clinics in Illinois and Missouri. He has said the protests were peaceful and he would not apologize for standing up for his beliefs. At the time of the arrests, he was using the name \"William Akin\"; after that period, when he ran for political office, it was as \"Todd Akin\".\n\nAkin was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in November 1988, running unopposed to represent District 85 in West County. He won re-election in 1990 with 59% of the vote. Due to re-districting, Akin represented District 86 from 1993 through 2000, never winning less than 66% of the vote.\n\nAkin served as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. During his 12 years in the state house, Akin advocated for homeschool rights, voted for carrying concealed weapons, voted against the parks and soils sales tax, and voted against the 1993 tax increase and education spending increase. Akin sponsored legislation to prohibit casino companies from contributing to Missouri state lawmakers. In 1995, he fought Democratic Governor Mel Carnahan over a bill providing state funding for school nurses. Ultimately, the governor refused to sign the funding bill due to Akin's amendment, which would have prohibited nurses from telling students about sources for information about abortion.\n\nIn 2000, Akin ran in the Republican primary election to fill the House seat vacated by U.S. Representative Jim Talent, who was running for governor. Light voter turnout caused by heavy rains helped Akin win the tight, five-way primary by just 56 votes; he defeated two better-known candidates, former St. Louis County Executive Gene McNary and State Senator Franc Flotron. On the night he won the primary, Akin said, \"My base will show up in earthquakes.\" He defeated Democratic State Senator Ted House in the general election, winning 55 percent of the vote. He never faced another contest as close, and was reelected five times. In 2010, Akin won re-election with 67.9% of the vote. He had been challenged for the seat by Democratic nominee Arthur Lieber, Libertarian nominee Steve Mosbacher, and write-in candidate Patrick M. Cannon.\n\nAkin earned a 96% rating from the American Conservative Union in 2008, and 100% in 2007.\n\nFor most of his tenure, Akin was listed in the official House roll as \"R-St. Louis,\" even though his district didn't include any portion of the city of St. Louis.\n\nAkin is an outspoken opponent of abortion in all cases, including health reasons or in cases of rape or incest, and he opposes embryonic stem cell research. In a 2008 speech on the House floor, Akin called abortion providers \"terrorists\" and alleged that it was \"common practice\" for abortion providers to perform \"abortions\" on women who were not actually pregnant.\n\nAkin is a supporter of the right to keep and bear arms and has an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association. Akin has stated that he has supported many bills including the Second Amendment Sovereignty Act of 2012, The Sportsmen's Heritage Act and the Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act. Akin is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he co-sponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.\n\nAkin also authored the Protect the Pledge (of Allegiance) Act. In late June 2011, Akin objected to NBC's recent removal of the words \"under God\" from a video clip of school children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. After remarking that \"NBC has a long record of being very liberal,\" Akin said, \"at the heart of liberalism really is a hatred for God and a belief that government should replace God\". Two days later, Akin said he did not mean all liberals hate God, only that liberals have \"a hatred for public references for God.\" The next day, he apologized, saying his statement had been \"directed at the political movement, Liberalism, not at any specific individual\".\n\nDuring his 2012 US Senate bid, Akin reaffirmed his opposition to legislation like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which he voted against as a Congressman.\n\nTodd Akin is an opponent of the No Child Left Behind Act. Akin believes that it should not be the federal government that decides on education, but that local government should have control over public education.\n\nOn MSNBC, Todd Akin opposes evolution. He was running for the senate seat in Missouri at the time. He has said \"I take a look at both sides of the thing and it seems to me that evolution takes a tremendous amount of faith. I don't even see it as a matter of science because I don't know if you can prove...\".\n\nIn his early years in Congress, Akin brought back earmarks for his district, voted to raise the debt ceiling, voted for off-balance-sheet wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and voted to create the unfunded Medicare prescription drug benefit. More recently, he has opposed increases in taxation and spending. He voted in 2007 against an expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), objecting to its potential coverage of children in families making up to $62,000 a year, and stating that proof of U.S. citizenship was not required. He also said the bill would \"weaken the private health care system\" and lead the country \"further down the slippery slope to socialized medicine.\" He has voted against federally funded school breakfasts and lunches, and called student loans \"a stage-three cancer of socialism\". He has also voted against increasing the minimum wage. He was a vocal critic of the September 2008 bank bailout, and voted against it. He voted no on the Affordable Health Care Act in March 2010, and on Paul Ryan's fiscal year 2012 budget.\n\nAkin has spent time working on military and veterans issues. On the House Armed Services Committee he served as the Chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, which handles Navy and Air Force issues. He has served as Ranking Republican on the Seapower Subcommittee and the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. Akin has also introduced veterans-related bills, most notably the Open Burn Pit Registry Act, which creates a registry for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who were exposed to burn pits. He opposed repeal of the Dover Policy, which banned media coverage of caskets of troops returning home from overseas, citing privacy and decorum issues.\n\n\n\nIn mid-May 2011, Akin announced he would seek the Republican nomination in 2012 to unseat Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill. Other candidates in the August 2012 Republican primary included businessman John Brunner, author and business executive Mark Memoly, and former Missouri Treasurer Sarah Steelman who had backing from the TEA Party.\nDespite losing some momentum and in a crowded field, Akin won the Republican nomination in the August 7 open primary, 36% to 30% for his nearest challenger. The Claire McCaskill campaign spent $2 million during the primaries, despite not having a primary opponent. That money was spent on advertising touting Akin as \"Too conservative,\" for Missouri. In 2012, \"National Journal\" named Akin one of ten Republicans to follow on Twitter.\n\nAkin faced McCaskill and Libertarian nominee Jonathan Dine in the general election, losing to McCaskill after his controversial comments on rape lost him a great deal of support.\n\nIn May 2011, questions were raised about Akin's official address for voting. For most of his political career, Akin had claimed Town and Country as his official residence. However, according to the Associated Press and the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", Akin moved to Wildwood, in far western St. Louis County, sometime between 2007 and 2009, after he and his wife purchased a second home there. However, he continued to vote as a Town and Country resident, and signed a polling place logbook attesting to his living there in April 2011.\n\nIn a local news interview, on August 19, 2012, discussing abortion, Akin claimed that victims of what he described as \"legitimate rape\" very rarely become pregnant. Airing on St. Louis television station KTVI, his response to a question on rape exceptions for abortion was:\n\nWell you know, people always want to try to make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\nBut let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.\n\nThe comments from Akin, which came as he ran for the U.S. Senate seat held by Claire McCaskill, almost immediately led to widespread uproar. The term \"legitimate rape\" was called \"loathsome\" because it suggests that \"there are different categories of rape — some real and awful and others that are not\". Others took exception to the phrasing because it suggests that the victims who do become pregnant from rape may be lying. His claims about the likelihood of pregnancy resulting from rape were seen by some as being based on fringe ideas like stress-induced miscarriage or Dr. John C. Willke's \"spastic tubes\" theory introduced in 1985 and trauma-based theory introduced in 1999. These theories are not accepted by the majority of the scientific and medical community. Akin was not the first to make such claims, but was perhaps one of the most recently prominent.\n\nThe comment was widely characterized as misogynistic and recklessly inaccurate, with many commentators remarking on the use of the words \"legitimate rape\". Related news articles cited a 1996 article in an obstetrics and gynecology journal, which found that 5% of women who were raped became pregnant, which equaled about 32,000 pregnancies each year in the US alone. A separate 2003 article in the journal \"Human Nature\" estimated that rapes are twice as likely to result in pregnancies as consensual sex.\n\nWhile some colleagues such as Iowa congressman Steve King and Tennessee state senator Stacey Campfield supported Akin, senior figures in both parties condemned his remarks and some Republicans called for him to resign. In the resulting furor, Akin received widespread calls to drop out of his Senate race from both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nAkin apologized for his gaffe, saying he \"misspoke.\" His campaign ran an advertisement in which he asked voters to forgive him, saying:\n\nRape is an evil act. I used the wrong words in the wrong way and for that I apologize. As the father of two daughters, I want tough justice for predators. I have a compassionate heart for the victims of sexual assault. I pray for them. The fact is, rape can lead to pregnancy. The truth is, rape has many victims. The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold. I ask for your forgiveness.\n\nThe incident was seen as having an impact on Akin's senate race and the Republicans' chances of gaining a majority in the U.S. Senate, by making news in the week before the 2012 Republican National Convention and by \"shift[ing] the national discussion to divisive social issues that could repel swing voters rather than economic issues that could attract them\".\n\nBefore the comments, Akin had been favored to win his race against McCaskill, but he lost in November, 54.7 percent to 39.2 percent. His loss was attributed to backlash from women voters. After the election, between November 2012 and August 2013, Akin received $111,000 in donations that in part were for the 2018 Senate primaries.\n\nIn July 2014, Akin's book, \"Firing Back: Taking on the Party Bosses and Media Elite to Protect Our Faith and Freedom\", was published by WND Books. In it, he said that he regretted apologizing, because \"by asking the public at large for forgiveness, I was validating the willful misinterpretation of what I had said.\" He also defended his original comments and attacked various Republicans for \"wronging\" him, including Karl Rove; former National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Rob Jesmer; Senators Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, John McCain, Roy Blunt and Lindsey Graham; and House Speaker John Boehner. He also repeatedly attacked the Republican establishment for seeing his comments \"as their opportunity to take [me] out and select someone more palatable to their tastes\", and the \"liberal media\" for making him \"the target of a media assassination.\"\n\nAkin married Lulli Boe, a graduate of Hollins University, in June 1975. The couple has six children. Lulli became a home schooling activist, and all of the children were home-schooled. Three sons attended the Naval Academy and became officers in the Marines. One of his sons served in the assault on Fallujah, Iraq.\n\nAkin enjoys playing guitar and singing gospel songs, and over the years, has dressed in Revolutionary War attire for Fourth of July celebrations.\n\nAkin and his wife lived for many years in his childhood home, a house owned by his father in affluent Town and Country, Missouri. When his father sought to subdivide the 8.5-acre property in the late 2000s, Akin moved to a house in Wildwood.\n\n"}
{"id": "1320240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1320240", "title": "Tom Dowd", "text": "Tom Dowd\n\nThomas John \"Tom\" Dowd (October 20, 1925 – October 27, 2002) was an American recording engineer and producer for Atlantic Records. He was credited with innovating the multitrack recording method. Dowd worked on a veritable \"who's who\" of recordings that encompassed blues, jazz, pop, rock and soul records.\n\nBorn in Manhattan, Dowd grew up playing piano, tuba, violin, and string bass. His mother was an opera singer and his father was a concertmaster.\n\nDowd graduated from Stuyvesant High School in June 1942 at the age of 16. He continued his musical education at City College of New York. Dowd also played in a band at New York's Columbia University, where he became a conductor. He was also employed at the physics laboratory of Columbia University.\n\nAt age 18, Dowd was drafted into the military with the rank of sergeant. He continued his work in physics at Columbia University. He worked on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. The purpose of the work was unclear until 1945. Dowd planned to obtain a degree in nuclear physics when he completed his work on the Manhattan Project. However, because his work was top secret, the university did not recognize it, and Dowd decided not to continue, since the university's curriculum would not have been able to further his physics education. His research for the military was more advanced than academic courses at that time.\n\nDowd took a job at a classical music recording studio until he obtained employment at Atlantic Records. His first hit was Eileen Barton's \"If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake\". He soon became a top recording engineer there and recorded popular artists such as Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, The Spinners, Ruth Brown and Bobby Darin, including Darin's famous rendition of Kurt Weill/Bertolt Brecht's \"Mack the Knife\". He captured jazz masterpieces by John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker. It was Dowd's idea to cut Ray Charles' recording of \"What'd I Say\" into two parts and release them as the A-side and B-side of the same single record.\n\nDowd worked as an engineer and producer from the 1940s until the beginning of the 21st century. While working for Atlantic Records, he lived in Westwood, NJ with his wife Jackie and his sons, Steven and Theodore. He recorded albums by many artists including Bee Gees, Eric Clapton, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Black Oak Arkansas, Derek and the Dominos, Rod Stewart, Wishbone Ash, New Model Army, Cream, Lulu, Chicago, the Allman Brothers Band, Joe Bonamassa, the J. Geils Band, Meat Loaf, Sonny & Cher, the Rascals, The Spinners, Willie Nelson, Diana Ross, Eagles, the Four Seasons, Kenny Loggins, James Gang, Dusty Springfield, Eddie Harris, Charles Mingus, Herbie Mann, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Joe Castro and Primal Scream. He was also an employee of Apex Studios in the 1950s. Dowd received a Grammy Trustees Award for his lifetime achievements in February 2002.\n\nHe died of emphysema on October 27, 2002, in Florida, where he had been living and working at Criteria Studios for many years, a week after his 77th birthday.\n\nTom Dowd helped to shape the artists that he worked with, and because he worked with an array of great artists on some of the world's greatest recordings, Dowd was highly influential in creating the sound of the second half of the 20th Century. It was he who encouraged Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records to install an Ampex eight-track recorder, enabling Atlantic to be the first recording company to record using multiple tracks.\n\nDowd is credited as the engineer who popularized the eight-track recording system for commercial music and popularized the use of stereophonic sound. He also pioneered the use of linear channel faders as opposed to rotary controls on audio mixers. He devised various methods for altering sound after the initial recording.\n\nIn 2003 director Mark Moormann premiered an award-winning documentary about his life entitled \"Tom Dowd and the Language of Music\". In the 2004 biopic \"Ray\", Tom Dowd was portrayed by actor Rick Gomez.\n\nTom Dowd was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. The ceremony took place on April 14, 2012, and Robbie Robertson gave the induction speech.\n\n"}
{"id": "19283170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19283170", "title": "Walter E. Williams", "text": "Walter E. Williams\n\nWalter Edward Williams (born March 31, 1936) is an American economist, commentator, and academic. He is the John M. Olin Distinguished Professor of Economics at George Mason University, as well as a syndicated columnist and author known for his classical liberal and libertarian conservative views. His writings frequently appear on Townhall.com, WND, and Jewish World Review.\n\nWilliams's family during childhood consisted of his mother, his sister, and him. Williams's father played no role in raising Williams or his sister. He grew up in Philadelphia. The family initially lived in West Philadelphia, moving to North Philadelphia and the Richard Allen housing projects when Williams was ten years old. His neighbors included a young Bill Cosby. Williams knew many of the individuals that Cosby speaks of from his childhood, including Weird Harold and Fat Albert.\n\nWilliams was a talented high school student who displayed a very inconsistent performance in his studies. Following high school, he went to California to live with his father and attend one semester at Los Angeles City College. He later said that he was not ready at that time to be a serious student. In 1959, he was drafted into the military, and served as a Private in the United States Army. While stationed in the South, he \"waged a one man battle against Jim Crow from inside the army\". He challenged the racial order with provocative statements to his fellow soldiers. This resulted in an overseeing officer filing a court-martial proceeding against Williams. Williams argued his own case and was found not guilty. While considering filing countercharges against the officer that had brought him up for court martial, Williams found himself transferred to Korea. Upon arriving there, Williams marked \"Caucasian\" for race on his personnel form. When challenged on this, Williams replied wryly if he had marked \"Black\", he would end up getting all the worst jobs. From Korea, Williams wrote a letter to President John F. Kennedy denouncing the pervasive racism in the American government and military and questioning the actions black Americans should take given the state of affairs, writing:\n\nHe received a reply from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Alfred B. Fitt, a response which he termed \"the most reasonable response that I received from any official.\"\n\nWilliams was described as follows by Richard W. Rahn in a December 20, 2010 \"Washington Times\" column:Friends who knew Mr. Williams long before I did have told me that he, by manner and dress, was viewed as a black radical during his earlier student days. He also freely confesses to having been a troublemaker when he was in the Army and elsewhere. But unlike others less wise, Mr. Williams grew to understand that he could do far more for both his black brothers and sisters and all other Americans by teaching them how free markets don't discriminate on the basis of race, religion or national origin, and hence lead to the greatest opportunity and prosperity for all.Following his military service, Williams re-entered college as a far more motivated student. Williams earned a bachelor's degree (1965) in Economics from California State College at Los Angeles (now California State University, Los Angeles). He earned both his master's degree (1967) and his Ph.D. (1972) in Economics from the University of California, Los Angeles. Speaking of his early college days, Williams says \"I was more than anything a radical. I was more sympathetic to Malcolm X than Martin Luther King because Malcolm X was more of a radical who was willing to confront discrimination in ways that I thought it should be confronted, including perhaps the use of violence. But I really just wanted to be left alone. I thought some laws, like minimum-wage laws, helped poor people and poor black people and protected workers from exploitation. I thought they were a good thing until I was pressed by professors to look at the evidence.\" While at UCLA, Williams came into contact with economists such as Armen Alchian, James M. Buchanan, and Axel Leijonhufvud who challenged his assumptions. Never one to be over-awed by others, Williams regularly challenged his professors as well. But on examining the evidence of actual outcomes, he came to believe such laws are abject failures. \"I learned that you have to evaluate the effects of public policy as opposed to intentions.\"\n\nWhile Williams was at UCLA, Thomas Sowell arrived on campus in 1969 as a visiting professor. Although he never took a class from Dr. Sowell, the two met and began a friendship that has lasted for decades. In the summer of 1972, Sowell was hired as director of the Urban Institute's Ethnic Minorities Project, which Williams joined shortly thereafter. Correspondence between Sowell and Williams appears in the 2007 \"A Man of Letters\" piece by Sowell.\n\nWilliams has been a professor of economics at George Mason University since 1980, and was chairman of the University's Economics department from 1995 to 2001.\n\nHe had previously been on the faculty of Los Angeles City College, California State University – Los Angeles, Temple University, and Grove City College. Williams was awarded an honorary degree at Universidad Francisco Marroquin.\n\nWilliams has written ten books and hundreds of articles. His syndicated column is published weekly in approximately 140 newspapers across the United States, as well as on several web sites by Creators Syndicate. He also wrote and hosted documentaries for PBS in 1985. The \"Good Intentions\" documentary was based on his book \"The State Against Blacks\". In July 2017, the Drudge Report dropped the link to Walter E. Williams' weekly column. No reason was known for the exclusion. However, the link was reinstated in August 2017.\n\nAs an economist, Williams is a proponent of free market economics and opposes socialist systems of government intervention. Williams believes laissez-faire capitalism is the most moral, most productive system humans have ever devised.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1970s, Williams conducted research into the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 and on the impact of minimum wage laws on minority employment. His research led him to conclude the government's interventional programs are harmful. Among those state programs Williams was critical of were minimum wage and affirmative action laws, stating both practices inhibit liberty and are detrimental to the blacks they are intended to help. He published his results in his 1982 book \"The State Against Blacks\", where he argued that laws regulating economic activity are far greater obstacles to economic progress for blacks than racial bigotry and discrimination. Subsequently, Williams has spoken on the topic and penned a number of articles detailing his view that increases in the minimum wage price low skill workers out of the market, eliminating their opportunities for employment. Williams believes that racism and the legacy of slavery in the United States are overemphasized as problems faced by the black community today. He points to the crippling effects of a welfare state and the disintegration of the black family as more pressing concerns. \"The welfare state has done to black Americans what slavery couldn't do, and that is to destroy the black family.\" Although in favor of equal access to government institutions such as court houses, city halls, and libraries, Williams opposes anti-discrimination laws directed at the private sector on the grounds that such laws infringe upon the people's right of freedom of association.\n\nWilliams views gun control laws as a governmental infringement upon the rights of individuals, and argues that they end up endangering the innocent while failing to reduce crime. Williams also makes the argument that the true proof of whether or not an individual owns something is whether or not they have the right to sell it. Taking this argument to its conclusion, he supports legalization of selling one's own bodily organs. He argues that government prohibiting the selling of one's bodily organs is an infringement upon one's property rights, asking \"If I don't own my organs, please tell me who does?\"\n\nRegarding federalism, Williams is in favor of power being in the hands of the states, with limited powers being held by the Federal government. He notes this was the design of the nation's founding documents, which were largely undermined by the events of the Civil War:\n\nIn light of the founding documents, Williams concludes it is the right of U.S. states to secede from the union if they so wish, as several states attempted to do during the Civil War. He has gone on record as advocating the Free State Project in at least two columns and once on television. The Williams endorsement correlated with the largest single membership jump in the first 5000 phase of the project, a jump even higher than the results of the project being slashdotted.\n\nWilliams believes programs such as affirmative action and minimum wage laws set up to aid minorities have, in fact, been harmful to them and stifled their ability to advance in society. \"Affirmative action has led to, I believe, many Black people expecting favors from the system and not working as hard as they otherwise would. That is, if you know that you can get into college because of affirmative action—or some people call it diversity nowadays—well then why work as hard in high school? So it might undermine some of the spirit of people. And I think that the basic premise of those who advocate affirmative action is that the problems that Black Americans face today are the result of racial discrimination.\" In reaction to what he viewed as inappropriate racial sensitivity that he saw hurting blacks in higher education, Williams began in the 1970s to offer colleagues a \"certificate of amnesty and pardon\" to all white people for Western Civilization's sins against blacks – and \"thus obliged them not to act like damn fools in their relationships with Americans of African ancestry.\" He still offers it to anyone. The certificate can be obtained at his website.\n\nWilliams is opposed to the Federal Reserve System. He has also compared U.S. monetary policy to \"counterfeiting\": \"Knowing the dangers posed by central banks, we might ask whether our country needs the Federal Reserve Bank. Whenever I'm told that we need this or that government program, I always ask what we did before. It turns out that we did without a central bank from 1836, when President Andrew Jackson closed the Second Bank of the United States, to 1913 when Federal Reserve Act was written. During that interval, we prospered and became one of the world's major economic powers.\"\n\nIn his work, Williams builds on the economic theories of F. A. Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Henry Hazlitt, and Milton Friedman, as well as the previously mentioned Thomas Sowell, and he has said of Ayn Rand's 1967 work \"Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal\" that it is \"one of the best defenses and explanations of capitalism one is likely to read.\"\n\nBesides his weekly columns, Williams has become known nationally as a highly popular guest host before the twenty million listeners of the Rush Limbaugh radio program when Limbaugh is away traveling. \"Reason\" has called Williams \"one of the country's leading libertarian voices.\" In 2009, Greg Ransom, a writer for the Ludwig von Mises Institute, ranked Williams as the third-most important \"Hayekian\" Public Intellectual in America, behind only Thomas Sowell and John Stossel.\n\nWilliams and his wife Connie (née Taylor) were married from 1960 until her death on December 29, 2007. They had one daughter, Devon. Williams is a cousin of former NBA player Julius Erving.\n\nWilliams served on the board of directors of Media General from 2001 until his retirement from the board in 2011. He was also chairman of the Audit Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
