He is author of 4 novels and author of National-Radio documentaries and features about music since more than 25 years and works as a visual artist. \nAl Gromer Khan was awarded the RABINDRANATH TAGORE CULTURAL PRIZE 2015 for his lifetime achievement as musician/performer on sitar and surbahar of the highest order, composer, writer and visual artist by the Indo-German Society.\n\nAl Gromer Khan was born on April 8, 1946, at Frauenzell in the alpine foothills of Bavaria between Lake Constance and Munich.\n\nDuring his college time he founded a skiffle-group became a jazzguitarist and left his home to become a jazz musician and a beat poet, spending time in London, Tangier and India.\n\nGromer Khan claims that he was drawn to the \"mysteries of sound\", from early childhood, be it the sound of the bells worn by the Bavarian cows grazing in the alpine meadows near his birthplace, or the \"singing\" telephone wires on the wind in the freezing Bavarian winters, and later American blues and country music, Indian stringed instruments, the drums of North Africa. Gromer Khan claims to have rejected the academic or diplomatic careers his parents expected him to take up.\n\nThe 1960s found a twenty-something Al Gromer in London where he took part in a number of creative experiments which were to have a lasting influence on him. According to Gromer Khan, the Prince Tiane na Champassak of Laos introduced him to tantric art and pop star Marc Bolan invited him to join in the all-night jam sessions he hosted. He explored psycho-acoustic phenomena with film director Mike Figgis, and saxophonist Ronnie Scott of Ronnie Scott's Jazzclub, who introduced Al to Ben Webster, Max Roach and Miles Davis, while Cat Stevens (now known as Yusuf Islam), gave him a taste for English poetry. At times he attended a London art school.\n\nThere is no doubt that Gromer Khan's creative encounters during the 1960s deeply formed his musical taste and style; however, Gromer’s ultimate musical awakening came at a recital by sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan in Westminster Abbey 1968. Gromer Khan professes to have been so moved by the performance that he instantly decided to devote his life to the study of the sitar. He went to India, where he was to find a powerful teacher in Vilayat Khan's brother, Ustad Imrat Khan. Gromer Khan remained in India for the next three years, speed-learning his instrument at the feet of his guru. He returned to Bavaria in 1973, already an accomplished sitarist.\n\nGromer Khan spent the next 7 years studying with Imrat Khan in Europe and India. In 1975, his teacher performed the Ghanda Ceremony, thus initiating Al Gromer into the Khan-I-Gharana lineage of sitarists. He was the first outsider to be accepted into this particular Gharana, which like most Hindustani musical traditions, passes knowledge down the generations from father to son. After his initiation, Al Gromer added \"Khan\" to his name.\n\nConcurrently, Khan engaged in a number of experimental projects, pioneering the proto-electronic music amongst others together with Popol Vuh. He was involved in contemplative and world music for radio, television, film and sound recordings projects. With his extensive compositional work he was the initiator and key figure of musical genres that are now known as Ambient and World Music, New Age.\n\nTravel and concerts of classical Indian music in India and Europe followed. In addition, texts and documentaries on music for various ARD radio stations.\nSince 1974, Khan has released more than 50 albums.\n\nHe currently resides in Munich, Germany.\n\nIn 2006 the novel Der Lehrer sein Schüler und der weiße Mogul audiobook was released. 2007 the short novel Jazzweihnacht audiobook followed. 2011 the English version e-book Jazzchristmas. 2009 the novels Jimi of Silence and Der weiße Mogul were released. 2013 the English version The White Mogul and e-book 2015.

He was born in February 1106 at Balabista in Macedonia, was made co-emperor with his father at 16 or 17 years of age and died on 2 August 1142 at Attalia, Pamphylia. He was an elder brother of the emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and had a twin sister, Maria Komnene (plus other siblings).\n\nAlexios was made co-emperor by his father in 1122, but died in 1142. This was the year before his father's death as the result of a hunting accident. The reign of John II is less well chronicled than those of his father, Alexios I, or successor, Manuel I, and coverage of the life of his son Alexios is very sparse.\n\nA panegyrical poem by Theodore Prodromos was addressed to John and his son on the occasion of the coronation of Alexios. It hailed both rulers as \"kings born of kings and emperors, reformers of old customs and privileges, with whom the august throne and sceptre-bearing are a paternal acquisition, a matter of inheritance.\"\n\nHis final illness is described: \"...of the severest kind and of short duration, took the form of a rushing fever attacking the head as though it were an acropolis.\" The location of Alexios' death, at Attalia, suggests that he was on campaign with his father, who had established this city as a base from which to pacify the inland areas around Lake Pousgousē (probably the modern Beyşehir Gölü). Alexios' younger brother Andronikos was charged with escorting the body back to Constantinople, however, while discharging this duty, he too was taken ill and died.\n\nThe identity of his wife is uncertain. It is possible he was married twice, the first wife being Dobrodjeja Mstislavna of Kiev, a daughter of Mstislav I of Kiev, and the second being Kata of Georgia, a daughter of David IV of Georgia. While both women are known to have married members of the Komnenoi family, several theories have been suggested as to the identities of their husband or husbands.\n\nHis daughter Maria Komnene married the \"pansebastos\" Alexios Axuch. He was the son of John Axuch, the \"megas domestikos\" (commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army), who was a close friend of John II. Alexios Axuch served as Duke of Cilicia and \"protostrator\". However he eventually fell out of favor with Manuel I Komnenos in 1167. John Kinnamos and Niketas Choniates report that the accusations against him included practice of witchcraft. He and an unnamed \"Latin\" wizard were accused of causing the pregnancy of Maria of Antioch, the Empress consort, to result in a miscarriage. They supposedly managed to do so by providing drugs to Maria. Alexios ended his life as a monk. Maria Komnene, \"wife of Alexios the \"protostrator\"\" was mentioned in a seal. According to the \"Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople\" (1983) by Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, this Maria was suffering from insanity by the end of her life.\n\nThey were the parents of John Komnenos \"the Fat\", a short-lived rival emperor to Alexios III Angelos. Theodora Axuchina, wife of Alexios I of Trebizond, is considered a possible daughter of John the Fat.\n\n"}

He won the gold medal in the 110 metre hurdles at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, he moved to Marietta, Georgia at a young age, attending Joseph Wheeler High School, where he was teammates with Reggie Witherspoon. Merritt ran for the University of Tennessee from 2003 to 2006 and had a successful college career, a seven-time All-American. He took the 110 meter hurdles gold at the 2004 World Junior Championships and finished sixth at the 2006 World Athletics Final. Also in 2006, he won the NCAA Championships, was undefeated in all hurdles events that year, and broke Willie Gault's Tennessee Volunteers hurdles record. His victory at the NCAA Championships in 13.21 s was the second fastest ever collegiate time in the United States, behind only Renaldo Nehemiah. He reached the World Athletics Final in 2008, finishing in fourth.\nMerritt is the first hurdler to ever win gold in the US Indoor Championship, the World Indoor Championship (Istanbul, Turkey), the US Olympic Trials, and the Olympic Games all in the same year.\n\nIn the final of the 110m hurdles at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, Merritt was initially classified 6th, with a time of 13.67 s. After Dayron Robles was disqualified, Merritt was promoted to 5th. His season's best was 13.12 s, achieved in Eugene, Oregon and Oslo.\n\nMerritt began the 2012 campaign by altering his approach to the first hurdle, switching from eight to seven steps. In an interview he stated, \"[it] was pretty risky to make a change like that, but something had to be done if I was going to compete with (Liu Xiang of China and Dayron Robles of Cuba). The change allows me to maintain my momentum going into the first barrier.\" Merrit's change was highly successful for the 2012 indoor season as he became the indoor world champion in the 60 meters hurdles at the 2012 World Indoor Championships in Istanbul. In the final, he beat Liu Xiang and Pascal Martinot-Lagarde with a time of 7.44 s.\n\nAt the Olympic trials in Oregon, Merritt won the 110 meter hurdles final in a world leading time of 12.93 s, making the Olympic team for the first time. Merritt subsequently matched the time at two consecutive Diamond League events, at Crystal Palace and Monaco, winning both races.\n\nAt the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Merritt began by running the fastest qualifying time in the heats with a time of 13.07 s. In the semi-finals, he was again dominant with a time of 12.94 s. In the final, Dayron Robles and Merritt got the fastest starts but Merritt pulled ahead at hurdle 3. He continued to a personal best of 12.92 s and a 0.12 s win over reigning world champion Jason Richardson.\n\nOn September 7, 2012, at the final Diamond League meet (Memorial Van Damme) in Brussels, Belgium, Merritt ran a time of 12.80 s in the 110 meter hurdles, shattering the old world record of 12.87 s held by Dayron Robles. Merritt's performance was the largest drop in the world record for 110 meter hurdles (0.07 s) since Nehemiah in 1981. Merrit ran consistently throughout the 2012 season. The following are his times that lead-up to his world record performance in the 110 meter hurdles:\n\nMerritt finished 6th in 2013 World Championships in Athletics – Men's 110 metres hurdles.

After several months of medical treatment, he was eventually able to return to competition on the following year, albeit far from his previous registers.\n\nMerrit's recovery from his kidney problems was enough to allow him to finish third in the USATF Outdoor Championships in June, obtaining a place for the World Championship.

Mouton\n\nAshton Joseph Mouton, Sr. (October 16, 1916 – January 31, 1988), was a United States businessman and politician who became, at thirty-one, the youngest mayor in the history of Lafayette, Louisiana. A Democrat, Mouton was elected mayor in 1948. He served two four-year terms and left office in 1956. In 1963, Mouton was an unsuccessful contender for lieutenant governor on an intraparty ticket with the winning gubernatorial candidate, John Julian McKeithen of tiny Columbia, the seat of Caldwell Parish, in northeastern Louisiana.\n\nMouton was born in Lafayette (also Lafayette Parish) to Edwin Mouton, Sr., and the former Georgie McBride. He was educated at Mount Carmel Elementary School and Cathedral High School in Lafayette. In 1939, he obtained a degree in business administration from Southwestern Louisiana Institute, now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He married the former Stella Rose Dupuis, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. J.W. Dupuis, Sr., of Youngsville in Lafayette Parish. They had five children: Stella Rose; Ashton J. Mouton, Jr. (born 1947); twins Catherine Anne and Carolyn Anne (born 1953); and John Mouton. The twins were the first pygopagus conjoined twins to be successfully separated. There is also a namesake grandson, Ashton J. Mouton, III, of Lafayette (born 1983).\n\nFrom 1939-1941, Mouton was the administrative assistant in the Lafayette municipal finance office. He served in the United States Army during World War II from 1941 to 1945. After the war, Mouton started a career in life insurance.\n\nMouton succeeded Claude C. Colomb (July 19, 1889 - December 1973) as mayor. He was recognized widely for his mayoral success, even being honored on March 10, 1955, by the Louisiana Municipal Association and its trade publication, the \"Louisiana Municipal Review\", as one of the outstanding mayors in Louisiana at the time. Over the next several decades, Lafayette became the fourth largest city in the state. At the time of Mouton's service, Lafayette, as did many other Louisiana communities, had a commission form of city government. He was succeeded as mayor by Jerome E. Domengeaux (March 3, 1919 - May 27, 1999).\n\nAfter his mayoral years, Mouton became an independent oil and natural gas lease broker. He held various state-level appointments too, including the Mineral Board (1950–1952), Board of Tax Appeals (1956–1958), commissioner of conservation (1958–1960, collector of revenues, (1964–1970), director of hospitals (1970–1971), and administrative assistant to the director of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement in 1972. The three former appointments were in the administration of Governor Earl Kemp Long, and the three later positions were under his mentor John McKeithen. Mouton was affiliated with the powerful Long faction of Louisiana politics.\n\nIn 1965, Mouton sued the Schwegmann Brothers Giant Super Markets, Inc., to collect for the state sales, use and occupational license taxes plus interest in the amount of $62,517.98. Schwegmann appealed the assessments to the Louisiana Board of Tax Appeals. Ten years later, the tax board ruled in Mouton's favor, some five years after he had left the collector's position. The former super market was owned in part by then state Representative John G. Schwegmann of Jefferson Parish. Thereafter, Mouton sued to collect another $103,290.59. Schwegmann answered and denied liability. The two cases were consolidated in the trial court by consent of the parties. In the trial, Mouton was upheld in both cases. In 1971, Schwegmann unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor on a platform to cut government spending.\n\nMouton began selling real estate in 1976 and was associated with an agency in Lafayette from 1978 until his death ten years later.\n\nIn his lieutenant governor's race, Mouton failed to make the Democratic runoff primary, which was won by the incumbent Clarence C. \"Taddy\" Aycock of Franklin, the seat of St. Mary Parish. Aycock defeated future state Senator Claude B. Duval of Houma in Terrebonne Parish. Also running on the McKeithen-Mouton ticket for the new position of insurance commissioner was future U.S. Representative and then State Senator Speedy O. Long (1928–2006) of Jena, the seat of La Salle Parish. Long was defeated by Dudley A.

The Grossman Burn Foundation in California pledged to perform reconstructive surgery and began organizing for her visa in the early spring of 2010. Diane Sawyer of ABC News originally covered her ordeal in March 2010 and revisited her story again in 2014.\n\nAisha suffered early in life, losing her mother and forced into marriage as a teenager. In a practice known as baad, Aisha's father promised her to a Taliban fighter when she was 12 years old as compensation for a killing that a member of her family had committed. She was married at 14 and subjected to abuse. At 18 she fled the abuse but was caught by police, jailed for five months, and returned to her family. Her father returned her to her husband's family. To take revenge on her escape, her father-in-law, husband, and three other family members took Aisha into the mountains, cut off her nose and her ears, and left her to die. Aisha was later rescued by aid workers and the U.S. military. Some sources disputed the role of any members of the Taliban in her mutilation.\n\nAisha was featured on the August 2010 cover of \"Time\" magazine, and in the corresponding article, \"Afghan Women and the Return of the Taliban.\" The cover image generated enormous controversy. The image and the accompanying cover title, \"What Happens if We Leave Afghanistan,\" fueled debate about the merits of the Afghan War.\n\nThe photo was taken by the South African photographer Jodi Bieber and was awarded the World Press Photo Award for 2010. The image of Aisha is sometimes compared to the \"Afghan Girl\" photograph of Sharbat Gula taken by Steve McCurry.\n\nShortly after \"Time\"'s cover ran in August 2010, Aisha was flown to the United States to receive free reconstructive surgery. After arriving in California, she psychologically regressed into performing fake seizures, tantrums, and self-harm that required hospitalization. Surgeons concluded that she was not \"emotionally prepared\" to handle the patient responsibilities in the reconstructive surgery process, and her psychologist diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder. While her reconstructive surgery was delayed, she was taken in by the Women for Afghan Women shelter in Queens, New York, but she caused many problems for the staff and other residents, including roommates hired by the shelter to live with her. Aisha's condition improved with a change in medications, and the seizures stopped.\n\nLater, Aisha's psychological condition improved enough that she was able to cease taking medications to control her behavior. Starting in 2012, preparations to do a multistage facial reconstruction for Aisha began. Her forehead was expanded over the course of several months to provide enough tissue to build a new nose. The structure for her new nose was built using cartilage from her own body and tissue from her left hand was also used for the inner lining. Aisha underwent a total of 12 completed surgeries.\n\nIn 2014 ABC News revisited Aisha and revealed her new nose that has altered her appearance. Aisha has been adopted by an Afghan-American couple, and lives in Maryland. She studies English and mathematics and aspires to be a police officer.\n\n"}

However, Bourguiba and his friends founded their own newspaper, despite the colonial attempts to stop them. \"L'Action Tunisienne\" was thus created in order to defend the \"little people\" in a context of economic crisis, following the Great Depression.\n\nBourguiba, worried about his country's state, knew that a good cause would revive the national movement, weakened by the 1926 repressions. In order to do so, he was the only one to defend M'hamed Chenik, a Tunis notable, who had been in trouble with the Residence, the French colonial administration. Bourguiba jumped at the chance to rally the bourgeoisie class to the nationalist cause. But his attempt failed and ended up dividing \"L'Action\" team. In this context, the uprising following the Tunisian naturalization issue, in early 1933, was the perfect opportunity for him. He started another successful press campaign. With his friends Tahar Sfar, Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga and his brother M'hamed, they sensitized lower classes to their cause and changed the Residence policy. The popularity he acquired during the event, led to his election as a member of the executive committee of the Destour, in May 1933. However, differences with the elders caused him to resign from the party in September 1933.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Bourguiba joined the Destour party, then the major political organization of the Tunisian national movement. He rose to its leadership along with Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga, Tahar Sfar and his brother M'hamed. As preparations took place to host French President Paul Doumer as part of the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the protectorate, nationalists were not pleased. In an article he wrote in \"Le Croissant\", a newspaper managed by his cousin Abdelaziz El-Aroui, Bourguiba denounced the festivities as a \"humiliating affront to the dignity of the Tunisian people to whom France recalls the loss of freedom and independence\".\n\nFollowing these events, the Destour leadership gathered in an emergency meeting at the Hôtel d'Orient in February 1931. It was decided to constitute a supporting committee for Chedly Khairallah's weekly newspaper, \"La Voix du Tunisien\", which became a daily. The young nationalists joined the team and wrote critical analyses of the protectorate. Bourguiba, unlike his elders, dared to challenge the protectorate, publishing numerous articles and defining his own views on the colonial administration. He questioned both its effects and existence, writing: \n\n\"La Voix du Tunisien\" became a very popular newspaper because of the originality with which Bourguiba, Sfar, Guiga and Materi addressed problems. They stood out from their Destour elders by their new ways of thinking. Bourguiba reckoned the end of the protectorate as the outcome of an evolution that had taken its roots in the very principles of French civilization, unlike Abdelaziz Thâalbi, who thought of it as a breakup, in an article he wrote in \"La Tunisie martyre\". Referred to as the \"four musketeers\", they were in favor of the intangibility of national personality and political sovereignty of the Tunisian people with a progressive emancipation of the country, while advocating for a nationalism that struggled against a regime and not a civilization.\n\nTheir work soon attracted the interest of both public opinion and wealthy landowners and businessmen (preponderants) who had a strong influence on the colonial administration. Hostile to their daring plea, the preponderants wrote in \"La Tunisie française\": \"Mr Bourguiba proposes to transform the Destourian lament into a doctoral thesis in law. The claims are not modest [...] They must be demanded to tone down their \"Voix du Tunisien\"\". During the conference he held in November 1973, Bourguiba related the events of his beginnings in journalism and the success of his articles: \n\nThe preponderants were successful in their attempts to silence the nationalist papers as the colonial administration censored \"An-Nahdha\", the daily paper of the reformist party and the weekly \"Ez-Zohra\", on May 12, 1931. Within days, Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Bahri Guiga, Salah Farhat and Mahmoud El Materi were sued. Chedli Khalledi, a member of the Destour party, alerted Marius Moutet and Gaston Bergery, chief of staff to Édouard Herriot, who were friends of the nationalists and had influence in Paris. Bergery quickly interfered, contacted the head of the African-Orient department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and obtained an adjournment of their hearings to June 9, 1931. Awaiting trial, the editors of \"La Voix du Tunisien\" launched a press protest campaign whose tone was both violent and revolutionary. El Materi wrote: \"When we started political action, we knew in advance what was awaiting us [...] May the hand that strikes me be heavy, may the judges that charge me be ruthless [...] A cause that does not engender martyrs is lost in advance.\"\n\nOn the day of trial, the streets that led to the court were full of people. Shops and stores of the medina quarter were closed and law enforcement could not handle the turmoil. The crowd carried them in triumph as their hearings were, once again, postponed. Fearing overthrow, François Manceron, then-resident-general, met with Chedly Khairallah, manager of \"La Voix du Tunisien\", at his residence in La Marsa, to find a compromise. That very afternoon, he invited the drafting committee of the newspaper and declared that he had an interview, that morning, with Khairallah. He also announced that a compromise was found. This lie made mischief within the group. Bourguiba asked Khairallah for further clarifications and he confirmed the rendezvous with the resident-general. In response the drafting committee demanded the management of the daily journal but, upon Khairallah's refusal to do so, decided to leave the newspaper.\n\nAfter they left the newspaper, the \"La Voix du Tunisien\" team kept in touch and gathered sometimes in the Café de la Kasbah or the Baghdad restaurant to discuss news and ideas, along with French and Tunisian socialist friends, such as the pharmacist Ali Bouhageb. During these meetings, the idea of creating a new newspaper was considered as they missed expressing their ideas. A drafting committee was formed that included Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Bahri Guiga, Tahar Sfar, Mahmoud El Materi and Ali Bouhageb, who also managed the publishing firm. Béchir Mehedhbi, a final year student, took charge of the editorial office. As for the newspaper headquarters, they were settled in the back of the Bouhageb pharmacy.\n\nIn the midst of an economic crisis that mainly affected lower classes, \"L'Action Tunisienne\" published its first edition on November 1, 1932. Bourguiba, who studied public finance during his university studies of political science in Paris, devoted his first article to the budget, which he called the \"Tunisian budget\". He explained his idea writing: \"I used to demonstrate that budget reflected the policy of the government and that it permitted to believe that the country was thrown into abyss.\"\n\nDisappointed in the resigned moderation of their elders, the young nationalists defended lower classes. Bouhajeb devoted an entire section of the newspaper for this purpose, which he called \"La Voix du guenillard\", while the other members of the drafting committee wrote in turn in their editorials. Fed information through documents provided by administration officials, they soon became famous among the public. Bourguiba, who was increasingly known for his work, socialized with Tunisois notables and went frequently to intellectual discussion circles where he met the Boulakbeche family. He proved himself to be clear and specific in his writings, which revealed a \"talented polemist\" with his strong legal arguments. He was committed to demonstrate the mechanism of colonial abuse from the effects to the causes, showing a great interest in social phenomenon, inviting workers and students to organize in order to defended themselves against abuse. He also insisted on the defence and safeguard of the Tunisian personality, writing: \n\nIn February 1933, a major fight within \"L'Action Tunisienne\" turned into a crisis, following the case of M'hamed Chenik, banker and chairman of the Tunisian Credit Union, which dominated the medina. In 1932, Chenik went to Paris as the vice-president of the Tunisian representatives of the Great Council, in order to alert the French government about the problems of indigenous agriculture. France decided to designate a committee chaired by Louis Tardy, manager of the National Agricultural Credit Fund, to investigate the situation in Tunisia. This move did not please the Residence which denounced the \"convicted diligence\" of Chenik. The colonial administration thus decided to seal his bank accounts. Despite this, there was no reaction in public opinion or among nationalists, even though the Tunisian members of the Great Council were collaborating with the protectorate. Only Bourguiba disapproved of the reaction of his friends, that he qualified as primary, writing: \"I had there a first-hand witness who would give me weapons against the Protectorate and means to strengthen my position towards this regime. It was me who was winning in such a process. I did not care that some personalities improve their image at the same time.\"\n\nEven though some people argued that Bourguiba acted out of personal interest, (he and his brother were tied to the bank by a loan), his aims were mainly related to reviving Tunisian nationalism. Chenik stated in an interview that any collaboration with France became impossible. Bourguiba saw in this case a victory that could rally the bourgeois class, considered to be collaborating with France, and unify the country around nationalism. He wrote: \"We need to focus our attention on the event that had happened, on the argument which had been offered, so that we could widen our movement to important social classes of the nation, once indifferent or hostile to our program\".\n\nTo achieve his goal, he used \"non-orthodox approaches\". He went to \"L'Action\" headquarters to remove a critical part of his brother M'hamed, written in an article by Ali Bouhajeb, whom he did not inform. Bourguiba testified about his act in 1973 saying: \n\nSupported by Guiga and M'hedhbi, Bouhajeb judged Bourguiba's attitude and that of the journal in this case to be \"unacceptable\" before the three handed over their resignations. One of them later testified that: \"Curiously, this excited Bourguiba. He was crushed because Bouhajeb and Mehedbi took care of all the material details, but he was a man of challenge.\" Bourguiba then abandoned his lawyer's office and decided to manage the newspaper on his own.\n\nWhile the Great Council gathered to adjudicate on the agricultural budget, inspired by the recommendation of the Tardi committee, Bourguiba sent out a \"supreme warning\", writing: \"We will be particularly inexorable against the last-minute setbacks or interested jilting.\" His arrogance with the protectorate, and his determination to stand up to Chenik, was found to be impressive. When the draft budget favorable to French interests against which Chenik pronounced an indictment was rejected by the Great Council, Bourguiba wrote that: \"The Tunisian people will remember that the delegates of the Jewish community were interested in the fate of our fellahs (farmers) much more than certain Muslim agricultural delegates of Center and South. The Tunisia we intend to free will not be a Tunisia for Muslims, for Jewish or for Christians. It will be the Tunisia of all those who, without distinction of religion or race, would like to accredit for their country and live under the protection of equal laws.\" This statement will gradually become his doctrine, both modernist and secular.\n\nWith the economic crisis that worsened day after day, and the rising popularity acquired by Bourguiba and his friends, a new generation of nationalist leaders emerged. Preoccupied, they reckoned a good cause would be sufficient to revive the national movement on a new basis. In this context, the Tunisian naturalization issue presented itself as a motive for the movement's renewal. During the 1920s, the nationalists protested in force against the enactment of the December 20, 1923, law which favored access by non-French protectorate inhabitants to French citizenship. According to the colonial power, they had, at the time, to face the increase judged to be \"too fast\" of the Italian colony compared to insufficient metropolitan immigration.\n\nThe hostility following the adoption of these measures receded gradually but resumed in the start of 1933. On December 31, 1932, upon the announcement of the death of a naturalized French Muslim living in Bizerte, Mohamed Chaabane, individuals gathered in the Muslim cemetery with the firm will to oppose the interment of the dead. They obtained the support of the city's mufti who delivered a fatwa affirming that as apostates naturalized can not be buried in Muslim cemeteries.\n\nBourguiba decided to react and started a press campaign, led by \"L'Action Tunisienne\" and partially reprised by all the nationalist newspapers: \"We then embarked on a major campaign to combat this thesis \"[naturalization]\" whose any consequence was to inevitably lead to francisation all the Tunisian people. Citing a verse of the Qur'an, we developed the argument that, by ceasing to be amenable to the Sharaa Court, the naturalized French ipso facto lost his Muslim attributes\", he declared in 1973. Italy, fearing a major naturalization of its citizens, brought a discreet but active support to Bourguiba, decided to discredit the French initiatives and build a reputation.\n\nIn order to stop the turmoil that worsened in the country every time a naturalized died, the Residence demanded a fatwa, in April, from the Sharaa Court of Tunis, the highest religious body of the protectorate. The Maliki and Hanafi sheikhs in charge of the case issued a sentence that solves nothing: They maintained the apostate status of a naturalized but said that if he repented, even verbally, before his death, burial in Muslim lands will be granted. This decision angered the nationalists while riots started in Kairouan and Tunis. Bourguiba denounced the duplicity of religious authorities, the provocations of the government, cast aspersions on naturalized and criticized the Destourian press whose \"caution considered as the ultimate strategy seems overwhelmed\". He invited the French people and Ahmad II Bey to intervene. Meanwhile, the Residence took a two-phased decision: Firstly, it yielded deciding that naturalized will be buried in special burial place, which appeared to be ghettos excluding them from the community. And secondly, François Manceron, resident-general at the time, enacted decrees judged \"super-scoundrel\" by Joachim Durel, granting him authority to imprison and arrest, at his will, any nationalist, also giving him the authority to suspend any newspaper or association \"hostile to the Protectorate\". Bourguiba commented this decision writing: \"Repression comes too late. The atavistic fatalism of an oppressed people was shaken\".\n\nBourguiba's firm position increased his popularity among nationalists as he testified in 1973 saying: \n\nThis victory led activists to request the convening of an extraordinary Destour. The event was held on May 12 and May 13, 1933, in Tunis at Mountain Street. Bourguiba made a speech criticizing the \"outdated futile methods and the illusions of the leaders and their program that does not meet the aspirations of the people, who are therefore aware of his case\". He also asked for \"radical solutions, a tireless and energetic action unequivocally unnecessary or exclusively harmful to achieve independence within a union treaty with France, guaranteeing its legitimate interests and the interests of all the foreign colony.\" He noted that: \"In order to do so, we must form a front to unite all the trends of the great Tunisian Constitutional Liberal Party.\" Successful in their press campaign, all of the \"L'Action Tunisienne\" team were elected unanimously as members of the executive committee of the Destour.\n\nAt the time, Bourguiba and his friends of \"L'Action Tunisienne\" saw the Destour as lacking firmness. Nevertheless, it developed an organization with 90 local representatives from throughout the country. It had not grown since the arrival of Manceron at the head of the Residence. Recruiting among lower classes as well as the bourgeois classes, the new distinction among the Destour permitted them to have a strong position and influence the party in order to unify all factions of the nationalist front. Responding to the wishes of Bourguiba, many delegates supported this union. However, in 1933, it was not yet Bourguiba but Mahmoud El Materi who appeared to be the leader of \"L'Action\" group. This man who proved himself to be an active man of science in the French communist party and ended up as a delegate during the Tours Congress. He expressed his will not to become a politician. As far as he was concerned, tolerance, the sense of honour, solidarity, spirit, and justice overrode tactics, cynicism, provocation, and low blows. His qualities and charisma allowed him to forge a strong position within the Destour in which he was unanimous.\n\nMeanwhile, the turmoil over the naturalization issue continued in Tunis with riots that started in the countryside, affected by famine. The nationalist press thus multiplied its criticism towards the Residence, which had decided to prohibit teachers and students from attending certain lessons. It also forbade the movement of officials and suspended nationalist newspapers, including \"L'Action Tunisienne\" on May 31. In addition, the Destour party was banned. The French government feeling that Manceron acted too late to stand firm, replaced him with Marcel Peyrouton, on July 29, 1933. In this repressive context, Bourguiba was deprived of his means of expression and was a prisoner of the Destour structure that was willing to take back his autonomy.\n\nOn August 8, the opportunity to express himself was presented when incidents began in Monastir upon the forced interment in a Muslim cemetery of the son of a naturalized citizen. A fight erupted between the population and law enforcement, ending with one person dead and numerous injured. Bourguiba soon convinced Monastirian notables who were victims of police brutality, to choose him as their lawyer. On September 4, without informing the Destour of his initiative, Bourguiba led a protest delegation to the bey. They were welcomed by a man of confidence, who listened to their requests. Nevertheless, the party leadership, seeing in this the pretext to put a stop to activism that displeased them, decided to blame to the young nationalist: \"It was he [Mahmoud El Materi] who announced me that a blame motion had been decided against me. I was outraged. Because my procedures at the head of this delegation protesting to the bey was not on the party's behalf, but on the behalf of a lawyer who intervened to defend his clients, all originating in Monastir, my birth city. Therefore, nothing justified this blame motion. My membership in the executive committee of the Destour should not prohibit me from other activity. Should it be so, there was no option left for me but to resign. Materi and the other members of \"L'Action Tunisienne\" wanted to do the same. But I dissuaded them, their presence in the executive committee could have been useful\", he recalled years later.\n\nBourguiba, who thought the Destour and its leadership to be obstacles to his ambitions, decided to resign from the party on September 9. He soon learned from this experience. The success obtained thanks to popular violent uprisings shows the failure of Destourians' favorite methods, consisting of petitions and telegrams. Only violence by determined groups could lead the Residence to step back and negotiate political solutions. That would be his guideline until 1956.\n"}

{"id": "1068789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1068789", "title": "Frank Nitti", "text": "Frank Nitti\n\nFrancesco Raffaele Nitto (January 27, 1886 – March 19, 1943), commonly known as Frank Nitti, and nicknamed \"The Enforcer\", was an Italian-American gangster. One of Al Capone's top henchmen, Nitti was in charge of all money flowing through the operation. Nitti later succeeded Capone as boss of the Chicago Outfit.\n\nFrancesco Raffaele Nitto was born in the small town of Angri, province of Salerno, Campania, Italy. He was the second child of Luigi and Rosina (Fezza) Nitto and a first cousin of Al Capone. His father died in 1888, when Frank was two years old, and within a year his mother married Francesco Dolendo. Although two children were born to the couple, neither survived—leaving Francesco and his older sister, Giovannina, the only children. Francesco Dolendo emigrated to the United States in July 1890, and the rest of the family followed in June 1893 when Nitti was seven. The family settled at 113 Navy Street, Brooklyn, New York City. Little Francesco attended public school and worked odd jobs after school to support the family. His 15-year-old sister married a 24-year-old man, and his mother gave birth to his half-brother Raphael, in 1894, and another child, Gennaro, in 1896. He quit school after the seventh grade, and worked as a pinsetter, factory worker, and barber. Al Capone's family lived nearby, and Nitti was friends with Capone's older brothers and their criminal gang (the Navy Street Boys).\n\nA worsening relationship with Dolendo urged him to leave home when he was 14 in 1900 to work in various local factories. Around 1910, at the age of 24, he left Brooklyn. The next several years of his life are poorly documented, and little can be ascertained. He may have worked in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn around 1911. He probably moved to Chicago around 1913, working as a barber and making the acquaintance of gangsters Alex Louis Greenberg and Dean O'Banion. He married Chicagoan Rosa (Rose) Levitt in Dallas, Texas, on October 18, 1917. The couple's movements after their marriage remain uncertain. He is known to have become a partner in the Galveston crime syndicate run by \"Johnny\" Jack Nounes. He is reported to have stolen a large sum of money from Nounes and fellow mobster Dutch Voight, after which Nitti fled to Chicago. By 1918, Nitti had settled there at 914 South Halsted Street. Nitti quickly renewed his contacts with Greenberg and O'Banion, becoming a jewel thief, liquor smuggler, and fence. Through his liquor smuggling activities, Nitti came to the attention of Chicago crime boss Johnny \"Papa Johnny\" Torrio and Torrio's newly arrived soldier, Al Capone.\n\nUnder Torrio's successor Al Capone, Nitti's reputation soared. Nitti ran Capone's liquor smuggling and distribution operation, importing whisky from Canada and selling it through a network of speakeasies around Chicago. Nitti was one of Capone's top lieutenants, trusted for his leadership skills and business acumen. Because Nitti's ancestry was from the same town as Capone's, he was able to help Capone penetrate the Sicilian and Camorra underworld in a way Capone alone never could. Capone thought so highly of Nitti that when he went to prison in 1929, he named Nitti as a member of a triumvirate that ran the mob in his place. Nitti was head of operations, with Jake \"Greasy Thumb\" Guzik as head of administration and Tony \"Joe Batters\" Accardo as head of enforcement. Despite his nickname (\"The Enforcer\"), Nitti used Mafia soldiers and others to commit violence rather than do it himself. In earlier days, Nitti had been one of Capone's trusted personal bodyguards, but as he rose in the organization, Nitti's business instinct dictated that he must personally avoid the \"dirty work\", for which hitmen were paid.\n\nFrank and Rose Nitti divorced in 1928, and shortly thereafter he married Anna Ronga Nitti, daughter of a mob doctor and former neighbor of the Nittis in the 1920s. The couple adopted a son, Joe.\n\nIn 1931, both 45-year-old Frank Nitti and 32-year-old Al Capone were convicted of tax evasion and sent to prison; however, Nitti received an 18-month sentence, while Capone was sent away for 11 years. Nitti was not a troublesome prisoner, but found the year-and-a-half confinement in a cell difficult because of the closed-in space. When Nitti was released in 1932, he took his place as the new boss of the Capone Gang.\n\nWhile some revisionist historians claim that Nitti was a mere \"front boss\" while others, namely Paul \"The Waiter\" Ricca, were the \"real\" bosses of the Chicago Outfit, both contemporary and modern accounts confirm that Capone's successor was indeed Frank Nitti. According to Nitti biographer Mars Eghigian, Nitti's age, brilliance, and reputation in the underworld made him Capone's personal choice for successor, rather than younger, less experienced mobsters such as Ricca or Murray Humphreys. In actuality, Paul Ricca was merely the acting boss of the Chicago Outfit for a six-month period between Capone's October 1931 imprisonment and Frank Nitti's April 1932 release. With the recently released Nitti paranoid about violating his federal parole, Ricca was acting in the capacity of emissary that same month when he was arrested with Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and other mobsters by Chicago police and prominently photographed. This picture would cause some to incorrectly infer that Paul Ricca was the new boss of the Chicago mob.\n\nWith Nitti calling the shots, the Chicago Outfit branched out from prostitution and gambling into other areas, including control of labor unions (which led to the extortion of many businesses). On December 19, 1932, a team of Chicago police, headed by Detective Sergeants Harry Lang and Harry Miller, raided Nitti's office in Room 554, at 221 N. LaSalle Street in Chicago. Lang shot Nitti three times in the back and neck. He then shot himself (a minor flesh wound) to make the shooting look like self-defense, claiming that Nitti had shot him first. Court testimony later insisted that the murder attempt was personally ordered by newly elected Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who supposedly wanted to eliminate the Chicago Outfit in favor of gangsters who answered to him. Nitti survived the shooting and, in February 1933, was acquitted of attempted murder. During that same trial, Miller testified that Lang received $15,000 to kill Nitti. Another uniformed officer who was present at the shooting testified that Nitti was shot while unarmed. Harry Lang and Harry Miller were both fired from the police force and each fined US$100 for simple assault. Two months later, Cermak was shot and killed by Giuseppe Zangara, a Calabrian immigrant. At the time, Cermak was talking to President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. Most historians believe, corroborated by Zangara's own comments and a note left behind at his room, that he intended to kill Roosevelt but missed and hit Cermak instead.\n\nAnna Nitto died on Nov. 19, 1940, in Mercy Hospital, Chicago, from an unspecified internal ailment. Nitti married Annette (Toni) Caravetta on May 14, 1942; she was widowed almost a year later when he committed suicide.\n\nIn 1943, many top members of the Chicago Outfit were indicted for extorting the Hollywood film industry. Among those prosecuted were Nitti, Phil D'Andrea, Louis \"Little New York\" Campagna, Nick Circella, Charles \"Cherry Nose\" Gioe, Ralph Pierce, Ricca, and John \"Handsome Johnny\" Roselli. The Outfit was accused of trying to extort money from some of the largest movie studios, including Columbia Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, RKO Pictures, and 20th Century Fox. The studios had cooperated with The Outfit to avoid union trouble (unrest itself stirred up by the mob). At a meeting of Outfit leaders at Nitti's home, Ricca blamed Nitti for the indictments. Ricca said that since this had been Nitti's scheme and that of the FBI informant (Willie Bioff) one of Nitti's trusted associates, Nitti should go to prison. A severe claustrophobe as a result of his first prison term, Nitti dreaded the idea of another prison confinement. It was also rumored that he was suffering from terminal cancer at this time. For these or possibly other reasons, he ultimately decided to take his own life.\n\nThe day before his scheduled grand jury appearance, Nitti had breakfast with his wife in their home at 712 Selborne Road in Riverside, Illinois. When his wife left for church, Nitti told her he planned to take a walk, then began to drink heavily. He then loaded a .32 caliber revolver, put it in his coat pocket, and walked five blocks to a local railroad yard. Conductor William F. Seebauer and switchmen L.M. Barnett and E.H. Moran were riding in the caboose, backing their train slowly southward over an ungated Cermak Road. The workers spotted an oblivious Nitti walking on the track away from them and shouted a warning. Nitti walked off the tracks, staggering towards the fence. Two shots rang out. The workers thought Nitti was shooting at them, then realized he was trying to shoot himself in the head. The first shot fired by Nitti's unsteady hand missed and passed through his fedora. The second bullet slammed into the right side of his jaw and exited through the top of his head, taking a lock of his hair with it and leaving the tuft protruding from the hole in the crown of the fedora. The final, fatal bullet entered behind Nitti's right ear and lodged in the top of his skull. Police Chief Allen Rose of North Riverside, rushing to the scene with a sergeant and several beat patrolmen, recognized Nitti immediately. An autopsy by William McNalley, coroner's toxicologist, showed that Nitti's blood alcohol level was 0.23. A coroner's jury ruled the following day that Nitti \"committed suicide while temporarily insane and in a despondent frame of mind\".\n\nFrank Nitti died on March 19, 1943, at the age of 57. Nitti is buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. Controversy has persisted regarding the interment of a suicide in a Catholic cemetery. Nitti's grave can be found to the left of the main Roosevelt Road entrance, about from the gate. It is marked \"Nitto\". To the right of the gate is the family plot containing the grave of Al Capone, marked by a white monument stone. Straight up from the gate are the graves of Dean O'Banion and Hymie Weiss, both North Side Gang members who were killed by the Chicago Outfit under Capone.\n\nWhile the name Frank Nitti has become infamous in American criminal history, the man himself never at any point in his life referred to himself as anything other than his birth name of Frank Nitto; only the police, media, and fringe mobsters called him Nitti.\n\nFrank Nitti has been portrayed numerous times in television and motion pictures:\n\n\nIn the 1983 film Easy Money, the Frank Nitti is the name of a kind of pizza ordered to Rodney Dangerfield's character's house.\n\n\nIce hockey goaltender Antero Niittymäki has used an image of Nitti on his helmet due to the similarity of their names.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a former Cabinet Minister and MP Member of Parliament, representing Kingo sub-county, which became Lwengo District.\n\nSsendaula was born on 15 May 1943 in Kyabbogo Village, Kingo sub-county, in Masaka District at that time, to the late Edward Byansi Kalibbala and Maria Nakanwagi Nakato. He is the oldest amongst eight siblings; six brothers and two sisters. In 2010, Kingo sub-county was peeled off Masaka District to create Lwengo District.\n\nHe started his education at Kyoko Primary School, and then transferred to Nkoni Primary School. He continued his studies at St. Pius Junior Secondary School. Because his father was less interested in educating children, Ssendaula's mother applied for a Buganda Government scholarship to take the young Ssendaula to a reasonable school but without success.\n\nHe later met with Aga Ssekalala of Ugachick who was then a student of Senior Four but knew some Buganda Kingdom officials. Aga Ssekalala later introduced Ssendaula to the Mengo establishment, leading to the re-activation of his scholarship application in 1963.\nA scholarship of Shs905 then enabled him to join Namilyango College, where he studied from Senior One to Senior Six. He later joined Nairobi University in 1969 where he graduated with the Bachelor of Commerce degree. There were about 30 other Ugandans at Nairobi University during his time, including Livingstone Okello Okello (Chua County), FDC's Cecilia Ogwal (Dokolo Woman MP), and Professor Mondo Kagonyera.\n\nAfter his studies in Kenya, Ssendaula returned to Barclays Bank in Uganda, where he had worked as a clerk during his S6 vacation. The two-year Barclays Bank London training known as 'Day Release' prepared him for an administrative role. He worked at the bank's Kabale branch before he was transferred to Nairobi to conduct some in-house training. He later returned to Uganda and rose to the rank of General Manager with Barclays Bank. He joined politics in 1980 and was elected MP for Bukoto, Masaka District, serving in that role until 1985, on the Democratic Party ticket, until 1985. He was elected Chairman of Masaka District in 1988 and served as such until 1992. In 1992, he was elected as the National Resistance Council (the Parliament of that time), representative for Bukoto, Masaka. He also contemporaneously served as the Chairman of Masaka Growers Cooperative Union.\n\nIn 1980 Ssendaula joined politics as a Democratic Party (DP) supporter contesting for Parliament MP and got elected for Bukoto Central (presently Bukomansimbi and Masaka Municipality). With UPC in power and DP in opposition, Ssendaula was shadow spokesman for Housing, while Evaristo Nyanzi was for Finance.\n\nIn 1982, Ssendula's wife, Rosemary Nanyonga Nalongo, was shot dead at their grocery in Mpererwe, 5miles on Gayaza Road, opposite their home. It was 2 pm and Ssendaula was in Masaka working at his father's coffee farm in Kinoni. The crime of his wife was apparently opening her shop while Minister Samwiri Mugwisa was addressing a rally in Kawempe, moreover speaking about rebel activities in the country.\n\nMrs. Ssendaula tried to reason with the soldiers who attacked her, that Kawempe, where the rally was being held, was far away from Mpererwe where her shop was. They didn't listen, shooting her there and then. With the murder of his wife at the back of his mind, Ssendaula left his Mpererwe home joining the National Resistance Army when the rebels started capturing territory around 1984. It was Commander Victor Bwana, who persuaded him to join Museveni's forces and he was too angry with the UPC government to resist the temptation.\n\nSsendaula helped the rebels export coffee beans and hides to get some revenue since he was attached to the defunct Masaka Cooperative Union. At that time in 1984, the NRA had established a government in the captured territory as the Kampala – Masaka road was cut off by the rebels, with their headquarters in Fort Portal. Ssendaula served in this 'government' as a commissioner, the equivalent of a minister.\n\nWhen the NRA captured power, he worked briefly at the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Secretariat, basically to wind up the rebels' export business as there was now a government to take care of it. In 1987, he went to Masaka, contested and got elected district chairman as its first District chairman under the NRM. He later joined the expanded National Resistance Council (NRC) legislature in 1989 as Bukoto MP.\n\nIn 1990, President Museveni appointed Ssendaula deputy minister of Commerce and Co-operatives under Richard Kaijuka, another banker. In 1996, he was promoted full minister for Natural Resources. At the beginning of 1998, Ssendaula became Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, a position he held until his retirement in 2005.\n\nHe joined politics representing the Democratic Party where he was the Member of Parliament for Bukoto constituency then the largest constituency in Uganda from 1980 – 1985 which was split into, Bukoto Central, Bukoto South, Bukoto Mid West later remaining as the MP for Bukoto South in then Masaka District.\n\nHe was elected on a Democratic Party ticket switching to the political setting, NRM – Movement. He continued to become a Cabinet Minister in the Museveni Government as the Deputy Minister of Commerce and Cooperatives, which Ministry was changed and Named Ministry of Trade and Industries from 1991– 1996. He rose to full Minister as the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment from 1996–1998, where he was transferred to The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development as its head through 1998–2005, where he retired from active politics.\n\n, he is a full-time farmer based in Masaka. He is also an Adviser to President Museveni on Financial Matters. He serves as a Consultant to the World Bank. He is the Chairman Uganda Revenue Authority, Chairman Board of Directors Tropical Bank, Director in Umeme Ltd and NUCAFE. He was married to Grace Tereza Nabatanzi Ssendawula, the daughter of Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere, the Ugandan Democratic Party politician. She died in 2011\n\n"}

She protested the results of 151 ballot boxes. Dy countered, questioning the results not only of the 151 precincts but all 812 precincts.

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Sheffield Hallam since 8 June 2017, and was elected as the Labour candidate.\n\nAfter joining Parliament, O'Mara became a member of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, but resigned in October 2017, following the publication of offensive comments about women and gay men that he had made in 2009 and earlier. \n\nO'Mara was suspended from the Labour Party on 25 October 2017, following further reports of online comments made before his election that have been described as racist, homophobic and misogynistic. O'Mara was reinstated in the Labour Party in July 2018, but resigned from the party nine days later. He now sits as an independent MP.\n\nO'Mara was born in Sheffield. He has cerebral palsy, hemiparesis and is on the autism spectrum. He was educated at Tapton School, in the city's Crosspool suburb, and graduated from Staffordshire University with a first class honours degree in Journalism. Before entering politics, he was a local school governor and had volunteered for Sheffield-based disability information services and charities. \n\nWith friends, he ran West Street Live, a bar and music venue in Sheffield.\n\nO'Mara had stood as a Labour candidate in various Sheffield council elections. He supported Jeremy Corbyn's election as Leader of the Labour Party in 2015 and 2016, was a Momentum supporter and was backed by them during the 2017 election.\n\nIn the 2017 general election, O'Mara contested the constituency of Sheffield Hallam, held by Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat leader and former Deputy Prime Minister. He was selected in an emergency selection process for the snap election under the control of the National Executive Committee and regional boards, rather than by the local constituency party. \n\nHis campaign benefited from a national surge in the Labour vote and from university students in the constituency. It has been claimed that Clegg was thought to be too anti-Brexit by voters, although Sheffield Hallam was estimated to have voted Remain in the 2016 European Union Referendum, and O'Mara supports Remain as well.\n\nO'Mara's campaign focused on disabled people's rights, protecting public services and on his personal background in Sheffield. He won the seat with a majority of 2,125 votes, overturning Clegg's previous majority of 2,353 votes. The result was considered one of the most important seat changes of the night; O'Mara had not expected to win the seat. His acceptance speech called for politicians to do more to stand up for disabled people.\n\nGiven his disability, the buildings of the House of Commons have presented problems for O'Mara as the terms of the Equality Act 2010 are yet to be met. \n\nO'Mara asked his first written question in October 2017.\n\nO'Mara became a member of the Women and Equalities Select Committee in September 2017. Following revelations of offensive comments he had made before becoming an MP, he resigned from the committee the following month.\n\nA series of derogatory comments about women and gay men posted by O'Mara on websites over a decade before he became an MP were revealed by the Guido Fawkes blog on 23 October 2017. He commented about the Girls Aloud pop group: \"I advise you to sack Sarah and the remaining four members (Nicola, Cheryl, Nadine and Kimberley) come have an orgy with me\"; and he said that the 2003 winner of \"Pop Idol\", Michelle McManus, had \"only won because she was fat\".\n\nHe has also been accused of making homophobic comments including referring to gay men as \"poofters\" and \"fudge packers\" and referring to jazz musician Jamie Cullum as a \"conceited cunt\" who should be \"sodomised with his own piano\". O'Mara apologised \"if his comments caused offence\" and resigned from the Women and Equalities Select Committee.\n\nThe following day, O'Mara was accused by Sophie Evans, a Sheffield bar worker whom he had met through an online dating app, on BBC Two's \"Daily Politics\" of having \"made transphobic slurs\" towards her in March 2017, and of saying in the same incident that she was an \"ugly bitch\". O'Mara denied the allegation. On the same day, it also emerged that he had been posting derogatory comments about children in Sheffield and appeared to advocate corporal punishment to deal with delinquent youth. Following the emergence of the comments to Evans, the Labour Party announced an investigation into O'Mara's conduct, but stopped short of suspending him from the party. \n\nFurther revelations were made public on 25 October 2017. On a Morrissey fan site in 2002, he was found to have made xenophobic insults, saying that Danes were \"pig shaggers\" who \"practised bestiality\" and referring to Spaniards as \"dagos\". O'Mara, when reviewing the Arctic Monkeys in November 2004, made several sexual comments including how \"sexy little slags\" danced to the band's songs. These revelations resulted in O'Mara being suspended from the Labour Party and therefore having the party whip withdrawn.\n\nIt was reported on 15 January 2018 that O'Mara had not spoken publicly in his constituency since his apology on 23 October. After the party whip was suspended, he cancelled his constituency surgery. In December 2017, a press statement explained that his leave was on the advice of his GP, who had discouraged him from attending Parliament, although O'Mara continued to deal with his constituents' casework. After three months' absence, O'Mara returned to the House of Commons on 17 January 2018 and voted on the report stage of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill.\n\nOn 3 July 2018, it was announced that O'Mara would be readmitted to the Labour Party, following a review by its National Executive Committee disputes panel; this review had decided to issue O'Mara a formal warning with a mandatory requirement to attend training, rather than refer the issue to the National Constitutional Committee which has the power to expel members. The decision was criticised by local Liberal Democrats, the closest challengers to Labour in Sheffield Hallam.\n\nIn an interview with ITV following his readmission, O'Mara said that he had made three attempts on his life during his suspension and had developed an anxiety disorder. He also revealed that he is on the autism spectrum, and believes that he is the first autistic MP in history. O'Mara restated his apology and asked for forgiveness from his constituents and the country. He refused to call a by-election and promised to make his maiden speech in July 2018.\n\nOn 12 July 2018, O'Mara announced his resignation from the Labour Party. He said that he had \"not been listened to or given a fair investigation\" following his suspension, and that the party \"no longer shares [his] commitment to the true definition of equality and compassion.\" Offering to help constituents with casework, he suggested that he would not step down as an MP. Despite his resignation, the Labour Party affirmed that it would continue to provide support for O'Mara; this was on the orders of Corbyn, who was concerned for O'Mara's welfare. On 18 July 2018, O'Mara announced that he would step back from his parliamentary duties on the advice of his GP. This coincided with a series of crucial votes on the Brexit negotiations, for which reason O'Mara had unsuccessfully applied to vote by proxy.\n\nO'Mara has never asked an oral question, and made his maiden speech on 24 July 2018, the day before the start of the summer recess. He was the 84th and final MP of the 2017 intake to make a maiden speech; the 83rd, David Duguid, spoke in November 2017.\n"}

She was declared missing in the early morning hours of June 27, 1995, soon after telling a colleague that she was on her way to work. As there were signs of a struggle outside her apartment, she is believed to have been abducted, but extensive investigations have failed to uncover any clues to her disappearance.\n\nHuisentruit was born in and grew up in Long Prairie, Minnesota, the youngest daughter of Maurice Nicholas Huisentruit (1920–1982) and Imogene L. \"Jane\" Huisentruit (née Anderson, 1923–2014). In high school, she was considered to be very good at golf. Her team won the state Class A tournament in 1985 and 1986. After high school, she went on to St. Cloud State University, where she studied mass communications and speech communication and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 1990. Her first job after graduation was with Northwest Airlines. She entered broadcasting by getting a job at KGAN in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as the station's Iowa City bureau chief, then returned to Minnesota for a job at KSAX in Alexandria before returning to Iowa for her KIMT position.\n\nOn the day before she disappeared, Huisentruit participated in a golf tournament and, according to Mason City resident John Vansice, she went to his home to view a video tape of the birthday party that he had arranged for her earlier in the month.\n\nAt about 4:00 am on Tuesday, June 27, 1995, KIMT producer Amy Kuns noted that Huisentruit had failed to report to work as scheduled, so she called Huisentruit's apartment. Huisentruit answered the telephone, explained that she had overslept, and said she was preparing to leave for the station. By 6:00 am, however, she had still not arrived, and Kuns filled in for her on the morning show \"Daybreak\". At about 7:00 am, KIMT staff called the Mason City police.\n\nWhen police arrived at Huisentruit's apartment they found her red Mazda Miata in the parking lot, as well as evidence suggesting there had been a struggle near that car. Among other evidence, Huisentruit's personal items, including a bent car key, were found strewn about the area and police reported recovering an unidentified palm print from her car.\n\nThe ensuing investigation revealed at least three neighbors in her apartment complex who said they heard screams at about the time Huisentruit would have likely been leaving for work. In addition, a neighbor who lived nearby reported seeing a white van with its running lights on parked in Huisentruit's parking lot at about the same time. This van was never positively identified.\n\nIn September 1995, the Huisentruit family hired private investigators from McCarthy & Associates, Investigative Services, Inc. (MAIS) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, who in turn enlisted the assistance of Omaha, Nebraska private investigator Doug Jasa. McCarthy and Jasa appeared on several national television shows, including \"America's Most Wanted\" and \"Unsolved Mysteries\". In November 1995, they and members of Jodi's family traveled to Los Angeles to meet with three prominent psychics. This meeting was televised and served as the pilot for the \"Psychic Detectives\" television show. Although each show generated a large volume of leads, none resulted in concrete evidence or the identification of a suspect.\n\nIn May 1996, about 100 volunteers searched an area of Cerro Gordo County and left flags to mark anything that appeared suspicious. Each of these sites was then re-examined by law enforcement, but no promising evidence was located.\n\nSince Huisentruit's disappearance in 1995, police and private investigators have conducted more than 1000 interviews relating to her disappearance. None have resulted in conclusive evidence pointing towards a suspect. Huisentruit was declared legally dead in May 2001.\n\nThere have been periodic resurgences in the story. When new cases arise that appear to bear similarities to Huisentruit's or remains are found in the area, speculation quickly leads to a connection with the missing reporter. So far, however, no suspect has been tied to Huisentruit's disappearance and all remains have proven to be from other sources. In 2005, many media outlets, including \"20/20\", again focused on the story as the 10th anniversary of the disappearance approached.\n\nIn early June 2008, photocopies of the 84 pages of Huisentruit's personal journal were anonymously mailed to a local newspaper. The Mason City \"Globe Gazette\" received the material in a large envelope with no return address and a June 4 postmark from Waterloo, Iowa. The original journal has been in the possession of law enforcement since the investigation of Huisentruit's disappearance began. \nWithin days, Mason City Police reported that the sender had come forward and then identified her as the wife of the former Mason City Police Chief. Although noting that the former chief had taken a copy of the journal home when he left office, the police gave no motive for his wife sending the copy to the newspaper.\n\nThe FBI, the Mason City Police Department, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, and MAIS's investigators are all still actively working on Huisentruit's disappearance, and the television show \"Nancy Grace: America's Missing\" spotlighted her case on February 23, 2011, and again on December 6, 2013.\n\nIn May 2015, all 100 members of the Iowa State House of Representatives signed a letter asking for the City of Mason City to declare June 27, 2015, as Jodi Huisentruit Day in honor of her memory and that of all victims in unsolved cases.\n\nIn December 2016, retiring Iowa State Representative John Kooiker of Sioux County, Iowa, described his experience with the case as a member of the Iowa State House Public Safety Committee and suggested a cover-up by Mason City officials. His opinion piece was published in \"The N'West Iowa Review\".\n\nIn March 2017, a search warrant was executed against person of interest John Vansice seeking GPS data for two of his vehicles.\n\n, Huisentruit has not been found, neither have remains been identified as hers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "160869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160869", "title": "Korean name", "text": "Korean name\n\nA Korean name consists of a family name followed by a given name, as used by the Korean people in both South Korea and North Korea. In the Korean language, \"ireum\" or \"seongmyeong\" usually refers to the family name (\"seong\") and given name (\"ireum\" in a narrow sense) together.\n\nTraditional Korean family names typically consist of only one syllable. There is no middle name in the English language sense. Many Koreans have their given names made of a generational name syllable and an individually distinct syllable, though this practice is declining in the younger generations. The generational name syllable is shared by siblings in North Korea, and by all members of the same generation of an extended family in South Korea. Married men and women keep their full personal names, and children inherit the father's family name unless otherwise settled when registering the marriage.\n\nThe family names are subdivided into \"bon-gwan\" (clans), i.e. extended families which originate in the lineage system used in previous historical periods. Each clan is identified by a specific place, and traces its origin to a common patrilineal ancestor.\n\nEarly names based on the Korean language were recorded in the Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE – 668 CE), but with the growing adoption of the Chinese writing system, these were gradually replaced by names based on Chinese characters (hanja). During periods of Mongol influence, the ruling class supplemented their Korean names with Mongolian names.\n\nBecause of the many changes in Korean romanization practices over the years, modern Koreans, when using languages written in Latin script, romanize their names in various ways, most often approximating the pronunciation in English orthography. Some keep the original order of names, while others reverse the names to match the usual Western pattern.\n\nAccording to the population and housing census of 2000 conducted by the South Korean government, there are a total of 286 surnames and 4,179 clans.\n\nFewer than 300 (approximately 280) Korean family names were in use in 2000, and the three most common (Kim, Lee, and Park) account for nearly half of the population. For various reasons, there is a growth in the number of Korean surnames. Each family name is divided into one or more clans (\"bon-gwan\"), identifying the clan's city of origin. For example, the most populous clan is Gimhae Kim; that is, the Kim clan from the city of Gimhae. Clans are further subdivided into various \"pa\", or branches stemming from a more recent common ancestor, so that a full identification of a person's family name would be clan-surname-branch. For example, \"Kyoungjoo Yissi\" also romanized as \"Kyoungjoo Leessi\" (Kyoung-Joo Lee clan, or Lee clan of Kyoung-Joo) and \"Yeonan-Yissi\" (Lee clan of Yeonan) are, technically speaking, completely different surnames, even though both are, in most places, simply referred to as \"Yi\" or \"Lee\". This also means people from the same clan are considered to be of same blood, such that marriage of a man and a woman of same surname and \"bon-gwan\" is considered a strong taboo, regardless of how distant the actual lineages may be, even to the present day.\n\nTraditionally, Korean women keep their family names after their marriage, but their children take the father's surname. In the premodern, patriarchal Korean society, people were extremely conscious of familial values and their own family identities. Korean women keep their surnames after marriage based on traditional reasoning that it is inherited from their parents and ancestors, and cannot be changed. According to traditions, each clan publishes a comprehensive genealogy (\"jokbo\") every 30 years.\n\nAround a dozen two-syllable surnames are used, all of which rank after the 100 most common surnames. The five most common family names, which together make up over half of the Korean population, are used by over 20 million people in South Korea.\n\nAfter the 2015 census, it was revealed that foreign-origin family names were becoming more common in South Korea, due to naturalised citizens transcribing their surnames in hangul. Between 2000 and 2015, more than 4,800 new surnames were registered. During the census, a total of 5,582 distinct surnames were collected, 73% of which do not have corresponding hanja characters. It was also revealed that despite the surge in the number of surnames, the ratio of top 10 surnames had not changed. 44.6% of South Koreans are still named Kim, Lee or Park, while the rest of the top 10 are made up of Choi, Jeong, Kang, Jo, Yoon, Jang and Lim.\n\nTraditionally, given names are partly determined by generation names, a custom originating in China. One of the two characters in a given name is unique to the individual, while the other is shared by all people in a family generation. In both North and South Korea, generational names are usually no longer shared by cousins, but are still commonly shared by brothers and sisters.\n\nGiven names are typically composed of \"hanja\", or Chinese characters. In North Korea, the \"hanja\" are no longer used to write the names, but the meanings are still understood; thus, for example, the syllable \"cheol\" (철, ) is used in boys' names and means \"iron\".\nIn South Korea, section 37 of the Family Registry Law requires that the\" hanja\" in personal names be taken from a restricted list. Unapproved \"hanja\" must be represented by \"hangul\" in the family registry. In March 1991, the Supreme Court of South Korea published the Table of Hanja for Personal Name Use, which allowed a total of 2,854 \"hanja\" in new South Korean given names (as well as 61 alternative forms). The list was expanded in 1994, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2015. Thus, 8,142 \"hanja\" are now permitted in South Korean names (including the set of basic \"hanja\"), in addition to a small number of alternative forms. The use of an official list is similar to Japan's use of the \"jinmeiyō kanji\" (although the characters do not entirely coincide).\n\nWhile the traditional practice is still largely followed, since the late 1970s, some parents have given their children names that are native Korean words, usually of two syllables. Popular given names of this sort include Haneul (; \"Heaven\" or \"Sky\"), Areum (; \"Beauty\"), Iseul (; \"Dew\") and Seulgi (; \"Wisdom\"). Between 2008 and 2015, the proportion of such names among South Korean newborns rose from 3.5% to 7.7%. The most popular such names in 2015 were Han-gyeol (한결) for boys and Sarang (; \"Love\") for girls. Despite this trend away from traditional practice, people's names are still recorded in both \"hangul\" and \"hanja\" (if available) on official documents, in family genealogies, and so on.\n\nOriginally, there was no legal limitation on the length of names in South Korea. As a result, some people registered extremely long given names composed of native Korean words, such as the 16-syllable Haneulbyeollimgureumhaennimbodasarangseureouri (; roughly, \"More beloved than the stars in the sky and the sun in the clouds\"). However, beginning in 1993, new regulations required that the given name be five syllables or shorter.\n\nThe usage of names is governed by strict norms in traditional Korean society. It is generally considered rude to address people by their given names in Korean culture. This is particularly the case when dealing with adults or one's elders. It is acceptable to call someone by his or her given name if he or she is the same age as the speaker. However, it is considered rude to use someone's given name if that person's age is a year older than the speaker. This is often a source of pragmatic difficulty for learners of Korean as a foreign language, and for Korean learners of Western languages.\n\nA variety of replacements are used for the actual name of the person. It is acceptable among adults of similar status to address the other by their full name, with the suffix \"ssi\" (氏, 씨) added. However, it is inappropriate to address someone by the surname alone, even with such a suffix. Whenever the person has an official rank, it is typical to address him or her by the name of that rank (such as \"Manager\"), often with the honorific \"nim\" (님) added. In such cases, the full name of the person may be appended, although this can also imply the speaker is of higher status.\n\nAmong children and close friends, it is common to use a person's birth name.\n\nAmong the common people, who have suffered from high child mortality, children were often given \"amyeong\" (childhood name), to wish them long lives by avoiding notice from the messenger of death. These sometimes-insulting nicknames are used sparingly for children today.\n\nUpon marriage, women usually lost their \"amyeong\", and were called by a \"taekho\", referring to their town of origin.\n\nIn addition, teknonymy, or referring to parents by their children's names, is a common practice. It is most commonly used in referring to a mother by the name of her eldest child, as in \"Cheolsu's mom\" (철수 엄마). However, it can be extended to either parent and any child, depending upon the context.\n\nKorean given names' correlation to gender is complex, and by comparison to European languages less consistent. Certain Sino-Korean syllables carry masculine connotations, others feminine, and others unisex. These connotations may vary depending on whether the character is used as the first or second character in the given name. A \"dollimja\" generational marker, once confined to male descendants but now sometimes used for women as well, may further complicate gender identification. Native Korean given names show similar variation.\n\nA further complication in Korean text is that the singular pronoun used to identify individuals has no gender. This means that automated translation often misidentifies or fails to identify individuals' gender in Korean text and thus presents stilted or incorrect English output. (Conversely, English source text is similarly missing information about social status and age critical to smooth Korean-language rendering.)\n\nChildren traditionally take their father’s family name. Under South Korean Civil Law effective 1 January 2008, though, children may be legally given the last name of either parent or even that of a step-parent.\n\nThe use of names has evolved over time. The first recording of Korean names appeared as early as in the early Three Kingdoms period. The adoption of Chinese characters contributed to Korean names. A complex system, including courtesy names and pen names, as well as posthumous names and childhood names, arose out of Confucian tradition. The courtesy name system in particular arose from the \"Classic of Rites\", a core text of the Confucian canon.\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms period, native given names were sometimes composed of three syllables like Misaheun (미사흔) and Sadaham (사다함), which were later transcribed into \"hanja\" (未斯欣, 斯多含). The use of family names was limited to kings in the beginning, but gradually spread to aristocrats and eventually to most of the population.\n\nSome recorded family names are apparently native Korean words, such as toponyms. At that time, some characters of Korean names might have been read not by their Sino-Korean pronunciation, but by their native reading. For example, the native Korean name of Yeon Gaesomun (연개소문; 淵蓋蘇文), the first Grand Prime Minister of Goguryeo, can linguistically be reconstructed as \"Eol Kasum\" (/*älkasum/). Early Silla names are also believed to represent Old Korean vocabulary; for example, Bak Hyeokgeose, the name of the founder of Silla, was pronounced something like \"Bulgeonuri\" (弗矩內), which can be translated as \"bright world\".\n\nIn older traditions, if the name of a baby is not chosen by the third trimester, the responsibility of choosing the name fell to the oldest son of the family. Often, this was the preferred method as the name chosen was seen as good luck.\n\nAccording to the chronicle \"Samguk Sagi\", family names were bestowed by kings upon their supporters. For example, in 33 CE, King Yuri gave the six headmen of Saro (later Silla) the names Lee (이), Bae (배), Choi (최), Jeong (정), Son (손) and Seol (설). However, this account is not generally credited by modern historians, who hold that Confucian-style surnames as above were more likely to have come into general use in the fifth and subsequent centuries, as the Three Kingdoms increasingly adopted the Chinese model.\n\nOnly a handful of figures from the Three Kingdoms period are recorded as having borne a courtesy name, such as Seol Chong. The custom only became widespread in the Goryeo period, as Confucianism took hold among the literati. In 1055, Goryeo established a new law limiting access to the civil service examination to those with family names.\n\nFor men of the aristocratic \"yangban\" class, a complex system of alternate names emerged by the Joseon period. On the other hand, commoners typically only had a first name. Surnames were originally a privilege reserved for the \"yangban\" class, but members of the middle and common classes of Joseon society frequently paid to acquire a surname from a \"yangban\" and be included into a clan; this practice became rampant by the 18th century, leading to a significant growth in the \"yangban\" class but conversely diluting and weakening its social dominance. For instance, in the region of Daegu, the \"yangban\" who had comprised 9.2% of Daegu's demographics in 1690 rose to 18.7% in 1729, 37.5% in 1783, and 70.3% in 1858. It was not until the Gabo Reform of 1894 that members of the outcast class were allowed to adopt a surname. According to a census called the \"minjeokbu\" (民籍簿) completed in 1910, more than half of the Korean population did not have a surname at the time.\n\nFor a brief period after the Mongol invasion of Korea during the Goryeo dynasty, Korean kings and aristocrats had both Mongolian and Sino-Korean names. The scions of the ruling class were sent to the Yuan court for schooling. For example, King Gongmin had both the Mongolian name Bayan Temür (伯顏帖木兒) and the Sino-Korean name Wang Gi (王祺) (later renamed Wang Jeon (王顓)).\n\nDuring the period of Japanese colonial rule of Korea (1910–1945), Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese-language names.\n\nIn 1939, as part of Governor-General Jiro Minami's policy of cultural assimilation (同化政策; \"dōka seisaku\"), Ordinance No. 20 (commonly called the \"Name Order\", or \"Sōshi-kaimei\" (創氏改名) in Japanese) was issued, and became law in April 1940. Although the Japanese Governor-General officially prohibited compulsion, low-level officials effectively forced Koreans to adopt Japanese-style family and given names. By 1944, about 84% of the population had registered Japanese family names.\n\n\"Sōshi\" (Japanese) means the creation of a Japanese family name (\"shi\", Korean \"ssi\"), distinct from a Korean family name or \"seong\" (Japanese \"sei\"). Japanese family names represent the families they belong to and can be changed by marriage and other procedures, while Korean family names represent paternal linkages and are unchangeable. Japanese policy dictated that Koreans either could register a completely new Japanese family name unrelated to their Korean surname, or have their Korean family name, in Japanese form, automatically become their Japanese name if no surname was submitted before the deadline.\n\nAfter the liberation of Korea from Japanese rule, the Name Restoration Order (조선 성명 복구령; 朝鮮姓名復舊令) was issued on October 23, 1946, by the United States military administration south of the 38th parallel north, enabling Koreans to restore their original Korean names if they wished.\n\nJapanese conventions of creating given names, such as using \"子\" (Japanese \"ko\" and Korean \"ja\") in feminine names, is seldom seen in present-day Korea, both North and South. In the North, a campaign to eradicate such Japanese-based names was launched in the 1970s. In the South, and presumably in the North as well, these names are regarded as old and unsophisticated.\n\nIn English-speaking nations, the three most common family names are often written and pronounced as \"Kim\" (김), \"Lee\" or \"Rhee\" (이, 리), and \"Park\" (박). Despite official Korean romanization systems used for geographic and other names in North and South Korea, personal names are generally romanized according to personal preference. Thus, a family name such as \"Lee\" may also be found spelled \"I\", \"Yi\", \"Rhee\", and \"Rhie\".\n\nThe initial sound in \"Kim\" shares features with both the English 'k' (in initial position, an aspirated voiceless velar stop) and \"hard g\" (an unaspirated voiced velar stop). When pronounced initially, Kim starts with an unaspirated voiceless velar stop sound; it is voiceless like , but also unaspirated like . As aspiration is a distinctive feature in Korean but voicing is not, \"Gim\" is more likely to be understood correctly. \"Kim\" is used nearly universally in both North and South Korea.\n\nThe family name \"Lee\" is pronounced as 리 (\"ri\") in North Korea and as 이 (\"i\") in South Korea. In the former case, the initial sound is a liquid consonant. There is no distinction between the alveolar liquids and , which is why \"Lee\" and \"Rhee\" are both common spellings. In South Korea, the pronunciation of the name is simply the English vowel sound for a \"long e\", as in 'see'. This pronunciation is also often spelled as \"Yi\"; the Northern pronunciation is commonly romanized \"Ri\".\n\nIn Korean, the name that is usually romanized as \"Park\" has no 'r' sound, unlike in American English, since the romanization was based on English English, which has r-dropping. Its initial sound is an unaspirated voiceless bilabial stop, like English 'b' at the beginning of words. The vowel is , similar to the 'a' in father and so the name is also often transcribed \"Pak\" or \"Bak.\"\n\nIn English publications, usually Korean names are written in the original order, with the family name first and the given name last. This is the case in Western newspapers. Koreans living and working in Western countries have their names in the Western order, with the given name first and the family name last. The usual presentation of Korean names in English is similar to those of Chinese names and differs from those of Japanese names, where they, in English publications, are usually written in a reversed order with the family name last.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for \"Synergy\", his 1975–1987 series of synthesizer music albums, and for his contributions to a number of popular music acts, including Peter Gabriel, Foreigner, Nektar, and Hall & Oates.\n\nFast grew up in Livingston, New Jersey and attended Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, where he obtained a degree in History. There he took his previous training in piano and violin and melded them with computer science to become interested in synthesized music and to build his own primitive sound-making electronic devices.\n\nHe was introduced to Rick Wakeman, the keyboard player from the band Yes, during a local radio interview, and traveled to the UK to work with Yes on their 1974 album \"Tales from Topographic Oceans\". It was there that he got a recording contract with Passport Records.\n\nFast recorded a series of pioneering synthesizer music albums under the project name Synergy.\n\nThe first album in the series, \"Electronic Realizations for Rock Orchestra\", was released as an LP in 1975. Like the following albums, it exclusively makes use of electronic instruments, mainly synthesizers. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Fast released eight more Synergy LPs on Passport Records, all of which were later re-released on CDs. The 1998 re-release of \"Semi-Conductor\", a compilation album originally released in 1984, was a remastered version of the original, and contained ten additional tracks. The eleventh album in the series, \"Reconstructed Artifacts\", was released in 2003, and contained completely new performances of select compositions from the previous albums, using modern digital synthesizers, as well as the new digital recording technologies.\n\nAt least two tracks from the album \"Audion\" (1981) were used as the basis for music in Commodore 64 computer games: Rob Hubbard's scores for the C64 version of \"\" and \"Master of Magic\", which were unofficial covers of songs \"Ancestors\" and \"Shibolet\".\n\nSynergy's first album states \"..and nobody played guitar.\" The second album, Sequencer, says \"...and still no guitars.\" These are rumored to be a tongue-in-cheek response to statements that appeared on albums by the rock group Queen that they used no synthesizers, which were made to inform listeners who assumed otherwise. Fast's third Synergy album, Cords, states \"Finally, guitars...sort of,\" which references the use of a Russ Hamm Guitar Synthesizer played by Pete Sobel.\n\nIn August 2013, one of Fast's newest tracks in several years, \"Tower Indigo\", was released on the Projekt Records compilation \"Possibilities of Circumstance\".\n\nThe albums by Synergy are:\n\nCurrently Fast is slowly developing a new Synergy album. This will be his first studio album consisting of new material in over twenty years. According to Fast's website, it will make heavy use of software synthesizers (one of which is, fittingly, Sample Logic's Synergy synthesizer) rather than the hardware equipment he had been using so far. He has amassed a lot of new thematic material and plans to rework some old, as yet unreleased pieces for the new album as well.\n\nIn addition to the \"Synergy\" albums, Fast made contributions to musical projects headed by other people:\n\nFast has done some work with designing listening devices for the hearing disabled; his wife had been working in the field for some time. Fast owns several patents for audio distribution using infrared optical technologies.\nFast is also part of a government group aiming to protect some of New Jersey's historic assets against developers.\n\n"}
{"id": "2250567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250567", "title": "Line infantry", "text": "Line infantry\n\nLine infantry was the type of infantry that composed the basis of European land armies from the middle of the 17th century to the middle of the 19th century. For both battle and parade drill, it consisted of two to four ranks of foot soldiers drawn up side by side in rigid alignment, and thereby maximizing the effect of their firepower. By extension, the term came to be applied to the regular regiments \"of the line\" as opposed to Foot Guards, light infantry, skirmishers, militia, support personnel, plus some other special categories of infantry not focused on heavy front line combat.\n\nLine infantry mainly used three formations in its battles: the line, the square and the column.\n\nWith the massive proliferation of small arms (firearms that could be carried by hand, as opposed to cannon) in the infantry units from the middle of 17th century, the battlefield was dominated by linear tactics, according to which the infantry was aligned into long thin lines and fired volleys. A line consisted of 2, 3 or 4 ranks of soldiers.\n\nAccording to the instructions, the soldiers were supposed to fire at volleys at the command of officers. But in a real battle, this happened only in the first minutes of the battle. After one or two volleys, each soldier charged a musket and fired at his own discretion, without hearing the commands of the officers. Which of course brought confusion to the system, and the smoke interfered with the accurate shooting. Such a shootout in a puff of smoke could occur for a very long period of time and inflicted huge losses on both sides, and the result was unpredictable. In addition, at the time of the “hot” shootout, the soldiers were so busy and focused on shooting that they could not notice the attack of cavalry from the flank. Therefore, experienced officers tried to avoid such costly shootouts and restrained their soldiers from premature firing, in order to get closer to the enemy’s line as close as possible and solve the battle with several crushing volleys at a short distance. In some cases, it was possible to overturn the enemy with just one volley at a short distance. \nThe line was considered as the fundamental battle formation as it allowed for the largest deployment of firepower. Troops in skirmish formation, though able to take cover and use initiative, were highly vulnerable to cavalry and could not hold ground against advancing infantry columns. Line infantry provided an 'anchor' for skirmishers and cavalry to retreat to if threatened.\n\nAgainst surrounding enemy cavalry, line infantry could swiftly adopt square formations to provide protection. Such squares were hollow (consisting of four lines), unlike the pikemen' and old-style musketeers' square.\n\nMovement in line formation was very slow, and unless the battalion was superbly trained, a breakdown in cohesion was virtually assured, especially in any kind of uneven or wooded terrain. As a result, line was mostly used as a stationary formation, with troops moving in column formations and then deploying to line at their destination. Usually, columns would be adopted for movement and melee attacks.\n\nLine infantry was trained in the manual of arms evolutions, the main objectives of which were fast deployment of a line, rapid shooting and manoeuvre.\n\nLine tactics required a strict discipline and simple movements, practiced to the point where they became second-nature. During training, the drill and corporal punishments were widely used.\n\nLine infantry quickly became the most common type of infantry in European countries. Musketeers and grenadiers, formerly elite troops, gradually became part of the line infantry, switching to linear tactics.\n\nOver time the use of line infantry tactics spread outside of Europe, often as a result of European imperialism. In European colonies and settlements with small populations from the home country, line infantry forces were often raised from the local population, with the British East India Company's sepoys perhaps being the most historically significant example.\n\nDuring 1814, the War of the Six Coalition, regular French line infantry recruits were trained very infirmitively due to the fierce attack of the Coalition Forces. A recruit was trained by firing two cartridges and four blanks. There was also light training of forming several formations. By these examples, forming a massive extent of well trained, elite line infantry was a very complicated process.\n\nIn the middle of the 16th century, the matchlock muskets of some line infantry were equipped with bayonets. Bayonets were attached to the muzzles of muskets and were used when line troops entered melee combat. They also helped to defend against cavalry.\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, a flaw within the design of matchlock muskets became more apparent. Since the matchlock musket used a slow burning piece of twine know as a slow match, the twine sometimes would accidentally set fire to the gunpowder reservoir in the musket prematurely setting off all of the gunpowder and bringing serious injury and death to the operator. During this time, matchlock muskets began to be replaced by lighter and cheaper infantry fusils with flintlocks, weighing 5 kg with a caliber of 17.5 mm, first in France and then in other countries. In many countries, the new fusils retained the name \"musket\". Both muskets and fusils were smoothbore, which lessened their accuracy and range, but made for faster loading, lesser amount of bore fouling and more robust, less complicated firearms.\n\nThe range and accuracy of smooth-bore muskets was in the range of 300-400 yards against the line of infantry / cavalry. In a single enemy could get from a distance of no more than 50-100 yards. It should be borne in mind that ordinary linear infantrymen were poorly trained in aimed shooting, due to the saving of gunpowder and lead (modern reenactors achieve much better results by firing smooth-bore muskets). But the line infantrymen were well trained in fast reloading muskets. The recruit should have done at least 3 rounds a minute, and an experienced soldier could have done up to 6 rounds per minute.\n\nThe bulk of the line infantry had no protective equipment, as armor that could provide protection from musket fire were considered too expensive and heavy. Only the former elite troops could keep by tradition some elements of protection, for example, the copper mitre caps of grenadiers.\n\nInitially, soldiers equipped with firearms formed only a small part of the infantry branch of most armies, because of their vulnerability to hostile cavalry. Pikemen formed the majority of infantrymen and were known as heavy infantry. A significant part of infantry consisted of old-style musketeers, who did not use the linear tactics, instead skirmishing in open formation. However, by the middle of the 17th century, musketeers deployed in line formation already provided about half of the foot troops in most Western European armies. Maurice of Nassau was noted as the first large scale user of linear tactic, introducing the 'counter-march' to enable his formations of musketeers to maintain a continuous fire. After the invention of the bayonet, musketeers could finally defend themselves from the enemy's horsemen, and the percentage of pikemen fell gradually. In 1699, the Austrian army got rid of their pikes. In 1703, the French army did the same, in 1704 the British and 1708 the Dutch. In 1699–1721, Peter I converted almost all Russian foot-regiments to line infantry. The abandonment of the pike, together with the faster firing rate made possible by the introduction of the new flintlock musket and paper cartridge, resulted in the abandonment of the deeper formations of troops more ideal for the melee-oriented pikemen. Instead, military thinking switched to shallower lines that maximized the firepower of an infantry formation.\n\nBesides regular line infantry, there were elite troops (royal guards and other designated elite regiments) and the light infantry. Light infantry operated in extended order (also known as skirmish formation) as opposed to the close order (tight formations) used by line infantry. Since the late 18th century, light infantry in most European countries mostly consisted of riflemen (such as the German Jäger), armed with rifled carbines and trained in aimed shooting and use of defilades. In England, much of the light infantry was armed with smooth-bore muskets, only a few regiments used rifled muskets. In the Russian Empire, light infantry was forming at a very fast pace; by the end of the 18th century, light infantry regiments numbered 40,000 soldiers (jaeger). In the Russian army, light infantry weapons were significantly different from line infantry. Light infantrymen were armed with short, high-quality manufacturing muskets. In addition, each light infantryman was armed with a pistol with a flintlock. Line infantry, whose muskets with bayonets were heavier than carbines, became known as heavy infantry and were used as the main deciding force.\n\nIn France, during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, the division into the Guard, while line infantry and light infantry formally continued to exist, line and \"light\" regiments had identical weaponry (smooth-bore fusils) and tactics. (Napoleon preferred smooth-bore weaponry for their faster reload speeds.) However, each battalion in both line and \"light\" regiments included a company of voltigeurs, who were expected to act as skirmishers as well being able to deploy into line.\n\nAfter the unsuccessful army reforms of Paul I, the number of light infantry in the Russian army was significantly reduced and made up only 8% of the entire field infantry. But soon the Russian army returned to the trend of increasing the number of light infantry, begun in the 18th century. By 1811, 50 light infantry regiments were formed in the Russian army. In addition, in each linear battalion it was required to have 100 of the best shooting soldiers who fought in a loose ranks and covered their battalions from the enemy skirmishers. The total number of light infantry reached 40% of the entire field infantry. Unfortunately, the sharp increase in the number of light infantry greatly influenced their quality of training and equipment. The Russian infantry of 1854 comprised 108 regiments, of which 42 were line infantry. The remainder were specialized or elite units such as Guards, Grenadiers and Jägers. Only part of the Russian light infantry were equipped with the M1854 rifle, the remainder retaining smoothbore percussion muskets.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the coming of mass production and new technologies, such as the Minie ball, allowed European armies to gradually equip all their infantrymen with rifled weapons, and the percentage of line infantry equipped with muskets fell. In the American Civil War, both Northern and Confederate armies had only a few line regiments equipped with the old-style smooth-bore muskets. However, France, due to Napoleon III, who admired Napoleon I, had 300 line battalions (comprising an overwhelming majority) even in 1870. Although the French line infantry received Chassepot rifles in 1866, it was still being trained in the use of close formations (line, column and square), which was changed only after the dethronement of Napoleon III. This was common practice in all conventional Western armies until the late 19th century, as infantry tactics and military thinking had yet to catch up with the new technological development.\n\nIn the years after the Napoleonic Wars, line infantry continued to be deployed as the main battle force, while light infantry provided fire support and covered the movement of units. In Russia, Great Britain, France, Prussia and some other states, linear tactics and formation discipline were maintained into the late 19th century.\n\nWith the invention of new weaponry, the concept of line infantry began to wane. The Minié ball (an improved rifle ammunition), allowed individual infantrymen to shoot more accurately and over greatly increased range. Men walking in formation line-abreast became easy targets, as evidenced in the American Civil War. The Austro-Prussian War in 1866 showed that breech-loading rifles, which gave the individual shooter a greatly increased rate of fire, were greatly superior to muzzleloaded rifles. In the 1860s, most German states and Russia converted their line infantry and riflemen into 'united' infantry, which used rifles and skirmish tactics. After the Franco-Prussian War, both the German Empire and the French Third Republic did the same. However, Great Britain retained the name \"line infantry\", although it used rifled muskets from 1853, breech loading rifles from 1867, and switched from closed lines to extended order during Boer wars.\n\nThe growing accuracy and rate of fire of rifles, together with the invention of the Maxim machine gun in 1883, meant that close order line infantry would suffer huge losses before being able to close with their foe, while the defensive advantages given to line infantry against cavalry became irrelevant with the effective removal of offensive cavalry from the battlefield in the face of the improved weaponry. With the turn of the 20th Century, this slowly led to infantry increasingly adopting skirmish style light infantry tactics in battle, while retaining line infantry drill for training.\n\nWhile, as detailed above, linear battle tactics had become obsolete by the second half of the nineteenth century, regiments in a number of European armies continued to be classified as \"line infantry\" (or cavalry). This designation had come to mean the regular or numbered regiments of an army, as opposed to specialist or elite formations. Accordingly, the distinction had become one of traditional title or classification without significance in respect of armament or tactics. As an example, the \nBelgian Army of 1914 comprised 14 regiments of \"Infanterie de Ligne\" (line infantry), three of \"Chasseurs a pied\" (light infantry), one of \"Grenadiers\" and one of \"Carabiniers\". Similar differentiations were made in the majority of European armies of the period, although English-speaking authors sometimes use the designation \"line infantry\" when referring to the ordinary infantry of some other countries where the exact term was not in use.\n\nThe term was also used by US units during the Second World War, as shown by this quote from a report of the 782nd Tank Battalion in late April 1945:\nOn the 22nd of April, the Battalion moved from Oberkotzau, Germany to Wunsiedel, Germany. Here the attachment of the line companies to the Regimental Combat Teams of the 97th Division was completed. We separated, not coming together again until the war was over. Company \"A\" joined the 303rd at Rehau, Germany: Company \"B\" joined the 386th at Arzburg, Germany: and Company \"C\" the 387th at Waldsassen, Germany.\n\nThe modern British Army retains the traditional distinction between \"Guards\", \"Line Infantry\" and \"the Rifles\" on ceremonial occasions for historical reasons. It is linked to the order of precedence within the British Army and regimental pride, so for example Colonel Patrick Crowley states in the \"introduction\" in \"A Brief History of The Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment\" (2015):\n\nInfantry of most 21st-century armies are still trained in formation manoeuvre and drill, as a way of instilling discipline and unit cohesion. Members of the US Army utilize the term \"line company\" (informally) in light infantry battalions to differentiate those companies (generally A–D) that perform the traditional infantry role from the support companies (generally F and HHC) charged with supporting the \"line companies\". The Marine Corps does the same for all its infantry units. In this vein, officers assigned to the rifle companies are referred to as \"line officers\" while billeted to positions such as Platoon Leaders and Commanding and Executive Officers.\n\n"}

{"id": "1036067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1036067", "title": "Peter Lalor", "text": "Peter Lalor\n\nPeter Fintan Lalor (; 5 February 1827 – 9 February 1889) was an Irish-Australian rebel and, later, politician who rose to fame for his leading role in the Eureka Rebellion, an event controversially identified with the \"birth of democracy\" in Australia. He is famous for being the only outlaw to make it to parliament.\n\nPeter Lalor was born into a house of 14 people in Raheen, in Queen's County, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (now County Laois, Republic of Ireland), the son of Patrick \"Patt\" Lalor, a landowner and supporter of the abolition of tithes who held a seat in the House of Commons from 1832 to 1835. He was the first Catholic MP for Queen's County since the reign of James II. His mother was Ann, née Dillon. They had 11 sons and daughters, of whom Lalor was the youngest.\n\nHis eldest brother was James Fintan Lalor, who was involved in the Young Ireland movement and the unsuccessful rebellion of 1848. Another brother, Richard Lalor, served as a Parnellite nationalist in the House of Commons. His mother died on 4 June 1835 and his father married Ellen Mary Anne Loughnan, with whom he had no children.\n\nLalor was educated at Carlow College and then trained as a civil engineer at Trinity College, Dublin.\n\nThree of the Lalor brothers migrated to America and fought on both sides of the Civil War. However, Peter and his brother Richard decided to go to Australia, arriving in Victoria in October 1852. Lalor worked first in the construction of the Melbourne–Geelong railway line, but resigned to take part in the Victorian Gold Rush. He began mining in the Ovens Valley, then moved to the Eureka Lead at Ballarat where he befriended Duncan Gillies (who later became Premier of Victoria). His brother Richard returned to Ireland, becoming politically active and himself a member of the House of Commons.\n\nThe agitation against the goldfields licences (which were 30 shillings each) began at Bendigo in 1853, and was quickly taken up at Ballarat, and a Reform League was formed amongst the diggers on the various goldfields for the redress of grievances. In October 1854, the Government ordered the police to go out hunting for unlicensed diggers two times a week.\n\nIn the later half of 1854 a digger named James Scobie was killed in a scuffle at the Eureka Hotel, on Specimen Hill; Bentley who was the publican, was considered by the diggers to have participated in the murder. He and others were charged with the murder and arrested, but with the police court, they were discharged.\n\nA indignation meeting was held at Ballarat on 17 October, close to the spot where Scobie was killed. At this meeting a committee was appointed, of which Peter Lalor was one. The authorities, fearing that the meeting might lead to an attack on Bentley's hotel, sent police to act as a guard over it. A youth threw a stone at the lamp in front of the building, breaking the glass. That act of violence, was the spark. With cries of \"Down with the house\" and \"Burn it.\", the angry mob stormed the hotel and set fire to it. Three people were arrested, and charged with act of incendiarism, and were committed and imprisoned.\n\nA mass meeting was held on Bakery Hill on 11 November 1854, to demand the release of the alleged incendiaries. It also passed resolutions affirming the right of the people to full representation, manhood suffrage, the abolition of the property qualification for members, payment of members, short Parliaments, and the abolition of the Gold Commission and the diggers' licenses. Bentley, in the meantime, had been re-arrested on the advice of the Attorney-General William Stawell for the murder of Scobie, and convicted. He was sentenced to three years on the roads.\n\nOn 29 November a meeting of about 12,000 men was held at Ballarat. This is said to be the first public meeting that Mr. Lalor addressed. He moved one of the resolutions submitted and passed. It called for a meeting of the Reform League for the following Sunday to elect a central committee. The \"insurgent flag \" was hoisted on the platform. It represented the Southern Cross constellation. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting declared the license fee to be an unjustifiable imposition. A bonfire was soon kindled and the licences burnt. At this meeting, the rebellion was formally inaugurated.\n\nLalor led the miners' opposition against the incompetent and often brutal administration of the goldfields, and was elected to lead the men in the armed uprising after the meeting on Bakery Hill. The diggers formed a barricade, where they were attacked by troops and police on 3 December. Lalor was seriously wounded in the left arm, resulting in its amputation. A warrant for Lalor's arrest on charges of sedition was initially sought, but he was taken from Ballarat and hidden by his supporters in the Young Queen Hotel at South Geelong. The warrant was withdrawn in June 1855 after juries had found 13 other ringleaders not guilty of sedition.\n\nAs a result of the uprising a number of the miners' complaints were resolved. Legislation was passed to give miners the right to vote. A new form of licensing of Miners Rights costing £1 per year was introduced.\nThe monthly gold tax was abolished. A general amnesty for the three miners arrested after the Bentley's Eureka Hotel fire and the 114 arrested at the Eureka Stockade was proclaimed.\n\nWhile the victors of Eureka were removing them alive from the stockade, Peter Lalor, the diggers' leader, lay under the pile of slabs in which he had been hidden, bleeding from the wound in his arm. A musket ball had shattered the bone close to the shoulder, and the few who knew where he was lying saw the blood trickling from beneath the pile of slabs even while the soldiers, keen to capture him, were still in the stockade.he was angry. When the last of them had gone, Lalor was helped from his hiding place, put upon a white horse, and rode away through the bush towards Warrenheip. There he claimed shelter at the hut of a man he knew. The digger was absent, and his wife went to look for him. Lalor, however, doubted her genuineness, and believing that she had gone to communicate with the police, he took to the bush again for shelter. All that night he wandered about, with his crushed arm still swinging useless and unattended. He was greatly weakened from loss of blood, and only his indomitable pluck kept him up. Towards morning he determined to seek assistance from Stephen Cummins, an old friend whom he could trust, and who lived with his wife on Pennyweight Hill.\n\nIt was on the early morning of the Monday following the fight that Mrs. Cummins drew her husband's attention to a man walking slowly between the holes on the flat, and said, \"That is Peter Lalor; I feel sure of it\". \"As I ran down to help him\", Steve Cummins told a friend, \"his face was grey and worried. He looked like a frail old man rather than a powerful young one, so greatly had pain and loss of blood during the 24 hours weakened him. I helped him into the hut, where as well as we could, my wife and I bandaged the wounded arm. I knew that my hut was no place for him. A reward of £200 had been offered for his arrest, and there were many mean spirits keen to earn it. Our friendship was well known, and I felt sure that sooner or later my place would be searched by the police. I ran at once across the gully to the Roman Catholic Presbytery and told Father Smyth that Lalor was in my tent badly wounded and in need of surgical assistance. I told him my fears as to the police visiting us, and Father Smyth said, 'He will be safer here, I think. Bring him over after dark.' So that night we took him across to the presbytery, meeting, fortunately, not a soul upon the road.\" Steve Cummins's intuition had served him well, for next night the police searched his hut, just at the time when he was watching Drs. Doyle and Stewart amputating Peter Lalor's arm, for the severity of the wound and the delay in treating it precluded any possibility of the arm being saved. Through the ordeal of amputation, as in every other emergency of life, he showed that fine courage which nothing could shake!\n\nA man employed about the Presbytery took the severed arm away as soon as the operation was over, and threw it down an abandoned shaft, but by Father Smyth's orders it was recovered later and properly buried. The first operation was not complete. A portion of the bullet remained lodged in the stump of the arm, and it was only after a second operation at Geelong that the wound healed properly.\n\nDue to the political changes caused by the Eureka Stockade, Lalor was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council in November 1855 as Member for the new district of Ballaarat, and remained in this role until March 1856. In November 1856, under the new, more democratic constitution (featuring near-universal white male suffrage) Lalor was elected unopposed to the Legislative Assembly seat of North Grenville (Ballarat West). As he was the Eureka hero his policies were not scrutinised at all before the election and his later voting record as a parliamentarian shows he once opposed a bill to introduce full white male suffrage in the colony of Victoria.\n\nDuring a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, \"I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Communism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.\"\n\nWeston Bate wrote that the role of landowner and company director seemed to suit him more than that of rebel, and that Peter Lalor \"disgraced himself in democratic eyes\" by trying to use Chinese as strike-breakers at the Clunes mine, of which he was a director. Some argue that he was ruthless in using low-paid Chinese workers to get rid of Australians seeking better and safer working conditions. In parliament he supported a repressive land Bill in 1857 which favoured the rich. There were 17,745 Ballarat signatures to a petition against Lalor's land Bill. Withers and others were puzzled and hurt that the folk hero should prove to be a better fighter for money and political position than for the people's rights. Like many young radicals he undoubtedly became more conservative in later life. However, he was consistent in being a risk-taker and, in his later business career, undoubtedly suffered lows as well as highs, at one point narrowly avoiding having to declare bankruptcy. Lalor held North Grenville until August 1859, but never represented Ballarat again, and in the October 1859 election he stood for and won South Grant in the Legislative Assembly instead.\n\nLalor held South Grant for over eleven years after this point, finally losing it in January 1871. In 1871 he also contested but lost the seat of North Melbourne. In May 1874 he was re-elected to South Grant, holding it until April 1877, then taking the Legislative Assembly seat of Grant in May 1877, which he would hold for another almost twelve years until his death in February 1889.\n\nLalor's key political postings were as Commissioner Trade & Customs and Postmaster-General of Victoria from August to October 1875, then Commissioner Trade & Customs from May 1877 until March 1880, as well as postmaster-general again from May to July 1877. Lalor also served as chairman of committees in the period from 1859 to 1868.\n\nAs successor to Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, his most effective political post was probably that of Speaker, a post he held from 1880 until 1887 when illness forced his retirement; he was awarded a pension of £4,000 by parliament.\n\nLalor married Alicia Dunne on 10 July 1855 in Geelong. Their daughter, Anne (Annie), was born in Prahran in 1856; their son Joseph was born at Sandridge (now called Port Melbourne) on 18 December 1857. Annie Lalor married Thomas Lempriere in 1882, but died three years later of pulmonary phthisis. Joseph Lalor became a medical doctor, marrying Agnes McCormick of Dublin, Ireland and leaving descendants.\n\nAlicia Lalor died on 17 May 1887 at the age of 55 years. Following her death, Peter Lalor took leave from Parliament and visited San Francisco, California.\n\nLalor died on Saturday, 9 February 1889 at age 62 at his son's home in Richmond and was buried at the Melbourne General Cemetery.\n\nA statue of Peter Lalor was erected at Sturt Street in Ballarat in 1893. It was presented to the municipality by a friend of Lalor's, James Oddie, who was also first Chairman of the city, and was unveiled by another friend, the Premier, the Hon. Duncan Gillies.\n\nThe Melbourne suburb of Lalor, Victoria, was named after him in 1945. The suburb was originally pronounced \"LAW-luh\", after Peter Lalor, and although many people still pronounce it as such, in recent times the pronunciation \"LAY-lor\" has become predominant.\n\nA federal electorate in the south-western suburbs of Melbourne, the Division of Lalor, was named after him in 1948. It has been held successively by senior Labor figures Reg Pollard, Jim Cairns, Barry Jones and Julia Gillard. The suburb of Lalor is not in the electorate, which is pronounced \"LAW-luh\".\n\nLalor Street in Ballarat East was also named in his honour.\n\nThe University of Ballarat (now known as Federation University Australia) honoured him by naming one of the two Mt Helen campus' Halls of Residence after him (the other being named after Bella Guerin, the first woman to graduate from an Australian university).\n\nPortrayals of Lalor's role in the Eureka Rebellion appear in film.<br>\nThe first film to have Lalor appear in is supposed to be \"Eureka Stockade (1907 film)\", but only a seven-minute fragment thereof has survived. In 1915, Lalor was portrayed by Leslie Victor in the silent film The Loyal Rebel – this film is also considered lost.\nNext, he was played by Chips Rafferty in the 1949 British film \"Eureka Stockade\" (released in United States of America under the title, \"Massacre Hill\".) He was played by Australian actor Bryan Brown in \"Eureka Stockade\", a two-part television mini-series which aired on the Seven Network in 1984. The last film to date to picture Lalor was the Australian documentary \"Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854\" from 2006, with Lalor played by Andrew Larkins.\n\nFor further information about the various films depicting Peter Lalor, see: Eureka Rebellion#Film and television.\n\nLalor has also been depicted in the commemorative Son et lumière \"Blood Under the Southern Cross\" at Sovereign Hill since 1992.\n\nA caricature bollard by artist Jan Mitchell depicting Peter Lalor holding the Eureka flag was erected on the Geelong foreshore in 1999 as part of the Waterfront Geelong bollard walk.\n\nHis portrait is featured on two commemorative postage stamps, a 38c Ireland stamp released on 3 May 2001 in the \"Rebel Spirit, Irish Heritage of Australia\" series and a 2004 AUD2.45 Australian stamp commemorating the Eureka Stockade.\n\n\nAdditional sources listed by the \"Australian Dictionary of Biography\":\n"}

This was Piazzolla’s first orchestra of his own and from this spring board he would later go on to pioneer \"nuevo tango\", a new approach to the genre, with his Octeto Buenos Aires.\n\nEarly in his career Piazzolla played in a number of orquesta típicas, including that of the renowned bandoneonist Aníbal Troilo from 1939. During this period he began to study classical orchestration with Alberto Ginastera, the eminent Argentine composer, and took piano lessons with the Argentine classical pianist Raúl Spivak. Piazzolla combined this with a gruelling performing schedule in the tango clubs at night and between 1944 and 1946 he went on to lead the orchestra of the tango singer and bandoneonist Francisco Fiorentino.\n\nFeeling restricted by the limitations of traditional tango, Piazzolla formed his \"Orquesta Típica\" in 1946 and began to experiment with a new approach to the orchestration and musical content of tango. A number of formations for the orchestra were tried including: Astor Piazzolla, Roberto Di Filippo, Angel Genta, and Fernando Tell (bandoneon); Hugo Baralis, Cacho Gianni, Juan Bibiloni, and F. Lucero (violin); Atilio Stampone (piano), Angel Molo (cello) and Pepe Diaz (double bass).\n\nOver the next two years, Piazzolla recorded 30 pieces with this orchestra, mostly new arrangements of traditional tangos such as \"Taconeando\", \"Inspiración\", \"Tierra querida\", \"La rayuela\" and \"El recodo\", but also a number of his own compositions, including \"El disbande\" (his first formal composition), \"Pigmalion\", \"Villeguita\", and \"Se armo\". His works would quickly become classics in the repertoire of some of the most popular tango orchestras of the day, including those of Anibal Troilo, Osvaldo Fresedo and Jose Basso.\n\nThe young Piazzolla’s music established itself as a distinct and contemporary sound which began to provoke comment amongst traditional \"tanguero\"s . By 1950 he felt the need to disband the orchestra and to try something different, not even convinced at this stage in his life that he should make his career in tango. He concentrated now on the study of classical music, including a year in Paris with the French classical composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, before returning to Buenos Aires where he would finally commit himself to tango with the founding of his next ensemble, Octeto Buenos Aires, in 1955. This would put him in the vanguard of \"nuevo tango\" and lead him into a head-on collision with the tango music establishment.\n\n"}

{"id": "105407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=105407", "title": "Rod Stewart", "text": "Rod Stewart\n\nSir Roderick David Stewart, (born 10 January 1945) is a British rock singer and songwriter. Born and raised in London, he is of Scottish and English ancestry. Stewart is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. He has had six consecutive number one albums in the UK and his tally of 62 UK hit singles includes 31 that reached the top ten, six of which gained the #1 position. Stewart has had 16 top ten singles in the US, with four reaching #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.\n\nWith his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart came to prominence in the late 1960s and the early 1970s with The Jeff Beck Group, and then with Faces, though his music career had begun in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In October 1963, he joined The Dimensions as a harmonica player and part-time vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars, and in August, Stewart signed a solo contract, releasing his first single, \"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\", in October. He maintained a solo career alongside a group career, releasing his debut solo album, \"An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down\" in 1969. Stewart's early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music, and R&B.\n\nFrom the late 1970s through the 1990s, Stewart's music often took on a new wave or soft rock/middle-of-the-road quality, and in the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the Great American Songbook. In 1994, Stewart staged the largest free rock concert in history when he performed in front of 3.5 million people in Rio de Janeiro. In 2008, \"Billboard\" magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the \"Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists\". A Grammy and Brit Award recipient, he was voted at #33 in \"Q Magazine\"s list of the Top 100 Greatest Singers of all time, and #59 on \"Rolling Stone\" 100 Greatest Singers of all time. As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and was inducted a second time into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Faces.\n\nRoderick David Stewart was born at 507 Archway Road, Highgate, North London on 10 January 1945, the youngest of five children of Robert Joseph Stewart (26 December 1904–1990) and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart (14 December 1905–1996). His father was Scottish and had been a master builder in Leith, Edinburgh, while Elsie was English and had grown up in Upper Holloway in North London. Married in 1928, the couple had two sons and two daughters while living in Scotland, and then they moved to Highgate. Stewart came after an eight-year gap following his youngest sibling; he was born at home during World War II. The family was neither affluent nor poor; Stewart was spoiled as the youngest, and has called his childhood \"fantastically happy\". He had an undistinguished record at Highgate Primary School and failed the eleven plus exam. He then attended the William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later Fortismere School), Muswell Hill. When his father retired from the building trade he bought a newsagent's shop on the Archway Road and the family lived over the shop. Stewart's main hobby was railway modelling.\n\nThe family was mostly focused on football; Stewart's father had played in a local amateur team and managed some teams as well, and one of Stewart's earliest memories was of the pictures of Scottish players such as George Young and Gordon Smith that his brothers had on the wall. Stewart was the most talented footballer in the family and was a supporter of Arsenal F.C. at the time. Combining natural athleticism with near-reckless aggression, he became captain of the school football team and played for Middlesex Schoolboys as centre-half.\n\nThe family were also great fans of the singer Al Jolson and would sing and play his hits. Stewart collected his records and saw his films, read books about him, and was influenced by his performing style and attitude towards his audience. His introduction to rock and roll was hearing Little Richard's 1956 hit \"The Girl Can't Help It\", and seeing Bill Haley & His Comets in concert. His father bought him a guitar in January 1959; the first song he learned was the folk tune \"It Takes a Worried Man to Sing a Worried Song\"; the first record he bought was Eddie Cochran's \"C'mon Everybody\". In 1960, he joined a skiffle group with schoolfriends called the Kool Kats, playing Lonnie Donegan and Chas McDevitt hits.\n\nStewart left school at age 15 and worked briefly as a silk screen printer. Spurred on by his father, his ambition was to become a professional footballer. In summer 1960, he went for trials at Brentford F.C., a Third Division club at the time. Contrary to some longstanding accounts, Stewart states in his 2012 autobiography that he was never signed to the club and that the club never called him back after his trials. In any case, regarding possible career options, Stewart concluded, \"Well, a musician's life is a lot easier and I can also get drunk and make music, and I can't do that and play football. I plumped for music ... They're the only two things I can do actually: play football and sing.\"\n\nStewart worked in the family shop and as a newspaper delivery boy. He then worked briefly as a labourer for Highgate Cemetery, which became another part of his biographical lore. He worked in a North Finchley funeral parlour and as a fence erector and sign writer. In 1961 he went to Denmark Street with The Raiders and got a singing audition with well-known record producer Joe Meek, but Meek stopped the session with a rude sound. Stewart began listening to British and American topical folk artists such as Ewan MacColl, Alex Campbell, Woody Guthrie, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, and especially Derroll Adams and the debut album of Bob Dylan.\n\nStewart became attracted to beatnik attitudes and left-wing politics, living for a while in a beatnik houseboat at Shoreham-by-Sea. He was an active supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament at this time, joining the annual Aldermaston Marches from 1961 to 1963 and being arrested on three occasions when he took part in sit-ins at Trafalgar Square and Whitehall for the cause. He also used the marches as a way to meet and bed girls. In 1962 he had his first serious relationship, with London art student Suzannah Boffey (a friend of future model and actress Chrissie Shrimpton); he moved to a bed-sit in Muswell Hill to be near her. She became pregnant, but neither Rod nor his family wanted him to enter marriage; the baby girl was given up for adoption and Rod's and Suzannah's relationship ended.\n\nIn 1962, Stewart began hanging around folk singer Wizz Jones, busking at Leicester Square and other London spots. Stewart took up playing the then-fashionable harmonica. On several trips over the next 18 months Jones and Stewart took their act to Brighton and then to Paris, sleeping under bridges over the River Seine, and then finally to Barcelona. Finally this resulted in Stewart being rounded up and deported from Spain for vagrancy during 1963. At this time, Stewart, who had been at William Grimshaw School with three of their members, was briefly considered as singer for the embryonic Kinks.\n\nIn 1963, Stewart adopted the Mod lifestyle and look, and began fashioning the spiky rooster hairstyle that would become his trademark. (It was made possible with sugar water or large amounts of his sisters' hair lacquer, backcombing, and his hands holding it in place to protect it from the winds of the Highgate Underground station.) Disillusioned by rock and roll, he saw Otis Redding perform in concert and began listening to Sam Cooke records; he became fascinated by rhythm and blues and soul music.\n\nAfter returning to London, Stewart joined a rhythm and blues group, the Dimensions, in October 1963 as a harmonica player and part-time vocalist. It was his first professional job as a musician, although Stewart was still living at home and working in his brother's painting and picture frame shop. A somewhat more established singer from Birmingham, Jimmy Powell, then hired the group a few weeks later, and it became known as Jimmy Powell & the Five Dimensions, with Stewart being relegated to harmonica player. The group performed weekly at the famed Studio 51 club on Great Newport Street in London, where The Rolling Stones often headlined; this was Stewart's entrée into the thriving London R & B scene, and his harmonica playing improved in part from watching Mick Jagger on stage. Relations soon broke down between Powell and Stewart over roles within the group and Stewart departed. Contrary to popular legend, during this time Stewart likely did not play harmonica on Millie Small's 1964 hit \"My Boy Lollipop\". That was probably Peter Hogman of the Dimensions, although Powell has also claimed credit. Powell did record and release a single during this period, though Stewart did not appear on it.\n\nIn January 1964, while Stewart was waiting at Twickenham railway station after having seen Long John Baldry and the All Stars at Eel Pie Island, Baldry heard him playing \"Smokestack Lightnin'\" on his harmonica, and invited him to sit in with the group (which passed into his hands and was renamed the Hoochie Coochie Men when Cyril Davies died of endocarditis on 7 January); when Baldry discovered Stewart was a singer as well, he offered him a job for £35 a week, after securing the approval of Stewart's mother. Quitting his day job at age nineteen, Stewart gradually overcame his shyness and nerves and became a visible enough part of the act that he was sometimes added to the billing as \"Rod the Mod\" Stewart, the nickname coming from his dandyish style of grooming and dress. Baldry touted Stewart's abilities to \"Melody Maker\" magazine and the group enjoyed a weekly residence at London's fabled Marquee Club. In June 1964, Stewart made his recording début (without label credit) on \"Up Above My Head\", the B-side to a Baldry and Hoochie Coochie Men single. While still with Baldry, Stewart embarked on a simultaneous solo career. He made some demo recordings, was scouted by Decca Records at the Marquee Club, and signed to a solo contract in August 1964. He appeared on several regional television shows around the country and recorded his first single in September 1964.\n\nTurning down Decca's recommended material as too commercial, Stewart insisted that the experienced session musicians he was given, including John Paul Jones, learn a couple of Sonny Boy Williamson songs he had just heard. The resulting single, \"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\", was recorded released in October 1964; despite Stewart performing it on the popular television show \"Ready Steady Go!\", it failed to enter the charts. Also in October Stewart left the Hoochie Coochie Men after having a row with Baldry.\n\nStewart played some dates on his own in late 1964 and early 1965, sometimes backed by the Southampton R & B outfit The Soul Agents. The Hoochie Coochie Men broke up, Baldry and Stewart patched up their differences (and indeed became lifelong friends), and legendary impresario Giorgio Gomelsky put together Steampacket, which featured Baldry, Stewart, Brian Auger, Julie Driscoll, Micky Waller, Vic Briggs and Ricky Fenson; their first appearance was in support of The Rolling Stones in July 1965. The group was conceived as a white soul revue, analogous to The Ike & Tina Turner Revue, with multiple vocalists and styles ranging from jazz to R & B to blues. Steampacket toured with the Stones and The Walker Brothers that summer, ending in the London Palladium; seeing the audience react to the Stones gave Stewart his first exposure to crowd hysteria. Stewart, who had been included in the group upon Baldry's insistence, ended up with most of the male vocal parts. Steampacket was unable to enter the studio to record any material due to its members all belonging to different labels and managers, although Gomelsky did record one of their Marquee Club rehearsals.\n\nStewart's \"Rod the Mod\" image gained wider visibility in November 1965, when he was the subject of a 30-minute Rediffusion, London television documentary titled \"An Easter with Rod\" that portrayed the Mod scene. His parallel solo career attempts continued on EMI's Columbia label with the November 1965 release of \"The Day Will Come\", a more heavily arranged pop attempt, and the April 1966 release of his take on Sam Cooke's \"Shake\", with the Brian Auger Trinity. Both failed commercially and neither gained positive notices. Stewart had spent the better part of two years listening mostly to Cooke; he later said, \"I didn't sound like anybody at all ... but I knew I sounded a bit like Sam Cooke, so I listened to Sam Cooke.\" This recording solidified that singer's position as Stewart's idol and most enduring influence; he called it a \"crossing of the water.\"\n\nStewart departed from Steampacket in March 1966, with Stewart saying he had been sacked and Auger saying he had quit. Stewart then joined a somewhat similar outfit, Shotgun Express, in May 1966 as co-lead vocalist with Beryl Marsden. The other members included Mick Fleetwood and Peter Green (who would go on to form Fleetwood Mac), and Peter Bardens. Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy \"I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round\", before disbanding. Stewart later disparaged Shotgun Express as a poor imitation of Steampacket, and said \"I was still getting this terrible feeling of doing other people's music. I think you can only start finding yourself when you write your own material.\" By now, Stewart had bounced around without achieving much success, with little to distinguish himself among other aspiring London singers other than the emerging rasp in his voice.\n\nGuitarist Jeff Beck recruited Stewart for his new post-Yardbirds venture, and in February 1967, Stewart joined the Jeff Beck Group as vocalist and sometime songwriter. This would become the big break of his early career. There he first played with Ronnie Wood whom he had first met in a London pub in 1964; the two soon became fast friends. During its first year, the group experienced frequent changes of drummers and conflicts involving manager Mickie Most wanting to reduce Stewart's role; they toured the UK, and released a couple of singles that featured Stewart on their B-sides. Stewart's sputtering solo career also continued, with the March 1968 release of non-hit \"Little Miss Understood\" on Immediate Records.\n\nThe Jeff Beck Group toured Western Europe in spring 1968, recorded, and were nearly destitute; then assistant manager Peter Grant booked them on a six-week tour of the United States starting in June 1968 with the Fillmore East in New York. Stewart, on his first trip to America, suffered terrible stage fright during the opening show and hid behind the amplifier banks while singing; only a quick shot of brandy brought him out front. Nevertheless, the show and the tour were a big success, with Robert Shelton of \"The New York Times\" calling the group exciting and praising \"the interaction of Mr. Beck's wild and visionary guitar against the hoarse and insistent shouting of Rod Stewart,\" and \"New Musical Express\" reporting that the group was receiving standing ovations and pulling receipts equal to those of Jimi Hendrix and The Doors.\n\nIn August 1968, their first album \"Truth\" was released; by October it had risen to number 15 on the US albums chart but failed to chart in the UK. The album featured Beck's masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart's dramatic vocalising tackled the group's varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-heavy metal. Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs, and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice. The group toured America again at the end of the year to a very strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval (something that would continue throughout Beck's career). In July 1969, Stewart left, following his friend Wood's departure. Stewart later recalled: \"It was a great band to sing with but I couldn't take all the aggravation and unfriendliness that developed... In the two and a half years I was with Beck I never once looked him in the eye – I always looked at his shirt or something like that.\"\n\nThe group's second album, \"Beck-Ola\", was released in June 1969 in the US and September 1969 in the UK, bracketing the time the group was dissolving; it also made number 15 in the US albums chart and placed to number 39 in the UK albums chart. During his time with the group, Stewart initially felt overmatched by Beck's presence, and his style was still developing; but later Stewart felt the two developed a strong musical, if not personal, rapport. Much of Stewart's sense of phrasing was developed during his time with the Jeff Beck Group. Beck sought to form a new supergroup with Carmine Appice and Tim Bogert (of the similarly just-breaking-up Vanilla Fudge) joining him and Stewart, but Stewart had other plans.\n\nMercury Records A&R man Lou Reizner had seen Stewart perform with Beck, and on 8 October 1968 signed him to a solo contract; but contractual complexities delayed Stewart's recording for him until July 1969. Meanwhile, in May 1969, guitarist and singer Steve Marriott left English band The Small Faces. Ron Wood was announced as the replacement guitarist in June and on 18 October 1969, Stewart followed his friend and was announced as their new singer. The two joined existing members Ronnie Lane, Ian McLagan, and Kenney Jones, who soon decided to call the new line-up Faces.\n\n\"An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down\" became Stewart's first solo album in 1969 (it was known as \"The Rod Stewart Album\" in the US). It established the template for his solo sound: a heartfelt mixture of folk, rock, and country blues, inclusive of a British working-class sensibility, with both original material (\"Cindy's Lament\" and the title song) and cover versions (Ewan MacColl's \"Dirty Old Town\" and Mike d'Abo's \"Handbags and Gladrags\"). The backing band on the album included Wood, Waller and McLagan, plus Keith Emerson and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer, and later Armageddon and 7th Order) and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer).\n\nFaces released their début album \"First Step\" in early 1970 with a rock and roll style similar to the Rolling Stones. While the album did better in the UK than in the US, the Faces quickly earned a strong live following. Stewart released his second album, \"Gasoline Alley\" that autumn. Stewart's approach was similar to his first album and mandolin was introduced into the sound. He then launched a US tour with the Faces. Stewart sang guest vocals for the Australian group Python Lee Jackson on \"In a Broken Dream\", recorded in April 1969 but not released until 1970. His payment was a set of seat covers for his car. It was re-released in 1972 to become a worldwide hit.\n\nStewart's 1971 solo album \"Every Picture Tells a Story\" made him a household name when the B-side of his minor hit \"Reason to Believe\", \"Maggie May\", (co-written with Martin Quittenton) started receiving radio play. The album and the single occupied number one in both the US and the UK simultaneously, a chart first, in September. Set off by a striking mandolin part (by Ray Jackson of Lindisfarne), \"Maggie May\" was also named in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\", one of three songs by him to appear on that list. The rest of the album was equally strong, with \"Mandolin Wind\" again showcasing that instrument; \"(I Know) I'm Losing You\" adding hard-edged soul to the mix; and \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\", a cover of a Bob Dylan song. But the ultimate manifestation of the early Stewart solo style was the Stewart-Wood-penned \"Every Picture Tells a Story\" itself: powered by Mick Waller's drumming, Pete Sears's piano and Wood's guitar work in a largely acoustic arrangement; it is a song relating to the picaresque adventures of the singer.\n\nThe second Faces album, \"Long Player\", was released in early 1971 and enjoyed greater chart success than \"First Step\". Faces also got their only US Top 40 hit with \"Stay With Me\" from their third album \"A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse\" released in late 1971. This album reached the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic on the back of the success of \"Every Picture Tells A Story\". Steve Jones from The Sex Pistols regarded the Faces very highly and named them as a main influence on the British punk rock movement.\n\nThe Faces toured extensively in 1972 with growing tension in the band over Stewart's solo career enjoying more success than the band's. Stewart released \"Never a Dull Moment\" in the same year. Repeating the \"Every Picture\" formula, for the most part, it reached number two on the US album charts and number one in the UK, and enjoyed further good notices from reviewers. \"You Wear It Well\" was a hit single that reached number 13 in the US and went to number one in the UK, while \"Twisting the Night Away\" made explicit Stewart's debt to Sam Cooke. For the body of his early solo work Stewart earned tremendous critical praise. \"Rolling Stone\"'s 1980 \"Illustrated History of Rock & Roll\" includes this in its Stewart entry:\n\nRarely has a singer had as full and unique a talent as Rod Stewart; rarely has anyone betrayed his talent so completely. Once the most compassionate presence in music, he has become a bilious self-parody – and sells more records than ever [...] a writer who offered profound lyricism and fabulous self-deprecating humour, teller of tall tales and honest heartbreaker, he had an unmatched eye for the tiny details around which lives turn, shatter, and reform [...] and a voice to make those details indelible. [... His solo albums] were defined by two special qualities: warmth, which was redemptive, and modesty, which was liberating. If ever any rocker chose the role of everyman and lived up to it, it was Rod Stewart.\n\nThe Faces released their final album \"Ooh La La,\" which reached number one in the UK and number 21 in the US in 1973. During the recording of the album, the rift between Stewart and the rest of the Faces grew further, as (according to Ian McLagan), Stewart didn't participate until two weeks into the sessions, \"and then complained that some songs were in the wrong key for him. So we recorded them again and waited a week for him to come back. We cut the track for 'Ooh La La' three times before he eventually passed on it, leaving it for Woody to sing. [...] The week the album came out he did all he could to scuttle it and told anyone who would listen how useless it was.\". The band toured Australasia, Japan, Europe and the UK in 1974 to support the album and the single \"Pool Hall Richard\".\n\nIn late 1974, Stewart released his \"Smiler\" album. In Britain, it reached number one, and the single \"Farewell\" number seven, but only number 13 on the \"Billboard\" pop album charts and the single \"Mine for Me\" only number 91 on the \"Billboard\" pop singles charts. It was his last original album for Mercury Records. After the release of the double album compilation \"The Best of Rod Stewart\" he switched to Warner Bros. Records and remained with them throughout the vast majority of his career (Faces were signed to Warner Bros., and Stewart's solo releases in the UK appeared on the Riva label until 1981). In 1975, Faces toured the US twice (with Ronnie Wood joining The Rolling Stones' US tour in between) before Stewart announced the Faces' break-up at the end of the year.\n\nIn 1975, Stewart moved to Los Angeles. He released the \"Atlantic Crossing\" album for his new record company, using producer Tom Dowd and a different sound based on the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. \"Atlantic Crossing\" marked both a return to form and a return to the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" album charts. The first single, a cover of the Sutherland Brothers song \"Sailing\", was a number-one hit in the UK, but it only reached the Top 60 of the US charts. The single returned to the UK Top 10 a year later when used as the theme music for a BBC documentary series about \"HMS Ark Royal\". Having been a hit twice over, \"Sailing\" became, and remains, Stewart's biggest-selling single in the UK. His Holland-Dozier-Holland cover \"This Old Heart of Mine\" was also a Top 100 hit in 1976. In 1976 Stewart covered The Beatles' song \"Get Back\" for the musical documentary \"All This and World War II\".\n\nLater in 1976, Stewart topped the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for eight weeks and the Australian ARIA chart with the ballad \"Tonight's the Night\", with an accompanying music video featuring actress Britt Ekland. It came from the \"A Night on the Town\" album, which went to number two on the \"Billboard\" album charts and was Stewart's first album to go platinum. By explicitly marking the album as having a \"fast side\" and a \"slow side\", Stewart continued the trend started by \"Atlantic Crossing\". \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\", a cover of a Cat Stevens song, went number one in the UK in 1977, and top 30 in the US. \"The Killing of Georgie (Part 1 and 2)\", about the murder of a gay man, was also a Top 40 hit for Stewart during 1977.\n\n\"Foot Loose & Fancy Free\" (1977) featured Stewart's own band, the original Rod Stewart Group that featured Carmine Appice, Phil Chen, Jim Cregan, Billy Peek, Gary Grainger and John Jarvis. It continued Stewart's run of chart success, reaching number two. \"You're in my Heart\" was the hit single, reaching number four in the US.\n\n\"Hot Legs\" achieved a lot of radio airplay as did the confessional \"I Was Only Joking\". In appearance, Stewart's look had evolved to include a glam element, including make-up and spandex clothes. Stewart scored another UK number one and US number one single with \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\", which was a crossover hit reaching number five on the \"Billboard\" black charts due to its disco sound. This was the lead single from 1978's \"Blondes Have More Fun...or do they?,\" which went to number one on the \"Billboard\" album charts and sold 3 million albums.\n\nA focal point of criticisms about this period was his biggest-selling 1978 disco hit \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\", which was atypical of his earlier output, and disparaged by critics. In interviews, Stewart, while admitting his accompanying look had become \"tarty\", has defended the lyrics by pointing out that the song is a third-person narrative slice-of-life portrayal, not unlike those in his earlier work, and that it is not about him. The song's refrain was identical to Brazilian Jorge Ben Jor's earlier \"Taj Mahal\" and a lawsuit ensued. Stewart donated his royalties from \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" to UNICEF, and he performed it with his band at the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly in 1979.\n\nStewart moved to a more new wave direction in 1980 by releasing the album \"Foolish Behaviour\". The album produced one hit single, \"Passion\", which proved particularly popular in South Africa (reaching no. 1 on the Springbok Top 20 Charts and Radio 5 Charts in early 1981). It also reached No. 5 on the US \"Billboard\" Charts. In August 1981, MTV was launched in the US with several of Stewart's videos in heavy rotation. Later in 1981, Stewart added further elements of new wave and synthpop to his sound for the \"Tonight I'm Yours\" album. The title song reached No. 20 in the US, while \"Young Turks\" reached the Top 5 with the album going platinum. On 18 December 1981, Stewart played the Los Angeles Forum, along with Kim Carnes and Tina Turner, in a concert broadcast worldwide via satellite.\n\nStewart was criticised for breaking the widely observed cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa by performing at the Sun City resort complex in Bophuthatswana as part of his Body Wishes (1983) and Camouflage (1984) tours.\n\nStewart had four US Top 10 singles between 1982 and 1988, \"Young Turks\" (No. 5, carrying over from 1981 into 1982), \"Some Guys Have All the Luck\" (No. 10, 1984), \"Infatuation\" (No. 6, 1984) and \"Love Touch\" (No. 6, 1986, a Holly Knight/Mike Chapman collaboration), although \"Baby Jane\" became his sixth and final UK number one in 1983. It reached No. 14 in the US. The corresponding \"Camouflage\" album went gold in the UK, and the single \"Infatuation\" (which featured his old friend Jeff Beck on the guitar) received considerable play on MTV. The second single \"Some Guys Have All The Luck\" reached No. 15 in the UK and No. 10 in the US.\n\nA reunion with Jeff Beck produced a successful take on Curtis Mayfield's \"People Get Ready\", but an attempt to tour together fell apart after a few dates. In the UK, \"Every Beat of My Heart\" reached number two in 1986. In January 1985, Stewart performed to a large audience at the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn 1988, he returned with \"Out of Order\", produced by Duran Duran's Andy Taylor and by Bernard Edwards of Chic. \"Lost in You\", \"Forever Young\", \"Crazy About Her\", and \"My Heart Can't Tell You No\" from that album were all top 15 hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and mainstream rock charts, with the latter even reaching the Top Five. \"Forever Young\" was an unconscious revision of Bob Dylan's song of the same name; the artists reached an agreement about sharing royalties. The song reached No. 12 in the US. In September 1988, Stewart performed \"Forever Young\" at the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, and in 1989 he received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song.\n\nIn January 1989, Stewart set out on the South American leg of the Out of Order Tour playing to sell-out audiences throughout Americas. There were 80,000 people at his show at Corregidora Stadium, Querétaro, México (9 April), and 50,000 at Jalisco Stadium, Guadalajara, Jalisco (12 April). In Buenos Aires, the audience at the River Plate Stadium, which seats 70,000+, was at over 90,000, with several thousand outside the stadium. Firehoses were sprayed on the crowd to avoid heat prostration.\n\nStewart's version of the Tom Waits song \"Downtown Train\" went to number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1990. This song was taken from a four-CD compilation set called \"\".\n\nReleased in 1991, the \"Vagabond Heart\" album continued Stewart's renewal and inspiration. The lead single \"It Takes Two\" with Tina Turner, was released in 1990 in advance of the full album's release, and reached number five on the UK charts, but did not chart in the US. The follow-up songs from \"Vagabond Heart\" both reached the Billboard Hot 100 in 1991, with \"Rhythm of My Heart\" peaking at No. 5 and \"The Motown Song\" peaking at No. 10. \nAt the 1993 Brit Awards in London, Stewart picked up the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Stewart brought back the Faces on stage for an impromptu reunion. In 1993, Stewart recorded \"All For Love\" with Sting and Bryan Adams for the soundtrack to the movie \"The Three Musketeers\"; the single reached number one in the US and number two in the UK. Also in 1993, he reunited with Ronnie Wood to record an \"MTV Unplugged\" special that included \"Handbags and Gladrags\", \"Cut Across Shorty\", and four selections from \"Every Picture Tells a Story\". The show featured an acoustic version of Van Morrison's \"Have I Told You Lately\", which topped the \"Billboard\" adult contemporary chart and No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. A rendition of \"Reason to Believe\" also garnered considerable airplay. The resulting \"Unplugged...and Seated\" album reached number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 album charts.\n\nStewart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, presented by Jeff Beck. On 31 December 1994, Stewart played in front of 3.5 million people on Copacabana beach in Rio, and made it into the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for staging the largest free rock concert attendance in history.\n\nBy the early 1990s, Stewart had mostly abandoned creating his own material, saying that he was not a natural songwriter and that the tepid response to his recent efforts was not rewarding. In 1995, Stewart released \"A Spanner in the Works\" containing a single written by Tom Petty, \"Leave Virginia Alone\", which reached the Top 10 of the adult contemporary charts. The latter half of the 1990s was not as commercially successful though the 1996 album \"If We Fall in Love Tonight\" went gold and hit No. 19 on the \"Billboard\" album chart.\n\n\"When We Were the New Boys\", his final album on the Warner Bros. label released in 1998, contained versions of songs by Britpop acts such as Oasis and Primal Scream, and reached number two on the UK album charts. That same year, he recorded the song \"Faith of the Heart\", written by Diane Warren, for the film \"Patch Adams\". In 2000, Stewart left Warner Bros. and moved to Atlantic Records, another division of Warner Music Group. In 2001, he released \"Human\". The single \"I Can't Deny It\" went Top 40 in the UK and Top 20 in the adult contemporary. Stewart then signed to Clive Davis' new J Records label. \"The Story So Far: The Very Best of Rod Stewart\", a greatest hits album compiled from his time at Warner Bros., went to the Top 10 in the UK and reached number one in 2001 in, among other places, Belgium and France.\n\nIn June 2002, Stewart performed \"Handbags and Gladrags\" at the Party at the Palace held at Buckingham Palace Garden, a concert which celebrated the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II and featured stars from five decades of music.\n\nBy 2002, Stewart had sold over 100 million records during his career. He concentrated on singing 1930s and 1940s pop standards from the Great American Songbook, written by songwriters such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and George and Ira Gershwin, with great popular success. These albums have been released on Clive Davis's J Records label and have seen Stewart enjoy album sales equal to the 1970s.\n\nThe first album from the songbook series, \"\", reached number four on the US album chart, number eight in the UK and number ten in Canada when released in late 2002. The track \"These Foolish Things\" (which is actually a British, not American, song) reached number 13 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart, and \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\" went Top 20.\n\nThe second series album, \"\", reached number two in the US, number four in the UK and number one in Canada. \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\", a duet with Cher, went Top 20 on the US adult contemporary charts. \"Time After Time\" was another Top 30 track on the US adult contemporary charts. A musical called \"Tonight's The Night\", featuring many of Stewart's songs, opened 7 November 2003 at London's Victoria Palace Theatre. It is written and directed by Ben Elton, who previously created a similar production, \"We Will Rock You\", with music by Queen.\n\nIn 2004, Stewart reunited with Ronnie Wood for concerts of Faces material. A Rod Stewart and the Faces best of album, \"Changing Faces\", reached the Top 20 of the UK album charts. \"Five Guys Walk into a Bar...\", a Faces box set compilation, was released. In late 2004, \"\", the third album in Stewart's songbook series, was released. It was his first US number one album in 25 years, selling over 200,000 albums in its first week. It also debuted at number one in Canada, number three in the UK and Top 10 in Australia. His version of Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\", featuring Stevie Wonder, made the Top 20 of the world adult charts. He also recorded a duet with Dolly Parton for the album – \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\". Stewart won his first ever Grammy Award for this album.\n\n2005 saw the release of the fourth songbook album, \"\"; it included duets with Diana Ross and Elton John. Within weeks of its release, the CD made it to number two on the Top 200 list. In late 2006, Stewart made his return to rock music and his new approach to country music with the release of \"Still the Same... Great Rock Classics of Our Time\", a new album featuring rock and southern rock milestones from the last four decades, including a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\", which was released as the first single. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts with 184,000 copies in its first week. The number one début was helped by a concert in New York City that was on MSN Music and an appearance on \"Dancing with the Stars\". He performed tracks from his new album live from the Nokia Theater on 9 October. Control Room broadcast the event Live on MSN and in 117 cinemas across the country via National CineMedia. In November 2006, Stewart was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame.\n\nOn 1 July 2007, Stewart performed at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event which celebrated the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death. He performed \"Sailing\", \"Baby Jane\" and \"Maggie May\". On 12 December, he performed for the first time at the \"Royal Variety Performance\" at the London Coliseum in front of HRH Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, singing another Cat Stevens number, \"Father and Son\", and Bonnie Tyler's song \"It's a Heartache\". On 22 December 2006, Stewart hosted the 8th Annual \"A Home for the Holidays\" special on CBS at 8:00 pm (PST).\n\nOn 20 May 2009, Stewart performed \"Maggie May\" on the grand finale of \"American Idol\" season 8. On 2, July 2009 Stewart performed his only UK date that year at Home Park, Plymouth. On 29 September 2009 a 4-CD, 65-track compilation entitled \"Rod Stewart Sessions 1971–1998\" was released; it is composed of previously-unreleased tracks and outtakes from the bulk of his career. Stewart has also mentioned plans for a compilation of covers of soul classics, the possible release of another edition of the \"Great American Songbook\" album and a country covers album.\n\nOn 17 October 2009, Stewart released the studio album \"Soulbook\" which was composed of covers of soul and Motown songs. On 14 November 2009, Stewart recorded a TV program in the UK for ITV that was screened on 5 December 2009. The music in the programme featured tracks from his new album and some old favourites. On 14 January 2010, Rhino records released Stewart's \"Once in a Blue Moon\", a \"lost album\" originally recorded in 1992, featuring ten cover songs including the Rolling Stones' \"Ruby Tuesday\", Bob Dylan's \"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\" and Stevie Nicks' \"Stand Back\", as well as Tom Waits' \"Tom Traubert's Blues\". On 19 October 2010, Stewart released another edition of his Great American Songbook series titled \"Fly Me to the Moon...The Great American Songbook Volume V\" on J Records.\n\nIn 2011, Stewart performed with Stevie Nicks on their Heart & Soul Tour. Starting on 20 March in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the tour visited arena concerts in North America – with performances in New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Tampa and Montreal, among others.\n\nStewart headlined the Sunday show at the 2011 Hard Rock Calling Festival on 26 June in London's Hyde Park. Stewart signed on to a two-year residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, commencing on 24 August. Performing his greatest hits, the residency also saw him perform selected tracks from his upcoming, untitled blues album.\n\nOn 7 June 2012, it was announced that Stewart had signed a recording agreement with Universal Music Group. On 4 September 2012, it was announced that Stewart would be releasing his first Christmas album, titled \"Merry Christmas, Baby\", on the Verve Music Group label (a division of Universal Music Group) on 30 October 2012. The album was produced by David Foster and features several duets, as well as an original song written by Stewart, Foster and Amy Foster called \"Red-Suited Super Man\". According to IFPI, \"Merry Christmas, Baby\" was the seventh best-selling album worldwide in 2012.\n\nIn October 2012, Stewart's autobiography titled \"Rod: The Autobiography\" was released (exact dates vary worldwide).\n\nIn November 2012, Stewart performed \"Auld Lang Syne\" from his Christmas album and his hit \"Sailing\" at the Royal Albert Hall for the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance, which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Later that month, Stewart again performed at the Royal Albert Hall in front of the Queen during the 100th Royal Variety Performance, singing \"When You Wish upon a Star\".\n\nOn 26 November 2012, Stewart's recording of \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\" reached the top of the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary Chart. Stewart has had the number one song on this chart three times previously, the last being in 1993 with \"Have I Told You Lately\", giving him the second-largest hiatus between number ones in the history of the chart. The song remained in the No. 1 spot for a total of five weeks, tying it for the longest-leading holiday title in the chart's 51-year history.\n\nOn 10 December 2012, Stewart was a guest singer on Michael Bublé's television \"Home for the Holidays\" Christmas special.\n\nStewart was the tenth best-selling artist in Canada in the year 2012 according to year-end sales data from Nielsen Soundscan Canada. In February 2013, Stewart was nominated for a Canadian Juno Award in the International Album of the Year category for his album \"Merry Christmas, Baby\".\n\nIn May 2013, Stewart released \"Time\", a rock album of his own original material. It marked a return to songwriting after what Stewart termed \"a dark period of twenty years\"; he said that writing his autobiography gave him the impetus to write music again. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1, setting a new British record for the longest gap between chart-topping albums by an artist. Stewart's last No. 1 on the chart had been \"Greatest Hits Volume 1\" in 1979 and his last studio album to top the chart was 1976's \"A Night on the Town\".\n\nIn September 2013, Stewart presented his close friend Elton John with the first Brits Icon award in a special show at the London Palladium, recognising John's \"lasting impact\" on UK culture. Stewart quipped that John was \"the second-best rock singer ever\", before the two performed a duet on stage.\n\nOn 23 June 2015, Stewart announced the release of a new studio album, \"Another Country\". It was made available for pre-order and was released on 23 October 2015. The video for the first single \"Love Is\" is available on his Vevo account.\n\nStewart recorded vocals with Joe Walsh on the Frankie Miller album \"Frankie Miller's Double Take\", which was released on 30 September 2016.\n\nHe sang his cover of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" as Sgt. Pepper for \"Beat Bugs\" episode 17b which debuted 18 November 2016 on Netflix.\n\nOn September 28, 2018, Stewart released his 30th studio album, \"Blood Red Roses\", on Republic Records.\n\nIn May 2000, Stewart was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, for which he underwent surgery in the same month. It had been previously reported he suffered from a benign vocal cord nodule. Besides being a major health scare, the resulting surgery also threatened his voice, and he had to re-learn how to sing. Since then he has been active in raising funds for The City of Hope Foundation charity to find cures for all forms of cancer, especially those affecting children.\n\nBefore returning to the UK, Stewart played for his LA Exiles team made up of mostly English expatriates plus a few celebrities, including Billy Duffy of The Cult, in a senior soccer league in Palos Verdes, California.\n\nDespite his father being a supporter of Hibernian, Stewart is a supporter of Celtic, which he mentions in \"You're in My Heart\". He supports the Scotland national team and follows Manchester United as his English side, and he explains his love affair with both Celtic and Manchester United in Frank Worrall's book, \"Celtic United\". Stewart clarifies this more in his 2012 book (pp 163–64), \"Rod: The Autobiography\", mentioning he \"only had an attachment to Manchester United in the 1970s, but that was because they had so many great Scottish players in the 1970s, including Denis Law ... When I did eventually click with a team, it was Celtic\". He presented Celtic with the trophy after they won the 2015 Scottish League Cup Final.\n\nStewart is a model railway enthusiast. His HO scale layout in his Los Angeles home is modeled after the New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroads during the 1940s. Called the Three Rivers City, the layout was featured in the cover story of the December 2007, December 2010, February 2014, and June 2017 issues of \"Model Railroader\" magazine. In the 2007 article, Stewart said that it meant more to him to be in a model railroad magazine than a music magazine. The layout, which has a mainline run of , uses code 70 flextrack and a Digital Command Control (DCC) system made by Digitrax. Stewart has a second, smaller layout at his UK home, based on Britain's East Coast Main Line. In a sidebar to the 2014 \"Model Railroader\" article, Stewart admitted (in an anecdote about his having unwittingly mixed red scenery texturing material into a \"turf\" mix he used around the bases of buildings) that he is colour-blind.\n\nAn auto collector, Stewart owns one of the 400 Ferrari Enzos. In 1982, Stewart was car-jacked on Los Angeles' Sunset Boulevard, while he was parking his $50,000 Porsche. The car was subsequently recovered.\n\nIn September 2002, Stewart's son, Sean, was sentenced to three months in jail for attacking a man outside a restaurant in Los Angeles. Sean Stewart was also required to pay compensation and to attend anger management, drug and alcohol treatment courses.\n\nRod Stewart was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours for services to music. Collecting it in July 2007 at Buckingham Palace, Stewart commented: \"It's a marvellous occasion. We're the only country in the world to honour the common man.\" He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for \"services to music and charity\".\n\nStewart was estimated to have a fortune of £180 million in the \"Sunday Times Rich List\" of 2018, making him one of the 20 wealthiest people in the British music industry.\n\nStewart is known for his liaisons with women and has eight children, by five different mothers:\nIn reference to his divorces, Stewart was once quoted as saying, \"Instead of getting married again, I'm going to find a woman I don't like and just give her a house.\"\n\n\nDuring his career, Rod Stewart has been a member of a number of groups including:\n\nStewart's album and single sales total have been variously estimated as more than 100 million, or at 200 million, in either case earning him a place on the list of best-selling music artists.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It consists of a blouse (襦, \"ru\") and a wrap-around skirt (裙, \"qun; \"also called \"裳, chang\"). It is the eldest type of hanfu which is said to have been worn by the legendary Yellow Emperor, and it is said to be worn by women since the Warring States period.\n\nRuqun is the most basic type of Hanfu. It is said to be the basic clothing up to the 3 Sovereigns and 5 Emperors age. At that time, it was worn by both men and women.\n\nGenerally the blouse was tucked into the skirt. The popularity of \"ruqun\" declined during the Han Dynasty. Although the popularity of women wearing \"ruqun\" increased again during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, most men did not wear it any more. In the Wei Dynasty and Jin Dynasty \"ruqun\" went through a major change when women started to wear much longer upper garments which needed to be put out of the skirt. This new style of ruqun was called \"shanqun (衫裙)\" and existed with \"ruqun.\" During the Sui and Tang Dynasty, the skirts were tied higher and higher up the waist, until they were eventually tied above the breasts, worn with short blouses. In addition to the normal crossed-collar blouses, parallel/straight-collar (對襟) blouses were also worn in this period, thus exposing the cleavage of the breasts. During the Song Dynasty, the skirts were eventually lowered from the breast level back to the normal waistline. In the early Ming Dynasty, \"ruqun\"'s variant, \"shanqun\", went through a major change when women stopped using the sash. This new style of \"ruqun\", also called \"aoqun\" (襖裙), became popular in the late Ming Dynasty.\n\nBy the Ming Dynasty, \"ruqun\" became the most common form of attire for women. The sleeves of the blouse are mostly curved with a narrow sleeve cuff (琵琶袖, \"pipa\" sleeve). The collar is of the same colour as the clothing. Often, there is an optional detachable protective \"huling\" (護領, lit. \"protect collar\") sewn to the collar. The \"huling\" can be white or any dark colour, and is used to protect the collar from being rotten by sweat, therefore to extend the life of the clothing. Towards the start of the Qing Dynasty, the skirt was mostly \"baizhequn\" (百摺裙, lit. \"hundred pleats skirt\") or \"mamianqun\" (馬面裙, lit. \"horse face skirt\").\n\n"}

In 2016, he was director of strategy for the campaign for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nHe previously served as a Member of South Africa's Parliament between 2004 and 2008, as CEO of South Africa's official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance between 2004 and 2009, and as the party's general election campaign chief in 2006, 2009, and 2011. He served as chief adviser to Western Cape Premier Helen Zille between 2009 and 2012.\n\nCoetzee holds a Bachelor of Arts and a Higher Diploma in Education, both from the University of Cape Town.\n\nIn 1997 Coetzee was picked by DP leader Tony Leon to head up the party's parliamentary operations at the age of 24. Leon subsequently noted Coetzee's appointment as \"the most significant\" he made during his 13-year tenure as leader of the party. From 1999, Coetzee was the party's chief strategist, playing a central role in the party's election campaigns, which saw the DA grow from 1.7% in 1994 to 24.2% in the 2011 local government elections.\n\nIn April 2004 Coetzee became a Member of Parliament, and was assigned the shadow health portfolio. Six months later he famously asked then President Thabo Mbeki during a Parliamentary debate whether he believed the high rate of sexual violence in South Africa contributed towards the spread of HIV, and whether the President actually believed HIV causes AIDS. Mbeki responded by accusing Coetzee of succumbing to the \"disease of racism\", but avoided responding directly, thus reigniting criticism of his government's response to the pandemic.\n\nIn 2005, Coetzee was appointed the DA's CEO, in which role he radically reorganised the party and its finances, and designed and managed the 2006 local government election campaign and the 2009 general election campaign. In 2008, he oversaw a relaunch of the party designed to position it as a party of government, and not merely one of opposition.\n\nIn 2009, Coetzee resigned as party CEO to become a Special Advisor to the Premier of the Western Cape and party leader Helen Zille, with a brief to co-ordinate government policy and strategy. He was succeeded as DA CEO by Jonathan Moakes.\n\nIn September 2012, in a surprise move, Nick Clegg appointed Coetzee strategy director of the Liberal Democrats in Britain. In late October 2013 it was announced that Coetzee might return to South Africa and was being offered a Western Cape provincial cabinet post by the DA. However, in August 2014 he instead switched to a job at Liberal Democrat party HQ, becoming the General Election Director of Strategy, for which he was reportedly paid a salary of £110,000.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats faired very badly in the UK 2015 General Election, losing most of their seats. Coetzee is viewed as having led the party into oblivion. Writing for \"The Guardian\" after the result, Coetzee said, \"We got routed by what I call the Fear. We presumed from the beginning that the Conservatives would try to scare voters with the prospect of a Miliband government that would risk the economy. But in the event the polls and the SNP conspired to ratchet up the Fear to Terror levels, because they showed Labour’s only path to power would be via the SNP.\"\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Coetzee joined Britain in Europe, the pro-European referendum campaign organisation. The campaign is seen as lacking in charismatic leadership. As Director of Strategy for the 'Stronger In' campaign, Coetzee was relatively quiet, writing publicly once in a South African newspaper to comment on the 2016 UK budget and difficulties within the UK Conservative Party. In the June 2016 referendum the UK voted to leave the EU, and Ryan Coetzee blamed the defeat in a tweet on \"25 years of right wing tabloid propaganda\".\n\nCoetzee has a son, Daniel Jackson Coetzee, born on 20 October 2006.\n"}

{"id": "52406994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52406994", "title": "She-wolf (Roman mythology)", "text": "She-wolf (Roman mythology)\n\nIn the Roman foundation myth, it was a she-wolf that nursed and sheltered the twins Romulus and Remus after they were abandoned in the wild by order of King Amulius of Alba Longa. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the Lupercal, until they were discovered by a shepherd, Faustulus. Romulus would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of Rome since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.\n\nThere is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy. One legend claims that the Hirpini people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony, they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: \"hirpus\"). The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god Mars the wolf is a sacred animal. There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the Lupercalia.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Apollo's mother Leto is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade Hera.\n\nThe 3 \"canonical\" versions of the myth--those of Livy, Plutarch and Dionysius of Halicarnassus--all draw heavily on Quintus Fabius Pictor. He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins. The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius. Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding. Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of Palatine Hill. The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water. In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal. Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.\n\nDionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further. The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud. The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.\n\nAfter a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the Greek colonists who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god Pan.\n\nLivy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness. The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what. The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land. The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.\n\nThe servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch. After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away. It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.\n\nThe three relay accounts wherein the term \"lupa\" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute. Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment. In one, the twins are fathered by Hercules after he wins a dice game. Their mother is the unwitting \"prize\". In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby Gabii.\n\nThe \"Bolsena Mirror\" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures. Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features. This includes its age. However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340. The famous Capitoline Wolf may be of Etruscan or Old Latin origin. But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and radiocarbon dating has cast doubt on an ancient origin. A stele from Bologna, dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant. By 269 BC, the silver didrachm is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic \"turning of the she-wolf's head\" backward and downward at the twins.\n\nThe distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as Roma, the patron deity of the city, or the Roman eagle. That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity. By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces. She and the twins were featured on the elaborate Ara Pacis, built in honor of Augustus and dedicated to Pax, the goddess of peace.\n\nCoins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated. They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own \"Roman-ness\". They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.\n\nThe Franks Casket, an ornately carved, Anglo-Saxon chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a Runic account of the lupercal. Other Anglo-Saxon artifacts and coins from the same period also feature them. The Byzantines continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in central Asia at sites located in modern Tadjikistan and Uzbekistan along with an 8th-century Sogdian painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.\n\nThe Italian football clubs A.S. Roma and S.S. Robur Siena use the imagery in their respective team logos.\n\nThe Fascist government of Benito Mussolini made use of the she-wolf while in power.\n\nThe Sienese have a traditional tale that the city was founded by Senius and Aschius, another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf. They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus. The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance. However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.\nThe she-wolf and twins appeared on what may have been the earliest silver coin ever minted in Rome.\nThe Lupercalia was a very ancient festival even during Roman times. Roman historians speculated as to its origins. It may be associated with the god Lupercus, the god of shepherds and protector of flocks. Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.\n\n"}

They used to live around the grounds of the zoo in the country's capital city, Kinshasa, and play music which is rooted in soukous, with elements of old-school rhythm and blues and reggae. The core of the band consists of four senior singers/guitarists, who are paraplegic (they had poliomyelitis when they were young) and move around in spectacularly customized tricycles. They are backed by a younger rhythm section consisting of abandoned street children who were taken under the protection of the older members of the band. The soloist is an 18-year-old boy (2009) who plays guitar-like solos on an electrified one-stringed lute he designed and built himself out of a tin can. The group's name translates roughly from Lingala as \"look beyond appearances\".\n\nStaff Benda Bilili earned the 2009 Artist Award at Womex (World Music Expo).\n\nThe group has sought to raise awareness about crimes against humanity in Democratic Republic of the Congo, contributing to the Enough Project and Downtown Records' Raise Hope for Congo compilation. \n\nStaff Benda Bilili was formed by Ricky Likabu and Coco Ngambali with other paraplegic musicians, as other bands in Kinshasa would not work with them. They were later joined by a teenager, Roger Landu, who fashioned his own instrument - named a \"satongé\" - from an empty fish can, a piece of wood and a guitar string. The band rehearsed in Kinshasa zoo, because it was a quiet location, and played the streets of Kinshasa until they were heard by Vincent Kenis, a Belgian record producer specialising in Congolese music, who arranged for the band to record their debut album, \"Tres Tres Fort\" (\"Very Very Strong\").\n\nIn 2006, Staff Benda Bilili's song \"Let's Go and Vote\" (\"Allons Voter\"), written and performed by the musicians, was played repeatedly in the run-up to the 2006 historic polls on radio and television stations; it was reported to be responsible for a 70% increase in voter turnout. The credits on the video clip say it was produced by Monuc UN Mission in DR Congo and distributed by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). The musicians were not offered contracts, but were reportedly paid $50 each. Staff Benda Bilili filed a lawsuit in the Congolese courts seeking $100,000 for Monuc's use of their music.\n\nStaff Benda Bilili were featured in the documentary film \"Jupiter's Dance\", which follows the story of Jupiter Bokondji, a musician who is also involved in Staff Benda Bilili. The film was produced by Renaud Barret and Florent de la Tullaye (aka Belle Kinoise), who have been documenting the band's progress since 2005. They shot several videos, which have become quite popular on the Internet.\n\nBarret and de la Tullaye directed a feature-length documentary on the band, \"Benda Bilili!\" The film was selected by the Quinzaine des Réalisateurs (Directors' Fortnight) at the 2010 edition of the Cannes Film Festival, and premiered on May 13, 2010, with the group in attendance and performing at the opening of the Quinzaine.\n\nEntitled \"Très Très Fort\", the band's debut album was released on Crammed Discs in March 2009. It was produced over the course of three years by Crammed's Vincent Kenis (known for introducing and producing bands such as Konono Nº1, Kasai Allstars, and for the Congotronics series). Kenis recorded the band mostly in the Kinshasa zoo. The album also contains four of Barret & de la Tullaye's videos.\n\nStaff Benda Bilili's \"Très Très Fort\" album was also be released on vinyl by Crammed Discs in 2010, only as part of the limited-edition Congotronics Vinyl Box Set which includes most albums on the Congotronics series. \n\nMedia reactions to \"Très Très Fort\" were excellent, especially in the UK, the US, and France.\n\nStaff Benda Bilili have performed extensively around Europe, Japan and Australia, and were to tour the US for the first time in October 2012. \n\nEntitled \"Bouger Le Monde\" ('Make The World Move'), Staff Benda Bilili's second album was recorded in Kinshasa and mixed in Brussels, again by producer Vincent Kenis. The album comprises 11 new songs and features lead vocals by seven different band members. It was to be released worldwide by Crammed Discs in September 2012.\n\nIn February 2013 \"The Guardian\" reported that singer and songwriter Coco Ngambali had quit, along with fellow vocalist Théo Nzonza, and a tour of top European venues scheduled for March and April had been cancelled amid accusations of mismanagement. The band played some dates in Europe in the autumn of 2013 and summer of 2014. Ngambali and Nzonza now play in Mbongwana Star.\n\n\n"}

Martin was convicted of murder, later reduced to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility, and served three years in prison, having been denied parole. He has since lived at a secret address.\n\nOn 20 August 1999, Tony Martin, a bachelor, was living alone at his farmhouse, Bleak House, in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk which he inherited from his uncle in about 1980. He claimed to have been burgled a total of ten times, losing £6,000 worth of furniture. Police sources say they are not sure that all the incidents took place. Martin also complained about police inaction over the burglaries and claimed that multiple items and furniture were stolen such as dinnerware and a grandfather clock. Martin had equipped himself with an illegally held pump-action Winchester Model 1300 12 gauge shotgun which he claimed to have found. Changes in legislation in 1988, resulting from the Hungerford massacre, had changed the licensing treatment of semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of more than two to equate to that of a firearm, requiring a valid firearms certificate. Martin had his shotgun certificate revoked in 1994 after he found a man stealing apples in his orchard and shot a hole in the back of his vehicle.\n\nOn the evening of 20 August 1999, two burglars – Brendon Fearon, 29, and 16-year-old Fred Barras, both Irish Travellers from Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire – broke into Martin's house. Shooting downwards in the dark with his shotgun loaded with birdshot, Martin shot three times towards the intruders (once when they were in the stairwell and twice more when they were trying to flee through the window of an adjacent ground floor room). Barras was hit in the back and both sustained gunshot injuries to their legs. Both escaped through the window but Barras died at the scene. Martin claimed that he opened fire after being woken when the intruders smashed a window. The prosecution accused him of lying in wait for the burglars and opening fire without warning from close range, in retribution for previous break-ins at his home.\n\nOn 10 January 2000, Fearon and Darren Bark, 33 (who had acted as the getaway driver), both from Newark-on-Trent, admitted to conspiring to burgle Martin's farmhouse. Fearon was sentenced to 36 months in prison, and Bark to 30 months (with an additional 12 months arising from previous offences). Fearon was released on 10 August 2001. Fred Barras, the dead youth, had already been convicted of a total of 29 offences by the time of his death at the age of 16, including seven convictions for theft and six for fraud. He had been sentenced to two months in a young offenders' institution for assaulting a policeman, theft and being drunk and disorderly. On the night he was killed, Barras had just been released on bail after being accused of stealing garden furniture. His elderly grandmother, Mary Dolan, stated: \"It's not fair that the farmer has got all the money and he is the one that took Fred away.\"\n\nOn 23 August 1999, Martin was charged with the murder of Barras, the attempted murder of Fearon, \"wounding with intent to cause injury\" to Fearon and \"possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life\". Martin did not hold a valid shotgun certificate (licence), let alone the more restrictive Firearms Certificate he would have needed to possess the Winchester pump-action shotgun that held a maximum of five rounds.\n\nEnglish law permits a person to kill another in self-defence only if the person defending him or herself uses no more than \"reasonable force\"; it is the responsibility of the jury to determine whether or not an unreasonable amount of force was used. The jury at the trial were told that they had the option of returning a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder, if they thought that Martin \"did not intend to kill or cause serious bodily harm\". However, the jurors found Martin guilty of murder by a 10 to 2 majority.\n\nHe was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommended minimum term to serve of 9 years, reduced to 8 years by the Lord Chief Justice.\n\nAn appeal was considered in October 2001 by three senior judges headed by Lord Woolf LCJ. Submissions by the defence that Martin had fired in his own defence were rejected by the appeal court. On this occasion, the defence also submitted evidence that Martin was diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder exacerbated by depression and that his paranoia was specifically directed at anyone intruding into his home; he was also diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. This submission was accepted by the Court of Appeal and, on the grounds of diminished responsibility, Martin's murder conviction was replaced by manslaughter carrying a five-year sentence, and his ten-year sentence for wounding Fearon was reduced to three years. These sentences were to run concurrently.\n\nMartin was imprisoned in Highpoint Prison at Stradishall in Suffolk. When he became eligible for parole and early release in January 2003, the Parole Board rejected his application without stating a reason. The chairman of the parole board, Sir David Hatch, in an interview with \"The Times\" described Martin as \"a very dangerous man\" who might still believe his action had been right.\n\nMartin challenged the decision in the High Court, where the parole board's decision was upheld. Probation officers on Martin's cases said there was an \"unacceptable risk\" that Martin might again react with excessive force if other would-be burglars intruded on his Norfolk farm. On 28 July 2003, Martin was released after serving three years of his five-year sentence, the maximum period for which he could be held following good behaviour.\n\nDuring 2003, Fearon applied for, and received, an estimated £5,000 of legal aid to sue Martin for loss of earnings due to the injuries he had sustained. However, the case was thrown into doubt when photographs were published in \"The Sun\", showing him \"cycling and climbing with little apparent difficulty\" suggesting that Fearon's injuries were not as serious as had been claimed. While the case was pending, Fearon was recalled to jail after being charged with the theft of a vehicle while on probation on a conviction for dealing heroin. Fearon later dropped the case when Martin agreed to drop a counter-claim. \n\nNick Makin, Martin's solicitor, said: \"It is appalling that the family of someone who has a criminal record for burglary and assault should attempt to claim any damages of criminal injury when he was shot while burgling the dwelling of an innocent person... It is also appalling that they may get legal aid while his victim is in prison and patently unable to work and equally cannot get legal aid... There is something wrong and perverse with our legal system that it permits this.\"\n\nThe BBC reported in 2003 that Fearon's supporters put a bounty on Martin's head of several tens of thousands of pounds. In July 2003, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that a cousin of Barras had said that a £60,000 bounty had been put on Martin's head.\n\nIn October 2003, the \"Daily Mirror\" paid Martin £125,000 for an exclusive interview on his release from prison. After investigation, the Press Complaints Commission ruled that the payment was justified and in the public interest because Martin \"had a unique insight into an issue of great public concern\".\n\nSince his release Martin has appeared on the platform of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and was the guest-of-honour at the Traditional Britain Group's Annual Dinner at Simpson's-in-the-Strand in London on 7 November 2003. Martin said himself that he had attended meetings of the National Front in Norfolk, and later went on to endorse the British National Party. One of Martin's uncles by marriage, Andrew Fountaine, was a founder member of the National Front.\n\nIn August 2014, it was revealed that Martin's house had been boarded up since his imprisonment and he had subsequently lived both with friends and in his car.\n\nOn 31 December 2015, the media reported that Martin had been arrested on suspicion of possessing an illegal firearm. Martin was not charged.\n\n\n\n"}
