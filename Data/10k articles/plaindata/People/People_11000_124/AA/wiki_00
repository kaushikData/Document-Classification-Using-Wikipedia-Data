He shot to fame with the film \"Dev.D\" with the song \"Emotional Attyachar\" turning an instant hit.He also lent his voice to this song with Amit Trivedi. He has been continuously writing lyrics for a variety of Bollywood movies since then and has also sung a few of them. Bhattacharya has also maintained a close association with Amit Trivedi since their first film \"Aamir\". He has written the lyrics or sang for most of the film albums composed by the latter. His lyrics have been variously described as \"frillfree\" and \"smartly worded\".\n\nA National Award-winning lyricist, he has won the National Award for the song \"Agar Zindagi\" from the film \"I Am\". He won his first Filmfare award for the song \"Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin\". In his song-writing career he has won highest number of awards, precisely 9, for the song \"Channa Mereya\" to date.\n\nHe has been acclaimed for writing \"good lyrics\" and poetry.\n\nSome of his written songs are \"Channa Mereya\", \"Ae Dil Hai Mushkil\", \"Kabira\", \"Mast Magan\", \"Raabta\", \"Zehnaseeb\", \"Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin\", \"Naina\", \"Manja\", \"Janam Janam\" , \"Zinda Hoon\", \"Gerua\", \"Zaalima\", \"Sapna Jahan\" and \" |sweetheart|| Namo Namo\".\n\nHe completed his schooling from Spring Dale College, Indira Nagar, Lucknow in 1995 and completed his Graduation from Lucknow University in 1999 before venturing out to Mumbai for becoming a singer.\n\nIn a prolific interview given to the \"Times of India\" in 2013, Bhattacharya said that he migrated to Mumbai from Lucknow harbouring dreams of becoming a singer fourteen years ago (1999). He stood in the long queues in front of music composers' office and gave them demo \"Audio Cassettes\" to listen to him. But it didn't bear any fruit.\n\nHe went up to music composer & director Pritam Chakraborty. It was Pritam who gave him work and allowed him to assist.\n\nDuring his struggling days, he started writing lyrics for Advertisement jingles to lower his frustration of not getting work. He learned the art of song-writing during those struggling days.\n\nIn the year 2004, when his friend Amartya Rahut introduced him to music composer Amit Trivedi, Trivedi and Rahut, who often composed music for television channels, took Bhattacharya as a dummy singer to give presentations of his music. Trivedi also urged him to write rough lyrics. While writing lyrics, Bhattacharya discovered that he had an innate talent of giving words to tunes. Over the years, Trivedi and Bhattacharya became good friends.\n\nHis major breakthrough came when Trivedi was working upon the music of Anurag Kashyap's Dev.D, Trivedi insisted Bhattacharya to write rough lyrics. Bhattacharya wrote the lyrics for the songs of Dev.D, and most of its major songs became a hit, thus nearly ending 8 years of his struggle for recognition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36131262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36131262", "title": "André Burthe", "text": "André Burthe\n\nAndré Burthe d'Annelet de Rosenthal (1772–1830) was a Baron of France.\n\nAndré Burthe was born in Metz in France on 8 December 1772, allegedly into a family of Irish refugees who had followed James II of England to France. However his father Nicolas Burthe was a descendent of a line of merchants in Metz, so it is unclear where this allegation arises. His father married Françoise d'Annelet in the parish of St Eucaire in Metz on 29 October 1771: according to Laussat Nicolas was an ex-soldier who had joined a manufacturing enterprise in Metz, and the young André studied under a parish priest in Lorraine. He entered military service on 6 April 1791 at the age of 19 as a simple cavalier in the Second Regiment of Dragoons, after which his career had a meteoric rise. He served in the Armée du Nord 1792-4 during the French Revolution.\n\nBurthe fought with distinction at the Battle of Neerwinden (1793), after which he was made provisional second lieutenant of the 10th Regiment of Dragoons on 13 April 1793. This appointment was confirmed in May of that year and he took part in three campaigns at that grade; in 1794 he was wounded in combat.\n\nHe served in the Armée du Rhin 1794-95 and entered the General Staff as an adjutant general to Solignac in the Armée d'Italie in February 1796. In 1797 he was promoted to capitaine d’Etat-major to the army in Italy and in October the following year became first aide de camp to André Masséna in the Armée d'Helvétie. He took part in the campaign in the Helvetic Republic and was promoted to Chef d'Escadron in the field at the First Battle of Zurich in 1799. He was seriously wounded twice by musket balls at the Siege of Genoa (1800).\n\nMasséna, recognising the young man’s merit, honoured him with a particular friendship and charged him once he was recovered with the formal presentation of the Italian enemy flags captured at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800 to the new First Consul of France (Napoleon Bonaparte, following a coup the previous year). The General raised him to the rank of adjutant-general, a promotion confirmed on 14 July 1800, when the presentation took place at a public display on the Champ de Mars in Paris: an address was made by Lannes and Burthe also made a speech.\n\nHe joined the Armée de Batavie in October and served in Holland and Hanover from 1801. He was named Chief of Staff of the troops in Holland commanded by General Victor, and followed him with the same rank in the Louisiana Expedition.\n\nBurthe accompanied the Prefect Pierre Clément de Laussat (1756–1835) to New Orleans in 1803. Laussat was a diplomat and administrator sent by Napoleon Bonaparte to New Orleans to oversee the transfer of Louisiana (which had been Spanish since the 1760s) from Spain to France (and, as it turned out, the subsequent sale to the United States). The papers of the Laussat collection relate to the retrocession of Louisiana from Spain to France by the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso and the transfer of the territory to the United States under the Louisiana Purchase. Before Laussat left France, he had started to gather data and pertinent information on the colony of Louisiana, and these materials, together with his correspondence, formed the core of his official file which he later brought back with him to France. Laussat gathered documents generated by the Spanish colonial administration, which included royal decrees and implementing orders, regulations on local government, and official reports. His collected papers also include a Decree ordering the arrest of Adjutant Commandant André Burthe, and an Order of Manuel María de Salcedo and the Marqués de Casa Calvo, commissioners of Spain, New Orleans, to Adjutant Commandant André Burthe, New Orleans.\n\nIn his memoirs, Laussat records his version of the history of the very public animosity between him and Burthe, which appears to have begun even before the party left France. General Victor commissioned Burthe to accompany Laussat, a civilian travelling with his wife and daughters, in an advance party to arrive ahead of the troops of the main Louisiana expedition. It appears that Burthe’s view was that as a member of the military, he should take command of the personnel of the troops while leaving Laussat charge of the supplies and equipment, an idea which Laussat opposed vehemently, seeing himself as in charge of the entire expedition. Laussat initially succeeded in having Burthe dropped from the expedition, but he was reinstated through the intervention of General Victor and joined the company's ship at Rochefort. According to Laussat, Burthe had neither passport nor formal permission to board the ship, and depended on the offices of Laussat himself to ensure he was able to travel. Laussat describes Burthe as having a character marked by conceit and irascibility; although he was not lacking in intelligence, his mind was disorderly and full of revolutionary ideas involving military despotism. However, as Laussat himself was a difficult character who was not well liked by many of his peers, his opinions should be viewed with a degree of objectivity.\n\nLaussat reports that Burthe avoided accompanying him in any formal contact with Admiral Martin, the naval prefect at Rochefort, or with the Spanish commander. It does seem, however, that Burthe made his own separate visits to both, presenting letters from General Victor, and giving the impression that he had secret orders of his own which he did not share with the Prefect. \nMeanwhile, New Orleans was surprised by the receipt of the momentous news that Louisiana was to be transferred from Spain to French rule. Preparations were made to quarter the large party of French officers who were expected to arrive in the colony, but on 21 March 1803 local officials saw the arrival of a single ship, the French corvette \"Surveillant\", with on board just Laussat, his family, a small suite of officers and civilian associates, and of course adjutant-general Burthe, who was expected to attach himself to General Victor's staff when that commander should eventually arrive.\n\nLaussat bore a commission as Colonial Prefect. In the government to be established in Louisiana this official was to have powers similar to, but more extensive than, those previously enjoyed by the ruling Spanish Intendant. The remaining officials were to be a Captain-General whose functions paralleled those of the Spanish Governor-General, and a Commissary of Justice set up to superintend the administration of justice and compile a civil and criminal code. In the end, Laussat was the only one of these officials to arrive: Victor, who was appointed Captain-General and Commissioner to receive the Province from the Spanish on the behalf of France, never reached Louisiana.\n\nAs early as April 1803 Laussat reported to his government that he was beginning to find his position difficult. It does appear that, as a result of his own personality as much as the force of circumstances, he managed to alienate all parties, even the most rabid Republicans. The Royalists and émigrés saw in him merely the agent of a hated government. His relations with the official classes also gradually grew unpleasant. Laussat attributed this to the influence of the Marquès de Casa Calvo, who arrived in May as the Spanish Commissioner for the transfer of the Province. The power struggle between Burthe and Laussat begun on the voyage from France escalated, representing the rivalry between military and civilian authority. Each refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the other, and the Spanish Governor Salcedo openly received Burthe as if he were a representative of the French government, and allowing him to inspect barracks and hospitals, an action guaranteed to alienate Laussat still further. The animosity between the two Frenchmen became increasingly public, with both parties indulging in disgraceful behaviour, including deliberately organising rival dinner parties and competing for prominent guests. Matters came to a head when both men invited the official Vinache to dinner on 14 July 1803; when Vinache only gave conditional acceptance of Burthe's invitation, Laussat claims that Burthe attempted to place Vinache under arrest. Vinache complained of this to Laussat, with the result that Laussat informed Casa Calvo that he was issuing a warrant demanding Burthe’s arrest and return to France. (This warrant survives in the collection of Laussat's published papers.) However the Spaniard would not recognize Laussat's rights to make such a demand: he took the ground that, until the Province was actually transferred to France, Spanish authority prevailed.\n\nAfter this, Laussat publicly snubbed Burthe and flounced out of a formal dinner given by Casa Calvo on 14 October 1803 on discovering that Burthe was also present, announcing that it was not possible for the two of them to be in the same room. The following week, Laussat claims that he refused to pay the officer’s salary, telling him to refer the matter back directly to the First Consul. Fortunately for Burthe, by this time he had met the 15-year-old heiress Marguerite-Suzanne Delord-Sarpy (1788–1863), daughter of a wealthy widow and prominent family of the town. (She was granddaughter of Pierre Antoine Foucher de Circé and older sister of Louise Delord Sarpy, who married André's younger cousin Dominique François Burthe, who had also travelled to Louisiana as part of the advance party.)\n\nThe couple were married on 23 July 1803 by the hospital chaplain under a special dispensation.\n\nIn the event, Louisiana was French for just three weeks (30 November–20 December 1803) as the area became an American territory on 20 December. When they had set out from France to reclaim Louisiana, the Frenchmen had had no way of knowing that Napoleon would sell Louisiana to the United States in April and that France would govern the province for just that three-week interregnum.\n\nAndré and Suzanne left the colony soon after these events, having secretly booked passage for New York on the American ship \"Pastley\", which they joined on 18 January 1804, and thence sailed to France. Burthe's parting shot was to leave a pamphlet \"Burthe contre Laussat\" (publication date 1 January 1804), written in French, which bore the epigraph from Juvenal ‘Facit indignatio versum’ [Indignation makes the verse] and set out Burthe’s interpretation of Laussat’s conduct. In response, on 11 April 1804 Laussat’s supporter Jean-Paul Blanque published a reply (in French), \"En opposition à Burthe contre Laussat\".\n\nBurthe returned to Paris with his new wife to pursue his military career. He was promoted to Colonel of 4th Regiment of Hussars on 1 February 1805 and Suzanne, contrary to the reputation of Creole women for being modest and domestic, gaining notoriety by donning military uniform and accompanying her husband on his campaigns.\n\nIn December 1805 Burthe led his regiment at the Battle of Austerlitz as part of the Light Cavalry Division under Kellerman. Suzanne followed him to the battlefield and was reputed to be by the side of the Emperor when night fell. In December 1806 Burthe was made Commandeur de la Légion d’Honneur in recognition of his valour. He took part in the campaigns in Prussia and Poland: despite having been wounded at Liebstadt in January, he fought at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807, leading three squadrons of the 4th Hussars. He followed the Brigade to Spain in September 1808 and was made 1e Baron d’Annelet et de l’Empire on 5 October.\n\nBurthe continued to distinguish himself at the Siege of Zaragoza (1809). When Burthe was appointed Général de Cavalerie, his wife became a member of his staff and was known as ‘Monsieur d’Annelet’. She had remained with her husband through his posting to Spain until he arrived at Bayonne, at which point she saw the wisdom of returning to Paris to become a glittering member of society and take care of her growing family. Meanwhile, André took part in the campaign in Aragon at the Siege of Lérida (1810) and was further promoted to Général de Brigade on 30 December 1810.\n\nIn December 1811 Burthe was made head of the 8th Brigade of the Second Division of Light Cavalry (Wathier St Alphonse), and served with the Division during the campaign of 1812. He was injured in Moscow in September and taken prisoner by the Russians in November, and was not released until July 1814. He took up arms again in 1815 during the Hundred Days, and led the 1st Brigade of the 9th Cavalry Division at the Battle of Waterloo, fighting against the English. On the Bourbon Restoration Burthe retired from military service; on 6 January 1825 he was granted a pension of 4,000 francs.\n\nIn 1812 the couple purchased the domaine de la Roche-du-Parc in Noisy-le-Grand (now the site of the Hôtel de Ville of Noisy-le-Grand: the original farm was demolished in 1864 and replaced by the chateau which survives today) as well as part of the nearby Bois Saint-Martin. Four of their ten children were born in the new family home. André and Suzanne became involved in the local community: the baron was named municipal councillor by the Prefecture from 1817 to 1819, and his wife was awarded the title of 'la Mère des pauvres' by the Conseil municipal. The Burthes sold the property in Noisy-le-Grand to the Buissons, a Creole family, in 1827 and appear to have lived out their final years in the city of Paris.\n\nAndré Burthe d’Annelet died on 2 April 1830 at the Rue St Lazare in Paris, leaving his wife and 8 surviving children. He is buried at the Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris (28th division Square of Maréchaux). His wife died in 1863 and is buried next to him: her tomb inscription records that she was awarded the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène, participated in the campaigns of 1805-1808 and accompanied her husband to Iéna and Auerstedt. Also buried there are Jules Félix Burthe (1804–1837), officier de cavalerie, Octavie Burthe (1825–1839) and André Adolphe Burthe (1808–1846), capitaine de cavalerie.\n\nBurthe's name appears on the 8th column of the north pillar of the Arc de Triomphe. His bust is also exhibited at the Musée de l'Armée aux Invalides. The title Baron Burthe d'Annelet was inherited by his son Jules-Félix (1804–1857), who died childless, and subsequently by André's fifth son Charles-François. The family continued to maintain residences at the Rue d'Aumale in Paris and Rosenthal until the 1930s.\n"}

They became famous for developing a controversial treatment using Lorenzo's oil, for their son's incurable illness, and this quest was recounted in the film \"Lorenzo's Oil\" (1992). Augusto had previously been an economist for the World Bank.\n\nIn recognition of the parents' work, Augusto Odone received an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling. He continued to raise funds and drive the scientific task force known as \"The Myelin Project\" until his death. Michaela Odone battled cancer for some time and died of lung cancer on June 10, 2000, at the age of 61.\n\nLorenzo died the day after his 30th birthday. He was almost totally paralyzed but was, according to his father Augusto, \"holding his own\". He was unable to speak or move on his own. He communicated by wiggling his fingers and blinking his eyes. His mind was intact and he enjoyed music and having people read to him. \"Certainly, he has good days and bad days, he is bedridden and he cannot eat more than through a tube… but his mind is still there. He likes that we read to him, that we play music for him and he knows who is around him\". He lived with his father in Virginia and was cared for by nurses and his family friend, Oumouri Hassane.\n\nIn mid-2010, two years after Lorenzo's death, Augusto Odone sold his home in Virginia and moved to Acqui Terme in his native Italy, near his father's village of Gamalero where he lived when he was young. He died there on 24 October 2013, at the age of 80, and was survived by the son and daughter from his first marriage, as well as a grandchild by his daughter Cristina Odone.\n\nThis severe form of adrenoleukodystrophy was first described by Ernst Siemerling and Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt in 1923. Lorenzo was diagnosed in 1984, using a new blood test that had been recently developed. At the time, people diagnosed with the disease were usually young boys between 5 and 10 years old, who would gradually become mute, deaf, blind and paralysed before dying, which typically happened within two years due to aspiration or neurological causes.\n\nAugusto and Michaela refused to accept this grim prognosis, and fought to find a treatment for their son's fatal disease, clashing time after time with doctors, specialists, and support groups, some of whom were skeptical that two average citizens could produce a cure. With the help of Hugo Moser, and through long hours of research and study, the Odones, who had had no previous medical background, came up with a treatment. This treatment involved the consumption of a specially prepared oil, which became known as \"Lorenzo's oil\". Patients suffering from a related condition, adrenomyeloneuropathy, showed no clinical improvement after being treated with Lorenzo's Oil.\n\nThe Odones had an important role both in developing Lorenzo's oil and in setting up The Myelin Project, which promotes and carries out research on ALD and other similar disorders. Michaela also insisted on continuing to treat her incapacitated son as a human being and not a \"vegetable\", helping him devise a means of communicating with her and others through the blinking of his eyes and the wiggling of his fingers.\n\nThe Odones' story was first depicted in the 1990 Italian television film \"Voglia di vivere\", starring Tomas Milian and Dominique Sanda. It was later made into the 1992 film \"Lorenzo's Oil\", in which Augusto was played by Nick Nolte and Michaela by Susan Sarandon, who through her involvement with the movie, became the spokesperson of the Myelin Project.\n\nThe 1994 episode of \"The Critic\" entitled \"Dr. Jay\", in which the main character Jay Sherman works to discover a cure for his boss' terminal disease was a send-up of the story.\n\nA poem Michaela wrote about Lorenzo was set to music by Phil Collins. Titled \"Lorenzo\", it was featured on his 1996 album \"Dance into the Light\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3963", "title": "Beachcomber (pen name)", "text": "Beachcomber (pen name)\n\nBeachcomber is a \"nom de plume\" that has been used by several journalists writing a long-running humorous column on the \"Daily Express\". It was originated in 1919 by Major John Bernard Arbuthnot MVO as his signature on the column, titled ‘By the Way’. The name Beachcomber was then passed to D. B. Wyndham Lewis and, in turn, to J.B. Morton, who wrote the column till 1975. It was later revived by William Hartston, current author of the column.\n\n\"By the Way\" was originally a column in \"The Globe\", consisting of unsigned humorous pieces; P. G. Wodehouse was assistant editor of the column from August 1903 and editor from August 1904 to May 1909, during which time he was assisted by Herbert Westbrook. After the \"Globe\"'s closure, it was reestablished as a society news column in the \"Daily Express\" from 1917 onwards, initially written by social correspondent Major John Arbuthnot, who invented the name \"Beachcomber\".\n\nAfter Arbuthnot was promoted to deputy editor, it was taken over sometime in 1919 by Wyndham-Lewis, who reinvented it as an outlet for his wit and humour. It was then passed to Morton during 1924, though it is likely there was a period when they overlapped. Morton wrote the column until 1975; it was revived in January 1996 and continues today, written by William Hartston. The column is unsigned except by \"Beachcomber\" and it was not publicly known that Morton or Wyndham-Lewis wrote it until the 1930s. The name is mainly associated with Morton, who has been credited as an influence by Spike Milligan amongst others. Morton introduced the recurring characters and continuing stories that were a major feature of the column during his 51-year run.\n\nThe format of the column was a random assortment of small paragraphs which were otherwise unconnected. These could be anything, such as:\n\n\nMorton's other interest, France, was occasionally represented by epic tales of his rambling walks through the French countryside. These were not intended as humour.\n\n\"By the Way\" was popular with the readership, and of course, one of the reasons it lasted so long. Its style and randomness could be off-putting, however, and it is safe to say the humour could be something of an acquired taste. Oddly, one of the column's greatest opponents was the \"Express\" newspaper's owner, Lord Beaverbrook, who had to keep being assured the column was indeed funny. A prominent critic was George Orwell, who frequently referred to him in his essays and diaries as \"A Catholic Apologist\" and accused him of being \"silly-clever\", in line with his criticisms of G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, Ronald Knox and Wyndham-Lewis. \n\nBut \"By the Way\" was one of the few features kept continuously running in the often seriously reduced \"Daily Express\" throughout World War II, when Morton's lampooning of Hitler, including the British invention of bracerot to make the Nazi's trousers fall down at inopportune moments, was regarded as valuable for morale.\n\nThe column appeared daily until 1965 when it was changed to weekly. It was cancelled in 1975 and revived as a daily piece in the early 1990s. It continues to the present day in much the same format, but is now entitled \"Beachcomber\", not \"By the Way\".\n\n\nThe Will Hay film \"Boys Will Be Boys\" (1935) was set at Morton's Narkover school.\n\nAccording to Spike Milligan, the columns had been an influence on the comedic style of his radio series, \"The Goon Show\". \n\nIn 1969, Milligan based a BBC television series named \"The World of Beachcomber\" on the columns. A small selection was issued on a 1971 LP and a 2-cassette set of the series' soundtrack was made available in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1989, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the first of three series based on Morton's work. This featured Richard Ingrams as Beachcomber, John Wells as Prodnose, Patricia Routledge and John Sessions. The compilations prepared by Mike Barfield. Series 1 was also made available as a 2-cassette set.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16824962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16824962", "title": "Berlusconi II Cabinet", "text": "Berlusconi II Cabinet\n\nThe Berlusconi II Cabinet was the 57th cabinet of the Italian Republic, and the first cabinet of the XIV Legislature. It took office following the 2001 elections, and held office from 11 June 2001 until 23 April 2005, a total of 1,412 days, or 3 years, 10 months and 12 days. It held office for the longest period in the history of the Republic, and for the second longest period in the history of unified Italy since 1861 (outlasted only by the Mussolini government). During its long tenure, its composition changed significantly. Following the poor performance of the centrist parties in the Italian regional elections of 2005, most of the ministers of the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats and the Socialist Party - New PSI resigned from the government, which was succeeded by the Berlusconi III Cabinet.\n\nIn 2001 Berlusconi again ran as leader of the centre-right coalition House of Freedoms (), which included the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, the Northern League, the National Alliance and other parties. Berlusconi's success in the May 2001 general election led to him becoming Prime Minister once more, with the coalition receiving 45.4% of the vote for the Chamber of Deputies and 42.5% for the Senate.\n\nOn the television interviews programme \"Porta a Porta\", during the last days of the electoral campaign, Berlusconi created a powerful impression on the public by undertaking to sign a so-called \"Contratto con gli Italiani\" (), an idea copied outright by his advisor Luigi Crespi from the Newt Gingrich's Contract with America introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election, which was widely considered to be a creative masterstroke in his 2001 campaign bid for prime ministership. In this solemn agreement, Berlusconi claimed his commitment on improving several aspects of the Italian economy and life. Firstly, he undertook to simplify the complex tax system by introducing just two tax rates (33% for those earning over 100,000 euros, and 23% for anyone earning less than that figure: anyone earning less than 11,000 euros a year would not be taxed); secondly, he promised to halve the unemployment rate; thirdly, he undertook to finance and develop a massive new public works programme. Fourthly, he promised to raise the minimum monthly pension rate to 516 euros; and fifthly, he would suppress the crime wave by introducing police officers to patrol all local zones and areas in Italy's major cities. Berlusconi undertook to refrain from putting himself up for re-election in 2006 if he failed to honour at least four of these five promises.\n\nThe government obtained the confidence of the senate on 20 June 2001 with 175 votes in favour, 133 against and 5 abstentions, and the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies on 21 June 2001 with 351 votes in favour, 261 against and 1 abstention.\n\nOpposition parties claim Berlusconi was not able to achieve the goals he promised in his \"Contratto con gli Italiani\". Some of his partners in government, especially the National Alliance and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats have admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself has consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, and said his Government provided \"un miracolo continuo\" (a continuous miracle) that made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognize these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in the printed media, asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him. Luca Ricolfi, an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to maintain only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension levels. The other four promises were not, in Luca Ricolfi’s view, honoured. In particular, the undertakings on the tax simplification and the reduction of crime.\n\nHouse of Freedoms did not do as well in the 2003 local elections as it did in the 2001 national elections. In common with many other European governing groups, in the 2004 elections of the European Parliament, gaining 43.37% support. Forza Italia's support was also reduced from 29.5% to 21.0% (in the 1999 European elections Forza Italia had 25.2%). As an outcome of these results the other coalition parties, whose electoral results were more satisfactory, asked Berlusconi and Forza Italia for greater influence in the government's political line.\n\nIn the 2005 regional elections (3 April/4 April 2005), the centre-left gubernatorial candidates won in 12 out of 14 regions where control of local governments and governorships was at stake. Berlusconi's coalition kept only two of the regional bodies (Lombardy and Veneto) up for re-election. Three parties, Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, National Alliance and Socialist Party - New PSI, threatened to withdraw from the Berlusconi government. The Italian Premier, after some hesitation, then presented to the President of the Republic a request for the dissolution of his government on 20 April 2005.\n\n"}

She specializes in Cabernet Sauvignon. Corison was the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" Winemaker of the Year in 2011.\n\nCathy Corison grew up in Riverside, California. She studied biology at Pomona College and was on their men's diving team, because the school didn't have a women's team. In 1972, she had to take an extracurricular class. Using her diving skills she decided to sign up for a trampoline class, but changed her mind upon seeing a sign-up sheet for a wine tasting class. This class was the catalyst for garnering Corison's interest in winemaking. After graduation in 1975, she moved to Napa Valley in California. She received her Master's degree in Enology from University of California, Davis.\n\nUpon moving to Napa, she started working in the tasting room at Sterling Vineyards and at a wine shop. During this time, she was getting her Master's degree at the University of California, Davis. She was told by her professor that she would not get a job in Napa Valley because of being a woman. She tried to get a job at Freemark Abbey and was denied the job. Part of the reasons the owners gave was because she was too short and they believed she could not work in the wine cellar. She almost started working at Christian Brothers in the enology lab. \n\nAs part of a larger pattern of sexism in the wine industry at the time, many women worked in labs and weren't allowed to be winemakers. Corison decided against working in the lab and in 1978 she became an intern at Freemark Abbey. She eventually became a winemaker for the winery. She then joined Chappellet Winery, in 1983, as head winemaker, working there for almost ten years. At Chappellet she was able to focus on developing her skills at creating Cabernet Sauvignon wines. She dislikes wines with high alcohol content and fruit forward wines. She does not add additives of acids to her wine.\n\nShe founded her own winery, Corison Winery, in 1987. The winery is located in St. Helena, California in a barn built by Corison's husband, William Martin. Corison Winery makes Cabernet and Gewürztraminer wines and produces 3,500 cases a year. The winery makes a Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon and a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. The Kronos is an estate wine and made from organic grapes. The vineyard is dry farmed. The grapes come from one of the oldest vineyards in Napa Valley. The Napa Valley Cabernet comes from Rutherford. The Gewürztraminer is called Corazón and comes from the Anderson Valley AVA.\n\n\n"}

He is the older brother of fashion designer Jenny Packham.\n\nHe found his time at school very difficult, being socially excluded and regularly bullied by fellow pupils. In his teenage years, he was responsible for the care of a kestrel, which he took from the wild and the death of which was a severe low point in his life. At university, he embraced the punk rock scene.\n\nPackham has had Ménière's disease since his late 30s. In 2003, at the age of 42, Packham began seeing a therapist after the death of his dog, Fish.

For over ten years Packham has been in a relationship with Charlotte Corney, owner of the Isle of Wight Zoo, although the couple live separately.\n\nIn 2009, during an interview with the \"Radio Times\", Packham suggested that the giant panda was too expensive to save and \"should be allowed to become extinct\" so that funds could be redistributed to protecting other animals and habitats. He made a comment in 2008 saying he would \"eat the last panda\" if doing so would retroactively redistribute the money spent on panda conservation. He later apologised for upsetting people.\n\nIn 2009, 2014 and 2017, he criticised the TV show \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\" for its mistreatment of animals.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2010, Packham said that \"The human population is sowing the seeds of a mass extinction event.\" In 2012, he expressed this view again in the \"Daily Mirror\" and reiterated this in 2017 saying that if every woman could be emancipated, birth rates would drop.\n\nIn 2014, he self-funded a film crew to produce a series to highlight the mass killing of migrating birds by hunters in Malta. In April 2017, he was arrested and charged with assault while filming on the Maltese island of Gozo. The case was dismissed after video footage evidence was revealed.\n\nIn 2015, Packham signed a letter to MPs to block the proposed changes to amend the Hunting Act 2004. He has worked to raise awareness of the illegal persecution of raptors in the UK. He resigned as President of the Hawk and Owl Trust in 2015 citing \"Personal differences over ideas of policy\". Later in 2015 Packham wrote an article in \"BBC Wildlife\" magazine complaining about the silence of many of Britain's leading conservation organisations on the issues of fox hunting, badger culling and hen harrier persecution. This elicited a public response from the Countryside Alliance calling for the BBC to sack him. Packham has been accused by the fieldsports community of exploiting his position as a very frequent presenter on the BBC to publicise his anti-shooting views; the BBC maintains that he is not employed by them, so is not bound by their impartiality rules. The BBC has required him to attend regular reviews to ensure that his behaviour is appropriate, but the Corporation refuses to release any information about the content or outcome of these reviews.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was awarded €100,000 by the Regional Court of Cologne.\n\nVölling was born in 1959 with XX sex chromosomes, typically associated with being female, and likely also with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. She had ambiguous genitalia and was assigned and raised male. She had an early puberty with what was considered to be striking physical growth, including beard growth.\n\nDuring an appendectomy, at age 14, the teenager was found to have a full set of female reproductive organs, including ovaries and fallopian tubes. While no testicular tissue was detected, Völling was diagnosed as having a mix of both male and female organs. She was informed of the presence of female organs and told she was 60% female. Völling suffered mental health issues as a consequence. Her female-typical chromosomal pattern was detected in 1977, but the results were not shared with her. Her awareness of her sexuality and her sexual orientation were analysed, followed by surgery at age 18 on 12 August 1977 that removed her female sexual organs, including her reproductive organs. Medical papers showed purpose of the surgery as a \"testovarectomy\", the removal of both testicular and ovarian tissue, however, no testicular tissue was present. The senior physician’s entry stated “a normal female anatomy with pre-pubertal uterus, normal sized ovaries, blindly ending vagina...” were found.\n\nVölling continued to live as a man for a time, but later transitioned to live as a woman. In 2006, Völling obtained her medical records and discovered the concealment of her chromosomal diagnosis, and the nature of the surgery in 1977.\n\nIn a case decided on 6 February 2008, in the Regional Court of Cologne, Völling stated that she had been unable to consent to, or fully understand, the nature of the surgery that took place in 1977. She argued that, with appropriate medical treatment, she could have lived the life of a woman, including full female sexuality and the ability to procreate. In addition to life in an inappropriate gender, she suffered the consequences of castration, and of a urethra reconstruction, including persistent urinary tract infections and urinary dysfunction.\n\nThe surgeon argued that he relied on the diagnostic support of medical specialists. He further argued that Völling did not possess a \"naturally female body\", but one subjected to virilization, and \"profoundly atrophied\" sex organs.\" In the surgeon's view, the surgery fulfilled the urgent and thoroughly reviewed wishes of the patient. Key diagnostic information was withheld for therapeutic reasons, primarily due to concern about her mental health.\n\nThe court determined that the surgery took place in the absence of any grave or acute health risks. The doctor had no good reason for failing to provide full diagnostic information, in particular as the diagnostic data showed that Völling did not possess mixed sex characteristics, with the potential to maintain one present sex, but actually involved the complete removal of her only present sex organs. Völling was both genetically and physically female. An obligation to inform the patient about her diagnoses could not be disregarded for therapeutic reasons as the \"surgery's point of origin considerably changed during the surgery\".\n\nThe court ruled that \"the Defendant illegally, in a deliberate and culpable manner, injured the Plaintiff’s health by removing his female sex organs\" without full consent about the nature, content and extent of the surgery. Völling was awarded costs of €100,000.\n\nThe International Commission of Jurists describe the case as \"an example of an individual who was subjected to sex reassignment surgery without full knowledge or consent\". The case fell just within limits afforded by the statute of limitations.\n\nIn addition to the reparations case, Völling had to petition a court for her official change of name and change of legal status from male to female.\n\n"}
{"id": "5222135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5222135", "title": "Croatian diaspora", "text": "Croatian diaspora\n\nCroatian diaspora refers to the Croatian communities that have formed outside Croatia. \nEstimates on its size are only approximate because of incomplete statistical records and naturalization, but (highest) estimates suggest that the Croatian diaspora numbers between a third and a half of the total number of Croats.\n\nMore than four million Croats live in Croatia. The largest community outside Croatia are the Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the constitutient nations of that country, amounting to about 750,000.\n\nThe Croatian diaspora outside Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina amounts to close to a million elsewhere in Europe, and to about 1.5 million overseas. The largest overseas community is reported from the United States and Chile, with about 400,000 members.\n\nIn Western Europe, the largest group is found in Germany. The German census reports 228,000 Croats in Germany , but estimates of the total number of people with direct Croatian ancestry (including naturalized German citizens) range as high as 450,000.\n\nCroats form one of the three constitutient nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are frequently referred to as Bosnian Croats, but since the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina the number of Herzegovinian Croats exceeds the number in Bosnia. The Croats maintain an unofficial capital in Mostar, with the city being home to the largest Croatian population.\n\nThere is no precise data regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina's population since the last war. The UNHCR conducted an unofficial census in 1996, but the data has not been recognized. Ethnic cleansing within Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s saw the vast majority of Croats move and take up residence in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is estimated that there are approximately 600,000 Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to 2000 data from the CIA World Factbook, Bosnia and Herzegovina is ethnically 14.3% Croat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2005 US census, there are 401,208 Americans of full or partial Croatian descent.\n\nCroatians in Detroit first appeared around 1890, settling usually in the region of Russel. In Illinois the Croatians started concentrating mostly around Chicago. Although it was created a bit later, the Croatian settlement in Chicago became one of the most important ones in the United States. The settlement especially started developing after World War I and Chicago became the center of all Croatian cultural and political activities. It is calculated that there were roughly 50,000 Croats in Chicago in the 1990s, while there were altogether 100,000 Croats living in 54 additional Croatian settlements in Illinois. There is a significant Croat population also in Indianapolis that settled during the Yugoslav Wars of the 90's.\n\nPittsburgh has always had a sizeable Croatian population. The headquarters of the Croatian Fraternal Union (CFU) - the oldest and largest Croatian organization in the United States - is located in the eastern suburb of Monroeville, PA, established in 1880's. The CFU publishes a weekly newspaper \"The Zajednicar Weekly\" in both English and Croatian. Most of the Croatians in Pittsburgh originally settled in the early 1900s on the city's North Side. A neighborhood centered on East Ohio Street along the Allegheny River between Millvale and the North Shore was named Mala Jaska after an area in Croatia (northwest of Zagreb).\n\nCroatians reportedly immigrated to Canada as early as 1541 when two Croatians from Dalmatia served on the crew of Jacques Cartier's third voyage to Canada. There are approximately 114,880 Canadians of Croatian ethnic origin as reported in the 2011 National Household Survey.\n\nThe Croatian community is present in most major Canadian cities (including Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa, Vancouver, Calgary, Windsor, and Montreal, as well as Mississauga and Oakville) in the form of designated Croatian churches, parks, and other organizations. \n\nNotable Croatian Canadian organizations include the Croatian Fraternal Union, the Croatian Canadian Folklore Federation (Vancouver), and the Croatian Canadian Cultural Centre (Calgary). Some of the more popular Croatian Canadian events are the Croatian-North American Soccer Tournament and the Canadian-Croatian Folklore Festival. Croatian Canadians have had a notable presence in the form of soccer teams all around Canada, one of the most famous clubs was the now defunct Toronto Metros-Croatia, who are succeeded by Toronto Croatia.\n\nCroats are an important ethnic group in Chile; they are citizens of Chile who were either born in Europe or are Chileans of Croatian descent deriving their Croatian ethnicity from one or both parents. Chile has one of the largest communities of ethnic Croats outside the Balkans Peninsula and it is one of the most significant communities in the Croatian diaspora - second only to that which is found in the United States. They are one of the main example of successful assimilation of a non Spanish-speaking European ethnic group into Chilean society. Many successful entrepreneurs, scientists, artists and prominent politicians holding the highest offices in the country have been of Croatian descent.\n\nThe Croatian community first established itself in two provinces situated in the extreme ends of Chile: Antofagasta, in the Atacama desert of the north and Punta Arenas in the Patagonian region in the south. The massive arrival of Croats in Chile began in 1864 and the migration grew steadily until 1956 – reaching a number of more than 60,000.\n\nIt is officially accepted that there are up to 400,000 Chileans of Croatian descent (who clearly identify themselves as Chilean-Croats). Even though the number may be much higher with some demographic analysts estimating a figure of 750,000.\n\nArgentine of Croatian descent number over 250,000. The most successful of all the Croats in Argentina was also almost the first to arrive. Nikola Mihanović came to Montevideo, Uruguay in 1867. Having settled in Buenos Aires, by 1909m Mihanović owned 350 vessels of one kind or another, including 82 steamers, owning, in that time, the biggest boat company in Argentina. By 1918, he employed 5,000 people, mostly from his native Dalmatia which was then under Austro-Hungarian and Italian rule. Mihanović by himself was thus a major factor in building up a Croat community which remains primarily Dalmatian to this day, although it contains people from other Croatian regions.\n\nThe second wave of Croat immigration was far more numerous, totalling 15,000 by 1939. Mostly peasants, these immigrants fanned out to work the land in Buenos Aires province, Santa Fe, Chaco and Patagonia. This wave was accompanied by a numerous clergy to attend their spiritual needs, especially Franciscans.\n\nIf the first two waves had been primarily economic, the third wave after the Second World War was eminently political. Some 20,000 Croatian political refugees came to Argentina, and most became construction workers on Peron's public works projects until they started to pick up some Spanish. Today, many descendants of the Croatian immigrants still know Croatian, although different than the modern-day Croatian language.\n\nThe Croatian community is present in most major Colombian cities, including Bogota, Cali and Barranquilla. There are approximately 5,800 Colombians of Croatian ethnic origin as reported.\n\nCroatian immigration to Venezuela dates back to the late nineteenth century, and was characterized by the individual arrival of merchant seamen. Until World War I, a few number of Croats settle in Venezuela, nevertheless it is in the period of the World War II when the Croatian families that escaped from the government of Tito begin to settle in the country. Most of these immigrants came from present-day Croatian territory, particularly from the coastal and inland areas of Dalmatia. Others came from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe majority of the members of the Croatian community settled in Caracas and Valencia and, to a lesser extent, in other cities of the interior: Maracay, Maracaibo, Mérida and in localities of the Yaracuy state, where some joined the work in the sugar industry. \n\nAlso, several forest technicians arrived that later contributed to the establishment of the School of Forestry Engineering at the University of the Andes. A large percentage of the Croatians were artisans, who later became small entrepreneurs, and many were professionals, especially engineers and technicians, who had outstanding performance in Venezuela.\n\nCroatia has been a source of migrants to Australia, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2006 118,051 persons resident in Australia (0.6%) identified themselves as having a Croatian ancestor.\n\nCroatian people are visible in all parts of Australian society, but they have made a big impact in the sporting arena with many football clubs being formed by immigrants, two of the more famous and most successful are Melbourne Knights FC and Sydney United both clubs having played in the Australia's top league the NSL and Melbourne Knights winning the championship back to back in the season 1994/5 and 1995/6. Sydney United have the honour of the club who has produced the largest number of full Australian internationals.\n\nSome famous Australia-Croatian football players to represent Australia are Mark Viduka, Jason Čulina, Mark Bresciano, Zeljko Kalac, Josip Skoko, Tony Popoviċ all who ironically lined up against Croatia in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, playing against Australian-born Croatian international Josip Šimunić.\n\nThe first Croat to settle in New Zealand is believed to be Pauvo Lupis (Paul) who deserted his Austrian ship in the late 1800s.\nAlthough Croats had contact with New Zealand and a few had settled the proper migration waves began when the Austro-Hungarian Empire allowed Italian wine and oil into the Empire's territories for a substantially less duty thus rendering peasants and farmers bankrupt, this treaty was the beginning of many events which causes migration mainly from Dalmatia .\n\n5,000 between 1890 and 1914, prior to World War I.\n1,600 during the 1920s before the onset of the Great Depression.\n600 in the 1930s, prior to World War II.\n3,200 between 1945 and 1970.\nArrivals during the 1990s, fleeing the conflict in former Yugoslavia.\n\nThe main destination for settlers was the Northland gum fields where the young boys were sent to dig Kauri tree gum from swamps which until the 1950s was used to varnish wooden furniture and the likes. Here on these fields, as outcasts by the British Empire and called 'Austrians' because of the passport they carried they were looked at with suspicion. Mainly because they worked hard and fast in a gang rather who would share profits and send money back to their villages in Dalmatia. Many British settlers who worked the same fields resented the Dalmatian gum-diggers, whom they nicknamed \"Dallies\", a term which is still occasionally used. On these fields as outcasts, they Croatian immigrants were thrown together with the other outcasts, the native Māori people who having many of the same view points and coming from villages themselves got on extremely well.\n\nMany Croatian men married Māori women as they came to New Zealand as bachelors before a bride could be sent from their home village. The local Maori called them \"Tarara\" because they spoke in Croatian very fast. Many Māori nowadays refer to themselves as Tarara and carry Croatian family names. Miss New Zealand 2010 Cody Yerkovich (spelled in Croatian as Jerković) is an example of the Māori Croatian mix Tarara.\n\nIn Modern times Croatian immigrants have continued to arrive, with many starting their own business with the abundance of good soil and land many turned to similar work that they did back in Dalmatia such as vineyards, orchards and fishing. Some notable companies in wine are Delegat, Nobilo, Selak, Villa Maria, Montana and Kuemue River Wines, all owned by Croatian families.\n\nIn fishing there are two big companies, the first Talley's Seafood founded in 1936, by Ivan Peter Talijancich (spelled Talijančić in Croatian) established Talley's in Motueka, New Zealand. The second being Simunovich (spelled Šimunović in Croatian) Fisheries Limited which has thrived and become a large company from the deep sea Scampi.\n\nIn sport many small clubs and associations have come and gone, but Central United formerly Central Croatia SC formed in 1962 is still going to this day. The football club, formed by a group of young Croatian immigrants from Dalmatia, played initially in the lower division of the Northern League before rising to become one of New Zealand's top football clubs by the late 1990s.\n\nCentral United FC were the New Zealand champions in 1999, 2001 and were runner-up in 1998. Central United FC also won the Chatham Cup in 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2007 and were runners-up in 2000 and 2001. Their home ground is at Kiwitea Street Stadium, in Sandringham (Auckland).\n\nSome notable former players are:\n\n\nOther notable New Zealanders of Croatian descent include singer Lorde (real name Ella Yelich-O'Connor), historian James Belich, golfer Frank Nobilo, rugby player Frano Botica, motor racing drivers Robbie Francevic and Paul Radisich, tennis player Marina Erakovic, architect Ivan Mercep, artist Milan Mrkusich, and musicians Peter and Margaret Urlich.\n\n"}

Some of his well-known roles include the abortionist in \"Alfie\" (1966), Marcus Brody in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) and \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (1989), Coleman in \"Trading Places\", (1983), and Mr. Emerson in \"A Room with a View\" (1985).\n\nElliott earned critical acclaim in his later career. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in \"A Room with a View\" and won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in three consecutive years in the 1980s, becoming the only actor ever to have achieved this. The American film critic Roger Ebert described him as \"the most dependable of all British character actors.\" \"The New York Times\" called him \"a star among supporting players\" and \"an accomplished scene-stealer\".\n\nElliott was born in London, the son of Nina (née Mitchell) and Myles Layman Farr Elliott. Myles was a barrister who had read law and Arabic at Cambridge before fighting with the Glosters at Gallipoli and in Mesopotamia. In 1930 Myles Elliott was appointed solicitor-general to the Mandatory Government in Palestine. Three years later, following a series of controversial government prosecutions, he was assassinated outside the King David Hotel and buried in the Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion.\nElliott's elder brother Neil was land agent to Lady Anne Cavendish-Bentinck.\n\nElliott attended Malvern College and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. He was asked to leave the academy after one term. As Elliott later recalled, \"They wrote to my mother and said, \"Much as we like the little fellow, he's wasting your money and our time. Take him away!\"\"\n\nIn the Second World War, he joined the Royal Air Force, training as a wireless operator/air gunner and serving with No. 76 Squadron RAF under the command of Leonard Cheshire. On the night of 23/24 September 1942, his Handley Page Halifax DT508 bomber took part in an air raid on the U-boat pens at Flensburg, Germany. The aircraft was hit by flak and subsequently ditched in the North Sea near Sylt, Germany. Only Elliott and two crewmen survived, and he spent the rest of the war in a prisoner of war camp in Silesia. While imprisoned, he became involved in amateur dramatics.\n\nAfter making his film debut in \"Dear Mr. Prohack\" (1949), he went on to play a wide range of parts, often ineffectual and occasionally seedy characters, such as the drunken journalist Bayliss in \"Defence of the Realm\", the criminal abortionist in \"Alfie\", and the washed-up film director in \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\". Elliott and Natasha Parry played the main roles in the 1955 television play \"The Apollo of Bellac\". He took over for an ill Michael Aldridge for one season of \"The Man in Room 17\" (1966)\n\nElliott made many television appearances, which included plays by Dennis Potter such as \"Follow the Yellow Brick Road\" (1972), \"Brimstone and Treacle\", (1976) and \"Blade on the Feather\" (1980). He starred in the BBC's adaptation of Charles Dickens's short story \"The Signalman\" (1976).\n\nIn the 1980s he won three consecutive British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards—Best Supporting Actor for \"Trading Places\" as Dan Aykroyd's kindly butler, \"A Private Function\", and \"Defence of the Realm\"—as well as an Academy Award nomination for \"A Room with a View\". He also became familiar to a wider audience as the well-meaning but addlepated Dr. Marcus Brody in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) and \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\". A photograph of his character appears in \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", and a reference is made to Brody's death. Also, a statue was dedicated to Marcus outside Marshall College, the school where Indy teaches. In 1988 Elliott was the Russian mole Povin, around whom the entire plot revolves, in the television miniseries \"\".\n\nHaving filmed Michael Winner's \"The Wicked Lady\" (1983), Elliott was quoted in a BBC Radio interview as saying that Marc Sinden and he \"are the only two British actors I am aware of who have ever worked with Winner more than once, and it certainly wasn't for love. But curiously, I never, ever saw any of the same crew twice.\" (Elliott in \"You Must Be Joking!\" (1965) and \"The Wicked Lady\" and Sinden in \"The Wicked Lady\" and \"Decadence\"). Elliott had worked with Sinden's father, Sir Donald Sinden, in the film \"The Cruel Sea\" (1953). He co-starred with Katharine Hepburn and Harold Gould in the television film \"Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry\" (1986) and with Nicole Kidman in \"Bangkok Hilton\" (1989).\n\nIn 1988 Elliott was appointed a commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to acting. His career included many stage performances, including with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and a well-acclaimed turn as the twin brothers in Jean Anouilh's \"Ring Round the Moon\". His scene-stealing abilities led Gabriel Byrne, his co-star in \"Defence of the Realm\", to say: \"Never act with children, dogs, or Denholm Elliott.\"\n\nDespite being described by British Film Institute's Screenonline as an actor of \"versatile understanding and immaculate technique,\" Elliott described himself as an instinctive actor and was a critic of Stanislavski's system of acting, saying, \"I mistrust and am rather bored with actors who are of the Stanislavski school who think about detail.\"\n\nPrivately bisexual, Elliott was married twice: first to actress Virginia McKenna for a few months in 1954, and later, in an open marriage, to American actress Susan Robinson (7 March 1942 – 12 April 2007), with whom he had two children, Mark and Jennifer. Jennifer commited suicide in 2003.\n\nElliott was diagnosed with HIV in 1987 and died of AIDS-related tuberculosis at his home in Santa Eulària des Riu on Ibiza, Spain, on 6 October 1992 at the age of 70. Tributes were paid by actors Sir Donald Sinden and Sir Peter Ustinov, playwright Dennis Potter, and former wife Virginia McKenna. Sinden said, \"He was one of the finest screen actors and a very special actor at that. He was one of the last stars who was a real gentleman. It is a very sad loss.\" Ustinov said, \"He was a wonderful actor and a very good friend on the occasions that life brought us together.\" Potter commented: \"He was a complicated, sensitive, and slightly disturbing actor. Not only was he a very accomplished actor, he was a dry, witty, and slightly menacing individual. As a man, I always found him very open, very straightforward and very much to the point.\" McKenna added: \"It is absolutely dreadful, but the person I am thinking of at the moment more than anybody is his wife. It must be terrible for her.\" Ismail Merchant described Elliott as \"an all-giving person, full of life ... He had an affection and feeling for other actors, which is very unusual in our business.\"\n\nHis widow set up a charity, the Denholm Elliott Project, and collaborated on his biography. She worked closely with the UK Coalition of People Living with HIV and AIDS. Susan Robinson Elliott died on 12 April 2007, aged 65, in a fire in her flat in London.\n\n\n"}

Her work initially consisted of publishing illegal underground newspapers with her sister. Lund worked for \"Frit Danmark,\"the most popular clandestine newspaper.\n\nWhen the Danish government was dissolved and Nazi Germany took over, Lund joined Holger Danske, a sabotage-oriented Resistance group. The first task was to procure fishing boats to take Jews to Sweden. Safe houses were set up for Jews until they could safely be taken to Sweden, and Lund's own house was used as a safe house. During her rescue operations, Lund became known as the Girl with the Red Cap or Red Riding Hood because of the red hat she woreto signal the Jews to be escorted to look for her. The Resistance did not only aid Jewish individuals, however; they also assisted defecting German soldiers and other Resistance members.\n\nThe Holger Danske group helped save 700-800 Jews in only a few weeks by offering means of escape. Lund herself had a hand in about 500 of these missions. Lund managed to escape arrest because, at a time when many of her fellow Resistance workers were being arrested, she was hospitalized with blood poisoning. In 1944, Lund became pregnant and withdrew entirely from Resistance work.\n\nAfter the war, Lund studied chemical engineering and immunology. She did important research on the polio virus in response to a polio epidemic in Denmark at the time. Lund became the head of the Department of Virology and Immunology at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Copenhagen.

{"id": "12720146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12720146", "title": "François Capois", "text": "François Capois\n\nFrançois Capois (or François Cappoix; 1766 – October 8, 1806, nicknamed Capois-La-Mort, also Cappoix-la-Mort, meaning \"Capois-Death\") was a Haitian officer in the Haitian Revolution (1791–1794) for independence from France.\n\nHe was born in Port-de-Paix, Saint-Domingue on the island of Hispaniola, on the plantation of Laveaux/Lapointe. His name was a transformation of the name \"cappouet\", owner of the plantation.\n\nHis military career began in 1793 after a visit with independence leader Toussaint Louverture at Port-de-Paix. Then under the colonel Jacques Maurepas he was a member of the 9th brigade. His rank in the army changed quickly, first to Lieutenant, then to Captain of the 3rd Battalion. He participated under general Jacques Maurepas against all expeditions and invasions in the north-eastern region of the island. Capois is mostly known for his extraordinary courage and especially his herculean bravery at the Battle of Vertières in which the French general Viscount of Rochambeau, commander of Napoleon's army in Saint-Domingue (colonial Haiti), even called a brief cease-fire to congratulate him.\n\nAfter receiving new troops from France, Rochambeau dispatched General Clauzel against Port-de-Paix which Capois was forced to evacuate, but the fearless black general redeemed his defeat by storming the \"Petit-Fort\" where he captured the ammunition, of which he was in great need. After his success at \"Petit-Fort\", he decided to attack Tortuga island (\"Île de la Tortue\"). The most difficult problem he had in this attack was how to reach this island without ships. He made up for this lack by building a raft consisting merely of planks held together by lianas. \n\nOn the night of February 18, 1803, 150 soldiers under the command of Vincent Louis were huddled together on this frail means of transportation in tow of 2 rowboats. They fell unexpectedly on the garrison of Tortuga and for a while seemed to be the conquerors. But the French, who soon got over their surprise, rallied and defeated Vincent Louis, who succeeded in making his escape with some of his companions. The unfortunate blacks who were taken prisoner by the French were tortured to death in expiation of the audacious attempt. \n\nThe failure did not discourage the energy of Capois. On April 12, 1803, Capois stormed Port-de-Paix, and soon after, Vincent Louis on his raft was again on his way to Tortuga. He succeeded this time in taking possession of the island, which the French never recovered.\n\nOn November 18, 1803, Jean-Jacques Dessalines had ordered Capois to take Vertières, a fort situated upon a mount. Capois-la-Mort advanced with a demi-brigade which, horribly mutilated, soon recoiled before the cannon fire coming from the fort. He led it back for a second time, but was again driven to the bottom of the hill by the mitrailleuse. \n\nBoiling with rage, Capois ran to seek other new troops and, mounting his horse, advanced for the third time; again the thousand deaths that vomited from the fortress repulsed him and his brigade. Now for the fourth time, he asked his men to follow him by saying \"Forward! forward!\". While he was at the head of his men, his horse was hit by a cannonball—he fell, but Capois took his sword, got up, and ran to place himself again at the head of his black soldiers by shouting \"Forward! Forward!\" His cap, garnished with plumes, was carried away by a shot. He replied to the insult which left him hatless by drawing his sword and again throwing himself into the assault. \n\nObserving this, Rochambeau and his men shouted: \"Bravo! bravo! bravo!\" The firing in the fort ceased. Suddenly, the battle was still. A French staff officer mounted his horse and rode toward the intrepid Capois-la-Mort. With a great voice he shouted: \"General Rochambeau sends compliments to the general who has just covered himself with such glory!\" Then he saluted the Haitian warriors, returned to his position and the fight resumed. \n\nThe next morning, a French officer followed by his companions led to the headquarters of the Haitian army a horse caparisoned, and delivered him with these words: \"The Captain-general (Rochambeau) offers this horse as a mark of admiration to the \"black Achilles\" to replace the one of his that the French army regrets having killed.\"\n\nOn October 8, 1806, Capois was on his way to Cap-Haïtien when, near Limonade, he rode into a trap set for him, and was killed by assassins on the orders of Henri Christophe.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25614856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25614856", "title": "Health of Robert E. Howard", "text": "Health of Robert E. Howard\n\nThe health of American author Robert E. Howard (1906–1936), especially his mental health, has been the focus of the biographical and critical analysis of his life. In terms of physical health, Howard had a weak heart which he treated by taking digitalis. The precise nature of Howard's mental health has been much debated, both during his life and following his suicide. Three main points of view exists. Some have declared that Howard suffered from an Oedipus complex or similar mental disorder. Another viewpoint is that Howard suffered from major depressive disorder. The third view is that Howard had no disorders and his suicide was a common reaction to stress.\n\nHoward had a weak heart, which was treated by taking digitalis. The first indication of this problem came when, while working with an oil-field surveyor in the period before he became a successful author, Howard passed out in the heat. A later diagnosis confirmed that his heart had a mild tendency to race under stress and he was told that a heavy blow to his chest could be fatal.\n\nOn December 29, 1933 Howard was involved in a traffic accident. Driving back from a football game in Brownwood with three friends in the mist and rain, he crashed into a flag pole in Ranger. A piece of windshield cut his neck close to the jugular vein and he was forced heavily into the steering column. This impact to his chest could have been lethal with his heart problems but he escaped with just bruised ribs. None of the other passengers were seriously injured either and one escaped injury altogether. The town helped to pay for repairs to the car and the flag pole was eventually removed following further accidents.\n\nIn the years since his suicide, there has been a lot of speculation about Robert E. Howard's mental health. Even during his life, others in Cross Plains thought of him as crazy or odd. Some have suggested that he had an Oedipus complex, others have found evidence for clinical depression, and others still have diagnosed him as being mentally healthy. His act of suicide is often the basis of these opinions. Almost all speculation is in the form of amateur-psychoanalysis from people with no qualifications in the field.\n\nThe people of Cross Plains considered Howard to be an odd person and possibly \"crazy\". Cross Plains was mainly used to blue-collar agricultural and oil field work, as well as professions such as a teacher or doctor; they were not used to some who only wrote all day. From their perspective, Howard did not seem to be doing any work at all. His neighbors even complained about the noise he made typing, as well as loudly reading his own narration as he did so, throughout the day.\n\nHoward displayed eccentric behavior, such as: having his pants hemmed short so he would not trip in a potential fight; carrying a gun in his car in case of enemies; shouting stories as he wrote them; dressing oddly for the time and place, including a large moustache and sombrero; shadow-boxing as he walked down the street. At the time, Novalyne Price told her roommate, \"He’s trying to tell people he’s a writer and writers have a right to be odd. Since they think he’s crazy, anyway, he’ll show them just how crazy he can be.\" In the wake of his break-up with Novalyne Price, Howard's behavior became increasing eccentric. On one occasion, having taken Novalyne to a drug store for a soda, he loudly and publicly re-told his story \"Red Nails.\" He changed his appearance and grew a large, drooping mustache. Later he began to wear about town a black sombrero with red bandana and black vaquero pants.\n\nDr. Charles Gramlich's opinion on Howard's behavior is that these are either normal acts or just eccentricities, which does not extend to having a mental disorder. The carrying of gun is, in Gramlich's opinion, normal for Texas, especially in the 1930s when the Wild West was within recent, living memory. The story about needing the gun in case of \"enemies,\" given to E. Hoffmann Price, may have just been a tall tale invented by Howard for his friend. Novalyne Price considered Howard's talk of enemies to be part of an act. Finn notes that highwaymen had operated in the area during the oil boom and this was the reason Howard gave to Price for the gun. The shadow-boxing and shouting out of stories as they were written were due to Howard being a writer and simply getting caught up in a story. Other acts were intentionally eccentric as a reaction to the criticism from other townspeople. He was expressing his anger to this criticism by acting in a contrary manner.\n\nHoward maintained in correspondence with other writers that he was a failure and a hack. This was despite being commercially successful, sought after by publishers and receiving fan mail for his work. When sending condolences to August Derleth in May 1936, the month before his suicide, Howard wrote \"Death to the old is inevitable, and yet somehow I often feel that it is a greater tragedy than death to the young...I don't want to live to be old. I want to die when my time comes, quickly and suddenly, in the full tide of my strength.\" E. Hoffmann Price visited Howard in early 1934. His impression on leaving was \"Bob lived in a dream world people by enemies, and by peers and other folks who downgraded him.\"\n\nHoward suffered from nightmares and sleep walking into his early twenties, probably as a result of stress. In spring 1926, Howard went to Brownwood to see Tevis Clyde Smith. In the night Clyde Smith was woken by Howard's scream; he saw him wrestle with a large shape and fall through a closed window. The family found him wandering outside in a daze. Clyde Smith talked to him until he went back to sleep, on prior instructions, and then woke him. Howard had apparently dreamed that he saw a newspaper with the headline \"Axe Murderer Slays Three.\"\n\nIn 1930, Howard went to a hospital in Temple complaining of a varicocele, gas in the stomach and an abnormally small penis. The working diagnosis at the time was sexual neurasthenia but the symptoms may instead point towards neurotic depressive disorder. The doctor concluded that \"We do not think there is anything wrong with Robert. We can find no varicocele of any consequence, and his organs are normally developed and he tests out good in every respect. His trouble, in our judgment, is due to his thinking there is something wrong. After he has dispelled this thought from his mind he will be in fine shape.\"\n\nBiographer Mark Finn suggests that Howard picked up on his mother's depression. She was dying of tuberculosis and may have suffered a miscarriage in October 1907. Howard's father's job as a country doctor required him to make long journeys away from home, which would often mean him spending the night elsewhere. This frequently left Howard alone with his mother and later put him in the role of primary caregiver. The situation may have been exacerbated by frequent moves during his youth, which prevented Howard making many friends of his own during his early years, and the gradual breakdown of his parents' marriage. His life was not his own and he developed a hatred of authority and any control placed over him. He rebelled by boxing and drinking but, nevertheless, he felt duty-bound to remain and look after his mother. Even after he became a success as a writer, he continued to live with his parents; although this was not unusual at the time. Finn writes that \"Robert was clinically depressed by any definition applicable, and had been for many years. Whether the cause of the depression was a chemical imbalance, an untenable situation at home, or a combination of the two is not important.\" His suicide, once his duty to his mother was done, may have been an act of finally asserting control over his own life.\n\nL. Sprague de Camp wrote in \"The Science Fiction Handbook\" (1953) that \"the neurotic Howard suffered from an Oedipean devotion to his mother and... from delusions of persecution.\" Faced with refutations from Glenn Lord, de Camp eventually stopped making claims about an Oedipus Complex but maintained that Howard was insane, especially due to Howard's suicide.\n\nA lot of the speculations about Howard's mental state appear to originate in the first, flawed, biography of Howard, \"Dark Valley Destiny\" by L. Sprague de Camp and others. These tend to be from a Freudian perspective and suggest an Oedipal attraction between Robert and his mother Hester, based on the facts that Howard took care of his dying mother, that his bedroom had a window through to his parents' bedroom and that he killed himself on the day she was going to die herself. Gramlich points out that Dr. Isaac Howard's job forced him to take house calls and be away on business while Robert E. Howard's job as a writer meant he was at home most of the time; so, naturally, Robert became the primary caregiver. Howard's bedroom was a converted porch and the window was a pre-existing part of the building.\n\nDr. Charles Gramlich, a professor of psychology and an author of fantasy fiction, believes that Howard had no mental disorders and that amateur psychoanalysis has only come to such a conclusion through cherry-picking of evidence from Howard's life. Burke concurs that almost all speculation is in the form of amateur psychoanalysis from people like L. Sprague de Camp with no qualifications in the field.\n\nConfidants such as Tevis Clyde Smith and Novalyne Price Ellis found Howard to be an agreeable companion most of the time, full of life and good humor — but always with an underlying simmering melancholy. Smith noted that Howard first mentioned suicide in October 1923 when a classmate, Roy Guthrie, committed suicide. It affected Howard and he increasingly defended the right to do so in later years. Howard may have considered suicide as early as 1925. Howard first talked of his own death in 1928 when his dog Patch was dying. When Novalyne Price was admitted to hospital in 1935, her doctor, a friend of Howard's father, asked her if Howard had ever talked about not wanting to live after his mother died.\n\nRegarding Howard's suicide, Gramlich believes it was nothing to do with any long-term mental abnormality; it was a common reaction to the strain he was under at the time. While Howard did talk of suicide during his life, statistics show that one out of three teenagers contemplate suicide and the details of Howard's are normal (white, single, from the south of the United States, with a gun). At the moment of Howard's death, he was mentally and physically exhausted with little available support: he was caring for his dying mother as her condition got worse; he was not being paid the money owed to him by \"Weird Tales\", at a time when he needed it for his mother's healthcare bills; he was working increasingly harder to make the money through other markets; his relationship with Novalyne Price had recently broken down; Tevis Clyde Smith had recently married and moved away; he did not have a strong relationship with his father. Gramlich ends by saying \"He wasn't crazy; he was just a very good writer.\"\n\nDavid Hayles wrote in the Times: \"Maybe, at the end of it all, Howard felt that he had done what he needed to do. The prolific writer, whose 160-plus published stories were full of men facing death on their own terms, wanted to do the same. In a letter to the fantasy writer August Derleth he stated: 'I don’t want to live to be old. I want to die when my time comes, quickly and suddenly, in the full tide of my strength and health.' Youthful bravado perhaps, but he was true to his word. He wrote about men who didn’t age — his heroes were immortal. In bowing out in his prime, so was Robert E. Howard.\"\n\n"}

He was co-founder and chairman of the Palestine Arab Party, established in Jerusalem in 1935, and in 1937 became a member of the first Arab Higher Committee, led by Amin al-Husayni, later becoming its chairman.\n\nDuring the 1936-39 Arab revolt he escaped first to Syria (1937) and then to Baghdad, Iraq (1939). He led the Arab delegation to the 1939 London Conference and was Palestinian representative to the Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry. Husayni was arrested by the British in 1941 and exiled to Southern Rhodesia. He was released at the end of World War II and returned to Palestine in 1946. He was an unofficial delegate to the United Nations in 1947-48. In September–October 1948 he was the foreign minister in the Egyptian-sponsored All-Palestine Government.\n\nHusayni was born in 1894 into the Husayni family, one of the most influential families in Jerusalem. He went to the Church of England school, St Georges, where he was the first pupil to wear western style clothes and where he became an enthusiastic player of the new sport – football. On finishing his secondary education, aged eighteen, he entered the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut to study medicine. At that time the Medical faculty was alive with debate about the status of Arabs under a Government based in Istanbul and dominated by Turks and Turkish. Jamal became a member of the \"Nadi Al-Arabi\" and \"al-Muntada al-Adabi\" movements in 1918-19 which, according to Isaac Friedman,\nwere \"hostile to British rule and who wanted to reinstate Turkish rule in the former Ottoman Nadi Al-Arabian Asiatic provinces.\" \nDuring the time of Jamal's membership, \"al-Muntada al-Arabi\" were committed to the concepts of pan-Arabism and anti-Zionism and supported a new Greater Syrian nation under King Faisal. In May 1919 this political activity was such that the British government prohibited any further meetings, speeches, or public activities by the club.\n\nIn December 1914, two years into Jamal's studies, Ottoman Turk guards raided the college arresting anyone suspected belonged to a secret Arab nationalist organization, and Jamal fled to Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1915 four of Jamal's fellow-members of the Beirut branch of the \"al-Muntada al-Arabi\" were hanged for treason by Djemal Pasha. During the First World War he was conscripted into the Turkish Army and later taken prisoner by the British.\n\nJamal and his peer group moved in elite Palestinian circles. His relative, Amin was to become head of the Supreme Muslim Council. His brother-in-law, Musa Alami, worked in the British administration and rose to become personal secretary to the High Commissioner. Musa's wife was the daughter of Ihsan al-Jabri one of the Arab delegates to the League of Nations.\n\nLater his young cousin Abd al-Qadir was to become a Palestinian military leader fighting the British in 1936-39 and the emerging Israelis in 1948.\n\nBy 1921, aged 27, he had become a senior figure in Palestinian politics. His uncle, Musa Kazim, an Ottoman administrator and under the British, briefly, Mayor of Jerusalem, was chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Arab Congress formed by the Muslim-Christian Associations, which had been established following the arrival of the British. Jamal was appointed Secretary to the Executive. Jamal and Musa Kazim were at this time considered the foremost representatives of the Palestinian Arab community. Following the disturbances of 1921, also known as the Jaffa Riots, Jamal had a meeting with the High Commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel, and issued a statement calling for calm.\n\nAt the 6th Congress in 1923 he was one of the delegates calling for a tax strike, demanding Arab representation in the administration. The proposed strike was abandoned in the face of opposition from the major land owners who dominated the Congress. Instead it chose to boycott proposed elections for a Legislative Council and in June all the Arab members of the British Advisory Council resigned their positions.\n\nDuring this period the British regarded him as reasonable and pragmatic. In 1923 he made an extended visit to India and met many Muslim leaders.\n\nIn 1924 he met with Jewish Agency member Haim Kalvarisky to present proposals for the structure of a Legislative Council. It would have two chambers, the lower would be elected with the High Commissioner having power of veto over its decisions. The upper chamber would consist of ten members selected on a communal basis with two of the members representing the Jewish community. Immigration would be controlled by a commission. These proposals were rejected by the Jewish Agency. But by this time Jamal had become disillusioned with the Executive Committee and had to be persuaded to keep his position as Secretary. One of his complaints was lack of funds for administration.\n\nAs well as his political activities Jamal also pursued a career as an advocate. In 1927 he petitioned the High Court for the removal of the Hebrew letters 'EI' from the newly issued Palestine stamps. The two letters, followed the word 'Palestine' in Hebrew and stood for Eretz Israel - “Land of Israel”. The petition was rejected.\n\nIn 1929, just prior to the rioting over Zionist activity at the Wailing Wall, the deputy High Commissioner, H.C. Luke, organised a lengthy meeting between Arab and Jewish Agency leaders in attempt to calm the situation. The Arab delegation was led by Jamal. The hoped for joint statement did not materialize. Following the riots, in October, he was leader of a delegation sent to London for meetings at the Colonial Office. This was in his capacity as Secretary to the Supreme Muslim Council, an organisation which had been set up by the British, and was led by Hajj Amin Husseini, to whom he was related both through his father and mother. It was the first Palestinian Arab delegation to go to London since 1922 and included Adil Arslan and Izzat Tannous. One of its objectives was the setting up of an information center in London.\n\nAt the end of 1930 Jamal had further meetings in London with British officials who liked his conciliatory approach. He agreed to proposals for a round table conference with members of the Jewish Agency. His one condition was that the Jewish delegates should come from Palestine and specifically that Weizmann should not be a member since this would be an act of recognition of validity of Zionist claims over Palestine. He returned to Palestine, in January 1931, feeling progress had been made. At this time he was also active as a journalist. In 1933 he published a series of anonymous articles in the Damascus newspaper \"Alif Ba\" in which he accused Awni Abd al-Hadi, leader of the new Independence Party, \"Istiqlal\", of selling 40,000 dunum of land in Wadi Hawarith to the Jewish Agency six years earlier. A 1937 Jewish Agency list has Jamal's name as having acted as an attorney in a similar land sale. It is an indication of how much information the Jewish Agency was collecting. Another example is a file which records discussions at an Executive Committee meeting, 12 April 1933, at which the imminent meeting, organised by Haim Arlosoroff, between Chaim Weizmann and leaders from Transjordan was discussed. The notes indicate that Jamal argued that the committee had no influence over tribal leaders east of the Jordan and that the meeting should be ignored.\n\nIn October 1934 the Executive Committee called for demonstrations against government policy. The authorities responded by arresting Jamal al-Husayni whom they held responsible.\n\nIn April 1935 he launched the Palestine Arab Party, \"Al Hisb Al-Arabi Al Falastini\" to represent the Husseini power bloc. The party was not the first mass-membership Palestinian Arab political party. It had been preceded by \"Istiqlal\" (1932) and the National Defence Party, \"Hazb al-defa al Watany\", (1934) as Palestinian Arabs began organising themselves into political parties after the decline of the National Congress and the Muslim-Christian Associations. The party had offices in all the major Arab towns with a program calling for opposition to Zionism and the Mandate, Arab unity and an end of land sales to the Jewish Agency.\n\nIn December 1935 Jamal attended a memorial ceremony for Izz ad-Din al-Qassam in Haifa, and made a speech to the crowd of 6,000 in which he predicted that al-Qassam would become a symbol of Palestinian resistance. Following the crushing of the al-Qassam insurgency the Wauchope administration put forward new proposals for a legislative council coupled with restrictions on land sales. The Jewish Agency swiftly rejected the proposals while the Palestinian Arab Party did not reject them completely until April 1936 several months after they had been blocked by the United Kingdom's Houses of Parliament. The party appeared to be in closer touch with public opinion when, in 1936, it declined an invitation to talks with the Colonial Office in London which the other parties had accepted. A week later, on 21 April 1936, the party announced its support for the General Strike. Four days later the Higher Arab Committee was formed from the leadership of all the main factions. Hajj Amin was chairman and Awni Abd al-Hadi was secretary. One of the Committee's priorities was an end to Jewish immigration. Jamal later replaced Hadi as secretary following Hadi's internment at Sarafand military base in June 1936. At the same time a four-man delegation, including Jamal, were given visas to go to London for meetings at the Colonial Office to find a way of ending the strike. It is suggested that Jamal was forced to take a harder line than he wished due to pressure from more radical elements. The talks failed. On 1 October 1937 the authorities banned all Palestinian Arab nationalist organisations and Jamal went into exile.\n\nIn 1934 Jamal, with his Pan-Arab views, was advocating the dispersal of the Jews in Palestine across an independent, federated Arab World. Jamal had some contact with the pacifist president of Jerusalem's Hebrew University, Judah Magnes, and was possibly involved in proposals that Magnus presented to David Ben Gurion in 1935. In 1936 Jamal's brother in law, Musa Alami, held a series of meetings with Magnus at which a number of proposals were outlined, but neither Ben Gurion nor Jamal were willing to publicly endorse them. The move was overtaken by the strike and the establishment of the Arab Higher Committee. Zionist archives record an Arab source saying that Jamal was the only member of the committee who would not accept bribes. Sharett, head of the Jewish Agency Political Department, is quoted as saying that Jamal, and his cousin Hajj Amin, were the only honest Palestinian leaders. In 1937, following the end of the general strike, Jamal attempted to open negotiations with American Zionists with the help of the Beth Shalom group. His priority was to limit the number of Jews arriving in Palestine and to end land sales to Jewish organisations. In Jerusalem he edited a newspaper called \"al-Liwa\".\n\nIn 1938 he set up an information office in Damascus which received some funds from the local German and Italian Consulates. Meanwhile, within Palestine the British and the Jewish Agency were funding 'Peace Bands' to combat the rebel's successes. During this period his proposals included pledges of equal rights for Jews in any future Palestine. In 1939 he led the Arab delegation to the London Conference following the failure of which the British Government announced its plans for the future of Palestine in a White Paper which included plans for a limit to Jewish immigration. By this time Jamal had become far more outspoken: “The Jews have turned Palestine into hell.” The outbreak of the Second World War ended all diplomatic activity related to Palestine and the British proposals were quietly shelved.\n\nIn 1940 he and Amin al-Husayni moved to Baghdad where he held two weeks of meetings with Colonel Stewart Newcombe. Following these meeting both Jamal and Musa al-Alami agreed to the terms of the White Paper and both signed a copy of it in the presence of the Prime Minister of Iraq Nuri as-Said. The following year, following the collapse of the Rashidi revolt, he was amongst a group of eighty who fled to Tehran. On his continued attempt to escape the British he was taken prisoner at Ahwaz and interned in Southern Rhodesia where he was held until November 1945 when he was allowed to move to Cairo. In Egypt he built ties with the Muslim Brotherhood. The leader of the mainstream Wafd party, Mustafa el-Nahhas, regarded him as an extremist. In 1945 the Arab Higher Council was reformed, once again dominated by traditional leaders from the 1930s.\n\nHe was not allowed back into Palestine until February 1946 where he represented the Arab case to the Anglo-American Commission. His presentation was poorly received, in particular when compared to that given by Henry Cattan. Also in 1946 he was invited as the Palestinian Arab delegate to the meeting of the Arab League, held at Bludan, Syria.\n\nIn 1946 Fawzi Husseini, an advocate of dialogue with the Jewish Agency, was assassinated. In an Egyptian newspaper Jamal was quoted as saying that Fawzi 'had strayed'. Other sources quote Jamal as being responsible for all actions taken against collaborators.\n\nIn Palestine he embarked on several measures to unify the nationalist movement. He merged the two main youth movements and took over the Land Bank set up by Ahmed Hilmi.\n\nIn 1947 the Arab Higher Committee was recognised by the British Government as representing Palestinian Arabs. Two months later it was recognised by the newly created United Nations and Jamal travelled to Lake Success, New York, as the spokesman for Palestinian Arabs to the UN.\n\nCritics maintain that both Jamal and Amin al-Husayni failed to recognise the importance to the Haganah military operations at the beginning of 1948. Jamal's activities at the UN ended when in July he refused to attend any debates or meetings at which there were Israeli representatives.\n\nHe returned to Palestine where he was Foreign Minister for the short lived Palestinian Arab Government.\n\nIn 1950 he joined the entourage of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia later becoming a close advisor to King Saud.\n\nAccording to Jordanian intelligence reports, in 1954 Jamal funded a group that failed in an attempt to sabotage an Israeli Air Force base in the Jezreel Valley. The same source states that in July 1954 Jamal broke away from Amin al-Husayni and began working exclusively for the Saudis. From January 1955 he was given 1 million Lebanese pounds to finance attacks on Israel from Lebanon. The money was paid to \"middle men\" but no attacks materialised.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "197754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197754", "title": "Joe Meek", "text": "Joe Meek\n\nRobert George \"Joe\" Meek (5 April 1929 – 3 February 1967) was an English record producer, sound engineer and songwriter who pioneered space age and experimental pop music. He also assisted the development of recording practices like overdubbing, sampling and reverb. Meek is considered one of the most influential sound engineers of all time, being one of the first to develop ideas such as the use of recording studios as instruments, and being recognized for his individual identity as an artist.\n\nMeek's charting singles he produced for other artists include \"Johnny Remember Me\" (John Leyton, 1961), \"Just Like Eddie\" (Heinz, 1963), \"Angela Jones\" (Michael Cox, 1963), \"Have I the Right?\" (the Honeycombs, 1964), and \"Tribute to Buddy Holly\" (Mike Berry, 1961). The Tornados' instrumental \"Telstar\" (1962), written and produced by Meek, became the first record by a British rock group to reach number one in the US Hot 100. It also spent five weeks at number one in the UK singles chart, with Meek receiving an Ivor Novello Award for this production as the \"Best-Selling A-Side\" of 1962. He also produced music for films such as \"Live It Up!\" (US title \"Sing and Swing\", 1963), a pop music film. Meek's concept album \"I Hear a New World\" (1960), which contains innovative use of electronic sounds, was not fully released in his lifetime.\n\nHis reputation for experiments in recording music was acknowledged by the Music Producers Guild who in 2009 created \"The Joe Meek Award for Innovation in Production\" as an \"homage to [the] remarkable producer's pioneering spirit\". In 2014, Meek was ranked the greatest producer of all time by \"NME\", elaborating: \"Meek was a complete trailblazer, attempting endless new ideas in his search for the perfect sound. ... The legacy of his endless experimentation is writ large over most of your favourite music today.\"\n\nAt the time of his death, Meek possessed thousands of unreleased recordings later dubbed \"The Tea Chest Tapes\". His commercial success as a producer was short-lived, and he gradually sank into debt and depression. On 3 February 1967, using a shotgun owned by musician Heinz Burt, Meek killed his landlady Violet Shenton and then shot himself.\n\nMeek was born at 1 Market Square, Newent, Gloucestershire, and developed an interest in electronics and performance art at a very early age, filling his parents' garden shed with begged and borrowed electronic components, building circuits, radios and what is believed to be the region's first working television. During his national service in the Royal Air Force, he worked as a radar technician which increased his interest in electronics and outer space. From 1953 he worked for the Midlands Electricity Board. He used the resources of the company to develop his interest in electronics and music production, including acquiring a disc cutter and producing his first record.\n\nHe left the electricity board to work as an audio engineer for a leading independent radio production company which made programmes for Radio Luxembourg, and made his breakthrough with his work on Ivy Benson's \"Music for Lonely Lovers\". His technical ingenuity was first shown on the Humphrey Lyttelton jazz single \"Bad Penny Blues\" (Parlophone Records, 1956) when, contrary to Lyttleton's wishes, Meek 'modified' the sound of the piano and compressed the sound to a greater than normal extent. The record became a hit. He then put enormous effort into Denis Preston's Landsdowne Studio but tensions between Preston and Meek soon saw Meek leaving. During his time he recorded US actor George Chakiris for SAGA Records and it was this that led him to Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks and an independent career. He also engineered many jazz and calypso records including vocalist and percussionist Frank Holder and band leader Kenny Graham.\n\nIn January 1960, together with William Barrington-Coupe, Meek founded Triumph Records. At the time Barrington-Coupe was working at SAGA records in Empire Yard, Holloway Road for Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks and it was the Major who provided the finance. The label very nearly had a No.1 hit with Meek's production of \"Angela Jones\" by Michael Cox. Cox was one of the featured singers on Jack Good's TV music show \"Boy Meets Girl\" and the song was given massive promotion. As an independent label, Triumph was dependent on small pressing plants, which were unable to meet the demand for product. The record made a respectable appearance in the Top Ten, but it demonstrated that Meek needed the distribution network of the major companies for his records to reach the shops when it mattered.\n\nIts indifferent business results and Meek's temperament eventually led to the label's demise. Meek later licensed many Triumph recordings to labels such as Top Rank and Pye. That year Meek conceived, wrote and produced an \"Outer Space Music Fantasy\"' an Album \"I Hear A New World\" with a band called Rod Freeman & the Blue Men. The album was shelved for decades, apart from the release of some EP tracks taken from it.\n\nMeek went on to set up his own production company known as RGM Sound Ltd (later Meeksville Sound Ltd) with toy importer Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks as his financial backer. He operated from his home studio which he constructed at 304 Holloway Road, Islington, a three-floor flat above a leather-goods store.\n\nHis first hit from Holloway Road reached No.1 in the UK: John Leyton's \"Johnny Remember Me\" (1961) written by Geoff Goddard. This \"death ditty\" was cleverly promoted by Leyton's manager, expatriate Australian entrepreneur Robert Stigwood. Stigwood was able to gain Leyton a booking to perform the song several times in an episode of \"Harpers West One\", a short-lived ITV soap opera in which he was making a guest appearance. Meek's third UK No.1 and last major success was with the Honeycombs' \"Have I the Right?\" in 1964, which also became a number 5 hit on the American \"Billboard\" pop charts. The success of Leyton's recordings was instrumental in establishing Stigwood and Meek as two of Britain's first independent record producers.\n\nWhen his landlords, who lived downstairs, felt that the noise was too much, they would indicate so with a broom on the ceiling. Joe would signal his contempt by placing loudspeakers in the stairwell and turning up the volume.\n\nA privately manufactured \"black plaque\" (designed to ape the official blue plaque) has since been placed at the location of the studio to commemorate Meek's life and work.\n\nMeek heard many up and coming bands and artists over his career, some of which he didn't see any potential for. After Brian Epstein asked his opinion of the Beatles' demo tape, Meek told him not to bother signing them. On another occasion he signed a band on the condition that they get rid of their lead singer: a 16-year-old Rod Stewart.\n\nMeek became fascinated with the idea of communicating with the dead. He would set up tape machines in graveyards in an attempt to record voices from beyond the grave, in one instance capturing the meows of a cat he held was speaking in human tones, asking for help. In particular, he had an obsession with Buddy Holly (saying the late American rocker had communicated with him in dreams) and other dead rock and roll musicians. By the end of his career, Meek's fascination with these topics had taken over his life following the deterioration in his mental health, and he started to believe that his flat contained poltergeists, that aliens were substituting his speech by controlling his mind, and that photographs in his studio were trying to communicate with him.\n\nMeek was affected by bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and upon receiving an apparently innocent phone call from American record producer Phil Spector, Meek immediately accused Spector of stealing his ideas before hanging up angrily. His professional efforts were often hindered by his paranoia (Meek was convinced that Decca Records would put hidden microphones behind his wallpaper to steal his ideas), depression, and extreme mood swings. In later years, Meek started experiencing psychotic delusions, culminating in Meek refusing to use the studio telephone for important communications due to his belief that his landlady was eavesdropping on his calls through the chimney, his belief that he could control the minds of others with his recording equipment, and that he could monitor his acts while away from the studio through supernatural means.\n\nMeek was also a frequent recreational drug user, with his barbiturate abuse further worsening his depressive episodes. In addition, his heavy consumption of amphetamines caused him to fly into volatile rages with little or no provocation, at one point leading him to hold a gun to the head of drummer Mitch Mitchell to 'inspire' a high-quality performance.\n\nMeek's homosexuality – at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in the UK – put him under further pressure, and he was particularly afraid that his mother would find out about his sexual orientation. In 1963 he was convicted and fined £15 () for \"importuning for immoral purposes\" in a London public toilet, and was consequently subject to blackmail. In January 1967, police in Tattingstone, Suffolk, discovered two suitcases containing mutilated body parts of Bernard Oliver. According to some accounts, Meek was afraid of being questioned by the Metropolitan Police, as it was known they were intending to interview all of the gay men in London. This was enough for him to lose his self-control.\n\nMeek always walked everywhere outside the studio wearing sunglasses, fearing recognition by local gangsters such as the Kray twins, who he feared would attempt to steal his acts or blackmail him regarding his homosexuality.\n\nMeek's depression deepened as his financial position became increasingly desperate. French composer Jean Ledrut accused him of plagiarism, claiming that the melody of \"Telstar\" had been copied from \"La Marche d'Austerlitz\", a piece from a score Ledrut had written for the 1960 film \"Austerlitz\". The lawsuit meant that Meek did not receive royalties from the record during his lifetime, and the issue was not resolved in his favour until three weeks after his death in 1967.\n\nOn 3 February 1967, Meek killed his landlady Violet Shenton and then himself with a single-barrelled shotgun that he had confiscated from his protégé, former Tornados bassist and solo star Heinz Burt, at his Holloway Road home/studio. Meek had flown into a rage and taken the gun from Burt when he informed Meek that he had used it while on tour to shoot birds. Meek had kept the gun under his bed, along with some cartridges. As the shotgun had been owned by Burt, he was questioned intensively by police, before being eliminated from their enquiries.\n\nMeek was subsequently buried at Newent Cemetery, Newent, Gloucestershire. His black granite tombstone can be found near the middle of the cemetery.\n\nMeeks' inability to play a musical instrument or write notation did not prevent him writing and producing successful commercial recordings. For songwriting he was reliant on musicians such as Dave Adams, Geoff Goddard or Charles Blackwell to transcribe melodies from his vocal \"demos\". He worked on 245 singles, of which 45 reached the top fifty. He pioneered studio tools such as multiple over-dubbing on one- and two-track machines, close miking, direct input of bass guitars, the compressor, and effects like echo and reverb, as well as sampling. Unlike other producers, his search was for the 'right' sound rather than for a catchy musical tune, and throughout his brief career he single-mindedly followed his quest to create a unique \"sonic signature\" for every record he produced.\n\nAt a time when many studio engineers were still wearing white coats and assiduously trying to maintain clarity and fidelity, Meek was producing everything on the three floors of his \"home\" studio and was never afraid to distort or manipulate the sound if it created the effect he was seeking.\n\nMeek was one of the first producers to grasp and fully exploit the possibilities of the modern recording studio. His innovative techniques—physically separating instruments, treating instruments and voices with echo and reverb, processing the sound through his fabled home-made electronic devices, the combining of separately-recorded performances and segments into a painstakingly constructed composite recording—comprised a major breakthrough in sound production. Up to that time, the standard technique for pop recording was to record all the performers in one studio, playing together in real time. This was substantially different from that of his contemporary Phil Spector, who typically created his \"Wall of Sound\" productions by making live recordings of large ensembles that used multiples of major instruments like bass, guitar, and piano to create the complex sonic backgrounds for his singers.\n\nIn 1993, former session singer Ted Fletcher introduced the \"Joemeek\" line of audio processing equipment. The tribute to Meek was due to his influence in the early stages of audio compression. The name and product line were sold to the American company PMI Audio Group in 2003. The current product line includes a microphone series called \"Telstar\", named after Meek's biggest hit.\n\nAfter Meek's death, the thousands of recordings he hid at his studio remained unreleased and preserved by Cliff Cooper of the Millionaires. Subsequent to his suicide in 1967, Cooper is said to have purchased all of Meek's recordings for £300 () . These recordings were called the \"Tea Chest Tapes\" among fans, as they were stored in a tea chest when Cooper took them out of his flat. Alan Blackburn, former president of the Joe Meek Appreciation Society, catalogued all of them in the mid 1980s.\n\nOn 4 September 2008 these unreleased recordings went up for auction in Fame Bureau's 'It's More Than Rock 'N' Roll' auction, fetching £200,000. They contained over 4,000 hours of music on 1,850 tapes, including recordings by David Bowie as singer and sax player with the Konrads, Gene Vincent, Denny Laine, Billy Fury, Tom Jones, Jimmy Page, Mike Berry, John Leyton, Ritchie Blackmore, Jess Conrad, Mitch Mitchell and Screaming Lord Sutch. The tapes also contained many examples of Meek composing songs and experimental sound techniques. Tape 418 has Meek composing songs for the film \"Live It Up!\".\n\nMeek passed up the chance to work with the then unknown David Bowie, the Beatles (the latter he once described as \"just another bunch of noise, copying other people's music\") and Rod Stewart. John Repsch, in \"The Legendary Joe Meek\" recounts that upon hearing Stewart sing, Meek rushed into the studio, put his fingers in his ears and screamed until Stewart had left. He preferred to record instrumentals with the band he sang with – the Moontrekkers.\n\nIn 1963 Meek worked with a then little-known singer Tom Jones, then the lead vocalist of Tommy Scott & the Senators. Meek recorded seven tracks with Jones and took them to various labels in an attempt to get a record deal, with no success. Two years later after Jones' worldwide hit \"It's Not Unusual\" in 1965, Meek was able to sell the tapes he had recorded with Jones to Tower (USA) and Columbia (UK).\n\nThe following Meek productions appeared on the British charts.\n\nIn later years, the interest in Meek's life as well as influence on the music industry, has spawned at least two documentary films, a radio play, a stage play and a feature film.\n\nA number of artists have made tributes to Meek in various ways:\n\n\n"}

He also proposes an \"Alternate Federal Reserve\" which would loan to community banks, small business, and individuals, as opposed to the Federal Reserve Bank, which, Wolfe contends, serves primarily the interests of the six largest banks. Wolfe is also a critic of the Affordable Care Act, saying that it is oriented primarily toward helping the insurance and pharmaceutical companies. Instead, he supports Medicare for All.\n\nWolfe took part in the New Hampshire \"lesser known candidates forum\" in December 2011. He qualified for the ballot in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, in which he received 246 votes, 0.4% of the vote total. In addition to New Hampshire, he qualified for presidential primary ballots in the states of Missouri, Louisiana and Arkansas.\n\nIn the Louisiana primary, Wolfe polled 11.83% which qualified him to earn a minimum of three delegates to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Following the primary, officials of the Democratic Party of Louisiana announced that Wolfe was ineligible for the delegates he had apparently won because, according to the party officials, Wolfe had not properly complied with the party's qualification requirements. In response, Wolfe filed a lawsuit against the party, disputing the claim that he did not qualify to receive the delegates.\n\nFollowing incumbent President Barack Obama's narrower-than-expected primary win in West Virginia, where convicted felon Keith Russell Judd finished a strong second as a protest vote, press began to speculate on the possibility of Wolfe, who lacks Judd's criminal record, possibly contending and even winning the state of Arkansas. A poll conducted by Hendrix College of Democrats in Arkansas's 4th congressional district showed Wolfe within seven points of Obama there. Wolfe finished second in that primary, garnering 41.6% of the vote. He filed a legal action to have delegates seated at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.\n\nWolfe contested the Texas Democratic primary, garnering 5.05 percent of the vote, winning one county (Borden County) and tying in another (Sherman County). No delegates were at stake in the contest.\n\nWolfe lost his court case one week before the convention, and as a result, neither he nor any other candidates other than Obama had their delegates seated.\n\nAfter Wolfe lost the primary, his name appeared on the ballot in Idaho without his knowledge, Despite this, he did not attain any votes\nBelow is a table of the results of primary competitions he competed in during the Democratic primaries.\n\nIn November 2015, Wolfe filed for the Arkansas presidential primary.\n\nBelow is a table of the results of primary competitions he competed in during the Democratic primaries.\n\nJohn Wolfe also announced a run for the United States Senate representing Tennessee on a platform of Universal Healthcare, increasing the minimum wage, the protection and expansion of social security and withdrawing from Syria.

Korihor was able to preach his views to the people because of the land's freedom of religion. These teachings alarmed the clerical government in Zarahemla, who felt that his views were dangerous to their society, as people had begun to ignore the laws of the land (which were based on the religious beliefs of their society). He attempted to preach to the people of Ammon, but the residents had kicked him out of Jershon. He also tried preaching in Gideon and he was arrested; before a high priest, during a hearing for his apparent blasphemy and for causing social discord, Korihor offered a speech in his own defense. Korihor was turned over to higher authority and later got into an argument with the chief judge and governor, Alma regarding the existence of God. Alma responded to Korihor's arguments, stating that all things testified that there is a God. Korihor finally demanded that Alma show him a sign from God or he, Korihor, would not believe in God. This culminated in Korihor being miraculously rendered deaf and mute, upon which Korihor confessed, in writing:\nKorihor begged for forgiveness, but Alma, sensing that Korihor would go back to his wicked ways, cast Korihor out. Korihor became a beggar and was later trampled to death by the Zoramites, a group who had separated themselves from the main Nephite society.\n\nKorihor's statements provide explicit arguments for atheism, which have been categorized as arguments for agnosticism, empiricism, secular humanism, and relativism. Perhaps because of the direct treatment that Korihor gives the topic of atheism, his words have been cited by skeptics as exemplary, while devotees cite his teachings in an attempt to inoculate their audiences against similar heresy. \n\nKorihor's argument was two-fold. First, that \"ye cannot know of things which ye do not see\", from which he extrapolated that there is no fairness or unfairness, no crime or sin, no cause for shame, and no eternal consequence of actions. In the absence of sin, the need for an atoning sacrifice and the ordinances and religious participation to connect people to that atoning sacrifice are obviated, and followers are instead encouraged to \"look up with boldness\", \"enjoy their rights and privileges\", and \"make use of that which is their own\". Second, Korihor hypothesizes that the only reason for perpetuation of orthodox beliefs is \"a foolish and vain hope\" on the part of believers, and, on the part of priests and teachers, a desire \"to usurp power and authority over [the people]\" and \"keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands\".\n\nHugh Nibley relates the name to Egypt, and states:\n\nNibley relates Korihor's name to Kherihor, a high priest at Thebes.\n\n\n"}

Encouraged by his ardently patriotic mother, Rosalie Ducrolay, named \"Madame Jullien\", he attempted a career in journalism, in 1790 becoming a collaborator on the \"Journal du Soir\". The following year, he became a member of the Jacobin Club, in which he became an opponent of war.\n\nIn the spring of 1792, Jullien was sent to London by the Marquis de Condorcet, at the time president of the \"comité diplomatique\" of the Legislative Assembly. There he served as a student-diplomat, becoming an intermediary between the more liberal English factions and the Girondists. Among those he met there were Talleyrand and Lord Stanhope. Returning to France that autumn, he was named \"aide-commissaire\"m and then \"commissaire des guerres\", of the army of the Pyrenees, in January 1793. He was soon transferred to Tarbes \"due to age\". He rejoined the army of the Pyrenees on April 16, entering Paris with them on August 4.\n\nJullien then became a protégé of Robespierre, and was sent by the Committee of Public Safety on a mission to several Atlantic ports, beginning on September 10, 1793. Charged with ensuring surveillance of the military situation and of Jacobin propaganda, he attempted to gain for himself a rapport with public feeling. In Nantes, on February 4, 1794, he wrote a letter to Robespierre in which he denounced Carrier. At Bordeaux, he stood in opposition to Jean-Lambert Tallien and his mistress, Thérésa Cabarrús. He left Bordeaux to return to Paris on April 24, 1794; there he was named to the Executive Committee on Public Instruction. On May 18, he returned to Bordeaux, to purify the municipality and the Jacobin Club and seek out hidden Girondists among the deputies.\n\nJullien would likely have become a major player in the Revolution had it not been for the execution, by guillotine, of Robespierre in July 1794. Made destitute, he was arrested on August 10 and sent to prison; he would be held at the \"maison de santé\" of Notre-Dame-des-Champs, and would testify at Carrier's trial. He disavowed his association with Robespierre and was released, through the intervention of his father, on October 14, 1795. Ten days later, the insurrection of 13 Vendémiaire was stopped.\n\nJullien next became one of the founders of the Club du Panthéon, returning to journalism with the creation of \"L'Orateur plébéien\", a democratic and moderate pamphlet, with Ève Demaillot and Jean-Jacques Leuliette. On March 13, 1796, Merlin de Douai helped him enter the Ministère de la Police, where he became responsible for lists of emigrans. He soon became suspected of Babouvist sympathies, and was forced to hide after the discovery of the Conspiracy of Equals in May 1796; he reappeared in October of the same year.\n\nJullien next joined the Army of Italy, becoming a writer for its mail service from August to November 1797. He then accompanied Napoleon I, in May 1798, on his journey to Egypt. There he became ill, and returned to France with Louis Bonaparte. Becoming well, he entered the service of general Championnet, becoming an adviser on December 28, 1798. Among the initiators of the Neapolitan Republic, he became secretary general to Championnet's provisional government on January 26, 1799. He was quickly recalled by the Directory, and was arrested on February 24. On March 12 he stood before a military tribunal, but was freed by the Coup of 30 Prairial Year VII on June 18.\n\nAccommodating the coup of 18 Brumaire to satisfaction, Jullien proposed a plan to unify the Italian states in July 1800. Immediately becoming indignant at anti-Jacobin proscriptions, following the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise he was relegated to handling administrative functions in Paris. He received the cross of the Légion d'honneur in 1803. After a visit to Madame de Staël at Chaumont-sur-Loire, through which he raised Napoleon's suspicions, he was sent to the Kingdom of Italy in 1810; while passing through Yverdon, he became acquainted with the Swiss pedagogue Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.\n\nIn 1813. Jullien was jailed due to his opposition to the Empire. Freed during the Bourbon Restoration, he published numerous opposition journals between 1815 and 1817, becoming known in the process as a pedagogue. He corresponded regularly with Pestalozzi, to whom he sent his first three sons, at Yverdon, and became a promoter of the Monitorial System of education. In 1819 he founded \"Revue encyclopédique\".\n\nJullien died in Paris in 1848.\n\nIn 1801 Jullien married Sophie-Juvence Nioche (died 1832); she bore him six children.\n\nThe eldest of the six, Pierre-Adolphe (born Amiens, February 13, 1803 - died 1873) was a technician, later becoming engineer-in-chief of the Corps of Bridges and Roads; in this capacity he oversaw construction of the Paris-Lyon railroad.\n\nAlso among the six, their daughter Antoinette-Stéphanie married the dramatist Lockroy and was the mother of Édouard Lockroy.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3434316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3434316", "title": "Michael Scofield", "text": "Michael Scofield\n\nMichael J. Scofield, portrayed by Wentworth Miller, is a fictional character and one of the two protagonists of the American television series \"Prison Break\". The character first appeared in the series pilot, in which he deliberately sends himself to prison so as to break his elder brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), out before his execution for a crime he did not commit. The storyline of the first season revolves around the two brothers and Michael's plan to help Lincoln escape his death sentence. Later seasons detail their life on the run and their quest for the truth behind Lincoln's imprisonment. As the principal character, Michael has been featured in every episode of the series. Although both Lincoln and Michael are the main protagonists of the series, Michael has been featured more extensively than Lincoln, especially in the first season and the third.\n\nVarious flashbacks from subsequent episodes provide further insight into the relationship between Michael and his brother, and the reasons behind Michael's determination in helping Lincoln to escape his death sentence. In the episode flashbacks, the younger Michael is played by Dylan Minnette.\n\nIt is later revealed that Michael has low latent inhibition, a psychological condition in which one sees the world as pieces, rather than mere objects.\n\nThe opening scene of the series shows Michael's final preparation of his plan to infiltrate Fox River State Penitentiary; a tattooist is applying the finishing touches to Michael's tattoo, which is prominently featured in the first season. In order to get into Fox River, Michael robs a bank at gun point and pleads no contest at his trial, and requests that he be sent to the prison nearest to his home. Michael begins his sentence on April 11, exactly a month before Lincoln is set to be executed. Once there, he scrutinizes every detail regarding the prison and its inhabitants.\n\nGiven Scofield's educational background, inmates and correctional officers alike would often wonder why a man of Michael's credentials would have thrown such a privileged life away to end up in a state penitentiary. Even more intriguing are his weird \"habits\"; he is often seen conversing discreetly with his brother during Prison Industry time and Chapel time; and the fact that he tends to execute a highly defined stare around Fox River's boundaries immediately from the point he got incarcerated as well as being called personally on command by the prison's warden himself, Henry Pope.\n\nThe season follows Michael as he puts his plan into action while overcoming various obstacles. In the first 13 episodes, Michael is seen to have a specific objective in each episode that he must accomplish in order to build an escape route out of the prison. On the way, he recruits a number of people to aid in the escape: his cellmate Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) to help him dig, mob boss John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare) to get him on PI (Prison Industries) and provide air transport once they escape, and Charles Westmoreland (Muse Watson), who he believes to be D. B. Cooper and can help finance their lives as fugitives.\n\nMichael feigns type 1 diabetes, giving him daily access to the infirmary (the escapees' exit point from the prison) and allowing him to build a relationship with Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), who happens to be the daughter of Frank Tancredi (John Heard), the Governor of Illinois. After agreeing to help Warden Henry Pope (Stacy Keach) finish his Taj Mahal replica in his office, Michael also forms a friendship with Pope. He also later stages \"brief insanity\" to gain access to the penitentiary's premises to gain contact with one of its insane inhabitants gifted with photographic memory, in order to re-acquire the portion of the tattooed blueprint that he lost after coming into contact with a steaming hot piece of metal.\n\nMichael's relationship with Sara is featured prominently in the nineteenth episode, \"The Key\", where he fails to steal the key to the infirmary from her. Although she finds out about his motive for being in the infirmary in the following episode, Sara decides to help Michael by leaving the infirmary door unlocked on the night of the escape. Towards the end of the season, Michael finally succeeds in helping his brother escape from Fox River State Penitentiary through the window of the infirmary, but also aids the escape of six other prisoners.\n\nIn the second season of the series, the story continues to follow Michael, his brother and other escapees as they try to evade the authorities pursuing them. Away from the prison setting, Michael and Lincoln are frequently featured in scenes together in the first seven episodes. Michael and Lincoln travel together, after the fugitives separate to accomplish each of their individual goals. When they fail to retrieve L. J. Burrows before his trial, they decide to head to Utah to find Westmoreland's hidden money. There, they reunite with four of the other escapees: Sucre, C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), T-Bag (Robert Knepper) and Tweener (Lane Garrison).\n\nThe seventh episode of the season, \"Buried\" marks the first time Lincoln and Michael separate, when Lincoln decides to go after his son, L. J., who has been released from prison. Michael fails to retrieve the money after being fooled by T-Bag. Nevertheless, Michael continues to execute his plan in order to meet the coyote at the 'Bolshoi Booze' location. Prior to leaving for 'Bolshoi Booze', Michael meets Sara at the location which he encoded in his messages to her inside the origami cranes. Thinking that she had declined his invitation to Panama, Michael goes to meet the coyote, who has the location of an escape plane to Mexico. There, Michael is reunited with Lincoln, Sucre and the brothers' father, Aldo Burrows (Anthony Denison).\n\nWhen Aldo is killed by Agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner), Michael and Lincoln decide to confront \"The Company\" and the conspiracy, and bid farewell to Sucre, who alights the getaway plane to Mexico. After a brief capture by Mahone, Michael and Lincoln are aided in their escape by Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein), who turns against The Company in an act of self-preservation. Kellerman takes them to Terrence Steadman, the man Lincoln is accused of murdering. Steadman's suicide forces Michael, Lincoln and Kellerman to find Sara since she holds the key to unlocking information that can expose the conspiracy. After Sara joins them, Michael, Lincoln and Kellerman head to Chicago, where Sara's father has hidden the information. On the way, Sara tells Michael that she has fallen in love with him and later in the same episode Michael reveals that he feels the same.\n\nWith the help of former Fox River warden Henry Pope, Michael and Sara succeed in getting the USB drive in Frank Tancredi's private locker. After leaving Kellerman behind, Lincoln, Michael and Sara soon find that the recorded conversation on the USB flash drive could not be used as evidence due to its modified time-stamp, and decide to blackmail Reynolds instead. When this also fails, Michael and Lincoln are forced to escape to Panama; they are also forced to leave Sara behind after she is arrested. Upon discovering that T-Bag is in Panama City, Michael decides to capture him, which he successfully does. When Michael returns his boat with Westmoreland's money to find Lincoln missing, he receives a call from Mahone, who demands the boat and the money in exchange for Lincoln's life. Michael outsmarts Mahone and escapes with Lincoln. At his new boat, Michael and Lincoln are reunited with Sara, who tells them that Lincoln has been exonerated after Kellerman's testimony.\n\nTheir happiness is short-lived when Agent Kim (Reggie Lee) arrives and threatens to kill Lincoln and take Michael to Sona, which causes Sara to shoot him. As the three flee from the scene with the police pursuing them, Michael and Sara separate from Lincoln and end up surrounded in a small isolated shack. After expressing their love for each other, they leave the shack. Unbeknownst to Sara, Michael confesses to Kim's killing and is arrested in her place. Michael is imprisoned at the Penitenciaría Federal de Sona (Sona Federal Penitentiary). Michael is the fifth member of the Fox River Eight to be arrested by the authorities, and the second not to die upon interception.\n\nIn the season premiere, Michael witnesses a brutal duel between inmates, the usual manner of settling disputes at Sona. He unintentionally makes an enemy of a convicted influential drug lord in the penitentiary, Lechero. Lincoln informs Michael that The Company needs him to break somebody out of Sona (James Whistler), and that they have taken Sara and LJ hostage to ensure his cooperation. He began to look for Whistler, only to find that he has a bounty on his head: whoever kills him can receive exoneration from the mayor of Panama City. As a result, Whistler had gone into hiding in the sewers. Eventually, he found him and successfully persuades Lechero to remove the bounty on his head.\n\nWith seven days to bust Whistler out of prison, Michael tried to take matters into his own hands and uses it to contact Sara and receive a coded message about her location. He relays this information to Linc, who unsuccessfully attempts to rescue Sara and LJ; Sara is apparently killed as a result. Michael then purposely shorts out the power, causing Lechero to call on Michael to fix it. Michael restores power to the prison and also manages to restore power to a previously broken electric fence. It is revealed that Michael fixed the fence so that the electricity will superheat a chemical that Sucre (who was hired as the new grave digger) sprays on it, as the heated chemical is able to melt steel.\n\nMichael spies on the Sona tower guards but is seen by the second one, due to the lens glare. He observed that at 3:13 p.m., there would be a glare which causes one of the guards to look over to the other side. After a small raid takes place, the prisoners are rounded up in the yard. Captain Hurtado questions Michael to the point that he unholsters his pistol and puts it to Michael's head. Whistler manages to intervene on Michael's behalf. With the help of Mahone, Michael concluded that by drugging one of the guard's coffee, they could distract that guard. As the escape plan continues Michael finally learns of Sara's death, which has a devastating impact on him. In a moment of weakness he seems to challenge Whistler to a duel death but this reveals to be only a diversion for the escape. This escape ultimately fails.\n\nWhen The Company decided to rescue Whistler themselves, Michael foils their plans but he was suspected of such an operation. At the end of the episode he is being escorted out of Sona and is kept in solitary, being interrogated. He evenly relented and told them about Whistler, who then revealed that Gretchen Morgan is in charge of the operation. Later Michael finds out the officers that were with Gretchen have been killed. Michael and Whistler are returned to Sona. It was then when they turned to a new escape plan, with the help of Lechero, and that is through an underground tunnel.\n\nLater in the tunnels with Mahone, Whistler and Lechero, he says they need braces to hold up the escape tunnel. Then, when part of the tunnel is about to fall, Michael puts a little piece of metal in to hold it up. Their escape plan was jeopardized with Sammy taking over Sona prison and investigating their escape, but Sammy was killed after the tunnel fell upon him. It is then revealed that Michael killed Sammy by taking out that little metal piece. McGrady joined the team in the escape. Later Michael, Whistler, Mahone, and McGrady escape from Sona, with Lechero, T-Bag and Bellick caught during the escape.\n\nMichael successfully tricks Gretchen into giving LJ and Sofia back safely. When a shootout begins out a museum in Panama, Michael grabs the gun from Linc's car and has Gretchen in his sights, but she escapes when police start to shoot at her. Later on outside the hospital, LJ gave him the same origami rose that Michael had given to Sara on her birthday. Fueled by revenge, he bids farewell to his family as he goes on a solo mission to hunt down Gretchen.\n\nIn the season premiere, Michael has tracked down Gretchen and Whistler to Los Angeles as he prepares to avenge Sara's death. When Michael has both Gretchen and Whistler at gunpoint, Gretchen reveals to him that she had lied about killing Sara Tancredi. Unsure whether or not to believe her, Michael contacts Lincoln and then Bruce. When both Michael and Lincoln get arrested, Don Self tells them that they can either bring down The Company and get Scylla (A key card that stores every bit of information about The Company – essentially their \"little black book\") or go to jail. They refuse and are bailed out by Bruce. Bruce takes them to Sara where Michael and she joyfully reunite. A hired assassin named Wyatt eventually hunts them down and tries to assassinate them at Sara's safe house. It is then that Michael and everyone decide to take Self's offer. They are joined by Mahone, Sucre, and Bellick in their mission. To blend in with the crowds, Michael gets his tattoos removed via laser surgery. Throughout further episodes, Michael is seen to be experiencing health problems, getting nosebleeds and suddenly clutching his head in pain. He hides these from Lincoln and Sara, but in the episode \"Safe and Sound\" Michael experiences a bloody nose that he could not hide from Lincoln. Michael tells his brother \"It's not a big deal.\" and Lincoln replies \"It was a big deal when you were thirteen...\" It appears that Michael shared the condition with his mother; she during her childhood had frequent nosebleeds that stopped but resumed shortly before she died at the age of 31 of a brain aneurysm. This death was a discrepancy that was never directly explained when she turned out to be alive later in the season, however based on a statement by the General regarding prior results of a surgery, and later information revealed about Michael's mother, the explanation of the discrepancy is subtly implied. Michael is experiencing nosebleeds for the first time since 13 and is about to turn 31. In the episode \"The Legend\", Michael is no longer able to hide his sickness as he collapses in the warehouse. Sara takes Michael to the hospital where the doctors diagnoses him with a hypothalamic hamartoma, advising that emergency surgery is required or he might die.\n\nUnwilling to go into surgery until they get Scylla, Michael receives temporary treatment from Sara and goes onwards with their plans to break into The Company. Although the group eventually succeeds in getting Scylla, Self betrays them and takes it for himself to try to sell it. Michael, however, had taken a small piece of Scylla and Self needs that piece to make Scylla complete. Self goes back to find Michael and shoots the warehouse and a gas tanker to try to force them out. Fortunately, Lincoln was not in the warehouse at the time, and upon discovering Self's car outside, he finds Self at the top of a building and knocks him unconscious. They bring Self in and are about to get Scylla when Gretchen holds the group at gunpoint, allowing Self and herself to escape. Everyone except Mahone head to the hotel Self and Gretchen are staying at. Michael tampers with the ladder outside so that when Self tries to escape, it comes loose and Self falls to the ground. Michael takes this opportunity to grab Scylla from an unconscious Self, but as he is running away his nose starts to bleed profusely. He begins losing his balance and blacks out, falling to the ground. Self then catches up and takes back Scylla. As he is preparing to shoot Michael, Company agents appear and start shooting at Self. Self jumps into Gretchen's van and they escape. The Company agents lift an unconscious Michael into their van and drive away, with Lincoln running after them.\n\nMichael is then shown in a hospital bed, connected to many machines. A hand rests on his, and it is revealed that this is General Krantz. Lincoln visits The Company's headquarters and asks General Krantz to allow him to see his brother. The General leads Lincoln to Michael, assuring him that Michael is under the best medical care and that The Company's technology is years ahead of those currently provided to the general public. He also tells Lincoln that the only way they will operate and save Michael is if Lincoln brings Scylla back. In addition, General Krantz gives Lincoln a folder labeled \"TOMBSTONE II\", telling him that it is \"added incentive.\" With Mahone arrested by Agent Lang and Agent Wheeler, it is now up to Lincoln, Sucre, and Sara to retrieve Scylla from Don Self and Gretchen and to save Michael.\n\nWith Sara by his side, Michael wakes up disoriented and weak. He asks her which hospital he is in, but Sara merely assures him he does not need to worry about it and that there are good doctors here to treat him. While Lincoln and Sucre go after Scylla, Sara stays with Michael and watches over him while he undergoes surgery. The procedure that The Company doctors use on Michael is nothing like anything Sara has seen before. General Krantz tells her that while the procedure is experimental, it has been used once before on a patient who ended up living a long and happy life. Because of the surgery, all of Michael's senses become active at the same time, causing him to have his life flash before his eyes. He suddenly sees himself back in his old cell at Fox River, with Charles Westmoreland greeting him. While conversing with Westmoreland and trying to figure out the truth behind Scylla in his subconscious, the Michael in surgery is dying and begins to flatline. The Company doctor injects an unknown serum into Michael as Sara panics and rushes to Michael's side, telling him not to give up. After finally realizing what Scylla really is and hearing Sara's voice, Michael wakes up.\n\nLater on, Michael tells Sara that he had a dream about Scylla, and he explains that Scylla is not actually The Company's little black book, but knowledge regarding a chemical combination that can produce energy equivalent to that of the sun's. Lincoln visits Michael shortly after, who is shocked to find out that Lincoln is willing to work with The Company to retrieve Scylla. He attempts to convince Lincoln to stop what he is doing and that The Company cannot be trusted, but Lincoln gives Michael the \"TOMBSTONE II\" folder and reveals to him that their mother used to work for The Company before she died, and that he is just \"following the family business.\" A preview after the season 4 finale shows Lincoln on the phone with Michael and says he will stop at nothing to get Scylla. Michael replies saying he will stop at nothing to stop Lincoln from succeeding.\n\nMichael and Sara are seen exiting a pizza restaurant when a Company assassin tries to kill them. They escape. They then bribe a truck driver to let them hitchhike with him, fearing police. He calls Lincoln and tells him he will stop him from getting Scylla and reveals that their mother is alive. The truck is eventually pulled over and searched for Michael and Sara, by an unidentified man. He pretends he does not see anything and he murders the truck driver, placing a phone call stating that he has them. Michael and Sara try to call Lincoln, but they lose the signal and the back lifter is stuck so they smash a vending machine to open the side door and they escape with the guy chasing after them. Michael kills him and takes a note from him asking who sent him. The guy's last words were, \"Not Krantz.\" He then dies.\n\nMichael and Sara stay at one of Sara's old friend, Deb's vacation apartment, with whom she went to med school. Michael and Sara check the note they took from their abductor. It reads: I10R4AZMS=I-10 near route 4 in Arizona Michael Scofield. The back side reads B2348ROCKWELL1630VS, which they do not understand. Michael texts Lincoln to meet up with him, but instead Mahone comes. Mahone asks if Michael can explain his plan against The Company and Michael refuses to, since Mahone is working with The Company. Michael learns that Christina ordered their abductor to bring them to her, but not kill them. This provides greater incentive to Michael to want to take down The Company. They head to Rockwell Avenue, where they find a car, gun, money,a cellphone and directions to a location they need to go. They head to an airport and check through a flight log list for the initials VS; they discover the name Vincent Sandinsky. They abduct Sandinsky and a car chase ensues. They are captured and Christina orders Michael and Sara to be killed; before they can be executed, The Company agents are killed by Lincoln, Mahone, and Self. Lincoln advises Michael to leave, but he refuses. Lincoln takes Sandinsky with him as a hostage. Michael and Sara, however, took Sandinsky's cellphone which reveals he and Christina used to be lovers. Also in this episode (Vs.) it is revealed Sara is pregnant with Michael's child.\n\nIn the next episode, \"S.O.B.\", Michael calls Lincoln and informs him that Sandinsky knows everything. Lincoln advises him to leave Miami, but Michael still refuses. Michael calls Christina and wants to meet with her to make an arrangement if he gets Scylla. She agrees, and, along with her men, heads to the warehouse where Michael and Sara are. They search the warehouse and Michael puts baggies filled with chemicals inside Christina's SUV and puts the air conditioning on, setting it to full. When Christina and her men return to the car, she starts it and when the heat hits the bags, the chemicals evaporate, suffocating the occupants. Michael and Sara take this opportunity to abduct Christina and tie her up and put her in the trunk. When she regains consciousness, and she reveals to Michael that Lincoln is not his brother. His real parents, who were Company agents, were killed. Aldo adopted Lincoln when he was three. She never loved Lincoln like she loved Michael. Michael says Lincoln was a brother more than she was a mother: She left, he stayed, he fed him, kept him off the streets and kept him in school. According to the writer of the episode, Karyn Usher, on the episode audio commentary, what she told Michael was in fact a lie. Christina does not want Michael to keep saving Lincoln. Michael demands to know where Lincoln is, and she does not answer until Michael attempts to torture her. She reveals the location at an Energy Conference. Michael leaves, leaving Sara to watch Christina. Michael meets Lincoln at the Energy Conference where the Indian Prime Minister's son, Naveen Banerjee, is assassinated by Christina's men. Lincoln and Michael reunite, whereby Michael reveals to Lincoln that Christina set them up. The police then pursue them.\n\nIn the episode \"Killing Your Number\", Michael is forced to save Lincoln from the clutches of his mother, or save Sara from the clutches of The Company. Michael is forced to try to kill his mother, but, when the gun is out of ammunition, Sara kills Christina, saving Michael. He manages to save both and hands Scylla to Paul Kellerman. After this Michael, Lincoln, Sara, Mahone, and Sucre are exonerated. After Sara and Michael have a thoughtful walk on the beach about the new baby coming, we see four years have passed and Sara and her child are in Panama. After her son, Michael, receives a temporary tattoo, she tell him that they are going to see his father. Sara, her child, Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone meet at a beach, and walk up to a grave labeled \"Michael J. Scofield\" and Sara places flowers (lilies) on Michael's gravestone.\n\nThe movie starts with Michael and Sara getting married. They have a celebration at a restaurant by the beach, which is interrupted by a squadron of FBI agents who pull up to the area. They arrest Sara for the murder of Christina Hamilton (Christina Scofield). The only footage they had of the scene was where you could only see Sara shooting Christina, but not Christina's gun. Sara ends up in prison right across from the General and T-Bag. Michael is not allowed to see Sara as the FBI suspect he is planning an escape. As Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone plan the escape, Mahone admits that he was approached to be an under cover for the FBI to get his job back.\n\nIn prison Sara is almost assassinated with rat-poison as General Krantz put a bounty of $100,000 on Sara. A man in the male prison tells T-Bag that his girl can do it for $40,000, however when her and Sara duel Gretchen comes in and kills Sara's attacker. When Gretchen figures out Sara is escaping, Gretchen tells Sara that she wants to come, and uses her saving of Sara as proof she can be trusted. In a secret code, Michael tells Sara to meet him at the chapel for the escape.\n\nMahone tells the FBI that Michael decided to parachute into the prison. As a dummy drops in by parachute Michael sneaks under the FBI agent's car who is in charge of preventing the escape. Sara and Gretchen try to get to the Chapel by starting a riot. In the midst of the riot Gretchen gets shanked by another prisoner. Sara and Gretchen quietly sneak to the chapel, however Gretchen gets caught without revealing Sara's location. Sara continues and meets up with Michael. They eventually get to the exit point, but when Michael's key card doesn't work as expected, he tells Sara to carry on without him. Michael grabs the generator wires and puts two together to knock out the power. The door opens, but Sara sees an explosion as she leaves. Sara is unable to speak and Mahone informs everyone he is gone and they need to leave. Upon leaving, Mahone shows Sara and Lincoln Michael's medical records that he did not have much longer to live, and gave them a DVD on which Michael expresses his love to them both as well as his unborn child.\n\nSeven years after his apparent death, Michael resurfaces in Yemen, held in Ogygia Prison. A photo of Michael is sent to Fox River Penitentiary, given to the recently released Theodore Bagwell. Taking the photo, Lincoln travels to Yemen, alongside old friend C-Note. Michael is shown to be under a new alias, Kaniel Outis, does not acknowledge Lincoln or C-Note, claiming not to know them. It is gradually revealed that Michael, along with a fellow prisoner named Whip, are undercover CIA operatives, but were betrayed by a mastermind agent known as Poseidon.\n\nThe character was conceived after Paul Scheuring, \"Prison Break\"'s creator, developed an idea by another producer, about a man who deliberately imprisons himself to break somebody out. From the initial proposal, Scheuring then justified the character and story by making him a structural engineer who worked at the architecture firm that had access to the prison's blueprints. The name was originally used in Roald Dahl's collection of short stories, \"Someone like you\", as Michael Scofield.\n\nMichael J Scofield is portrayed by Wentworth Miller. For most of the first season of the show, Miller utilized a limited range of facial expressions which generated both positive and negative criticisms. It was for this performance in the first season that Miller was nominated for a Golden Globe. \"The Washington Post\" criticized Miller's performance as being \"the most oppressive\" and how \"the actor apparently thinks it looks cool for him always to be scanning the surroundings...\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" recognized the numerous scenes the actor was present in by saying that \"it's Miller's show\" and on his performance, they stated that his \"Michael Scofield has the silky voice of a sociopath, the resigned stance of a long-distance runner, and the deadpan delivery of Macaulay Culkin at his Uncle Buck best.\" On the other hand, \"The New York Times\" commented that although Miller does not show a wide range of emotion, \"he projects an unflappable determination that confounds his fellow prisoners...\" Regarding his character, Miller says, \"First season, I think part of my challenge was to create, hopefully, a compelling character. But at the same time, there were so many things I could never show, because standing next to Abruzzi or T-Bag or Bellick, I could not afford to be vulnerable. I could not afford to crack a smile.\"\n\nIn the show's second season, the character of Michael Scofield shows a wider range of emotions as Miller explains, \"He's going to have some lighter, more colorful shades... now that he's off with his brother, around whom I think Michael is willing to show a side of himself that he's not with others, there's a lot more that I can explore.\"\n\nThe tattoo, which covers the entire upper body of Michael Scofield, is featured extensively in the first season of the show and to a lesser extent in the second season. It contributes a major part to the plot of the series, containing various details of the protagonist's plan to escape from prison and from the country. Incorporated within the tattoo are the blueprints of the prison in which the protagonists are incarcerated during the first season.\n\nWentworth Miller, who plays Michael Scofield, has commented that questions about the tattoo are amongst the most frequently asked questions when he is interviewed about the show.\nIn the first episode of season four, Michael refused to take any painkillers during a night-long session in which the tattoos were removed by laser.\n\nDesigned by Tom Berg and created by Tinsley Transfers, the tattoo took around five hours to be applied onto Miller. When the entire tattoo does not need to be shown, for example, in scenes where the actor is wearing a T-shirt, only the forearm pieces of the tattoo are applied.\n\nIn the series pilot, Michael's jail entrance form held by Bellick shows that the character was born on September 8, 1978 in Toledo, Ohio (and the date in the \"Prison Break: The Conspiracy\" game states July 2, 1972. The birthdate is inconsistent with the characters' dialogue in later episodes. In \"By the Skin and the Teeth\", Michael remarks to Lincoln that their fathers left them thirty years ago. Since the series is set in the year 2005, the birth date shown on the prop cannot be considered as canon. Thus Michael is 27 years old since last episode in Season 3, \"Vamonos\", took place on June 24, 2005. This is according to the expired one week ultimatum given by The Company to Michael for breaking out James Whistler. His age is stated by Lincoln for the first time in \"Five the Hard Way\" as 31, meaning all the facts above cannot be canon. It's also stated Michael is born in 1976 in the episode \"The Mother Lode\", but in \"Killing Your Number\" it's retconned to October 8, 1974.\n\nBefore imprisonment into Fox River State Penitentiary Michael lived at 440 West Ardmore Avenue, Apartment 11 Chicago, Illinois 60660.\n\nMichael is described as \"always scanning the surroundings\", and \"has the silky voice of a sociopath (and) the resigned stance of a long-distance runner\" and projected an unflappable determination that confounded his fellow prisoners, as, being close to Abruzzi or T-Bag or Bellick, he could not afford to be vulnerable or even appear human. Later, following the escape, Michael, now off with his brother, around whom Michael was willing to show a side of himself that he was not with the others; something that is lighter and more colorful. Michael often is outwardly taciturn and stoic, rarely allowing the dangerous element he's frequently surrounded by to penetrate his thoughts.\nMichael has been clinically diagnosed with low latent inhibition, a condition in which his brain is more open to incoming stimuli in the surrounding environment. As a result of this condition, he is unable to block out periphery information and instead processes every aspect and detail of any given stimulus. This, combined with a high IQ (as a psychiatrist explains) theoretically makes him a creative genius. His intelligence is well noticed even by his enemies e.g. with Mahone in Season 2 making various comments about Michael's intelligence, even holding a certain admiration to him after successfully breaking out of two prisons (Fox River and Sona). He is even offered a place in The Company.\n\nDue to a feeling of abandonment and abuse during childhood, Michael developed and has very low, or absolutely no sense of, self-worth. With the low latent inhibition, this has made him become very attuned to all the suffering around him. As a result of being unable to block out other people's suffering, he is extremely empathetic and altruistic towards other people's emotions; this explains Michael's desire to make huge sacrifices to help others – he is more concerned with other people's welfare than his own. This particular attribute is apparently the product of his detrimental experience during childhood, where, as a child, his abusive foster father would often beat him and have him locked up inside a closet; and by doing so, Michael's eyes begin to adjust to the darkened environment, allowing him to scan objects around him which he can use for his own convenience.\n\nMichael had a very strong moral sense and was cool and reasonable. He knew that if he or his allies turn to kill rather than subdue their enemies, they will gradually lose themselves and eventually everything. Bellick, \"T-Bag\", Whistler and overall Gretchen, all people with much blood on their hands are only alive or survived as long as they did because Michael spared them.\n\nMichael's enhanced creative ability allowed him to design a tattoo with a hidden blueprint of Fox River Penitentiary that normal people couldn't discern. Over the course of four months, Michael had specific sections of the prison tattooed onto his upper body, hidden within gothic imagery. Each part of his tattoo had to be precise, which provoked the tattooist's comment to Mahone about Michael being a \"detail Nazi\" and that the tattoo was \"some sort of inside joke\" that only he got.\n\nMichael was also shown to be meticulous and well-prepared as he used his knowledge and intellect to achieve each step of his escape plan. With time, however, Michael developed (or was possibly born with) improvisation techniques. Tossed into Sona, he developed an escape plan, which ultimately fails. The failure leads to another escape plan which Michael realizes is a threat to his and Lincoln's safety, and stops it. After he escapes Sona and brings down The Company Michael orchestrates from the outside a plan to break Sara out of prison in a relatively short amount of time. The plan is successful but costs him his life in the process. This event is present in the movie \"Prison Break: The Final Break\". Despite this, the return of \"Prison Break\" in 2016 casts doubt over his fate, with Garry Newman suggesting that this particular event in the straight to video film is likely to be ignored.\n"}
{"id": "1149684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1149684", "title": "Muhammad Abduh", "text": "Muhammad Abduh\n\nMuḥammad 'Abduh (1849 – 11 July 1905) (also spelled Mohammed Abduh, ) was an Egyptian Islamic jurist, religious scholar and liberal reformer, regarded as one of the key founding figures of Islamic Modernism, sometimes called Neo-Mu’tazilism after the medieval Islamic school of theology based on rationalism, Muʿtazila. He also wrote, among other things, \"Treatise on the Oneness of God\", and a commentary on the Qur'an.\n\nMuhammad Abduh was born in 1849 to a Turkish father and Arab mother in Lower Egypt (i.e. the Nile Delta). He also had Kurdish roots. His family was of the Egyptian elite. His father was part of the Umad, or the local ruling elite. His mother was part of the Ashraf. He was educated in Tanta at a private school. When he turned thirteen, he was sent to the Aḥmadī mosque, which was one of the largest educational institutions in Egypt. A while later Abduh ran away from school and got married. He enrolled at al-Azhar University in 1866. Abduh studied logic, philosophy and Islamic mysticism at the Al-Azhar University in Cairo. He was a student of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, a philosopher and Muslim religious reformer who advocated Pan-Islamism to resist European colonialism. Under al-Afghani's influence, Abduh combined journalism, politics, and his own fascination in Islamic mystical spirituality. Al-Afghani taught Abduh about the problems of Egypt and the Islamic world and about the technological achievements of the West.\n\nIn 1877, Abduh was granted the degree of 'Alim (\"teacher\") and he started to teach logic, theology and ethics at al-Azhar. In 1878, he was appointed professor of history at Cairo's teachers' training college Dar al-Ulum, later incorporated into Cairo University. He was also appointed to teach Arabic at the Khedivial School of Languages.\n\nAbduh was appointed editor and chief of \"al-Waqāʾiʿ al-Miṣriyya\", the official state newspaper. He was dedicated to reforming all aspects of Egyptian society and believed that education was the best way to achieve this goal. He was in favor of a good religious education, which would strengthen a child’s morals, and a scientific education, which would nurture a child’s ability to reason. In his articles he criticized corruption, superstition, and the luxurious lives of the rich.\n\nIn 1879, due to his political activity, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani was exiled and Abduh was exiled to his home village. The following year he was granted control of the national gazette and used this as a means to spread his anti-colonial ideas, and the need for social and religious reforms. He was exiled from Egypt by the British in 1882 for six years, for supporting the Egyptian nationalist revolt led by Ahmed Orabi in 1879. He had stated that every society should be allowed to choose a suitable form of government based on its history and its present circumstances. Abduh spent several years in Ottoman Lebanon, where he helped establish an Islamic educational system. In 1884 he moved to Paris, France where he joined al-Afghani in publishing \"The Firmest Bond\" (al-Urwah al-Wuthqa), an Islamic revolutionary journal that promoted anti-British views. Abduh also visited Britain and discussed the state of Egypt and Sudan with high-ranking officials. In 1885, after brief stays in England and Tunisia, he returned to Beirut, as a teacher, and was surrounded by scholars from different religious backgrounds. During his stay there he dedicated his efforts toward furthering respect and friendship between Islam, Christianity and Judaism.\n\nWhen he returned to Egypt in 1888, Abduh began his legal career. He was appointed judge in the Courts of First Instance of the Native Tribunals and in 1891, he became a consultative member of the Court of Appeal. In 1899, he was appointed Grand Mufti of Egypt, the highest Islamic title, and he held this position until he died. As a judge, he was involved in many decisions, some of which were considered liberal such as the ability to utilize meat butchered by non-Muslims and the acceptance of loan interest. His liberal views, endeared him to the British, in particular Lord Cromer; however it also caused a rift between him and the khedive Abbas Hilmi and the nationalist leader Mustafa Kamil. While he was in Egypt, Abduh founded a religious society, became president of a society for the revival of Arab sciences and worked towards reforming al-Azhar University by putting forth proposals to improve examinations, the curriculum and the working conditions for both professors and students. He travelled a great deal and met with European scholars in Cambridge and Oxford University. He studied French law and read a great many European and Arab works in the libraries of Vienna and Berlin. The conclusions he drew from his travels were that Muslims suffer from ignorance about their own religion and the despotism of unjust rulers.\n\nMuhammad Abduh died in Alexandria on 11 July 1905. People from all around the world sent their condolences.\n\nMuhammad Abduh argued that Muslims could not simply rely on the interpretations of texts provided by medieval clerics; they needed to use reason to keep up with changing times. He said that in Islam, man was not created to be led by a bridle, but that man was given intelligence so that he could be guided by knowledge. According to Abduh, a teacher’s role was to direct men towards study. He believed that Islam encouraged men to detach from the world of their ancestors and that Islam reproved the slavish imitation of tradition. He said that the two greatest possessions relating to religion that man was graced with were independence of will and independence of thought and opinion. It was with the help of these tools that he could attain happiness. He believed that the growth of western civilization in Europe was based on these two principles. He thought that Europeans were roused to act after a large number of them were able to exercise their choice and to seek out facts with their minds.\nHis Muslim opponents refer to him as an infidel; however, his followers called him a sage, a reviver of religion and a reforming leader. He is conventionally graced with the epithets “al-Ustādh al-Imām” and “al-Shaykh al-Muftī”. In his works, he portrays God as educating humanity from its childhood through its youth and then on to adulthood. According to him, Islam is the only religion whose dogmas can be proven by reasoning. Abduh does not advocate returning to the early stages of Islam. He was against polygamy and thought that it was an archaic custom. He believed in a form of Islam that would liberate men from enslavement, provide equal rights for all human beings, abolish the religious scholar’s monopoly on exegesis and abolish racial discrimination and religious compulsion.\n\nAbduh regularly called for better friendship between religious communities. He made great efforts to preach harmony between Sunnis and Shias. Broadly\nspeaking, he preached brotherhood between all schools of thought in Islam. However, he criticized what he perceived as errors such as superstitions coming from popular Sufism. As Christianity was the second biggest religion in Egypt, he devoted special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many a time he stood up to defend Copts. During the Urabi revolt, some Muslim mobs had misguidedly attacked a number of Copts resulting from their anger against European colonialism. Abduh also had meetings in Baghdad with the son of Baha'ism's founder and then spiritual leader, Abdu'l Baha, who he had a generally positive view of - although it was asserted by his students that he was unaware of the extra-Quranic religious scripture or status of Baha'ullah as a prophet in the faith and viewed it as a reformation of Shi'ism.\n\nAbduh's collected works have been compiled and published in five volumes by Muhammad Imarah.\n\nAt the age of 28 Abduh joined a Masonic lodge, the Kawkab Al-Sharq (Planet of the East). Its members included Prince Tawfiq, the Khedive's son and heir, leading personalities such as Muhammad Sharif Pasha, who had been a minister, Sulayman Abaza Pasha and Saad Zaghlul.\n\nA. M. Broadbent declared that \"Sheikh Abdu was no dangerous fanatic or religious enthusiast, for he belonged to the broadest school of Moslem thought, held a political creed akin to pure republicanism, and was a zealous Master of a Masonic Lodge.\" \n\nIn line with Masonic principles, Abduh sought to encourage unity with all religious traditions. He stated that,\n\n\"I hope to see the two great religions, Islam and Christianity hand-in-hand, embracing each other. Then the Torah and the Bible and the Qur'an will become books supporting one another being read everywhere, and respected by every nation.\" He added that he was “looking forward to seeing Muslims read the Torah and the Bible.\" \n\n'Abduh was asked why he and (his teacher) Afghani had become Masons. He replied that it was for a \"political and social purpose\".\n\nLike his teacher, Abduh was associated with the Bahá'í Faith, which had made deliberate efforts to spread the faith to Egypt, establishing themselves in Alexandria and Cairo beginning in the late 1860s. Rashid Rida asserts that during his visits to Beirut, `Abdu'l-Bahá would attend Abduh's study sessions. The two men met at a time when they had similar goals of religious reform and were in opposition to the Ottoman \"ulama\". Regarding the meetings of `Abdu'l-Bahá and Muhammad 'Abduh, Shoghi Effendi asserts that \"His several interviews with the well-known Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abdu served to enhance immensely the growing prestige of the community and spread abroad the fame of its most distinguished member.\" Remarking on `Abdu'l-Bahá’s excellence in religious science and diplomacy, Abduh said of him that, \"[he] is more than that. Indeed, he is a great man; he is the man who deserves to have the epithet applied to him.\"\n\n\nOther works by Muhammad `Abduh\n\n\n\n\n"}

They were remanded on bail, to return to the court on 10 January for a committal hearing.\n\nThe charges against the pair relate to the alleged leak of a document containing what purports to be a discussion between Tony Blair and George W.

It is alleged this document shows that Blair had to dissuade Bush from bombing Al Jazeera in Qatar.\n\nOn 10 January 2006 their defence lawyer was shown the secret Al Jazeera bombing memo and declared it posed no threat to national security. He vowed to have it made public by the court. The case would return to court on 24 January. \n\nThe trial was due to begin on 9 October 2006. However, on that date the judge ruled the hearing should be in secret.

They collaborated as a husband-and-wife team for thirty-five years, signing their pots \"Vivika + Otto\", regardless of who actually made them.\n\nOne of twelve children born of Finnish immigrants, Lena and August Heino, in East Hampton, Connecticut, United States. His family ran a dairy farm in quiet farm country. Otto Heino's involvement with ceramics began while serving in the U.S. Air Force in England; during a military leave, he spent several days watching Bernard Leach throw pots. Following his return to the US, he used his GI Bill funding in 1949 to study ceramics at the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts, in Concord, New Hampshire. There he met Vivika, his teacher, whom he was married to in 1950.\n\nDuring World War II, Otto Heino served five years of active duty in the USAAF where he briefly worked on engines at a Rolls-Royce factory in England. He was assigned to the 357th Fighter Group, the \"Yoxford Boys\", based in Leiston, Suffolk. Due to his knowledge of Rolls-Royce engines, T/Sgt Otto Heino served as a crew chief, maintaining the group's P-51 Mustang fighters. Although he worked on several Mustangs, Otto is best known for being the personal crew chief of Bud Anderson's P-51 Mustangs, all of which were named \"Old Crow\". Never once in 116 combat missions did Anderson abort or return early due to mechanical problems, something Anderson attributes greatly to the dedicated and tireless work ethic of Otto and the rest of his ground crew. Aside from being a crew chief, Otto Heino, at one point, served as a waist gunner in a B-17 Flying Fortress. He was shot down twice over Germany, escaping certain death largely due in part to his Teutonic name and appearance.\n\nOtto Heino died of acute renal failure at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, California on July 16, 2009.\n\nVivika was born Vivien Place in Caledonia, New York. In the mid 1930s, after getting a teaching degree at the Rochester Normal School, she spent two years with the Works Progress Administration theatre project, and headed the National Youth Administration in San Francisco. Discovering clay at this time, she studied at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute), and with Glen Lukens at the University of Southern California. Lukens, a highly respected ceramist renowned for his glazes, gave her the opportunity to explore colored clays, develop new glazes, and experiment with raw materials. (In later years, she and Otto were to devote a day a week to measuring, mixing, and testing new glazes.) Her pots were exhibited at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition, in San Francisco.\n\nVivien Place started using the name Vivika while studying at the Swedish Applied Arts, in San Francisco, where teacher Margaret Gravandar thought everyone should have a Swedish name. (Even her mother started calling her that.)\n\nIn 1941, Vivika received an M.F.A. from New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, Alfred, New York. She was the second M.F.A. graduate from the ceramics program there (following Daniel Rhodes in 1940).\n\nOtto and Vivika moved to California in 1952, where Vivika replaced Glen Lukens, head of ceramics department of the University of Southern California, during his sabbatical; she remained there for three years. Otto also taught at the university during this time. Also in 1952, she became a technical advisor for Twentieth Century Fox Studios, and she and Otto made 751 pots for the movie \"The Egyptian\" in 1953.\n\nIn 1955, as they prepared to return home to Hopkinton, New Hampshire, she was invited to reorganize the ceramics department at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, and remained there for eight years. During that time, they remodelled a store on Hoover Street into a studio and began selling their work directly to the public, with success. Otto worked full-time as a potter while Vivika taught; during the summer, they switched roles, Otto teaching and Vivika producing pottery.\n\nVivika helped organise and became a board member of the Southern California Designer Craftsmen, and later a trustee for the southwestern region of the American Craft Council. She travelled to nearby states to help organize craft groups, something she had experience with from her days at the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts.\n\nAfter an eleven-year stay in California (originally expected to last two), Vivika accepted in 1963 an offer to teach at the Rhode Island School of Design, in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1965, the Heinos reopened their home and studio in Hopkinton, New Hampshire.\n\nTeaching was a very important part of Vivika's life. Although he also enjoyed teaching, Otto preferred studio production. Over the years, Vivika accepted a number of short-term teaching assignments, punctuated by periods of studio work with Otto.\n\nWhat you give away you have forever; what you keep to yourself, you lose.\" (Vivika Heino)\n\nThey later returned to California, crossing the country in three moving vans, carrying 29 tons of materials. They purchased a house in Ojai, a small community in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles, built by Beatrice Wood, a friend since 1952. Their pottery studio, \"The Pottery\", produced functional and decorative vessels, as well as architectural commissions.\n\nThe Heinos supported themselves as potters throughout their career. Clean lines and distinctive glazes mark their work; avoiding ceramic trends, they focused on traditional and utilitarian pottery. Glazes, however, are Heino's greatest legacy. The yellow glaze being their most famous one. They were part of a generation that sought to redefine the relationship between ceramics and modern art.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "142610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142610", "title": "Robert Toombs", "text": "Robert Toombs\n\nRobert Augustus Toombs (July 2, 1810 – December 15, 1885) was an American lawyer, slaveholder and politician who became one of the organizers of the Confederacy and its first Secretary of State. He served in Jefferson Davis' cabinet as well as in the Confederate States Army, but later became one of Davis' critics, and only reluctantly returned to the United States after the Confederate defeat and regained political power as Congressional Reconstruction ended.\n\nA lawyer by training, Toombs gained renown as speaker in the U.S. House of Representatives, and later in the U.S. Senate. A slaveholder, he found common ground with fellow-Georgian Alexander H. Stephens and advocated states' rights and extending slavery. Toombs supported the Compromise of 1850, but later advocated secession. Toombs had always made a powerful impression on the public with his emotive oratory, backed by a strong physical presence, but his intemperate habits and volatile personality limited his career potential. In the newly formed Confederate Government, Toombs was appointed Secretary of State, but criticised the attack on Fort Sumter, which put him at odds with President Jefferson Davis (whose position he had coveted), and he quit to join the Confederate States Army. He became a Brigadier-General, and was wounded at the Battle of Antietam. In 1863, Toombs resigned his commission in the Confederate Army to join the Georgia militia. He was subsequently denied higher promotion and resigned, continuing to feud with Davis to the last. When the war ended, he fled to Cuba, later returning to Georgia. But he refused to request a pardon, thus sacrificing his political future.\n\nBorn near Washington, Georgia in 1810, Robert Augustus Toombs was the fifth child of Catherine Huling and Robert Toombs. He was of English descent. His father died when he was five, and he entered Franklin College at the University of Georgia in Athens when he was just fourteen. During his time at Franklin College, Toombs was a member of the Demosthenian Literary Society, which honors him as one of its most legendary alumni to this day. After the university chastised Toombs for unbecoming conduct in a card-playing incident, he continued his education at Union College, in Schenectady, New York, which he graduated from in 1828; he went on to study law at the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nShortly after his admission to the Georgia bar, on November 18, 1830, Toombs married his childhood sweetheart, Martha Juliann (\"Julia\") DuBose (1813-1883), daughter of Ezekiel DuBose of Lincoln County, Georgia. They had three daughters: Louisa (b. 1833), Sarah (Sallie) (1835-1866) and (Julia b.1838). The last survivor, Sallie Toombs DuBose married distant relative and lawyer Dudley M. DuBose and died shortly after the American Civil War as discussed below.\n\nToombs was admitted to Georgia bar and began his legal practice in 1830. He began his political career by being elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, where he served in 1838 but failed to win re-election, was elected again and served 1840–41, and again failed to win re-election but was again elected and served 1843–44. His genial character, proclivity for entertainment, and unqualified success on the legal circuit earned Toombs the growing attention and admiration of his fellow Georgians.\n\nToombs won a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1844, and would win re-election several times, serving in the lower chamber until 1853, when he won higher office. Toombs joined his close friend and fellow representative Alexander H. Stephens from Crawfordville, Georgia. Their friendship became a powerful personal and political bond that effectively defined and articulated Georgia's position on national issues in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. Toombs, like Stephens, emerged as a states' rights partisan, became a national Whig, and once the Whig Party dissolved, aided in the creation of the short-lived Constitutional Union Party in the early 1850s.\n\nAs most Whigs, Toombs considered Texas as the 28th state. Historian William Y. Thompson writes that Toombs was \"prepared to vote all necessary supplies to repel invasion. But he did not agree that the territory between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande was a part of Texas. He declared the movement of American forces to the Rio Grande at President Polk's command \"was contrary to the laws of this country, a usurpation on the rights of this House, and an aggression on the rights of Mexico.\"\n\nToombs and his brother Gabriel owned large plantations and operated them using slavelabor. Toombs also increased his personal slave holdings as his wealth increased. Toombs owned 6 slaves in 1840. By 1850, he owned 17 slaves. In 1860, he owned 16 slaves at his Wilkes County plantation, and an additional 32 slaves at his 3,800 acre plantation in Stewart County, Georgia on the Chattahoochee River.\n\nBy 1860, Toombs and his wife lived without any other family members in Wilkes County; in the census that year, Toombs owned $200,000 in real estate and personal property including slaves totaling $250,000. One of his slaves, Garland H. White, escaped just before the civil war and became a soldier and chaplain in the Union Army in 1862. Other slaves were freed by the Union Army. William Gaines (minister and community leader) and Wesley John Gaines (1840-1912) became church leaders.\nThroughout the 1840s and 1850s, Toombs fought to reconcile national policies with his personal and sectional interests. He had opposed the Annexation of Texas but vowed to defend the new state once it was annexed late in 1845. He also opposed the Mexican–American War, President Polk's Oregon policy, the Walker Tariff of 1846 and the Wilmot Proviso, first introduced in 1846. In common with Alexander H. Stephens and Howell Cobb, he defended Henry Clay's Compromise of 1850 against southerners who advocated secession from the Union as the only solution to sectional tensions over slavery. He denounced the Nashville Convention, opposed the secessionists in Georgia, and helped to frame the famous Georgia platform (1850). His position and that of Southern Unionists during the decade 1850–1860 has often been misunderstood. They disapproved of secession, not because they considered it wrong in principle, but because they considered it inexpedient.\n\nToombs objected to halting the spread of slavery into the territories of California and New Mexico and even the abolition of what John C. Calhoun had called the \"peculiar institution\" in Washington, D.C. He took the view that the territories were the common property of all the people of the United States and that Congress must ensure equal treatment of both slaveholder and non-slaveholder. If the rights of the South were violated, Toombs declared, \"Let discord reign forever.\"\n\nFrom 1853–61 Toombs served in the United States Senate, only reluctantly joining the Democratic Party when lack of interest among other states doomed the Constitutional Union Party.\n\nToombs favored the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, the admission of Kansas under the Lecompton Constitution, and the English Bill (1858). However, his faith in the resiliency and effectiveness of the national government to resolve sectional conflicts waned as the 1850s drew to a close.\n\nOn June 24, 1856, Toombs introduced the Toombs Bill, which proposed a constitutional convention in Kansas under conditions which were acknowledged by various anti-slavery leaders as fair, and which mark the greatest concessions made by the pro-slavery senators during the Kansas struggle. The bill did not provide for the submission of the constitution to popular vote, and the silence on this point of the territorial law under which the Lecompton Constitution of Kansas was framed in 1857 was the crux of the Lecompton struggle.\nThompson refers to Toombs as \"hardly a man of the people with his wealth and imperious manner. But his handsome imposing appearance, undoubted ability, and boldness of speech appealed to Georgians, who kept him in national office until the Civil War brought him home.\" According to Jacob S. Clawson, he was \"a bullish politician whose blend of acerbic wit, fiery demeanor, and political tact aroused the full spectrum of emotions from his constituents and colleagues...[he] could not balance his volatile personality with his otherwise keen political skill.\"\n\nIn the presidential campaign of 1860 he supported John C. Breckinridge, and on December 22, soon after the election of Abraham Lincoln, sent a telegram to Georgia that asserted that \"secession by 4 March next should be thundered forth from the ballot-box by the united voice of Georgia.\" He delivered a farewell address in the Senate (January 7, 1861) in which he said: \"We want no negro equality, no negro citizenship; we want no negro race to degrade our own; and as one man [we] would meet you upon the border with the sword in one hand and the torch in the other.\" He returned to Georgia, and with Governor Joseph E. Brown led the fight for secession against Stephens and Herschel V. Johnson (1812–80). His influence was a most powerful factor in inducing the \"old-line Whigs\" to support immediate secession.\nUnlike the crises of 1850, these events galvanized Toombs and energized ambitions for becoming the president of the new Confederate nation.\n\nThe selection of Jefferson Davis as the new nation's chief executive dashed any hopes Toombs had imagined of holding the high office of the fledgeling Confederacy. Confederate leaders rejected Toombs because of his serious drinking problem. He had no diplomatic skills but Davis chose him as the Secretary of State. Toombs was the only member of Davis' administration to voice reservations about the attack on Fort Sumter. After reading Lincoln's letter to the governor of South Carolina, Toombs said memorably: \"Mr. President, at this time it is suicide, murder, and will lose us every friend at the North. You will wantonly strike a hornet's nest which extends from mountain to ocean, and legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us to death. It is unnecessary; it puts us in the wrong; it is fatal.\"\n\nWithin months of his cabinet appointment, a frustrated Toombs stepped down to join the Confederate States Army. He received a commission as a brigadier general on July 19, 1861, and served first as a brigade commander in the (Confederate) Army of the Potomac, and then in David R. Jones' division of the Army of Northern Virginia through the Peninsula Campaign, Seven Days Battles, Northern Virginia Campaign, and Maryland Campaign. He was wounded in the hand at the Battle of Antietam where he commanded the heroic defense of Burnside's Bridge.\n\nToombs resigned his CSA commission on March 3, 1863, to become Colonel of the 3rd Cavalry of the Georgia Militia, and subsequently served as a brigadier general and adjutant and inspector-general of General Gustavus W. Smith's division of Georgia militia. He then launched a major attack on Davis and the government, opposed conscription and the suspension of habeas corpus, as newspapers warned that he verged on treason. In the last battle of the Civil War at Columbus, Georgia, Toombs commanded the defense of the upper bridge. When the war ended, he fled to Cuba, and then Paris, along with P.G.T. Beauregard and Julia Colquitt, wife of another Confederate general.\nHis beloved wife returned to Georgia in late 1866 following the death of their last surviving child, Sallie Toombs DuBose, in Washington County, Georgia, leaving her husband to care for several small children. Toombs missed his wife and returned to Georgia in 1867 but refused to request a pardon from the president and therefore regained neither his right to vote nor hold political office. However, he did restore his lucrative law practice, in connection with his son-in-law Dudley M. DuBose, who was elected a U.S. Representative and served one term. In addition, Toombs funded and dominated the Georgia constitutional convention of 1877, where once again he demonstrated the political skill and temperament that earlier had earned him a reputation as one of Georgia's most effective leaders. He gained a populist reputation for his attacks on railroads.\n\n1883 proved a privotal and negative year for Toombs, causing him to sink into depression, alcoholism, and ultimately blindness. As March began, his son-in-law Dudley M. Dubose suffered a stroke and died. His long-time political ally, former Confederate Vice-President turned Georgia Governor, Alexander H. Stephens, also died. By September, his beloved wife Julia died. Toombs died December 15, 1885, and was buried at Resthaven cemetery in Wilkes County, Georgia beside his daughter and son-in-law.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Natural Resources owns and operates the Robert Toombs House in Washington. Georgia also erected a historical marker in Clarkesville, Habersham County, Georgia concerning the Toombs-Bleckly House, which Toombs acquired as a summer residence in 1879 and sold to Georgia Supreme Court justice Logan E. Bleckley five years later, although it burned down in 1897. His great-great-grandson, Roderick George Toombs, became better known as professional wrestler Roddy Piper.\n\nThese locations were named for Robert Toombs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Retrieved on 2008-02-13\n (Transcription of 1892 text)\n \n"}

Mr. Dey is remembered as the man who pioneered and steered community development in independent India. He firmly believed that democracy cannot be practiced by government servants and stressed that the fruits of democracy ought to reach every village.\n\nS. K. Dey was born on 13 September 1905 in Laxmibassa village in Sylhet district in present-day Bangladesh, Mr. Dey went on to study engineering at world-renowned institutions- Purdue University and Michigan in the United States of America. Dey was a son-in-law of the eminent nationalist leader, Bipin Chandra Pal.\n\nHe began his career by serving as the Honorary Technical Advisor to the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Government of India (1948–51). It was in this post that Dey proved his mettle as a “social engineer” and was noticed by top government, including then-Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nDey’s vitality and commitment to developing grassroots democracy prompted Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to hand over the reins of Rural Development in newly independent India to Mr. Dey.\n\nAfter Nehru’s death, Dey resigned from the ministry and dedicated his time to build Panchayati Raj institutions in the country. As minister, his pet project was the Community Development Programme (1953) which would later form the basis of Community Development Blocks across the country. Mr. Dey’s concept of community development was rooted in his belief that the community could help itself rather than looking “towards the government as Mai-Baap.” Mr. Dey’s model of community development is characterized by a three-pronged strategy- development of the area, coordinated\nadministration and development of the individual and the community.\n\nThe first Community Development Project was undertaken in Etawah U.P in 1948. During 1952, 55 such projects were taken up across the country. Taking their success into account, the Community Development Programme was scaled up to all blocks in the country.\n\nIn 1949, Dey designed the concept of an agro-industrial township for rural development. The thrust of this model was its focus on a combination of agriculture and industrial development. The township would be provided support in terms of goods and services by surrounding villages. It would be self-sufficient and function on the basis of cooperation.\n\nThis model materialized as the “Mazdoori Manzil” project in 1950, in Nilokheri, Haryana. The project benefitted 7000 homeless refugees from Pakistan. Mr. Dey considered this model to be welfare state in action.\n\nImpressed with the model, Nehru termed it to be the “Mecca of Development” and called for the creation of many more Nilokher is across the country. Unfortunately, over the years, Nilokheri has been lost to obscurity and lacks evenbasic facilities such as health, water and education.\n\nS.K. Dey appears to have been influenced, on the one hand, by Rabindranath Tagore’s Shantiniketan experiment for Rural Development and, on the other, by the Gandhian idea of Rural Construction, which laid stress on self-sufficiency and manual labour. It could also be perceived as a Model of Rural Development based on a synthesis of Liberalism, Marxism and Gandhi-ism. The emphasis on individual liberty seems to have been imbibed from Liberalism, stress on right and duty to work from Marxism and that of small scale cottage and village industries from Gandhi-ism.\n\nDey was a member of the Balwantrai Mehta Committee (1957) that was set up to study the Community\nDevelopment Programme. The Committee assessed the extent to which the programme had succeeded in utilizing local initiatives and in creating institutions to ensure continuity in the process of improving economic and social conditions in rural areas. The Committee held that community development would be deep and enduring only when the community was involved in the planning, decision -making and implementation process, thus making a case for a strong Panchayati Raj system. The Balwantrai Mehta Committee proposed a seminal developmental role for Panchayati Raj Institution in rural development and termed these as necessary for the success of community development and national extension programmes.\n\nDey attributed philosophical connotations to the Panchayati Raj, which he explained in detail in his book “Panchayat-i-Raj, a Synthesis.” He elucidates that the Panchayati Raj was an important link between the individual and the world at large. Dey visualized an intimate relationship\nbetween the Gram Sabha and the Lok Sabha and said that democracy was to flow from the Parliament to the Gram Sabha. Dey urged state governments to give priority to establishing PRIs their respective states. By the 1960s, all states had legislated on PRIs and more 2, 17, 300 Panchayats had come into being.\n\nMr. Dey also played an instrumental role in the institution of the National Development Council. Mr. Dey’s has made a\nmarked contribution to the field of development journalism by being the guiding force behind “Kurukshetra”, the\nmonthly organ of the Ministry of Rural Development. Mr. Dey was a rare blend of a philosopher and practitioner who\nplayed an important role in the nation-building process for more than four decades after Independence. His\npioneering contribution to the concept and implementation of rural development and Panchayati Raj merits special\nattention from social scientists, administrators, political leaders and other stakeholders in the project for rural\ndevelopment and decentralized rural governance\n"}

The surname was and is often spelt Nordenfeldt, though Thorsten and his brothers always spelt it Nordenfelt, and the 1881 Census shows it as Nordenfelt. The family home in that year was Leinster Lodge on the Uxbridge Road, Paddington in west London.\n\nThorsten worked for a Swedish company in London from 1862 to 1866 and migrated to England in 1867 when he married Emma Stansfeld Grundy.\n\nThorsten Nordenfelt and his brother-in-law started a small business to trade Swedish steel for British rails in 1887. Later on he founded \"Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company, ltd\" to develop a machine-gun designed by Helge Palmcrantz that would be referred to as the Nordenfelt gun. His company also designed a range of anti-torpedoboat guns in calibres from 37 to 57 mm, that were produced in Erith, Kent, Stockholm and Spain. Under pressure from Rothschild and Vickers his company merged with Maxim's in 1888 to form The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company.\n\nAfter a personal bankruptcy Nordenfelt was forced out of the Nordenfelt-Maxim company in 1890 and left England for France, where his new company, Société Nordenfelt, designed the eccentric screw breech used on the French 75. Legal action followed (\"Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd\") over a non-compete clause Nordenfelt had signed.\n\nIn 1903 he returned to Sweden and retired.\n\nIn 1902 a public house named after Thorsten Nordenfelt was built at 181 Erith Road, Erith just along from the Gun and Carriage works of Vickers, Sons and Maxim (previously Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company) . Named 'The Nordenfelt Tavern' it was built to the design of Jonathan G. Ensor (1852/3-19??), architect for brewer Watney Combe & Reid\n\nDiscussions between Thorsten Nordenfelt and the English reverend George Garrett led to the production of a series of steam powered submarines. The first was the \"Nordenfelt I\", a 56 tonne, 19.5 metre long vessel similar to Garret's ill-fated \"Resurgam\" (1879), with a range of 240 kilometres and armed with a single torpedo and a 25.4 mm machine gun. It was manufactured by Bolinders in Stockholm in 1884-1885. Like the \"Resurgam\", it operated on the surface using a 100 HP steam engine with a maximum speed of 9 kn, then it shut down its engine to dive. She was purchased by the Greek Government and was delivered to Salamis Naval Base in 1886. Following the acceptance tests, she was never used again by the Hellenic Navy and was scrapped in 1901.\n\nNordenfelt then built the \"Nordenfelt II\" (\"Abdül Hamid\") in 1886 and \"Nordenfelt III\" (\"Abdül Mecid\") in 1887, a pair of 30 metre long submarines with twin torpedo tubes, for the Ottoman Navy. \"Abdül Mamid\" became the first submarine in history to fire a torpedo while submerged under water. Nordenfelt's efforts culminated in 1887 with the \"Nordenfelt IV\" which had twin motors and twin torpedoes. It was sold to the Russians, but proved unstable and ran aground off Jutland; when the Russians refused to pay for it, it was scrapped.\n\n\"Abdülhamid\" and \"Abdülmecid\" were in Istanbul in 1914. The submarines were briefly considered for use in harbour defence but it was found that their hulls were too badly corroded.\n"}

Her collection of writings, entitled \"Historical Sketches of the Cherokees, Together with Some of their Customs, Traditions, and Superstitions\", features historical accounts, legends, traditional practices, and stories that highlight aspects of Cherokee culture. Whanenauhi wrote the manuscript at a time when Cherokee acculturation into white society was heavily encouraged by her peers, and her work is often considered a backlash against that attitude.\n\nWahnenauhi was born in 1831 in Willstown, Alabama to Dr. Milo Hoyt, and Lydia Lowrey, a Cherokee woman. As a member of a Cherokee family with an elite social status, Wahnenauhi was well educated, and became one of the first students to ever graduate from the Cherokee Female Seminary in February 1855. Wahnenauhi came from a prominent family with mixed Amerindian heritage, and was related by marriage to Principle Chief John Ross. Her upbringing demanded that she both conform to the ideals of assimilation and maintain an intellectual connection to the traditions of her Indigenous heritage. This personal conflict had a major influence on her writings later in life, and Wahnenauhi joined other female indigenous activists like Nacissa Chisholm Owen and Sarah Winnemucca to reclaim traditional Indian practices through education and literature.\n\nWahnenauhi's manuscript entitled \"Historical Sketches of the Cherokees, Together with Some of their Customs, Traditions, and Superstitions\" is a sociological outline of many traditional Cherokee practices, teachings, stories, and histories. In September 1889, at the age of 58, Wahnenauhi sent her collection of writings to the Bureau of Ethnology (known today as the Bureau of American Ethnology) with a note offering her 70 page manuscript for editing and publication. In November 1889, the Bureau of Ethnology bought the rights to Wahnenauhi's manuscript for $10.00, and published her ethnographic record of the Cherokee people.\n\nWahnenauhi's work is considered a significant contribution to the American Indian traditionalist reform movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Her manuscript is contemporary with many other writers in the traditionalist reform movement, and takes on a preservationist philosophy through the re-telling of many of the old ways of the Cherokee peoples.\n\n"}
{"id": "40711240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40711240", "title": "Wills of Tadeusz Kościuszko", "text": "Wills of Tadeusz Kościuszko\n\nTadeusz Kościuszko (1746–1817), a prominent figure in the history of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the American Revolution, made several wills, notably one in 1798 stipulating that the proceeds of his American estate be spent on freeing and educating African-American slaves, including those of his friend Thomas Jefferson, whom he named as the will's executor. Jefferson refused the executorship and the will was beset by legal complications, including the discovery of later wills. Jefferson's refusal incited discussion in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Kościuszko returned to Europe in 1798 and lived there until his 1817 death in Switzerland. In the 1850s, what was left of the money in Kościuszko's U.S. trust was turned over by the U.S. Supreme Court to his heirs in Europe.\n\nIn 1798 Kościuszko decided to leave the United States and return to the Russian-controlled sector of Poland. His friend Thomas Jefferson provided him with a passport in a false name and arranged for his secret departure to France. Before leaving that same year (1798) he wrote out a will, which he entrusted to Jefferson as executor. In the document, Kościuszko, over six decades before the American Civil War, pleaded for the emancipation of America's Negro slaves.\n\nKościuszko left his American estate to buy the freedom of black slaves, including Jefferson's own, and to educate them for independent life and work. In September 1817, shortly before his death in October, he wrote a letter to Jefferson mentioning the bequest - \"...of which money, after my death, you know the fixed destination.\" Several years after Kościuszko's death, Jefferson, aged 77, pleaded his inability to execute the will due to age and the numerous legal complexities of the bequest. Jefferson recommended his friend John Hartwell Cocke, who also opposed slavery, to be executor, but Cocke also declined to execute the bequest. He wrote to Jefferson that there were \"prejudices to be encountered\" in their education and of \"an effect which might be produced on the minds of my own people.\" The federal court appointed an attorney, Benjamin L. Lear, to be executor of the estate. Lear died in 1832, the case still unresolved, and so his executor, Colonel George Bomford, became the executor as well of the Kościuszko estate.\n\nKościuszko had made a total of four wills, three of which postdated the American one. Within months after his death in October 1817, two other claims were made on his American estate; one by Kosciusko Armstrong and one by the Zeltner family, who had housed him immediately before his death. Both parties produced wills written by Kościuszko. A representative of the Russian government also made inquiries. The case of Kościuszko's American estate went three times to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1852 the Supreme Court awarded the estate to Kościuszko's heirs in Poland. Before the final Supreme Court decision, Gaspard Tochman, acting on behalf of Kosciusko's relatives, had found an 1816 will drawn up in Paris. This will, which revoked the one made in concert with Jefferson and the one concerning Kosciusko Armstrong, was authenticated. In light of the discovery, the Court ruled that the earlier wills treating his American assets were invalid and that these assets should be turned over to his closest living relatives.\n\nDuring the legal proceedings between his death and the Supreme Court's decision, the value of his estate decreased substantially; this was attributed by a case attorney to Colonel Bomford's use of the estate for his own purposes. In its 1852 ruling, the Supreme Court stated that the June 1847 value of his US estate was $43,504.40 and that only $5,680 could be found.\n\nNone of the resources that Kościuszko had earmarked for the manumission and education of African-Americans were ever used for that purpose.\n\nThe abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison later criticized Jefferson's inaction, as have Jefferson historians since the late 20th century, including Merrill Peterson, Gary Nash and Edmund S. Morgan. In his biography of Jefferson, Peterson wrote,The object of [Kosciuszko’s] will was lost. Had Jefferson felt stronger about the object, he would have ventured the experiment, despite statutory obstacles and the shortness of years, for the experiment [of freeing his slaves] was one he often commended to others and, indeed, one he may have himself suggested to Kosciuszko.\n\nThe subject was revisited in the early 21st century. Historian Henry Wiencek strongly criticized Jefferson's refusal of the executorship. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed countered that \"Kosciusko screwed up,\" that the will was \"a litigation disaster waiting to happen\", since Jefferson had learned there were later wills, and that Jefferson risked financial exposure. In a 2009 biography of Jefferson, Christopher Hitchens wrote that he \"...coldly declined to execute his friend's dying wish.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2312426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2312426", "title": "Yusuf al-'Azma", "text": "Yusuf al-'Azma\n\nYusuf al-'Azma (, ALA-LC: \"Yūsuf al-ʿAẓma\"; 1883 – 24 July 1920) was the Syrian minister of war in the governments of prime ministers Rida al-Rikabi and Hashim al-Atassi, and the Arab Army's chief of general staff under King Faisal. He served as minister of war from January 1920 until his death while commanding Syrian forces against the French invasion during the Battle of Maysalun.\n\nAl-'Azma hailed from a wealthy Damascene landowning family. He became an officer in the Ottoman Army and fought in multiple fronts in World War I. After the defeated Ottomans withdrew from Damascus, al-‘Azma served Emir Faisal, the leader of the Arab Revolt and was appointed minister of war upon the establishment of the Arab government in Damascus in January 1920. With little resources and support, he was tasked with building the nascent Arab Army of Syria. The country, meanwhile, had been designated as a mandatory territory of France, which did not recognize Faisal's government. Al-'Azma was among the more vociferous opponents of French rule and as their troops advanced toward Damascus from Lebanon, al-'Azma was authorized to confront them. Leading a motley army of civilian volunteers, ex-Ottoman officers and Bedouin cavalrymen, al-'Azma engaged the French at Maysalun Pass but he was killed in action, his soldiers were dispersed and the French occupied Damascus on 25 July 1920. Though his army was defeated, al-'Azma became a national hero in Syria for his insistence on confronting the French despite their clear military superiority and his ultimate death in the ensuing battle.\n\nAl-'Azma was born to a prominent mercantile and landowning Damascene family of Turkmen descent in 1883. Other members of his family also formed part of the Ottoman Syrian establishment; al-Azma's brother Aziz Bey served as a district governor while many of his relatives were Ottoman officers, including al-Azma's nephew Nabih Bey. Al-'Azma was married to a Turkish woman, with whom he had a daughter named Laila. Laila, who was a young child when al-'Azma died, married Cevad Asar, an Istanbul-based Turkish merchant with whom she had a son named Celal. Many members of the al-'Azma family in Syria later became bankers, landowners and merchants in post-Mandatory Syria and one member, Bashir al-Azma, served as prime minister of Syria in 1962.\n\nAl-'Azma graduated from the Istanbul-based Ottoman Military Academy in 1906 and was a member of the underground reformist Committee of Union and Progress. After graduating, he underwent additional military training in Germany until returning to Istanbul in 1909. There he enlisted in the Ottoman Army and promptly was assigned as a military attaché to Cairo, Egypt. In 1914, al-'Azma was Commander of the 25th Infantry Division during World War I. Later during the war, he was reassigned as a deputy of General Enver Pasha (Anwar Pasha) in Istanbul.\n\nToward the war's end, al-'Azma was appointed chief of staff of the Istanbul-based First Ottoman Army according to historian Phillip S. Khoury, or chief of staff of the Ottoman army in the Caucasus according to historian Ruth Roded. According to historian Michael Provence, it is \"widely believed\" that soon after this post, al-Azma joined the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans launched by Sharif Hussein of Mecca in 1916, \"but he actually served as a decorated Ottoman frontline officer until October 1918\". That month, Damascus was captured by the Arab Revolt's British-backed Sharifian Army led by Hussein's son Emir Faisal. Al-'Azma subsequently returned to Damascus. He joined al-Fatat, an Arab nationalist secret society founded in 1911, though it is not apparent when, and became a personal chamberlain of Emir Faisal. Unlike other ex-Ottoman officers from the empire's Arab lands who had hailed almost exclusively from modest upbringings, al-'Azma came from the upper urban class. In January 1919, Faisal appointed al-'Azma as Damascus' military attaché to Beirut.\n\nIn Prime Minister Rida al-Rikabi's government, al-'Azma was promoted to minister of war and on 26 January 1920 was also appointed Chief of General Staff by Emir Faisal to replace Yasin al-Hashimi who had been arrested by British forces and detained in Palestine. Al-'Azma's Damascene roots and reputation as a local and decorated Ottoman wartime general made him \"an obvious choice for minister of war\", according to Provence, despite having fought against the Arab Revolt months prior. During his time in office, al-'Azma established the foundations and hierarchy of the modern-day Syrian Army, according to historian Sami Moubayed. He gathered arms and ammunition left behind by the Ottoman Army in Syria, raised funds for new weaponry and by mid-1920, had created a military force of some 10,000 men, primarily consisting of Bedouin volunteers and former Ottoman officers.\n\nFaisal declared the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. However, in the secret 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement between the United Kingdom and France, the two powers negotiated the division of the Ottomans' Arab territories between themselves and the League of Nations gave France a Mandate over Syria in April 1920. Afterward, two principal camps emerged in the Syrian government; the minority faction favored a compromise with France due to its military superiority over the Arab forces (especially since the British withdrew their backing for King Faisal), while the majority faction rejected French rule by all means. Al-Rikabi led the minority faction while the majority camp was led by al-'Azma and supported by other young former Ottoman officers. Most of the Syrian government, including Foreign Minister Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar, backed al-'Azma's faction.\n\nFrench forces commanded by General Henri Gouraud had landed in Beirut on 18 November 1919. Gouraud was determined to bring all of Syria under French control and demanded the immediate deployment of French forces to the Beqaa Valley between Beirut and Damascus. Against King Faisal's wishes, his delegate to General Gouraud, Nuri al-Said, agreed to the French deployment. However, when a French officer was assaulted by Shia Muslim rebels opposed to the French presence, Gouraud violated his agreement with al-Said and occupied the large town of Baalbek. The French deployment along the Syrian coast and the Beqaa Valley contributed to unrest throughout Syria and sharpened political divisions between al-'Azma's camp and those who sought compromise with the French.\n\nIn northern Syria, an Alawite revolt led by Saleh al-Ali and a revolt in the Aleppo region led by Ibrahim Hananu were launched in response to the French presence. On 10 December 1919, Prime Minister al-Rikabi resigned amid pressure by the nationalists and popular opinion. The revolts derived military support from Mustafa Kemal's insurgents in Anatolia and from Faisal's government. In June 1920, al-'Azma toured northern Syria to recruit more soldiers into the nascent Arab Army and establish connections with the Anatolian insurgency. Al-'Azma sensed resistance to his conscription campaign particularly in Aleppo, but managed to gather some troops. French forces later occupied parts of northern Syria in early July 1920.\n\nOn 13 July, al-'Azma declared emergency measures in the Syrian National Congress, including press censorship, the power to seize civilian vehicles for military use and a call for militias across the country to support the army. Inspired by Kemal's successes against the French in Turkey, al-'Azma sought to follow in the latter's path in Syria. Meanwhile, Yasin al-Hashimi had returned to the country from Palestine and was tasked with inspecting al-'Azma's troops. He concluded that the Arab Army was woefully unprepared and under-equipped for a serious confrontation against the French Army. In a meeting of King Faisal's war cabinet, al-'Azma was visibly upset with al-Hashimi's conclusions. Regardless, he ultimately conceded that the army was in a precarious situation when informed that the lack of ammunition meant that each soldier would only be allotted 270 bullets for their rifle and each artillery piece could only be allotted eight shells. Despite this, all of the officers in the meeting declared their willingness to fight. According to Provence, both al-Azma and al-Hashimi \"complained bitterly that they faced an impossible task in organizing defense, made all the more difficult by Faisal's refusal to seriously contemplate and prepare for military confrontation\". In the struggle against France, both officers sought to implement the model of Kemal's Anatolian insurgency while Faisal continued, in vain, to seek an intervention by his erstwhile British allies.\n\nOn 14 July, France issued an ultimatum to the Syrian government to disband its army and submit to French control. On 18 July, King Faisal and the Syrian cabinet met and all ministers except for al-'Azma agreed not to enter into war with the French. After King Faisal ratified the cabinet's decision, al-'Azma withdrew his troops from Anjar, the hills overlooking the Beqaa Valley from the east, and the Beirut-Damascus road. On 20 July, six hours prior to the ultimatum's deadline, King Faisal informed the French liaison in Damascus of his acceptance of Gouraud's terms. However, for unclear reasons, Faisal's notification did not reach Gouraud until 21 July. Sources suspicious of French intentions accused them of intentionally delaying delivery of the notice to give Gouraud a legitimate excuse for advancing on Damascus. However, there has been no evidence or indication of French sabotage. When news of Faisal's submission to the French and his disbandment of Arab Army barracks in Damascus reached the populace, outrage ensued. A riot by soldiers and residents angry at King Faisal's decision was violently put down by Emir Zeid, resulting in some 200 deaths. Al-'Azma rejected demands to disband the army and implored King Faisal for an opportunity to confront French forces.\n\nAbout 12,000 French troops consisting of ten infantry battalions as well as cavalrymen and artillerymen backed by tanks and fighter bombers, began their advance on Damascus on 21 July. They first captured Anjar in the Beqaa Valley, where General Hassan al-Hindi's brigade had disbanded without a fight. The French advance surprised King Faisal who believed that French military action would be avoided by his agreement to the 14 July ultimatum as General Gouraud had promised. In response to Gouraud's action, King Faisal agreed to al-'Azma's request for mobilization. About 300 of Hindi's disbanded troops from Anjar were ordered to re-mobilize at the Maysalun Pass, some 12 miles to the west of Damascus. Al-'Azma managed to assemble a few hundred regular troops, and around 1,000 volunteers, including Bedouin cavalry.\n\nOn 22 July, King Faisal attempted to delay the French advance by dispatching Minister of Education Sati al-Husri to negotiate with General Gouraud, who laid out new conditions to prevent his army's offensive and gave King Faisal one more day to deliberate on the terms. The next day, while the cabinet considered Gouraud's conditions, the French requested entry into Maysalun to access its water. The Syrians interpreted the request to be an excuse for Gouraud's army to enter Damascus without a fight and King Faisal ultimately rejected Gouraud's request and his new conditions. Afterward, al-'Azma departed Damascus to confront Gouraud's army in what became known as the Battle of Maysalun.\n\nAl-'Azma's troops in Maysalun were mostly equipped with rusted rifles left by Ottoman troops and rifles used by Bedouin irregulars during the 1916 Arab Revolt as well as 15 cannons. The Arab force was composed of northern, central and southern columns with camel cavalry at the head. Al-'Azma led the central column which was backed by numerous civilian volunteers. Around dawn, at the approaches of Maysalun, clashes between Arab forces and the French Army took place, but most Arab resistance, which was largely uncoordinated, had collapsed by the first hour of battle. The Syrians had used up the little ammunition they had and the militarily superior French Army broke the Arab lines.\n\nAround 10:30am French forces reached al-'Azma's headquarters. The mines that had been laid by the Syrians did not explode or at least did not seriously hinder the incoming French forces. With French troops about 100 meters away from him, al-'Azma rushed to an artilleryman and commanded him to fire at the French tanks. Before any shell was fired, al-'Azma was targeted by a tank crew and shot dead by French machine gun fire. He was hit in the chest and head. Al-'Azma was the only Arab officer to die in the battle. Sporadic clashes continued for another three hours. By then, Arab forces had retreated in disarray towards Damascus. The French Army entered the city on 25 July. In his memoirs, General Gouraud wrote that after their defeat the Syrian troops left \"behind 15 cannons, 40 rifles, and a general ... named Yusuf Bey al-'Azma. He died a courageous soldier's death in battle.\"\n\nAl-'Azma's refusal to surrender to the French, his insistence on entering battle with inferior forces and his death commanding the Syrians in Maysalun made him a national hero in Syria and the Arab world. According to Khoury, al-Azma was \"henceforth immortalized by Syrians as the supreme national martyr\". Likewise, Provence states al-Azma \"became the supreme symbol of interwar Syrian Arab patriotism\". His statue stands in a major square named after him in central Damascus, with streets and schools named in his honor throughout Syria. Statues of al-'Azma are also present across the Middle East. According to historian Tareq Y. Ismael, the defeat of al-'Azma and the subsequent French takeover of Syria contributed to a popular attitude in the Arab world that exists until the present day which holds that \"the West is not honorable in its commitments, speaks with a forked tongue about issues of democracy ... and will oppress anyone who stands in the way of its imperial designs\".\n\nA tomb for al-Azma was erected inside a shaded grove at Maysalun in the 1930s. Though it has been frequently renovated, the original structure of the tomb remains largely intact. It consists of a stone sarcophagus elevated on a platform. One side of the platform has a stairway and the other side is a concrete column which carries a large concrete roof that is further supported by a beam. The sarcophagus has a triangular roof upon which is engraved the Zulfiqar sword. The Syrian military annually honors al-Azma at his tomb on Maysalun Day.\n\n\n"}
