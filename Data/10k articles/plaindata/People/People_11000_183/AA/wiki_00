He received a liberal education, studied law at Litchfield Law School and was admitted to the bar. In 1801 he married Sally (Sarah) Lawrence.\n\nGardenier practiced in Kingston, New York and was also editor and publisher of a Federalist newspaper, the \"New York Courier\". He was elected as a Federalist to the 10th and 11th United States Congresses, and served from March 4, 1807, to March 3, 1811.\n\nHe had a heated controversy with Senator John Armstrong relating to the latter's alleged authorship of the famous Newburgh letters, anonymous circulars in which the author (presumably Armstrong) had attempted unsuccessfully to instigate Continental Army soldiers to act against Congress at the end of the American Revolution in order to secure back pay, pensions and land grants that had been promised but were not immediately forthcoming. Armstrong denied writing the letters, but historians are of the view that Armstrong was the author. By the early 1800s Armstrong was a Democratic-Republican politician and follower of Thomas Jefferson, which caused the Federalist Gardenier to highlight Armstrong's supposed authorship of the Newburgh letters as a campaign issue.\n\nIn 1808 Gardenier fought a duel with George W. Campbell, a congressman from Tennessee, resulting from Gardenier's opposition to the Jefferson administration's trade embargo with Great Britain and France. Campbell was angered at Gardenier's speech, and in Gardenier's view included personal insults in his rebuttal speech. Gardenier challenged Campbell, and their duel was notable as being the first to be fought on what became the Bladensburg Dueling Grounds. Gardenier was wounded, but subsequently recovered and won reelection.\n\nFrom 1813 to 1815, Gardenier was District Attorney of the First District which included New York, Queens, Kings, Suffolk, Richmond and Westchester Counties.\n\nGardenier died in New York City on January 10, 1822.

{"id": "365785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365785", "title": "Bogeyman", "text": "Bogeyman\n\nBogeyman (; usually spelled boogeyman in the U.S.; also spelled bogieman or boogie man; see American and British English spelling differences) is a common allusion to a mythical creature in many cultures used by adults to frighten children into good behaviour. This monster has no specific appearance, and conceptions about it can vary drastically from household to household within the same community; in many cases, it has no set appearance in the mind of an adult or child, but is simply a non-specific embodiment of terror. Parents may tell their children that if they misbehave, the bogeyman will get them. Bogeymen may target a specific mischief—for instance, a bogeyman that punishes children who suck their thumbs—or general misbehaviour, depending on what purpose needs serving. In some cases, the bogeyman is a nickname for the Devil. Bogeyman tales vary by region. The bogeyman is usually a masculine entity, but can be of any gender, or simply be androgynous.\n\nThe word \"bogey\" is believed to be derived from the Middle English \"bogge\" / \"bugge\" (\"something frightening\", \"scarecrow\"). Theories on its origin include a root meaning \"goat\", or a cognate of the German \"bögge\", \"böggel-mann\" (\"goblin\"). It could be influenced in meaning by Old English -budda used in compounds for \"beetle\". \n\nThe word could also be linked to many similar words in other Indo-European: \"bogle\" (Scots), \"boeman\" (Dutch), \"Butzemann\" (German), \"busemann\" (Norwegian), \"bøhmand\" / \"bussemand\" (Danish), \"bòcan\", \"púca\", \"pooka\" or \"pookha\" (Irish), \"pwca\", \"bwga\" or \"bwgan\" (Welsh), \"puki\" (Old Norse), \"pixie\" or \"piskie\" (Cornish), \"puck\" (English), \"bogu\" (Slavonic), \"buka\" (Russian, бука), \"bauk\" (Serbian), \"bubulis\" (Latvian), \"baubas\" (Lithuanian), \"bobo\" (Polish), bubák (Czech), bubák (Slovak), \"bebok\" (Silesian), \"papão\" (Portuguese), \"торбалан\" (Bulgarian), Μπαμπούλας (Greek), ბუა), \"babau\" (Italian), бабай (Ukrainian), baubau (Romanian), and \"papu\" (Catalan).\n\nA related word, \"bugbear\", from \"bug\", meaning goblin or scarecrow, and \"bear\", was imagined as a demon in the form of a bear that eats small children, and was also used to mean a general object of dread. The word \"bugaboo\", with a similar pair of meanings, may have arisen as an alteration of \"bugbear\".\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the term is popularly supposed to refer to Bugis or Buganese pirates, ruthless seafarers of southern Sulawesi, Indonesia's third-largest island. These pirates often plagued early English and Dutch trading ships of the British East India Company and Dutch East India Company. It is popularly believed that this resulted in the European sailors bringing their fear of the \"bugi men\" back to their home countries. However, etymologists disagree with this, because words relating to \"bogeyman\" were in common use centuries before European colonization of Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Luo dialects in Eastern Africa the term 'bwogo' (with pronunciation sound like 'booga') means to scare. This correlation is most likely spurious as Nilotic language roots predate the modern concept of civilization itself.\n\nBogeyman-like beings are almost universal, common to the folklore of many countries.\n\nIn many countries, a bogeyman variant is portrayed as a man with a sack on his back who carries naughty children away. This is true for many Latin countries, such as Brazil, Portugal, Spain, and the countries of Spanish America, where he is referred to as \"el \"Hombre del costal\"\", \"el \"hombre del saco\"\", or in Portuguese, \"o \"homem do saco\"\" (all of which mean \"the sack/bag man\"), or el roba-chicos, meaning \"child-stealer\". Similar legends are also very common in Eastern Europe (e.g. Bulgarian \"Torbalan\", \"sack man\"), as well as in Haiti and some countries in Asia.\n\nEl Coco (also \"El Cuco\" and \"Cucuy\", sometimes called \"El Bolo\") is a monster common to many Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nIn Spain, parents will sing lullabies or tell rhymes to children, warning them that if they do not sleep, \"El Coco\" will come to get them. The rhyme originated in the 17th century and has evolved over the years, but still retains its original meaning. Coconuts (Spanish: \"coco\") received that name because their brownish hairy surface reminded Portuguese explorers of \"coco\", a ghost with a pumpkin head. Latin America also has El Coco, although its folklore is usually quite different, commonly mixed with native beliefs, and, because of cultural contacts, sometimes more related to the boogeyman of the United States. However, the term \"El Coco\" is also used in Spanish-speaking Latin American countries, such as Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, although there it is more usually called \"El Cuco\", as in Puerto Rico, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina. Among Mexican-Americans, \"El Cucuy\" is portrayed as an evil monster that hides under children's beds at night and kidnaps or eats the child that does not obey his/her parents or go to sleep when it is time to do so. However, the Spanish American bogeyman does not resemble the shapeless or hairy monster of Spain: social sciences professor Manuel Medrano says popular legend describes \"El cucuy\" as a small humanoid with glowing red eyes that hides in closets or under the bed. \"Some lore has him as a kid who was the victim of violence... and now he's alive, but he's not,\" Medrano said, citing Xavier Garza's 2004 book \"Creepy Creatures and other Cucuys\".\"\n\nIn Brazilian folklore, a similar character called \"Cuca\" is depicted as a female humanoid alligator. There's a famous lullaby sung by most parents to their children that says that the \"Cuca\" will come to get them if they do not sleep, just as in Spain. The \"Cuca\" is also a character of Monteiro Lobato's \"Sítio do Picapau Amarelo\", a series of short novels written for children which contain a large number of characters from Brazilian folklore.\n\nIn the countries of central and eastern Mediterranean, children who misbehave are threatened with a creature known as \"babau\" (or \"baubau\", \"baobao\", \"bavbav\", or similar). In Italy, the Babau (in Romania, Bau-bau) is also called \"l'uomo nero\" (Romanian: \"omul negru\") or \"black man\". In Italy, he is portrayed as a tall man wearing a heavy black coat, with a black hood or hat which hides his face. Sometimes, parents will knock loudly under the table, pretending that someone is knocking at the door, and say something like: \"Here comes \"l'uomo nero\"! He must know that there's a child here who doesn't want to drink his soup!\". It is also featured in a widespread nursery rhyme in Italy: \"Ninna nanna ninna oh, questo bimbo a chi lo do? Lo darò all' uomo nero, che lo tiene un anno intero.\" (English: \"Lullaby Lulla Oh, who do I give this child to? I will give him to the Boogeyman, who's going to keep him for a whole year\") \"L'uomo nero\" is not supposed to eat or harm children, but instead takes them away to a mysterious and frightening place. In Slovenia, the \"Bavbav\" is described as a formless spirit. In Greece and Cyprus, the equivalent of the Bogeyman is known as \"Baboulas\" (). Typically, he is said to be hiding under the bed, although the details of his story are adapted by the parents in a variety of ways. In Egypt \"al-Bu'bu'\" (البعبع) is often depicted as a night creature dressed in black who haunts children that misbehave.\n\nGermanic folklore has dozens of different figures that correspond to the Bogeyman. These have various appearances (such as of a gnome, man, animal, monster, ghost or devil) and are sometimes said to appear at very specific places (such as in forests, at water bodies, cliffs, cornfields or vineyards). These figures are called by many different names which are often only regionally known. One of these, possibly etymologically related to the Bogeyman, is the \"\", which can be of gnome-like or other demonic or ghostly appearance. Other examples include the \"Buhmann\" (who is mostly proverbial) and \"der schwarze Mann\" (\"the black man\"), an inhuman creature which hides in the dark corners under the bed or in the closet and carries children away. The figure is part of the children's game (\"Who is afraid of the bogeyman?\").\n\nIn Denmark, the creature is known as the \"bussemand\" or \"bøhmand\". It hides under the bed and grabs children who will not sleep. As in the English equivalent, \"bussemand\" is also a slang term for nasal mucus. In Norway, he is referred to as the \"Busemann\". In the Netherlands, the \"Boeman\" is portrayed as a creature that resembles a man, dressed completely black, with sharp claws and fangs. He hides under the bed or in the closet. The Bogeyman takes bad children or those that refuse to sleep and locks them in his basement for a period of time.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect, used in those areas of Pennsylvania colonized by Swiss and Germanic peoples during the eighteenth century, \"der Butzemann\" is the term for a male scarecrow. A female scarecrow is a \"Butzefrau\".\n\n\n\n"}

He exhibited a variety of paintings at the Royal Academy, but devoted much of his life to animal paintings.\n\nBriton's father, William Rivière (1806–1876), was for some years drawing-master at Cheltenham College, and then an art teacher at the University of Oxford. Briton was educated at Cheltenham College and Oxford, where he took his degree in 1867. For his art training he was indebted almost entirely to his father. His paternal uncle Henry Parsons Rivière (1811–1888) was also a noted watercolourist, exhibiting works at the Royal Watercolour Society, London and the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists.\n\nHis first pictures appeared at the British Institution, and in 1857 he exhibited three works at the Royal Academy, but it was not until 1863 that he became a regular contributor to the Academy exhibitions. In that year he was represented by \"The eve of the Spanish Armada\", and in 1864 by a \"Romeo and Juliet\". However, subjects of this kind did not attract him long, for in 1865 he began, with \"Sleeping Deerhound\", a series of paintings of animal-subjects which occupied much of the rest of his life. In a lengthy interview in \"Chums Boys Annual\", entitled \"How I paint animals\", Rivière explained some of the practicalities of painting both tame and wild animals:\n\nEarly in his career, Rivière made some mark as an illustrator, beginning with \"Punch magazine\". He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1878, and a Royal Academician in 1881, and received the degree of Doctor of Civil Law at Oxford in 1891. He was narrowly defeated in the election for President of the Royal Academy in 1896. His wife, Mary Alice Rivière (née Dobell; 1844–1931) whom he married in 1867, was a painter and exhibited briefly at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1869–70. After his death she presented the British Museum with four of his drawings (and an etching \"The king drinks\"), which complements the dozens of prints made after his work housed there, especially by Frederick Stacpoole and William Henry Simmons. The artist and his wife had seven children; five sons and two daughters.

{"id": "54761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54761", "title": "Chinese surname", "text": "Chinese surname\n\nChinese surnames are used by Han Chinese and Sinicized ethnic groups in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and among overseas Chinese communities. In ancient times two types of surnames existed, namely \"xing\" () or clan names, and \"shi\" () or lineage names.\n\nChinese family names are patrilineal, passed from father to children (in adoption, the adoptee usually also takes the same surname). Women do not normally change their surnames upon marriage, except in places with more Western influences such as Hong Kong. Traditionally Chinese surnames have been exogamous.\n\nThe colloquial expressions \"laobaixing\" (老百姓; lit. \"old hundred surnames\") and \"bǎixìng\" ( , lit. \"hundred surnames\") are used in Chinese to mean \"ordinary folks\", \"the people\", or \"commoners\".\n\nPrior to the Warring States period (fifth century BC), only the ruling families and the aristocratic elite had surnames. Historically there was also a difference between clan names or xing () and lineage names or shi (). Xing were surnames held by the noble clans. They generally are composed of a nü (, \"female\") radical which has been taken by some as evidence they originated from matriarchal societies based on maternal lineages. Another hypothesis has been proposed by sinologist Léon Vandermeersch upon observation of the evolution of characters in oracular scripture from the Shang dynasty through the Zhou. The \"female\" radical seems to appear at the Zhou period next to Shang sinograms indicating an ethnic group or a tribe. This combination seems to designate specifically a female and could mean \"lady of such or such clan\". The structure of the \"xing\" sinogram could reflect the fact that in the royal court of Zhou, at least in the beginning, only females (wives married into the Zhou family from other clans) were called by their birth clan name, while the men were usually designated by their title or fief.\n\nPrior to the Qin dynasty (3rd century BC) China was largely a \"fengjian\" (feudal) society. As fiefdoms were divided and subdivided among descendants, so additional sub-surnames known as \"shi\" were created to distinguish between noble lineages according to seniority, though in theory they shared the same ancestor. In this way, a nobleman would hold a \"shi\" and a \"xing\". After the states of China were unified by Qin Shi Huang in 221 BC, surnames gradually spread to the lower classes and the difference between \"xing\" and \"shi\" blurred.\n\nMany \"shi\" surnames survive to the present day. According to Kiang Kang-Hu, there are 18 sources from which Chinese surnames may be derived, while others suggested at least 24. These may be names associated with a ruling dynasty such as the various titles and names of rulers, nobility and dynasty, or they may be place names of various territories, districts, towns, villages, and specific locations, the title of official posts or occupations, or names of objects, or they may be derived from the names of family members or clans, and in a few cases, names of contempt given by a ruler. The following are some of the common sources:\n\n\nMany also changed their surnames throughout history for a number of reasons. A ruler may bestow his own surname on those he considered to have given outstanding service to him, for example the surname Liu () was granted by emperors in the Han dynasty, Li () during the Tang dynasty, and Zhao () from the Song dynasty. Others however may avoid using the name of a ruler, for example Shi () was changed to Shuai () to avoid conflict with the name of Sima Shi. Others may modify their name in order to escape from their enemies at times of turmoil, for example Duanmu () to Mu ( and ), and Gong () to Gong (). The name may also be changed by simplification of the writing (e.g. Mu () to Mo ()), or reducing from double or multiple character names to single character names (e.g. Duangan () to Duan ()). It may also have occurred through error, or changed due to a dissatisfaction with the name (e.g. , \"sorrow\", to , \"heartfelt feeling\").\n\nSurnames are not evenly distributed throughout China's geography. In northern China, Wáng () is the most common surname, being shared by 9.9% of the population. Next are Lĭ (), Zhāng (/) and Liú (/). In the south, Chén (/) is the most common, being shared by 10.6% of the population. Next are Lĭ (李), Huáng (/), Lín () and Zhāng (张/張). Around the major crossing points of the Yangtze River, the most common surname is Lĭ (李), taking up 7.7%, followed by Wáng (王), Zhāng (张/張), Chan/Chén (陈/陳) and Liú (刘/劉).\n\nA 1987 study showed over 450 family names in common use in Beijing, but there were fewer than 300 family names in Fujian.\n\nA study by geneticist Yuan Yida has found that of all the people with a particular surname, there tends to be a population concentration in a certain province, as tabulated to the right. It does not show, however, the most common surnames in any one province.\n\nThe 55th most common family name \"Xiào\" () appears to be very rare in Hong Kong. This is explained by the fact Hong Kong uses Traditional Chinese characters rather than Simplified Chinese characters. Originally, the surname (Xiāo) was rather common while the surname 肖 (Xiào) was extremely rare, if not non-existent (it is mentioned only sporadically in historical texts). The first round of simplification in 1956 simplified 蕭 into , keeping 蕭/萧 and 肖 distinct. However the second-round in 1977, which has long been abolished, merged 萧 and 肖 into 肖. Despite the retraction of the second round, some people have kept 肖 as their surname, so that there are now two separate surnames, 萧 and 肖.\n\nChén (/) is perhaps the most common surname in Hong Kong and Macau, where it is romanized as Chan, and is also common in Taiwan, where it is romanized as Chén.\n\nFāng (), which is only the 47th most common overall, is much more common in San Francisco's Chinatown in the United States, although the surname is more often than not romanized as Fong, as based on the Yue dialect. As with the concentration of family names, this can also be explained statistically, as a person with an uncommon name moving to an unsettled area and leaving his family name to large number of descendants.\n\nAfter the Song Dynasty, surname distributions in China largely settled down. The Kuàng (/) family, for example, migrated from the northern capital and settled in Guangdong after the Song Dynasty revolts. Villages are often made up of a single patrilineage with individuals having the same surname, often with a common male ancestor. They usually intermarry with others from nearby villages, creating genetic clusters.\n\nOf the thousands of surnames which have been identified from historical texts prior to the modern era, most have either been lost (see extinction of family names) or simplified. Historically there are close to 12,000 surnames recorded (including those from non-Han Chinese ethnic groups), of which only about 3,100 are in current use, a factor of almost 4:1 (about 75%) reduction. Surname extinction is due to various factors, such as people taking the names of their rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor's name, and others. A recent example of near surname extinction is the rare surname Shan (𢒉).\nThe character is not able to be displayed on a computer and people born after the system change as well as people who didn't want a hassle had to change their name to another character such as Xian (冼). The name still exists for those who were grandfathered but some people from the village are concerned that future generations will forget their name origin.\n\nWhile new names have arisen for various reasons, this has been outweighed by old names disappearing. The most significant factor affecting the surname frequency is other ethnic groups identifying as Han and adopting Han names. In recent centuries some two-character surnames have often dropped a character. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, moreover, some surnames have been graphically simplified.\n\nAlthough there are thousands of Chinese family names, the 100 most common, which together make up less than 5% of those in existence, are shared by 85% of the population. The three most common surnames in Mainland China are Li, Wang and Zhang, which make up 7.9%, 7.4% and 7.1% respectively. Together they number close to 300 million and are easily the most common surnames in the world. In Chinese, the phrase \"third son of Zhang, fourth son of Li\" () is used to say \"just anybody\".\n\nIn a 1990 study, the top 200 family names accounted for over 96% of a random sample of 174,900 persons, with over 500 other names accounting for the remaining 4%. In a different study (1987), which combined data from Taiwan and China (sample size of 570,000 persons), the top 19 names covered 55.6%, and the top 100 names covered 87% of the sample. Other data suggest that the top 50 names comprise 70% of the population.\n\nMost commonly occurring Chinese family names have only one character; however, about twenty double-character family names have survived into modern times. These include Sima ( , simp. ), Zhuge ( , simp. ), Ouyang ( , simp. ), occasionally romanized as \"O'Young\", suggesting an Irish origin to English-speakers, and Situ (or Sito ). Sima, Zhuge, and Ouyang also happen to be the surnames of four extremely famous premodern Chinese historical figures. There are family names with three or more characters, but those are not ethnically Han Chinese. For example, Aixinjueluo ( , also romanized from the Manchu language as Aisin Gioro), was the family name of the Manchu royal family of the Qing dynasty.\n\nTransliteration of Chinese family names (see List of common Chinese surnames) into foreign languages poses a number of problems. Chinese surnames are shared by people speaking a number of dialects and languages which often have different pronunciations of their surnames. The spread of the Chinese diaspora into all parts of the world resulted in the Romanization of the surnames based on different languages. As a result, it is common for the same surname to be transliterated differently. In certain dialects, different surnames could be homonyms so it is common for family names to appear ambiguous when transliterated. Example: 鄭/郑 (pinyin: Zheng) can be romanized into Chang, Cheng, Chung, Teh, Tay, Tee, Tsang, Zeng or Zheng, (in pinyin, Chang, Cheng, Zheng and Zeng are all different names). Translating Chinese surnames from foreign transliteration often presents ambiguity. For example, the surname \"Li\" are all mandarin-based pinyin transliteration for the surnames 黎 (Lí); 李, 理 and 里 (Lǐ); 郦/酈, 栗, 厉/厲, and 利 (Lì) depending on the tone which are often omitted in foreign transliterations.\n\nDue to the different pronunciation and romanizations, it is sometimes easy to tell whether a Chinese person has origins in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, or Taiwan. In general people who are Mainland descent will have both their surnames and names in pinyin. Those who are Taiwanese descent use Wade-Giles romanization. People from Southeast Asia (mainly Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines) and Hong Kong usually base their romanization of surnames and names on the Min, Hakka and Cantonese languages. The younger generation from Singapore predominantly have their surname in dialect and given name in English.\n\nThere are also people who use non-standard romanizations, e.g. the Hong Kong media mogul 邵逸夫 Run Run Shaw's surname 邵 is spelt as Shaw, pinyin: Shao.\n\nThe use of different systems of romanization based on different Chinese language variants from 1900~1970 also contributed to the variations.\n\nSome examples:\nMalaysia/Singapore/Indonesia/Philippines: various spellings are used depending on name origin.\n\nSee List of common Chinese surnames for the different spellings and more examples.\n\nThroughout most of Chinese history, surnames have served sociological functions. Because of their association with the aristocratic elite in their early developments, surnames were often used as symbols of nobility. Thus nobles would use their surnames to be able to trace their ancestry and compete for seniority in terms of hereditary rank. Examples of early genealogies among the royalty can be found in Sima Qian's \"Historical Records\", which contain tables recording the descent lines of noble houses called \"shibiao\" ().\n\nLater, during the Han dynasty, these tables were used by prominent families to glorify themselves and sometimes even to legitimize their political power. For example, Cao Pi, who forced the abdication of the last Han emperor in his favor, claimed descent from the Yellow Emperor. Chinese emperors sometimes passed their own surnames to subjects as honors. Unlike European practice in which some surnames are obviously noble, Chinese emperors and members of the royal family had regular surnames except in cases where they came from non-Han ethnic groups. This was a result of Chinese imperial theory in which a commoner could receive the Mandate of Heaven and become emperor. Upon becoming emperor, the emperor would retain his original surname. Also as a consequence, many people also had the same surname as the emperor, but had no direct relation to the royal family.\n\nThe Tang dynasty was the last period when the great aristocratic families, mostly descended from the nobility of pre-Qin states, held significant centralized and regional power. The surname was used as a source of prestige and common allegiance. During the period a large number of genealogical records called \"pudie\" () were compiled to trace the complex descent lines of clans and their marriage ties to other clans. A large number of these were collected by Ouyang Xiu in his \"New History of Tang\". To differentiate between different surnames, the Tang also choronyms before stating beforehand, for example Lǒngxī Lǐshì 隴西李氏, meaning Li of Longxi. These were generally the names of commanderies used prior to the reorganization during the Tang, so that they became exclusively associated to clans as their common use had died out. Cadet branches were also listed for further differentiation, such as Gūzāng Fáng 姑臧房, meaning Clan Li of Guzang. \n\nDuring the Song dynasty, ordinary clans began to organize themselves into corporate units and produce genealogies. This trend was led by the poet Su Shi and his father. As competition for resources and positions in the bureaucracy intensified, individuals used their common ancestry and surname to promote solidarity. They established schools to educate their sons and held common lands to aid disadvantaged families. Ancestral temples were also erected to promote surname identity. Clan cohesion was usually encouraged by successive imperial governments since it aided in social stability. During the Qing dynasty surname associations often undertook extrajudicial roles, providing primitive legal and social security functions. They played important roles in the Chinese diaspora to South-East Asia and elsewhere, providing the infrastructure for the establishment of trading networks. In southern China, however, clans sometimes engaged in armed conflict in competition for land. Clans continued the tradition of tracing their ancestry to the distant past as a matter of prestige. Most of these origin myths, though well established, are spurious.\n\nAs a result of the importance of surnames, rules and traditions regarding family and marriage grew increasingly complex. For example, in Taiwan, there is a clan with the so-called \"double Liao\" surname. The story is that \"Chang Yuan-zih of Liao's in Siluo married the only daughter of Liao San-Jiou-Lang who had no son, and he took the oath that he should be in the name of Liao when alive and should be in the name of Chang after death.\" In some places, there are additional taboos against marriage between people of the same surname, considered to be closely related. Conversely, in some areas, there are different clans with the same surname which are not considered to be related, but even in these cases surname exogamy is generally practiced.\n\nSurname identity and solidarity has declined markedly since the 1930s with the decline of Confucianism and later, the rise of Communism in Mainland China. During the Cultural Revolution, surname culture was actively persecuted by the government with the destruction of ancestral temples and genealogies. Moreover, the influx of Western culture and forces of globalization have also contributed to erode the previous sociological uses of the Chinese surnames.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive survey of residential permits released by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security on 24 April 2007, the ten most common surnames in mainland China are Wang (王), Li (李), Zhang (张), Liu (刘), Chen (陈), Yang (杨), Huang (黄), Zhao (赵), Wu (吴), and Zhou (周). The same names were also found (in slightly different orders) by a fairly comprehensive survey of 296 million people in 2006, and by the 1982 census.\n\nA commonly cited fact from the 1990 edition of the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" estimated that Zhang was the most common surname in the world, but no comprehensive information from China was available at the time and more recent editions have omitted the claim.\n\nThe MPS survey revealed that the top 3 surnames in China have a combined population larger than Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country. The top 10 surnames each have populations greater than 20 million; the top 22 have more than 10 million. The top 100 surnames cover 84.77% of China's population.\n\nNames in Taiwanboth among the immigrant ethnic Chinese and Taiwanese aboriginesare similar to those in southeast China but differ somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese. According to a comprehensive survey of residential permits released by the Taiwanese Ministry of the Interior's Department of Population in February 2005, the ten most common surnames in Taiwan are Chen (陳), Lin (林), Huang (黃), Chang (張), Li (李), Wang (王), Wu (吳), Liu (劉), Tsai (蔡), and Yang (楊).\n\nTaiwanese surnames include some local variants like Tu (塗) which do not even appear among the \"Hundred Family Surnames\". However, names in Taiwan show less diversity than China as a whole: the top ten comprise 52.63% of the Taiwanese population and the top hundred 96.11%. There were also only 1,989 surnames recorded by the Ministry's survey, against China's four or five thousand.\n\nAs is typical of China as a whole, these surnames conflate many different lineages and origins, although tradition may bind them to the same ancestral temples and rituals or ban intermarriage. For example, some Taiwanese converts to Presbyterianism adopted the name Kai (偕, pinyin \"Xié\") in honor of the Canadian missionary George Leslie Mackay (馬偕, Pe̍h-ōe-jī \"Má-kai\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

He worked primarily for Citytv as a weather reporter, before moving on to cover science and technology stories. Later on, he worked with the 24-hour news station CablePulse 24 as a news anchor and host of a weekly technology series, \"Home Page\". A published author, he was founding president of the Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Canada.\n\nHis seven-year term makes him the longest serving Lieutenant Governor of Ontario since Albert Edward Matthews (1937–1946) and the province's second longest serving viceroy since Confederation.\n\nOnley was born in Midland, Ontario, and raised in West Hill on Orchard Park Drive in Scarborough, now part of Toronto. He was educated at the University of Toronto Scarborough, served as student council president, and graduated with a degree in political science.\n\nBeginning at the age of three, Onley battled with polio, resulting in partial paralysis. However, as a result of extensive physical therapy, he regained the use of his hands and arms, and partial use of his legs. Onley is able to walk using leg braces and canes or crutches, but he generally prefers to get around using his electric scooter. He is able to drive a car using hand controls for acceleration and braking.\n\nOnley began his career in radio, hosting a weekly science show for Toronto radio station CFRB, subsequently joining the CKO network in 1983. He then joined Citytv in 1984 as weather specialist, a position he held until 1989. In a 2004 interview with Link Up, a Toronto employment agency for people with disabilities, Onley stated that \n\nFrom 1989 to 1995, he was the first news anchor on the then-new \"Breakfast Television\", Citytv's morning show. He served as education specialist for Citytv and CablePulse 24 from 1994 to 1999. Onley became an anchor on CP24, when the station launched in 1999, and both hosted and produced \"Home Page\" on CP24.\n\nHe was one of Canada's first on-air television personalities with a visible disability; he uses a mobility device due to his paralysis. Camera shots began with only upper body shots, but Onley demanded that the shot include him in his mobility device. In honour of his contributions to the advancement of disability issues in Canada, he has received awards from the Terry Fox Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Clarke Institute's Courage to Come Back award. He was appointed Chair of the Accessibility Standards Advisory Council to the Minister of Community and Social Services in 2005. He was most recently inducted into the Scarborough Walk of Fame in 2006.\n\nOnley wrote \"Shuttle: A Shattering Novel of Disaster in Space\", a bestselling novel about space travel, published in 1981. It was nominated by the Periodical Distributors of Canada as book of the year. He was founding president of the Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Canada.\n\nOnley returned to his acting roots, with a cameo appearance in the sixth season of the Canadian TV series \"Murdoch Mysteries\". The episode, \"The Ghost of Queens Park\" aired in Canada on February 25, 2013. In it he played the eighth Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Sir Oliver Mowat.\n\nOnley's appointment as Lieutenant Governor was announced on July 10, 2007; he was privately informed of this after a July 4, 2007, taping of \"Home Page\": \"I just had reached the top of the Don Valley Parkway... and there was no place to pull over. And when the Prime Minister of your country calls, all you can try to do is stay in the same lane, avoid any fender-benders and have a meaningful conversation, which I did.\"\n\nHe was sworn in on September 5, 2007, at Queen's Park in Toronto. As the province's first Lieutenant Governor with a disability, Onley said he would use his vice-regal position to help remove physical barriers to Ontario's 1.5 million people with disabilities, as well as focus on other issues affecting the disabled, including obstacles to employment and housing. Onley also stated, in his installation speech, that he would expand on his immediate predecessor James Bartleman's First Nations literacy initiatives, his aim being to see computers on every student's desk in northern schools. For his installation, Onley approached the legislature on his electric scooter, however he ascended the Throne on foot, using leg braces and canes. Onley also travelled to China to represent the Queen and Canada at the 2008 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony. Onley delivered his last speech from the throne to the Ontario Legislative Assembly on July 3, 2014; his last full day in office was September 22, 2014 with his successor sworn in the following afternoon.\n\nOnley and his wife resided in their Scarborough home during his vice-regal tenure, as Ontario is one of three provinces that does not have an official vice-regal residence.\n\nDuring Onley's mandate, he participated in 2550 engagements, during which he spoke to an estimated audience of over one million people.\n\nOnley was appointed as senior lecturer in the Department of Political Sciences at University of Toronto Scarborough, his alma mater. His appointment began on October 1, 2014. He also served as the University's Special Ambassador for the 2015 Pan American and Parapan American Games.\n\nHe is married to Ruth Ann Onley, a Christian music performer. They have three sons, Jonathan, Robert and Michael.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10576", "title": "Francis Ford Coppola", "text": "Francis Ford Coppola\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola (; born April 7, 1939) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter and film composer. He was a central figure in the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking.\n\nAfter directing \"The Rain People\" (1969), he co-wrote the 1970 film \"Patton\", earning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with co-writer Edmund H. North. His directorial prominence was cemented with the release in 1972 of \"The Godfather\", a film which revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, earning praise from both critics and the public before winning three Academy Awards—including his second Oscar (Best Adapted Screenplay, with Mario Puzo), Best Picture, and his first nomination for Best Director.\n\nHe followed with \"The Godfather Part II\" in 1974, which became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, it brought him three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture, and made him the second director, after Billy Wilder, to be honored three times for the same film. \"The Conversation\", which he directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. He next directed 1979's \"Apocalypse Now\". While notorious for its lengthy and strenuous production, the film is widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the Vietnam War. It won the Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to win two Palme d'Or awards.\n\nWhile a number of Coppola's ventures in the 1980s and 1990s were critically lauded, he has never quite achieved the same commercial success with films as in the 1970s. His most well-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish\" (both 1983), the crime-drama \"The Cotton Club\" (1984), the crime-drama \"The Godfather Part III\" (1990), and the horror film \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992).\n\nCoppola was born in Detroit, Michigan, to father Carmine Coppola (1910–1991), a flautist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and mother Italia Coppola (née Pennino; 1912–2004). Coppola is the middle of three children: his older brother was August Coppola, his younger sister is actress Talia Shire. Born into a family of Italian immigrant ancestry, his paternal grandparents came to the United States from Bernalda, Basilicata. His maternal grandfather, popular Italian composer Francesco Pennino, immigrated from Naples, Italy. Coppola received his middle name in honor of Henry Ford, not only because he was born in the Henry Ford Hospital but also because of his musician-father's association with the automobile manufacturer. At the time of Coppola's birth, his father was a flautist as well as arranger and assistant orchestra director for \"The Ford Sunday Evening Hour\", an hour-long concert music radio series sponsored by the Ford Motor Company. Two years after Coppola's birth, his father was named principal flautist for the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and the family moved to New York, settling in Woodside, Queens, where Coppola spent the remainder of his childhood.\n\nHaving contracted polio as a boy, Coppola was bedridden for large periods of his childhood, allowing him to indulge his imagination with homemade puppet theater productions. Reading \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" at age 15 was instrumental in developing his interest in theater. Eager to be involved in film-craft, he created 8mm features edited from home movies with such titles as \"The Rich Millionaire\" and \"The Lost Wallet.\" As a child, Coppola was a mediocre student, but he was so interested in technology and engineering that his friends nicknamed him \"Science\". Trained initially for a career in music, he became proficient on the tuba and won a music scholarship to the New York Military Academy. Overall, Coppola attended 23 other schools before he eventually graduated from Great Neck High School. He entered Hofstra College in 1955 with a major in theater arts. There he was awarded a scholarship in playwriting. This furthered his interest in directing theater despite the disapproval of his father, who wanted him to study engineering. Coppola was profoundly impressed after seeing Sergei Eisenstein's \"\", especially with the movie's quality of editing. It was at this time Coppola decided he would go into cinema rather than theater. Coppola says he was tremendously influenced to become a writer early on by his brother, August, in whose footsteps he would also follow by attending both of his brother's alma maters: Hofstra and UCLA. Coppola also gives credit to the work of Elia Kazan and for its influence on him as a director. Amongst Coppola's classmates at Hofstra were James Caan, Lainie Kazan and radio artist Joe Frank. He later cast Lainie Kazan in \"One from the Heart\" and Caan in \"The Rain People\" and \"The Godfather\".\n\nWhile pursuing his bachelor's degree, Coppola was elected president of the university's drama group, The Green Wig, and its musical comedy club, the Kaleidoscopians. He then merged the two into The Spectrum Players and under his leadership, they staged a new production each week. Coppola also founded the cinema workshop at Hofstra and contributed prolifically to the campus literary magazine. He won three D. H. Lawrence Awards for theatrical production and direction and received a Beckerman Award for his outstanding contributions to the school's theater arts division. While a graduate student, one of his teachers was Dorothy Arzner, whose encouragement Coppola later acknowledged as pivotal to his film career.\n\nAfter earning his theater arts degree from Hofstra in 1960, Coppola enrolled in UCLA Film School for graduate work in film. There he directed a short horror film called \"The Two Christophers\", inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's \"William Wilson\", and \"Ayamonn the Terrible\", a film about a sculptor's nightmares coming to life, before directing the experimental softcore comedy \"Tonight for Sure\" in 1962.\n\nAt UCLA, Coppola met Jim Morrison. He later used Morrison's song \"The End\" in \"Apocalypse Now\".\n\nThe company that hired him for \"Tonight for Sure\" brought him back to re-cut a German film titled \"Mit Eva fing die Sünde an\" directed by Fritz Umgelter. He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for \"The Bellboy and the Playgirls\", also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by Roger Corman and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, \"Nebo zovyot\", which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled \"Battle Beyond the Sun\", released in 1962. Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on \"Tower of London\" (1962), sound man for \"The Young Racers\" (1963) and associate producer of \"The Terror\" (1963).\n\nWhile on location in Ireland for \"The Young Racers\" in 1963, Corman, ever alert for an opportunity to produce a decent movie on a shoestring budget, persuaded Coppola to make a low-budget horror movie with funds left over from the movie. Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night, incorporating elements from Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", and the result impressed Corman enough to give him the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights), Coppola directed in a period of nine days \"Dementia 13\", his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a cult film among horror buffs. It was on the sets of \"Dementia 13\" that he met his future wife Eleanor Jessie Neil.\n\nIn 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (\"Pilma, Pilma\") written by a UCLA student. This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with Seven Arts. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for \"This Property Is Condemned\" (1966) and \"Is Paris Burning?\" (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the David Benedictus novel \"You're a Big Boy Now\" and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in \"You're a Big Boy Now\" (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via Warner Bros. This movie brought him some critical acclaim and eventually his Master of Fine Arts Degree from UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in 1967.\n\nFollowing the success of \"You're a Big Boy Now\", Coppola was offered the reins of the movie version of the Broadway musical \"Finian's Rainbow\", starring Petula Clark in her first American film and veteran Fred Astaire. Producer Jack L. Warner was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, \"hippie\" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the Napa Valley for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, but his work with Clark no doubt contributed to her Golden Globe Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him George Lucas, who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film \"The Rain People\" in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie. The film won the Golden Shell at the 1969 San Sebastian Film Festival.\n\nIn 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio \"Zoetrope\" after receiving a gift of zoetropes from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture-making equipment. While touring Europe, Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in Marin County to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for Zoetrope Studio became a warehouse in San Francisco on Folsom Street. The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of HDTV. In his book \"The American Cinema\", Andrew Sarris wrote, \"[Coppola] is probably the first reasonably talented and sensibly adaptable directorial talent to emerge from a university curriculum in film-making... [He] may be heard from more decisively in the future.\"\n\nCoppola epitomized a group of filmmakers known as the \"New Hollywood\" that emerged in the early 1970s with ideas that challenged conventional film-making. The group included Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Terrence Malick, Robert Altman, Woody Allen, William Friedkin, Philip Kaufman and George Lucas.\n\nCoppola co-wrote the script for \"Patton\" in 1970 along with Edmund H. North. This earned him his first Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince Franklin J. Schaffner that the opening scene would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview:\n\"When the title role was offered to George C. Scott, he remembered having read Coppola's screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola's script. 'Scott is the one who resurrected my version,' says Coppola.\"\nThe movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military \"Pep Talk\" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge American flag. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an R rating; in the opening monologue, the word \"fornicating\" replaced \"fucking\" when criticizing \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Over the years, this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows.\n\nThe release of \"The Godfather\" in 1972 was a milestone in cinema. The near 3-hour-long epic, which chronicled the saga of the Corleone family, received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and fetched Coppola the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, which he shared with Mario Puzo and two Golden Globe Awards: for Best Director and Best Screenplay. However, Coppola faced several difficulties while filming \"The Godfather\". He was not Paramount's first choice to direct the movie; Italian director Sergio Leone was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, \"Once Upon a Time in America\". Peter Bogdanovich was then approached but he also declined the offer and made \"What's Up, Doc?\" instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast Edward G. Robinson in the lead had he accepted the film. According to Robert Evans, head of Paramount Pictures at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his Sicilian and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, \"smell the spaghetti\". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.\n\nThere was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, though Paramount wanted either Ernest Borgnine or Danny Thomas. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that \"Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture\". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets). Coppola chose Brando over Ernest Borgnine on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an Academy Award for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:\nAfter it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In addition, it was ranked third, behind \"Citizen Kane\", and \"Casablanca\" on the initial AFI's 100 Years…100 Movies list by the American Film Institute. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008. Director Stanley Kubrick believed that \"The Godfather\" was possibly the greatest movie ever made and had without question the best cast.\n\nCoppola's next film, \"The Conversation\", further cemented his position as one of the most talented auteurs of Hollywood. The movie was partly influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni's \"Blowup\" (1966) and generated much interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the Nixon administration used to spy on political opponents prior to the Watergate scandal. Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental. The script for \"The Conversation,\" was completed in the mid-1960s (before the election of Richard Nixon); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fallout. The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDuring the filming of \"The Conversation\", Coppola wrote the screenplay for \"The Great Gatsby\". However, in the commentary track to the DVD of \"The Godfather\" Coppola states, \"I don't think that script was [actually] made.\"\n\nCoppola shot \"The Godfather Part II\" parallel to \"The Conversation\" and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in Technicolor. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: \"You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work\", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young Vito Corleone and the other of his son Michael. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie \"The Godfather Part II\". According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen \"The Godfather\", there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of \"The Godfather Part II\" began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director.\n\n\"The Godfather Part II\" is ranked as the #1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's \"50 Best Movies of All Time\" and is ranked at #7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\". The film is also featured on movie critic Leonard Maltin's list of the \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\", as well as Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies\" list. It was also featured on Sight & Sound's list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at #4.\n\nCoppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year. Victor Fleming was the first in 1939 with \"Gone with the Wind\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\"; Alfred Hitchcock repeated the feat the next year with \"Foreign Correspondent\" and \"Rebecca\". Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: Herbert Ross in 1977 with \"The Goodbye Girl\" and \"The Turning Point\", and Steven Soderbergh in 2000 with \"Erin Brockovich\" and \"Traffic\". Coppola, however, is the only one to have produced the pictures.\n\nFollowing the success of \"The Godfather\", \"The Conversation\" and \"The Godfather Part II\", Coppola began filming \"Apocalypse Now\", an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" set in Cambodia during the Vietnam War (Coppola himself briefly appears as a TV news director). The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including typhoons, nervous breakdowns, the firing of Harvey Keitel, Martin Sheen's heart attack, extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels and an unprepared Brando with a bloated appearance (which Coppola attempted to hide by shooting him in the shadows). It was delayed so often it was nicknamed \"Apocalypse When?\" The 1991 documentary film \"\", directed by Eleanor Coppola (Francis's wife), Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper, chronicles the difficulties the crew went through making \"Apocalypse Now\" and features behind-the-scenes footage filmed by Eleanor. After filming \"Apocalypse Now\", Coppola famously stated: \"We were in the jungle, there were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment and little by little, we went insane.\"\n\nThe film was overwhelmingly lauded by critics when it finally appeared in 1979 and was selected for the 1979 Cannes Film Festival, winning the Palme d'Or along with \"The Tin Drum\", directed by Volker Schlöndorff. When the film screened at Cannes, he quipped: \"My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam.\" \"Apocalypse Now\"'s reputation has grown in time and it is now regarded by many as a masterpiece of the New Hollywood era and is frequently cited as one of the greatest movies ever made. Roger Ebert considers it to be the finest film on the Vietnam War and included it in his list for the 2002 \"Sight & Sound\" critics' poll of the greatest movies ever made.\n\nIn 2001, Coppola re-released \"Apocalypse Now\" as \"Apocalypse Now Redux\", restoring several sequences lost from the original 1979 cut of the film, thereby expanding its length to 200 minutes.\n\n\"Apocalypse Now\" marked the end of the golden phase of Coppola's career. His musical fantasy \"One from the Heart\", although pioneering the use of video-editing techniques which are standard practice in the film industry today, ended with a disastrous box-office gross of $636,796 against a US$26 million budget, far from enough to recoup the costs incurred in the production of the movie and he was forced to sell his 23-acre Zoetrope Studio in 1983. He would spend the rest of the decade working to pay off his debts. (Zoetrope Studios finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1990, after which its name was changed to American Zoetrope).\n\nFollowing the disastrous \"One from the Heart\", Coppola co-directed \"Hammett\" along with Wim Wenders in the same year. Although Coppola was not credited for his effort, according to one source, \"by the time the final version was released in 1982, only 30 percent of Wenders' footage remained and the rest was completely reshot by Coppola, whose mere 'executive producer' credit is just a technicality.\"\n\nIn 1983, he directed \"The Outsiders\", a film adaptation of the novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton. Coppola credited his inspiration for making the film to a suggestion from middle school students who had read the novel. \"The Outsiders\" is notable for being the breakout film for a number of young actors who would go on to become major stars. These included major roles for Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio and C. Thomas Howell. Also in the cast were Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane and Tom Cruise. Matt Dillon and several others also starred in Coppola's related film, \"Rumble Fish\", which was also based on a S. E. Hinton novel and filmed at the same time as \"The Outsiders\" on-location in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Carmine Coppola wrote and edited the musical score, including the title song \"Stay Gold\", which was based upon a famous Robert Frost poem and performed for the movie by Stevie Wonder. The film was a moderate box-office success, drawing a revenue of $25 million against a budget of $10 million.\n\n\"Rumble Fish\" was based on the novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton, who also co-wrote the screenplay. Shot in black-and-white as an homage to German expressionist films, \"Rumble Fish\" centres on the relationship between a revered former gang leader (Mickey Rourke) and his younger brother, Rusty James (Matt Dillon). The film bombed at the box office, earning a meagre $2.5 million against a budget of $10 million and once again aggravated Coppola's financial troubles.\n\nIn 1984 Coppola directed the Robert Evans-produced \"The Cotton Club\". The film was nominated for several awards, including Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Art-Direction. However, the film failed miserably at the box-office, recouping only $25.9 million of the $47.9 million privately invested by brothers Fred and Ed Doumani.\n\nThe same year he directed an episode of \"Faerie Tale Theatre\" entitled \"Rip Van Winkle\", where Harry Dean Stanton played the lead role.\n\nIn 1986, Coppola directed \"Captain EO\", a 17-minute space fantasy for Disney theme parks executive produced by George Lucas, starring singer Michael Jackson.\n\nIn 1986 Coppola released the comedy \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" starring Kathleen Turner, Coppola's nephew Nicolas Cage, and Jim Carrey. Much like \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish\", \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" centered around teenage youth. The film earned Coppola positive feedback and provided Kathleen Turner her first and only Oscar nomination. It was the first box-office success for Coppola since \"Apocalypse Now\" and the film ranked number 17 on \"Entertainment Weekly\"s list of \"50 Best High School Movies\".\n\nThe following year, Coppola re-teamed with James Caan for \"Gardens of Stone\", but the film was overshadowed by the death of Coppola's eldest son Gian-Carlo Coppola during the film's production. The movie was not a critical success and performed poorly at the box office, earning only $5.6 million against a budget of $13 million.\n\nCoppola directed \"Tucker: The Man and His Dream\" the following year. A biopic based on the life of Preston Tucker and his attempt to produce and market the Tucker '48, Coppola had originally conceived the project as a musical with Marlon Brando after the release of \"The Godfather Part II\". Ultimately it was Jeff Bridges who played the role of Preston Tucker. Budgeted at $24 million, the film received positive reviews and earned three nominations at the 62nd Academy Awards, although its $19.65 million box office was a disappointment. Two awards came its way: Martin Landau won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and Dean Tavoularis took BAFTA's honors for Best Production Design.\n\nIn 1989, Coppola teamed up with fellow Oscar-winning directors Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen for an anthology film called \"New York Stories\". Coppola directed the \"Life Without Zoë\" segment, starring his sister Talia Shire and also co-wrote the film with his daughter Sofia Coppola. \"Life Without Zoë\" was mostly panned by critics and was generally considered the segment that brought the film's overall quality down. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a particularly scathing review, stating that \"It's impossible to know what Francis Coppola's \"Life Without Zoë\" is. Co-written with his daughter Sofia, the film is a mystifying embarrassment; it's by far the director's worst work yet.\"\n\nIn 1990, he released the third and final chapter of \"The Godfather\" series: \"The Godfather Part III\". While not as critically acclaimed as the first two films, it was still a box office success, earning $136 million against a budget of $54 million. Some reviewers criticized the casting of Coppola's daughter Sofia, who had stepped into the leading role of Mary Corleone which had been abandoned by Winona Ryder just as filming began. Despite this, \"The Godfather Part III\" went on to gather 7 Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture. The film failed to win any of these awards, the only film in the trilogy not to do so.\n\nIn 1992, Coppola directed and produced \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\". Adapted from Bram Stoker's novel, it was intended to be more faithful to the book than previous film adaptations. Coppola cast Gary Oldman in the film's title role, with Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins in supporting roles. The movie became a box-office hit, grossing $82,522,790 domestically, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of the year. It fared even better overseas grossing $133,339,902 for a total worldwide gross of $215,862,692 against a budget of $40 million, making it the 9th highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. The film won Academy Awards for Costume Design, Makeup and Sound Editing.\n\nCoppola's next project was \"Jack\", which was released on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate, so at the age of ten he looks like a 40-year-old man. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin and Bill Cosby, \"Jack\" also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58 million domestically on an estimated $45 million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavourably compared with the 1988 film \"Big\", in which Tom Hanks also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny and the dramatic material was unconvincing and unbelievable. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for \"Jack\", he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.\n\nThe last film Coppola directed in the 90s, \"The Rainmaker\", was based on the 1995 novel of the same name by John Grisham. An ensemble courtroom drama, the film was well received by critics, earning an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave \"The Rainmaker\" three stars out of four, remarking: \"I have enjoyed several of the movies based on Grisham novels... but I've usually seen the storyteller's craft rather than the novelist's art being reflected. By keeping all of the little people in focus, Coppola shows the variety of a young lawyer's life, where every client is necessary and most of them need a lot more than a lawyer.\" James Berardinelli also gave the film three stars out of four, saying that \"the intelligence and subtlety of \"The Rainmaker\" took me by surprise\" and that the film \"stands above any other filmed Grisham adaptation\". Grisham said of the film, \"To me it's the best adaptation of any of [my books]... I love the movie. It's so well done.\" The film grossed about $45 million domestically. This would be more than the estimated production budget of $40 million, but a disappointment compared with previous films adapted from Grisham novels.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Coppola started considering concepts for a motion picture based upon the 19th century novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" and in 1991, Coppola and Warner Bros. began discussing the project as well as two others involving the life of J. Edgar Hoover and the children's novel \"The Secret Garden\". These discussions led to negotiations for Coppola to both produce and direct the \"Pinocchio\" project for Warners, as well as \"The Secret Garden\" (which was made in 1993 and produced by American Zoetrope, but directed by Agnieszka Holland) and \"Hoover\", which never came to fruition. (A film was eventually to be made by Clint Eastwood in 2011 as \"J. Edgar\", which was distributed by Warners.)\n\nBut, in mid-1991, Coppola and Warners came to disagreement over the compensation to be paid to Coppola for his directing services on \"Pinocchio\". The parties deferred this issue and finally a settlement was reached in 1998, when the jurors in the resultant court case awarded Coppola $20 million as compensation for losing the \"Pinocchio\" film project. However, they also awarded him a further $60 million in punitive damages on top, stemming from his charges that Warner Bros. sabotaged his intended version. This is the largest civil financial verdict ever against a Hollywood studio.\n\nDuring the filming of \"Contact\" on December 28, 1996, Coppola filed a lawsuit against Carl Sagan and Warner Bros. Sagan had died a week earlier and Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel \"Contact\" was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975, titled \"First Contact\". Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project with American Zoetrope and Children's Television Workshop Productions, as well as any novel Sagan would write. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon & Schuster published Sagan's \"Contact\" and Warner Bros. moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film. Even though Sagan was shown to have violated some of the terms of the agreement, the case was dismissed in February 1998 because Coppola had waited too long to file suit.\n\nAfter a 10-year hiatus, Coppola returned to directing with \"Youth Without Youth\" in 2007, based on the novella of the same name by Romanian author Mircea Eliade. The film was poorly reviewed, currently holding a 30% 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was made for about $19 million and was given a limited release, only managing $2,624,759 at the box-office. As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films in order to avoid the marketing input that goes into most films that results in trying to make films appeal to too wide an audience.\n\nIn 2009, Coppola released \"Tetro\". It was \"set in Argentina, with the reunion of two brothers. The story follows the rivalries born out of creative differences passed down through generations of an artistic Italian immigrant family.\" The film received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the film has an average metascore of 63% based on 19 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 70% of critics gave positive reviews based on 105 reviews with an average score of 6.3/10. Overall, the Rotten Tomatoes consensus was: \"A complex meditation on family dynamics, \"Tetro\"'s arresting visuals and emotional core compensate for its uneven narrative.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 3 stars, praising the film for being \"boldly operatic, involving family drama, secrets, generations at war, melodrama, romance and violence\". Ebert also praised Vincent Gallo's performance and claimed that Alden Ehrenreich is \"the new Leonardo DiCaprio\". Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" gave the film a B+ judging that \"when Coppola finds creative nirvana, he frequently has trouble delivering the full goods.\" Richard Corliss of \"TIME\" gave the film a mixed review, praising Ehrenreich's performance, but claiming Coppola \"has made a movie in which plenty happens, but nothing rings true.\" It has made $2,636,774 worldwide, against a budget of $5,000,000.\n\n\"Twixt\", starring Val Kilmer, Elle Fanning, Joanne Whalley and Bruce Dern and narrated by Tom Waits, was released to film festivals in late 2011 and was released theatrically in early 2012. It received critical acclaim in France, but mostly negative reviews elsewhere.\n\n\"Distant Vision\" is a live semi-autobiographical novella-length film wrought in real-time on the 6,000-square-foot soundstage at Oklahoma City Community College. The live cinema project had a limited screening on June 5, 2015.\n\nIn 1971, Coppola and George Lucas co-produced the latter's first film, \"THX 1138\". Shortly after completion of production they brought the finished film to Warner Bros., along with several other scripts for potential projects at their newly founded company, American Zoetrope. However, studio executives strongly disliked all the scripts, including \"THX\" and demanded that Coppola repay the $300,000 they had loaned him for the Zoetrope studio, as well as insisting on cutting five minutes from the film. The debt nearly closed Zoetrope and forced Coppola to reluctantly focus on \"The Godfather\".\n\nHis company American Zoetrope also administers the Zoetrope Virtual Studio, a complete motion picture production studio for members only. Launched in June 2000, the culmination of more than four years work, it brings together departments for screenwriters, directors, producers and other filmmaker artists, plus new departments for other creative endeavours. Filmmaker members can workshop a wide range of film arts, including music, graphics, design and film and video.\n\nCoppola, with his family, expanded his business ventures to include winemaking in California's Napa Valley, when in 1975 he purchased the former home and adjoining vineyard of Gustave Niebaum in Rutherford, California using proceeds from the first movie in the \"Godfather\" trilogy. His winery produced its first vintage in 1977 with the help of his father, wife and children stomping the grapes barefoot and every year the family has a harvest party to continue the tradition.\n\nAfter purchasing the property, he produced wine under the Niebaum-Coppola label. When he purchased the former Inglenook Winery chateau in 1995, he renamed the winery Rubicon Estate Winery in 2006. On 11 April 2011, Coppola acquired the iconic Inglenook trademark paying more, he said, for the trademark than he did for the entire estate and announced that the estate would once again be known by its historic original name, Inglenook. Its grapes are now entirely organically grown.\n\nGeorge Altamura, a real estate developer announced in 2003 that he had partnered with several people, including Francis Ford Coppola, in a project to restore the Uptown Theater in downtown Napa, California in order to create a live entertainment venue.\n\nCoppola is also the owner of Francis Ford Coppola Presents, a lifestyle brand under which he markets goods from companies he owns or controls. It includes films and videos, resorts, cafes, a literary magazine, a line of pastas and pasta sauces called Mammarella Foods and a winery.\n\nThe Francis Ford Coppola Winery near Geyserville, California, located on the former Chateau Souverain Winery, where he has opened a family-friendly facility, is influenced by the idea of the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, with swimming pools, bocce courts and a restaurant. The winery displays several of Coppola's Oscars along with memorabilia from his movies, including Vito Corleone's desk from \"The Godfather\" and a restored 1948 Tucker Sedan as used in \"\".\n\nIncluded in the Francis Ford Coppola Presents lifestyle brand are several hotels and resorts around the world. The Blancaneaux Lodge in Belize, which from the early 1980s was a family retreat until it was opened to the public in 1993 as a 20-room luxury resort and The Turtle Inn, in Placencia, Belize, (both of which have won several prestigious awards including \"Travel + Leisure's World's Best: Best Resort in Central & South America\"); La Lancha in Lago Petén Itzá, Guatemala; Jardin Escondido in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Palazzo Margherita in Bernalda, Italy.\n\nIn San Francisco, Coppola owns a restaurant named Cafe Zoetrope, located in the Sentinel Building where American Zoetrope is based. It serves traditional Italian cuisine and wine from his personal estate vineyard. For 14 years from 1994, Coppola co-owned the Rubicon restaurant in San Francisco along with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. Rubicon closed in August 2008.\n\nHe brought out the San Francisco-based \"City Magazine\" in the 1970s, but lost $1.5 million on this venture.\n\nIn 1997, Coppola founded \"\", a literary magazine devoted to short stories and design. The magazine publishes fiction by emerging writers alongside more recognizable names, such as Woody Allen, Margaret Atwood, Haruki Murakami, Alice Munro, Don DeLillo, Mary Gaitskill, and Edward Albee; as well as essays, including ones from Mario Vargas Llosa, David Mamet, Steven Spielberg, and Salman Rushdie. Each issue is designed, in its entirety, by a prominent artist, one usually working outside his / her expected field. Previous guest designers include Gus Van Sant, Tom Waits, Laurie Anderson, Marjane Satrapi, Guillermo del Toro, David Bowie, David Byrne, and Dennis Hopper. Coppola serves as founding editor and publisher of \"All-Story\".\n\nCoppola stated that \"The Godfather Part IV\" was never made as Mario Puzo died before they had a chance to write the film. Andy García has since claimed the film's script was nearly produced.\n\nCoppola was the jury president at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival and he also took part as a special guest at the 46th International Thessaloniki Film Festival in Greece.\n\nOver the years, Coppola has given contributions to several candidates of the Democratic Party, including Mike Thompson and Nancy Pelosi for the U.S. House of Representatives and Barbara Boxer and Alan Cranston for the U.S. Senate.\n\nHe had planned to direct an epic movie named \"Megalopolis\", a story about the aftermath and reconstruction of New York City after a mega-disaster, but after the city was hit by the real life disaster of September 11, 2001, the project was seen as being too sensitive. In 2007 Coppola stated that \"I have abandoned that as of now. I plan to begin a process of making one personal movie after another and if something leads me back to look at that, which I'm sure it might, I'll see what makes sense to me.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3208818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3208818", "title": "Gilbert Austin", "text": "Gilbert Austin\n\nGilbert Austin (1753–1837) was an Irish educator, clergyman and author. Austin is best known for his 1806 book on chironomia, \"Chironomia, or a Treatise on Rhetorical Delivery\". Heavily influenced by classical writers, Austin stressed the importance of voice and gesture to a successful oration.\n\nGilbert Austin was born in 1753 in County Louth, Ireland. Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, Austin received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1774 and his Master of Arts degree in 1780. After graduating, Austin established a private school in Dublin where he taught the sons of Ireland's elite, including Augustus Frederick FitzGerald, later Third Duke of Leinster (Robb and Thonssen 1966:xv-xvi). Austin inscribed his best-known work, \"Chironomia, or a Treatise on Rhetorical Delivery\", to another of his former pupils, Francis William Caulfeild, Earl of Charlemont.\n\nAn active member of the Royal Irish Academy, Austin wrote several scientific papers describing his inventions. In 1789, Austin edited and published a collection of poems by Irish writer Thomas Dermody. Austin also published a number of his sermons, including the collection \"Sermons on Practical Subjects\". Austin began work on his most famous book, \"Chironomia\", in the 1770s but it was not published until 1806.\n\nAustin held several clerical appointments in the Church of Ireland. In 1798, Austin became a minor canon of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. From 1816 until his death in 1837, Austin was Vicar of Laraghbryan (or Maynooth), a living to which he was presented by his former pupil, the Duke of Leinster. Austin also held the prebendary of Blackrath from 1821 to 1835 (Robb and Thonssen 1966:xvi).\n\nBetween 1790 and 1803, Austin published three articles in the \"Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy\". Philippa Spoel (1998) writes, \"these articles, which describe the construction and application of chemical apparatus invented by Austin, demonstrate his involvement...with the flourishing field of chemistry\" (7). The inventions Austin described include a portable barometer, a mechanism for filling water with carbon dioxide, and an apparatus for collecting gasses over water and mercury. In 1813, Austin published \"On a New Construction of a Condenser and Air-Pump\" in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London\".\n\nIn 1789, Austin edited and published Thomas Dermody's first collection of poetry, \"Poems\".\nIn 1794, Austin published \"A Sermon on a Future State: Combating the Opinion that \"Death is Eternal Sleep.\"\" American author Edgar Allan Poe (1844) described Austin's sermon as \"nearly, if not quite the best 'Essay on a Future State' \" (584). Austin published \"Sermons on Practical Subjects\" in 1795 and \"A Sermon for the Support of Mercer's Hospital\" in 1796.\n\nIn the preface to \"Chironomia\", Austin writes\n...it is a fact, that we do not possess from the ancients, nor yet from the labours of our own countrymen, any sufficiently detailed and precise precepts for the fifth division of the art of rhetoric, namely rhetorical delivery, called by the ancients \"actio\" and \"pronuntiatio\". (ix)\nAustin observed that British orators were skilled in the first four divisions of rhetoric: inventio, dispositio, elocutio, and memoria. However, the fifth division, pronuntiatio or delivery, was all but ignored. Delivery, which is often improperly referred to as elocution (elocutio), concerns the use of voice and gesture in an oration. Rather than study the art of delivery, orators trusted to the inspiration of the moment to guide their voices and gestures. Austin describes this as a reliance on \"gestures imperfectly conceived...which will consequently be imperfectly executed\" (5).\n\n\"Chironomia\" is a treatise on the importance of good delivery. Good delivery, Austin notes, can \"conceal in some degree the blemishes of the composition, or the matter delivered, and...add lustre to its beauties\" (187). In the first part of the book, Austin traces the study of the art of delivery from the classical world to the 18th century. The second part of the book is devoted to a description of the notation system Austin designed to teach students of rhetoric the management of gesture and voice. The system of notation is accompanied by a series of illustrations depicting positions of the feet, body and hands.\n\nThroughout \"Chironomia\", Austin instructs speakers to avoid the appearance of vulgarity or rusticity. Austin first developed the system of notation described in \"Chironomia\" at his school for privileged young men. Austin's goal was to prepare his students for a life in the church or politics by training them to become better orators. Although Austin's system was eventually dismissed as too rigidly prescriptive, \"Chironomia\" was a highly influential book during the 19th century.\n\nDiscussing the need for a treatise on delivery, Austin writes \"during my examination of modern writers, it has appeared to me, that, with little exception, they have neglected to pay due attention to the precepts and authority of the great and ancient masters\" (v). Austin remedies this oversight by compiling a collection of classical sources on the art of delivery. Austin was heavily influenced by Cicero and Quintilian. Cicero refers to action as the \"language of the body\" and the art of delivery as \"corporeal eloquence\" (Austin [1806] 1966:1). Austin attributes to Quintilian the use of the word \"chironomia\" to refer to the art of gesture (2). In \"Chironomia\", Austin quotes extensively from Cicero's \"De oratore\" and Quintilian's \"Institutio oratoria\".\n\nAustin also cites Ludovicus Cressolius's 1620 book \"Vacationes Autumales sive de perfecta Oratoris, Actione, et Pronuntiatione\" and the work of Caussinus as influences. Despite their use of the term elocution for the art Austin calls delivery, Austin refers to Thomas Sheridan's \"Lectures on Elocution\" (1762) and John Walker's \"Elements of Elocution\" (1781) in his discussion of voice and countenance.\n\nAustin's work would appear to be a direct descendent of John Bulwer's book \"Chirologia, or, the Natural Language of the Hand\" which, when it was published in 1644, also included Bulwer's work \"Chironomia; or, the Art of Manual Rhetoricke\". However, Austin does not mention Bulwer anywhere in his \"Chironomia\". Robb and Thonssen (1966) suggest this is because Austin was unfamiliar with Bulwer's book (xi).\n\nAustin was concerned with both the quality and management of the voice; he considered the former a gift of nature and the latter a matter of art (29). Austin developed rules for the management of articulation, pronunciation and emphasis. On articulation, Austin writes [words] are to be delivered out from the lips, as beautiful coins newly issued from the mint, deeply and accurately impressed, perfectly finished, neatly struck by the proper organs, distinct, sharp, in due succession and of due weight. (38) Austin agreed with Sheridan's advice that good articulation consisted of pronouncing each syllable distinctly and with proper emphasis (37). Austin's rules for pronunciation address the issue of the provincial accent, something Austin labels \"a stain of rusticity\" (47). Austin encouraged his students to rid themselves of their provincial accent in favour of a courtly accent.\n\nIn addition to his rules for the management of the voice, Austin also addresses issues of vocal quality including pitch, volume and variety. Austin was also concerned with the management of facial expression. Austin stresses the importance of using appropriate tones of voice, facial expressions and gestures to convey sincerity.\n\nAustin describes gesture as the \"action and position of all the parts of the body\" (133) and attributes to gesture the power to convey meaning. During the 18th century, speakers preferred the natural style of gesture but Austin warns against this style saying that speakers who rely on nature run the risk of displaying \"the untutored extravagance and uncouth motions of the vulgar\" (138 see \"Plate 2, Figures 8 and 9\" below). By following Austin's guidelines, speakers could improve their delivery by matching their gestures to their words. Austin advises his students, however, that gesture should be used with restraint and only when appropriate (137).\n\nAustin's system of notation begins with the placement of the body in an imaginary sphere (see \"Plate 2, Fig. 18\" below). The speaker then moves his or her body, feet or hands toward one of the points on the sphere. Each movement is assigned a notation that specifies the direction and manner in which the speaker should move. The speaker should include these notations in the text of his or her speech so that he or she knows when and how to move. Notation regarding the hands is written above the sentence; notation regarding the feet is written below. For instance, the notation \"Bcl. e f sh.\" above a word indicates that the speaker should clasp both hands and extend them forward at shoulder height in a shaking motion (see \"Plate 8, Fig. 75\" below). The notation \"L 1 x\" under a word indicates that the speaker should advance the left foot and bend the right knee. Austin also provides a notation system for the voice. Notation marks are placed at the beginning of a passage and then throughout the text whenever the speaker is to change the tone or rapidity of his or her vocal delivery.\n\nThe text of \"Chironomia\" is accompanied by 12 engraved plates depicting various positions of the feet, arms and body. Austin credits George Chinnery as the original artist but claims that he could not afford to pay Chinnery to complete the engravings. An anonymous young man was employed to alter and complete the plates (Austin [1806] 1966:viii).\n\nRobb and Thonssen (1966) write, \"until the teaching of [François] Delsarte...Austin was the authority on teaching gesture\" (xvii). With the publication of \"Chironomia\", Austin's influence extended beyond his own school to classrooms throughout Britain and America. By the end of the 19th century, however, \"Chironomia\" had fallen from favour. Austin's method was considered too mechanical for modern tastes. G. P. Mohrmann (1968) claims the misperception of \"Chironomia\" as rigidly prescriptive is due to a lack of critical analysis of Austin's method (18). Spoel (1998) describes \"Chironomia\" as \"a unique socially and historically situated representation of bodily discipline\" (5). \"Chironomia\" remains of interest to scholars not only for its insight into late-18th and early-19th century rhetorical practices but also for its collection of classical writings on delivery.\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the most influential trade union leaders of the labour movement after World War I.\n\nHe was born at Cerignola, Apulia, into a family of poor agricultural day laborers. As an autodidact, Di Vittorio became active in the socialist movement in adolescence. At 15, he was a member of the Socialist Youth Circle in Cerignola, and in 1911, he moved to lead the Camera del Lavoro in Minervino Murge and then the one in Bari.\n\nHe was among the most influential union leaders in the history of the labour movement, leading the Confederazione Generate Italiana dei Lavoratori (CGIL) in its refounding after fascism and the powerful World Federation of Trade Unions(FSM) after World War II.\n\nAfter his father's death, Di Vittorio was forced to leave school and work as a day laborer. He joined the May 1904 general strike during which five workers were killed by troops in Cerignola. Di Vittorio was strongly influenced by the growth of peasants' organizations and the spread of socialist ideas, giving rise to his participation in the local young socialist organization in Cerignola. He was radicalised by affiliating with the national Federazione Giovanile Socialista (Federation of Young Socialists), led by syndicalists in opposition to the official Socialist Party Youth Federation.\n\nAs a native of the \"Mezzogiorno\", Di Vittorio became involved in the syndicalist plans for solving the region's acute problems in the manner illustrated by the Fasci Siciliani in final decade of the 19th century. A partisan of insurgence, Di Vittorio became a leader of an anarcho-syndicalist trade union, Unione Sindacale Italiana, after its formation in 1912. Unlike the majority of the group, which opposed militarism and Italy's entry into World War I), Di Vittorio, Alceste De Ambris and Filippo Corridoni advocated irredentism. He then fought in the conflict and was discharged after he had been gravely wounded.\n\nIn 1921, after the Italian Socialist Party's split at the Congress of Livorno, he joined the Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I). Di Vittorio joined the militant antifascist organization \"Arditi del Popolo\", and hevwas then elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies on the PCI list in 1924. The new situation after the rise of fascism and the March on Rome made him an enemy of Benito Mussolini's regime. Sentenced to twelve years in prison by a fascist special tribunal in 1925, he managed to flee to France, where he refounded the dissolved Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro (CGIL) and led it into the Soviet-managed Profintern. Di Vittorio lived in the Soviet state from 1928 to 1930, representing Italy to the Red Peasant International. He then returned to Paris, where he entered the Politburo of the PCI.\n\nHe joined the Republican side fighting Francisco Franco's forces during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. He was Political Commissar of the XI International Brigade. After the fall of the Republic, he headed the board of a Paris-based antifascist newspaper. During the World War II, after the Fall of France to Nazi Germany, Di Vittorio was arrested by Nazis, taken in custody by the Italian police and detained on Ventotene. In 1943, as the Fascist regime fell in most of Italy, he was set free by partisans, and he joined the Resistance in fighting against Mussolini's Italian Social Republic, in Northern Italy.\n\nWhen war ended in 1945, he was elected secretary of the CGIL, which he had helped return to politics through a pact signed the previous year with Achille Grandi and Oreste Lizzardi in Rome. The pact recreated CGIL as a representative of all currents of trade unionism in Italy communist, socialist, Christian-democrats and anarcho-syndicalists. In 1948, the organisation split after a general strike, protesting the assassination attempt on PCI leader Palmiro Togliatti. The Christian Democrats left to form the Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Lavoratori. On March 5, 1950, the Social Democrats, who would join the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, left to form the Unione Italiana del Lavoro.\n\nDi Vittorio led the CGIL, as a group favoured by the PCI and the Italian Socialist Party, until his death at Lecco, in 1957. He was also a longtime leader of the World Federation of Trade Unions. His strong charisma made him the most popular myth of the Italian workers. His funeral was attended by more than three million people coming to Rome from all over Italy. \n\nHe was followed in his position at the CGIL by Agostino Novella.\n"}

His casket remained in the \"Quinta de Olivos\" presidential residence until the March 1976 coup. The coffin was then placed in the Perón family tomb in Chacarita Cemetery, located in the Chacarita ward of the city of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn July 1987, 13 years after his death, the Peronist Justicialist Party received an anonymous letter claiming Perón's hands had been removed from his tomb along with his army cap and sword; the letter demanded the party pay an US$8 million ransom for their return. When authorities checked Perón's tomb, they discovered that it had indeed been broken into and the hands and other items removed. Forensic experts who examined the body said the mutilation had occurred only a short time before the discovery. One source states that the tomb was broken into on June 23, 1987, and that a poem written to him by his last wife, Isabel, had also been removed from the tomb. At the time, some news reports stated that the hands had been removed with \"a surgical instrument\", but later reports state that the dismemberment had been done with an electric saw.\n\nThe head of the Justicialist Party, Vicente Saadi, refused to allow the ransom to be paid. A criminal investigation was begun under the leadership of judge Jaime Far Suau: although six men were arrested and five arraigned, none were charged in relation to the incident. No suspect has ever been charged, and the hands have never been recovered.\n\nMany of those involved in the investigation of the disappearance of Perón's hands (including Judge Far Suau) have since died, some under circumstances considered questionable. There is evidence that the theft had some sort of official support, as the robbers used a key to enter the tomb.\n\nArgentinian anthropologist Rosana Guber has written that Perón's hands were seen by Argentinians as a symbol of his power, and that their theft was not just a simple criminal matter but also had deep cultural meaning; she viewed the debate about the hands as symbolic of the attempt to promote democracy in the country. Lyman Johnson viewed the dismemberment as \"a catalyst to destroy the symbolic cult of Perón\". With Perón's hands gone, Lyman wrote, his body became less important and his importance as a religious figure also decreased in comparison to that of his second wife, Eva Perón.\n\nIn their book \"Second Death: Licio Gelli, The P2 Masonic Lodge and The Plot to Destroy Juan Peron\", writers Damian Nabot and David Cox write that the Masonic lodge P2, also known as the Propaganda Due, were involved in the theft, and that there was a ritual involved in the cutting of Peron's hands.\n\nSome other people - like writer Ciriaco Offeddu - put forward the idea that in fact Perón did not belong to the Peron family but that he was a Sardinian orphan from Mamoiada, adopted when very young. To hide his true identity his hands were removed. People of Mamoiada are famous for their ferocity.\n"}

Living in Berlin between 1853 and 1863, he attended high school, followed by the University of Berlin, from which he obtained a doctorate in 1863. He was a professor at the University of Iași from 1864 to 1884, and at the University of Bucharest from 1885 until his retirement in 1897. He was elected to the Assembly of Deputies in 1870, and later joined the Romanian Senate. He was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1881, was later its general secretary, and served three terms as Academy president: 1893-1894, 1910-1913 and 1923-1926. Negruzzi was among the founders of \"Junimea\", and became its secretary in 1868. He played a very significant role as editor of \"Convorbiri Literare\", ensuring the magazine's regular appearance by investing an immense amount of energy and making significant sacrifices, including material ones. He continued as editor for ten years after moving to Bucharest in 1885. He wrote reviews and notes in \"Convorbiri\"; published selections from \"Copii de pe natură\" (which appeared in book form in 1874), as well as the novel \"Mihai Vereanu\" (which appeared in 1873); and initiated a column called \"Corespondență\", probably the country's first true letter to the editor section.\n\nHis press debut came in 1866, with a one-act play that appeared in \"Foaia Soțietății pentru Literatura și Cultura Română în Bucovina\"; his first book was the 1872 \"Poezii\". Although written starting in 1889, \"Amintirile din \"Junimea\"\" was only published in 1921. He translated several plays by Friedrich Schiller (\"The Robbers\", \"Fiesco\" and \"Intrigue and Love\" appeared in book form in 1871; \"The Maid of Orleans\" in \"Convorbiri Literare\" in 1883; \"Don Carlos\" and \"Mary Stuart\" in the last of his six-volume complete works that came out between 1893 and 1897). Other translations included Romantic poetry, both French (Victor Hugo) and German (Schiller and Heinrich Heine), published in \"Poezii\". His wife was Maria Rosetti.\n"}

Wallace appeared in two Super Bowls.\n\nSince the end of his NFL career, Wallace has periodically struggled with substance abuse and experienced bouts of homelessness. In 2014, he joined a class-action concussion lawsuit against the NFL. As of February 2018, his whereabouts were unknown.\n\nWallace was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he lived in the St. Bernard Projects.\n\nWallace attended St. Augustine High School in New Orleans. He enrolled at the University of Arizona and played college football for the Arizona Wildcats from 1970 through 1972. United Press International and \"Sporting News\" named him a first-team All-America in 1972, while the Associated Press named him a third-team All-American. He was named to the All-Western Athletic Conference (WAC) team in his junior and senior years. Wallace had 20 interceptions with the Wildcats, the second-most in school history, with 19 of those coming in his junior and senior years. His 11 interceptions in 1971 is a WAC record.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings selected Wallace in the second round, with the 34th overall pick, in the 1973 NFL draft. Wallace played six professional seasons as a cornerback from 1974 through 1979. He spent his rookie season on the Vikings' practice squad, including Super Bowl VIII. He became a starter for the Vikings the next year, and started in Super Bowl IX.\n\nWallace played for the Baltimore Colts in 1975 and the Los Angeles Rams from 1976 through 1979. His 52 punt returns and 618 punt return yards led the NFL in 1978. His final game in the NFL was Super Bowl XIV as a member of the Rams. After the game, he berated his coach in the Rose Bowl locker room for not using him in the game, saying the coach could \"kiss his ass\". That offseason, he was disinvited from the Super Bowl ring party and cut from the team. He retired with 11 career interceptions in 70 games played.\n\nOut of the NFL, Wallace worked on an oil platform. The year after his football career ended, his mother died and he began to abuse alcohol and use crack cocaine. He has battled addictions to numerous drugs, including crack, alcohol, and heroin, throughout his life, and has disappeared for years at a time.\n\nTed Jackson, a photojournalist for \"The Times-Picayune\", discovered him homeless on the streets of New Orleans in 1990, which inspired Wallace to make an attempt at recovery; at the time, his whereabouts had been unknown for roughly a decade. He became sober, got married, and bought a house in the northeastern suburbs of Baltimore. His sobriety lasted until 2002, when a domestic dispute with his wife led to him fleeing back to the streets of New Orleans. After several years of drug use, he was jailed in 2008 for check fraud, serving half of a seven-year sentence; released early for good behavior. On June 5, 2012, the WDSU television channel in New Orleans ran an article about the New Orleans Mission (a homeless shelter) closing its doors due to financial problems. In the article, Wallace stated that he was homeless and had been frequenting the shelter for two months. Wallace achieved sobriety again in 2014 and joined Narcotics Anonymous; the same year, Wallace took part in a lawsuit against the NFL regarding concussions.\n\nIn July 2017, Wallace disappeared again, having relapsed and returned to the streets.

{"id": "1386697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1386697", "title": "Jerry Potts", "text": "Jerry Potts\n\nJerry Potts (1840 – July 14, 1896), (also known as \"Ky-yo-kosi\", meaning \"Bear Child\"), was an American - Canadian plainsman, buffalo hunter, horse trader, interpreter, and scout of Kainai (Blood) and Scots heritage.\n\nPotts was born near Fort McKenzie, the only child of his Kainai (\"Akáínaa\" - \"Many Chief\", while \"Káína\" - \"Many Chief people\") mother \"Namo-pisi\" (Crooked Back) and Andrew R. Potts, a Scottish fur trader. 1840; . Upon the death of his father in 1840, Jerry was given to American Fur Company trader Alexander Harvey by Namo-pisi prior to her rejoining her tribe. A violent, vindictive man, Harvey neglected and mistreated Potts before deserting him in 1845. American Fur Company trader Andrew Dawson of Fort Benton, Montana, a gentle man who was called \"the last king of the Missouri,\" then adopted young Potts. He taught the boy to read and write and allowed him to mix with the Indians who visited the trading post to learn their customs and languages. In his late teens Potts, who adopted the carefree mannerisms of the frontier, joined his mother’s people and from then on drifted between them and Dawson. As a person of mixed blood, he had to prove to both Métis and whites that he could cope in their respective cultures, and was well served by his quick wits, reckless bravery, skills with the knife and lethal accuracy with both a revolver and a rifle.\n\nWhen he became an adult through puberty, Potts was employed for several years by the American Fur Company, and from 1869 to 1874 he worked as a hunter for various whiskey traders. Much of this period of his life was shadowed by violence. He gained fame as an Indian warrior, and almost legendary accounts of his battles with the traditional enemies of the Blackfoot Confederacy, to which his mother's people belonged - the Sioux, Crow, and the mighty Iron Confederacy (Nehiyaw-Pwat) (Cree, Assiniboine, Saulteaux, Stoney) abound.\n\nPotts married two members of the Piegan Blackfeet (or \"Aamsskáápipikani\" - ″Southern Piikáni/Peigan″) named Panther Woman and Spotted Killer. Between the pair he sired several sons and several daughters. He considered himself a Piegan but he kept his Kainai name, Kyi-yo-Kosi (Bear Child).\n\nBy the time Potts was twenty-five, he was a wealthy man because of his horse trading. His herd rarely averaged less than 100 horses which made him the second wealthiest Indian in the area as wealth was measured by the Plains Indians in the number of horses a man owned. That his horses carried a number of diverse brands meant nothing. He could always produce bills of sale (even though he could not read them himself) for most of them. Those without papers, if they were American horses, were sold in Canada while paperless Canadian horses were sold south of the Medicine Line. Those branded with the markings of the US Cavalry were sold as far north as possible unless he had papers proving they had been purchased legally.\n\nThe going rate for a good horse at the time ranged between $75.00 to $150.00 so his large inventory showed his wealth. When he journeyed to Montana Territory to buy horses he would carry cash - often as much as a thousand dollars - with which to make the transactions. People knew he carried such amounts but they also knew he was Jerry Potts so he was left alone.\n\nHe became a minor chief with the Kainai when he was perhaps twenty-five in recognition of his bravery in battle, his unquestioned leadership abilities, and his knowledge of the prairies. It is said he knew every trail from Fort Edmonton to the lands of the Cheyenne and Apache and every hill between those trails. He could find game when all others had returned to camp empty-handed. He spent much of his time in what is now Montana, guiding, trading horses, and drinking.\n\nPotts could speak several languages. He was fluent in American English, Blackfoot, and Crow (Apsáalooke aliláau), had a better than average ability in Plains Cree (nēhiyawēwin) (which he would speak only when necessary), and was passable in Lakota-Sioux (Lakȟótiyapi), Assiniboine (Nakona or A' M̆oqazh), and Algonquin.\n\nFor all his ability to get along with white men Potts was very much an Indian. He never fully understood the white man's reasoning. For instance, he could never understand the reason that white settlers equipped their houses with chamber pots. \"Why,\" he once asked a Mountie, \"would anyone piss in a perfectly good eating bowl when the entire prairie lay before him\"?\n\nDuring his teens Potts passed all the Indian rites of passage including the final agony of the Sun Dance wherein the fledgling brave is tied to a pole by thongs threaded through his chest muscles. Successful completion of this rite meant the youth had achieved glory by tearing himself loose either immediately or by staying tied to the pole in absolute silence for up to three days and then tearing loose. Potts chose to remain the full three days for such was his nature. He also belonged to several of the secret warrior societies which prevailed in large numbers throughout the Blackfoot nation.\n\nPotts wore his \"magic\" talisman - a cat skin - next to his body at all times and hung his captured scalps on the lodge pole of his main teepee in Indian fashion. Still, he wore the clothing of the white man most of the time including a fashionable hat that sported a wide headband. His bushy, drooping mustache was as stylish as that of any white man.\n\nFrom a distance the stocky, bow-legged Potts looked like a white trapper in his buckskin clothing, his Stetson at a jaunty angle upon his head. Two .44 pistols hung from his gun belt complimenting the Henry rifle which never left his side. On his leg was strapped a long-bladed skinning knife. He always kept a small gun inside a hide-away pocket, a practice that saved his life on several occasions.\n\nThe Cree and Assiniboine lived just like the Blackfoot people by the dwindling herds of the buffalo and their hunters followed their prey, which was about 1850 found almost exclusively on the territory of the Blackfoot and caused the so-called buffalo wars between these two confederacies. In 1861, the Gros Ventres left the Blackfoot Confederacy, being part of it for some 90 years, allying with the Crow. Together they fought the Blackfoot Confederacy but by the 1867, they were defeated and became allies of the Assiniboine, members of the Iron Confederacy (Nehiyaw-Pwat).\n\nTherefore, in 1870 various \"Nehiyaw-Pwat\" bands of Plains Cree and Plains Assiniboine began a final effort to get hold of their prey, by beginning a war. They hoped to defeat the Blackfoot weakened by smallpox. An advance party of Cree and Assiniboine under the lead of Plains Chief Chief Big Bear (Mistahimaskwa) and Piapot (Hole in the Sioux), Chief of the Cree-Assiniboines (Young Dogs), had stumbled upon a Peigan camp near Fort Whoop-Up (called by the Blackfoot \"Akaisakoyi\" - \"Many Dead\") and decided to attack instead of informing the main Cree body of their find. Just in nick of time Jerry Potts with a group of Peigans and 2 Blood bands who armed with repeating rifles came to their assistance. In the daylong so-called Battle of the Belly River on October 25, 1870 near present-day Lethbridge (called by the Blackfoot \"Assini-etomochi\" – \"where we slaughtered the Cree\") the combined Cree-Assiniboine force, who lost over 300 warriors, was defeated. The slaughter was such that Jerry Potts said; \"You could fire with your eyes shut and be sure to kill a Cree.\"\n\nThe next winter the hunger compelled the Nehiyaw-Pwat to negotiate with the Blackfoot, and in 1873 Crowfoot (Isapo-Muxika) (\"Issapóómahksika\" - \"Crow-big-foot\"), chief of the Siksika (\"Siksikáwa\" - ″Blackfoot People″), adopted Pitikwahanapiwiyin (Poundmaker) of mixed Cree and Assiniboine parentage, creating a final peace between the \"Nehiyaw-Pwat\" (Cree-Assiniboine) and Blackfoot. The Battle of the Belly River was the last major conflict between the Cree and the Blackfoot Confederacy, and the last major battle between First Nations in Western Canada.\nIn 1871, Potts was about thirty-one when his mother was murdered. Her killer had been an Indian who was drunk on \"firewater\" so he declared his own personal war on the whiskey runners. By the time Potts was 36 he had killed at least 40 men, mostly whiskey runners.\n\nIn September 1874, Potts was trading horses in Fort Benton, Montana. He was hired as a guide, interpreter and scout by the North-West Mounted Police. His contract as a guide for the North-West Mounted Police was to last twenty-two years. He was paid $90 per month, which was quite a bit higher than a regular guide, and three times a police constable's salary. Even City Marshals in large cities such as Abilene or Dodge City often earned less than that amount. He also picked the location for the first North-West Mounted Police post, called Fort Macleod.\n\nHe only ceased working for the force at age fifty-eight because the pain of throat cancer made it so that he could no longer ride. He died a year later, on 14 July 1896 at Fort Macleod.\n\nJerry Potts was buried at Fort Macleod with full honors in 1896 having served with the North-West Mounted Police for twenty-two years and being given the rank of special constable.\n\nPotts always received more salary than any other guide/interpreter because as a guide he had no equal. He was useful as an interpreter because he spoke all the Indian languages of the prairies. He could also speak passable Sioux - if he felt like it. He also understood the differing cultures of the Indians and the North-West Mounted Police. He was able to instruct the police in the proper procedures for receiving a chief. His interpretations would also be different, depending on who he was speaking to. His interpretations of the long, verbose speeches of the Indians were always short and concise. Long speeches would be reduced to only a few words. His interpretations into the Indian languages, however, were always long and passionate. Potts did this because he understood that long speech in Indians cultures was meant to show respect, while for whites, it was only a way to show off.\n\nOnce, following a Blackfoot chief's extremely long, flowery, impassioned speech to a delegation of visiting officials who had arrived from Ottawa to sign an historic treaty with the Blackfoot people, Potts remained silent as if fully digesting the colorful language. Finally, when asked what the chief had said, the laconic Potts shrugged and replied, \"He says he's damned glad you're here.\" On another occasion, when asked by Inspector MacLeod what lay beyond a high rising hill ahead, Potts muttered, \"Nuther hill.\"\n\nPotts had two wives, who blessed him with several sons and a couple of daughters. He named one of his sons Blue Gun in commemoration of his favorite rifle. His many descendants still live mainly in Alberta and Saskatchewan with a few in Montana. Three of his descendants, one a young woman named Janet Potts, became Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers during the middle years of this century.\n\nThe city of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, east of Fort Macleod, has named a boulevard in Jerry Potts' honour. In about 1867 Jerry was elected king of fire (okmakak) while he was staying at the Peigan (Piikani) encampment.\n\nOn 8 September 1992 Canada Post issued 'Jerry Potts, Legendary Plainsman' as part of the Folklore, Legendary Heroes series. The stamps were designed by Ralph Tibbles, based on illustrations by \nDeborah Drew-Brook and Allan Cormack. The 42¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.\n\nIn Sam Peckinpah's 1965 western film, Major Dundee, the character of the scout Samuel Potts, played by James Coburn, was inspired in part by the persona of Jerry Potts himself\n\n6. His life featured in the book:The Last Crossing by Guy Vanderhaeghe\n\n"}

At age seventeen, Bench was selected 36th overall by the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the 1965 amateur draft, playing for the minor-league in the 1966 and 1967 seasons before being called up to the Reds in August 1967. He hit only .163, but impressed many people with his defense and strong throwing arm, among them Hall of Famer Ted Williams. Williams signed a baseball for him and predicted that the young catcher would be \"a Hall of Famer for sure!\" Williams' prophecy became fact 22 years later in 1989 when Bench was elected to Cooperstown.\n\nDuring a spring training game in 1968, Bench was catching for eight-year veteran right-hander Jim Maloney. Maloney was once a hard thrower, but by this time injuries had dramatically reduced the speed of his fastball. Maloney insisted on repeatedly \"shaking off\" his younger catcher by throwing fastballs instead of the breaking balls that Bench had called for. An exasperated Bench bluntly told Maloney, \"Your fastball's not popping\". Maloney replied with an epithet. To prove to Maloney that his fastball wasn't effective anymore, Bench called for a fastball, and after Maloney released the ball, Bench dropped his catcher's mitt and comfortably caught the fastball barehanded. Bench was the Reds' catcher on April 30, 1969 when Maloney pitched a no hitter against the Houston Astros.\n\nAt age twenty in 1968, Bench impressed many in his first full season. He won the National League Rookie of the Year Award and batted .275 with 15 home runs and 82 RBIs. This marked the first time that the award had been won by a catcher. He also won the 1968 National League Gold Glove Award for catchers, which was the first time that the award had been won by a rookie. He made 102 assists in 1968, which marked the first time in 23 years that a catcher had more than 100 assists in a season.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Bench also served in the United States Army Reserve as a member of the 478th Engineer Battalion, which was based across the Ohio River from Cincinnati at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. This unit included several of his teammates, among them Pete Rose. In the winter of 1970–1971 he was part of Bob Hope's USO Tour of Vietnam.\n\nThe year 1970 was Bench's finest statistical season. At age 22, he became the youngest player to win the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He hit .293, led the National League with 45 home runs and a franchise-record 148 runs batted in as the Reds won the NL West Division. The Reds swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Championship Series, but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in five games in the World Series.\n\nBench had another strong year in 1972, winning the MVP Award for a second time. He led the National League in home runs (40) and RBI (125) to help propel the Reds to another National League West Division title and won the NL pennant in the deciding fifth game over the Pittsburgh Pirates. One of his most dramatic home runs was likely his ninth-inning, lead off, opposite field home run in that fifth NLCS game. The solo shot tied the game at three; the Reds won later in the inning on a wild pitch, 4–3. It was hailed after the game as \"one of the great clutch home runs of all time.\" However, the Reds lost the World Series to a strong Oakland Athletics team in seven games.\n\nAfter the 1972 season, Bench had a growth removed from his lung; he remained productive, but never again hit forty home runs in a season. In 1973, Bench hit 25 home runs and 104 RBI and helped the Reds rally from a 10½-game deficit to the Los Angeles Dodgers in early July to lead the majors with 99 wins and claim another NL West Division crown. In the NLCS, Cincinnati met a New York Mets team that won the NL East with an unimpressive record, 16½ games behind the Reds. But the Mets boasted three of the better starting pitchers in the NL, future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Jon Matlack. Bench's bottom of the ninth-inning home run off Seaver in the first game propelled the Reds to victory, but Seaver would get the best of the Reds and Bench in the deciding Game 5, winning to put the Mets into the World Series.\n\nIn 1974, Bench led the league with 129 RBI and scored 108 runs, becoming only the fourth catcher in major league history with 100 or more runs and RBI in the same season. The Reds won the second-most games in the majors (98) but lost the West Division to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1975, the Reds finally broke through in the post season. Bench contributed 28 home runs and 110 RBI. Cincinnati swept the Pirates in three games to win the NLCS, and defeated the Boston Red Sox in a memorable seven-game World Series.\nBench struggled with ailing shoulders in 1976,\n\nBench bounced back in 1977 to hit 31 home runs and 109 RBIs but the Dodgers won two straight NL pennants. The Reds reached the postseason just once more in his career, in 1979, but were swept in three straight in the NLCS by the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nFor the last three seasons of his career, Bench moved out of the plate, catching only 13 games, while primarily becoming a corner infielder (first or third base). The Cincinnati Reds proclaimed Saturday, September 17, 1983, \"Johnny Bench Night\" at Riverfront Stadium, in which he hit his 389th and final home run, a line drive to left in the third inning before a record crowd. He retired at the end of the season at age 35.\n\nBench had 2,048 hits for a .267 career batting average with 389 home runs and 1,376 RBI during his 17-year Major League career, all spent with the Reds. He retired as the career home run leader for catchers, a record which stood until surpassed by Carlton Fisk and the current record holder, Mike Piazza. Bench still holds the Major League record for the most grand slam home runs by a catcher with 10. In his career, Bench earned 10 Gold Gloves, was named to the National League All-Star team 14 times, and won two Most Valuable Player Awards. He led the National League three times in caught stealing percentage and ended his career with a .991 fielding percentage. He caught 118 shutouts during his career, ranking him 12th all-time among major league catchers. Bench also won such awards as the Lou Gehrig Award (1975), the Babe Ruth Award (1976), and the Hutch Award (1981).\n\nBench popularized the hinged catcher's mitt, first introduced by Randy Hundley of the Chicago Cubs. He began using the mitt after a stint on the disabled list in 1966 for a thumb injury on his throwing hand. The mitt allowed Bench to tuck his throwing arm safely to the side when receiving the pitch. By the turn of the decade, the hinged mitt became standard catchers' equipment. Having huge hands (a famous photograph features him holding seven baseballs in his right hand), Bench also tended to block breaking balls in the dirt by scooping them with one hand instead of the more common and fundamentally proper way: dropping to both knees and blocking the ball using the chest protector to keep the ball in front.\n\nBench has been married four times. Once hailed as \"baseball's most-eligible bachelor,\" he shed that distinction before the 1975 season when he married Vickie Chesser, a toothpaste model who'd previously dated Joe Namath. Four days after they met, Bench proposed, and they were married on February 21, 1975. Quickly, the pair realized they were incompatible, especially after Johnny suggested Vickie accept \"Hustler\" magazine's offer for her to pose nude for $25,000. They broke up at the end of the season (Bench reportedly said to her, \"Now I'm done with two things I hate: baseball and you\"), divorcing after just 13 months. \"I tried. I even hand-squeezed orange juice,\" she told Phil Donahue in December 1975. \"I don't think either of us had any idea what marriage was really like.\" After returning to Manhattan, Vickie said, \"Johnny Bench is a great athlete, a mediocre everything else, and a true tragedy as a person.\" \n\nBefore Christmas 1987, Bench married Laura Cwikowski, an Oklahoma City model and aerobics instructor. They had a son, Bobby Binger Bench (named for Bob Hope and Bobby Knight, and Bench's hometown), before divorcing in 1995. They shared custody of the boy. \"He was, and is, a great dad,\" says Bobby, who works in Cincinnati as a production operator on Reds broadcasts. Bench's third marriage, to Elizabeth Benton, took place in 1997, while his fourth came in 2004, to 31-year-old Lauren Baiocchi, the daughter of pro golfer Hugh Baiocchi. After living in Palm Springs with their two sons, Justin (born 2006) and Josh (born 2010), Johnny had the urge to return to South Florida, where he lived from 2014-17, so the family scouted homes in Palm Beach Gardens. In the end, Lauren decided she wasn't going to move to Florida, so she and Johnny divorced; as of 2018, Bench has primary custody of the boys.\n\nBench was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1989 alongside Carl Yastrzemski. He was elected in his first year of eligibility, and appeared on 96% of the ballots, the third-highest percentage at that time. Three years earlier, Bench had been inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1986 and his uniform #5 was retired by the team. He is currently on the Board of Directors for the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. In 1989, he became the first individual baseball player to appear on a Wheaties box, a cereal he ate as a child.\n\nFor a time in the 1980s Bench was a commercial spokesman for Krylon paint, featuring a memorable catchphrase: \"I'm Johnny Bench, and this is Johnny Bench's bench.\" \n\nIn 1985, Bench starred as Joe Boyd/Joe Hardy in a Cincinnati stage production of the musical \"Damn Yankees\", which also included Gwen Verdon and Gary Sandy. He also hosted the television series \"The Baseball Bunch\" from 1982 to 1985. A cast of boys and girls from the Tucson, Arizona, area would learn the game of baseball from Bench and other current and retired greats. The Chicken provided comic relief and former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda appeared as \"The Dugout Wizard.\"\n\nIn 1986, Bench and Don Drysdale did the backup contests or ABC's Sunday afternoon baseball telecasts (Al Michaels and Jim Palmer were the primary commentating crew). Keith Jackson, usually working with Tim McCarver did the #2 Monday night games. Bench took a week off in June (with Steve Busby filling in), and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. While Drysdale worked the All-Star Game in Houston as an interviewer he did not resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to CBS Radio to help Brent Musburger call that year's National League Championship Series. Bench would later serve as color commentator CBS Radio's World Series coverage alongside Jack Buck and later Vin Scully from 1989-1993. In 1994, Bench served as a field reporter for NBC/The Baseball Network's coverage of the All-Star Game from Pittsburgh.\n\nAfter turning 50, Bench was a part-time professional golfer and played in several events on the Senior PGA Tour. He has a home at the Mission Hills-Gary Player Course in Rancho Mirage, California.\n\nIn 1999, Bench ranked Number 16 on \"The Sporting News\" list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was the highest-ranking catcher. Bench was also elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the top vote-receiving catcher. As part of the Golden Anniversary of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award, Bench was selected to the All-Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team.\n\nStarting with the 2000 college baseball season, the best collegiate catcher annually receives the Johnny Bench Award. Notable winners include Buster Posey of Florida State University, Kelly Shoppach of Baylor University, Ryan Garko of Stanford University, and Kurt Suzuki of Cal State Fullerton.\nIn 2008, Bench co-wrote the book \"Catch Every Ball: How to Handle Life's Pitches\" with Paul Daugherty, published by Orange Frazer Press. An autobiography published in 1979 called \"Catch You Later\" was co-authored with William Brashler. Bench has also broadcast games on television and radio, and is an avid golfer, having played in several Champions Tour tournaments.\n\nIn a September 2008 interview with Heidi Watney of the New England Sports Network, Johnny Bench, who was watching a Cleveland Indians/Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park, did an impression of late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray after Red Sox third baseman Kevin Youkilis, a native of Cincinnati, made a tough play. While knuckleballer Tim Wakefield was on the mound for the Red Sox, he related a story that then-Reds manager Sparky Anderson told him that he was thinking of trading for knuckleballer Phil Niekro. Bench replied that Anderson had better trade for Niekro's catcher, too.\n\nOn September 17, 2011, the Cincinnati Reds unveiled a statue of Bench at the entrance way of the Reds Hall of Fame at Great American Ball Park. The larger-than-life bronze statue by Tom Tsuchiya, shows Bench in the act of throwing out a base runner. Bench called the unveiling of his statue his \"greatest moment.\"\n\n"}

He also worked in films throughout his career, playing more than fifty cinema roles. From 1935 he performed in radio broadcasts and, from 1956, had considerable success in television roles.\n\nAfter attending drama school, Olivier began his professional career with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. In 1926 he joined the Birmingham Repertory Company, where he was given the chance to play a wide range of key roles. In 1930 he had his first important West End success in Noël Coward's \"Private Lives\", and in 1935 he played in a celebrated production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" alongside Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, and by the end of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and John Burrell, Olivier was the co-director of the Old Vic, building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's Richard III and Sophocles's Oedipus. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the \"avant garde\" English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in \"The Entertainer\". From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in \"Othello\" (1964) and Shylock in \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1970).\n\nIn 1930, to gain money for his forthcoming marriage, Olivier began his film career with small roles in two films. In 1939 he appeared as Heathcliff in \"Wuthering Heights\" in a role that saw him nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The following year he was again nominated for the same award for his portrayal of Maxim de Winter in \"Rebecca\". In 1944 he produced, directed and appeared as Henry V of England in \"Henry V\". There were Oscar nominations for the film, including Best Picture and Best Actor, but it won none and the film instead won a \"Special Award\". He won the Best Actor award for the 1948 film \"Hamlet\", which became the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. He later received Oscar nominations for roles in \"Richard III\" (1955), \"The Entertainer\" (1960), \"Othello\" (1965), \"Sleuth\" (1972), \"Marathon Man\" (1976) and \"The Boys from Brazil\" (1978). In 1979 he was also presented with an Honorary Award, at the Academy Awards, to recognise his lifetime of contribution to the art of film. He was nominated for nine other acting Oscars and one each for production and direction. Throughout his career Olivier appeared in radio dramas and poetry readings, and made his television debut in 1956.\n\nDuring the making of the 1983 movie \"The Jigsaw Man\" Olivier walked away from the film after receiving no pay, with Michael Caine following not long after. They returned only when $4 million was secured as finance by Pakistani businessman, filmmaker and best seller author Mahmud Sipra.\n\nAfter being ill for the last twenty-two years of his life, Olivier died of renal failure on 11 July 1989. In reflection, and about Olivier's pioneering of Britain's National Theatre, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg wrote: \"[N]o one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument\". Olivier's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in the words of the English theatre director Peter Hall, \"the supreme man of the theatre of our time\".\n\nThis table contains Olivier's known professional theatrical roles. It also contains the occasions when he both acted and directed. It does not contain those productions where he was a director but did not appear on stage.

Following a string of tabloid allegations about his personal life, he was dismissed in October 2002 after presenting two shows of the 24th series. Regular team captain Paul Merton stood in as the host of the first episode following Deayton's departure, following which the programme was presented by a different guest host each week (many of which have presented several editions of the show). This was initially intended as a short-term solution while producers were looking for a full-time replacement; however, having a different guest host each week proved successful, with average audience figures increasing from 6 million to 7 million.

Famous people who are simply rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed.\n\nThe historical concept and definition of sexual orientation varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the word \"gay\" wasn't used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term \"sexual orientation\" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies. However, most definitions include a psychological component (such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire) and/or a behavioural component (which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s). Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or identity. See homosexuality and bisexuality for criteria that have traditionally denoted lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people.\n\nThe high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to societal attitudes towards homosexuality. The Pew Research Center's 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that \"[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East. Majorities in every Western European nation surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society, while most Russians, Poles and Ukrainians disagree. Americans are divided – a thin majority (51 percent) believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 42 percent disagree.\"\n"}

Added to the U.S. in 1803 and shortly thereafter explored by Lewis and Clark, the territory was home to numerous Native American peoples for millennia. In the mid-19th century the discovery of gold and other valuable minerals led to successive mining booms. Settlement by farmers and ranchers expanded as railroads raced to build networks of tracks linking Montana to Utah to the south, Minneapolis to the east, and Seattle to the west. Montana produced numerous important politicians from both political parties, as well as entrepreneurs who founded cities and built large mining, timber, cattle and other related industries.

He remains a leading figure in British equestrian circles, a noted eventing course designer, and a columnist in \"Horse & Hound\" magazine.\n\nMark Phillips is the son of Major Peter William Garside Phillips, MC (1920–1998) and Anne Patricia Phillips (\"née\" Tiarks; 1926–1988); they married in 1946. Anne was educated at Downe House and served in the Women's Royal Naval Service during the Second World War. Her father John Gerhard Edward Tiarks (1896–1962), who served in the First and Second World Wars, attained the rank of Brigadier. John Tiarks was \"aide-de-camp\" to King George VI from 1947 to 1950.\n\nPhillips was educated at Stouts Hill Preparatory School near Uley, Gloucestershire, then at Marlborough College, then the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.\n\nUpon passing out from Sandhurst, Phillips was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant into the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards in July 1969, After the expected period, he was promoted to Lieutenant in January 1971. By the time of his wedding to Princess Anne in November 1973, Phillips was an acting Captain. In January 1974, he was appointed a Personal Aide-de-Camp to Queen Elizabeth II. Phillips was substantively promoted to Captain in July 1975, and retired from the Army on 30 March 1978.\n\nHe continued to style himself \"Captain\" Mark Phillips; retired cavalry captains are (unusually) allowed to use this honorific rank, if their job had mostly involved horses.\n\nPhillips was a reserve member of the British equestrian team for the 1968 Olympics. He was part of the British three-day event teams that won a world title in 1970, a European title in 1971 and Olympic gold medals in 1972; individually, he finished in 35th place in 1972. At the 1988 Olympics his horse sustained a pulled muscle and could not complete the individual three-day event, but Phillips won a silver medal with the British team. Phillips was a four-time champion at the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1971–72 on \"Great Ovation\", in 1974 on \"Colombus\" and in 1981 on \"Lincoln\". It was through his equestrian activities that he met Princess Anne, the only daughter of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Their own daughter Zara won a silver medal in the three-day event with the British team at the 2012 Olympics.\n\nIn 1998, Phillips designed the cross-country venue for the Red Hills Horse Trials, a qualifying event for the Olympics located in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. He is now a regular columnist for \"Horse & Hound\" magazine. He also remains a leading figure in British equestrian circles, and serves as \"Chef d'Equipe\" of the United States Eventing Team.\n\nPhillips married Princess Anne on 14 November 1973, at Westminster Abbey. They have two children: Peter (born 1977) and Zara (born 1981). It is believed that Phillips declined a peerage from the Queen which would have allowed his children to use courtesy titles. The Queen bought Gatcombe Park, near Minchinhampton, for the couple as a wedding present.\n\nThe Prince of Wales is believed to have originated the nickname \"Foggy\" on the grounds that he was \"thick and wet\". \n\nIn August 1985, Phillips fathered a daughter, Felicity, as a result of an extramarital affair with New Zealand art teacher Heather Tonkin. Phillips was confirmed as the father as a result of DNA testing during a paternity suit in 1991. In August 1989, the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips announced their intention to separate, as the marriage had been under strain for a number of years. The couple had been rarely seen in the public together, and both were romantically linked with other people. They continued to share the custody of their children, and initially announced that \"there were no plans for divorce.\" Meanwhile, Phillips continued to work at the couple's estate at Gatcombe Park. They divorced on 23 April 1992.\n\nOn 1 February 1997, Phillips married Sandy Pflueger, an American Olympic dressage rider. Their daughter Stephanie was born on 2 October 1997. On 3 May 2012, it was confirmed by Phillips' solicitors that Phillips and Pflueger had separated, intending to divorce.\n\nPhillips' personal wealth is thought to be in the range of £15–20 million, although he gained only a small settlement when his marriage to Anne, Princess Royal ended.\n\n\n\n"}

He is an authority on wine tasting and old wines.\n\nBroadbent was educated at Oundle School and trained as an architect but changed career, in 1952, at the age of twenty-five, and entered the wine trade first with Layton’s, next with the West End Wine merchants, Saccone and Speed, and, from 1955 with Harvey's of Bristol. In 1960 he received the qualification of Master of Wine.\n\nIn 1966 he resigned as Sales Director to start wine auctions at the London auction house Christie's which would lead him to trade in and taste a greater number of fine and rare wines than anyone else in the world. His tasting notes are estimated to number over 90,000 in more than 140 notebooks. Until 1992 he was the senior director of Christie's wine department, and he remained a senior consultant with the firm until 2009.\n\nBroadbent awards a wine up to five stars, a system unlike the numerical score of the American wine critic Robert Parker.\n\nAs a wine writer, Broadbent is noted for publications of his records from a life of tasting wine. \"The Great Vintage Wine Book\" is a reference work with tasting notes from more than 6,000 wines dating back to the 17th century. In addition to authoring several wine books, he has been a regular contributor to the wine magazines \"Vinum\" and \"Falstaff \", and still writes monthly for \"Decanter\" since its inception in 1975. Broadbent has lectured on the subject since the mid-1950s.\n\nIn 1979 Broadbent was appointed Chevalier of the Ordre National du Mérite, as well as an honorary member of the Académie du Vin de Bordeaux and numerous other French wine associations. Among other positions held, Broadbent has been chairman of The Institute of Masters of Wine in 1970, Master of the Worshipful Company of Distillers, president of The International Wine and Food Society in 1986, president of the Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET) 2007-2009 and Chairman of The Wine & Spirit Trades' Benevolent Society in 1991, and has stood as Sheriff of the City of London in 1993. In 2006 he participated as a judge in the 30th anniversary repetition of the original \"Judgment of Paris\" wine tasting competition.\n\nMichael Broadbent is widowed to the late Daphne Broadbent (1931-2015). Their son Bartholomew Broadbent is a wine importer in the United States who also makes Port, Madeira and Vinho Verde in Portugal and was a 50% owner of Dragon's Hollow winery in China. Michael Broadbent's daughter Emma, now The Lady Arbuthnot of Edrom, is the Senior Magistrate in England & Wales, married to The Right Honourable The Lord Arbuthnot of Edrom James Arbuthnot, MP.\n\nBroadbent was also among the wine industry experts whose association with alleged wine forger Hardy Rodenstock during the 1980s led to some embarrassment. In July 2009 it was announced that Broadbent would sue Random House, the publishers of \"The Billionaire's Vinegar\" by Benjamin Wallace, an account of the \"Jefferson bottles affair\" and its court cases, for defamation of character, on claims that the book asserts Broadbent invented an auction bid and contains references to him colluding with Rodenstock. The suit was filed in the United Kingdom, and Random House initially stated it did not believe it had defamed Broadbent and would defend the lawsuit.\n\nIn October 2009, Random House accepted that the allegations in the book were without foundation, removed the book from sale in the UK, made a full apology and paid Broadbent an undisclosed sum in damages. It was also reported that Wallace was not a party to the lawsuit or settlement, that Random House would be making no changes to the book, and that it would continue to publish the book in all territories outside the jurisdiction of the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jacob Aboab, however, in a letter to Unger (Wolf, \"Bibl. Hebr.\" iii., No. 1728), gives Pieve di Sacco, Italy, as the place of Hannover's death, without indicating the date. The place of his birth is equally uncertain. According to Graziadio Nepi-Mordecai Ghirondi, (\"Toledot Gedole Yisrael,\" p. 270) he was born at Cracow, but Steinschneider says that Nathan Hannover and Nathan of Cracow were two different persons.\n\nHannover lived for a time at Zaslav, Volhynia, and when that town was attacked by the Cossacks he fled from Poland. He went first to Prague, then to Venice, where he studied Cabala under Hayyim Cohen, Moses Zacuto, and Samuel Aboab. Later he became rabbi of Iaşi, Moldavia, and afterward, according to Jacob Aboab, he returned to Italy.\n\nHannover is chiefly known for his work entitled \"Yeven Mezulah\" (Venice, 1653), which describes the course of the Khmelnytsky Uprising in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from a Jewish perspective. Hannover in this work gives a brief description of the Polish government of the time and of the relations between the Poles, Jews and Cossacks, and the causes which led to the uprising. He also gives a very vivid picture of Jewish life in Poland and the yeshivot.\n\nThis work, owing to its literary value, was translated into Yiddish (1687), into German (1720), and into French by Daniel Levy (published by Benjamin II, Tlemçen, 1855). This last translation was revised by the historian J. Lelewel, and served as a basis for Meyer Kayserling's German translation (also published by Benjamin II, Hanover, 1863). Kostomarov, utilizing Salomon Mandelkern's Russian translation, gives many extracts from it in his \"Bogdan Chmielnicki\" (iii. 283-306).\n\n\"Yeven Mezulah\" came under criticism in the late 20th century, due to its severe overstatment of casualties during the Bohdan Khmelnytsky rebellion in 1648 and 1649, and it is no longer considered a reliable historical source in spite of its literary qualities. \"Yeven Mezulah\" was criticized in particular by Shaul Stampfer, Edward Fram, Paul Robert Magocsi's \"Ukraine: A History\", and Petro Mirchuk.\n\nHannover's other works are: \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "151532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151532", "title": "Norman Wisdom", "text": "Norman Wisdom\n\nSir Norman Joseph Wisdom, (4 February 1915 – 4 October 2010) was an English actor, comedian, and singer-songwriter best known for a series of comedy films produced between 1953 and 1966 featuring his hapless onscreen character that was often called Norman Pitkin. He was awarded the 1953 BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles following the release of \"Trouble in Store\", his first film in a lead role.\n\nWisdom gained celebrity status in lands as far apart as South America, Iran and many Eastern Bloc countries, particularly in Albania where his films were the only ones by Western actors permitted by dictator Enver Hoxha to be shown. Charlie Chaplin once referred to Wisdom as his \"favourite clown\".\n\nWisdom later forged a career on Broadway in New York and as a television actor, winning critical acclaim for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play \"Going Gently\" in 1981. He toured Australia and South Africa. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, a hospice was named in his honour. In 1995 he was given the Freedom of the City of London and of Tirana. The same year he was appointed OBE.\n\nNorman Joseph Wisdom was born in the Marylebone district of London. His parents were Frederick, a chauffeur, and Maud Wisdom (née Targett), a dressmaker who often worked for West End theatres, and had made a dress for Queen Mary. The couple married in Marylebone on 15 July 1912. Wisdom had an elder brother, Frederick Thomas \"Fred\" Wisdom (13 December 1912 – 1 July 1971).\n\nThe family lived at 91 Fernhead Road, Maida Vale, London W9, where they slept in one room. He and his brother were raised in extreme poverty and were frequently hit by their father.\n\nAfter a period in a children's home in Deal, Kent, Wisdom ran away when he was 11 but returned to become an errand boy in a grocer's shop on leaving school at 13. Having been kicked out of his home by his father and become homeless, in 1929 he walked (by his own account) to Cardiff, Wales, where he became a cabin boy in the Merchant Navy. He later also worked as a coal miner, waiter and page boy.\n\nWisdom first enlisted into the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), but his mother had him discharged as he was under age. He later re-enlisted as a drummer boy in the 10th Royal Hussars of the British Army. In 1930, he was posted to Lucknow, in the United Provinces of British India, as a bandsman. There he rode horses, became the flyweight boxing champion of the British Army in India and learned to play the trumpet and clarinet.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Wisdom was sent to work in a communications centre in a command bunker in London, where he connected telephone calls from war leaders to the prime minister. He met Winston Churchill on several occasions when asked for updates on incoming calls, Wisdom then joined the Royal Corps of Signals, and performed a similar military function at the unit headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.\n\nWhilst performing a shadow boxing routine in an army gym, Wisdom discovered he had a talent for entertainment, and began to develop his skills as a musician and stage entertainer. In 1940 aged 25, at a NAAFI entertainment night, during a dance routine, Wisdom stepped down from his position in the orchestra pit, and started shadow boxing. Hearing his colleagues and officers giggling, he broke into a duck waddle, followed by a series of facial expressions. He later described the reaction as: \"They were in hysterics. All the officers were falling about laughing.\"\n\nWisdom later said this was where he first patented his persona as \"The Successful Failure\". Over the next few years, until he was demobilized in 1945, his routine included his characteristic singing and the trip-up-and-stumble. After Wisdom appeared at a charity concert at Cheltenham Town Hall, actor Rex Harrison came backstage and urged him to become a professional entertainer.\n\nAfter being demobilised Wisdom worked as a private hire car driver. Having improved his diction in the army, he also took a job as a night telephone operator.\n\nWisdom made his debut as a professional entertainer at the age of 31; his rise to the top was phenomenally fast. Initially the straight man to the magician David Nixon, he had already adopted the costume that would remain his trademark: tweed flat cap askew, with peak turned up; a suit at least two sizes too tight; a crumpled collar and a mangled tie. The character that went with this costume—known as \"the Gump\"—was to dominate Wisdom's film career. A West End theatre star within two years, he honed his performance skills mainly between theatres in London and Brighton:\nWisdom made his TV debut in 1948 and was soon commanding enormous audiences and had a small film role in \"A Date with a Dream\" released in the same year.\n\nWisdom made a series of low-budget star-vehicle comedies for the Rank Organisation, beginning with \"Trouble in Store\" (1953). This film earned him a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Film in 1954. It was the second most popular film at the British box-office in 1954 and exhibitors voted him the tenth biggest star at the British box office the same year.\n\nHis films' cheerful, unpretentious appeal make them the direct descendants of those made a generation earlier by George Formby. Never highly thought of by the critics, they were very popular with domestic audiences and Wisdom's films were among Britain's biggest box-office successes of their day. They were also successful in some unlikely overseas markets, helping Rank stay afloat financially when their more expensive film projects were unsuccessful.\n\nThe films usually involved the Gump character, usually called Norman, in a manual occupation in which he is barely competent and in a junior position to a straight man, often played by Edward Chapman (as Mr Grimsdale) or Jerry Desmonde. They benefited from Wisdom's capacity for physical slapstick comedy and his skill at creating a sense of the character's helplessness. The series often contained a romantic subplot; the Gump's inevitable awkwardness with women is a characteristic shared with the earlier Formby vehicles. His innocent incompetence still made him endearing to the heroine.\nWisdom's second film as star, \"One Good Turn\" (1955), was the seventh most popular movie of 1955 in Britain. He made a cameo in \"As Long as They're Happy\" (1955) then returned in \"Man of the Moment\" (1955). He was the 6th most popular star of 1955.\n\nWisdom was a window cleaner in \"Up in the World\" (1956) and worked in a jewellery store in \"Just My Luck\" (1957). The box office receipts of these last few films had declined from previous Wisdom films but \"The Square Peg\" (1959), an army comedy, reversed the trend and was one of the year's biggest hits. The film was the 7th most popular movie at the British box office in 1959. Less successful was \"Follow a Star\" (1959). \"There Was a Crooked Man\" (1960) was an attempt to change Wisdom's image away from Rank Organisation. \"The Bulldog Breed\" (1960) was more conventional. The film also starred a young Michael Caine who later recalled he not enjoy working with Wisdom because he \"wasn't very nice to support-part actors\".\nWisdom remained the 10th biggest star at the British box office.\n\nWisdom was in \"The Girl on the Boat\" (1961) from a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, a second film away from the Rank formula. \"On the Beat\" (1962) as a car cleaner. and \"A Stitch in Time\" (1963), in which he was cast as an apprentice butcher, returned him to the regular format.\n\n\"The Early Bird\" (1965), his first colour film, had Wisdom as a milkman. After a cameo in \"The Sandwich Man\" (1966), Wisdom starred in \"Press for Time\" (1966), the last film in this sequence of starring vehicles. Wisdom was still voted the 5th most popular star at the British box office.\n\nWhilst Wisdom's stage performances often involved musical numbers, he wrote only a few of them. He has seven songs attributed to him in the ASCAP database, which are: \"Beware\", \"Don't Laugh at Me ('cause I'm a Fool)\", \"Falling in Love\", \"Follow a Star\", \"I Love You\", \"Please Opportunity\", and \"Up in the World\".\n\nIn 1966, Wisdom spent a short period in the United States to star in a Broadway production of the Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn musical comedy \"Walking Happy\". His performance was nominated for a Tony Award.\n\nThis led to Wisdom's being cast in his first Hollywood movie, \"The Night They Raided Minsky's\" (1968). Back in England he tried to change his image slightly in \"What's Good for the Goose\" (1969), which featured a topless scene, but it was financially unsuccessful.\n\nWisdom was one of several actors initially considered for the role of Frank Spencer in \"Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em\", however he turned the role down and it eventually went to Michael Crawford. The creator of the series Raymond Allen later stated \"Norman Wisdom was offered the role but turned it down because he didn't find it funny\".\n\nOn 31 December 1976, Wisdom performed his theme song \"Don't Laugh at Me ('cause I'm a Fool)\" on BBC1's \"A Jubilee of Music\", celebrating British pop music for Queen Elizabeth II's impending Silver Jubilee. Wisdom had performed in front of the Queen at many Royal Command Performances, the first being in 1952.\n\nHe also completed his first American film as a vaudeville comic in \"The Night They Raided Minsky's\". After a typical performance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", further US opportunities were denied him when he had to return to London after his second wife left him. His subsequent career was largely confined to television, and he toured the world with a successful cabaret act. He won critical acclaim in 1981 for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play \"Going Gently\".\n\nAfter touring South Africa and Australia with some success, his appearances in Britain became more infrequent. He spent much of the 1980s in seclusion on the Isle of Man.\n\nWisdom's career revived in the 1990s, helped by the young comedian Lee Evans, whose act was often compared to Wisdom's work. His films for Rank were playing to new audiences via television screenings, with young fans in the United Kingdom and abroad. The high point of this new popularity was the knighthood he was awarded, for services to entertainment, in the 2000 New Year's honours list. During the ceremony, once he had received his knighthood, he walked away and again performed his trademark trip, at which the Queen smiled and laughed.\n\nFrom 1995 until 2004 he appeared in the recurring role of Billy Ingleton in the long-running BBC comedy \"Last of the Summer Wine\". The role was originally a one-off appearance, but proved so popular that he returned as the character on a number of occasions. In 1996, he received a Special Achievement Award from the London Film Critics.\n\nWisdom was a guest on a \"This Is Your Life\" special in 2000 for actor and director Todd Carty. He appeared as a half-time guest at the England vs Albania 2002 World Cup qualifier at St James' Park, Newcastle upon Tyne, and scored a penalty at the Leazes End.\n\nIn 2002 Wisdom filmed a cameo role as a butler in a low-budget horror film. In 2004, he made an appearance on \"Coronation Street,\" playing fitness fanatic pensioner Ernie Crabbe. In 2007 he came out of retirement to take a role in a short film called \"Expresso\".\n\nWisdom was a well-known performer in Albania, where he was one of the few Western actors whose films were allowed in the country during the dictatorship of Enver Hoxha. From Hoxha's misconceived view, proletarian Norman's ultimately victorious struggles against capitalism, personified by Mr Grimsdale and the effete aristocratic characters played by Jerry Desmonde, were a Communist parable on the class war. He was known as \"Mr Pitkin\" after the character from his films. In 1995, he visited the post-Stalinist country where, to his surprise, he was greeted by many appreciative fans, including the then President, Sali Berisha. During this trip, Wisdom was filmed by \"Newsnight\" as he visited a children's project funded by ChildHope UK.\n\nOn a visit in 2001, which coincided with the England football team playing Albania in the city of Tirana, his appearance at the training ground overshadowed that of David Beckham. He appeared on the pitch before the start of the Albania v England match wearing a half-Albanian and half-English football shirt. He was well received by the crowd, especially when he performed one of his trademark trips on his way out to the centre circle. In 1995 Wisdom was made an honorary citizen of Tirana.\n\nIn his book and TV series \"One Hit Wonderland\", Tony Hawks united with Wisdom and, along with Tim Rice, released a single, \"Big in Albania\", in an attempt to enter the Albanian pop charts. It reached number 18 on the Top Albania Radio chart.\n\nIn October 2004 Wisdom announced he would retire from the entertainment industry on his 90th birthday (4 February 2005). He announced that he intended to spend more time with his family, playing golf and driving around the Isle of Man, where he was living.\n\nIn 2007, Wisdom returned to acting in a short film directed by Kevin Powis, \"Expresso\". The film, which Wisdom later announced (reported BBC/ITV News) was to be officially his last film role, is set during one day in a coffee shop and was funded by the UK Film Council and ScreenWM. Shot in January, it premièred at the Cannes Film Festival on 27 May 2007. It was later adopted by the UK charity Macmillan and released on DVD in aid of the charity.\n\nIn the film Wisdom plays a vicar plagued by a fly in a café. Producer Nigel Martin Davey gave him only a visual role so that he would not have to remember any lines, but on the day Wisdom was alert and had his performance changed to add more laughs.\n\nWisdom was married twice. His first wife was Doreen Brett, whom he married in 1941. By 1944 they had separated when Doreen gave birth to a son, Michael (born 1944), fathered by Albert Gerald Hardwick, a telephone engineer. The marriage was dissolved in 1946.\n\nHe married his second wife, Freda Isobel Simpson in 1947; they had two children: Nicholas (born 1953, who later played first-class cricket for Sussex) and Jacqueline (born 1954). The couple divorced in 1969, with Wisdom granted full custody of the children. Freda Wisdom died in Brighton in 1992.\n\nPopular in the Isle of Man, he lived for 27 years in a house in Andreas named Ballalough (Manx language for \"lake farm\", also a humorous corruption of the English \"belly laugh\"). A supporter of various charities including Mencap, in 2005 Wisdom starred in a video for the Manx girl group Twisted Angels, for their single \"LA\", in support of the local charity Project 21.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he was involved in a famous legal case (\"Wisdom v Chamberlain\", 1968) in which he was pursued by the Inland Revenue for tax on profits made from the sale of silver bullion he had bought when concerned about the further devaluation of sterling. He contended that it was an investment but the court held that it had been a trading venture and was duly chargeable to income tax.\n\nWisdom was a lifelong supporter and a former board member of football team Brighton and Hove Albion. He also liked Everton and Newcastle United. He enjoyed golf, and was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats. He was an honorary member of the Winkle Club, a charity in Hastings, East Sussex.\n\nA lover of cars, his collection included a 1956 Bentley S1 Continental R Type fastback, which he first bought in 1961, and then again in the late 1980s. In 1969, he purchased, after the divorce from Freda Simpson, a Shelby Cobra 427, CSX3206, in New York, which he kept until 1986, when it was sold to another car enthusiast in Brighton, UK. Until his age and declining mental health meant he failed a Department of Transport fitness-to-drive test, he owned and drove a 1987 Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit and a Jaguar S-Type, which were sold in September 2005.\n\nIn 1963, he bought a new motor yacht. The long hull and superstructure were built in Spain for £80,000, before being towed to Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, for fitting-out. After three years of extensive works and sea trials, she was named M/Y \"Conquest\" and valued at £1.25 million by insurers. It was available for charter at £6,000 a month but Wisdom later sold it, saying that he was \"no sailor\".\n\nActress Fenella Fielding, who worked with Wisdom on his 1959 film \"Follow a Star\", said he was \"not a very pleasant man. Always making a pass – hand up your skirt first thing in the morning. Not exactly a lovely way to start a day's filming.\" Lynda Bellingham, who worked with Wisdom on \"A Little Bit of Wisdom\", recalled a comedy sketch where \"for ten minutes I stood there while he basically touched me up and you couldn't say anything because he was the master of comedy.\" Singer Tina Charles, who had a number one with \"I Love To Love\" in 1976, alleged that Wisdom molested her in his dressing room when she was 16.\n\nIn mid-2006, after he suffered an irregular heart rhythm, Wisdom was flown by helicopter to hospital in Liverpool and was fitted with a heart pacemaker.\n\nIn August 2007, newspapers of the Daily Mail and General Trust group and the Isle of Man Newspapers reported that Wisdom was in the Abbotswood nursing home in Ballasalla, where he had been resident from 12 July 2007.\n\nOn the release of \"Expresso\" to DVD in the same month, BBC News confirmed that Wisdom lived in a care home, because of his suffering from vascular dementia. It was also reported that he had granted his children power of attorney over his affairs and, having sold off his flat in Epsom, Surrey, they were now in the process of selling his Isle of Man home to raise money to fund his longer term care.\n\nIn an exclusive interview on 27 August 2007 with the \"News of the World\", journalists were given access to Wisdom's room at the home. He said he was happy and content in a routine which his family and carers considered kept him safe in spite of the memory losses associated with his condition.\n\nOn 16 January 2008, BBC2 aired \"Wonderland: The Secret Life Of Norman Wisdom Aged 92 and 3/4.\" The documentary highlighted the dilemma of coping with an ageing parent. His family said that Wisdom's memory loss had become so severe that he no longer recognised himself in his films.\n\nIn the six months prior to his death, Wisdom suffered a series of strokes, causing a decline in his physical and mental health. He died on 4 October 2010 at Abbotswood nursing home on the Isle of Man at the age of 95.\n\nHis publicist, Phil Day, said, \"I have never met anyone in the profession who didn't like him, right up to royalty.\"\n\nHis funeral took place on 22 October 2010 in Douglas, Isle of Man, and all of the island were invited. His trademark cloth cap was placed on the coffin in the church. The funeral was attended by a large number of showbusiness personalities and, at Wisdom's request, Moira Anderson sang \"Who Can I Turn To\", which was specially arranged for the occasion by Gordon Cree. Wisdom's body was buried at Kirk Bride Churchyard, Bride, Isle of Man.\n\n\n\nFor a number of years British exhibitors voted Wisdom one of the most popular stars in the country.\n\n\n\n"}

Her talent earned her a place in the 1982 edition of \"The Guinness Book of World Records\".\n\nAs a writer, Shakuntala Devi wrote a number of books, including novels as well as texts about mathematics, puzzles, and astrology. She wrote the book, \"The World of Homosexuals\", which is considered the first study of homosexuality in India. She treated homosexuality in an understanding light and is considered a pioneer in the field.\n\nShakuntala Devi was born in Bangalore, Madras province, British India, to an orthodox Brahmin family. Her father rebelled against becoming a temple priest and instead joined a circus where he worked as a trapeze artist, lion tamer, tightrope walker and magician. He discovered his daughter's ability to memorise numbers while teaching her a card trick when she was about three years old. Her father left the circus and took her on road shows that displayed her ability at calculation. She did this without any formal education. At the age of six, she demonstrated her arithmetic abilities at the University of Mysore.\n\nIn 1944, Shakuntala Devi moved to London with her father.\n\nShakuntala Devi travelled the world demonstrating her arithmetic talents, including a tour of Europe in 1950 and a performance in New York City in 1976. In 1988, she travelled to the US to have her abilities studied by Arthur Jensen, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Jensen tested her performance of several tasks, including the calculation of large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the cube root of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Jensen reported that Shakuntala Devi provided the solution to the above mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy them down in his notebook. Jensen published his findings in the academic journal \"Intelligence\" in 1990.\n\nIn 1977, at Southern Methodist University, she gave the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in 50 seconds. Her answer—546,372,891—was confirmed by calculations done at the US Bureau of Standards by the UNIVAC 1101 computer, for which a special program had to be written to perform such a large calculation.\n\nOn 18 June 1980, she demonstrated the multiplication of two 13-digit numbers—7,686,369,774,870 × 2,465,099,745,779—picked at random by the Computer Department of Imperial College London. She correctly answered 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730 in 28 seconds. This event was recorded in the 1982 \"Guinness Book of Records\". Writer Steven Smith said, \"the result is so far superior to anything previously reported that it can only be described as unbelievable\".\n\nShakuntala Devi explained many of the methods she used to do mental calculations in her book 'Figuring: The Joy of Numbers', that is still in print. See the Works section below.\n\nIn 1977, she wrote \"The World of Homosexuals\", the first study of homosexuality in India. In the documentary \"For Straights Only\", she said that her interest in the topic came out of her marriage to a homosexual man and her desire to look at homosexuality more closely to understand it.\n\nThe book, considered \"pioneering\", features interviews with two young Indian homosexual men, a male couple in Canada seeking legal marriage, a temple priest who explains his views on homosexuality, and a review of the existing literature on homosexuality. It ends with a call for decriminalization of homosexuality, and \"full and complete acceptance—not tolerance and sympathy\". The book, however, went mostly unnoticed at that time.\n\nShe returned to India in the mid-1960s and married Paritosh Banerji, an officer of the Indian Administrative Service from Kolkata. They were divorced in 1979. In 1980, she contested in the Lok Sabha elections as an independent, from Mumbai South and from Medak in part of Telangana ( presently ). In Medak she stood against Indira Gandhi, saying she wanted to \"defend the people of Medak from being fooled by Mrs. Gandhi\"; she stood ninth, with 6514 votes (1.47% of the votes). Shakuntala Devi returned to Bengaluru in the early 1980s.\n\nIn addition to her work as a mental calculator, Devi was an astrologer and an author of several books, including cookbooks and novels.\n\nIn April 2013, Shakuntala Devi was admitted to a hospital in Bengaluru with respiratory problems. Over the following two weeks she suffered from complications of the heart and kidneys. She died in the hospital on 21 April 2013. She was 83 years old then. She is survived by her daughter, Anupama Banerjee.\n\nOn 4 November 2013, Shakuntala Devi was honoured with a Google Doodle for what would have been her 84th birthday (https://www.google.com/doodles/shakuntala-devis-84th-birthday).\n\nSome of her books are:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38889", "title": "Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor", "text": "Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor\n\nSigismund of Luxembourg (15 February 1368 in Nuremberg – 9 December 1437 in Znaim, Moravia) was Prince-elector of Brandenburg from 1378 until 1388 and from 1411 until 1415, King of Hungary and Croatia from 1387, King of Germany from 1411, King of Bohemia from 1419, King of Italy from 1431, and Holy Roman Emperor from 1433 until 1437, and the last male member of the House of Luxembourg. In 1396 he led the disastrous Crusade of Nicopolis, which attempted to liberate Bulgaria from Ottoman rule. Afterwards, he founded the Order of the Dragon to fight the Turks. He was regarded as highly educated, spoke several languages (among them French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin) and was an outgoing person who also took pleasure in the tournament. Sigismund was one of the driving forces behind the Council of Constance that ended the Papal Schism, but which also led to the Hussite Wars that dominated the later period of Sigismund's life.\n\nBorn in Nuremberg, Sigismund was the son of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV, and of his fourth wife, Elizabeth of Pomerania, who was the granddaughter of King Casimir III of Poland and the great-granddaughter of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Gediminas. He was named after Saint Sigismund of Burgundy, the favourite saint of Sigismund's father. From Sigismund's childhood he was nicknamed the \"ginger fox\" (\"liška ryšavá\") in the Crown of Bohemia, on account of his hair colour.\n\nKing Louis the Great of Hungary and Poland always had a good and close relationship with Emperor Charles IV, and Sigismund was betrothed to Louis' eldest daughter, Mary, in 1374, when he was six years old. Upon his father's death in 1378, young Sigismund became Margrave of Brandenburg and was sent to the Hungarian court, where he soon learnt the Hungarian language and way of life, and became entirely devoted to his adopted country. King Louis named him as his heir and appointed him his successor as King of Hungary.\n\nIn 1381, the then 13-year-old Sigismund was sent to Kraków by his eldest half-brother and guardian Wenceslaus, King of Germany and Bohemia, to learn Polish and to become acquainted with the land and its people. King Wenceslaus also gave him Neumark to facilitate communication between Brandenburg and Poland.\n\nThe disagreement between Polish landlords of Lesser Poland on one side and landlords of Greater Poland on the other, regarding the choice of the future King of Poland, finally ended in choosing the Lithuanian side. The support of the lords of Greater Poland was however not enough to give Prince Sigismund the Polish crown. Instead, the landlords of Lesser Poland gave it to Mary's younger sister Jadwiga I of Poland, who married Jogaila of Lithuania.\n\nOn the death of her father in 1382, his betrothed, Mary, became queen of Hungary and Sigismund married her in 1385 in Zólyom (today Zvolen). The next year, he was accepted as Mary's future co-ruler by the Treaty of Győr. However, Mary was captured, together with her mother, Elizabeth of Bosnia, who had acted as regent, in 1387 by the rebellious House of Horvat, Bishop Paul Horvat of Mačva, his brother John Horvat and younger brother Ladislav. Sigismund's mother-in-law was strangled, while Mary was liberated.\n\nHaving secured the support of the nobility, Sigismund was crowned King of Hungary at Székesfehérvár on 31 March 1387. Having raised money by pledging Brandenburg to his cousin Jobst, margrave of Moravia (1388), he was engaged for the next nine years in a ceaseless struggle for the possession of this unstable throne. The central power was finally weakened to such an extent that only Sigismund's alliance with the powerful Czillei-Garai League could ensure his position on the throne. It was not for entirely selfless reasons that one of the leagues of barons helped him to power: Sigismund had to pay for the support of the lords by transferring a sizeable part of the royal properties. (For some years, the baron's council governed the country in the name of the Holy Crown). The restoration of the authority of the central administration took decades of work. The bulk of the nation headed by the House of Garai was with him; but in the southern provinces between the Sava and the Drava, the Horvathys with the support of King Tvrtko I of Bosnia, Mary's maternal uncle, proclaimed as their king Ladislaus, king of Naples, son of the murdered Charles II of Hungary. Not until 1395 did Nicholas II Garay succeed in suppressing them. Mary died heavily pregnant in 1395.\n\nTo ease the pressure from Hungarian nobles, Sigismund tried to employ foreign advisors, which was not popular, and he had to promise not to give land and nominations to other than Hungarian nobles. However, this was not applied to Stibor of Stiboricz, who was Sigismund's closest friend and advisor. On a number of occasions, Sigismund was imprisoned by nobles, but with help of the armies of Garai and Stibor of Stiboricz, he would regain power.\n\nIn 1396, Sigismund led the combined armies of Christendom against the Turks, who had taken advantage of the temporary helplessness of Hungary to extend their dominion to the banks of the Danube. This crusade, preached by Pope Boniface IX, was very popular in Hungary. The nobles flocked in their thousands to the royal standard, and were reinforced by volunteers from nearly every part of Europe. The most important contingent being that of the French led by John the Fearless, son of Philip II, Duke of Burgundy. Sigismund set out with 90,000 men and a flotilla of 70 galleys. After capturing Vidin, he camped with his Hungarian armies before the fortress of Nicopolis. Sultan Bayezid I raised the siege of Constantinople and, at the head of 140,000 men, completely defeated the Christian forces in the Battle of Nicopolis fought between the 25 and 28 September 1396. Sigismund returned by sea and through the realm of Zeta, where he ordained a local Montenegrin lord Đurađ II with the islands of Hvar and Korčula for resistance against the Turks; the islands were returned to Sigismund after Đurađ's death in April 1403.\n\nThe disaster at Nicopolis angered several Hungarian lords, leading to instability in the kingdom. Deprived of his authority in Hungary, Sigismund then turned his attention to securing the succession in Germany and Bohemia, and was recognized by his childless half-brother Wenceslaus IV as Vicar-General of the whole Empire. However, he was unable to support Wenceslaus when he was deposed in 1400, and Rupert of Germany, Elector Palatine, was elected German king in his stead.\n\nOn his return to Hungary in 1401, Sigismund was imprisoned once and deposed twice. In 1401, Sigismund helped an uprising against Wenceslaus, during the course of which the Bohemian king was taken prisoner, and Sigismund ruled Bohemia for nineteen months. He released Wenceslaus in 1403. In the meantime, a group of Hungarian noblemen swore loyalty to the last Anjou monarch, Ladislaus of Naples, putting their hands on the relic of Saint Ladislas of Hungary in Nagyvárad. Ladislaus was the son of the murdered Charles II of Hungary, and thus a distant relative of the long dead King Louis I of Hungary. Ladislaus captured Zadar in 1403, but soon stopped any military advance. This struggle in turn led to a war with the Republic of Venice, as Ladislaus had sold the Dalmatian cities to the Venetians for 100,000 ducats before leaving for his own land. In the following years Sigismund acted indirectly to thwart Ladislaus' attempts to conquer central Italy, by allying with the Italian cities resisting him and by applying diplomatic pressure on him.\n\nDue to his frequent absences attending to business in the other countries over which he ruled, he was obliged to consult Diets in Hungary with more frequency than his predecessors and institute the office of Palatine as chief administrator while he was away.\nIn 1404, Sigismund introduced the \"Placetum Regium\". According to this decree, Papal bulls could not be pronounced in Hungary without the consent of the king.\n\nDuring his long reign, the royal castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages.\n\nIn about 1406, Sigismund married Mary's cousin Barbara of Celje (Barbara Celjska, nicknamed the \"Messalina of Germany\"), daughter of Count Hermann II of Celje. Hermann's mother Katarina Kotromanić (of the House of Kotromanic) and Mary's mother Queen Elizabeta (Elisabeth of Bosnia) were sisters, or cousins who were adoptive sisters. Tvrtko I was their first cousin and adopted brother, and perhaps even became heir apparent to Queen Mary. Tvrtko may have been murdered in 1391 on Sigismund's order.\n\nSigismund managed to establish control in Slavonia. He did not hesitate to use violent methods (see Bloody Sabor of Križevci), but from the river Sava to the south his control was weak. Sigismund personally led an army of almost 50,000 \"crusaders\" against the Bosnians, culminating with the Battle of Dobor in 1408, a massacre of about 200 noble families.\n\nSigismund founded his personal order of knights, the Order of the Dragon, after the victory at Dobor. The main goal of the order was fighting the Ottoman Empire. Members of the order were mostly his political allies and supporters. The main members of the order were Sigismund's close allies Nicholas II Garay, Hermann II of Celje, Stibor of Stiboricz, and Pippo Spano. The most important European monarchs became members of the order. He encouraged international trade by abolishing internal duties, regulating tariffs on foreign goods and standardizing weights and measures throughout the country.\n\nAfter the death of King Rupert of Germany in 1410, Sigismund – ignoring the claims of his half-brother Wenceslaus – was elected as successor by three of the electors on 10 September 1410, but he was opposed by his cousin Jobst of Moravia, who had been elected by four electors in a different election on 1 October. Jobst's death 18 January 1411 removed this conflict and Sigismund was again elected king on 21 July 1411. His coronation was deferred until 8 November 1414, when it took place at Aachen.\n\nOn a number of occasions, and in 1410 in particular, Sigismund allied himself with the Teutonic Knights against Władysław II of Poland. In return for 300.000 ducats he would attack Poland from the south after the truce on St. John's Day, 24 June expired. Sigismund ordered his most loyal friend Stibor of Stiboricz to set up the attack on Poland. Stibor of Stiboricz was of Polish origin and from the main line of the powerful Clan of Ostoja that had also been against choosing Jagiello as King of Poland. With the support of Sigismund, Stibor become one of the most influential men in late medieval Europe, holding titles as Duke of Transylvania and owning about 25% of modern-day Slovakia, including 31 castles of which 15 were situated around the 406 km long Váh river with surrounding land that was given to him by Sigismund. In the diplomatic struggle to prevent war between Poland-Lithuania, which was supported by the Muscovites, and the Teutonic Knights, Sigismund used Stibor's fine diplomacy to gain financially. The Polish side appointed several negotiators and most of them were also from the Clan of Ostoja, distant relations of the Stibors. However, those \"family meetings\" could not prevent the war and an alliance of twenty-two western states formed an army against Poland in the Battle of Grunwald in July 1410. Stibor attacked then Nowy Sącz and burned it to the ground, but after that he returned with his army back to the Beckov Castle. After the Polish-Lithuanian victory in the Battle of Grunwald, the Teutonic knights had to pay a huge sum of silver to Poland as reparation and again, through diplomacy of his friend Stibor, Sigismund was able to borrow all this silver from King Władysław II of Poland on good conditions. In the light of facts about the diplomatic work of Stibor and the Clan of Ostoja that was following the politics of King Sigismund, one can question whether Sigismund actually joined the anti-Polish alliance.\n\nFrom 1412 to 1423, Sigismund campaigned against the Venetians in Italy. The king took advantage of the difficulties of Antipope John XXIII to obtain a promise that a council should be called in Constance in 1414 to settle the Western Schism. He took a leading part in the deliberations of this assembly, and during the sittings made a journey to France, England and Burgundy in a vain attempt to secure the abdication of the three rival popes. The council ended in 1418, solving the Schism and — of great consequence to Sigismund's future career — having the Czech religious reformer, Jan Hus, burned at the stake for heresy in July 1415. The complicity of Sigismund in the death of Hus is a matter of controversy. He had granted him a safe-conduct and protested against his imprisonment; and the reformer was burned during his absence.\n\nIt was also at this Council that a cardinal ventured to correct Sigismund's Latin (he had construed the word \"schisma\" as feminine rather than neuter). To this Sigismund replied, in Latin:\nThis utterance prompted historian Thomas Carlyle to give him the nickname \"Super Grammaticam\" from the response that he had given (\"Ego sum rex Romanus et super grammaticam\").\n\nAn alliance with England against France, and a failed attempt, owing to the hostility of the princes, to secure peace in Germany by a league of the towns, were his main acts during these years. Also, Sigismund granted control of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (which he had received back after Jobst's death) to Frederick I of Hohenzollern, burgrave of Nuremberg (1415). This step made the Hohenzollern family one of the most important in Germany.\n\nSigismund began to shift his alliance from France to England after the French defeat at the Battle of Agincourt. The Treaty of Canterbury (August 15, 1416) culminated diplomatic efforts between Henry V of England and Sigismund and resulted in a defensive and offensive alliance against France. This, in turn, led the way to the resolution of the papal schism.\n\nIn 1419, the death of Wenceslaus IV left Sigismund titular King of Bohemia, but he had to wait for seventeen years before the Czech Estates would acknowledge him. Although the two dignities of King of the Romans and King of Bohemia added considerably to his importance, and indeed made him the nominal temporal head of Christendom, they conferred no increase of power and financially embarrassed him. It was only as King of Hungary that he had succeeded in establishing his authority and in doing anything for the order and good government of the land. Entrusting the government of Bohemia to Sofia of Bavaria, the widow of Wenceslaus, he hastened into Hungary.\n\nThe Bohemians, who distrusted him as the betrayer of Hus, were soon in arms; and the flame was fanned when Sigismund declared his intention of prosecuting the war against heretics. Three campaigns against the Hussites ended in disaster although the army of his most loyal ally Stibor of Stiboricz and later his son Stibor of Beckov could hold the Hussite side away from the borders of the Kingdom. The Turks were again attacking Hungary. The king, unable to obtain support from the German princes, was powerless in Bohemia. His attempts at the diet of Nuremberg in 1422 to raise a mercenary army were foiled by the resistance of the towns; and in 1424 the electors, among whom was Sigismund's former ally, Frederick I of Hohenzollern, sought to strengthen their own authority at the expense of the king. Although the scheme failed, the danger to Germany from the Hussites led to the Union of Bingen, which virtually deprived Sigismund of the leadership of the war and the headship of Germany.\n\nIn 1428, Sigismund led another campaign against the Turks, but again with few results. In 1431, he went to Milan where on 25 November he received the Iron Crown as King of Italy; after which he remained for some time at Siena, negotiating for his coronation as emperor and for the recognition of the Council of Basel by Pope Eugenius IV. He was crowned emperor in Rome on 31 May 1433, and after obtaining his demands from the Pope returned to Bohemia, where he was recognized as king in 1436, though his power was little more than nominal. Shortly after he was crowned, Pope Eugenius began attempts to create a new anti-Ottoman alliance. This was sparked by an Albanian revolt against the Ottomans, which had begun in 1432. In 1435, Sigismund sent Fruzhin, a Bulgarian nobleman, to negotiate an alliance with the Albanians. He also sent Daud, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, in early 1436. However, following the defeat of the rebels in 1436, plans for an anti-Ottoman alliance ended.\n\nSigismund died on 9 December 1437 at Znojmo (), Moravia (now Czech Republic), and as ordered in life, he was buried at Nagyvárad, Hungary (today Oradea, Romania), next to the tomb of the king Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary, who was the ideal of the perfect monarch, warrior and Christian for that time and was deeply venerated by Sigismund. By his second wife, Barbara of Celje, he left an only daughter, Elisabeth of Luxembourg, who was married to Albert V, duke of Austria (later German king as Albert II) whom Sigismund named as his successor. As he left no sons, his line of the House of Luxembourg became extinct on his death.\n\nSigismund married twice but had little luck in securing the succession to his crowns. Each of his two marriages resulted in the birth of one child. His first-born child, probably a son, was born prematurely as a result of a horse riding accident suffered by Queen Mary of Hungary when she was well advanced in pregnancy. Mother and child both died shortly after the birth in the hills of Buda on 17 May 1395. This caused a deep succession crisis because Sigismund ruled over Hungary by right of his wife, and although he managed to keep his power, the crisis lasted until his second marriage to Barbara of Celje. Barbara's only child, born in the purple on 7 October 1409, probably in the castle of Visegrád, was Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the future queen consort of Hungary, Germany, and Bohemia. Queen Barbara was unable to give birth to any further issue. Elisabeth of Bohemia was thus the only surviving legitimate offspring of Sigismund.\n\nSigismund was known to speak fluent Hungarian, wore Hungarian-style royal clothes, and even grew his beard in the Hungarian fashion. He also spent huge amounts of money during his reign to rebuild the Gothic castles of Buda and Visegrád in the Kingdom of Hungary, ordering the transportation of materials from Austria and Bohemia.\n\nHis many affairs with women led to the birth of several legends, as the one that existed decades later during the reign of the King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. According to this, John Hunyadi was Sigismund's illegitimate son. Sigismund gave a ring to the boy's mother when he was born, but one day in the forest a raven stole it from her, and the ring was only recovered after the bird was hunted down. It is said that this incident inspired the coat of arms of the Hunyadis, and later also appeared in the coat of arms of Matthias \"Corvinus\".\n\nSigismund adopted the Hungarian reverence for Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary, who was considered to be an ideal Christian knight at that time.

Before Sigismund died, he ordered to be buried next to the king saint.\n\nThe Reformatio Sigismundi appeared in connection with efforts to reform the Holy Roman Empire during the reign of Emperor Sigismund (1410–1437).

Her family had moved to Tunisia to escape persecution after their conversion.\n\nHer mother Fadhma Aït Mansour, who was a famous Kabyle singer, had a great impact on her life, and her literary style would reflect the oral traditions of the Kabylie Berber people of her mother's heritage. Amrouche received her elementary and secondary education in Tunis, and in 1935 went to France for studies at the École Normale at Sèvres. From 1936, in collaboration with her elder brother Jean Amrouche and her mother, Amrouche collected and began to interpret Kabyle songs. In 1939, at the Congrès de Chant de Fès, she received a scholarship to study at the Casa Velasquez in Spain, where she researched the ties between Berber and Spanish popular songs.\n\nHer autobiographical first novel, \"Jacinthe noir\", was published in 1947 and is one of the earliest ever published in French by a North African woman writer.

{"id": "1158881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1158881", "title": "Tituba", "text": "Tituba\n\nTituba was an enslaved woman, owned by Samuel Parris of Danvers, Massachusetts. Although her origins are debated, research has suggested that she was a South American native and sailed from Barbados to New England with Samuel Parris. Tituba was the first to be accused of practicing witchcraft during the 1692 Salem witch trials. Little is known regarding Tituba's life prior to her enslavement. However, she became a pivotal figure in the witch trials when she confessed to witchcraft while also making claims that both Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne participated in said witchcraft. She was imprisoned and later released by Samuel Conklin, but little to nothing is known about Tituba's life following her subsequent release.\n\nTituba's husband was John Indian, a Native American man whose origins are unknown, but he may have been from Central America. Tituba as well may have been originally from Central America before Barbados. There are arguments made that Tituba was African American but this has been contradicted by historians, including Elaine Breslaw, who partially blames Charles Upham, who got false information from Samuel Drake, for the confusion. Possibly she was born in Barbados but, regardless, she was a descendant of captives on the island. Her husband went on to become one of the accusers in the Witch Trials. They appear documented together in Samuel Parris's church record book.\n\nTituba was the first person to be accused by Elizabeth Parris and Abigail Williams of witchcraft. It has been theorized that Tituba told the girls tales of voodoo and witchcraft prior to the accusations. She was also the first to confess to witchcraft in Salem Village in March 1692. Initially denying her involvement in witchcraft, Tituba later confessed to making a \"witchcake\", due to being beaten by Samuel Parris with the intention of getting a confession. When questioned later, she added that she knew about occult techniques from her mistress in Barbados, who taught her how to ward herself from evil powers and how to reveal the cause of witchcraft. Since such knowledge was not meant for harm, Tituba again asserted to Parris she was not a witch, but admitted she had participated in an occult ritual when she made the witchcake in an attempt to help Elizabeth Parris. Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne were sent to jail in Boston to await trial and punishment on March 7, 1692 . Despite these confessions, there is no proof that she did the things to which she confessed.\n\nOther women and men from surrounding villages were accused of witchcraft and arrested at the Salem witchcraft trials. Not only did Tituba accuse others in her confession, but she talked about black dogs, hogs, a yellow bird, red and black rats, cats, a fox and a wolf. Tituba talked about riding sticks to different places. She confessed that Sarah Osborne possessed a creature with the head of a woman, two legs, and wings. Since it mixed various perspectives on witchcraft, Tituba's confession confused listeners, and its similarities to certain stock tropes of demonology caused some Salem Village residents to believe that Satan was among them.\n\nThe majority of fictional pieces that artistically or historically depict Tituba's life portray her as an \"other\" or an \"outgroup\" by Puritan society, due to her racial and socioeconomic status as a South American Native Indigenous and an indentured servant woman. Although it is not explicitly discussed in all of the movies, plays and books, that account for Tituba's conviction, it is quite possible that the \"fear of strangers\" in combination with the Western European traditional belief and understanding of witchcraft, made Tituba a prime target for witchcraft conviction. With reference to the historical understanding of Tituba and why she was convicted, it has been argued that the pre-existing ideas about \"out groups\" and stereotypical ideas of foreign cultures combined with fictional portrayals of witchcraft and sorcery works, has created a case where history and fiction shape each other. Essentially, the fictional works have assisted in the idea of what the Salem Witch Trials were like and what events lead to the convictions, trials and confessions, but without factoring in racial, political, religious and economic influences of the time, the portrayals of Tituba in media remain, for the most part, fictional.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, in his 1868 play entitled \"Giles Corey of the Salem Farms\", describes Tituba as \"the daughter of a man all black and fierce…He was an Obi man, and taught [her] magic.\" Obeah (also spelled Obi) is a specifically African and Afro-American system of magic.\"\n\nShe featured prominently in the 1953 play \"The Crucible\" by Arthur Miller as well as the 1957 and 1996 film adaptations of the play. Tituba is played by American born actress, Charlayne Woodard, in the 1996 film. The image of Tituba as the instigator of witchcraft at Salem was reinforced by the opening scene of \"The Crucible\", which owes much to Marion L. Starkey's work \"The Devil in Massachusetts\" (1949).\n\nIn the play, Tituba was brought to Salem from Barbados, was taught how to conjure up spirits, and had allegedly dabbled in sorcery, witchcraft, and Satanism. These fictional accounts hold that Abigail Williams and the other girls tried to use her knowledge when dancing in the woods before the trials began; it was, in fact, their being caught that led to those events. With the original intention of covering up their own sinful deeds, Tituba was the one to be accused by Abigail, who had in fact drunk from a magic cup Tituba made to kill John Proctor's wife, Elizabeth, and to bewitch him into loving her. She and the other girls claimed to have seen Tituba \"with the Devil\". It is ironic that the belief that Tituba led these girls astray has persisted in popular lore, fiction and non fiction alike. The charge, which is seen by some as having barely disguised racist undertones, is based on the imagination of authors like Starkey, who mirrors Salem's accusers when she asserts that \"I have invented the scenes with Tituba ... but they are what I really believe happened.\"\n\nTituba is also the main character in the 1956 book \"Tituba of Salem Village\" by Ann Petry. Written for children 10 and up, it portrays Tituba as a black West Indian woman who tells stories about life in Barbados to the village girls. These stories are mingled with existing superstitions and half-remembered pagan beliefs on the part of Puritans (for instance, it is a white neighbor who makes the witch cake, rather than Tituba herself), and the witchcraft hysteria is partly attributed to a sort of cabin fever during a particularly bitter winter.\n\nTituba is the subject of the award-winning novel \"\" (1986) by Maryse Condé, a novel version of Tituba's life which creates a biography for her, beginning and ending in Barbados, and including supernatural elements.\n\nTituba appears in the novel \"Calligraphy of the Witch\" (2007) by Alicia Gaspar de Alba as an Arawak Native American Indigenous from Guyana fluent in several languages, and the only person in the Boston area who understands Spanish. She is a friend and English tutor to the indentured servant Concepción Benavidez who is accused of witchcraft in the Boston area because of her Mexican and Catholic culture.\n\nShe is also featured as a main character on WGN's television series \"Salem\" (2013). The show portrays her as being a powerful witch, along with other historical figures from the Salem Witch Trials who also are portrayed as having supernatural powers.\n\nIn \"\" (2013-2014), young African-American witch Queenie states that she is a descendant of Tituba. Later in the series, Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau and Supreme witch Fiona Goode have an in-depth discussion of Tituba's history and legacy. They suggest her magic came from her Arawak ancestry.\n\n\n\n"}

Peters (born November 7, 1942) is an American writer on business management practices, best known for \"In Search of Excellence\" (co-authored with Robert H. Waterman Jr).\n\nPeters was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He went to Severn School a private, preparatory high school, graduating in 1960. Peters then attended Cornell University, receiving a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1964, and a master's degree in 1966.\n\nHe returned to academia in 1970 to study business at Stanford Business School receiving an MBA followed by a PhD in Organizational Behavior in 1977. The title of his dissertation was \"Patterns of Winning and Losing: Effects on Approach and Avoidance by Friends and Enemies.\" Karl Weick credited Peters' dissertation with giving him the idea for his 1984 article: \"Small wins: Redefining the scale of social problems.\" \nWhile at Stanford, Peters was influenced by Jim G. March, Herbert Simon (both at Stanford), and Karl Weick (at the University of Michigan). Later, he noted that he was influenced by Douglas McGregor and Einar Thorsrud.\n\nIn 2004, he also received an honorary doctorate from the State University of Management in Moscow.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, he served in the United States Navy, making two deployments to Vietnam as a Navy Seabee, then later working in the Pentagon. From 1973 to 1974, he worked in the White House as a senior drug-abuse advisor, during the Nixon administration. Peters has acknowledged the influence of military strategist Colonel John Boyd on his later writing.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1981, Peters worked as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, becoming a partner and Organization Effectiveness practice leader in 1979. In 1981, he left McKinsey to become an independent consultant.\n\nIn 1990, Peters was referred to in a British Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) publication as one of the world's \"Quality Gurus\".\n\nIn 1995, the \"New York Times\" referred to Peters as one of the top three business gurus in the highest demand as a speaker along with Daniel Burrus and Roger Blackwell.\n\nIn 2017, the Thinkers50 awarded Peters with its Lifetime Achievement Award for his paving the way for the 'thought leadership' and 'business book industries'. \nThe publication of the popular business book \"In Search of Excellence\" in 1982 marked a turning point in Peters' career.\n\nPeters states that directly after graduating with a PhD from Stanford in 1977, and returning to McKinsey, the new managing director, Ron Daniel, handed him a \"fascinating assignment.\" Motivated by the new ideas coming from Bruce Henderson's Boston Consulting Group, Daniel noted that businesses often failed to effectively implement new strategies, so Peters \"was asked to look at 'organization effectiveness' and 'implementation issues' in an inconsequential offshoot project nested in McKinsey's rather offbeat San Francisco office.\"\n\n\"In Search of Excellence\" was published in 1982. It became a bestseller, gaining exposure in the United States at a national level when a series of television specials based on the book and hosted by Peters appeared on PBS. The primary ideas espoused solving business problems with as little business-process overhead as possible, and empowering decision-makers at multiple levels of a company.\n\nThe December 2001 issue of \"Fast Company\" quoted Peters admitting that he and Waterman had falsified the underlying data for \"In Search of Excellence\". He is quoted as saying, \" This is pretty small beer, but for what it's worth, okay, I confess: We faked the data. A lot of people suggested it at the time.\" He later insisted that this was untrue and that he was the victim of an \"aggressive headline.\"\n\nIn 1987 Peters published \"Thriving on Chaos: Handbook for a Management Revolution\".\n\nIn later books Peters has encouraged personal responsibility in response to the \"New Economy\".\n\nA more recent book is \"The Little Big Things\", released in March 2010.\n\nPeters currently lives in West Tinmouth, Vermont with his wife Susan Sargent, and continues to write and speak about personal and business empowerment and problem-solving methodologies.\nHis namesake company \"Tom Peters Company\" is based in Essex in the UK.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "400719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=400719", "title": "Virgil Earp", "text": "Virgil Earp\n\nVirgil Walter Earp (July 18, 1843 – October 19, 1905) was both deputy U.S. Marshal and Tombstone, Arizona City Marshal when he led his brothers Morgan and Wyatt and Doc Holliday in a confrontation with outlaw Cowboys at the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881. They killed brothers Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys who were upset by the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. All four lawmen were charged with murder by Ike Clanton, who had run from the gunfight. During a month-long preliminary hearing, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated the men, concluding they had been performing their duty.\n\nBut two months later on December 28, friends of the slain outlaws retaliated, ambushing Virgil. They shot him in the back, hitting him with three shotgun rounds, shattering his left arm and leaving him permanently maimed. The Cowboys suspected were let off for lack of evidence. His brother Morgan Earp was assassinated in March 1882. Charges against those suspected were dismissed on a technicality. Wyatt Earp, appointed as deputy U.S. sheriff to replace Virgil, concluded he could not rely on civil justice and decided to take matters into his own hands. Wyatt assembled a federal posse that included their brother Warren Earp and set out on a vendetta to kill those they felt were responsible. Virgil left Tombstone to recuperate from his wounds in Colton, California where his parents lived.\n\nVirgil married before he left to serve in the Union Army during the American Civil War. When he returned, his wife and child had left. He held a variety of other jobs throughout his life, though he primarily worked in law enforcement. His younger brother Wyatt, who spent most of his life as a gambler, became better known as a lawman because of writer Stuart N. Lake's fictionalized 1931 biography \"\" and later portrayals of him in movies and fiction as Old West's \"toughest and deadliest gunmen of his day.\" In 1898, Virgil learned that his first wife Ellen Rysdam and their daughter were living in Oregon and reestablished contact with them. After suffering from pneumonia for six months, Virgil died on October 19, 1905.\n\nVirgil Earp was born in Hartford, Kentucky, the second son of Nicholas Earp and Virginia Ann Cooksey.\n\nIn February 1860, while living in Pella, Iowa, 16-year-old Virgil eloped with 17-year-old Dutch immigrant Magdalena C. \"Ellen\" Rysdam (October 25, 1842 in Utrecht, Netherlands – May 3, 1910 in Cornelius, Oregon). One report states that they saw each other only occasionally and kept their marriage secret until Ellen was about to deliver their first child. When her parents Gerrit Rysdam and Magdalena Catrina Van Velzen learned of the marriage, they were furious, as they preferred that she marry a man who was also Dutch. Virgil's father thought he was too young to marry. Both parents wanted to get the marriage annulled. One source reports that Rysdam was successful, but another says her father failed because Virgil and Ellen refused to reveal where they had been married. They also claimed they had used false names, which would have made the marriage invalid in any case.\n\nVirgil and Ellen remained together for a year in spite of his and her parents' disapproval. On July 26, 1861, Virgil enlisted at age 18 in the Union Army. Ellen had a daughter named Nellie Jane, born January 7, 1862 or in July 1862. Virgil was mustered in to the Illinois Volunteer Infantry for three years on September 21, 1862.\n\nVirgil was assigned to the 83rd Illinois Infantry on August 21, 1863. The 83rd was primarily on garrison duty in Tennessee. Virgil was court martialed for a minor offense and docked two weeks pay as punishment.\n\nIn the summer of 1863 while Virgil was on active duty, Ellen's father told her that Virgil had been killed in Tennessee. In early 1864, Ellen married a Dutch man named John Van Rossum, and in May of that year they joined a large group who relocated from Pella, Iowa, to the Oregon Territory.\n\nWhen Virgil was discharged from the military on June 26, 1865, he returned to Iowa but could not find his wife and daughter. He hired on at a local farm and helped operate a grocery store, before leaving for California to join the rest of the Earp family. In 1868, Nicholas Earp took the family east again, eventually settling in Lamar, Missouri. On August 28, 1870, Virgil married Rosella Dragoo (born in France in 1853) in Lamar. His father as justice of the peace married them, but there are no further records of Rosella.\n\nVirgil later met Alvira \"Allie\" Sullivan from Florence, Nebraska in 1874. She was a waitress at the Planter's House Hotel in Council Bluffs, Iowa. They never married but remained together the rest of his life. During the remainder of his life, Virgil worked at a variety of jobs, including peace officer, farmer, rail construction in Wyoming, stagecoach driver, sawmill sawyer in Prescott, Arizona Territory, mailman, and later in life, prospector. The Earp brothers were close and often moved together, seeking a better life. Virgil spent time in Dodge City, Kansas in 1877 with his younger brother Wyatt, and though there is no record of Virgil ever holding any law enforcement position there, Allie claimed he briefly worked as a deputy town marshal with Wyatt.\n\nFrom Dodge City, Virgil and Allie moved to Prescott in July 1877, the capital of the Arizona Territory. Virgil first delivered mail in Miller Valley, then later owned a saw mill at the base of Thumb Butte, just west of Prescott.\n\nIn October 1877, U.S. Marshal Wiley Standifer, Yavapai County Sheriff Edward Franklin Bowers, Prescott Constable Frank Murray, Virgil Earp, and a man named McCall attempted to arrest John Tallos and an accused murderer named Wilson. While the others road on horseback or carriages, Virgil ran on foot after the posse that pursued the two men to the edge of town, where a gun fight broke out. Virgil spotted one of the two men under a tree, reloading his pistol. Using a Henry rifle from a distance, Virgil shot him through the head, killing him.\n\nVirgil was shortly afterward offered a job as a driver for Patterson, Caldwell & Levally, a local freight company, during which he met John J. Gosper, Secretary of the Arizona Territory, and usually acting in the place of Governor John C. Frémont, who was usually absent. When Crawley Dake was appointed U.S. Marshal, he and Virgil became friends. In 1878, Virgil was appointed as Prescott's night watchman, which paid $75 a month. In November 1878, he was elected as constable for Prescott, for which he received fees for issuing licenses, collecting fees, and serving summonses. While constable, Virgil wrote his brother Wyatt about the opportunities in the silver-mining boomtown of Tombstone. In September 1879, Wyatt resigned as assistant marshal in Dodge City. Accompanied by his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, his brother Jim and his wife Bessie, \"Doc Holliday\" and Big Nose Kate, they left for Arizona Territory.\n\nKnowing Virgil was moving to Tombstone, and knowing of his peace officer background, U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake appointed Virgil as deputy U.S. marshal for the Tombstone District of Pima County, on November 27, 1879. He was instructed by Dake to help resolve ongoing problems with outlaw Cowboys. But the job didn't pay much. He was mostly on call helping county and city officials.\n\nIn an interview after he left Tombstone, Virgil said that \"The first stage that went out of Prescott toward Tombstone was robbed. Robberies were frequent and became expensive.\" Virgil and his brothers Wyatt and Jim and their wives arrived together in Tombstone on December 1, 1879.\n\nOn October 30, 1880, after town marshal Fred White was accidentally shot and killed by outlaw and gunman \"Curly Bill\" Brocius, Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone. Virgil now held both the more powerful local town marshal position and the prestigious federal law enforcement appointment. As town marshal, Virgil earned a regular salary of $100 a month plus a percentage of city taxes he collected.\n\nBut Virgil did not hold the job for long. The city held a special election on November 13, and Tombstone city policemen James Flynn and Ben Sippy competed for the job. But then Flynn dropped out of the race and Sippy beat Virgil for the office, 311 votes to Earp's 259. On January 4, 1881, the city held its first regular election, and Virgil lost to Sippy once again.\n\nHowever, Sippy was known to be in financial trouble. He requested a two-week leave of absence on June 6, 1881, and never returned. The city council once again appointed Virgil as temporary city marshal. On June 22, the center section of Tombstone was devastated by a fire. Virgil kept looting under control and chased off lot jumpers who tried to take over property. On June 28, it was learned that Sippy had left about $3,000 in bad debt and financial improprieties in his office. Virgil was appointed by Tombstone Mayor John Clum as the permanent city marshal and paid $150.00 per month.\n\nTo reduce crime in Tombstone, the City Council enacted an ordinance in April 1881 that prohibited anyone from carrying a deadly weapon in town. Everyone was required to deposit their weapons at a livery or saloon soon after entering town. A long-simmering feud between the Earps and some of the Cowboys played a big role in a gunfight that broke out when Virgil decided to enforce the ordinance on Wednesday, October 26, 1881.\n\nVirgil was told by several concerned citizens that several Cowboys, who had been threatening the Earps for several months, were in town and armed in violation of the ordinance. Assisted by his deputy Morgan Earp and temporary deputies Wyatt Earp and John \"Doc\" Holliday, Virgil went to disarm Frank and Tom McLaury, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Billy Claiborne. That confrontation turned into a shootout now known as the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.\n\nThe gunfight and later media portrayals made Wyatt Earp a legend. He is often depicted as the central lawman, but he was only Virgil's temporary assistant. Wyatt had acted as city marshal the week prior when Virgil was out of town. Virgil was the city marshal and deputy U.S. marshal. Although Wyatt had previously served in Wichita, Kansas, and Dodge City as a lawman, Virgil had three years of Civil War service, which had given him more combat and shooting experience. He had also served as a lawman off and on since the war.\n\nBefore the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt had been in only one shootout and Morgan had never been in any gun battles. Billy Claiborne had been in one gunfight prior to the shootout and was the only member of the Cowboy faction that had prior gunfighting experience (not counting the Skeleton Canyon massacre, in which the McLaurys and Clantons took part). Doc Holliday, despite his reputation, had no documented gunfights to his credit, other than a couple of drunken brawls, and only his own tales of fights with unnamed men he claimed to have shot. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from having been pistol-whipped by the Earps earlier that morning, and at least Ike was still drunk.\n\nVirgil initially avoided a confrontation with Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton, who had arrived in town early that afternoon and had not yet deposited their weapons at a hotel or stable soon after their arrival, as required by ordinance #9. But around 1:00 p.m., a miner named Ruben F. Coleman told Virgil that the Cowboys had left the Dunbar and Dexter Stable for the O.K. Corral and were still armed, and Virgil decided he had to disarm them.\n\nVirgil testified after the shootout that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges at Spangenberg's gun shop beforehand. He went by the Wells Fargo office around the corner on Allen Street and picked up a 10- or 12-gauge short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.\n\nVirgil, his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, and Doc Holliday confronted the Cowboys in a narrow lot on Fremont Street. Virgil was not expecting a fight. He later testified that when he saw the Cowboys, he immediately commanded them to \"Throw up your hands, I want your guns!\" But general shooting broke out almost immediately. Witnesses were conflicted about who fired first. During the gunfight, Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Virgil was shot through the calf (he thought by Billy Clanton). Three days after the O.K. Corral gunfight, the city council suspended Virgil as city marshal pending outcome of the preliminary hearing. Virgil was eventually exonerated of wrongdoing, but his reputation suffered thereafter.\n\nAfter the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral the Earps relocated their families to the Cosmopolitan Hotel for mutual support and protection. At about 11:30 pm on December 28, 1881, Virgil was ambushed as he walked from the Oriental Saloon to his room. The \"Sacramento Daily Record-Union\" reported that \"he was fired upon with double-barreled shotguns, loaded with buckshot, by three men concealed in an unfinished building diagonally across on Allen street.\"\n\nVirgil was hit in the back and left arm by three loads of buckshot from about . The Crystal Palace Saloon and the Eagle Brewery beyond Virgil were struck by nineteen buckshot; three passed through the window and one about a foot over the heads of some men standing by a faro-table. George Parsons wrote that he heard \"four shots in quick succession.\" Critically wounded, Virgil staggered into the hotel. \"One short struck him above the groin, coming out near the spine.\" The humerus bone in his upper arm was longitudinally fractured.\n\nDr. George E. Goodfellow removed of shattered humerus bone from Virgil's left arm, leaving his arm permanently crippled, and twenty buckshot from his side. While the doctor worked on his arm, Virgil told his wife Allie, \"Never mind, I've got one arm left to hug you with.\" Virgil was also shot through the back above the hip, which penetrated his body and lodged near the hip bone above the groin. The \"Los Angeles Daily Herald\" reported that the \"cow-boys are bent on vengeance for the slaughter of their companeros a few weeks ago.\" \"The doctor says there are four chances in five that he will die.\"\n\nGeorge W. Parsons, who had been treated by Goodfellow for an injury he received, was staying in Goodfellow's office while he recuperated. He kept a journal, in which he recorded:\n\nWyatt, assuming that Virgil was dying, telegraphed U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake asking him to name Wyatt as Virgil's replacement as deputy U.S. marshal:\n\nCommenting on the telegram received by Dake, the \"Weekly Arizona Miner\" wrote about the repeated threats received by the Earps and others. \"For some time, the Earps, Doc Holliday, Tom Fitch and others who upheld and defended the Earps in their late trial have received, almost daily, anonymous letters, warning them to leave town or suffer death, supposed to have been written by friends of the Clanton and McLowry boys, three of whom the Earps and Holliday killed and little attention was paid to them as they were believed to be idle boasts but the shooting of Virgil Earp last night shows that the men were in earnest.\" The \"Los Angeles Herald\" reported on December 30 that \"the \"local authorities are doing nothing to capture the assassins so far as is known... Judge Spicer, Marshal Williams, Wyatt Earp, Rickabaugh and other are in momentary danger of assassination.\"\n\nThe suspected shooters were later identified as Phin Clanton, Ike Clanton, Johnny Barnes, Johnny Ringo, Hank Swilling and Pete Spence. On Tuesday, January 31, 1882 Ike and Phin were brought before Judge William H. Stilwell on suspicion of shooting Virgil. The district attorney asked that bail be set at $5,000, but the judge released both men on $1,500 bond, indicating he thought the prosecution's case was weak.\n\nAlthough a hat that Wyatt later claimed belonged to Ike Clanton was found near the shooting, the evidence was circumstantial. Sherman McMaster provided the most convincing evidence. He testified that he saw Ike later that night in nearby Charleston. He said he asked Clanton \"about the shooting, at which Clanton replied that he 'would have to go back and do the job over.'\" On February 2, Clanton's attorney brought in seven witnesses who provided an alibi for Clanton. They all testified that Clanton had been in Charleston at the time of Virgil's shooting. Spicer was compelled to release Clanton.\n\nAfter his shooting, Virgil spent the next three months recuperating. He was just starting to get back on his feet when on Saturday, March 18, 1882, Virgil's younger brother Morgan Earp was killed in another ambush.\n\nOn Monday, March 20, Virgil and Allie were escorted by Wyatt and deputies Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, Sherman McMaster, and \"Turkey Creek\" Jack Johnson to Contention, where they drove two wagons to the Arizona and New Mexico Railroad terminal away in Benson. Wyatt and his deputies had initially planned to travel only as far as Benson. Wyatt reported later that he received word in Contention that Ike Clanton, Frank Stilwell, Hank Swilling, and another cowboy were watching the passenger trains in Tucson with the aim to kill Virgil. Wyatt and the rest of the posse remained with Virgil and Allie through to Tucson.\n\nThe men were well armed with pistols, rifles and shotguns. McMaster wore two cartridge belts. Allie wore Virgil's pistol belt during the journey so it would be handy. Virgil told the \"San Francisco Examiner\" two months later that upon getting off the train in Tucson, \"Almost the first men we met on the platform there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth.\" \"They fell back into the crowd as soon as they saw I had an escort, and the boys took me to the hotel to supper.\" Guarded by his brothers and the deputies, Virgil and Allie had dinner at Porter's Hotel in Tucson. Virgil was so weak he had to be carried up the steps of the train. Once they were safely seated, the rest of the guards kept watch for the Cowboys.\n\nAs Virgil's train was pulling out of Tucson on its way to California, gunfire was heard. Witnesses gave contradictory accounts about the number of men seen near the tracks and numbers of shots fired. Some said the Earps were armed after leaving Porter's Hotel and others said they were not. Witnesses saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone in the dark. Wyatt said later that he and his deputies spotted Frank Stilwell and another man he believed to be Ike Clanton armed with shotguns lying on a flatcar. Virgil and Allie along with James accompanied Morgan's body to the Earp family home in Colton, California.\n\nWhen Wyatt and his men approached, the two men ran. Stilwell may have stumbled or been wounded, allowing Wyatt to reach him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as Stilwell attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Wyatt, quoted in the \"Denver Republican\", said \"I ran straight for Stilwell. It was he who killed my brother. What a coward he was! He couldn't shoot when I came near him. He stood there helpless and trembling for his life. As I rushed upon him he put out his hands and clutched at my shotgun. I let go both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet.\"\n\nHe said Stilwell cried \"Morg!\" before he was killed. Stilwell's body, riddled with buckshot from two shotgun rounds, one in his leg and the second in his chest with powder burns, and four other bullet wounds, was found the next morning near the tracks. Ike Clanton got away. When the Tucson sheriff learned who was responsible for Stilwell's death, he issued warrants for the lawmen's arrest.\n\nClanton gave an interview afterward to the newspapers in which he claimed that he and Stilwell had been in Tucson to respond to federal charges about interfering with a U.S. mail carrier, stemming from his alleged involvement in robbing the Sandy Bob line of the Bisbee stage on September 8, 1881. Clanton said that they had heard that the Earps were coming via the train and they had plans to kill Stilwell. According to Clanton, Stilwell disappeared from the hotel before he was found several blocks away, shot dead by the tracks.\n\nAfter receiving his injuries in Tombstone, Virgil spent the next two years recovering from his injuries, primarily at his parents' home in Colton, California. He sought treatment for his wounds in San Francisco and was interviewed on the Southern Pacific train by a reporter whose story was printed in the \"San Francisco Examiner\" on May 27, 1882. The reporter described Virgil's appearance:\n\nDespite the use of only one arm, Virgil was hired by the Southern Pacific Railroad to guard its tracks in Colton's famous \"battle of the crossing\". Virgil joined in the frog war as the Southern Pacific attempted to stop the California Southern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, from installing a crossing over the Southern Pacific tracks in Colton to gain access to California. Governor Waterman deputized a posse from San Bernardino, California and came down in person to enforce construction of the crossing, ending the Southern Pacific's railroad monopoly in Southern California.\n\nIn 1884 Virgil's father, Nicholas Porter Earp was elected justice of the peace. Two years later, Virgil Earp opened a private detective agency, which by all accounts was abandoned in 1886, when he was elected village constable in July.\n\nWhen Colton was incorporated as a city, Virgil was elected as Colton's first City Marshal on July 11, 1887. He was paid $75 a month and was re-elected to another term in 1888. Among other duties, he was reported to have cleared blocked sewers and kept track of the electric light bulbs. Virgil and Allie's Colton home still stands at 528 West \"H\" Street.\n\nIn 1888 Virgil resigned as city marshal and he and Allie left Colton for San Bernardino. Five years later, in 1893, he and his wife moved to the short-lived mining town Vanderbilt, California. He owned and operated the only two story building in town, Earp's Hall, a saloon and meeting hall used for public gatherings and even the town's church services. His business success in Vanderbilt did not match his success in politics, and he lost the election for town constable in 1894.\n\nIn 1895, Virgil and Allie traveled to Cripple Creek, Colorado, where they met Virgil's brother Wyatt. They stayed briefly and soon moved back to Prescott in Yavapai County, Arizona, where Virgil became involved in mining. Virgil started mining in the Hassayampa district in partnership with W.H. Harlon. They leased the Grizzly mine owned by W.C. Hanson. The Prescott \"Weekly Journal Miner\" reported on November 8, 1896 that the day before \"a serious accident had occurred at this mine. Virgil Earp and W. H. Harlon were working in a tunnel. The ground caved catching Mr. Earp and pinning him to the ground. He was unconscious for several hours and Dr. Abbott, was called to dress his wounds.\" The doctor told Earp he had dislocated his right hip. Both his feet and ankles were badly crushed, he had a serious cut on his head and bruises all over his body. The doctor said it would be several weeks before Virgil would be able to move around again, but it took him much longer to recover.\nThey moved south after that and began ranching in the Kirkland Valley. Virgil was nominated as a candidate for Yavapai County, Arizona sheriff in 1900, but pulled out of the election for health reasons.\n\nIn 1898 Virgil received a startling letter from a Mrs. Levi Law. After returning from the Civil War as a young man, his wife Ellen was told by her family that Virgil had been killed. Her family took her and their daughter Nellie to Walla Walla, Washington, where she married Thomas Eaton and had four more children. Mrs. Levi Law was Virgil's daughter, Nellie. The next year, encouraged by his wife, Virgil traveled to Portland, Oregon, where he was reunited with Ellen and Nellie Jane Law. On April 22, 1898, The Oregonian reported that Virgil \"...is now enjoying a very pleasant visit with her and his two grandchildren at her home, which is near that of Mrs. Eaton, in North Portland.\" He also met three grandchildren he never knew existed. Later that year, according to her letter to The Oregonian, Nellie Jane visited Virgil and Allie Earp at their home in Arizona.\n\nBefore 1904, Virgil and Allie returned to Colton, where city records show that he along with three others unsuccessfully petitioned the city leaders to repeal a temperance law that only allowed one saloon in town. In 1904, they left California for the last time and joined Wyatt in the boom town of Goldfield, Nevada, where Virgil became a deputy sheriff for Esmeralda County, Nevada. But Virgil caught pneumonia during a local epidemic and couldn't shake it for six months. He had broken bones from a mine cave-in some years previously and his health was weakened.\n\nIn her memoirs, Allie wrote that Virgil's last words were, \"Light my cigar, and stay here and hold my hand.\" He died on October 19, 1905, leaving his brother Wyatt as the last surviving participant of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Virgil was also survived by his father Nicholas, brothers James and Newton, wife Allie, and daughter Nellie.\n\nAt the request of his daughter, Nellie Jane Bohn, Allie sent his remains to Portland, Oregon, and he was buried in the River View Cemetery there.\n\nVirgil Earp has been portrayed by several actors.\n\n\nThe character of Virgil Earp also appears in the alternate history novel \"How Few Remain\" as part of the Southern Victory Series by Harry Turtledove, where he serves as a colonel during the Second Mexican War.\n\n\n"}

She is the younger daughter of cinematographer and director Caleb Deschanel and actress Mary Jo Deschanel (née Weir). Her paternal grandfather was French, from Oullins, Rhône; she also has Swiss, Dutch, English, Irish, and other French ancestry. She was named after Zooey Glass, the male protagonist of J. D. Salinger's 1961 novella \"Franny and Zooey\". Her older sister is actress Emily Deschanel, who starred in the Fox crime comedy-drama series \"Bones\".\n\nDeschanel lived in Los Angeles, but spent much of her childhood traveling because her father shot films on location; she later said that she \"hated all the traveling ... I'm really happy now that I had the experience, but at the time I was just so miserable to have to leave my friends in Los Angeles and go to places where they didn't have any food I liked or things I was used to.\" She attended Crossroads, a private preparatory school in Santa Monica, where she befriended future co-stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Kate Hudson. She sang throughout high school, planning to pursue a career in musical theatre and attending French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts.

In the comedy \"Big Trouble\", with Tim Allen and Rene Russo, she played the daughter of a devoted and reluctant woman, and in the teen comedy \"The New Guy\", starred as a guitar player in a band. Deschanel portrayed a cynical, plain-spoken young woman working in a big-box store in the black dramedy \"The Good Girl\", opposite Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal. The psychological thriller \"Abandon\" saw her play the roommate of a woman involved in her boyfriend's disappearance. Deschanel also made a one-episode appearance in \"Frasier\", as an out-of-control young woman. \"The New York Times\" reported that Deschanel was \"one of Hollywood's most sought-after young stars\", in 2002, and the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in early 2003 that Deschanel had become a recognizable type, due to \"her deadpan, sardonic and scene-stealing [film] performances\" as the protagonist's best friend. Deschanel objected to her typecasting, arguing, \"A lot of these roles are just a formula idea of somebody's best friend, and it's like, I don't even have that many friends. In high school, I stayed home all the time, so I don't know how I'm everybody's best friend now.\"\n\nDeschanel obtained her first leading film role debut in the independent drama \"All the Real Girls\" (2003) as Noel, a sexually curious 18-year-old virgin who has a life-changing romance with an aimless 22-year-old. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was an arthouse success. Her performance received wide critical acclaim, and \"Variety\" remarked: \"Performances are all credible and naturalistic, but standing out from the rest is Deschanel's work, which evinces an impressively direct connection to her character's emotions. The actress does a wonderful job presenting a young woman who is trying, with varying degrees of success, to give voice to all sorts of things she has never felt or expressed before\". She received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress. Also in 2003, Deschanel starred opposite Will Ferrell in the Christmas comedy \"Elf\" as a deadpan department store worker and the love interest of a man raised by Santa's elves.

The film was scheduled to begin shooting in 2006, but was then postponed indefinitely; it was then resurrected again, with a planned release date of 2012, before being cancelled altogether in 2011. Deschanel expressed frustration with the cancellation, saying she had spent three years working on imitating Joplin's scratchy singing voice.\n\nIn 2007, Deschanel appeared in two children's films: \"Bridge to Terabithia\", in which she played a quirky music teacher, and the animated film \"Surf's Up\", voicing a penguin.

She played Belladonna in the stoner fantasy-comedy \"Your Highness\" (2011), with Danny McBride and James Franco. The film received negative reviews and bombed at the box office. Describing her role, Roger Ebert noted in its review for the film: \"[Deschanel is] brought onstage, quickly kidnapped by an evil sorcerer, spends a good deal of time as a captive in his lair, is rescued and lives happily ever after. She might as well be a mannequin, for all she's given to say and do. This intelligent, nuanced actress, standing there baffled. Used as a placeholder\".\n\nDeschanel signed on to star as a bubbly and offbeat teacher Jessica \"Jess\" Day on the Fox sitcom \"New Girl\", created by Elizabeth Meriwether. She became a producer on the show and helped build the character, which she has described as a part of her, especially in regards to \"the sort of enthusiasm and optimism\" of her youth.
