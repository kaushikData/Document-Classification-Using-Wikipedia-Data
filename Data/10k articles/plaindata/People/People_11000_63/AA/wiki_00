On 4 August 2006 he was appointed again as head of the Ministry of Defence in the government of Viktor Yanukovych on the quota of President Yushchenko.\n\nIn the early 2007 parliamentary elections he was elected into the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) as number 4 on the party list of the pro-president Yushchenko Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc. Although this bloc was part of the Second Tymoshenko Government Yuriy Yekhanurov became Minister of Defense in this cabinet.\n\nIn January 2010 Hrytsenko became party leader of \"Civil Position\".\n\nHrytsenko was a candidate for President of Ukraine in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential elections, during the election he received 1,2% of the votes (finishing ninth).

Hrytsenko did not sign the November 2012 oppositional forces Batkivshchyna, UDAR and Svoboda joint action plan \"I did not sign this document because I offered another action plan, but it was not supported”; but did state he would fulfil it. On 18 May 2013 the faction of Batkivshchyna demanded that Hrytsenko (who was a member of the Batkivshchyna faction) would resign from parliament. Hrytsenko agreed to do that if Batkivshchyna faction leader Arseniy Yatseniuk would do the same. Hrytsenko eventually left the faction on 14 January 2014 \"Due to [my] inability to influence the decisions that are taken by the Batkivschyna faction\". Yatseniuk immediately responded by saying the faction hoped that after leaving the faction Hrytsenko would resign from parliament (also); and also added \"People blinded by their own ambitions do much harm to the team's struggle\". On 17 January 2014 Hrytsenko submitted a letter of resignation to parliament.\n\nHrytsenko was one of the candidates for presidency in the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election.

In the election he received 5.48% of the vote, ranking him in 4th place.\n\nIn October 2006, after the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine criticized the Ministry of Defense for the ineffective fight against corruption and crime in the army, Hrytsenko summoned Prosecutor General Oleksandr Medvedko to a live TV debates. Two Ukrainian TV channels offered their broadcasts for those debates. The head of the press service of the General Prosecutor's Office said that the Prosecutor General's Office is not a political structure to participate in the TV debates, and the Ministry of Defense is an institution under the control of the Prosecutor General's Office. It was decided to hold a joint board of the Prosecutor General's Office and the Ministry of Defense, at which journalists will be able to attend. After that Hrytsenko urged the Prosecutor General to resign.\n\nIn May 2014 the General Prosecutor Office of Ukraine stated that Anatoliy Hrytsenko’s actions (as one of ex-Ministers of Defense) have brought the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the state of inappropriate combat readiness. The criminal proceedings have been opened. People’s deputy, leader of the Svoboda political party, Oleh Tyahnybok, revealed some details of this criminal case: during the time when Hrytsenko was in charge of the Ministry of Defense, \"1,000 units of Strela, Strela-2, Strela-M, and Igla MPADS, which were based in Shostka, disappeared. The Prosecutor General's Office opened a criminal case and investigates these issues.\" Tyahnybok also added that under Hrytsenko, the Buk-M1 and S-300 complexes disappeared in an unknown direction.\n\nIn 2016, the General Prosecutor Office of Ukraine published materials of investigation “Russian war aggression against Ukraine”. According to published data, when Anatoliy Hrytsenko served as minister of defense war equipment had been sold out amounted to the sum of UAH 1,316.17 million.\n\nThe investigation states that this has been one of the main factors which led to the Crimea Crisis and War in Donbass.\n\nSeveral journalist investigations state that Anatoliy Hrytsenko was involved in corruption schemes of selling of military encampments and other military objects as well as discarding military property. The investigation of the 1NEWS agency shows that during the period when Anatoliy Hrytsenko was a Minister, the Ministry of Defense lost 27 military towns. In addition, journalists learned that the peak of arms exports from Ukraine to other countries fell for 2006. Ukraine sold 634 missiles and rocket launchers, 83 armored vehicles, as well as 38 tanks.

According to these documents, in 2005-2007 Hrytsenko sold 24 hectares of land on the Stolychne highway owned by the Ministry of Defense to ex-mayor of Kyiv Leonid Chernovetsky. According to journalists, Chernovetsky took an active part in this criminal transaction.\n\n\nHrytsenko is married to Yulia Volodymyrivna Mostova, a chief editor of well known Ukrainian newspaper \"Dzerkalo Tyzhnia\" and a widow of Oleksandr Razumkov.\n\n"}

The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.\n\nFlaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a narrative. For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the action hero who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a romantic comedy who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension. Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is Achilles' famous heel.\n\nIn general, flaws can be categorized as \"minor\", \"major\", or \"tragic\".\n\nA minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.\n\nExamples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.\n\nProtagonists and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a sympathetic character) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.\n\nMany insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the stock character or archetype that they adhere to.\n\nA major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.\n\nExamples of this type of flaw could include blindness, amnesia or greed.\n\nUnlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.\n\n\nThis is a specific sort of flaw, also known as \"Hamartia\", which is possessed by Aristotelian tragic heros. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.\n\nExamples of this could include hubris, misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.\n\nThis fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1980s he began working for the World Wrestling Federation, where he refereed many historic matches such as Randy Savage versus Ricky Steamboat at WrestleMania III and Randy Savage versus Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania V. Perhaps his most memorable appearance came on the February 5, 1988 episode of \"The Main Event\", when he was assigned to referee a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship between Hulk Hogan and André the Giant. André defeated Hogan after Hebner's twin brother Earl had switched places as Ted DiBiase had locked Dave in a closet. Earl Hebner quickly counted to three as André pinned Hogan, despite Hogan clearly having his shoulder up. The match and the WWF Championship were awarded to André as a result. Both Hebners received a $2,500 bonus for the match.\n\nPrior to WrestleMania IV, the WWF attempted to extend the \"evil twin\" referee storyline through a kayfabe \"investigative report\" published in the promotions' flagship publication, \"WWF Magazine\". The article used a fictional backstory to build sympathy for Dave by claiming he was continually victimized by Earl's misdeeds committed in Dave's name since their childhoods. In a 2001 interview with \"WWF Raw Magazine\", Dave Hebner said the angle was soon dropped after he had suffered broken ribs when Earl kicked him (as part of the aftermath of the Hogan-Andre match during \"The Main Event\"). As a result, the storyline was shifted to have Earl come clean, and he was the referee when Randy Savage won the Tournament final at WrestleMania IV against Ted DiBiase for the WWF Championship.\n\nAfter retiring as a referee following knee replacement surgery, Hebner became a road agent. He worked as a Road Agent until July 2005, when he was released from contract.\n\nAfter being released, Hebner debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the December 17, 2005 episode of \"TNA Impact!\", appearing on the stage during a match between Team 3D and The Diamonds in the Rough.\n\nSince 2012, Dave Hebner has been the manager of The Lumberjacks of MMWA Wrestling.\n\nHebner has been married to his wife Rebecca for 40 years.\nDave's identical twin brother Earl and nephew Brian (Earl's son) are also wrestling referees. Hebner has Parkinson's disease.\n\nIn July 2016, Hebner was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that performers incurred \"long term neurological injuries\" and that the company \"routinely failed to care\" for them and \"fraudulently misrepresented and concealed\" the nature and extent of those injuries. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE.

He became a Baptist minister at Seion, Cwrtnewydd (1841–46), Jerusalem, Rhymney (1846–48 ) and Gwawr, Aberaman from around the beginning of 1849. Soon after his arrival at Aberaman, he became embroiled in a conflict with Thomas Price of Calfaria, Aberdare, who had been instrumental in establishing the new cause at Aberaman. He was accused of being a follower of the Latter Day Saints and the congregation at Gwawr were expelled from the Glamorgan Baptist Association.\n\nIn 1851 he approached William Phillips, leader of the Saints in Wales, and together with four others was baptised in the River Cynon on 27 April 1851, with a crowd of 2,000 in attendance. Gwawr became a LDS Church but the Baptists took legal action to recover the building, In November 1851, Thomas Price led a march to recover the building.

His novel \"Infinite Jest\" (1996) was listed by \"Time\" magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005. His last novel, \"The Pale King\" (2011), was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2012.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" David Ulin called Wallace \"one of the most influential and innovative writers of the last twenty years\". Among the writers who cite Wallace as an influence are Dave Eggers, Zadie Smith, Jonathan Franzen, Elizabeth Wurtzel, George Saunders, Rivka Galchen, Matthew Gallaway, David Gordon, Darin Strauss, Charles Yu, and Deb Olin Unferth.\n\nDavid Foster Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York, to Sally Jean Wallace () and James Donald Wallace, and was raised in Champaign, Illinois, along with his younger sister, Amy Wallace-Havens. His father is an emeritus professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His mother was a professor of English at Parkland College, a community college in Champaign, which recognized her work with a \"Professor of the Year\" award in 1996. When Wallace was in fourth grade, his family moved to nearby Urbana, where he attended Yankee Ridge Elementary School and Urbana High School.\n\nAs an adolescent, he was a regionally ranked junior tennis player, an experience he wrote about in the essay \"Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley\", originally published in \"Harper's Magazine\" as \"Tennis, Trigonometry, Tornadoes\". Although his parents were atheists, Wallace twice attempted to join the Roman Catholic Church, but \"flunk[ed] the period of inquiry\"; he later attended a Mennonite church.\n\nWallace attended Amherst College, his father's alma mater, where he majored in English and philosophy, and graduated \"summa cum laude\" in 1985. Among other extracurricular activities, he participated in glee club; his sister recalls that \"David had a lovely singing voice\". In studying philosophy, Wallace pursued modal logic and mathematics, and presented a senior thesis in philosophy and modal logic that was awarded the Gail Kennedy Memorial Prize and posthumously published as \"Fate, Time, and Language: An Essay on Free Will\" (2011).\n\nBy the time he graduated, with his honors thesis in English becoming the manuscript of his first novel, \"The Broom of the System\" (1987), Wallace had committed himself to being a writer. He told David Lipsky: \"Writing [\"The Broom of the System\"], I felt like I was using ninety-seven percent of me, whereas philosophy was using fifty percent.\" Wallace completed a Master of Fine Arts degree in creative writing at the University of Arizona in 1987. He then moved to Massachusetts to attend graduate school in philosophy at Harvard University, but soon left the program.\n\nWallace's biographer D.T. Max wrote in \"Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story: A Life of David Foster Wallace\" (2012), of Wallace's romantic obsession with the writer Mary Karr in the early 1990s, which resulted in his tattooing her name on his body. He also considered killing her husband. Wallace and Karr later had a tumultuous relationship, during which, Karr has said, Wallace once threw a coffee table at her, and another time tried to push her out of a moving car. In 2002, Wallace met the painter Karen L. Green, whom he married on December 27, 2004.\n\nWallace struggled with depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, and suicidal tendencies, with recurrent psychiatric hospitalizations. He stalked a woman of whom he was enamored.\n\nDogs were important to him, and he spoke of opening a shelter for stray canines. According to his friend Jonathan Franzen, Wallace \"had a predilection for dogs who'd been abused, and [were] unlikely to find other owners who were going to be patient enough for them.\"\n\n\"The Broom of the System\" (1987) garnered national attention and critical praise. In \"The New York Times\", the reviewer Caryn James called the novel a \"manic, human, flawed extravaganza … emerging straight from the excessive tradition of Stanley Elkin's \"The Franchiser\", Thomas Pynchon's \"V.\", [and] John Irving's \"World According to Garp\"\".\n\nIn 1991, Wallace began teaching literature as an adjunct professor at Emerson College in Boston. The next year, at the suggestion of colleague and supporter Steven Moore, Wallace obtained a position in the English department at Illinois State University. He had begun work on his second novel, \"Infinite Jest\", in 1991, and submitted a draft to his editor in December 1993. After the publication of excerpts throughout 1995, the book was published in 1996.\n\nIn 1997, Wallace received a MacArthur Fellowship, as well as the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction, awarded by editors of \"The Paris Review\" for one of the stories in \"Brief Interviews\" which had appeared in the magazine.\n\nIn 2002, he moved to Claremont, California, to become the first Roy E. Disney Professor of Creative Writing and Professor of English at Pomona College. He taught one or two undergraduate courses per semester and focused on writing.\n\nWallace delivered the commencement address to the 2005 graduating class at Kenyon College. The speech was published as a book, \"This Is Water\", in 2009. In May 2013, parts of the speech were used in a popular online video, also titled \"This Is Water\".\n\nBonnie Nadell was Wallace's literary agent during his entire career. Michael Pietsch was his editor on \"Infinite Jest\".\n\nIn March 2009, Little, Brown and Company announced that it would publish the manuscript of an unfinished novel, \"The Pale King\", which Wallace had been working on before his death. \"The Pale King\" was pieced together by Pietsch from pages and notes Wallace left behind. Several excerpts were published in \"The New Yorker\" and other magazines. \"The Pale King\" was published on April 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews. It was also nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThroughout his career, Wallace published short fiction in periodicals such as \"The New Yorker\", \"GQ\", \"Harper's Magazine\", \"Playboy\", \"The Paris Review\", \"Mid-American Review\", \"Conjunctions\", \"Esquire\", \"Open City\", \"Puerto del Sol\", and \"Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern\".\n\nWallace wanted to progress beyond the irony and metafiction associated with postmodernism; in the essay \"E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction\" (1993), he proposed that television has an ironic influence on fiction, and urges literary authors to eschew TV's shallow rebelliousness: \"I want to convince you that irony, poker-faced silence, and fear of ridicule are distinctive of those features of contemporary U.S. culture (of which cutting-edge fiction is a part) that enjoy any significant relation to the television whose weird, pretty hand has my generation by the throat. I'm going to argue that irony and ridicule are entertaining and effective, and that, at the same time, they are agents of a great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that, for aspiring fictionists, they pose terrifically vexing problems.\" Wallace used many forms of irony, but tended to focus on individual persons' continued longing for earnest, un-self-conscious experience and communication in a media-saturated society.\n\nWallace's fiction combines narrative modes and authorial voices that incorporate jargon and invented vocabulary, such as self-generated abbreviations and acronyms, long, multi-clause sentences, and an extensive use of explanatory endnotes and footnotes, as in \"Infinite Jest\" and the story \"Octet\" (collected in \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\") and most of his non-fiction after 1996. In a 1997 interview on \"Charlie Rose\", Wallace said that the notes were to disrupt the linear narrative, to reflect his perception of reality without jumbling the narrative structure, and that he could have jumbled the sentences \"but then no one would read it\".\n\nMax has described Wallace's work as an \"unusual mixture of the cerebral and the hot-blooded\", often featuring multiple protagonists and spanning different locations in a single work. His writing comments on the fragmentation of thought, the relationship between happiness and boredom, and the psychological tension between the beauty and hideousness of the human body. According to Wallace, \"fiction's about what it is to be a fucking human being\", and he said he wanted to write \"morally passionate, passionately moral fiction\" that could help the reader \"become less alone inside\". In his Kenyon College commencement address, Wallace described the human condition as daily crises and chronic disillusionment and warned against succumbing to solipsism, invoking the existential values of compassion and mindfulness:\n\nWallace covered Senator John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign and the September 11 attacks for \"Rolling Stone\"; cruise ships (in what became the title essay of his first nonfiction book), state fairs, and tornadoes for \"Harper's Magazine\"; the US Open tournament for \"Tennis\" magazine; the director David Lynch and the pornography industry for \"Premiere\" magazine; the tennis player Michael Joyce for \"Esquire\"; the movie-special-effects industry for \"Waterstone's\" magazine; conservative talk radio host John Ziegler for \"The Atlantic\"; and a Maine lobster festival for \"Gourmet\" magazine. He also reviewed books in several genres for the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\", and \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\". In the November 2007 issue of \"The Atlantic\", which commemorated the magazine's 150th anniversary, Wallace was among the authors, artists, politicians and others who wrote short pieces on \"the future of the American idea\".\n\nThese and other essays appear in three collections, \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, Consider the Lobster,\" and the posthumous \"Both Flesh and Not,\" the last of which contains some of Wallace's earliest work, including his first published essay, \"Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young\".\n\nSome writers have found parts of Wallace's nonfiction implausible. Franzen has said that he believes Wallace made up dialogue and incidents: \"those things didn't actually happen\". John Cook has remarked that \"Wallace encounters pitch-perfect characters who speak comedically crystalline lines and place him in hilariously absurd situations...I used both stories \"[in teaching journalism]\" as examples of the inescapable temptation to shave, embellish, and invent narratives\".\n\nIn March 2010, the media announced that Wallace's personal papers and archives—drafts of books, stories, essays, poems, letters, and research, including the handwritten notes for \"Infinite Jest\"—had been purchased by the University of Texas at Austin, and they now reside at that university's Harry Ransom Center.\n\nThe first annual David Foster Wallace Conference was hosted by the Illinois State University Department of English in May 2014; the second was held in May 2015.\n\nSince 2011, Loyola University New Orleans has offered English seminar courses on Wallace. Similar courses are also taught at Harvard University.\n\nIn January 2017, the International David Foster Wallace Society and the \"Journal of David Foster Wallace Studies\" were launched.\n\nA feature-length film adaptation of \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\", directed by John Krasinski with an ensemble cast, was released in 2009 and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. It received poor reviews.\n\nThe 19th episode of the 23rd season of \"The Simpsons\", \"A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again\" (2012), is loosely based on Wallace's essay \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again\". The Simpson family takes a cruise, and Wallace appears in the background of a scene, wearing a tuxedo T-shirt while eating in the ship's dining room; Wallace recounted having worn such a T-shirt \"at formal suppers\".\n\nThe 2015 film \"The End of the Tour\" is based on conversations David Lipsky had with Wallace, transcribed in \"Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself\" (2010). Jason Segel played Wallace, and Jesse Eisenberg Lipsky. The film won an Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Sarasota Film Festival, and Segel was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead.\n\n\"Partridge\", a Season 5 episode of NBC's \"Parks and Recreation\", repeatedly references \"Infinite Jest\", of which the show's co-creator, Michael Schur, is a noted fan. Schur also directed the music video for The Decemberists' \"Calamity Song\", which depicts the Eschaton game from \"Infinite Jest.\"\n\nTwelve of the interviews from \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\" were adapted into a stage play in 2000, the first theatrical adaptation of Wallace's work. The play, \"Hideous Men\", adapted and directed by Dylan McCullough, premiered at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2000.\n\n\"Brief Interviews\" was also adapted by director Marc Caellas as a play, \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Writers\", which premiered at Fundación Tomás Eloy Martinez in Buenos Aires on November 4, 2011.\n\nThe short story \"Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko\" from \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\" was adapted by composer Eric Moe into a 50-minute operatic piece, to be performed with accompanying video projections. The piece was described as having \"subversively inscribed classical music into pop culture\".\n\n\"Infinite Jest\" was performed once as a stage play by Germany's experimental theater Hebbel am Ufer. The play was staged in various locations throughout Berlin, and the action took place over a 24-hour period.\n\n\"Good Old Neon\", from \"\", was adapted and performed by Ian Forester at the 2011 Hollywood Fringe Festival, produced by the Los Angeles independent theater company Needtheater.\n\nThe song \"Surrounded by Heads and Bodies\" from the album \"A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships\" by The 1975, borrows its title from the opening line of \"Infinite Jest\". Matty Healy, he lead singer of The 1975, revealed in a interview with Pitchfork discussing the new album that he was inspired by the novel after reading it during a stint in rehab: \"I was reading [\"Infinite Jest\"] when I was in rehab. There was no one there. It was me and my nurses, who’d come in and check on me, and then Angela [the protagonist of the song], miles away. I was surrounded by no one, and the book was just open on the front page, as most copies of \"Infinite Jest\" are ... nobody reads [\"Infinite Jest\"] all the way! Everyone our age has got a battered, quarter-read copy of \"Infinite Jest\".\"\n\nWallace's father said that David had suffered from major depressive disorder for more than 20 years and that antidepressant medication had allowed him to be productive. Wallace experienced severe side effects from the medication and in June 2007 stopped taking phenelzine, his primary antidepressant drug, on his doctor's advice. His depression recurred, and he tried other treatments, including electroconvulsive therapy. Eventually he went back on phenelzine but found it ineffective. On September 12, 2008, at age 46, Wallace wrote a two-page suicide note, arranged part of the manuscript for \"The Pale King\" and hanged himself from a rafter of his house.\n\nMemorial gatherings were held at Pomona College, Amherst College, the University of Arizona, Illinois State University, and on October 23, 2008, at New York University (NYU). The eulogists at NYU included his sister, Amy Wallace-Havens; his literary agent, Bonnie Nadell; Gerry Howard, editor of his first two books; Colin Harrison, an editor at \"Harper's Magazine\"; Michael Pietsch, editor of \"Infinite Jest\" and later works; Deborah Treisman, fiction editor at \"The New Yorker\" magazine; and the writers Don DeLillo, Zadie Smith, George Saunders, Mark Costello, Donald Antrim, and Jonathan Franzen.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This group comprises the antagonists of the third major story arc, which is called the \"Infinity\" in the manga and \"Sailor Moon S\" in the anime. They are first introduced in chapter #24 \"Infinity 1 – Premonition\", originally published in Japan on July 7, 1994. In the Cloverway English adaptation, they are called the \"Heart Snatchers\".\n\nOriginally from the \"Tau Ceti Star System\" in another dimension, the Death Busters acquire human host bodies to act through with Kaolinite and Professor Tomoe as acting leaders. Based in , an elite high school built in the middle of Tokyo's , the Death Busters work to gather human souls which would prolong their dying homeworld. Their ultimate goal is the revival of their commander Mistress 9 so they can bring their master Pharaoh 90 to Earth and terraform it into a new home at the cost of the current life forms.\n\n is the leader of the Death Busters and Hotaru Tomoe's father. A genetic scientist forced out of the scientific community for his unethical experiments, he sold his findings to companies and bought the entire Sankakusu District to continue his research to create \"Super Beings\". But a fire occurs in Tomoe's apartment that killed his wife Keiko and gravely wounded his daughter Hotaru. Tomoe saves his daughter by outfitting her body with cybernetic limbs during a freak storm that brought the Death Busters to Earth, the aliens apparently attracted to his darkness. Witnessing his assistant be reborn as Kaolinite, Tomoe sold his soul to Pharaoh 90 and willfully discards his humanity by ingesting a Daimon Egg to become a hybrid as he began to build Mugen Academy while working to perfect the stability of Daimon/human hybrids. When Super Sailor Moon and the Outer Guardians arrive at his lab and dispatch his Daimon test subjects, Tomoe changes into his Daimon form . Sailor Moon is forced to kill Tomoe with her Rainbow Moon Heart Ache, Hotaru briefly seen saying goodbye to her father while accepting that he died a long time ago after her mother's death.\n\nIn the first anime, Hotaru's injury and the Death Busters' arrival occurring at the same time, Professor Tomoe's story is the same with the exception that he was forcefully possessed by Germatoid. Tomoe also survived the ordeal as Germatoid left his body and is destroyed by Sailor Uranus and Neptune, attempting to reach Hotaru and later losing his memories following the final battle as he is entrusted with his reborn daughter's care until the season premiere of \"Sailor Stars\", when Setsuna Meioh comes to retrieve her, and after that he is not seen again in the series.\n\nProfessor Tomoe appears in several musicals. In the \"Last Dracul\" arc, his body is possessed by an alchemist known as . Using Tomoe's laboratory, Berserk tries to create perfect homunculi in order to replace human beings; however, his first homunculi, the Death Mannetjes, turned out to be flawed creatures. Although Tomoe is possessed by Berserk, the latter shows concern for Hotaru.\n\nProfessor Tomoe is voiced by Akira Kamiya in \"Sailor Moon S\" and by Takuya Kirimoto in \"Crystal\". In the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation produced in association with Optimum Productions, he is voiced by Jeff Lumby. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by Keith Silverstein. In the musicals, he has been portrayed by Shunsaku Yajima, Ryuuji Kasahara, Kaname Aoki and Yuuki Kaon.\n\n is the Commander of the Witches 5 with the title of Magus, named after the mineral of the same name. Originally , she was Tomoe's assistant before being infected with a Daimon Egg that consumes her humanity while pledging her loyalty to Pharaoh 90. Serving as Pharaoh 90's emissary, with access to Tairon Crystal, Kaolinite convinces Tomoe to offer himself and Hotaru to the Death Busters. Despite no longer being human, Kaolinite retained some of her former self like her infatuation with Tomoe. Posing as Mugen Academy's headmistress, communicating with Pharaoh 90 to relay his orders, Kaolinite directs the Witches 5 to deal with the Sailor Guardians and eventually take the Legendary Silver Crystal while also making attempts to prevent the awakening of Sailor Saturn whom she deemed a threat to her group. After the Witches 5 have all been killed and Mistress 9 had awakened, Kaolinite is given the task to kill the Sailor Guardians herself before the Outer Guardians intervene. This forces Kaolinite to assume her Daimon form prior to being destroyed by Super Sailor Moon's Rainbow Moon Heartache attack.\n\nIn the first anime adaptation, her role is changed to oversee the initial Death Buster attacks, Kaolinite seeks out the three Talismans to obtain the Legendary Holy Grail. Her Daimons having attacked Sailor Mars, Sailor Mercury, and Sailor Jupiter prior, Kaolinite targets Sailor Moon while deducing her identity and ends up appearing to fall to death from Tokyo Tower in the resulting battle. But Kaolinite survived, though she lost her memory and Tomoe placed her Hotaru's guardian. Kaolinite eventually regains her memories, stealing Chibiusa's Pure Heart to offer to Mistress 9 so she can win Tomoe's love. But Kaolinite, after Tomoe congratulated her, is killed off when she is thrown into an electrified wall by Mistress 9 for \"having served her purpose.\"\n\nThe stage musicals follow the manga version, though no mention of what was occurring at the time of the lightning strike is made, and the event is not shown, only mentioned. The musicals imply Kaori to be her original name, as she is always addressed as Kaori-Kun in Hotaru's presence by Professor Tomoe who states she has been helping them out since, at least, his wife's death. In \"Usagi Ai no Senshi e no Michi\", she leads another set of minions, the Death Nightmares.\n\nIn \"Sailor Moon S\", she is voiced by Noriko Uemura. In \"Crystal\", she is voiced by Hikari Yono. In the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation, her name is changed to Kaorinite (though she retains her original name in her second incarnation) and is voiced by Kirsten Bishop.

But Mistress 9 did not fully awaken with Hotaru suffering seizure fits that reside while in the presence of a Tairon Crystal fragment, though Mistress 9 slowly becomes more active when exposed to the light of the Legendary Silver Crystal. After the Witches 5 have all been killed, her influence overwhelming Hotaru as she force grows her vessel into a woman with long hair, Mistress 9 steals Chibiusa's soul and Legendary Silver Crystal while using the latter as a replacement power source when she conducts the ritual to summon Pharaoh 90 to Earth. As Pharaoh 90 begins to manifest, Mistress 9 attempts to rip herself out of Hotaru's body to assume her true form. But Mistress 9 is surprised to find that Hotaru's soul still exists and is inhibiting the entity from leaving her body, managing to thwart her by forcing her to leave his body to restore the souls of the Inner Guardians and Chibiusa to their bodies. Mistress 9 attempts to steal Sailor Moon's Silver Crystal before Sailor Chibimoon arrives, both assuming their Super forms to overwhelm Mistress 9. But when Pharaoh 90 fully manifests, Mistress 9 allows herself to be assimilated into her master with Sailor Saturn later manifesting from what remained of Mistress 9.\n\nIn the anime, Mistress 9 makes her presence known early as she occasionally controls Hotaru to communicate with the Death Busters. But Mistress 9 fully awakens once obtaining Chibiusa's Pure Heart Crystal, killing Kaolinite for serving her purpose in her revival. Mistress 9 attempts to use a large machine to guide Pharaoh 90 to Earth so that he may destroy it. Sailor Moon tries to stop her and Tomoe, now freed from Germatoid, attempts to reach her, still seeing her as Hotaru. She attacks both of them but is injured by energy emanating from the machine. Tomoe takes her in his arms and Hotaru's spirit begins to respond. Mistress 9 attempts to subdue her once again but Hotaru's memories of both her father and of Chibiusa prove to be overpowering. It results with Hotaru awakening as Sailor Saturn, her power destroying Mistress 9 at the cost of her body.\n\nIn \"Sailor Moon S\", Mistress 9's voice is provided by Yuko Minaguchi and Yukiyo Fujii provides her voice in \"Crystal\".

As the Tairon Crystal that he uses for substance is nearly spent with his domain on the verge of collapse, Pharaoh 90 uses the spatial distortions in Tokyo's Sankakusu district to send an advance guard of Daimon Eggs to make preparations for his coming. Pharaoh 90's goal is assimilate Earth and terraform it into a new home for himself and his Daimon spawn. As his right hand Mistress 9 was inactive at the time, Pharaoh 90 communicated with Kaolinte at the top of Mugen Academy as he senses both the Legendary Silver Crystal and an unawakened Sailor Saturn whom he expresses dread towards.\n\nMistress 9 retrieved Chibiusa's future Silver Crystal with Pharaoh deeming it as a replacement for the obsolete Tairon Crystal as he is brought to Earth via an established portal. Once on Earth, Sailor Moon describing his form as that of \"black lava reeking of death\", Pharaoh absorbs Mistress 9 while beginning to cover the entire Earth despite the Outer Guardians' attempts to contain him within Sankakusu. With Pharaoh 90 able to absorb their attacks, Sailor Moon attempted to sacrifice herself by unleashing the powers of the Legendary Holy Grail and the Silver Crystal while within the entity. But the gambit caused the Outer Guardians' Talismans to resonate and awaken Sailor Saturn, who uses her \"Death Reborn Revolution\" to weaken Pharaoh 90 but stayed her hand from killing him when Sailor Moon emerged unharmed. The dying Pharaoh 90 attempts to flee back into the Tau System as Saturn gives chase, having Sailor Pluto use her \"Dark Dome Close\" to seal the dimensional distortion and trap Pharaoh 90 within his dying world. Like all of the head villains in the manga, Pharaoh 90 is later revealed to be an incarnation of Chaos, the ultimate enemy of the series.\n\nIn \"Sailor Moon S\", Pharaoh 90 appears as a huge, black eyeball-like sphere with tentacles who is simply acting on an impulse to destroy Earth and recruited Tomoe by providing him with Mistress 9's Daimon Egg. When portal is opened by Mistress 9, Pharaoh 90 begins to surface before being destroyed by Sailor Moon (empowered by the other Soldiers) and the newly awakened Sailor Saturn.\n\nPharaoh 90 is voiced by Takaya Hashi in \"Crystal\", with Michael Sorich (in his first two appearances) and John Eric Bentley voicing him in the English version. Jeff Lumby provides vocal effects in the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation.\n\nThe is a subset of the Death Busters led by Kaolinite, artificial human/Daimon hybrids created by Tomoe. The Witches 5 pose as Mugen Academy prefects while given the task to gather souls, or \"Hostes,\" of the student body to both prolong the Tau Ceti Star System and provide vessels for Daimon Eggs. They are seen as either being equal to or stronger than the main Sailor Guardians, whom they target for their interference with the promise of being promoted to Magus level. Kaolinite would later revive the Witches 5 as Mugen Academy's first line of defense when the Sailor Guardians storm the school.\n\nIn the anime, the Witches 5 are led by Professor Tomoe and work as researchers in an underground lab and compete amongst themselves for his approval. While first given the task to search for the Talismans until Eudial's death, altering the \"Witches 5\" sign on their door to reflect the number of remaining members, the remaining Witches 5 members are later instructed by Mistress 9 to find \"pure hearts\" instead. In the Cloverway English adaptation, the name is changed to Bureau of Bad Behavior.\n\n is the first member of the Witches 5 who appears. She is a red-haired humanoid with a rank of Level 78 and able to use the \"Fire Buster\" flame torrent attack, named for the mineral Eudialyte is her namesake. Under the alias of , she is the Etiquette class prefect in charge of Mugen Academy's Philosophy division. Eudial uses her position to bring newly enrolled students to a mountain retreat on \"Mount M\" for an orientation that doubles as a ritual to extract their Hosties. While retaining her human form in \"Crystal\", Eudial assumes her medusa-like Daimon form to overwhelm Sailors Mars and Jupiter when they interfere before being killed by Sailor Moon. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5 for her curse against the Sailor Guardians, Eudial targets Mars's insecurities and later attacks Sailor Moon before destroyed by the Outer Guardians.\n\nIn the anime, Eudial seems to be the oldest of the group, and is much resented by the others — particularly Mimete — because Professor Tomoe seems to favor her. She is referred to as Chief by the other members. Eudial is generally fairly even-tempered and level-headed; however, she is also portrayed as a reckless driver. A brilliant inventor, she is able to construct and jury rig weaponry and computer technology through the use of everyday items, like her deadly shoulder-mounted flamethrower, the Fire Buster, and later in the series booby-traps the under-construction Marine Cathedral. Eudial actually succeeds in getting two of the Talismans, but loses them to Sailor Pluto. She uses the Fire Buster to try to attack Super Sailor Moon, but she deflects it back to her. Furious, she escapes in her car, only to find that Mimete has torn out its brakes and filled it with snails. The car crashes through a barrier into the sea below, killing her instantly.\n\nVoice actor Maria Kawamura provides her voice for the original Japanese production and Chiaki Takahashi voices her in \"Crystal\".

When the other Sailor Guardians arrive, Mimete is forced to fight them with support from Daimons created from some of the students. But she ends up being killed by Sailor Uranus. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5 for her curse against the Sailor Guardians, Mimete targets Venus through her fantasy and later attacks Sailor Moon before destroyed by the Outer Guardians.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, while ditzy and targeting celebrities, Mimete is assigned to collect Pure Heart Crystals after she orchestrated Eudial's death. Out of all the Witches 5, she is the least organized and the most easily distracted. She can launch mirages in the shape of stars at her opponents and induces severe vertigo and disorientation, capable of rendering someone unconscious in seconds. After several failed attempts at collecting hearts, she tries to use one of Eudial's abandoned inventions (Witches Electric Warp). The machine would transport a person inside of a television, which would increase that person's power exponentially. However, if the power to the television were disconnected while the user was still inside, the user would be trapped within it forever (the exact reason why Eudial never used it). Tellu mercilessly imprisons Mimete by pulling the plug off the machine.\n\nIn the original anime, she is voiced by Mika Kanai and in \"Crystal\", she is voiced by Yuki Nagaku.

Viluy attempts to take Mercury's soul, but ends up being killed by Sailor Uranus. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5 for her curse against the Sailor Guardians, Viluy targets Mercury's insecurities and later attacks Sailor Moon before destroyed by the Outer Guardians.\n\nIn the anime, Viluy is handed the task of gathering pure hearts after Tellu's death. She collects the pure hearts from the students using a supercomputer, controlled by her wristband. She overpowers Sailors Mercury, Uranus and Neptune using nano machines controlled by her wristband. Sailor Moon damages Viluy's wristband and the Witch ends up being consumed when her Mosaic Buster rebounded on her.\n\nViluy also appears in the stage musicals. She is voiced by Yoshino Takamori in the original anime and by Rina Hon'izumi in \"Crystal\". In the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation, her names were changed to \"Byruit\" and \"Julie Bidoh\" and is voiced by Daniela Olivieri.

She acts under the alias of and is prefect of Mugen Academy's Physical Education class and Botanical Garden, providing a number of her artificial Telluns plants to the populace to absorb Hostes from their victims. Though her scheme is found out by the Sailor Guardians as they confront her, Tellu overpowers the Sailor Guardians before assuming her Daimon form to finish them off. But Tellu ends up being killed by a newly re-awakened Sailor Pluto. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5 for her curse against the Sailor Guardians, Tellu targets Jupiter's insecurities and later attacks Sailor Moon before destroyed by the Outer Guardians.\n\nIn the first anime, after deposing of Mimet, Tellu's role is slightly different as she opens a flower shop to sale her Telluns before being confronted by Sailors Moon, Chibi Moon, Pluto, and Tuxedo Mask. When her Telluns being destroyed, Tellu mutates the last into a Hyper-Tellun to kill the group. But Tuxedo Mask hurls one of his roses at Tellu and causes her to lose the Pure Heart Crystals she gathered, resulting with her being attacked by her own creation. Tellu electrocutes the Hyper-Tellun in an attempt to break free, but it self-destructs and she is consumed in the explosion.\n\nShe was voiced by Chieko Honda until episode 31 of \"Sailor Moon S\". In \"Crystal\", she is voiced by Naomi Ozora. In the Cloverway Inc. English adaptation, her name is changed to \"Telulu\" and is voiced by Julie Lemieux. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Laura Post. In the musicals, she is played by Mio Nunokawa, Akiko Iwasaki and Momoko Sadachi.\n\n and are collectively the final member of the Witches 5 with a rank of Level 999 and able to use the \"Ribbon Buster\" attack.

The two are named for the minerals cyprine and clinoptilolite.\n\nAs prefect of Mugen Academy's business division and sorcery class, Cyprine is tasked by Kaolinite specifically to take care of Haruka and Michiru after the two revealed their true colors. While caught off guard that her quarry are Sailors, Cyprine uses her power to have all the Sailor Guardians save Sailor Moon turn on each other. While she and Ptilol split to dodge her initial attack on them, Sailor Moon manages to kill the twin witches after transforming into Super Sailor Moon and using her \"Rainbow Moon Heartache\" attack on them again. When Kaolinite revives the Witches 5, Cyprine and Ptilol oversee the Sailor Guardians ensnarement in their trap. After their teammates dealt with the other Sailor Guardians, the twins join the other Witches 5 in overwhelming Sailor Moon before they are all destroyed by the Outer Guardians.\n\nIn the anime, while still the last of the Witches 5, Cyprine's story is altered to have her make a final attempt of gathering Pure Hearts for Mistress 9's revival. When the Sailor Guardians interfere, she and Ptilol split and overwhelm the group with one twin blocking an attack aimed at the other and using the absorbed energy to counter while increasing their power. But the Sailors formulate a counter strategy with Sailor Mercury using her Bubble spray to obscure the area so they can force Cyprine and Ptilol apart, tricking the two into blasting each other as both are killed when their staves are overloaded by the excess energy.\n\nIn \"Sailor Moon S\", Yuriko Fuchizaki did the voice of Cyprine and Rumi Kasahara did the voice of Ptilol. In \"Crystal\", they are both voiced by Umeka Shōji. In the Cloverway Inc. English version, their names are changed to \"Cyprin\" and \"Petirol\". They are voiced by Naomi Emmerson and Sara Sahr. In the Viz Media English adaptations, both Cyprine and Ptilol are voiced by Dorothy Elias-Fahn.

They are four men portrayed as thinking highly of themselves and as masters of disguise. The Mannetjes are tasked with finding the talismans, and are rivals of Kaolinite's own set of minions: the Death Nightmares. They are killed by the Sailor Soldiers, but are revived by Sailor Moon at the end of the musical. Their leader is Death Ra, and other members include Death Ri, Death Ru and Death Debu Re. They are respectively played by Ryuuji Kasahara, Masakazu Idono, Masayuki Ozaki, and Kouhei Kowada.\n\nThe Death Mannetjes appear in the \"Last Dracul\" musical. They are homunculi created by Undead Berserk while he takes over Tomoe's body and laboratory. They have no relation to the Death Busters in this version. The Mannetjes have different names in this continuity: Death Pa, Death Pi, Death Pu and Death Pe. They are respectively portrayed by Jun Kanzaki, Seiko Takuma, Takashi Kashiwagi and Yoshiya Yukimura.\n\nThe are nameless servants of Kaolinite the musical \"Usagi Ai no Senshi e no Michi\". They are portrayed as beautiful, seductive women with silver hair, and have a rivalry with the Death Manntjes in the heart snatching. They use a Daimon named Gondola to steal Chibiusa's pure crystal heart, but they are stopped by Sailors Uranus and Neptune, and later killed by the Soldiers, only to be revived by Sailor Moon at the end of the musical. They are played by Kaori Ishikawa, Ado Endou, Yuuko Matsumoto, Eri Ikemoto, Hisako Doubayashi, Yoshiko Nakahara, and Junko Oyama.\n\nIn the \"Last Dracul\" musical, they are female dream demons, appearing again as beautiful and seductive women but with dark hair. Some of them are named in this arc: Olam Tiphareth, Roi Malkuth, and Elyon Yesod; however, there are other unnamed members. They have no relation to the Death Busters in this version; since Kaolinite does not appear in this musical, their leader is Undead Berserk's right-hand woman, . The \"Last Dracul\" Death Nightmares are portrayed by Miki Kawasaki, Ado Endou, Noriko Yamakawa, Junko Yamauchi, and Izumi Ogino.\n\nThe are purplish-skinned amorphous monsters deployed by the Death Busters to carry out several tasks, normally used as their enforcers. Being a form of life native to the Tau System, the Daimons that manifest on Earth as special pods called Daimon Eggs which need to assimilate host bodies in a process called Vesselization to survive the planet's conditions, both Kaolinite and a willing Tomoe being such examples of the hybridization. But when Tomoe attempted to replicate the process he used to create the Witches 5, a process that combines genetic manipulation and cybernetic modification, the result are malformed Atavized worm creatures which the others called failed experiments despite Tomoe's opinion of the monsters. When defeated, humans recently turned into Daimons revert to their original state while the Daimon Egg shatters upon being ejected.\n\nIn the first anime, the Cloverway dub calling them \"Heart Snatchers\" or \"Demonaes\", the Daimons serve as monsters-of-the-day. Appearing as red feminine liquid humanoids in their natural state, the Daimons are artificially created by Tomoe and Vesselize objects to assume personalized form. The first batch of Daimon Eggs used by Kaolinte were allowed to randomly enter objects on their whim and possess a Death Buster mark somewhere on their bodies that allows them to extract a Heart Crystal from their target. When Eudial takes over search for he Talismans, Tomoe built an specialized oven to create fixed Vesselizations with the resulting Daimons created as bodyguards for the witch. The final batch of Daimons, combining the roles of the previous two with the task to revive Mistress 9, are created by Tomoe to aid Mimete and are modified with cormorant traits so they can suck out a Heart Crystal by simply kissing their prey. When defeated, the object reverts to its original state with the Daimon Egg destroyed in the process. After the remaining Witches 5 have all been killed, the remaining Daimon Eggs all hatched and serve as a barrier to prevent the Sailor Guardians from entering Mugen Academy. After the final battle, one Daimon survived and Vesselized with the oven to become .

He read Modern Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London in 1946-47 before moving on to read the Oriental Studies at Cambridge from 1947-50. He was a lecturer at the University of London (1954–56) and Cambridge (1956–60), the Chair of Chinese at the universities of London (1960–68) and Cambridge (1968–80), and the Gordon Wu '58 Professor of Chinese Studies at Princeton University (1980–94). He was a fellow of the British Academy from 1967. He greatly expanded the role of Chinese studies in Western intellectual circles.\n\nDuring World War II, Twitchett took a crash course in Japanese and for the remainder of the war he was part of the Bletchley Park operations acting as a listener at one of the forward listening stations in Sri Lanka. After the war he gained a degree in geography at Cambridge. He also spent a great deal of time in Japan and was able to learn from the best Japanese historians of China (who tended to focus on Tang China, a period which became his field of expertise also). He married Umeko Ichikawa in 1956. Together they had two children.\n\nStarting in 1966, Professor Twitchett and historian John K. Fairbank (who taught at Harvard) began plans for the first comprehensive history of China to be published in the English language. Originally expected to be a six volume set of books, the series expanded as time passed and eventually grew to the currently planned 15 volumes. While he was at Princeton, Twitchett worked closely with fellow Sinologist Frederick W. Mote (who had a related wartime experience). \n\nDrawing upon the most respected living historians for individual chapters of the books, the series (though still incomplete as of late 2007) is very highly regarded as an authoritative history of China. Twitchett wrote many sections and guided the creation of the whole series from the start until his death.\n\nTwitchett deliberately held off creating a book on China before the Ch'in because, as Twitchett put it in the preface to Volume 7, there was still so much work to be done on the period. Since that time the history has become better understood and in 1999 a companion volume \"The Cambridge History of Ancient China, From the Origins of Civilization to 221 BC\" edited by Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy was published.\n\n\nTwitchett was the expert who helped create the China maps for \"The Times Atlas of World History\" (first published in 1979).\n\n"}

It was later adopted by the Chinese communists. In both the early Chinese and Russian politburos, \"strongman politics\" played a large role in internal decision-making. Politburos under both Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong were later criticized for being dysfunctional and largely decorative, allowing the top leaders to dictate both party policy and the fate of the other leaders.\n\nUnder Deng Xiaoping, important decisions were often made in Deng's home with a caucus of eight senior party cadres, called \"Eight Elders\". Deng ruled as paramount leader, although he never held the top title of the party or the state. However, Deng was able to remove three Party leaders with the aid of the Eight Elders. Hua Guofeng was gradually removed from Premier and Party Chairman between 1980 and 1981; Hu Yaobang was removed in 1987; and, Zhao Ziyang was removed in 1989.\n\nDescendants of the Eight Elders who have benefited significantly from nepotism and cronyism constitute a group now known as \"the Princelings\" or the \"Crown Prince Party\". Its members, rising through party ranks, can easily overrule any opposition in their jurisdictions, even if they are assigned to a local administrative position. They are often seen to outrank other party officials and possess greater prestige due to their lineage. Bloomberg has reported on the extensive wealth accumulated by these descendants via their roles in various public and private companies.\n\n\n"}

He was executed in 2008 in Huntsville, Texas, becoming the 1128th murderer to be executed in the United States since 1976. He was the 13th murderer executed in Texas in 2008 and the 418th murderer executed in Texas since 1976.\n\nNicole Benton from Hockley, Texas disappeared on March 23, 1995, during a birthday party organized by her father Buddy Benton, a friend and neighbor of Eric Nenno who lived a few houses down the road in a house belonging to the Bentons.\n\nAs Buddy was playing with his country music band, Nenno lured Nicole, who was playing in the front yard, to his home on the pretense of getting a guitar to join the group. The moment Nenno and Nicole were inside his home he struggled to rape her. As Nicole cried and resisted, he strangled her to death. He raped her lifeless body for several days and hid her corpse in his attic, stuffing her clothing in a filing cabinet. Nicole's polka-dot dress, glasses, and shoes were later found in this cabinet.\n\nA few days after Nicole's disappearance, law enforcement agents showed up at Nenno's home to question him. Neighbors had told Detective Johnson that Nenno, a former plumbing supply salesman, had been accused of groping a six-year-old neighborhood girl two years before. Johnson then referred it to Detectives Wedgeworth and Taber for a follow-up investigation and they went to the Nenno's home at 17602 Bullis Gap three times on the afternoon of March 25, 1995. On two occasions Nenno did not answer the door.\n\nOn the third occasion, Nenno, dressed only in a white bath-towel around his waist, finally answered the door. Nenno indicated that he was willing to talk about the missing girl, and invited the detectives to enter the house. He seemed very cooperative and willing to speak. When the detectives asked him whether he knew Nicole, he became visibly nervous and shaky, and denied knowing or ever seeing her before. Nenno then allowed the detectives to search his house. Detective Wedgeworth conducted a brief search, but found nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe detectives asked Nenno why someone in the neighborhood would suggest that he be checked out. He replied that there had been an incident in the spring when he was accused of trying to lure a girl into his house and pull off her pants. After this question, Nenno became visibly shaken and much more nervous. The two detectives had been at Nenno's house for approximately ten minutes, and before leaving, asked him if he would go to the command post for further questioning. After signing a legal release, Nenno stated he had no problem with that. Police informed him that a trailer had been set up several blocks away as a command post during the ongoing search for Nicole by law enforcement and volunteers from the community of Hockley. Wedgeworth and Taber later stated that they made no promises or threats to Nenno during this initial encounter. After dressing, Nenno showed up a few minutes later at the command post and Detective Taber read Nenno his Miranda rights. \n\nTaber asked Nenno if he understood his rights and he indicated that he did. Taber then asked him if he wanted to waive his rights and talk about the missing girl; he agreed to talk to the detectives. He appeared to understand the interview process which was conducted in a very moderate tone. Taber spoke with Nenno for almost an hour, and during the interview he was offered food and drink. From the start of the interview, Detective Taber reminded Nenno that he was not under arrest, and could leave at any time.\n\nWhen Detective Taber asked Nenno if he knew why he was there, he replied: “You think I'm a suspect in the missing little girl's case”. \nTaber then asked him why he thought that he would be considered a suspect. Nenno replied that it was because of a past incident when he had lured a little girl to his residence and removed her pants, and because he liked children. When asked what he had done the night Nicole had disappeared, he stated that he had arrived home, changed clothes, gone outside and talked to his neighbor, and then went back inside. Nenno said he had been drinking a six-pack of beer. When asked if there was any reason why a neighbor would say that they had seen him on the same street where Nicole had disappeared, Nenno responded: “Well, maybe I could have been outside my house by the fence, but I just don't remember”. Taber asked Nenno the same question again and he replied: “Well, it might have been possible but I don't remember”.\n\nAfter a polygraph, authorities remained silent for several minutes, prompting Nenno to finally say: \"I failed it, didn't I?″ When the examiner told Nenno he needed to disclose the girl's location, Nenno said: \"I think she's still in the attic″. He then said: \"They're going to kill me for this, aren't they?\"\n\nFinally Nenno gave written authorization to law enforcement to search his home. During the search of Nenno's house, Nicole's body Nicole was found and Nenno was arrested. Nicole had been choked to death and raped repeatedly.\n\nIn his confession, Nenno admitted to having sexual visions of young girls for most of his life, as well raping and strangling Nicole in his bedroom.\n\nOn February 1, 1996 the Harris County jury, that heard the case, deliberated for about 11 hours, before deciding on the death penalty for Eric Nenno.\n\nIn an interview from death row one week before his scheduled execution, Nenno said that, at the time of the killing, he was addicted to pornography and had been drinking. He also said that nothing could excuse his crime. \"I can't apologize enough\", he said.\n\nOn January 18, 1996 a Harris County jury convicted Nenno of capital murder; he was sentenced to death by the District Court in Harris County on February 1st. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Nenno's conviction and sentence on June 24, 1998. Nenno filed an application for state habeas corpus on October 16, 1998 but was denied relief on November 14, 2001.\nNenno petitioned the federal courts for writ of habeas corpus relief on October 18, 2002; the federal district court dismissed Nenno's case without prejudice on January 13, 2004. Nenno filed a successive application for state habeas corpus relief on February 11, 2004 which was dismissed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals June 23, 2004. On August 10, 2004 Nenno returned to federal court, and petitioned for habeas relief. On March 7, 2006 the U.S. District Court denied habeas relief, and denied a COA. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied his application for a COA on June 6, 2007. On March 24, 2008 the U. S. Supreme Court denied certiorari review.\nOn June 10, 2008, Nenno petitioned for clemency with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n\nOn October 28, 2008, Eric Charles Nenno, was executed by lethal injection in Huntsville Unit in Texas. Nenno did not look at Buddy Benton or the other members of the victim's family who attended his execution. When asked if he wanted to make a last statement, he replied, \"No, warden.\" The lethal injection was then started. He gasped four times and eight minutes later at 6:20 p.m., Nenno was pronounced dead.\n\nHis last meal was a grilled cheeseburger, four fish patties, six hard boiled eggs and some coffee.\n\n\n"}

He practiced law in Terre Haute, Indiana. From 1917 until 1925 Sanders represented Indiana in the United States Congress.

{"id": "24339257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24339257", "title": "Fetch (folklore)", "text": "Fetch (folklore)\n\nA fetch is a supernatural double or an apparition of a living person in Irish folklore. It is largely akin to the doppelgänger, and sightings are regarded as omens, usually for impending death. The origin of the term is unclear.\n\nThe fetch is described as an exact, spectral double of a living human, whose appearance is regarded as ominous. As such, it is similar to the Germanic doppelgänger, and to some conceptions of the British wraith. Francis Grose associated the term with Northern England in his 1787 \"Provincial Glossary\", but otherwise it seems to have been in popular use only in Ireland. A sighting of a fetch is generally taken as a portent of its exemplar's looming death, though John and Michael Banim report that if the double appears in the morning rather than the evening, it is instead a sign of a long life in store.\n\nThe etymology is obscure. It may derive from the verb \"fetch\"; the compound \"fetch-life\", evidently referring to a psychopomp who \"fetches\" the souls of the dying, is attested in Richard Stanyhurst's 1583 translation of the \"Aeneid\". Alternately, the word may derive from \"fæcce\", found in two Old English glossaries. In both texts, \"fæcce\" is glossed for \"mære\", a spirit associated with death and nightmares. The word may be Old English in origin, though it would have been atypical for the author to gloss one English word with another. He seems to have regarded it as a Latin word, though it is unattested in Latin. Instead, it may be Irish, which could be the origin of the Hiberno-English \"fetch\".\n\nThe term \"fetch\" is sometimes glossed for the Scandinavian \"fylgja\", an animal alter ego in Norse mythology connected to a person's fate, though unlike the Irish concept, the \"fylgja\" is almost always female.\n\nCorresponding to its contemporary prominence in \"national superstitions\", the fetch appeared in Irish literature starting in early 19th century. \"The fetch superstition\" is the topic of John and Michael Banim's Gothic story \"The Fetches\", from their 1825 work \"Tales by the O'Hara Family\". Patrick Kennedy's 1866 folklore collection \"Legendary Fiction of the Irish Celts\" includes a brief account of \"The Doctor's Fetch\", in which a fetch's appearance signals death for the titular doctor. More recently, \"The Fetch\" is the malevolent narrator of Patrick McCabe's 2010 novel \"The Stray Sod Country\", wherein it temporarily inhabits the bodies of the residents of a small Irish town, causing them to commit both psychological and physical harm to themselves and others. The deuteragonist of Catherynne M. Valente's 2015 novel The Boy Who Lost Fairyland is a fetch who is quickly recognized by the parents of the dying child she is to replace and is able to overcome her destructive nature in their care.\n\n"}

From 2003 to 2008, he served as Brazil's Minister of Culture in the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Gil's musical style incorporates an eclectic range of influences, including rock, Brazilian genres including samba, African music, and reggae.\n\nGil started to play music as a child and was a teenager when he joined his first band. He began his career as a bossa nova musician and grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the Música popular brasileira and tropicália movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator Caetano Veloso. The Brazilian military regime that took power in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to Bahia in 1972 and continued his musical career, as well as working as a politician and environmental advocate.\n\nGil was born in Salvador and spent much of his childhood in nearby Ituaçu. Ituaçu was a small town of fewer than a thousand people, located in the sertão, or countryside, of Bahia. His father, José Gil Moreira, was a doctor; his mother, Claudina Passos Gil Moreira, an elementary school teacher. As a young boy, he attended a Marist Brothers school. Gil remained in Ituaçu until he was nine years old, returning to Salvador for secondary school.\n\nGil's interest in music was precocious: \"When I was only two or two and a half\", he recalled, \"I told my mother I was going to become a musician or a president of my country\". He grew up listening to the forró music of his native northeast, and took an interest in the street performers of Salvador. Early on, he began to play the drums and the trumpet, through listening to Bob Nelson on the radio. Gil's mother was the \"chief supporter\" in his musical ambitions; she bought him an accordion and, when he was ten years old, sent him to music school in Salvador which he attended for four years. As an accordionist, Gil first played classical music, but grew more interested in the folk and popular music of Brazil. He was particularly influenced by singer and accordion player Luiz Gonzaga; he began to sing and play the accordion in an emulation of Gonzaga's recordings. Gil has noted that he grew to identify with Gonzaga \"because he sang about the world around [him], the world that [he] encountered\".\n\nDuring his years in Salvador, Gil encountered the music of songwriter Dorival Caymmi, who he says represented to him the \"beach-oriented\" samba music of Salvador. Gonzaga and Caymmi were Gil's formative influences. While in Salvador, Gil was introduced to many other styles of music, including American big band jazz and tango. In 1950 Gil moved back to Salvador with his family. It was there, while in high school, that he joined his first band, Os Desafinados (\"The Out of Tunes\"), in which he played accordion and vibraphone and sang. Os Desafinados was influenced by American rock and roll musicians like Elvis Presley, as well as singing groups from Rio de Janeiro. The band was active for two to three years. Soon afterwards, inspired by Brazilian musician João Gilberto, he settled on the guitar as his primary instrument and began to play bossa nova.\n\nGil met guitarist and singer Caetano Veloso at the Universidade Federal da Bahia (Federal University of Bahia) in 1963. The two began collaborating and performing together, releasing a single and EP. Along with Maria Bethânia (Veloso's sister), Gal Costa, and Tom Zé, Gil and Veloso performed bossa nova and traditional Brazilian songs at the Vila Velha Theatre's opening night in July 1964, a show entitled \"Nós, por Exemplo\" (\"Us, for Example\"). Gil and the group continued to perform at the venue and he eventually became a musical director of the concert series. Gil collaborated again with members of this collective on the landmark 1968 album \"\", whose style was influenced by The Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", an album Gil listened to constantly. Gil describes \"Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses\" as the birth of the tropicália movement. As Gil describes it, tropicália, or tropicalismo, was a conflation of musical and cultural developments that had occurred in Brazil during the 1950s and 1960s—primarily bossa nova and the Jovem Guarda (\"Young Wave\") collective—with rock and roll music from the United States and Europe, a movement deemed threatening by the Brazilian government of the time.\n\nEarly on in the 1960s, Gil earned income primarily from selling bananas in a shopping mall and composing jingles for television advertisements; he was also briefly employed by the Brazilian division of Unilever, Gessy-Lever. He moved to São Paulo in 1965 and had a hit single when his song \"Louvação\" (which later appeared on the album of the same name) was released by Elis Regina. His first hit as a solo artist was the 1969 song \"Aquele Abraço\". Gil also performed in several television programs throughout the 1960s, which often included other \"tropicalistas\", members of the Tropicalismo movement. One of these programs, \"Divino Maravilhoso\", which featured Veloso, gained attention from government television censors after it aired a satirical version of the national anthem in December 1968.\n\nIn February 1969 Gil and Veloso were arrested by the Brazilian military government, brought from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro, and spent three months in prison and another four under house arrest, before being freed on the condition that they leave the country. Veloso was the first to be arrested; the police moved to Gil's home soon afterward. Veloso had directed his then-wife Andréa Gadelha to warn Gil about the possibility of arrest, but Gil was eventually brought into the police van along with Veloso. They were given no reason or charge for their arrest. Gil believes that the government felt his actions \"represent[ed] a threat [to them], something new, something that can't quite be understood, something that doesn't fit into any of the clear compartments of existing cultural practices, and that won't do. That is dangerous.\" During his prison sentence, Gil began to meditate, follow a macrobiotic diet, and read about Eastern philosophy. He composed four songs during his imprisonment, among them \"Cérebro Electrônico\" (\"Electronic Brain\"), which first appeared on his 1969 album \"Gilberto Gil 1969\", and later on his 2006 album \"Gil Luminoso\". Thereafter, Gil and Veloso were exiled to London, England after being offered to leave Brazil. The two played a last Brazilian concert together in Salvador in July 1969, and travelled to Portugal, Paris, and London. He and Veloso took a house in Chelsea, sharing their wives with their manager in it. Gil was involved in the organisation of the 1971 Glastonbury Free Festival and was exposed to reggae while living in London; he recalls listening to Bob Marley (whose songs he later covered), Jimmy Cliff, and Burning Spear. He was heavily influenced by and involved with the city's rock scene as well, performing with Yes, Pink Floyd, and the Incredible String Band. However, he also performed solo, recording \"Gilberto Gil\" (\"Nêga\") while in London. In addition to involvement in the reggae and rock scenes, Gil attended performances by jazz artists, including Miles Davis and Sun Ra.\nWhen he went back to Bahia in 1972, Gil focused on his musical career and environmental advocacy work. He released \"Expresso 2222\" the same year, from which two popular singles were released. Gil toured the United States and recorded an English-language album as well, continuing to release a steady stream of albums throughout the 1970s, including \"Realce\" and \"Refazenda.\" In the early 1970s Gil participated in a resurgence of the Afro-Brazilian afoxé tradition in Carnaval, joining the Filhos de Gandhi (\"Sons of Gandhi\") performance group, which only allowed black Brazilians to join. Gil also recorded a song titled \"Patuscada de Gandhi\" written about the Filhos de Gandhi that appeared on his 1977 album \"Refavela\". Greater attention was paid to afoxé groups in Carnaval because of the publicity that Gil had provided to them through his involvement; the groups increased in size as well. In the late 1970s he left Brazil for Africa and visited Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria. He also worked with Jimmy Cliff and released a cover of \"No Woman, No Cry\" with him in 1980, a number one hit that introduced reggae to Brazil.\n\nIn 1996, Gil contributed \"Refazenda\" to the AIDS-Benefit Album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization.\n\nIn 1998 the live version of his album \"Quanta\" won Gil the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album. In 2005 he won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album for \"Eletracústico\". In May 2005 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize by Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm, the prize's first Latin American recipient. On October 16 of the same year he received the Légion d'honneur from the government of France, coinciding with the Année du Brésil en France (\"Brazil's Year in France\").\n\nIn 2010 he released the album \"Fé Na Festa\", a record devoted to forró, a style of music from Brazil's northeast. His tour to promote this album received some negative feedback from fans who were expecting to hear a set featuring his hits. In 2013, Gilberto Gil plays his own role as a singer and promoter of cultural diversity in a long feature documentary shot around the southern hemisphere by Swiss filmmaker Pierre-Yves Borgeaud, \"Viramundo: a musical journey with Gilberto Gil\", distributed worldwide. The film also inaugurates the T.I.D.E. experiment for pan-European and multi-support releases.\n\nGil describes his attitude towards politics thus: \"I'd rather see my position in the government as that of an administrator or manager. But politics is a necessary ingredient.\" His political career began in 1987, when he was elected to a local post in Bahia and became the Salvador secretary of culture. In 1988, he was elected to the city council and subsequently became city commissioner for environmental protection. However, he left the office after one term and declined to run for the National Congress of Brazil. In 1990, Gil left the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and joined the Green Party. During this period, Gil founded the environmental protection organization Onda Azul (\"Blue Wave\"), which worked to protect Brazilian waters. He maintained a full-time musical career at the same time, and withdrew temporarily from politics in 1992, following the release \"Parabolicamará\", considered to be one of his most successful efforts. On October 16, 2001 Gil accepted his nomination to be a Goodwill Ambassador for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, having promoted the organization before his appointment.\n\nWhen President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in January 2003, he chose Gil as Brazil's new Minister of Culture, the second black person to serve in the country's cabinet. The appointment was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism. Gil had not been a member of Lula's Workers' Party and had not participated in creating its cultural program. Shortly after becoming Minister, Gil began a partnership between Brazil and Creative Commons. As Minister, he sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gave grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities. Gil asserted that \"You've now got young people who are becoming designers, who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods. It's a different vision of the role of government, a new role.\" Gil also expressed interest in a program to establish an Internet repository of freely downloadable Brazilian music. Following Gil's appointment, the department's expenditures increased by over 50 percent. In November 2007 Gil announced his intention to resign from his post due to a vocal cord polyp. Lula rejected Gil's first two attempts to resign, but accepted a further request in July 2008. Lula said on this occasion that Gil was \"going back to being a great artist, going back to giving priority to what is most important\" to him.\n\nGil has been married four times. His fourth wife is Flora Nair Giordano Gil Moreira. The couple has five children, four of whom are still living. The fifth child – Pedro Gil, Egotrip's drummer – died in a car accident in 1990. Preta Gil, an actress and singer, is his daughter.\n\nGil's religious beliefs have changed significantly over his lifetime. Originally, he was a Christian, but was later influenced by Eastern philosophy and religion, and, later, explored African spirituality. He is an agnostic. He practices yoga and is a vegetarian.\n\nGil has been open about the fact that he has smoked marijuana for much of his life. He has said he believes \"that drugs should be treated like pharmaceuticals, legalized, although under the same regulations and monitoring as medicines\".\n\nGil is a tenor, but he sings in the baritone or falsetto register, with lyrics and/or scat syllables. His lyrics are on subjects that range from philosophy to religion, folktales, and word play. Gil's musical style incorporates a broad range of influences. The first music he was exposed to included The Beatles and street performers in various metropolitan areas of Bahia. During his first years as a musician, Gil performed primarily in a blend of traditional Brazilian styles with two-step rhythms, such as baião and samba. He states that \"My first phase was one of traditional forms. Nothing experimental at all. Caetano [Veloso] and I followed in the tradition of Luiz Gonzaga and Jackson do Pandeiro, combining samba with northeastern music.\" American music critic Robert Christgau said that along with Jorge Ben, Gil was \"always ready to go further out on a beat than the other samba/bossa geniuses\".\n\nAs one of the pioneers of tropicália, influences from genres such as rock and punk have been pervasive in his recordings, as they have been in those of other stars of the period, including Caetano Veloso and Tom Zé. Gil's interest in the blues-based music of rock pioneer Jimi Hendrix, in particular, has been described by Veloso as having \"extremely important consequences for Brazilian music\". Veloso also noted the influence of Brazilian guitarist and singer Jorge Ben on Gil's musical style, coupled with that of traditional music. After the height of tropicália in the 1960s, Gil became increasingly interested in black culture, particularly in the Jamaican musical genre of reggae. He described the genre as \"a form of democratizing, internationalizing, speaking a new language, a Heideggerian form of passing along fundamental messages\".\n\nVisiting Lagos, Nigeria, in 1976 for the Festival of African Culture (FESTAC), Gil met fellow musicians Fela Kuti and Stevie Wonder. He became inspired by African music and later integrated some of the styles he had heard in Africa, such as juju and highlife, into his own recordings. One of the most famous of these African-influenced records was the 1977 album \"Refavela\", which included \"No Norte da Saudade\" (\"To the North of Sadness\"), a song heavily influenced by reggae. When Gil returned to Brazil after the visit, he focused on Afro-Brazilian culture, becoming a member of the Carnaval afoxé group Filhos de Gandhi.\n\nConversely, his 1980s musical repertoire presented an increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, as well as the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album \"Acoustic\" was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.\n\n\n\nPerrone, Charles A. \"Masters of Contemporary Brazilian Song: MPB 1965–1985\".

{"id": "42120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42120", "title": "Haile Selassie", "text": "Haile Selassie\n\nHaile Selassie I (, \"qädamawi haylä səllasé\", born Lij Tafari Makonnen; ; was Ethiopian regent from 1916 to 1930 and emperor from 1930 to 1974. He is a defining figure in Ethiopian history.\n\nHe was a member of the Solomonic Dynasty who traced his lineage to Emperor Menelik I via his Shewan royal ancestors as a great-grandson of king Sahle Selassie. Haile Selassie's father was Makonnen Wolde-Mikael Gudessa (መኮንን ወልደሚካኤል ጉዴሳ) and his mother was Yeshimebet Ali Aba Jifar (የሺመቤት አሊ አባ ጅፋር).\n\nHis internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations, and his political thought and experience in promoting multilateralism and collective security have proved seminal and enduring. At the League of Nations in 1936, the emperor condemned the use of chemical weapons by Italy against his people during the Second Italo–Ethiopian War. \n\nHis suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy (the \"mesafint\"), which consistently opposed his reforms, as well as what some critics perceived to be Ethiopia's failure to modernize rapidly enough, earned him criticism among some contemporaries and historians. During his rule the Harari people were ethnically cleansed from the Harari Region. His regime was also criticized by human rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch, as autocratic and illiberal.\n\nAmong the Rastafari movement, whose followers are estimated to number between 700,000 and one million, Haile Selassie is revered as the returned messiah of the Bible, God incarnate. Beginning in Jamaica in the 1930s, the Rastafari movement perceives Haile Selassie as a messianic figure who will lead a future golden age of eternal peace, righteousness, and prosperity. Haile Selassie was an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian throughout his life. \n\nThe 1973 famine in Ethiopia led to Haile Selassie's eventual removal from the throne. He died on 27 August 1975 at the age of 83, following a coup d'état.\n\nHaile Selassie was known as a child as Lij Tafari Makonnen (Amharic ; \"lij teferī mekōnnin\"). \"Lij\" is translated as \"child\", and serves to indicate that a youth is of noble blood. His given name, \"Tafari\", means \"one who is respected or feared\". Like most Ethiopians, his personal name Tafari is followed by that of his father Makonnen and rarely that of his grandfather Woldemikael. His Ge'ez name Haile Selassie was given to him at his infant baptism and adopted again as part of his regnal name in 1930.\n\nAs Governor of Harar, he became known as Ras Tafari Makonnen . \"Ras\" is translated as \"head\" and is a rank of nobility equivalent to \"Duke\"; though it is often rendered in translation as \"prince\". In 1916, Empress Zewditu I appointed him to the position of \"Balemulu Silt'an Enderase\" (Regent Plenipotentiary). In 1928, she granted him the throne of Shewa, elevating his title to \"Negus\" or \"King\".\n\nOn 2 November 1930, after the death of Empress Zewditu, Tafari was crowned \"Negusa Nagast\", literally King of Kings, rendered in English as \"Emperor\". Upon his ascension, he took as his regnal name Haile Selassie I. \"Haile\" means in Ge'ez \"Power of\" and \"Selassie\" means trinity—therefore \"Haile Selassie\" roughly translates to \"Power of the Trinity\". Haile Selassie's full title in office was \"By the Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, King of Kings of Ethiopia, Elect of God\". This title reflects Ethiopian dynastic traditions, which hold that all monarchs must trace their lineage to Menelik I, who was the offspring of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.\n\nTo Ethiopians, Haile Selassie has been known by many names, including Janhoy, Talaqu Meri, and Abba Tekel. The Rastafari movement employs many of these appellations, also referring to him as Jah, Jah Jah, Jah Rastafari, and HIM (the abbreviation of \"His Imperial Majesty\").\n\nHaile Selassie's royal line (through his father's mother) descended from Sahle Selassie, He was born on 23 July 1892, in the village of Ejersa Goro, in the Harar province of Ethiopia. His mother was Woizero (\"Lady\") Yeshimebet Ali Abba Jifar, daughter of the renowned Oromo ruler of Wollo province Dejazmach Ali Abba Jifar. His maternal grandmother was of Gurage heritage. Tafari's father was Ras Makonnen Woldemikael Gudessa, the governor of Harar. Ras Makonnen served as a general in the First Italo–Ethiopian War, playing a key role at the Battle of Adwa; he too was paternally Oromo but maternally Amhara. Haile Selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother, Woizero Tenagnework Sahle Selassie, who was an aunt of Emperor Menelik II and daughter of Negus Sahle Selassie of Shewa. As such, Haile Selassie claimed direct descent from Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, and King Solomon of ancient Israel.\n\nRas Makonnen arranged for Tafari as well as his first cousin, Imru Haile Selassie, to receive instruction in Harar from Abba Samuel Wolde Kahin, an Ethiopian capuchin monk, and from Dr. Vitalien, a surgeon from Guadeloupe. Tafari was named Dejazmach (literally \"commander of the gate\", roughly equivalent to \"count\") at the age of 13, on 1 November 1905. Shortly thereafter, his father Ras Makonnen died at Kulibi, in 1906.\n\nTafari assumed the titular governorship of Selale in 1906, a realm of marginal importance, but one that enabled him to continue his studies. In 1907, he was appointed governor over part of the province of Sidamo. It is alleged that during his late teens, Haile Selassie was married to \"Woizero\" Altayech, and that from this union, his daughter Princess Romanework was born.\n\nFollowing the death of his brother Yelma in 1907, the governorate of Harar was left vacant, and its administration was left to Menelik's loyal general, \"Dejazmach\" Balcha Safo. Balcha Safo's administration of Harar was ineffective, and so during the last illness of Menelik II, and the brief reign of Empress Taitu Bitul, Tafari was made governor of Harar in 1910 or 1911.\n\nOn 3 August, he married Menen Asfaw of Ambassel, niece of the heir to the throne Lij Iyasu.\n\nThe extent to which Tafari Makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose Iyasu V has been discussed extensively, particularly in Haile Selassie's own detailed account of the matter. Iyasu V, or Lij Iyasu, was the designated but uncrowned emperor of Ethiopia from 1913 to 1916. Iyasu's reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather, Menelik II, damaged his reputation. Iyasu's flirtation with Islam was considered treasonous among the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian leadership of the empire. On 27 September 1916, Iyasu was deposed.\n\nContributing to the movement that deposed Iyasu were conservatives such as \"Fitawrari\" Habte Giyorgis, Menelik II's longtime Minister of War. The movement to depose Iyasu preferred Tafari, as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions. Ultimately, Iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to Islam. In his place, the daughter of Menelik II (the aunt of Iyasu) was named Empress Zewditu, while Tafari was elevated to the rank of \"Ras\" and was made heir apparent and Crown Prince. In the power arrangement that followed, Tafari accepted the role of Regent Plenipotentiary (\"Balemulu 'Inderase\") and became the \"de facto\" ruler of the Ethiopian Empire (\"Mangista Ityop'p'ya\"). Zewditu would govern while Tafari would administer.\nWhile Iyasu had been deposed on 27 September 1916, on 8 October he managed to escape into the Ogaden Desert and his father, \"Negus\" Mikael of Wollo, had time to come to his aid. On 27 October, \"Negus\" Mikael and his army met an army under \"Fitawrari\" Habte Giyorgis loyal to Zewditu and Tafari. During the Battle of Segale, \"Negus\" Mikael was defeated and captured. Any chance that Iyasu would regain the throne was ended and he went into hiding. On 11 January 1921, after avoiding capture for about five years, Iyasu was taken into custody by Gugsa Araya Selassie.\n\nOn 11 February 1917, the coronation for Zewditu took place. She pledged to rule justly through her Regent, Tafari. While Tafari was the more visible of the two, Zewditu was far from an honorary ruler. Her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions. In other words, she had the last word. Tafari carried the burden of daily administration but, because his position was relatively weak, this was often an exercise in futility for him. Initially his personal army was poorly equipped, his finances were limited, and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the Empress, the Minister of War, or the provincial governors.\n\nDuring his Regency, the new Crown Prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by Menelik II. Also, during this time, he survived the 1918 flu pandemic, having come down with the illness. He secured Ethiopia's admission to the League of Nations in 1923 by promising to eradicate slavery; each emperor since Tewodros II had issued proclamations to halt slavery, but without effect: the internationally scorned practice persisted well into Haile Selassie's reign with an estimated 2 million slaves in Ethiopia in the early 1930s.\n\nIn 1924, \"Ras\" Tafari toured Europe and the Middle East visiting Jerusalem, Alexandria, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, London, Geneva, and Athens. With him on his tour was a group that included \"Ras\" Seyum Mangasha of western Tigray Province; \"Ras\" Hailu Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam province; \"Ras\" Mulugeta Yeggazu of Illubabor Province; \"Ras\" Makonnen Endelkachew; and \"Blattengeta\" Heruy Welde Sellase. The primary goal of the trip to Europe was for Ethiopia to gain access to the sea. In Paris, Tafari was to find out from the French Foreign Ministry (\"Quai d'Orsay\") that this goal would not be realized. However, failing this, he and his retinue inspected schools, hospitals, factories, and churches. Although patterning many reforms after European models, Tafari remained wary of European pressure. To guard against economic imperialism, Tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership. Of his modernization campaign, he remarked, \"We need European progress only because we are surrounded by it. That is at once a benefit and a misfortune.\"\n\nThroughout Tafari's travels in Europe, the Levant, and Egypt, he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination. He was accompanied by Seyum Mangasha and Hailu Tekle Haymanot who, like Tafari, were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against Italy a quarter-century earlier at the Battle of Adwa. Another member of his entourage, Mulugeta Yeggazu, actually fought at Adwa as a young man. The \"Oriental Dignity\" of the Ethiopians and their \"rich, picturesque court dress\" were sensationalized in the media; among his entourage he even included a pride of lions, which he distributed as gifts to President Alexandre Millerand and Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré of France, to King George V of the United Kingdom, and to the Zoological Garden (\"Jardin Zoologique\") of Paris. As one historian noted, \"Rarely can a tour have inspired so many anecdotes\". In return for two lions, the United Kingdom presented Tafari with the imperial crown of Emperor Tewodros II for its safe return to Empress Zewditu. The crown had been taken by Robert Napier during the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia.\n\nIn this period, the Crown Prince visited the Armenian monastery of Jerusalem. There, he adopted 40 Armenian orphans (አርባ ልጆች \"Arba Lijoch\", \"forty children\"), who had lost their parents in Ottoman massacres. Tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths, and they came to form the imperial brass band.\n\nTafari's authority was challenged in 1928 when \"Dejazmatch\" Balcha Safo went to Addis Ababa with a sizeable armed force. When Tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces, many of Menelik's appointees refused to abide by the new regulations. Balcha Safo, the governor (\"Shum\") of coffee-rich Sidamo Province, was particularly troublesome. The revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and Tafari recalled him to Addis Ababa. The old man came in high dudgeon and, insultingly, with a large army. The \"Dejazmatch\" paid homage to Empress Zewditu, but snubbed Tafari. On 18 February, while Balcha Safo and his personal bodyguard were in Addis Ababa, Tafari had \"Ras\" Kassa Haile Darge buy off his army and arranged to have him displaced as the \"Shum\" of Sidamo Province by Birru Wolde Gabriel who himself was replaced by Desta Damtew.\n\nEven so, the gesture of Balcha Safo empowered Empress Zewditu politically and she attempted to have Tafari tried for treason. He was tried for his benevolent dealings with Italy including a 20-year peace accord which was signed on 2 August. In September, a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the empress, made a final bid to get rid of Tafari. The attempted \"coup d'état\" was tragic in its origins and comic in its end. When confronted by Tafari and a company of his troops, the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in Menelik's mausoleum. Tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of Zewditu. More of Tafari's khaki clad soldiers arrived and, with superiority of arms, decided the outcome in his favor. Popular support, as well as the support of the police, remained with Tafari. Ultimately, the Empress relented and, on 7 October 1928, she crowned Tafari as \"Negus\" (Amharic: \"King\").\n\nThe crowning of Tafari as King was controversial. He occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire. Two monarchs, even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor (in this case empress), had never occupied the same location as their seat in Ethiopian history. Conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the dignity of the crown, leading to the rebellion of \"Ras\" Gugsa Welle. Gugsa Welle was the husband of the empress and the \"Shum\" of Begemder Province. In early 1930, he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at Gondar towards Addis Ababa. On 31 March 1930, Gugsa Welle was met by forces loyal to \"Negus\" Tafari and was defeated at the Battle of Anchem. Gugsa Welle was killed in action. News of Gugsa Welle's defeat and death had hardly spread through Addis Ababa when the empress died suddenly on 2 April 1930. Although it was long rumored that the empress was poisoned upon the defeat of her husband, or alternately that she died from shock upon hearing of the death of her estranged yet beloved husband, it has since been documented that the Empress succumbed to a flu-like fever and complications from diabetes.\n\nWith the passing of Zewditu, Tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed \"Neguse Negest ze-'Ityopp'ya\", \"King of Kings of Ethiopia\". He was crowned on 2 November 1930, at Addis Ababa's Cathedral of St. George. The coronation was by all accounts \"a most splendid affair\", and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world. Among those in attendance were George V's son the Duke of Gloucester, Marshal Franchet d'Esperey of France, and the Prince of Udine representing the King of Italy. Emissaries from the United States, Egypt, Turkey, Sweden, Belgium, and Japan were also present. British author Evelyn Waugh was also present, penning a contemporary report on the event, and American travel lecturer Burton Holmes shot the only known film footage of the event. One newspaper report suggested that the celebration may have incurred a cost in excess of $3,000,000. Many of those in attendance received lavish gifts; in one instance, the Christian emperor even sent a gold-encased Bible to an American bishop who had not attended the coronation, but who had dedicated a prayer to the emperor on the day of the coronation.\n\nHaile Selassie introduced Ethiopia's first written constitution on 16 July 1931, providing for a bicameral legislature. The constitution kept power in the hands of the nobility, but it did establish democratic standards among the nobility, envisaging a transition to democratic rule: it would prevail \"until the people are in a position to elect themselves.\" The constitution limited the succession to the throne to the descendants of Haile Selassie, a point that met with the disapprobation of other dynastic princes, including the princes of Tigrai and even the emperor's loyal cousin, Ras Kassa Haile Darge.\n\nIn 1932, the Sultanate of Jimma was formally absorbed into Ethiopia following the death of Sultan Abba Jifar II of Jimma.\n\nEthiopia became the target of renewed Italian imperialist designs in the 1930s. Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime was keen to avenge the military defeats Italy had suffered to Ethiopia in the First Italo-Abyssinian War, and to efface the failed attempt by \"liberal\" Italy to conquer the country, as epitomised by the defeat at Adwa. A conquest of Ethiopia could also empower the cause of fascism and embolden its rhetoric of empire. Ethiopia would also provide a bridge between Italy's Eritrean and Italian Somaliland possessions. Ethiopia's position in the League of Nations did not dissuade the Italians from invading in 1935; the \"collective security\" envisaged by the League proved useless, and a scandal erupted when the Hoare-Laval Pact revealed that Ethiopia's League allies were scheming to appease Italy.\n\nFollowing the 5 December 1934 Italian invasion of Ethiopia at Welwel, Ogaden Province, Haile Selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at Desse in Wollo province. He issued his mobilization order on 3 October 1935:\nOn 19 October 1935, Haile Selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his Commander-in-Chief, Ras Kassa:\nCompared to the Ethiopians, the Italians had an advanced, modern military which included a large air force. The Italians would also come to employ chemical weapons extensively throughout the conflict, even targeting Red Cross field hospitals in violation of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nStarting in early October 1935, the Italians invaded Ethiopia. But, by November, the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and Haile Selassie's northern armies were able to launch what was known as the \"Christmas Offensive\". During this offensive, the Italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive. In early 1936, the First Battle of Tembien stopped the progress of the Ethiopian offensive and the Italians were ready to continue their offensive. Following the defeat and destruction of the northern Ethiopian armies at the Battle of Amba Aradam, the Second Battle of Tembien, and the Battle of Shire, Haile Selassie took the field with the last Ethiopian army on the northern front. On 31 March 1936, he launched a counterattack against the Italians himself at the Battle of Maychew in southern Tigray. The emperor's army was defeated and retreated in disarray. As Haile Selassie's army withdrew, the Italians attacked from the air along with rebellious Raya and Azebo tribesmen on the ground, who were armed and paid by the Italians.\n\nHaile Selassie made a solitary pilgrimage to the churches at Lalibela, at considerable risk of capture, before returning to his capital. After a stormy session of the council of state, it was agreed that because Addis Ababa could not be defended, the government would relocate to the southern town of Gore, and that in the interest of preserving the Imperial house, the emperor's wife Menen Asfaw and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for French Somaliland, and from there continue on to Jerusalem.\n\nAfter further debate as to whether Haile Selassie should go to Gore or accompany his family into exile, it was agreed that he should leave Ethiopia with his family and present the case of Ethiopia to the League of Nations at Geneva. The decision was not unanimous and several participants, including the nobleman Blatta Tekle Wolde Hawariat, strenuously objected to the idea of an Ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force. Haile Selassie appointed his cousin Ras Imru Haile Selassie as Prince Regent in his absence, departing with his family for French Somaliland on 2 May 1936.\n\nOn 5 May, Marshal Pietro Badoglio led Italian troops into Addis Ababa, and Mussolini declared Ethiopia an Italian province. Victor Emanuel III was proclaimed as the new Emperor of Ethiopia. On the previous day, the Ethiopian exiles had left French Somaliland aboard the British cruiser HMS \"Enterprise\". They were bound for Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine, where the Ethiopian royal family maintained a residence. The Imperial family disembarked at Haifa and then went on to Jerusalem. Once there, Haile Selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at Geneva. The choice of Jerusalem was highly symbolic, since the Solomonic Dynasty claimed descent from the House of David. Leaving the Holy Land, Haile Selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the British cruiser HMS \"Capetown\" for Gibraltar, where he stayed at the Rock Hotel. From Gibraltar, the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner. By doing this, the government of the United Kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception.\n\nMussolini, upon invading Ethiopia, had promptly declared his own \"Italian Empire.\" Because the League of Nations afforded Haile Selassie the opportunity to address the assembly, Italy even withdrew its League delegation, on 12 May 1936. It was in this context that Haile Selassie walked into the hall of the League of Nations, introduced by the President of the Assembly as \"His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Ethiopia\" (\"Sa Majesté Imperiale, l'Empereur d'Ethiopie\"). The introduction caused a great many Italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering, heckling, and whistling. As it turned out, they had earlier been issued whistles by Mussolini's son-in-law, Count Galeazzo Ciano. The Romanian delegate, Nicolae Titulescu, famously jumped to his feet in response and cried \"To the door with the savages!\", and the offending journalists were removed from the hall. Haile Selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared, and responded \"majestically\" with a speech sometimes considered among the most stirring of the 20th century.\n\nAlthough fluent in French, the working language of the League, Haile Selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native Amharic. He asserted that, because his \"confidence in the League was absolute\", his people were now being slaughtered. He pointed out that the same European states that found in Ethiopia's favor at the League of Nations were refusing Ethiopia credit and matériel while aiding Italy, which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike.\nNoting that his own \"small people of 12 million inhabitants, without arms, without resources\" could never withstand an attack by a large power such as Italy, with its 42 million people and \"unlimited quantities of the most death-dealing weapons\", he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression, and that all small states were in effect reduced to vassal states in the absence of collective action. He admonished the League that \"God and history will remember your judgment.\"\nThe speech made the emperor an icon for anti-fascists around the world, and \"Time\" named him \"Man of the Year\". He failed, however, to get what he most needed: the League agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on Italy. Only six nations in 1937 did not recognize Italy's occupation: China, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, the Republic of Spain, Mexico and the United States.\n\nHaile Selassie spent his exile years (1936–41) in Bath, England, in Fairfield House, which he bought. The emperor and Kassa Haile Darge took morning walks together behind the high walls of the 14-room Georgian house. Haile Selassie's favorite reading was \"diplomatic history.\" But most of his serious hours were occupied with the 90,000-word story of his life that he was laboriously writing in Amharic.\n\nPrior to Fairfield House, he briefly stayed at Warne's Hotel in Worthing and in Parkside, Wimbledon. A bust of Haile Selassie is in nearby Cannizaro Park to commemorate this time and is a popular place of pilgrimage for London's Rastafari community. Haile Selassie stayed at the Abbey Hotel in Malvern in the 1930s and his granddaughters and daughters of court officials were educated at Clarendon School in North Malvern. During his time in Malvern he attended services at Holy Trinity Church, in Link Top. A blue plaque, commemorating his stay in Malvern, was unveiled on Saturday, 25 June 2011. As part of the ceremony, a delegation from the Rastafari movement gave a short address and a drum recital.\n\nHaile Selassie's activity in this period was focused on countering Italian propaganda as to the state of Ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation. He spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts (including the theft of a 1,600-year-old imperial obelisk), and condemned the atrocities suffered by the Ethiopian civilian population. He continued to plead for League intervention and to voice his certainty that \"God's judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike\", though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against Italy were largely unsuccessful until Italy entered World War II on the German side in June 1940.\n\nThe emperor's pleas for international support did take root in the United States, particularly among African-American organizations sympathetic to the Ethiopian cause. In 1937, Haile Selassie was to give a Christmas Day radio address to the American people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident, leaving him with a fractured knee. Rather than canceling the radio broadcast, he proceeded in much pain to complete the address, in which he linked Christianity and goodwill with the Covenant of the League of Nations, and asserted that \"War is not the only means to stop war\":\nDuring this period, Haile Selassie suffered several personal tragedies. His two sons-in-law, Ras Desta Damtew and Dejazmach Beyene Merid, were both executed by the Italians. The emperor's daughter, Princess Romanework, wife of Dejazmach Beyene Merid, was herself taken into captivity with her children, and she died in Italy in 1941. His daughter Tsehai died during childbirth shortly after the restoration in 1942.\n\nAfter his return to Ethiopia, he donated Fairfield House to the city of Bath as a residence for the aged, until modified in the 1990s to be used as a day care centre. Advanced negotiations are now proceeding for a community group to run the House to preserve and develop it.\n\nBritish forces, which consisted primarily of Ethiopian-backed African and South African colonial troops under the \"Gideon Force\" of Colonel Orde Wingate, coordinated the military effort to liberate Ethiopia. The emperor himself issued several imperial proclamations in this period, demonstrating that, while authority was not divided up in any formal way, British military might and the emperor's populist appeal could be joined in the concerted effort to liberate Ethiopia.\n\nOn 18 January 1941, during the East African Campaign, Haile Selassie crossed the border between Sudan and Ethiopia near the village of Um Iddla. The standard of the Lion of Judah was raised again. Two days later, he and a force of Ethiopian patriots joined Gideon Force which was already in Ethiopia and preparing the way. Italy was defeated by a force of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Nations, Free France, Free Belgium, and Ethiopian patriots. On 5 May 1941, Haile Selassie entered Addis Ababa and personally addressed the Ethiopian people, five years to the day since his 1936 exile:\nOn 27 August 1942, Haile Selassie confirmed the legal basis for the abolition of slavery that had been enacted by Italy throughout the empire and imposed severe penalties, including death, for slave trading. After World War II, Ethiopia became a charter member of the United Nations. In 1948, the Ogaden, a region disputed with Somalia, was granted to Ethiopia. On 2 December 1950, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 390 (V), establishing the federation of Eritrea (the former Italian colony) into Ethiopia. Eritrea was to have its own constitution, which would provide for ethnic, linguistic, and cultural balance, while Ethiopia was to manage its finances, defense, and foreign policy.\n\nDespite his centralization policies that had been made before World War II, Haile Selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted. In 1942, he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme, but this failed due to opposition from the nobility, and only a flat tax was passed; in 1951, he agreed to reduce this as well. Ethiopia was still \"semi-feudal\", and the emperor's attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy, which were eager to resume their privileges in the postwar era. Where Haile Selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes, the burdens were often passed by the landowners to the peasants. Despite his wishes, the tax burden remained primarily on the peasants.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1959, Haile Selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church had been headed by the \"abuna\", a bishop who answered to the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In 1942 and 1945 Haile Selassie applied to the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church to establish the independence of Ethiopian bishops, and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the Coptic Church of Alexandria. Finally, in 1959, Pope Kyrillos VI elevated the Abuna to Patriarch-Catholicos. The Ethiopian Church remained affiliated with the Alexandrian Church. In addition to these efforts, Haile Selassie changed the Ethiopian church-state relationship by introducing taxation of church lands, and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy, who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses.\n\nIn keeping with the principle of collective security, for which he was an outspoken proponent, he sent a contingent under General Mulugueta Bulli, known as the Kagnew Battalion, to take part in the Korean War by supporting the United Nations Command. It was attached to the American 7th Infantry Division, and fought in a number of engagements including the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. In a 1954 speech, the emperor spoke of Ethiopian participation in the Korean War as a redemption of the principles of collective security:\n\nDuring the celebrations of his Silver Jubilee in November 1955, Haile Selassie introduced a revised constitution, whereby he retained effective power, while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body. Party politics were not provided for. Modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the Empire, and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization, tempered by Ethiopian traditions, and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state.\n\nHaile Selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church. He also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups, and granted autonomy to Afar lands that were difficult to control. Still, his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy. The Revised Constitution of 1955 has been criticized for reasserting \"the indisputable power of the monarch\" and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants.\n\nHaile Selassie also maintained cordial relations with the government of the United Kingdom through charitable gestures. He sent aid to the British government in 1947 when Britain was affected by heavy flooding. His letter to Lord Meork, National Distress Fund, London said, \"even though We are busy of helping our people who didn't recover from the crises of the war, We heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by the unusually heavy rain, and your request for aid. Therefore, We are sending small amount of money, about one thousand pounds through our embassy to show our sympathy and cooperation.\" He also left his home in exile, Fairfield House, Bath, to the City of Bath for the use of the aged in 1959.\n\nHaile Selassie contributed Ethiopian troops to the United Nations Operation in the Congo peacekeeping force during the 1960 Congo Crisis, to preserve Congolese integrity, per United Nations Security Council Resolution 143. On 13 December 1960, while Haile Selassie was on a state visit to Brazil, his Imperial Guard forces staged an unsuccessful coup, briefly proclaiming Haile Selassie's eldest son Asfa Wossen as emperor. The coup d'état was crushed by the regular army and police forces. The coup attempt lacked broad popular support, was denounced by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and was unpopular with the army, air force and police. Nonetheless, the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes. The coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in Ethiopian history, the point at which Ethiopians \"for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the people's consent\". Student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor, and to advocate on their behalf. The coup spurred Haile Selassie to accelerate reform, which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials.\n\nThe emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the West, while pursuing a firm policy of decolonization in Africa, which was still largely under European colonial rule. The United Nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of Eritrea, with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the state's future. Britain, the administrator at the time, suggested the partition of Eritrea between Sudan and Ethiopia, separating Christians and Muslims. The idea was instantly rejected by Eritrean political parties, as well as the UN.\n\nA UN plebiscite voted 46 to 10 to have Eritrea be federated with Ethiopia, which was later stipulated on 2 December 1950 in resolution 390 (V). Eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the Ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament. Haile Selassie would have none of European attempts to draft a separate Constitution under which Eritrea would be governed, and wanted his own 1955 Constitution protecting families to apply in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 1961 the 30-year Eritrean Struggle for Independence began, followed by Haile Selassie's dissolution of the federation and shutting down of Eritrea's parliament.\n\nIn September 1961, Haile Selassie attended the Conference of Heads of State of Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade, FPR Yugoslavia. This is considered to be the founding conference of the Non-Aligned Movement.\n\nIn 1961, tensions between independence-minded Eritreans and Ethiopian forces culminated in the Eritrean War of Independence. The emperor declared Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962. The war would continue for 30 years, as first Haile Selassie, then the Soviet-backed junta that succeeded him, attempted to retain Eritrea by force.\n\nIn 1963, Haile Selassie presided over the formation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the precursor of the continent-wide African Union (AU). The new organization would establish its headquarters in Addis Ababa. In May of that year, Haile Selassie was elected as the OAU's first official chairperson, a rotating seat. Along with Modibo Keïta of Mali, the Ethiopian leader would later help successfully negotiate the Bamako Accords, which brought an end to the border conflict between Morocco and Algeria. In 1964, Haile Selassie would initiate the concept of the United States of Africa, a proposition later taken up by Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nOn 4 October 1963, Haile Selassie addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations referring in his address to his earlier speech to the League of Nations:\nOn 25 November 1963, the emperor was among other heads of state, including France's President Charles de Gaulle, who traveled to Washington D.C. and attended the funeral of assassinated President John F. Kennedy.\n\nIn 1966, Haile Selassie attempted to create a modern, progressive tax that included registration of land, which would significantly weaken the nobility. Even with alterations, this law led to a revolt in Gojjam, which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned. The revolt, having achieved its design in undermining the tax, encouraged other landowners to defy Haile Selassie.\nWhile he had fully approved and assured Ethiopia's participation in UN-approved collective security operations, including Korea and Congo, Haile Selassie drew a distinction between it and the non-UN-approved foreign intervention in Indochina, consistently deploring it as needless suffering and calling for the Vietnam War to end on several occasions. At the same time he remained open toward the United States and commended it for making progress with African Americans' Civil Rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s, while visiting the US several times during these years.\n\nIn 1967, he visited Montreal, Canada to open the Ethiopian Pavilion at the Expo '67 World's Fair where he received great acclaim amongst other World leaders there for the occasion.\n\nStudent unrest became a regular feature of Ethiopian life in the 1960s and 1970s. Marxism took root in large segments of the Ethiopian intelligentsia, particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and left-wing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe. Resistance by conservative elements at the Imperial Court and Parliament, and by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, made Haile Selassie's land reform proposals difficult to implement, and also damaged the standing of the government, costing Haile Selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed. This bred resentment among the peasant population. Efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image. As these issues began to pile up, Haile Selassie left much of domestic governance to his Prime Minister, Aklilu Habte Wold, and concentrated more on foreign affairs.\n\nOutside of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect. As the longest-serving head of state in power, he was often given precedence over other leaders at state events, such as the state funerals of John F. Kennedy and Charles de Gaulle, the summits of the Non-Aligned Movement, and the 1971 celebration of the 2,500 years of the Persian Empire. In 1970 he visited Italy as a guest of President Giuseppe Saragat, and in Milan he met Giordano Dell'Amore, President of Italian Savings Banks Association. He visited China in October 1971, and was the first foreign head of state to meet Mao Zedong following the death of Mao's designated successor Lin Biao in a plane crash in Mongolia.\n\nHuman rights in Ethiopia under Selassie's regime were poor. Civil liberties and political rights were low with Freedom House giving Ethiopia a \"Not Free\" score for both civil liberties and political rights in the last years of Selassie's rule. Common human right abuses included imprisonment and torture of political prisoners and very poor prison conditions. The Ethiopian army also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the Eritrean separatists. This was due to a policy of destroying Eritrean villages that supported the rebels. There were a number of mass killings of hundreds of civilians during the war in the late 1960s and early '70s.\n\nFamine—mostly in Wollo, north-eastern Ethiopia, as well as in some parts of Tigray—is estimated to have killed 40,000 to 80,000 Ethiopians between 1972 and 1974. A BBC News report has cited a 1973 estimate that 200,000 deaths occurred, based on a contemporaneous estimate from the Ethiopian Nutrition Institute. While this figure is still repeated in some texts and media sources, it was an estimate that was later found to be \"over-pessimistic\". Although the region is infamous for recurrent crop failures and continuous food shortage and starvation risk, this episode was remarkably severe. A 1973 production of the ITV programme \"The Unknown Famine\" by Jonathan Dimbleby relied on the unverified estimate of 200,000 dead, stimulating a massive influx of aid while at the same time destabilizing Haile Selassie's regime.\nSome reports suggest that the emperor was unaware of the extent of the famine, while others assert that he was well aware of it. In addition to the exposure of attempts by corrupt local officials to cover up the famine from the imperial government, the Kremlin's depiction of Haile Selassie's Ethiopia as backwards and inept (relative to the purported utopia of Marxism-Leninism) contributed to the popular uprising that led to its downfall and the rise of Mengistu Haile Mariam. The famine and its image in the media undermined popular support of the government, and Haile Selassie's once unassailable personal popularity fell.\n\nThe crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high oil prices, the latter a result of the 1973 oil crisis. The international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods, gasoline, and food to skyrocket, while unemployment spiked.\n\nIn February 1974, four days of serious riots in Addis Ababa against a sudden economic inflation left five dead. The emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities. This calmed the public, but the promised 33% military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army, which then mutinied, beginning in Asmara and spreading throughout the empire. This mutiny led to the resignation of Prime Minister Aklilu Habte-Wold on 27 February 1974. Haile Selassie again went on television to agree to the army's demands for still greater pay, and named Endelkachew Makonnen as his new Prime Minister. Despite Endalkatchew's many concessions, discontent continued in March with a four-day general strike that paralyzed the nation.\n\nThe Derg, a committee of low-ranking military officers and enlisted men, set up in June to investigate the military's demands, took advantage of the government's disarray to depose the 82-year-old Selassie on General Aman Mikael Andom, a Protestant of Eritrean origin, served briefly as provisional head of state pending the return of Crown Prince Asfa Wossen, who was then receiving medical treatment abroad. Selassie was placed under house arrest briefly at the 4th Army Division in Addis Ababa, while most of his family was detained at the late Duke of Harar's residence in the north of the capital. The last months of the emperor's life were spent in imprisonment, in the Grand Palace. Reportedly, his mental condition was such that he believed he was still Emperor of Ethiopia.\n\nLater, most of the imperial family was imprisoned in the Addis Ababa prison Kerchele, also known as \"Alem Bekagne,\" or \"I've had Enough of This World.\" On November 23, sixty former high officials of the imperial government were executed by firing squad without which included Selassie's grandson Iskinder Desta, a rear admiral, as well as General Andom and two former These killings, known to Ethiopians as \"Bloody Saturday,\" were condemned by Crown Prince Asfa Wossen; the Derg responded to his rebuke by revoking its acknowledgment of his imperial legitimacy, and announcing the end of the Solomonic dynasty.\n\nOn 28 August 1975, the state media reported that the \"ex-monarch\" Haile Selassie had died on 27 August of \"respiratory failure\" following complications from a prostate examination followed up by a prostate operation. His doctor, Asrat Woldeyes, denied that complications had occurred and rejected the government version of his death. In 1994, three years after the military socialist Derg regime was overthrown, an Ethiopian court found several former military officers guilty of cruelly strangling the emperor in his bed. Charging the suspected assailants with genocide and murder, the Ethiopian court claimed that it had obtained documents attesting to a high-level order from the military regime to assassinate Emperor Haile Selassie for leading a \"feudal regime\". Document sources showing the Derg's final assassination order, bearing the military regime's seal and signature, have been widely circulated online. The veracity of the content in these documents has been corroborated by multiple former members of the military Derg regime. \n\nThe Soviet-backed Derg fell in 1991. In 1992, the emperor's bones were found under a concrete slab on the palace grounds; some reports suggest that his remains were discovered beneath a latrine. For almost a decade thereafter, as Ethiopian courts attempted to sort out the circumstances of his death, his coffin rested in Bhata Church, near his great-uncle Menelik II's resting place. On 5 November 2000, Haile Selassie was given an imperial-style funeral by the Ethiopian Orthodox church. The post-communist government refused calls to declare the ceremony an official imperial funeral.\n\nAlthough such prominent Rastafari figures as Rita Marley and others participated in the grand funeral, most Rastafari rejected the event and refused to accept that the bones were the remains of Haile Selassie. There remains some debate within the Rastafari movement whether Haile Selassie actually died in 1975.\n\nBy Menen Asfaw, Haile Selassie had six children: Princess Tenagnework, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen, Princess Zenebework, Princess Tsehai, Prince Makonnen, and Prince Sahle Selassie.\n\nThere is some controversy as to the motherhood of Haile Selassie's eldest daughter, Princess Romanework. While the living members of the royal family state that Romanework is the eldest daughter of Empress Menen, it has been asserted that Princess Romanework is actually the daughter of a previous union of the emperor with Woizero Altayech. This may be a nickname she used, as nobleman Blata Merse Hazen Wolde Kirkos, a contemporary source prominent in both the Imperial Court and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church names her as Woizero Woinetu Amede. The emperor's own autobiography makes no mention of this previous marriage or having fathered children with anyone other than Empress Menen, although he mentions the death of this daughter in captivity at Turin. Other sources such as Blata Merse Hazen Wolde Kirkos mentions Princess Romanework's mother Woizero Woinetu Amede as attending the wedding of her daughter to Dejazmatch Beyene Merid in a first hand account in his book about the years before the Italian occupation.\n\nPrince Asfaw Wossen was first married to Princess Wolete Israel Seyoum and then following their divorce to Princess Medferiashwork Abebe. Prince Makonnen was married to Princess Sara Gizaw. Prince Sahle Selassie was married to Princess Mahisente Habte Mariam. Princess Romanework married Dejazmatch Beyene Merid. Princess Tenagnework first married Ras Desta Damtew, and after she was widowed later married Ras Andargachew Messai. Princess Zenebework married Dejazmatch Haile Selassie Gugsa. Princess Tsehai married Lt. General Abiye Abebe.\n\nToday, Haile Selassie is worshipped as God incarnate among followers of the Rastafari movement (taken from Haile Selassie's pre-imperial name \"Ras\"—meaning \"Head\", a title equivalent to Duke—Tafari Makonnen), which emerged in Jamaica during the 1930s under the influence of Leonard Howell, a follower of Marcus Garvey's \"Pan Africanism\" movement. He is viewed as the messiah who will lead the peoples of Africa and the African diaspora to freedom. His official titles are \"Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah\" and \"King of Kings of Ethiopia and Elect of God\", and his traditional lineage is thought to be from Solomon and Sheba. These notions are perceived by Rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic Book of Revelation in the New Testament: \"King of Kings\", \"Lord of Lords\", \"Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah,\" and \"Root of David\". Rastafari faith in the incarnate divinity of Haile Selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached Jamaica, particularly via the two \"Time\" magazine articles on the coronation the week before and the week after the event. Haile Selassie's own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement.\n\nIn 1961, the Jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both Rastafari and non-Rastafari leaders to Ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation, among other issues, with the emperor. He reportedly told the Rastafari delegation (which included Mortimer Planno), \"Tell the Brethren to be not dismayed, I personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation.\"\n\nHaile Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and approximately one hundred thousand Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston, having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them. Spliffs and chalices were openly smoked, causing \"a haze of ganja smoke\" to drift through the air. Haile Selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the mobile steps of the airplane, as the crowd rushed the tarmac. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally, Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the emperor's descent. Planno re-emerged and announced to the crowd: \"The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land\". This day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement, and it is still commemorated by Rastafari as Grounation Day, the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after 2 November, the emperor's Coronation Day.\n\nFrom then on, as a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor, and Rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor, where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica. This dictum came to be known as \"liberation before repatriation\".\n\nHaile Selassie defied expectations of the Jamaican authorities and never rebuked the Rastafari for their belief in him as the returned Jesus. Instead, he presented the movement's faithful elders with gold medallions – the only recipients of such an honor on this visit. During PNP leader (later Jamaican Prime Minister) Michael Manley's visit to Ethiopia in October 1969, the emperor allegedly still recalled his 1966 reception with amazement, and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs. This was the visit when Manley received the Rod of Correction or Rod of Joshua as a present from the emperor, which is thought to have helped him to win the 1972 election in Jamaica.\n\nRita Marley, Bob Marley's wife, converted to the Rastafari faith after seeing Haile Selassie on his Jamaican trip. She claimed in interviews (and in her book \"No Woman, No Cry\") that she saw a \"stigmata\" print on the palm of Haile Selassie's hand as he waved to the crowd which resembled the markings on Christ's hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources, but was used as evidence for her and other Rastafari to suggest that Haile Selassie I was indeed their messiah. She was also influential in the conversion of Bob Marley, who then became internationally recognized. As a result, Rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world. Bob Marley's posthumously released song \"Iron Lion Zion\" refers to Haile Selassie.\n\nIn a 1967 recorded interview Haile Selassie appeared to deny his alleged divinity. In the interview Bill McNeil says: \"there are millions of Christians throughout the world, your Imperial Majesty, who regard you as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ.\" Selassie replied in his native language:\nFor many Rastafari the CBC interview is not interpreted as a denial of his divinity, and according to Robert Earl Hood, Haile Selassie neither denied nor affirmed his divinity either way. In \"Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music\", Kevin Chang and Wayne Chen note:\nAfter his return to Ethiopia, he dispatched Archbishop Abuna Yesehaq Mandefro to the Caribbean to help draw Rastafari and other West Indians to the Ethiopian church and, according to some sources, denied his divinity.\n\nIn 1948, Haile Selassie donated a piece of land at Shashamane, 250 km south of Addis Ababa, for the use of people of African descent from the West Indies. Numerous Rastafari families settled there and still live as a community to this day.\n\n\n\nHaile Selassie held the following ranks:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1835 as 23rd in a class of 56 cadets. Posted in the 5th U.S. Infantry he resigned shortly after his graduation and worked as a civil engineer. Naglee came to California in 1846 during the Mexican–American War as captain of Company D of the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers. Leading a detachment of volunteers to La Paz in Baja California he fought in the Skirmish of Todos Santos where he led 45 mounted soldiers into the Mexican rear, which led to the collapse of their resistance. In the following pursuit he ordered the killing of two captured Mexicans without orders, for which the military governor of Alta California, Colonel Richard B. Mason, ordered Naglee arrested. When President Polk granted a pardon to military and naval offenders acting in wartime, Naglee escaped punishment for this crime.\n\nAfter his discharge from the army, in 1849, Captain Naglee became the first commanding officer of the 1st California Guards, a California Militia unit in San Francisco, the beginning of what would become the California National Guard. He also entered into a career in banking. In 1858 Naglee left San Francisco to study viticulture in Europe. Later that year, he bought 140 acres (0.570 km²) just east of downtown San Jose, California, where he built an estate and planted vineyards of Riesling and Charbono grapes, from which he distilled brandy. His high-quality brandy and his great viticultural knowledge made him famous as the \"Father of California's brandy industry\".\n\nIn May 1861 Naglee reentered the United States Army as lieutenant colonel of the 16th U.S. Infantry. As the regiment´s recruitment took longer and longer Naglee´s want for active service made him resign in January 1862. Naglee was made a brigadier general of Volunteers the next month and given command of a brigade in the IV Corps of the Army of the Potomac. on May 31 and June 1. The division, under command of Gen. Silas Casey, was made up of the greenest troops in the army. During the Peninsula Campaign he fought in the Battle of Fair Oaks on May 31. His brigade and the whole division distinguished themselves when they were attacked, but had to fall back in the end. Naglee himself had his horse killed under him and received four wounds from musket-balls. While both praise and blame were given to the division, and Naglee, he wrote a number of reports and letters, increasing his role in the battle, that sparked great criticism and animosity. Later that year he commanded a brigade and a division in North Carolina, participating in the relief of Washington. In 1863 he commanded the VII Corps and the District of Virginia. In 1864 he was mustered out of the army and returned to San Jose to resume banking and brandy making. He also actively campaigned in the election of General McClellan for the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 1865 he married 24 years old Marie Antoinette Ringgold, the daughter of his friend George Hays Ringgold and descendant to President James Monroe. From this marriage were born two daughters, Marie, in 1866, and Antoinette, in 1869. Mrs. Naglee died in 1869 and Naglee never remarried. In California General Naglee was involved in two very public scandals. In 1865, Mary Schell, whom Naglee had met in 1858 and corresponded with while at war, published his love letters in a book entitled \"The Love Life of Brigadier General Henry M. Naglee, Consisting of a correspondence on Love, War and Politics\", after he broke off their relationship. In 1877 his nanny Emily Hanks filed a lawsuit against Naglee, claiming he proposed marriage to her and then seduced her. This led to two trials and three years of headlines in the local newspapers. The court ruled in Hanks's favor in the first trial, but in Naglee's in the second.\n\nHenry Naglee died on illness in San Francisco on March 5, 1886, and is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. His estate was developed into the residential Naglee Park neighborhood in 1902 by his daughters. They erected a stone and brass memorial to Naglee in San Jose's St. James Park, and Naglee Avenue in San Jose was named after him.\n\n\n"}

He was Minister of Defense between the victory of the Sandinista revolution in 1979 under the National Reconstruction Government, through the first presidency of his brother Daniel Ortega Saavedra, and through the presidency of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro who defeated Daniel Ortega in the elections of 1990.\n\nHumberto Ortega, his brother, the current President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, and Victor Tirado López founded the Tercerista tendency of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1975. He, among others leaders, crafted the urban insurrection strategy that ignited civil war in Nicaragua in October 1977 which led to the fall of the Somoza dynastic dictatorship in July 1979. As Minister of Defense during the decade of Sandinista rule, Ortega oversaw the buildup of the Sandinista Popular Army (EPS) and the prosecution of the war against the \"contra\" resistance factions and their peasant support base.\n\nFollowing the electoral defeat of Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista Party in 1990, Humberto maintained control of the military. Later that year accusations arose against Humberto claiming his involvement in the murder and cover up of sixteen-year-old Jean Paul. Ortega's bodyguards allegedly shot and killed the young man when he attempted to pass the generals motorcade on October 28, 1990. In November of 1990 the Nicuraugan National Assembly along with experts from the Venisualan Ministry of Justice began an investigation of this incident. Most of the evidence found by the investigators proved to be circumstantial and the travel records for the motorcade were never found. Civil District Judge Boanerges Ojeda suggested Ortega's bodyguards, two officers, and Humberto be tried in court before he passed the case to the military prosecuters office where it was closed in July of 1992. He retired in 1995, turning the job over to his second in command, Joaquín Cuadra. General Humberto Ortega started transforming the EPS into the non-political Nicaraguan National Army. Allegedly, he was behind the assassination of many retired anti-sandinistas rebels. This allegation has not been put forward by any legal authority inside or outside of Nicaragua.\n\nIn December 2004 he released a book titled \"La Epopeya de la Insurrección\" (Epic of the Insurrection). Ortega says he worked 10 hours a day on the book for two years using his own records, meeting notes, archives and analytical schemes to reconstruct the history of the struggle that ultimately brought down the 43-year Somoza family dictatorship. Among his other books are, \"50 Años de Lucha Sandinista\", \"Sobre la Insurrección\" and \"Nicaragua Revolución y Democracia\".\n\n\nWebsite for the book.

Medek was an important voice of the Czech anti-communist opposition movement, particularly after being forced into exile from Czechoslovakia in 1978. Medek collaborated closely with such Czechoslovak politicians as Václav Havel and Pavel Tigrid in opposition to communist rule.\n\nMedek was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on July 13, 1925. He began his career as both a classical music critic and journalist. He worked as a musician for the Czech Philharmonic until he was fired by the government for his support of the opposition.\n\nMedek was an original signatory of the Charter 77 manifesto in 1977. Persecution by the communist government for his participation in Charter 77 forced Medek into exile in neighboring Austria beginning in 1978. Medek began working at the Voice of America in Austria, where he broadcast news and information into Czechoslovakia. His VoA radio broadcasts became an important link for anti-communist dissidents in his native Czechoslovakia.\n\nMedek returned to Czechoslovakia from exile in 1989 during the Velvet Revolution. In 1993, Medek was appointed to the office of the presidency under Václav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic. He later became the head of the presidency, or chancellor, under Havel.\n\nMedek died in Prague on January 6, 2010, at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife, Helena.\n"}

Drnovšek graduated from the University of Ljubljana with a degree in economics in 1973. \n\nMeanwhile, he worked as an intern at a Le Havre bank. In 1975, at the age of 25, he became chief financial officer at SGP Beton Zagorje, a construction company. Two years later he became, for one year, an economic adviser at the Yugoslav embassy in Cairo.\n\nHe defended his master's thesis in 1981, and in 1986, he defended his dissertation in 1986 at the Faculty of Economics and Business at the University of Maribor. In 1982, he became head of the local branch of Ljubljana Bank in his home region of the Central Sava Valley in central Slovenia. In 1986 he was chosen to be a delegate at the Slovenian Republic Assembly (parliament) and also the Chamber of Republics and Provinces of the Yugoslav parliament.\n\nIn 1989, Stane Dolanc, the Slovenian representative to the collective presidency of Yugoslavia, retired. The Slovenian Communist Party, aware of upcoming democratisation, decided to organize elections between two candidates for the position. Drnovšek, until then rather unknown to the public, defeated , the Party's preferred candidate. \n\nThe Communist leaderships of other Yugoslav republics did not agree with this new way of selecting the representative to the Collective Presidency, so the Slovenian Republic Parliament had to confirm the result of the elections. Drnovšek served as chairman of the Collective Presidency from 1989-90. While he was chairman of the presidency, he was also chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement and the commander of the Yugoslav People's Army. \n\nUntil the end of communist rule he was an active member of the Communist Party. After the democratic changes in Slovenia, the country seceded from Yugoslavia. Following the Ten Day War, Drnovšek used his position in the Collective Presidency to help mediate the Brioni Agreement and to negotiate a peaceful withdrawal of Yugoslav army from Slovenia.\n\nIn 1992, after a Government crisis in the DEMOS coalition, which had won the first democratic elections in Slovenia in 1990 and led the country to independence, Drnovšek became the second Prime Minister of independent Slovenia. He was chosen as a compromise candidate and an expert in economic policy. \n\nHis bi-partisan government was supported both by the left and centrist wing of the dissolved DEMOS coalition (the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia, the Democratic Party and the Greens of Slovenia) and by three parties that derived from organizations of the former Communist regime (the Liberal Democratic Party, the Party of Democratic Reform and the Socialist Party of Slovenia).\n\nShortly afterwards, Drnovšek was elected president of the Liberal Democratic Party (\"Liberalno demokratska stranka\" – LDS), the legal successor of the Association of Socialist Youth of Slovenia (\"Zveza socialistične mladine Slovenije\" – ZSMS), the youth fraction of the Communist Party of Slovenia.\n\nIn 1992, the Liberal Democratic Party under Drnovšek's leadership won the parliamentary elections, but due to a high fragmentation of the popular vote had to ally itself with other parties in order to form a stable government. Despite a politically turbulent mandate (in 1994, the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia left the coalition), the Party gained votes in 1996, remaining the largest party in the government. \n\nNevertheless, Drnovšek barely secured himself a third term in office after a failed attempt to ally himself with the Slovenian National Party. In 1997, the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia formed a coalition government with the populist Slovenian People's Party which finally enabled Drnovšek to serve a third term in office.\n\nHe headed the government until May 2000, when he stepped down due to disagreements with the Slovenian People's Party. After less than six months in opposition, Drnovšek returned to power in the autumn of 2000, after his party gained a clear victory in the parliamentary elections.\n\nDrnovšek's governments guided Slovenia's political and economic reconstruction. He successfully tackled the twin tasks of reorienting Slovenia's trade away from the wreckage of the old Yugoslavia towards the West and replacing the ineffective Communist-era business model with more market-based mechanisms.\n\nUnlike the other five former Yugoslav republics which were run for much of the 1990s by frequently authoritarian presidents, Slovenia under Drnovšek's premiership quickly emerged from the break-up of the federation as a functioning parliamentary democracy. Drnovšek's political strategy was concentrated on broad coalitions, transcending ideological and programmatic divisions between parties.\nContrary to some other former Communist countries in Eastern Europe, the economic and social transformation in Slovenia pursued by Drnovšek's governments followed a gradualist approach.\n\nDrnovšek was a staunch supporter of Slovenia's entry in the European Union and NATO and was largely responsible for Slovenia's successful bid for membership in both of those organizations. As Prime minister, he was frequently active on foreign policy issues. On 16 June 2001, he helped to arrange the first meeting of the U.S. President George W. Bush with the Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was held in the Upper Carniolan estate of Brdo pri Kranju. (Bush-Putin 2001) In 2002, he ran for President of Slovenia, and was elected in the second round, defeating the center-right candidate Barbara Brezigar.\n\nDrnovšek's presidency was highly controversial. In the first three years in office, he rarely appeared in public, save for the most important official duties. In 2006, however, a change of style became visible. He launched several campaigns in foreign policy, such as a failed humanitarian mission to Darfur and a proposal for the solution of the political crisis in Kosovo. On January 30, 2006, he left the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. Shortly afterwards, he founded the Movement for Justice and Development and became its first president. He claimed this was not meant to be a political movement, but rather a wide initiative, aiming to \"raise human consciousness and make the world a better place\". On June 26, 2006, he announced that he would not be running for a second term in an interview on TV Slovenia.\n\nThe 2004 legislative election brought further changes and a political swing to the right. Janez Janša, the leader of a right-wing coalition, formed the new government. In Slovenia, this was the first time after 1992 that the President and the Prime Minister had represented opposing political factions for more than a few months. Between 2002-04, the relationship between President Drnovšek and Janez Janša, then leader of the opposition, were considered more than good and in the first year of cohabitation, no major problems arose.\n\nIn the beginning of his term, Drnovšek, who was ill with kidney cancer, stayed out of public view. When he reemerged in late 2005 he had already changed his lifestyle: he had become a vegan (though one of his colleagues in a televised interview mentioned their regular sunday visits to a pizzeria in Maxi market, Ljubljana), moved out of the capital into the countryside, and withdrew from party politics completely, ending his already frozen membership in the Liberal Democracy. Drnovšek's new approach to politics prompted one political commentator to nickname him \"Slovenia's Gandhi\".\n\nThe relationship between Drnovšek and the government quickly became tense. Disagreements began with Drnovšek's initiatives in foreign politics, aimed at solving major foreign conflicts, including those in Darfur and Kosovo. Initially, these initiatives were initially not openly opposed by the Prime Minister, but were criticized by the foreign minister Dimitrij Rupel, Drnovšek's former collaborator and close political ally until 2004. \n\nA major clash between the two happened in Summer 2006, when disagreement arose over Drnovšek's attempt to intervene in the Darfur conflict. The disagreements moved from issues of domestic politics in October 2006, when Drnovšek publicly criticised the treatment of the Strojans, a Romani family whose neighborhood had forced them to relocate, which in turn had subjected them to police supervision and limitation of movement. \n\nThe disagreements however escalated when the parliamentary majority repeatedly rejected President's candidates for the Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, beginning with the rejection of incumbent Mitja Gaspari. The friction continued over the appointment of other state official nominees, including Constitutional Court judges. Although the President's political support suffered after his personal transformation, the polls nevertheless showed public backing of the President against an increasingly unpopular Government.\nThe tension reached its apex in May 2007, when the newly appointed director of the Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency Matjaž Šinkovec unclassified several documents from the period before 2004, revealing, among other, that Drnovšek had used secret service funds for personal purposes between 2002-04. The President reacted with a harsh criticism of the government's policies, accusing the ruling coalition of abusing its power for personal delegitimations and labeled the Prime Minister as \"the leader of the negative guys\"\n\nIn the last months in office, Drnovšek continued his attacks on Prime Minister Janez Janša, who mostly remained silent on the issue. Drnovšek accused Janša of \"fostering proto-totalitarian tendencies\". He became a blogger (Janez D), signing his posts as \"Janez D\" and expressing opinions on various issues from foreign policy, environmentalism, human relationships, religion, animal rights and personal growth. In his last months in office, he withdrew to a reclusive life again, devoting his time to the Movement for Justice and Development and the popularization of his lifestyle and views.\n\nDuring his time in office as the President of Slovenia, he wrote and published several books in spiritual philosophy, including \"Misli o življenju in zavedanju\" (\"Thoughts on Life and Consciousness\"), \"Zlate misli o življenju in zavedanju\" (\"Golden Thoughts on Life and Consciousness\"), \"Bistvo sveta\" (\"The Essence of the World\"), and his last one called \"Pogovori\" or Dialogues. According to his own accounts, it took him only two or three weeks to write each of his books, due to – in his words – \"the higher consciousness\" he was able to access.\n\nHis lifestyle was a mixture of elements from various traditions, including Hindu religious thought and the non-attachment of Buddhist philosophy. He also valued the indigenous traditions of the world. For example, he was present at the inauguration of Evo Morales, the first native American president of Bolivia, and later hosted Bolivian ethnic musicians in the Presidential Palace in Ljubljana. After his diagnosis, Drnovšek became a vegan, and claims that this greatly improved his health.\n\nBecause of his new lifestyle and the content of his books and blogs, he was often regarded as an adherent of the New Age movement, although he rejected such a qualification as being too narrow.\n\nDrnovšek was fluent in six languages, Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, English, Spanish, French and German.\nHe was divorced with one son, Jaša, who is a translator and journalist. \n\nIn 2005, he found out about the existence of a daughter, Nana Forte, otherwise a renowned composer. His sister is Helena Drnovšek Zorko, who has been the Slovenian ambassador in Japan since September 2010. \n\nIn 1999, Drnovšek had kidney cancer resulting in the removal of a kidney. In 2001, he had cancerous formations on his lungs and liver. He repeatedly claimed nature was the best cure, and spent most of his days at his home in Zaplana. He died there on February 23, 2008, aged 57. His body was cremated shortly afterwards. He was buried with honors in a private memorial service in his native Zagorje ob Savi, alongside his parents.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2573296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2573296", "title": "Joseph Kibweteere", "text": "Joseph Kibweteere\n\nJoseph Kibwetere was one of the leaders of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, a group that splintered from the Roman Catholic Church in Uganda and became infamous after 778 of its members were found dead. Although it was initially assumed that Joseph died in the incident the Ugandan police shortly afterwards issued a warrant for arrest against Joseph Kibweteere and the other leaders of the group. In 2014 it was announced by the Uganda National Police that there were reports that Kibweteere was hiding in Malawi.\n\nMany details of Kibweteere's life, and especially death, remain unclear. What is known is that he came from a strongly pious Catholic background and was likely wealthy by Ugandan standards. The second idea comes from the fact he ran for political office in 1980 and had enough land to donate for a school of his own design. The Catholic school he founded and led was apparently orthodox and at that point he had a positive image in the community. In 1960 he married a woman who would prove to outlive him.\n\nThe Uganda he lived in suffered from both religious and political upheaval which likely influenced him. The strongest of which may have been religious movements that emphasized miracles and Marian apparitions. In 1984 he claimed to be experiencing sightings of the Virgin Mary. This vision had been brought to him by Credonia Mwerinde.\nMt Randz\n\nAround 1989 he came into contact with a woman named Credonia Mwerinde, a prostitute who claimed she was looking to repent for her sins. She had a background of claimed experiences dating back further than Kibweteere. Credonia claimed that she could see the virgin Mary when looking at a stone on the mountains. The stone looked the spitting image of the Virgin Mary. Her father claimed to have had a vision of his dead daughter Evangelista as early as 1960. His children and grandchildren would be affected by this. By 1989, Credonia and her Ursula were travelling through Uganda spreading the family's message. When Credonia met Joseph he welcomed her with open arms and shared his own experiences. This would lead to their forming the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God.\n\nAfter the death of Credonia's father, he became leader of the group. In the 1990s they strongly emphasized apocalypticism in their booklet \"A Timely Message from Heaven: The End of the Present Time\". Hence he led an elite group of six men and six women deemed to be the \"new apostles.\" These apostles had an equal number of women because of the emphasis they placed on Mother Mary as instrumental in sweeping them toward heaven. The group stated several dates where it would be the end of the world, however, several of these dates passed by with no sign of an apocalypse. Reportedly he stated that the year 2000 would be followed by \"year 1 of the new world.\" These and other claims had little effect on the wider world. For the most part he remained an obscure figure in Uganda and never formally split with the Catholic Church.\n\nIn March 2000 the group began slaughtering cattle and buying massive amounts of Coca-Cola. These events did not initially raise alarm, but they were preparation for a feast before death. On March 17, Kibweteere apparently died in the group's mass suicide. A member of Kibweteere's family stated that Joseph's actions were completely influenced by Credonia Mwerinde.\n\nA great deal remains unclear about his story and the movement. The BBC reported that Kibweteere had been treated for bipolar disorder a year or so before the group suicide. At the time the Ugandan authorities considered him a fugitive and mass-murderer because they believed him to have escaped. The date and nature of the apocalypse they expected is debated. There is one camp that indicates they believed it would come in 1999 and that the 2000 suicide was caused by the failure of that prophecy. This would seem confirmed by some of their activities of 1999, but in their literature 2000 is often seen as the end year. The nature of his role and significance to the events is also disputed. Due to the circumstances of events, satisfactory answers to these and other questions may never be forthcoming. Kibwetere did all this in the Kanungu district in western Uganda.\n\n\n"}

Throughout the 1960s, Mitchell was active in leftist politics, and was on the editorial committee of the journal, \"New Left Review\".\n\nMitchell gained instant media attention with her pathbreaking article “Women: The Longest Revolution\", in the \"New Left Review\" (1966), an original synthesis of Simone de Beauvoir, Frederich Engels, Viola Klein, Betty Friedan and other analysts of women's oppression.\n\nShe is a fellow professor of Psychoanalysis at the Jesus College, Cambridge and founded the Centre for Gender Studies at Cambridge University. \nIn 2010 she is appointed director of the Expanded Doctoral School in Psychoanalytic Studies at the Psychoanalysis Unit of University College London (UCL).\n\nShe is a retired registrant of the British Psychoanalytic Council.\n\nMitchell is best known for her book \"Psychoanalysis and Feminism: Freud, Reich, Laing and Women\" (1974), in which she tried to reconcile psychoanalysis and feminism at a time when many considered them incompatible. Peter Gay considered it \"the most rewarding and responsible contribution\" to the feminist debate on Freud, both acknowledging and rising beyond Freud's male chauvinism in its analysis. Mitchell saw Freud's asymmetrical view of masculinity and femininity as reflecting the realities of patriarchal culture, and sought to use his critique of femininity to critique patriarchy itself. By insisting on the utility of Freud (particularly in a Lacanian reading) for feminism, she opened the way for further critical work on psychoanalysis and gender.She was an Andrew Dickson White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University from 1993 to 1999.\n\nA substantial part of the thesis of the book is that Marxism may provide a model within which non-patriarchal structures for rearing children could occur. The lack of the 'family romance' would remove the Oedipus complex from a child's development, thus liberating women from the consequences of penis envy and the feeling of being castrated which Mitchell contends is the root cause of women's acceptance that they are inferior. According to Mitchell, children are socialised into appropriate gender roles. Therefore, women grow to be equally socialised into becoming the caretakers of their households.\n\nIn her introduction to Jacques Lacan on feminine sexuality, Mitchell stresses that \"in the Freud that Lacan uses, neither the unconscious nor sexuality...[are] pre-given facts, they are constructions; that is, they are objects with histories\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Council of Forty-four, a tribal governance devoted to maintaining peace with encroaching United States settlers. Lean Bear's most notable peace deals include the Treaty of Fort Wise and a meeting with US President Abraham Lincoln. His work towards peace between his people and the American settlers in the Southern Plains was cut short when he was killed by the 1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment and violent retaliations ensued.\n\nLean Bear suffered from vertigo, which commonly ran in the family. During a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, he suffered an attack and spoke while seated in a chair. Lean Bear brushed it off as a result of him simply being too nervous to stand.\n\nLean Bear had a brother called Bull Bear. In 1864, Bull Bear was the leader of the Dog Soldiers, a position he would hold for many years.\n\nLean Bear also worked closely and served on the Council of Forty-four with fellow peace chief Black Kettle, especially in the last decade of his life.\n\nThe first known account in history of Lean Bear is in 1851. He was roughly 35 at this time. Agent Thomas Fitzpatrick was hosting a council in Fort Atkinson to convince plains tribes to attend a larger peace council at Fort Laramie later on. The Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, Arapaho, and Cheyenne people went out to meet the soldiers and each other. They feasted and traded goods. Fitzpatrick spoke with each group, and eventually convinced the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes to attend the next peace council. The other tribes refused, wary about bringing their horses up north near tribes that were notorious for stealing horses.\n\nThe troops were beginning to leave as the council ended when Colonel Sumner arrived at Fort Atkinson on his way to New Mexico. He stayed for a few days to trade and obtain some horses from the tribes in attendance. After some time, the tribes began to freely explore both the fort and his camp, and Fitzpatrick grew nervous at the opportunities for conflict. Lean Bear, who was in attendance at the peace council, was fascinated by the rings and bracelets on the hand of Sumner's wife and grabbed to get a better look. She reacted by pulling her hand back and screaming, provoking Sumner to rush forward to beat Lean Bear. Because Cheyenne culture considers striking even a male child to be an insult, Lean Bear was incredibly indignant about the assault. He painted his face and rode around his camp announcing his plans to attack the whites, inviting his brothers to join him. Fitzpatrick initially refused to make reparations until some Kiowas and Comanches told him that the Cheyennes were getting ready to attack. A meeting was later arranged for Colonel Sumner to present Lean Bear with a blanket in apology, which he accepted.\n\nLean Bear was chosen to join the Council of Forty-four by past chiefs, as the council chose its own successors. The council worked to sway their people towards a preference for peace with the Americans. Once named a chief of the council, one would have to give up membership in the war societies that new chiefs often came from. These efforts contrasted with the increasingly vocal Dog Soldiers, bands of Cheyennes who held a longstanding opposition to white settlement and did not wait to cooperate and make peace. They stole livestock and fought with troops and settlers. The Dog Soldiers were exiled for their behavior and deemed renegades, operating independently of the tribe. Nonetheless, their provocative nature caused a lot of trouble for the peace-seeking Cheyennes.\n\nOn October 1857, Chief Lean Bear and three other Cheyenne chiefs approached William Bent with concern about attacks on his people by Sumner's troops along the Republican River. Bent then sent a letter to Washington D.C. on their behalf, stating that the Cheyenne chiefs would like to speak with someone from the government. The response came in 1860, when Commissioner A.B. Greenwood met the chiefs at Fort Wise. Chief Lean Bear was one of the principal signers in the Treaty of Fort Wise in 1861. This treaty was made with Cheyenne and Arapaho chiefs, cutting roughly 40 million acres of land from their territory.\n\nThere were mixed responses to the deal, including scorn from the Dog Soldiers, because only six Cheyenne chiefs were present to sign the treaty, when all forty-four are typically needed when treaties and alliances are being made. The deal was made in an attempt to keep peace as pioneers spread near Indian territory, but the land reduction and the continued encroachment by white settlers only heightened tensions. The Cheyennes were not ready to forced into the confines of the small reserve, where there were not many buffalo, allocated for them in the treaty.\n\nOn March 27, 1863, a delegation of chiefs and two women met with President Abraham Lincoln in the East room of the White House. The meeting was called after skirmishes with Native tribes and white settlers created fear that southern plains tribes would side with the confederacy. Lincoln was hoping to persuade Native Nations to either ally with the Union, or pledge neutrality.\n\nLincoln welcomed the chiefs, explaining that white Americans had conquered an expansive population, territory, and wealth that white Americans had gained. Lean Bear implored the president to stop his white Americans from being violent so that Indians and whites alike could travel across the plains without risk. Lincoln told the chiefs that their Native people were naturally more tempted to violence. He further explained that in order to survive and be prosperous, the Native Americans would have to adopt methods of cultivating the land that were more similar to the way of the whites. Lincoln also requested that the southern Plains Indians remain neutral in the American Civil War, ready to provide peace medals to those that he could reach an agreement with. The chiefs complied, promising to uphold peace treaties and not align with the confederacy. Lean Bear then made a request to the president to expedite his and the other chiefs' journey home.\n\nOn May 16, 1864, less than 15 months after meeting Lincoln in Washington, Lean Bear, Black Kettle, and others in the tribe were camping on their buffalo hunting grounds near Ash Creek. The 1st Colorado Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant George Eayre, approached the group. Although there had been a fight around a month previous involving Cheyenne Dog Soldiers at Fremont's Orchard, Lean Bear was confident that the violence wouldn't be associated with his peaceful tribe and was not concerned as the soldiers got closer. Positive that this would be a peaceful encounter, Lean Bear went alone to meet the militia to show his peaceful intentions. On his chest, Lean Bear proudly wore his peace medal that he had received on his trip to Washington D.C. in 1863. In his hand, he held an official document signed by President Lincoln stating that he was peaceful and friendly with whites. What Lean Bear did not realize was that Eayre's troops were operating under orders from Colonel John M. Chivington to \"kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found.\" Eayre ordered his men to shoot Lean Bear, who was wounded and fell off his horse. He was then shot repeatedly by the soldiers as they rode past his body on the ground.\n\nThe troops rode on to attack other Cheyennes at the camp, killing at least one more warrior and wounding many others at the camp. Cheyenne warriors armed themselves and mounted their horses, ready to retaliate. Black Kettle rode out to de-escalate the situation, stopping any further violence, and the American troops retreated to Fort Larned.\n\nRising tensions caused by the death of Lean Bear, along with Eayre's other Indian camp raids, is heavily attributed to the Sand Creek Massacre that occurred six months later. Lean Bear's brother, Bull Bear, was livid after the killing and felt compelled to violence against the white men, a desire he had never felt before. Bull Bear remarked that his brother had died while trying to keep peace with the settlers, and he expected to die in the same way. He called for war but was shot down at a meeting with Wynkoop, the Fort Lyon Commander, on September 10, 1864. Despite Black Kettle's best efforts to keep the peace, attacks by Native warriors in the Southern Plains skyrocketed as the vengeful tribes burned ranches and trails, kidnapping settlers and their livestock. Over time, the Dog Soldiers' popularity rose, and they overrode Black Kettle's efforts to resist war. The Governor of Colorado issued a proclamation giving each citizen permission and encouragement to retaliate by killing any Indians and seek compensation for stolen property.\n\nThere are no confirmed images of Lean Bear. There are only images and paintings of the full room in 1863 when the delegation went to meet president Lincoln. There are many differing accounts on the identities of each chief in the image. In common usage by sources about Lean Bear is an image of a Cheyenne peace chief who is typically believed to be Lean Bear.\n\nParts of Lean Bear's life are described in the book of folklore, \"By Cheyenne Campfires\", compiled by George Bird Grinnell.\n\n"}

Born Lev Zadov, he changed his last name to Zinkovsky.\n\nLev Zadov was born in the Russian Jewish agricultural colony Veselaya. About 1898-1900 his family fell on hard times and moved to Yuzovka, where his father found work as a coachman. Zadov graduated at a Jewish elementary school there and started to work as a manual laborer at a mill, later working at Yuzovka Metallurgical Works.\n\nLev Zadov joined the Yuzovka Metallurgical Works anarchist group before 1912. He participated in several armed robberies (the then-popular way for anarchist groups to finance their activities), as well as distributing propaganda pamphlets. He was arrested and convicted in 1913 for robbery of a post office and sentenced to 8 years of penal labour.\n\nZadov was released after the February Revolution in February 1917 along with other revolutionary prisoners. He was elected a member of the city Soviet in Yuzovka soon after that. Zadov had been instrumental in organizing the anarchist paramilitary force in Yuzovka and joined the Red Army in Spring 1918 with this group. His junior brother Daniel had been member of the force too. Zadov quickly rose through the ranks and became deputy regiment commander. Zadov's regiment fought advancing German Army and Tsentralna Rada troops, but was defeated and withdrew toward Tsaritsyn. The Zadov brothers defected from the Red Army there and returned to the Ukraine to join the anarchists.\n\nLev Zadov joined Nestor Makhno's guerrillas in August 1918 and quickly became chief of military intelligence of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine (also known as the Black Army). According to numerous eyewitnesses, he was a member of Makhno's inner circle and friend of Makhno's wife. Zadov is credited with personally saving Makhno's life several times during skirmishes with Red Army forces. On August 28, 1921 Zadov organized the escape of remnants of Makhnovist guerrilla forces to Romania. Romanian security services recruited him and his brother in 1924 to join an anti-Soviet underground group to be sent to the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter crossing the Soviet-Romanian border Zadov surrendered to Soviet authorities and joined the OGPU, working in their office in Odessa. Daniel Zadov (Zotov) became an OGPU operative in Tiraspol. Zadov had been instrumental in the annihilation of several Anti-Soviet militant groups. He is credited with running one of the most successful Soviet intelligence operations against Romania, and had been awarded with a personal gilded weapon for the \"successful fight against counter-revolution\". The Zadov brothers were arrested during the Great Purge in September 1937 and accused of collaboration with Romanian security services. The Zadov brothers' trial took place on September 25, 1938 and lasted only 15 minutes. Both Lev and Daniel were convicted of \"collaboration with foreign secret services\" and executed by firing squad on September 25, 1938.\n\nLev Zadov married Vera Matvienko in 1925 and had a daughter, Alla Zinkovskaya (born 1925), and son, Vadim Zinkovsky (born 1926). Alla Zinkovskaya volunteered to join Red Army in the beginning of the Soviet-German War. She was killed on June 13, 1942 fighting in the Sevastopol. Vadim joined the Red Army in 1944 (age 18) and became a commissioned officer. Vadim Zinkovsky retired from the Soviet Army as a colonel in 1977.\n\nLev Zadov is depicted in Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy's \"The Road to Calvary\" novels as a ruthless but cowardly killer, who participates in numerous atrocities against civilians but shies away from battle engagements. The phrases \"Hide your teeth or I'll swing them out\" and \"I'm Leva Zadov, I'll speak and you'll fear\" attributed to him by Tolstoy, became part of Russian slang. It is proven today that Tolstoy used a pamphlet published in 1924 in Kiev for his information on Zadov.\n\n"}

With no immediate family, and with personal disputes with many members of the Royal Society, no memorials were erected in his honor on the occasion of his death. On the occasion of the tercentenary of his death in 2003, several efforts were made to address this situation.\n\nEddie Smith, former Undermaster and archivist at Westminster School of which Hooke was a member, worked tirelessly on Hooke's behalf to get him a small memorial in Westminster Abbey. The work took years but eventually in 2005 one was unveiled. The inscription reads \"Robert Hooke 1703\" and is carved from one of the black marble tiles in the floor beneath the Lantern, near the pulpit. This is appropriate as Hooke was responsible for the laying of this floor.\n\nHooke's name was omitted from the Monument to the Great Fire of London (known generally as just \"The Monument\"), erected to commemorate the Great Fire of London in 1666, as Sir Christopher Wren has generally been given credit for the design of this monument. The new inscription acknowledges Hooke’s role in the monument's development.\n\nAs part of a project to improve the area around the pillar in 2007 it was possible to take a space in the paving for a large () carved stone. The stone was quarried at Caithness and made its long journey down to London to be carved at the workshop of Richard Kindersley. It can be seen from the entrance to the Monument Underground Station and is now included in sightseeing tours for tourists. \n\nThe wording on the memorial was written by Dr. Allan Chapman.\n\nHooke's memorial at St. Paul's Cathedral is on the wall in the crypt of the cathedral, next to the tomb of Sir Christopher Wren. The quotation around the edge is from \"Micrographia\", Hooke's amazing book, published in 1665.\n\nAt the bottom of the memorial is an engraved metal bookworm in brass and chrome, recessed into the stone surface.\n\nAs the crypt is rather a dark place, a pale, ivory-coloured stone was chosen and the carved letters were painted with blue and brownish-red watercolour to make them more easily readable.\n\nThe memorial was dedicated by the Dean of St. Paul's after a special Evensong.\n\nArtist Rita Greer has created several new images of Hooke and donated them to various sites.\n\nThis portrait in oils is the first of a series of memorial portraits. It shows a list of Hooke's interests and skills. It now hangs in the hall at Gresham College in the City of London. Hooke was Professor of Geometry for many years at the original Gresham College, at the site where the NatWest Tower now stands.\n\nThis painting shows Hooke as a child on the Isle of Wight, holding the model boat he made, with the church of All Saints (where his father was curate) in the background and the river medina.\n\nThis memorial painting now hangs in the Seminar Room of the Robert Hooke Science Building at the Open University in Milton Keynes. It shows Hooke concerned with minute objects and huge objects. The emphasis is on astronomy. It was unveiled in February 2009.\n\nChurch of St Mary Magdalene is Hooke's only remaining church, not far from the Open University. He designed it for Dr. Richard Busby, the first headmaster of Westminster School. The memorial painting shows the church in the background.\n\nThis memorial was commissioned for the Master's office at the Department of Engineering Science of Oxford University in 2009. It shows a portrait of Robert Hooke as an engineer with a few of his inventions – the universal joint, wheel barometer and pocket watch. Other features of his work are the spring, an optic and his microscope with open pages of his book \"Micrographia\". He holds a chain to make a catenary arch. Through the window can be seen the Bodleian Library and the Sheldonian Theatre, linking him with Oxford where he was an undergraduate.\n"}
{"id": "2838133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2838133", "title": "Louise Hay", "text": "Louise Hay\n\nLouise Lynn Hay (October 8, 1926 – August 30, 2017) was an American motivational author and the founder of Hay House. She authored several New Thought self-help books, including the 1984 book, \"You Can Heal Your Life\".\n\nBorn Helen Vera Lunney in Los Angeles to parents Henry John Lunney (1901–1998) and Veronica Chwala (1894–1985), Hay recounted her life story in an interview with Mark Oppenheimer of \"The New York Times\" in May 2008. In it, Hay stated that she was born in Los Angeles to a poor mother who remarried Louise's violent stepfather Ernest Carl Wanzenreid (1903-1992), who physically abused her and her mother. According to Hay, when she was about 5, she was raped by a neighbor. At 15, she dropped out of University High School in Los Angeles without a diploma, became pregnant and, on her 16th birthday, gave up her newborn baby girl for adoption. She then moved to Chicago, where she worked in low-paying jobs. In 1950, she moved on again, to New York. At this point she changed her first name, and began a career as a fashion model. She achieved success, working for Bill Blass, Oleg Cassini, and Pauline Trigère. In 1954, she married the English businessman Andrew Hay (1928-2001); after 14 years of marriage, she felt devastated when he left her for another woman, Sharman Douglas (1928-1996).\n\nHay said that about this time she found the First Church of Religious Science on 48th Street, which taught her the transformative power of thought. Hay revealed that here she studied the New Thought works of authors like Florence Scovel Shinn, who claimed that positive thinking could change people’s material circumstances, and the Religious Science founder Ernest Holmes, who taught that positive thinking could heal the body.\n\nBy Hay's account, in the early 1970s she became a Religious Science practitioner. In this role she led people in spoken affirmations, which she believes would cure their illnesses, and became popular as a workshop leader. She also recalled how she had studied Transcendental Meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa.\n\nHay described how in 1977 or 1978 she was diagnosed with \"incurable\" cervical cancer, and how she came to the conclusion that by holding on to her resentment for her childhood abuse and rape she had contributed to its onset. She reported how she had refused conventional medical treatment, and began a regime of forgiveness, coupled with therapy, nutrition, reflexology, and occasional colonic enemas. She claimed in the interview that she rid herself of the cancer by this method, but, while swearing to its truth, admitted that she had outlived every doctor who could confirm this story.\n\nIn 1976, Hay wrote her first book, \"Heal Your Body\", which began as a small pamphlet containing a list of different bodily ailments and their “probable” metaphysical causes. This pamphlet was later enlarged and extended into her book \"You Can Heal Your Life\", published in 1984. In February 2008, it was second on the New York Times miscellaneous paperback best-sellers list.\n\nAround the same time she began leading support groups for people living with HIV/AIDS, which she called \"Hay Rides\". These grew from a few people in her living room to hundreds of men in a large hall in West Hollywood, California. Her work with AIDS patients drew fame and she was invited to appear on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and \"The Phil Donahue Show\" in the same week, in March 1988. Following this, \"You Can Heal Your Life\" immediately landed on the New York Times best-seller list. More than 50 million copies sold around the world in over 30 languages and it also has been made into a movie. \"You Can Heal Your Life\" is also included in the book \"50 Self-Help Classics\" for being significant in its field.\n\nHay wrote, on page 225 of her book, (December 2008 printing) that the book has \"... sold more than thirty five million copies\". It was announced in 2011 that \"You Can Heal your Life\" had reached 40 million sales.\n\nLouise Hay died in her sleep on the morning of August 30, 2017 at age 90.\n\nIn 1984, Hay established the Hay House publishing firm. In 1988 Reid Tracy joined the company as an accountant and would eventually become its CEO. The business flourished and attracted various writers. Hay House is the primary publisher of books and audio books by over 130 authors, including Deepak Chopra and Doreen Virtue, as well as many books by Wayne Dyer. Hay House also publishes the teachings of \"Abraham\" as channeled through Esther Hicks.\n\nIn addition to running her publishing company, Hay ran a charitable organization called the Hay Foundation, which she founded in 1985.\n\nIn 2008, a movie about Louise Hay's life was released, titled \"You Can Heal Your Life\". In Hay's own words on the film's official Web site: \"This movie is the story of my life, my teachings, and how I've applied the principles of my teachings to my own life.\" The movie also features notable speakers and authors in the field of personal development including Gregg Braden, Wayne Dyer, Gay Hendricks, Esther and Jerry Hicks, and Doreen Virtue; it was directed by Emmy Award-winning director Michael A. Goorjian. In the same year Louise Hay won a Minerva Award at The Women's Conference.\n\nIn September 2011, Hay and Cheryl Richardson released their book \"You Can Create An Exceptional Life\".\n\n\n\nLouise Hay Interview from The Telegraph is not available anymore.\n\n"}

The event shocked the Israeli public, partly because an investigation ruled that the sniper had deliberately aimed for the baby. According to Deborah Sontag of New York Times, the murder became a \"potent Israeli symbol as an innocent victim of the raging violence\".\n\nOn March 26, 2001, at 4:00 pm, Shalhevet was shot in her stroller while her parents were accompanying her from a parking lot by the Avraham Avinu neighborhood in Hebron, where she and her family lived.\n\nA Palestinian sniper resumed firing, after a ten-minute lull, from the Abu Sneinah neighborhood on the hill opposite. Shalhevet was killed instantly. The baby's mother grabbed her when she heard the gunshots, only to discover that the child was already dead. One of the sniper's bullets penetrated the baby's head, passing through her skull, and hit her father as well. Shalhevet's father, Yitzchak Pass, a student, who had been pushing the stroller, was also seriously wounded minutes later by two bullets.\n\nPress accounts indicated that the playground was very busy at the time, because a load of new sand had recently been delivered. According to unconfirmed accounts, another child was grazed by a bullet and two more had bullets pass through their clothing.\n\nThe murder, which occurred during the Second Intifada, produced vocal outrage in Israel and abroad. The nation mourned the killing of the baby.\n\nPrime Minister Ariel Sharon condemned the attack and sent his condolences to the Pass family. Sharon also stated that he saw the Palestinian Authority as responsible for the attack. The Jewish community in Hebron demanded that the Israeli army reoccupy the Abu Sneineh neighborhood in Hebron, and the Pass family even stated that they would not bury their baby until the IDF would reoccupy the Abu Sneineh neighborhood.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority initially arrested the sniper but released him after a short while. On 9 December 2002 the Shin Bet managed to capture the sniper – the Tanzim member Mahmud Amru. In December 2004 a military court convicted the killer and sentenced him to three life terms.\n\nAccording to the Israeli government, an investigation concluded that the sniper had intentionally targeted the baby. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said: The fact that they could pick off the baby and then the father makes this a hideous, deliberate, cold-blooded murder. Snipers are not just gun-toting youth... If Arafat had wanted, the sniper would not have been there.\n\nIn the verdict the judges expressed their shock of the brutality of the murder:\"It was enough for one bullet, fired from a sniper rifle, to end the life of the infant Shalhevet Pass, who up to that event was unknown to the wide public, and just lived her life as all other children, until one day as the evening came she was hit in her head, and she died, and Shalhevet whom was still small and in her infant stage, was sentenced to death by a vile killer whom intentionally, using a Telescopic sight, pulled the trigger. The picture of the shot baby is on our table, is engraved in our minds and does not give peace to our souls. We cannot understand and we cannot accept the unbearable ease with which the killer decided to harm a helpless person... We the judges are only humans and we cannot see anything else but the image which emerges in our senses, an image full of hate, blood and bereavement. We must not accept this image and we need to do everything we can to condemn it.\"\nThe child's father, Yitzchak Pass, later joined the Bat Ayin Underground terrorist group which planned to blow up a Palestinian girls' school in East Jerusalem and was eventually arrested and convicted for possession of 10 pounds of explosive. He served a two-year prison sentence.\n\nThe Associated Press ran the story with the headline \"Jewish toddler dies in West Bank\" and was criticized by Joshua Levy in his book \"The Agony of the Promised Land\" for downplaying the murder.\n\nThe \"Voice of Palestine\", the Palestinian Authority's official radio station, reported that the report of the girl's shooting death was a lie, and that the girl's mother had murdered her own baby.\n\nA song was dedicated to the memory of \"Baby Shalhevet\", sung by Avraham Fried at a concert in Hebron. The song was written by Fried's brother Rabbi Manis Friedman.\n\n\n"}

He received a Ph.D. in physics from Stanford University in 1967 for work on nuclear scattering experiments. After a one-year teaching job at Monmouth College in Illinois, Herbert held a number of posts in industry. The most illustrious of these was senior physicist at Memorex Corporation in Santa Clara, California, where he developed new magnetic materials, as well as magnetic, electrostatic and optical measuring devices, and carried out theoretical work on Lorentz microscopy. He was also senior physicist at Smith-Corona Marchant Corporation in Palo Alto, California where he developed a new theory of xerographic process and worked on early developments in ink jet printing.\n\nWhile employed in industry, Herbert was part of the Fundamental Fysiks Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, founded in May 1975 by Elizabeth Rauscher and George Weissmann. The group's initial interest was in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the EPR paradox, and Bell's inequality, but members pursued diverse interests that lay outside of mainstream physics, exploring psychedelic drugs, psi phenomena, the nature of consciousness, and speculative connections of these areas with quantum physics. During the 1970s and 1980s, Herbert and Saul-Paul Sirag organized a yearly Esalen Seminar on the Nature of Reality, bringing together participants to discuss the interpretation of quantum mechanics. With Richard Shoup of Xerox PARC, Herbert constructed a \"Metaphase Typewriter\", a \"quantum operated\" device whose purpose was \"to communicate with disembodied spirits\". Despite many tests, including an attempt to contact the spirit of Harry Houdini on the hundredth anniversary of his birth, the group reported no success with the device.\n\nHerbert supports a holistic interpretation of quantum physics. He has argued for \"quantum animism\" in which mind permeates the world at every level. Werner Krieglstein wrote regarding his quantum animism:\nIn 1981, Herbert proposed \"FLASH\", a scheme for sending signals faster than the speed of light using quantum entanglement. Of this proposal, quantum computing pioneer Asher Peres wrote, \"I was the referee who approved the publication of Nick Herbert’s \"FLASH paper\", knowing perfectly well that it was wrong. I explain why my decision was the correct one, and I briefly review the progress to which it led.\" Chief among the results that Peres claimed stemmed from a refutation of Herbert's proposal was the no-cloning theorem, proved by Wootters, Zurek, and Dieks.\n\n\n"}

Foot is known for his musings, rants, \"disturbances\" and apparent aversion to pop culture. The \"Daily Express\" likened him to \"a rare exotic bird\", and six national newspapers including \"The Independent\" and \"The Age\" have described him as \"a comedy genius\".\n\nFoot was born and raised in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and has a younger brother. He studied mathematics at Merton College, Oxford. It was during his studies that he first started performing stand-up. As of 2011, Foot has refused to discuss his years at Oxford or former pursuits as a mathematics student. Graduating from Oxford in 1995, Foot was head-hunted by a computer software company in the run-up to the dot-com bubble, however he loathed the industry: \"I had to read manuals on HTML and just write websites from scratch. None of us really knew what we were doing\". He started to pursue a career in comedy by doing open mic slots at various venues.\n\nHe is openly gay. He has been described as \"a little bit vegetarian\", but has said that occasionally he does return to eating meat due to nutrition-related health issues. He has stated on his video log that he has face blindness.\n\nFoot frequently performs live, with resident slots at various London comedy clubs, and his fans sometimes demand shows in particularly obscure parts of Britain. He usually takes a show to the Edinburgh Fringe such as \"By the Yard\" (2009), \"Ash in the Attic\" (2010) (which was directed by Noel Fielding) and \"Words \"(2013).\n\nFollowing Edinburgh, Foot usually tours Britain with his current show before taking it to Australia after Christmas for the Australian festival circuit. He has also given runs at Montreal Comedy festival as well as selling out at venues in Sweden.\n\nIn 2003, Foot and Russell Brand appeared in a double act at Cafe Royal. Foot's style of comedy had a strong influence on Brand, who was inspired by Foot's eccentric hair, quirky mannerisms and love for florid language. In \"The Guardian\", Paul MacInnes wrote about their similarities in an article that explored the notion of \"copycat comedians\". Bruce Dessau made similar observations in \"The Standard\".\n\nAlthough a sector of Foot's fan base felt Brand had stolen Foot's act, the two comedians have remained friends. In 2012, Brand made a special appearance at one of Foot's \"Secret Shows\" and they improvised a play in which Brand played Foot and Foot played actress Angela Lansbury.\n\n\nFoot's 2010 Edinburgh show \"Ash in the Attic\" was directed by comedian Noel Fielding and enjoyed two sell-out runs at London's Soho Theatre in February 2011. \"Ash in the Attic\" was then taken to Melbourne for the 2011 Melbourne International Comedy Festival as part of the official gala selection where it received a 5-star review in \"The Age\". Australian Chortle wrote in their review that \"Ash in the Attic\" was \"One of the best comedy shows ever to have been performed in Melbourne\". A CD of the show was released, and can be bought from his website, standard online shops, and from Foot at tour shows.\n\nFoot performed eight secret London previews for his 2011 Edinburgh show \"Still Life\" before taking it to the Fringe where the show had a sell-out run at the Underbelly. Foot toured the UK in autumn 2011 with \"Still Life\" starting at the Soho Theatre on 26 September. Foot took \"Still Life\" to the 2012 Melbourne International Comedy Festival where he starred in the Comedy Festival Gala on Australia's Network Ten and was nominated for a Barry Award. \"Still Life\" also featured at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal. The poster image for \"Still Life\" is an original artwork, a portrait of Foot amidst various fruits, by Victoria Brook.\n\nFoot's 2012 Edinburgh show was called \"Kenny Larch Is Dead\". As ever with Foot, the show had nothing to do with the title. Following the Fringe the sell-out show toured Britain, before being taken to the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. The show won the Best of Fest award at the Sydney Comedy festival, and Best International Show at the Perth comedy awards.\n\nIn September 2006, Foot started a regular London-based solo variety show called \"Paul Foot's Comedy for Connoisseurs\". The title comes from the name given to his fans, \"The Guild of Paul Foot Connoisseurs\", for whom Foot arranges \"secret\" events advertised only via his official website and mailing list. In the secret shows Foot often enters a surreal territory, taking on the personae of his own character creations such as \"Penny\" and \"Skeleton Johnson\", and sometimes improvising elaborate mini-dramas in which he plays all of the parts. Some of Foot's characters feature on his website which also has a secret page for his Guild of Connoisseurs.\n\nFoot's television appearances in 2010 introduced a new generation to his style of comedy, leading some \"Connoisseurs of The Guild of Paul Foot Connoisseurs\" unable to attend Foot's Secret Shows due to this new wave of popularity with a younger, student demographic booking them out. Foot addressed this problem by organising his first \"Secret Secret Show\" for his longest-serving fans. The show was not advertised anywhere on his website.\n\nIn 2009, Paul Foot hosted his own all-day festival at Bethnal Green Working Men's Club in East London with the help of arts and music collective HungaMunga. Sketches included 'Foot of the Yard', a whodunnit, an Invisible Man Contest, Flamingo I-Spy, an Erotic Menu, and Paul's Rants. HungaMunga provided lots of arts and crafts materials and activities. Foot also painted portraits of members of the audience. The festival also included Paul's Protégé's featuring the comedians Tom Bell and Joel Dommett. Musical performers at the festival were Birmingham gonzo-ska band Misty's Big Adventure and Antony Elvin.\n\nFoot has appeared on numerous television shows including:\n\nIn 2008, Foot was a finalist in NBC's \"Last Comic Standing\".\n\nIn 2011, Foot filmed a series of TV advertisements for Virgin Mobile in Australia. He helped to devise his character in the campaign called \"Robin Da Hood\", a bizarre fusion of medieval eccentricities and modern-day Australian urbanity. The first of these adverts featured an emergency phone conversation between Foot and head of the Virgin Group Sir Richard Branson.\n\nIn 1997, Foot won both the BBC New Stand-up Award and the \"Daily Telegraph\" Open Mic Award, and was a finalist for the So You Think You're Funny award for newcomers. In 1998, he was nominated for the Perrier Best Newcomer Award in Edinburgh.\n\nIn 2011, Foot was nominated for a Barry Award at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.\nIn 2012, Foot was nominated again for a Barry Award at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.\nIn 2013, Foot won the top award at the Sydney Comedy festival for Kenny Larch Is Dead, which won the best show award.\n\nSince 2009, Foot has released a podcast, the \"Paul Foot Podcast\". It was originally the highlights from his show on Resonance FM, and featured fellow stand-up comedian Joel Dommett, among other regulars. After the Resonance FM show ended, a few episodes were released independently up to May 2010. Episodes of the podcast then became more sporadic, being released every few months or so; these episodes included guests such as Trevor Lock and Paul's tour support act Malcolm Head, as well as recordings from Paul's Secret Shows. Starting in 2015, the podcast started being released far more regularly once again, with another stand-up comedian, Tom Mayhew, as co-host.\n\nHe commands a significant cult following called \"The Guild of Connoisseurs\".\nAs well as secret stand-up comedy shows Foot arranges events for The Guild of Connoisseurs such as secret picnics, spoof lectures and guided tours. In July 2011 he scheduled an event at Stepney City Farm at which connoisseurs attempted to complete a 32,000 piece jigsaw puzzle.\n\nFoot hosts competitions within the Guild too, such as an annual tie design competition and portrait painting competitions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "204706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=204706", "title": "Reinhold Niebuhr", "text": "Reinhold Niebuhr\n\nKarl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr (; June 21, 1892June 1, 1971) was an American Reformed theologian, ethicist, commentator on politics and public affairs, and professor at Union Theological Seminary for more than 30 years. Niebuhr was one of America's leading public intellectuals for several decades of the 20th century and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. A public theologian, he wrote and spoke frequently about the intersection of religion, politics, and public policy, with his most influential books including \"Moral Man and Immoral Society\" and \"The Nature and Destiny of Man\". The latter is ranked #18 of the Top 100 non-fiction books of the twentieth century by Modern Library. Andrew Bacevich labelled Niebuhr's book \"The Irony of American History\" \"the most important book ever written on U.S. foreign policy.\" Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. described Niebuhr as \"the most influential American theologian of the 20th century\" and \"Time\" posthumously called Niebuhr \"the greatest Protestant theologian in America since Jonathan Edwards.\"\n\nStarting as a minister with working-class sympathies in the 1920s and sharing with many other ministers a commitment to pacifism and socialism, his thinking evolved during the 1930s to neo-orthodox realist theology as he developed the philosophical perspective known as Christian realism. He attacked utopianism as ineffectual for dealing with reality, writing in \"The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness\" (1944), \"Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.\" Niebuhr's realism deepened after 1945 and led him to support American efforts to confront Soviet communism around the world. A powerful speaker, he was one of the most influential thinkers of the 1940s and 1950s in public affairs. Niebuhr battled with religious liberals over what he called their naïve views of the contradictions of human nature and the optimism of the Social Gospel, and battled with the religious conservatives over what he viewed as their naïve view of scripture and their narrow definition of \"true religion\". During this time he was viewed by many as the intellectual rival of John Dewey.\n\nNiebuhr's contributions to political philosophy include utilizing the resources of theology to argue for political realism. His work has also significantly influenced international relations theory, leading many scholars to move away from idealism and embrace realism. A large number of scholars, including political scientists, political historians, and theologians, have noted his influence on their thinking. Aside from academics, numerous politicians, and activists such as former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama, and Jimmy Carter; Myles Horton, Martin Luther King Jr., Hillary Clinton, Hubert Humphrey, Dean Acheson, James Comey, Madeleine Albright, and John McCain have also cited his influence on their thought. Recent years have seen a renewed interest in Niebuhr's work, in part because of Obama's stated admiration for Niebuhr. In 2017, PBS released a documentary on Niebuhr, titled \"An American Conscience: The Reinhold Niebuhr Story.\"\n\nAside from his political commentary, Niebuhr is also known for having composed the Serenity Prayer, a widely-recited prayer which was popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous. Niebuhr was also one of the founders of both Americans for Democratic Action and the International Rescue Committee and also spent time at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, while serving as a visiting professor at both Harvard and Princeton. He was also the brother of another prominent theologian, H. Richard Niebuhr.\n\nNiebuhr was born in Wright City, Missouri, the son of German immigrants Gustav Niebuhr, and his wife, Lydia (née Hosto). His father was a German Evangelical pastor; his denomination was the American branch of the established Prussian Church Union in Germany. It is now part of the United Church of Christ. The family spoke German at home. His brother H. Richard Niebuhr also became a famous theological ethicist, and his sister Hulda Niebuhr became a divinity professor in Chicago. The Niebuhr family moved to Lincoln, Illinois, in 1902 when Gustav Niebuhr became pastor of Lincoln's St. John's German Evangelical Synod church. Reinhold Niebuhr first served as pastor of a church when he served from April to September 1913 as interim minister of St. John's following his father's death.\n\nNiebuhr attended Elmhurst College in Illinois and graduated in 1910. He studied at Eden Theological Seminary in Webster Groves, Missouri, where, as he admitted, he was deeply influenced by Samuel D. Press in \"biblical and systematic subjects\", and Yale Divinity School, where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1914 and a Master of Arts degree the following year. He always regretted not taking a doctorate. He said that Yale gave him intellectual liberation from the localism of his German-American upbringing.\n\nIn 1931 Niebuhr married Ursula Keppel-Compton. She was a member of the Church of England and was educated at Oxford University in theology and history. She met Niebuhr while studying for her master's degree at Union Theological Seminary. For many years, she was on faculty at Barnard College (the women's college of Columbia University) where she helped establish and then chaired the religious studies department. The Niebuhrs had two children, Christopher Niebuhr and Elisabeth Niebuhr Sifton. Ursula Niebuhr left evidence in her professional papers at the Library of Congress showing that she co-authored some of her husband's later writings.\n\nIn 1915, Niebuhr was ordained a pastor. The German Evangelical mission board sent him to serve at Bethel Evangelical Church in Detroit, Michigan. The congregation numbered sixty-six on his arrival and grew to nearly 700 by the time he left in 1928. The increase reflected his ability to reach people outside the German American community and among the growing population attracted to jobs in the booming automobile industry. In the early 1900s Detroit became the fourth-largest city in the country, attracting many black and white migrants from the rural South, as well as Jewish and Catholic ethnics from eastern and southern Europe. They competed for jobs and limited housing, and the city's rapid changes and rise in social tensions contributed to the growth in numbers of Ku Klux Klan members in the city, which reached its peak in 1925, and to the Black Legion. During that year's city election campaign, in which the Klan publicly supported several candidates, including for the office of mayor, Niebuhr spoke out publicly against the Klan to his congregation, describing them as \"one of the worst specific social phenomena which the religious pride of a people has ever developed\". Only one of their several candidates gained a seat on the city council, and Charles Bowles, the mayoral candidate, was defeated.\n\nAs America entered the World War in 1917, Niebuhr was the unknown pastor of a small German-speaking congregation in Detroit (it stopped using German in 1919). All German American culture in the United States and nearby Canada came under attack for suspicion of having dual loyalties. Niebuhr repeatedly stressed the need to be loyal to America, and won an audience in national magazines for his appeals to the German Americans to be patriotic. Theologically, he went beyond the issue of national loyalty as he endeavored to fashion a realistic ethical perspective of patriotism and pacifism. He endeavored to work out a realistic approach to the moral danger posed by aggressive powers, which many idealists and pacifists failed to recognize. During the war, he also served his denomination as Executive Secretary of the War Welfare Commission, while maintaining his pastorate in Detroit. A pacifist at heart, he saw compromise as a necessity and was willing to support war in order to find peace—compromising for the sake of righteousness.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to explicate the origins of Niebuhr's sympathies from the 1920s to working class and labor class issues as documented by his biographer Richard W. Fox. One supportive example has concerned his interest in the plight of auto workers in Detroit. This one interest among others can be briefly summarized below.\nAfter seminary, Niebuhr preached the Social Gospel, and then initiated the engagement of what he considered the insecurity of Ford workers. Niebuhr had moved to the left and was troubled by the demoralizing effects of industrialism on workers. He became an outspoken critic of Henry Ford and allowed union organizers to use his pulpit to expound their message of workers' rights. Niebuhr attacked poor conditions created by the assembly lines and erratic employment practices.\n\nBecause of his opinion about factory work, Niebuhr rejected liberal optimism. He wrote in his diary:\nWe went through one of the big automobile factories to-day... The foundry interested me particularly. The heat was terrific. The men seemed weary. Here manual labour is a drudgery and toil is slavery. The men cannot possibly find any satisfaction in their work. They simply work to make a living. Their sweat and their dull pain are part of the price paid for the fine cars we all run. And most of us run the cars without knowing what price is being paid for them... We are all responsible. We all want the things which the factory produces and none of us is sensitive enough to care how much in human values the efficiency of the modern factory costs.\n\nThe historian Ronald H. Stone thinks that Niebuhr never talked to the assembly line workers (many of his parishioners were skilled craftsmen) but projected feelings onto them after discussions with Rev. Samuel Marquis. Niebuhr's criticism of Ford and capitalism resonated with progressives and helped make him nationally prominent. His serious commitment to Marxism developed after he moved to New York in 1928.\n\nIn 1923, Niebuhr visited Europe to meet with intellectuals and theologians. The conditions he saw in Germany under the French occupation of the Rhineland dismayed him. They reinforced the pacifist views that he had adopted throughout the 1920s after World War I.\n\nNiebuhr captured his personal experiences in Detroit in his book \"Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic\". He continued to write and publish throughout his career, and also served as editor of the magazine \"Christianity and Crisis\" from 1941 through 1966.\n\nIn 1928, Niebuhr left Detroit to become Professor of Practical Theology at Union Theological Seminary in New York. He spent the rest of his career there, until retirement in 1960. While teaching theology at Union Theological Seminary, Niebuhr influenced many generations of students and thinkers, including the German minister Dietrich Bonhoeffer of the anti-Nazi Confessing Church.\n\nThe Fellowship of Socialist Christians was organized in the early 1930s by Niebuhr and others with similar views.\nLater it changed its name to Frontier Fellowship and then to Christian Action.\nThe main supporters of the Fellowship in the early days included Eduard Heimann, Sherwood Eddy, Paul Tillich and Rose Terlin. \nIn its early days the group thought capitalist individualism was incompatible with Christian ethics.\nAlthough not Communist, the group acknowledged Karl Marx's social philosophy.\nNiebuhr was among the group of 51 prominent Americans who formed the International Relief Association (IRA) that is today known as the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The committee mission was to assist Germans suffering from the policies of the Hitler regime.\n\nIn the 1930s Niebuhr was often seen as an intellectual opponent of John Dewey. Both men were professional polemicists and their ideas often clashed, although they contributed to the same realms of liberal intellectual schools of thought. Niebuhr was a strong proponent of the \"Jerusalem\" religious tradition as a corrective to the secular \"Athens\" tradition insisted upon by Dewey. In the book \"Moral Man and Immoral Society\" (1932), Niebuhr strongly criticized Dewey's philosophy, although his own ideas were still intellectually inchoate. Two years later, in a review of Dewey's book \"A Common Faith\" (1934), Niebuhr was calm and respectful towards Dewey's \"religious footnote\" on his then large body of educational and pragmatic philosophy.\n\nIn 1939 Niebuhr explained his theological odyssey:\nIn the 1930s Niebuhr worked out many of his ideas about sin and grace, love and justice, faith and reason, realism and idealism, and the irony and tragedy of history, which established his leadership of the neo-orthodox movement in theology. Influenced strongly by Karl Barth and other dialectical theologians of Europe, he began to emphasize the Bible as a human record of divine self-revelation; it offered for Niebuhr a critical but redemptive reorientation of the understanding of humanity's nature and destiny.\n\nNiebuhr couched his ideas in Christ-centered principles such as the Great Commandment and the doctrine of original sin. His major contribution was his view of sin as a social event—as pride—with selfish self-centeredness as the root of evil. The sin of pride was apparent not just in criminals, but more dangerously in people who felt good about their deeds—rather like Henry Ford (whom he did not mention by name). The human tendency to corrupt the good was the great insight he saw manifested in governments, business, democracies, utopian societies, and churches. This position is laid out profoundly in one of his most influential books, \"Moral Man and Immoral Society\" (1932). He was a debunker of hypocrisy and pretense and made the avoidance of self-righteous illusions the center of his thoughts.\n\nNiebuhr argued that to approach religion as the individualistic attempt to fulfill biblical commandments in a moralistic sense is not only an impossibility but also a demonstration of man's original sin, which Niebuhr interpreted as self-love. Through self-love man becomes focused on his own goodness and leaps to the false conclusion—one he called the \"Promethean illusion\"—that he can achieve goodness on his own. Thus man mistakes his partial ability to transcend himself for the ability to prove his absolute authority over his own life and world. Constantly frustrated by natural limitations, man develops a lust for power which destroys him and his whole world. History is the record of these crises and judgments which man brings on himself; it is also proof that God does not allow man to overstep his possibilities. In radical contrast to the Promethean illusion, God reveals himself in history, especially personified in Jesus Christ, as sacrificial love which overcomes the human temptation to self-deification and makes possible constructive human history.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Niebuhr was a prominent leader of the militant faction of the Socialist Party of America, although he disliked die-hard Marxists. He described their beliefs as a religion and a thin one at that. In 1941, he co-founded the Union for Democratic Action, a group with a strongly militarily interventionist, internationalist foreign policy and a pro-union, liberal domestic policy. He was the group's president until it transformed into the Americans for Democratic Action in 1947.\n\nWithin the framework of Christian realism, Niebuhr became a supporter of American action in World War II, anti-communism, and the development of nuclear weapons. However, he opposed the Vietnam War.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, the pacifist component of his liberalism was challenged. Niebuhr began to distance himself from the pacifism of his more liberal colleagues and became a staunch advocate for the war. Niebuhr soon left the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a peace-oriented group of theologians and ministers, and became one of their harshest critics.\n\nThis departure from his peers evolved into a movement known as Christian realism. Niebuhr is widely considered to have been its primary advocate. Niebuhr supported the Allies during World War II and argued for the engagement of the United States in the war. As a writer popular in both the secular and the religious arena and a professor at the Union Theological Seminary, he was very influential both in the United States and abroad. While many clergy proclaimed themselves pacifists because of their World War I experiences, Niebuhr declared that a victory by Germany and Japan would threaten Christianity. He renounced his socialist connections and beliefs and resigned from the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation. He based his arguments on the Protestant beliefs that sin is part of the world, that justice must take precedence over love, and that pacifism is a symbolic portrayal of absolute love but cannot prevent sin. Although his opponents did not portray him favorably, Niebuhr's exchanges with them on the issue helped him mature intellectually.\n\nNiebuhr debated Charles Clayton Morrison, editor of \"The Christian Century\" magazine, about America's entry into World War II. Morrison and his pacifistic followers maintained that America's role should be strictly neutral and part of a negotiated peace only, while Niebuhr claimed himself to be a realist, who opposed the use of political power to attain moral ends. Morrison and his followers strongly supported the movement to outlaw war that began after World War I and the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. The pact was severely challenged by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. With his publication of \"Moral Man and Immoral Society\" (1932), Niebuhr broke ranks with \"The Christian Century\" and supported interventionism and power politics. He supported the reelection of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 and published his own magazine, \"Christianity and Crisis\". In 1945, however, Niebuhr charged that use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was \"morally indefensible\".\n\nArthur M. Schlesinger Jr. explained Niebuhr's influence:\nTraditionally, the idea of the frailty of man led to the demand for obedience to ordained authority. But Niebuhr rejected that ancient conservative argument. Ordained authority, he showed, is all the more subject to the temptations of self-interest, self-deception and self-righteousness. Power must be balanced by power. He persuaded me and many of my contemporaries that original sin provides a far stronger foundation for freedom and self-government than illusions about human perfectibility. Niebuhr's analysis was grounded in the Christianity of Augustine and Calvin, but he had, nonetheless, a special affinity with secular circles. His warnings against utopianism, messianism and perfectionism strike a chord today... We cannot play the role of God to history, and we must strive as best we can to attain decency, clarity and proximate justice in an ambiguous world.\n\nNiebuhr's defense of Roosevelt made him popular among liberals, as the historian Morton White noted:\nThe contemporary liberal's fascination with Niebuhr, I suggest, comes less from Niebuhr's dark theory of human nature and more from his actual political pronouncements, from the fact that he is a shrewd, courageous, and right-minded man on many political questions. Those who applaud his politics are too liable to turn then to his theory of human nature and praise it as the philosophical instrument of Niebuhr's political agreement with themselves. But very few of those whom I have called \"atheists for Niebuhr\" follow this inverted logic to its conclusion: they don't move from praise of Niebuhr's theory of human nature to praise of its theological ground. We may admire them for drawing the line somewhere, but certainly not for their consistency.\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Adolf Hitler in August 1939, Niebuhr severed his past ties with any fellow-traveler organization having any known Communist leanings. In 1947, Niebuhr helped found the liberal Americans for Democratic Action (ADA). His ideas influenced George Kennan, Hans Morgenthau, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and other realists during the Cold War on the need to contain Communist expansion.\n\nIn his last cover story for \"Time\" magazine (March 1948), Whittaker Chambers said of Niebuhr:\n\nMost U.S. liberals think of Niebuhr as a solid socialist who has some obscure connection with Union Theological Seminary that does not interfere with his political work. Unlike most clergymen in politics, Dr. Niebuhr is a pragmatist. Says James Loeb, secretary of Americans for Democratic Action: \"Most so-called liberals are idealists. They let their hearts run away with their heads. Niebuhr never does. For example, he has always been the leading liberal opponent of pacifism. In that period before we got into the war when pacifism was popular, he held out against it steadfastly. He is also an opponent of Marxism.\n\nIn the 1950s, Niebuhr described Senator Joseph McCarthy as a force of evil, not so much for attacking civil liberties, as for being ineffective in rooting out Communists and their sympathizers. In 1953, he supported the execution of the Rosenbergs, saying, \"Traitors are never ordinary criminals and the Rosenbergs are quite obviously fiercely loyal Communists... Stealing atomic secrets is an unprecedented crime.\"\n\nHis views developed during his pastoral tenure in Detroit, which had become a place of immigration, migration, competition and development as a major industrial city. During the 1920s, Niebuhr spoke out against the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in Detroit, which had recruited many members threatened by the rapid social changes. The Klan proposed positions that were anti-black, anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic. Niebuhr's preaching against the Klan, especially in relation to the 1925 mayoral election, gained him national attention.\n\nNiebuhr's thoughts on racial justice developed slowly after he abandoned socialism. Niebuhr attributed the injustices of society to human pride and self-love and believed that this innate propensity for evil could not be controlled by humanity. But, he believed that a representative democracy could improve society's ills. Like Edmund Burke, Niebuhr endorsed natural evolution over imposed change and emphasized experience over theory. Niebuhr's Burkean ideology, however, often conflicted with his liberal principles, particularly regarding his perspective on racial justice. Though vehemently opposed to racial inequality, Niebuhr adopted a conservative position on segregation.\n\nWhile after World War II most liberals endorsed integration, Niebuhr focused on achieving equal opportunity. He warned against imposing changes that could result in violence. The violence that followed peaceful demonstrations in the 1960s forced Niebuhr to reverse his position against imposed equality; witnessing the problems of the Northern ghettos later caused him to doubt that equality was attainable.\n\nAnti-Catholicism surged in Detroit in the 1920s in reaction to the rise in the number of Catholic immigrants from southern Europe since the early 20th century. It was exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan, which recruited many members in Detroit. Niebuhr defended pluralism by attacking the Klan. During the Detroit mayoral election of 1925, Niebuhr's sermon, \"We fair-minded Protestants cannot deny\", was published on the front pages of both the \"Detroit Times\" and the \"Free Press\".\n\nThis sermon urged people to vote against mayoral candidate Charles Bowles, who was being openly endorsed by the Klan. The Catholic incumbent, John W. Smith, won by a narrow 30,000 votes. Niebuhr preached against the Klan and helped to influence its decline in political power in Detroit. Niebuhr preached:\nIn the \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, \"Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.\" King drew more heavily upon Niebuhr's social and ethical ideals than on anyone else (including Gandhi). King invited Niebuhr to participate in the third Selma to Montgomery March in 1965, and Niebuhr responded by telegram: \"Only a severe stroke prevents me from accepting ... I hope there will be a massive demonstration of all the citizens with conscience in favor of the elemental human rights of voting and freedom of assembly\" (Niebuhr, March 19, 1965). Two years later, Niebuhr defended King's decision to speak out against the Vietnam War, calling him \"one of the greatest religious leaders of our time\". Niebuhr asserted: \"Dr. King has the right and a duty, as both a religious and a civil rights leader, to express his concern in these days about such a major human problem as the Vietnam War.\" Of his country's intervention in Vietnam, Niebuhr admitted: \"For the first time I fear I am ashamed of our beloved nation.\"\n\nAs a young pastor in Detroit, he favored conversion of Jews to Christianity, scolding evangelical Christians who were anti-Semitic or ignoring them. He spoke out against \"the unchristlike attitude of Christians\", and what he described as his fellow Christians' \"Jewish bigotry\". His 1933 article in the \"Christian Century\" was an attempt to sound the alarm within the Christian community over Hitler's \"cultural annihilation of the Jews\". Eventually, his theology evolved to the point where he was the first prominent Christian theologian to argue it was inappropriate for Christians to seek to convert Jews to their faith.\n\nAs a preacher, writer, leader, and adviser to political figures, Niebuhr supported Zionism and the development of Israel. His solution to anti-Semitism was a combination of a Jewish homeland, greater tolerance, and assimilation in other countries. As early as 1942, he advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Palestine and their resettlement in other Arab countries. His position may have related to his religious conviction that life on earth is imperfect, and his concern about German anti-Semitism.\n\nIn 1952, Niebuhr published \"The Irony of American History\", in which he interpreted the meaning of the United States' past. Niebuhr questioned whether a humane, \"ironical\" interpretation of American history was credible on its own merits, or only in the context of a Christian view of history. Niebuhr's concept of irony referred to situations in which \"the consequences of an act are diametrically opposed to the original intention\", and \"the fundamental cause of the disparity lies in the actor himself, and his original purpose.\" His reading of American history based on this notion, though from the Christian perspective, is so rooted in historical events that readers who do not share his religious views can be led to the same conclusion. Niebuhr's great foe was idealism. American idealism, he believed, comes in two forms: the idealism of the antiwar non-interventionists, who are embarrassed by power; and the idealism of pro-war imperialists, who disguise power as virtue. He said the non-interventionists, without mentioning Harry Emerson Fosdick by name, seek to preserve the purity of their souls, either by denouncing military actions or by demanding that every action taken be unequivocally virtuous. They exaggerate the sins committed by their own country, excuse the malevolence of its enemies and, as later polemicists have put it, inevitably blame America first. Niebuhr argued this approach was a pious way to refuse to face real problems.\n\nNiebuhr claimed he wrote the short \"Serenity Prayer\". Fred R. Shapiro, who had cast doubts on Niebuhr's claim, conceded in 2009 that, \"The new evidence does not prove that Reinhold Niebuhr wrote [the prayer], but it does significantly improve the likelihood that he was the originator.\" The earliest known version of the prayer, from 1937, attributes the prayer to Niebuhr in this version:\n\n\"Father, give us courage to change what must be altered, serenity to accept what cannot be helped, and the insight to know the one from the other.\"\n\nThe most popular version, the authorship of which is unknown, reads:\n\nMany political scientists, such as George F. Kennan, Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, and Samuel P. Huntington and political historians, such as Richard Hofstadter, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and Christopher Lasch, have noted his influence on their thinking. \n\nNiebuhr exerted a significant influence upon mainline Protestant clergy in the years immediately following World War II, much of it in concord with the neo-orthodox and the related movements. That influence began to wane and then drop toward the end of his life.\n\nThe historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in the late twentieth century described the legacy of Niebuhr as being contested between American liberals and conservatives, both of whom wanted to claim him. Martin Luther King Jr. gave credit to Niebuhr's influence. Foreign-policy conservatives point to Niebuhr's support of the containment doctrine during the Cold War as an instance of moral realism; progressives cite his later opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nIn more recent years, Niebuhr has enjoyed something of a renaissance in contemporary thought, although usually not in liberal Protestant theological circles. Both major-party candidates in the 2008 presidential election cited Niebuhr as an influence: Senator John McCain, in his book \"Hard Call\", \"celebrated Niebuhr as a paragon of clarity about the costs of a good war\". President Barack Obama said that Niebuhr was his \"favorite philosopher\" and \"favorite theologian\". \"Slate\" magazine columnist Fred Kaplan characterized Obama's 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech a \"faithful reflection\" of Niebuhr.\n\nKenneth Waltz's seminal work on international relations theory, \"Man, the State, and War\", includes many references to Niebuhr's thought. Waltz emphasizes Niebuhr's contributions to political realism, especially \"the impossibility of human perfection\". Andrew Bacevich's book \"The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism\" refers to Niebuhr 13 times. Bacevich emphasises Niebuhr's humility and his belief that Americans were in danger of becoming enamored of U.S. power.\n\nOther leaders of American foreign policy in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century have acknowledged Niebuhr's importance to them, including Jimmy Carter, Madeleine Albright, and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\nNiebuhr's influence was at its peak during the first two decades of the Cold War. By the 1970s, his influence was declining because of the rise of liberation theology, antiwar sentiment, the growth of conservative evangelicalism, and postmodernism. According to historian Gene Zubovich, \"It took the tragic events of September 11, 2001, to revive Niebuhr.\"\n\nIn spring of 2017, it was speculated (and later confirmed) that former FBI director James Comey used Niebuhr's name as a screen name for his personal Twitter account. Comey, as a religion major at the College of William & Mary, wrote his undergraduate thesis on Niebuhr and televangelist Jerry Falwell.\n\nNiebuhr was often described as a charismatic speaker. The journalist Alden Whitman wrote of his speaking style:\nHe possessed a deep voice and large blue eyes. He used his arms as though he were an orchestra conductor. Occasionally one hand would strike out, with a pointed finger at the end, to accent a trenchant sentence. He talked rapidly and (because he disliked to wear spectacles for his far-sightedness) without notes; yet he was adroit at building logical climaxes and in communicating a sense of passionate involvement in what he was saying.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42912600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42912600", "title": "Walther Poppelreuter", "text": "Walther Poppelreuter\n\nWalther Poppelreuter (also incorrectly written in the literature \"Walther Poppelreuther\" and \"Walter Poppelreuter\"; born October 8, 1886 in Saarbrücken; died June 11, 1939 in Bonn) was a German psychologist and neurologist. He dealt mainly with brain injuries of soldiers during the First World War and developed psychometric examination procedures that were used in the treatment of brain-injured patients and in industrial aptitude tests. He was among the first high school teachers who advocated openly for Nazism before the \"seizure of power\" (Machtergreifung). His psychometric tests are often used in visual neuropsychology, especially the Poppelreuter figure visual perceptual function test.\n\nThe son of a high school director, Poppelreuter studied philosophy with a special emphasis on experimental psychology in Berlin and received his doctorate in 1908 in Königsberg. He then studied medicine and graduated in 1914. He came on as assistant to Gustav Aschaffenburg at the Psychiatric Hospital of Cologne, which during the First World War was the Cologne fortress hospital for head injuries.\n\nIn 1919, Poppelreuter moved to Bonn and became head of the newly founded \"Institute for Applied Psychology\" - trade station for German brain-injured war victims. In 1922, he received a position at the University of Bonn as an associate professor of clinical psychology. Poppelreuter's work on brain injury gave him high professional recognition. He developed a series of psychometric examination methods that were used in industrial psychology and vocational counseling. His clinical interest was given to the possible treatment of neuropsychological dysfunction.\n\nAgainst his resistance Poppelreuter's \"Brain-Injured Institute\" moved in 1925 to Düsseldorf; however, it had been vacant since 1924. Poppelreuter had given himself a sabbatical in 1923/24 and turned to ergonomic issues at Gelsenkirchen mine association. In 1925, he became head of the Institute of Work Psychology at RWTH Aachen University and founded in 1928 on Adolf Wallichs guided Chair for teaching a laboratory for industrial psycho-technique. Here he continued the experience he had gained from the inclusion of war-disabled in the rationalization of work processes in order.\n\nIn the winter semester 1931/32 he held a series of lectures on political psychology as applied psychology on the basis of Hitler's book \"Mein Kampf\", which he in 1934 under the title Hitler, the political psychologist published. Hitler had told him in July 1932 in writing his joy that the first time his book will issue a lecture at a university.\n\nIn the Nazi period, Poppelreuter operated as a consultant of the National Socialist German Institute for Technical Work Research and Training in Düsseldorf. In Bonn, he served as Deputy Chairman of Psychology at the German Society. Shortly before his death, occupational and partisan judicial proceedings had been initiated against him for alcohol abuse and reprehensible means in a divorce dispute.\n\nPoppelreuter's Law is a law of physiological training that states that when teaching a skill requiring both speed and accuracy, it is better in the early stages to limit speed and practice until a certain degree of accuracy has been attained, and then gradually increase the speed.\n\nThe law was invented and so named by Walther Poppelreuter in 1922. Subsequent research has invalidated the law, indicating that the neuromuscular patterns between the same activity performed slow and fast oftentimes are completely different and therefore unable to be trained simultaneously.\n\nPoppelreuter invented the overlapping figures test in 1917 as one method of assessing brain injury incurred during World War I. It is typical for people with apperceptive agnosia to have difficulty with the overlapping figures, but not for people with associative visual agnosia.\n\nThe Walther-Poppelreuter Medal was named in his honor. In addition, houses and streets were named after him. Poppelreuter's Nazi past was only noticed by the publication of a book on child euthanasia in the Bonn children's institution in the public consciousness. In 1990, Hannelore Kohl returned the Poppelreuter medal conferred in 1986. \n\nIn the district of Cologne Ostheim, there was a Poppelreuter Street since 1957. Due to Poppelreuter's involvement in Nazism, the road was renamed Josef-Poppelreuter Street, after the first director of the Roman division of the Wallraf-Richartz Museum.\n"}

After 1945 he returned to Izhevsk and joined the Arms Design Bureau, working as a project engineer on sporting and civilian target rifles through the 1950s. One of these, the Biathlon target rifle, went on to the Olympic Gold. In 1959 Dragunov submitted his design for a military sniping rifle, the SVD, which was accepted into Soviet military service in 1963, and later became known as the Dragunov rifle.\n\nDragunov also participated in the competition that led to the adoption of AKS-74U with a gas-operated design called MA (malokalibrenii avtomat). Although Dragunov's avtomat was comparable in performance to Kalashnikov's, the latter had the advantage that it shared some parts with the AK-74 rifle already in production. The non-metallic parts of the MA were made of polyamides. The MA was Dragunov's last major design. The trigger mechanism used in the MA was fairly similar to the one previously used in the PP-71 sub-machine gun, which is also attributed to Dragunov.\n\nDragunov was awarded the Lenin Prize and the State Prize of the Russian Federation, the latter one posthumously.\n\n\n"}
