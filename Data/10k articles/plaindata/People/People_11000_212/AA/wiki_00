{"id": "3627510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3627510", "title": "Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol", "text": "Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol\n\nAlexandru Dimitrie Xenopol (; March 23, 1847, Iaşi – February 27, 1920, Bucharest) was a Romanian historian, philosopher, professor, economist, sociologist, and author. Among his many major accomplishments, he is the Romanian historian credited with authoring the first major synthesis of the history of the Romanian people.\n\nBorn in Iaşi, where he graduated from high school, he went on to Vienna in 1870 to study law and then to Berlin, where he studied philosophy. In 1868, he made his debut in \"Convorbiri Literare\" with a series of studies on Romanian traditions and on Romanian institutions.\n\nAt first, Xenopol served as a prosecutor in Iaşi, but he later decided to dedicate himself to the study of history. Starting in 1883, he was a professor of universal history at the University of Iaşi, where he served as rector from 1898 to 1901. He was elected member of the Romanian Academy in 1893.\n\nIn his 1899 French-language \"Les Principes fondamentaux de l'histoire\" (\"The Fundamental Principles of History\"), his work most well-known internationally, he argued for history being a true science which follows clearly defined laws and logic, through which the reasons for historical processes could be clearly defined.\n\nHis six-volume \"Istoria românilor din Dacia-Traiană\" (\"The History of the Romanians in Trajan's Dacia\"), completed between 1888 and 1893, strongly asserts that the Romanians are of predominantly Roman origin - a position further elaborated by the historian Nicolae Iorga, one of Xenopol's numerous pupils (see Origin of the Romanians).\n\nConcerning events nearly two millennia in the past and being supported by multiple archaeological findings, it was still contested by some historians. It had, however, very concrete political implications - the Roman origin implying that Romanians are inherently different from their Slavic and Magyar neighbors. This, despite his disagreement with radical nationalists and objection to violence against Jews, unfortunately also translated to Xenopol being a noted anti-Semite and collaborator of A. C. Cuza. Though he died before the formation of the Iron Guard, Romania's notorious Fascist party, he is considered to be one of its sources of inspiration - according to the final report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9599897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9599897", "title": "Anna LoPizzo", "text": "Anna LoPizzo\n\nAnna LoPizzo was a striker killed during the Lawrence Textile Strike (also known as the Bread and Roses Strike), considered one of the most significant struggles in U.S. labor history. Eugene Debs said of the strike, \"The Victory at Lawrence was the most decisive and far-reaching ever won by organized labor.\" Author Peter Carlson saw this strike conducted by the militant Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as a turning point. He wrote, \"Wary of [a war with the anti-capitalist IWW], some mill owners swallowed their hatred of unions and actually \"invited\" the AFL to organize their workers.\n\nAnna LoPizzo's death was significant to both sides in the struggle. Wrote Bruce Watson in his epic \"Bread and Roses: Mills, Migrants, and the Struggle for the American Dream\", \"If America had a Tomb of the Unknown Immigrant paying tribute to the millions of immigrants known only to God and distant cousins compiling family trees, Anna LoPizzo would be a prime candidate to lie in it.\"\n\nArdis Cameron describes the immigrant's world in which Anna LoPizzo lived:\n\nRelying on old-world practices and principles of collectivity, the immigrant community routinely \"swapped\" names and falsified documents to evade \"impossible\" laws and ensure mutual survival...\nFalsification of documents might serve a number of purposes — citizenship status, job experience, age requirements...\n\n[In America immigrants often] took the name of the person who got [them] the job. To those who lived on Common Street [in Lawrence, Massachusetts], Anna LoPizzo, a slain mill worker during the strike of 1912, was Anna LaMonica, once too young to work.\n\nUpon her death, Anna's adopted name was destined to become the name by which she would be known for all time.\n\nFred Thompson's book \"The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years\" states that, \n\nOn Jan. 29 a peaceful parade of the strikers was charged by the militia, and officer Oscar Benoit firing into the crowd, hit striker Anna Lo Pezza (sic), killing her. \n\nIn his autobiography Big Bill Haywood wrote that,\n\n...nineteen witnesses had seen Policeman Benoit murder the girl.\nIn the book \"Roughneck\", Peter Carlson has written,\n\nAt the barricades, pickets and police began to push and shove each other. The police advanced, packing the retreating marchers so tight that they could no longer move, and then began clubbing. Some strikers fought back. A policeman received a stab wound. A police sergeant ordered his men to draw their weapons and fire. Their shots killed a young Italian striker named Anna LoPizzo.\nThe IWW offered its own account a year after the strike, based upon trial proceedings:\n\n[On] January 29, a striker, Annie LoPizzo, was killed on the corner of Union and Garden Streets, during police and military interference with lawful picketing. She was shot by a bullet said to have been fired by Police Officer Oscar Benoit, though Benoit and Police Officer Marshall claim it was fired from behind Benoit by a personal enemy of the latter, following an altercation. Be that as it may, both Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti were arrested; charged with inciting and procuring the commission of the crime in [pursuit] of an unlawful conspiracy. Though the murderer was unknown, they were held as \"accessories before the fact.\nEttor and Giovannitti were IWW organizers arrested for the murder.\n\nThe testimony of Officers Benoit and Marshall showed that the fatal shot had been fired at Benoit by a man who had a personal grudge against Benoit, and who took advantage of the troublous times to square accounts... Other testimony showed Officer Benoit to be the killer of Annie Lo Pizzo.\nA third man was arrested for the murder; however,\n\nThree witnesses—his landlord, his child's god-father and his wife—helped Caruso to establish a complete alibi; he was at home eating supper when Annie Lo Pizzo was alleged to have been shot by him... Caruso said he was not a member of the I.W.W., but would join as soon as he got out [of the jail].\n\nLawrence, Massachusetts was home to many textile mills which relied heavily upon immigrant labor. According to Carlson the strike was \"a spontaneous revolt by immigrants who had arrived in Lawrence expecting a land of opportunity, but found instead a claustrophobic life of hard work and low pay.\" Carlson continues,\n\n\"It is obvious,\" the State Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded in 1911, \"that the full-time earnings of a large number of adult employees are entirely inadequate for a family.\" Consequently, the average Lawrence family sent mother, father, and all children over the legal minimum age of fourteen to work. The dirty, crowded mills were breeding grounds for disease. Tuberculosis and other respiratory ailments killed some 70 percent of the city's mill workers. \"A considerable number of the boys and girls die within the first two or three years after beginning work,\" wrote Dr. Elizabeth Shapleigh, a Lawrence physician. \"Thirty-six of every 100 of all men and women who work in the mills die before or by the time they are 25 years of age.\" ... While the mill hands lived and died in poverty, their employers thrived.\nThe Industrial Workers of the World already had a significant presence in the Lawrence mills. Fred Thompson has written,\n\nA persistent myth about the IWW is that it plunged into strikes without previous organization, bringing out contented workers with spell-binding oratory, won great victories, then deserted the workers to repeat the process elsewhere. The myth is groundless... Prior to its fame at Lawrence the IWW had been organizing textile workers for seven years, and these constituted roughly half of its membership.\n\nThe IWW's national organizers became involved when the Italian immigrant community in Lawrence sent a telegram to organizer Joseph Ettor. Ettor was an Italian and, at age 27, already a veteran organizer for the IWW.\n\nHaywood wrote in his autobiography that there were about twenty-eight different nationalities among the strikers, and they spoke forty-five different dialects. (Thompson reported 16 \"major\" languages.)\n\nEttor and fellow organizer Arturo Giovannitti had successfully organized the strike by the time chief IWW organizer Bill Haywood arrived. Within a month of walking out of the mills, there were twenty-five thousand workers participating in the strike. Haywood was sufficiently impressed that he thought it appropriate to leave the strike in the hands of his experienced organizers, and go on a speaking tour of northeastern U.S. cities in support of the strike.\n\nThe death of Anna LoPizzo was used by the authorities during the Lawrence Strike as a means of disrupting and pressuring the union. Although union leaders Ettor and Giovannitti were two miles away at the time of her death, they were charged with her murder and imprisoned without bail until trial. Bill Haywood cut short his tour, and returned to take control of the strike effort.\n\nThe trial of Caruso, Ettor and Giovannitti was held on September 30, keeping the two capable and multi-lingual organizers out of action for eight months. At trial, Ettor and Giovannitti were locked in metal cages. The district attorney referred to them as \"social vultures\" and \"labor buzzards.\" Yet they were not accused of the murder for which they were arrested. All three were acquitted.\n\nAnna LoPizzo's death on the picket line had given the authorities a chance to remove the two main organizers from action for the duration of the strike, but it also became a rallying cry for the workers to demand justice. The March 10–17, 1999 issue of \"Metro Santa Cruz\" offers an example of how the strikers reacted. An excerpt:\n\nThe strike was successful because the workers stayed united in their demands. Business writers began to question employers' and the local authorities' tactics relating not only to the strike, but specifically relating to the handling of Anna LoPizzo's death. One writer concerned about the success of the IWW's organizing tactics was Arno Dosch, who wrote in the magazine \"The World's Work\",\n\nThe efforts that have been made by employers and by governmental authorities to repress the movement have been worse than useless. Every move that has been made against the I. W. W. has had the effect of winning sympathy... The trial of the three agitators, Mr. Ettor, Mr. Giovannitti, and Mr. Caruso, for the murder of a woman whose death was indirectly due to the strike, was a tactical error. Mr. Ettor won the support of millions of people when he said, \" I have been tried here not for my acts, but for my views.\n\nBefore the Lawrence Strike and the trial for the death of Anna LoPizzo, many businessmen categorically refused to recognize any unions. After the strike, the American Federation of Labor was courted by some employers, if only as a bulwark against the radical and militant Industrial Workers of the World.\n\nCarlson records,\n\nShortly after the Lawrence strike, John Golden, president of the AFL's United Textile Workers union (a rival to the IWW's organizing efforts in Lawrence), observed that frightened mill owners \"are falling all over themselves now to do business with our organization.\" Lincoln Steffens summed up the attitude of the panicky mill bosses. \"Haywood makes Gompers look like an angel,\" he wrote. \"The IWW makes the millmen sigh for the AFL.\"\nThe foreboding on the part of employers resulted from their fears about what this new labor organization, the IWW, actually represented. Thompson quoted Harry Fosdick in the June issue of \"Outlook\" in 1912,\n\nWages have been raised, work has been resumed, the militia has gone, and the whirring looms suggest industrial peace; but behind all this the most revolutionary organization in the history of American industry is building up an army of volunteers. The I.W.W. leaves behind as hopelessly passé, the methods of the American Federation of Labor.\n\nSome believed that the success of the strikers called for other measures. Fosdick quoted a Boston lawyer who stated,\n\nThe strike should have been stopped in the first twenty-four hours. The militia should have been instructed to shoot. That is the way Napoleon did it.\n\nNews item (excerpt):\n\nOctober 2, 2000 — A MARKER FOR A MARTYR — Anna Lopizzo was killed Jan. 28, 1912, at age 34, shot through the heart during the Bread and Roses strike in Lawrence, Mass., when more than 30,000 laborers were on strike for 63 days against American Woolen Co., after management cut wages. Her grave was unmarked for 88 years, until David R. Morris, assistant business manager of Electrical Workers Local 2321 in North Andover, set about getting a headstone made. Granite cutters in Barre, Vt., where children of the strikers were taken for safety in 1912, donated a headstone carved with the Bread and Roses symbol — grain stalks and a rose. The gravestone was displayed at Lawrence Heritage State Park as part of the annual Bread and Roses festival until Labor Day and placed on her grave in ceremonies held Sept. 14.\n\n"}

He was a member of the Manouchian Group of the FTP-MOI, a wing of the larger Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) composed of fighters of foreign immigrant origin. Tchakarian was the last surviving member of the Manouchian Group (\"Groupe Manouchian\"), a Paris-based resistance cell led by Missak Manouchian.\n\nTchakarian was born to an ethnic Armenian family in Sapanca, the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey) on December 21, 1916. The family fled to Bulgaria to escape the Armenian Genocide during World War I. Tchakarian arrived in France in 1930 with his family and settled permanently in the country. He worked as a tailor.\n\nIn 1937, Tchakarian was conscripted into the French Army, where he served until 1940. He was discharged from the Army in 1940 following the defeat and occupation of France by Nazi Germany. He then became active in the nascent French resistance.\n\nIn 1942, Tchakarian joined the Manouchian Group, a small armed group within the larger FTP-MOI that was composed primarily of immigrant and foreign-origin resistance fighters. The group was commanded by Missak Manouchian, an ethnic Armenian communist and poet. In addition to Armenians, like himself, the Manouchian Group contained immigrants and refugees from other countries invaded by Nazi Germany, as well as Jews. According to Tchakarian, immigrants from fascist countries and those occupied by Nazi Germany were drawn to the resistance and cells like the Manouchian Group, \"They were immigrants who had come from countries that were becoming fascist, like Hungary, Romania, Poland, Bulgaria...From all those countries, there were immigrants who were kind of hunted out.\"\n\nTogether, the Manouchian Group, which were base in the Paris region, carried out resistance attacks, assassinations, and acts of sabotage across the country. In 1944, German authorities captured 23 Manouchian members, including their leader, Missak Manouchian. The members were sentenced to death and executed following a high-profile show trial. Following their executions, German and Vichy French authorities launched a propaganda campaign against the Manouchian Group. Red posters, which became infamously known as \"Affiche Rouge\", were hung in Paris during the spring of 1944. The Affiche Rouge depicted the Manouchian Group and its members as \"the army of crime\" in a bid to turn French public opinion against the resistance.\n\nUnlike his 23 Manouchian colleagues, Tchakarian managed to escape capture and execution in 1944. He fled to Bordeaux, where he was hidden by other French resistance members. However, he remained an active resistance member until the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nIn 1950, Arsène Tchakarian moved to the Parisian suburb of Vitry-sur-Seine, where he lived until his death in 2018. Tchakarian was granted French citizenship in 1958.\n\nTchakarian became a respected historian in the decades following World War II. His writings focused on the Armenian Genocide and French history. Tchakarian campaigned for the international recognition of the Armenian Genocide, from which he and his family had fled as refugees. He visited schools and universities to speak about his experiences during the genocide in the Ottoman Empire and the Nazi German occupation of France. Additionally, Tchakarian authored several memoirs.\n\nThe French newspaper \"Le Figaro\" quoted Tchakarian as saying, \"I'm sort of the last of the Mohicans, as they say,\" as he noted that he was one of the last surviving members of the FTP-MOI and the resistance.\n\nIn 2012, French President Nicolas Sarkozy awarded him the Legion of Honor. Most recently, Tchakarian attended a ceremony in commoration of the French Resistance on June 18, 2018.\n\nArsène Tchakarian, the last surviving member of the Manouchian Group, died at the Hôpital Paul-Brousse in Villejuif, France, on August 4, 2018, at the age of 101. In a Twitter post, French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to his time in the resistance and work as a historian, calling Tchakarian \"a hero of the resistance and a tireless witness whose voice resounded with force until the end.\"\n"}

One voyage in May of 1638 carried 61 settlers from Southampton, England, leaving before 12 May 1638 in which they were “some Dayes gone to sea”, to \"Newengland\", all one word. The ship's passenger destinations included: Newbury, Weymouth, Wells, Maine, Newport, Salisbury, and Charlestown.\n\nNo verified details of this merchant ship, its age or fate is known other than \"Beuis(t) of Hampton of CL. Tonnes\". This translates to “Bevis of Hampton, 150 tons.” The (t) was actually a footnote reference symbol in the form of a Latin cross (✝️). The “burthen” or weight bearing capacity of cargo of the \"Bevis\" was 150 tons. This does not mean the ship weighed only 150 tons because it more likely weighed three times (450 gross weight) or more of its cargo capacity. \n\nMany of the three masted merchant ships traveling across the Atlantic Ocean about this same time period were in the 450 to 650 ton range. \n\nThe cargo or “goods” were certified (not loaded) on 12 May 1638. Yet the ship had been “some Dayes gone to sea” by 2 May 1638. The shippers of the goods were Richard Dumer & Co. Henry Byles & Co. \n\nThe exact date of departure is often not known since departures often coincided with the daylight outgoing or “ebb” tide. This being anywhere from a few hours to more than a day after clearance was given to leave port. Some have cited 16 May 1638 and 12 May 1638) as the departure date, but without proof. Again, the had been “some Dayes gone to sea” by 2 May 1638.\n\n“They landed probably at Boston (the point of all but a handful of Bay Colony arrivals) in June or July 1638 (the average ocean crossing took five to eight weeks).”\n\nShe completed the voyage to the Americas because her passengers arrived and took up residence there. Her fate thereafter is unknown.\n\nThe 61 documented Bevis passengers enumerated or attested to on 2 May 1638 were mostly Puritans, leaving England for the New World driven by the quest for religious freedom at a time when England was moving toward ardent Catholicism. Scholar David B. Gracy, II, notes that some in the hierarchy of the King of England noticed the \"Bevis\" was almost entirely composed of Puritans and agents of the Kingdom sought to prevent the ship from setting sail in May 1638, but alas failed to prevent the sailing.\nA listing of passengers from the passenger image include; <br><br>\nFfrey John of Basing, Whelwrite , wife and 3 children <br>\nAustin Richard of Bishopstocke 40, Taylor , his wife and 2 children <br>\nKnight Robert 37, Carpenter Servant to R.

The following excerpt is from Eugene Cole Zubrinsky's online sketch of \"William2 Carpenter of Rehoboth\" which indicates an indirect connection between Dummer and the Carpenters:<br><br>\n\"The Bevis passenger list describes William2 and his father as “of Horwell,” that is, Whorwell (now Wherwell), in Horwell Hundred, Hampshire, about 15 miles south-south-east of Shalbourne. Wherwell, which had a tradition of religious dissent—at least two of its vicars, Stephen Bachiler (1587–1605) and his probable brother-in-law John Bate (1605–1633), were nonconformists—lies on a straight line from Shalbourne to the Bevis’s port of departure, at Southampton. (Another Bevis passenger in 1638 was Richard Dummer, who, with kinsman Bachiler, had been a partner in the Plough Company, which had recruited dissenters for migration to New England in 1631 and 1632.) It is clear from the chronology of Carpenter records at Shalbourne that the family was at Wherwell for a few months at most. It is indeed possible that they paused there only long enough to obtain from sympathetic authorities the certificates of conformity (one for each man) that customs officials would require for the Carpenters to leave England and from which the residence recorded for them on the passenger list was probably copied (TAG 70:193–94, 195n14; NEHGR 14:336; Old Hampshire Maps; see also “Focus on the Planter,” GMN 15, no. 4).\"\n\nSee the link: https://www.packrat-pro.com/ships/bevis.htm for the Bevis Passenger list on line.\n"}

His works include \"If He Hollers Let Him Go\" and the Harlem Detective series. In 1958 he won France's Grand Prix de Littérature Policière.\n\nChester Himes was born in Jefferson City, Missouri, on July 29, 1909, to Joseph Sandy Himes and Estelle Bomar Himes; his father was a peripatetic black college professor of industrial trades and his mother was a teacher at Scotia Seminary prior to marriage; Chester Himes grew up in a middle-class home in Missouri. When he was about 12 years old, his father took a teaching job in the Arkansas Delta at Branch Normal College (now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff), and soon a tragedy took place that would profoundly shape Himes's view of race relations. He had misbehaved and his mother made him sit out a gunpowder demonstration that he and his brother, Joseph Jr., were supposed to conduct during a school assembly. Working alone, Joseph mixed the chemicals; they exploded in his face. Rushed to the nearest hospital, the blinded boy was refused treatment because of Jim Crow laws. \"That one moment in my life hurt me as much as all the others put together,\" Himes wrote in \"The Quality of Hurt\".\n\nThe family later settled in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents' marriage was unhappy and eventually ended in divorce.\n\nHimes's family left Pine Bluff and relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, where he attended East High School. He attended Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, where he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, but was expelled for playing a prank. In late 1928 he was arrested and sentenced to jail and hard labor for 20 to 25 years for armed robbery and sent to Ohio Penitentiary. In prison, he wrote short stories and had them published in national magazines. He stated that writing in prison and being published was a way to earn respect from guards and fellow inmates, as well as to avoid violence.\n\nHis first stories appeared in 1931 in \"The Bronzeman\" and, starting in 1934, in \"Esquire\". His story \"To What Red Hell\" (published in \"Esquire\" in 1934) as well as to his novel \"Cast the First Stone\" – only much later republished unabridged as \"Yesterday Will Make You Cry\" (1998) – dealt with the catastrophic prison fire Himes witnessed at Ohio Penitentiary in 1930.\n\nIn 1934 Himes was transferred to London Prison Farm and in April 1936 was released on parole into his mother's custody. Following his release he worked at part-time jobs while continuing to write. During this period he came into contact with Langston Hughes, who facilitated Himes's contacts with the world of literature and publishing.\n\nIn 1936 Himes married Jean Johnson.\n\nIn the 1940s Himes spent time in Los Angeles, working as a screenwriter but also producing two novels, \"If He Hollers Let Him Go\" and \"The Lonely Crusade\", that charted the experiences of the wave of black in-migrants, drawn by the city's defense industries, and their dealings with the established black community, fellow workers, unions and management. He also provided an analysis of the Zoot Suit Riots for \"The Crisis\", the magazine of the NAACP.\n\nMike Davis in \"City of Quartz: Excavating the Future of Los Angeles\", describing the prevalence of racism in Hollywood in the 1940s and '50s, cites Himes' brief career as a screenwriter for Warner Brothers, terminated when Jack L. Warner heard about him and said: \"I don't want no niggers on this lot.\" Himes later wrote in his autobiography:\n\nBy the 1950s Himes had decided to settle permanently in France, a country he liked in part due to his popularity in literary circles. In Paris, Himes was the contemporary of the political cartoonist Oliver Harrington and fellow expatriate writers Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and William Gardner Smith.\n\nIt was in Paris in the late 1950s that Chester met his second wife Lesley Packard, when she went to interview him. She was a journalist at the \"Herald Tribune\", where she wrote her own fashion column, \"Monica\". He described her as \"Irish-English with blue-gray eyes and very good looking\"; he also saw her courage and resilience, Chester said to Lesley, \"You're the only true color-blind person I've ever met in my life.\" After he suffered a stroke, in 1959, Lesley quit her job and nursed him back to health. She cared for him for the rest of his life, and worked with him as his informal editor, proofreader, confidante and, as the director Van Peebles dubbed her, \"his watchdog\". After a long engagement, they were married in 1978.\n\nLesley and Chester faced adversities as a mixed-race couple but they prevailed. Theirs was a life lived with an unparallelled passion and great humor. Their circle of political colleagues and creative friends included not only such towering figures as Langston Hughes and Richard Wright; it also included figures such as Malcolm X, Carl Van Vechten, Picasso, Jean Miotte, Ollie Harrington, Nikki Giovanni and Ishmael Reed. Bohemian life in Paris would in turn lead them to the South of France and finally on to Spain, where they lived until Chester's death in 1984.\n\nIn 1969 Himes moved to Moraira, Spain, where he died in 1984 from Parkinson's disease. He is buried at Benissa cemetery.\n\nSome regard Chester Himes as the literary equal of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. Ishmael Reed says \"[Himes] taught me the difference between a black detective and Sherlock Holmes\" and it would be more than 30 years until another Black mystery writer, Walter Mosley and his Easy Rawlins and Mouse series, had even a similar effect.\n\nIn 1996, his widow Lesley Himes went to New York to work with Ed Margolies on the first biographical treatment of Himes's life, entitled \"The Several Lives of Chester Himes\", by long-time Himes scholars Edward Margolies and Michel Fabre, published in 1997 by University Press of Mississippi. Later, novelist and Himes scholar James Sallis published a more deeply detailed biography of Himes called \"Chester Himes: A Life\" (2000).\n\nA detailed examination of Himes's writing and writings about him can be found in \"Chester Himes: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography\" compiled by Michel Fabre, Robert E. Skinner, and Lester Sullivan (Greenwood Press, 1992).\n\nIn 2017, Lawrence P. Jackson published a significant, 600+ page biography of Himes titled \"Chester B. Himes: A Biography.\" \n\nHimes's novels encompassed many genres including the crime novel/mystery and political polemics, exploring racism in the United States.\n\nChester Himes wrote about African Americans in general, especially in two books that are concerned with labor relations and African-American workplace issues. \"If He Hollers Let Him Go\" – which contains many autobiographical elements – is about a black shipyard worker in Los Angeles during World War II struggling against racism, as well as his own violent reactions to racism. \"Lonely Crusade\" is a longer work that examines some of the same issues.\n\n\"Cast the First Stone\" (1952) is based on Himes's experiences in prison. It was Himes's first novel but was not published until about ten years after it was written. One reason may have been Himes' unusually candid treatment – for that time – of a homosexual relationship. Originally written in the third person, it was rewritten in the first person in a more \"hard-boiled\" style. \"Yesterday Will Make You Cry\" (1993), published after Himes's death, restored the original manuscript.\n\nHimes also wrote a series of Harlem Detective novels featuring Coffin Ed Johnson and Gravedigger Jones, New York City police detectives in Harlem. The novels feature a mordant emotional timbre and a fatalistic approach to street situations. Funeral homes are often part of the story, and funeral director H. Exodus Clay is a recurring character in these books.\n\nThe titles of the series include \"A Rage in Harlem\", \"The Real Cool Killers\", \"The Crazy Kill\", \"All Shot Up\", \"The Big Gold Dream\", \"The Heat's On\", \"Cotton Comes to Harlem\", and \"Blind Man with a Pistol\"; all written between 1957–1969.\n\n\"Cotton Comes to Harlem\" was made into a movie in 1970, which was set in that time period, rather than the earlier period of the original book. A sequel, \"Come Back, Charleston Blue\", was released in 1972, and \"For Love of Imabelle\" was made into a film under the title \"A Rage in Harlem\" in 1991.\n\nIn May 2011, Penguin Modern Classics in London republished five of Himes' detective novels from the Harlem Cycle.\n\n\n\nA useful companion to the two volumes of autobiography is \"Conversations with Chester Himes\", edited by Michel Fabre and Robert E. Skinner, published by University Press of Mississippi in 1995.\n\nFour of Chester Himes' novels were made into feature films: \"If He Hollers, Let Him Go!\" (1968) [uncredited], directed by Charles Martin; \"Cotton Comes to Harlem\", directed by Ossie Davis in 1970; \"Come Back, Charleston Blue\" (\"The Heat's On\") (1972), directed by Mark Warren and \"A Rage in Harlem\" (starring Gregory Hines and Danny Glover), directed by Bill Duke in 1991. Himes' short stories \"The Assassin of Saint Nicholas Avenue\" and \"Tang\" have also been filmed as short subjects.\n\n\n"}

H. O'D. Alexander as a pen name, was an Irish-born British cryptanalyst, chess player, and chess writer. He worked on the German Enigma machine at Bletchley Park during the Second World War, and was later the head of the cryptanalysis division at GCHQ for 25 years. In chess, he was twice British chess champion and earned the title of International Master.\n\nHugh Alexander was born into an Anglo-Irish family on 19 April 1909 in Cork, Ireland, the eldest child of Conel William Long Alexander, an engineering professor at University College, Cork (UCC), and Hilda Barbara Bennett. His father died in 1920 (during the Irish War of Independence), and the family moved to Birmingham in England where he attended King Edward's School. He won a scholarship to study mathematics at King's College, Cambridge, in 1928, graduating with a first in 1931. He represented Cambridge in chess.\n\nFrom 1932, he taught mathematics at Winchester, and married Enid Constance Crichton Neate (1900–1982) on 22 December 1934. Their elder son was Sir Michael O'Donel Bjarne Alexander (1936–2002), a diplomat. His other son was Patrick Macgillicuddy Alexander (20 March 1940 – 21 September 2005), a poet who settled in Australia in 1960. In 1938, Hugh Alexander left teaching and became head of research at the John Lewis Partnership.\n\nIn February 1940, Alexander arrived at Bletchley Park, the British codebreaking centre during the Second World War. He joined Hut 6, the section tasked with breaking German Army and Air Force Enigma messages. In 1941, he transferred to Hut 8, the corresponding hut working on Naval Enigma. He became deputy head of Hut 8 under Alan Turing. Alexander was more involved with the day-to-day operations of the hut than Turing, and, while Turing was visiting the United States, Alexander formally became the head of Hut 8 around November 1942. Other senior colleagues included Stuart Milner-Barry, Gordon Welchman, and Harry Golombek. In October 1944, Alexander was transferred to work on the Japanese JN-25 code.\n\nIn mid-1946, Alexander joined GCHQ (under the control of the Foreign Office), which was the post-war successor organisation to the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park. By 1949, he had been promoted to the head of \"Section H\" (cryptanalysis), a post he retained until his retirement in 1971. \n\nMI5's Peter Wright, in his 1987 best-selling book \"Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer\", wrote about Alexander's assistance to MI5 in the ongoing Venona project, as well as other important mutual cooperation between the two organizations, which broke down previous barriers to progress. \"Any help is gratefully received in this department\", Alexander told Wright, and that proved the case from then on. Wright also lauded Alexander's professionalism, and opined that the exceptional mental demands of his cryptanalytical career and chess hobby likely contributed to Alexander's early death at age 64, despite his healthy lifestyle.\n\nHe represented Cambridge University in the Varsity chess matches of 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932 (he studied at King's College, Cambridge). He was twice a winner of the British Chess Championship, in 1938 and 1956. He represented England in the Chess Olympiad six times, in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1939, 1954 and 1958. At the 1939 Olympiad in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Alexander had to leave part-way through the event, along with the rest of the English team, because of the declaration of World War II, since he was required at home for codebreaking duties. He was also the non-playing captain of England from 1964 to 1970. He was awarded the International Master title in 1950 and the International Master for Correspondence Chess title in 1970. He won Hastings 1946/47 with the score 7½/9, a point ahead of Savielly Tartakower. His best tournament result may have been first equal (with David Bronstein) at Hastings 1953/54, where he went undefeated and beat Soviet grandmasters David Bronstein and Alexander Tolush in individual games. Alexander's opportunities to appear abroad were limited as he was not allowed to play chess in the Soviet bloc because of his secret work in cryptography. He was also the chess columnist of \"The Sunday Times\" in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nMany knowledgeable chess people believe that Alexander had Grandmaster potential, had he been able to develop his chess abilities further. Many top players peak in their late twenties and early thirties, but for Alexander this stretch coincided with World War II, when high-level competitive opportunities were unavailable. After this, his professional responsibilities as a senior cryptanalyst limited his top-class appearances. He defeated Mikhail Botvinnik in one game of a team radio match against the Soviet Union in 1946, at a time when Botvinnik was probably the world's top player. Alexander made important theoretical contributions to the Dutch Defence and Petroff Defence.\n\nAlexander is portrayed by actor Matthew Goode in the 2014 film \"The Imitation Game\", which depicts the British attempts to crack the Enigma machine at Bletchley Park.\n\n\n\n"}

He began his ministry in the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), a fringe Christian denomination. An advocate of gay conversion, he founded, and is executive director of. Witness Freedom Ministries, which targets men and women seeking to change their sexual orientation and refrain from same-sex relationships. \n\nFoster was born into a family of Church of God in Christ preachers. His father was a pastor in the denomination, as was his grandfather, Ezekiel Foster, Sr whom he acknowledges as a major influence in his life. Foster was raised in Marlin, Texas, until his graduation where he enlisted in military service in 1982.\n\nAfter graduating from Marlin High School in 1980, Foster enrolled in McClennan Community College at Waco to study journalism and mass communications in hopes of landing a career as a media writer. While there, he served as the News Editor for the school's official paper, The Highland Herald. After a spending a decade in military service, Foster begin pursuing theology and enrolled in Liberty University's External Degree Program. He completed a course in \"Faith Writing\" offered by Baylor University and taught by writer William Mattox, Jr. Later, he studied theology at Atlanta Bible College, but withdrew after a year because of doctrinal concerns with the school's denominational affiliation.\n\nFoster served in various infantry and combat support units at Fort Campbell, KY, Fort Benning, GA, and 3rd Armored Division, Germany. He served in Operation Big Pine II in Honduras, 1983 and served as a US Chief of Staff driver during a year's tour with the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) in El Gorah Egypt from 1984-1985. In August 1991, his Fort Benning based unit deployed to Operation Desert Storm. Foster was the recipient of numerous service medals and honors including the Army Achievement Medal (2nd OLC), the Joint Service Commendation Medal and the rare Kuwait Liberation Medal presented by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Foster was honorably discharged in May 1992.\n\nIn his public testimonies, Foster has described himself as living as a gay man, until becoming a born-again Christian in 1990. The following year, he became a licensed minister in COGIC. He eventually \"came out\" as having lived as a homosexual male in the past, publicizing his testimony in the denomination, on a public-access cable channel in Waco, Texas. He gained national prominence when the Christian magazine \"Charisma\" featured him in the 1998 cover story entitled \"Let's Stop Hiding From the Pain\".\n\nHe founded Witness Freedom Ministries in Waco in 1996 and began developing programs to reach and assist Christian men and women with their personal struggles with sexuality. A conference was launched in 1998, and in 1999 Foster relocated the ministry to Atlanta, Georgia with a specific focus on people of color.\n\nIn 1998, he became associated with the ex-gay movement Exodus International.

Foster and other leaders of the movement defend their outreaches as part of the church's mission to provide help to people who \"struggle\" with homosexuality.\n\nHe founded the Restoration Sanctuary Church in Forest Park, Georgia, where he served as pastor from 2001–2008. The church was later renamed Praise Power Ministries.\n\nIn June 2007, Foster launched Gay Christian Movement Watch, a controversial blog which began calling attention to the \"gay christian movement\".\n\nIn September 2009, Foster launched Report COGIC Abuse, a second website which called attention to cases of clergy sexual abuse in his former denomination. Foster contended the church's leadership was turning a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children. The site stirred considerable resistance from leaders of the denomination, including Bishop Charles Blake, the church's Presiding Bishop. Blake told the \"Memphis Commercial Appeal\", \"\"Brother Foster has a flavor of the year he usually focuses on. His flavor this year is sexual harassment and sexual abuse.\"\n\nBlake said the attention the site has received is out of proportion, considering the thousands of COGIC leaders. \"Thirty allegations of sexual misbehavior is too many, but it should be looked at in that context,\" he said.\n\nFoster chronicled his 11 years of homosexual experiences in the semiautubiographical \"Touching A Dead Man: One Man's Explosive Story of Deliverance from Homosexuality\".\n\n"}

His productions include \"Chariots of Fire\", which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. He sits on the Labour benches in the House of Lords, although he is not principally a politician.\n\nPuttnam was born in Southgate, London, England, the son of Marie Beatrix, a homemaker of Jewish origin, and Leonard Arthur Puttnam, a photographer. Educated at Minchenden Grammar School in London, Puttnam had an early career in advertising, including five formative years at Collett Dickenson Pearce, and as agent acting for the photographers David Bailey and Brian Duffy.\n\nHe turned to film production in the late 1960s, working with Sanford Lieberson's production company Goodtimes Enterprises, where he produced films such as the rock musicals \"That'll Be the Day\" (1973) and \"Stardust\" (1974), Ken Russell's \"Mahler\" (1974) and \"Lisztomania\" (1975), and Alan Parker's \"Bugsy Malone\" (1976). In 1978, he also produced Alan Parker's \"Midnight Express\", but for the US company Casablanca Filmworks.\n\nIn 1976, he set up his own production company, Enigma Productions, through which he produced a string of films, such as \"The Duellists\" (Ridley Scott's feature film debut), \"Chariots of Fire\" (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture), \"Local Hero\", \"Memphis Belle\", \"Meeting Venus\" and \"The Killing Fields\" and \"The Mission\" with Roland Joffé (which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1986). Many of the Enigma films made in the 1980s were done in association with the financial backer Goldcrest Films.\n\nPuttnam was chairman and CEO of Columbia Pictures from June 1986 until September 1987.\n\nIn 1998, he retired from film production to focus on his work in education and the environment.\n\nIn 1983, Puttnam was appointed as a Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.

In 2002, he chaired the joint scrutiny committee on the Communications Bill, which recommended an amendment to prevent ownership of British terrestrial TV stations by companies with a significant share of the newspaper market. This was widely interpreted as being aimed at stopping Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation from buying channel Five. When the government opposed the amendment, Puttnam brokered a compromise – the introduction of a \"public interest\" test to be applied by the new regulator Ofcom, but without explicit restrictions.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Puttnam chaired the Hansard Society Commission on Communication of Parliamentary Democracy, the final report of which urged all political parties to commit to a renewal of parliamentary life in an attempt to reinvigorate representative democracy.

{"id": "102808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102808", "title": "Effie Gray", "text": "Effie Gray\n\nEuphemia Chalmers Millais, Lady Millais (\"née\" Gray; 7 May 1828 – 23 December 1897) was the wife of Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais. She had previously been married to the critic John Ruskin, but the marriage was annulled, and she left him without the marriage having been consummated. Her husband Millais was Ruskin's protégé. This famous Victorian \"love triangle\" has been dramatised in plays, films and an opera. \n\nShe was also an artist and an author for \"Effie in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin Written from Venice Between 1849 - 1852\" and \"Selling Light\", first published in 2008.\n\nEuphemia Chalmers Gray, initially known by the pet name of \"Phemy\", later as \"Effie,\" was born on 7 May 1828 to Sophia Margaret Gray and George Gray in Perth, Perthshire, Scotland. She had a sister named Sophy Gray.\n\nGray's family knew Ruskin's father, and they encouraged a match between Ruskin and Gray. Ruskin wrote the fantasy novel \"The King of the Golden River\" for her in 1841, when she was twelve years old. After their marriage in 1848, they travelled to Venice, where Ruskin was researching his book \"The Stones of Venice\". In England they lived in Bowerswell, the house where Ruskin's grandfather had killed himself by cutting his throat in 1817. \n\nTheir different personalities were thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the Ca' d'Oro and the Palazzo Ducale (Doge’s Palace), because he feared they would soon be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of the troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.\n\nWhen she met Millais five years later, she was still a virgin, as Ruskin had persistently put off consummating the marriage. His reasons are unclear, but they involved disgust with some aspect of her body. As she later wrote to her father,\n\n\"He alleged various reasons, hatred to children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and, finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening.\"\"\n\nRuskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings: \"It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.\" The reason for Ruskin's disgust with \"circumstances in her person\" is unknown. Various suggestions have been made, including revulsion at either her pubic hair, or menstrual blood. However, Robert Brownell, in his analysis \"Marriage of Inconvenience\", argues that Ruskin's difficulty with the marriage was financial and related to concerns that Effie and her less-affluent family were trying to tap into Ruskin's considerable wealth.\nWhile married to Ruskin, she modelled for Millais' painting \"The Order of Release\", in which she was depicted as the loyal wife of a Scottish rebel who has secured his release from prison. She then became close to Millais when he accompanied the couple on a trip to Scotland in order to paint Ruskin's portrait according to the critic's artistic principles. During this time, spent in Brig o' Turk in the Trossachs, they fell in love. While working on the portrait of her husband, Millais made many drawings and sketches of her. He also sent humorous cartoons of himself, Effie and Ruskin to friends. She copied some of his works.\n\nAfter their return to London, she left Ruskin, nominally to visit her family. She sent back her wedding ring with a note announcing her intention to file for an annulment. With the support of her family and a number of influential friends, she successfully pursued the case, causing a major public scandal, and their marriage was annulled on the grounds of 'incurable impotency' in 1854.\n\nIn 1855, she married John Millais and eventually bore him eight children: Everett, born in 1856; George, born in 1857; Effie, born in 1858; Mary, born in 1860; Alice, born in 1862; Geoffroy, born in 1863; John in 1865; and Sophie in 1868. Their youngest son, John Guille Millais, was a notable bird artist and gardener. She also modelled for a number of her husband's works, notably \"Peace Concluded\" (1856), which idealises her as an icon of beauty and fertility.\n\nWhen Ruskin later sought to become engaged to a teenage girl, Rose La Touche, Rose's parents were concerned. They wrote to Gray to ask about the marriage; she replied by describing Ruskin as an oppressive husband. The engagement was broken off.\n\nAfter his marriage, Millais began to paint in a broader style, which Ruskin condemned as a \"catastrophe\". Marriage had given him a large family to support, and it is claimed that his wife encouraged him to churn out popular works for financial gain and to maintain her busy social life. However, there is no evidence that she consciously pressured him to do so, though she was an effective manager of his career and often collaborated with him in choosing subjects. Her journal indicates her high regard for her husband's art, and his works are still recognisably Pre-Raphaelite in style several years after his marriage.\n\nHowever, Millais eventually abandoned the Pre-Raphaelite obsession with detail and began to paint in a looser style which produced more paintings for the time and effort. Many paintings were inspired by his family life with his wife, often using his children and grandchildren as models. Millais also used his sister-in-law, Sophy Gray, then in her early teens, as the basis of some striking images in the mid to late 1850s, provoking suggestions of a mutual infatuation.\n\nThe annulment from Ruskin barred her from events at which Queen Victoria was present. Both she and her husband were considerably bothered, as she had been socially very active, although many in society were still prepared to receive her and to press her case sympathetically. Eventually, when Millais was dying, the Queen relented through the intervention of her daughter Princess Louise, allowing Gray to attend an official function. Sixteen months after Millais' death, Effie died at Bowerswell on 23 December 1897 and was buried in Kinnoull churchyard, Perth, which is depicted in Millais's painting \"The Vale of Rest\".\n\nHer marriage to Ruskin and subsequent romance with Millais have been dramatised on many occasions:\n\n\n"}

Harrison was educated at Cheltenham College before entering Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. While at Woolwich he played competitive rugby union for the army and for Kent and was selected by the Barbarians. From Woolwich he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant in January 1914, after which he was invited to play football for Southend United F.C.. He took up hurdling and was soon selected to compete for England in the 120 metres hurdles against Scotland and Ireland.\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War Harrison was posted first to Harwich, manning anti-aircraft guns, and then to France, where he was involved in intense fighting around Hooge. He was promoted to Lieutenant in June 1915, and awarded the Military Cross later that year \"for gallantry and initiative at Givenchy, on 10 March 1915, when he rushed up his gun under heavy shell fire and close-range rifle fire, and destroyed a hostile machine gun\". He went on to fight at the Battle of Loos. He was promoted to temporary captain in November 1916, a promotion which was made permanent a year later. In 1918 he was promoted to brevet major, making him the youngest officer in the army to hold the rank at the time, and given command of an infantry school before appointment as a general staff officer first grade. By the end of the First World War, Harrison was attached to the 58th (London) Division and had been mentioned in dispatches four times.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, Harrison resumed his sports careers. He was selected for the \"Mother Country\" rugby team (forerunner to the British and Irish Lions) in 1919, and played for the army against Oxford University in 1920. Harrison's rugby career ended prematurely due to injury, after which he refocused on hurdling; he was selected for the 1920 Summer Olympics but was prohibited from competing due to heart problems. He was appointed master of the Royal Artillery Harriers and then selected for staff college. He went on to compete at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, and reached a semi-final in the 110 metres hurdles. After the Olympics, Harrison attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1925 to 1926 and was appointed adjutant to Lahore District, India, from 1928 to 1932. There he became master of the Lahore Hunt and took up big game shooting and racquets, in which he won the doubles event at the All India Championships. He returned to England in 1932, when he was promoted to permanent major. In 1934, Harrison was appointed a battery commander at Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire. Here he began painting, and eventually had three of his works hung at the Salon in Paris. Later that year, he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel and given command of the Oxford University Officer Training Corps (OTC) and lectured at the university on military history until he relinquished the post in 1938; he also became master of the South Oxfordshire Hunt.\n\nIn 1939, Harrison briefly served in Mandatory Palestine, commanding an infantry battalion at the end of the Arab Revolt under Major-General Bernard Montgomery, General Officer Commanding (GOC) 8th Infantry Division and a former Staff College instructor, who remarked that, \"having loosed 'Dreadnought Harrison' on the task of killing rebels [...] he needed no urging in this respect\". On 22 July 1939 Harrison was promoted to lieutenant colonel.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Harrison returned to England and was appointed Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA) with the 12th (Eastern) Infantry Division, based at Sevenoaks in Kent. Harrison was promoted to full colonel on 28 August 1939 (with seniority backdated to 1 January 1937), and, on the same date, to the temporary rank of brigadier. The 12th Division was sent overseas to France in April 1940 but left its artillery, and Harrison, behind. Severely mauled during the Battle of France the following month, the 12th Division was disbanded in July and Harrison became Brigadier, Royal Artillery (BRA) in Northern Ireland District before being posted to Tunisia, where he served as Commander, Corps of Royal Artillery (CCRA) in IX Corps, under, initially, Lieutenant-General John Crocker, and, from late April 1943, Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks. After the end of the campaign, Harrison was promoted to major general and served in General Dwight D. Eisenhower's Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) as Major General, Royal Artillery (MGRA); he was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Allied invasion of Sicily and continued in the post until 1943, when he returned to Britain to become General Officer Commanding (GOC) Sussex and Surrey District. Harrison was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) on 5 August 1943, and was promoted on 4 December 1943 to acting major-general. His rank of major-general was made temporary on 4 December 1944. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1945, and appointed aide-de-camp to King George VI in 1945, and retired from the army on 28 May 1946, having been granted the honorary permanent rank of major general.\n\nIn retirement, Harrison lived in Cornwall. He became master of the North Cornwall Hounds and was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Cornwall in 1955 and then High Sheriff of Cornwall in 1958. He also served as a justice of the peace, and chairman of St Lawrence's mental hospital in Bodmin. In spare time, he grew rhododendrons and bred Labrador Retrievers, and fished for trout. He also published three books, including an autobiography, \"Gunners, Game & Gardens\". His wife, Roza (née Stevenson), died in 1967. Harrison himself died in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on 20 December 1987 at the age of 94.\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery holds five photographic portraits of Harrison, three by Walter Stoneman from 1945 and two by Bassano Ltd from 1947.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10957", "title": "Francis Xavier", "text": "Francis Xavier\n\nFrancis Xavier, S.J. (; born Francisco de Jasso y Azpilicueta; Latin \"Franciscus Xaverius\"; Basque: \"Frantzisko Xabierkoa\"; Spanish: \"Francisco Javier\"; 7 April 15063 December 1552), was a Navarrese Basque Roman Catholic missionary, who was a co-founder of the Society of Jesus.\n\nBorn in Javier (Xavier in Navarro-Aragonese or Xabier in Basque), Kingdom of Navarre (in present day Spain), he was a companion of Saint Ignatius of Loyola and one of the first seven Jesuits who took vows of poverty and chastity at Montmartre, Paris, in 1534. He led an extensive mission into Asia, mainly in the Portuguese Empire of the time and was influential in evangelization work, most notably in India. The Goa Inquisition was proposed by St. Francis Xavier. He also was the first Christian missionary to venture into Japan, Borneo, the Maluku Islands, and other areas. In those areas, struggling to learn the local languages and in the face of opposition, he had less success than he had enjoyed in India. Xavier was about to extend his missionary preaching to China when he died on Shangchuan Island.\n\nHe was beatified by Pope Paul V on 25 October 1619 and canonized by Pope Gregory XV on 12 March 1622. In 1624 he was made co-patron of Navarre. Known as the \"Apostle of the Indies\" and \"Apostle of Japan\", he is considered to be one of the greatest missionaries since Saint Paul. In 1927, Pope Pius XI published the decree \"Apostolicorum in Missionibus\" naming Saint Francis Xavier, along with Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, co-patron of all foreign missions. He is now co-patron saint of Navarre with San Fermin. The Day of Navarre (Día de Navarra) in Spain marks the anniversary of Saint Francis Xavier's death, on 3 December 1552.\n\nFrancis Xavier was born in the royal castle of Xavier, in the Kingdom of Navarre, on 7 April 1506 according to a family register. He was the youngest son of Juan de Jasso y Atondo, seneschal of Xavier castle, who belonged to a prosperous farming family and had acquired a doctorate in law at the University of Bologna. Juan later became privy counsellor and finance minister to King John III of Navarre (Jean d'Albret). Francis's mother was Doña María de Azpilcueta y Aznárez, sole heiress of two noble Navarrese families. He was through her related to the great theologian and philosopher Martín de Azpilcueta.\n\nIn 1512, Ferdinand, King of Aragon and regent of Castile, invaded Navarre, initiating a war that lasted over 18 years. Three years later, Francis's father died when Francis was only nine years old. In 1516, Francis's brothers participated in a failed Navarrese-French attempt to expel the Spanish invaders from the kingdom. The Spanish Governor, Cardinal Cisneros, confiscated the family lands, demolished the outer wall, the gates, and two towers of the family castle, and filled in the moat. In addition, the height of the keep was reduced by half. Only the family residence inside the castle was left. In 1522 one of Francis's brothers participated with 200 Navarrese nobles in dogged but failed resistance against the Castilian Count of Miranda in Amaiur, Baztan, the last Navarrese territorial position south of the Pyrenees.\n\nIn 1525, Francis went to study in Paris at the Collège Sainte-Barbe, University of Paris, where he would spend the next eleven years. In the early days he acquired some reputation as an athlete and a high-jumper.\n\nIn 1529, Francis shared lodgings with his friend Pierre Favre. A new student, Ignatius of Loyola, came to room with them. At 38, Ignatius was much older than Pierre and Francis, who were both 23 at the time. Ignatius convinced Pierre to become a priest, but was unable to convince Francis, who had aspirations of worldly advancement. At first Francis regarded the new lodger as a joke and was sarcastic about his efforts to convert students. When Pierre left their lodgings to visit his family and Ignatius was alone with Francis, he was able to slowly break down Francis's resistance. According to most biographies Ignatius is said to have posed the question: \"What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" However, according to James Broderick such method is not characteristic of Ignatius and there is no evidence that he employed it at all.\n\nIn 1530 Francis received the degree of Master of Arts, and afterwards taught Aristotelian philosophy at Beauvais College, University of Paris.\n\nOn 15 August 1534, seven students met in a crypt beneath the Church of Saint Denis (now Saint Pierre de Montmartre), on the hill of Montmartre, overlooking Paris. They were Francis, Ignatius of Loyola, Alfonso Salmeron, Diego Laínez, Nicolás Bobadilla from Spain, Peter Faber from Savoy, and Simão Rodrigues from Portugal. They made private vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to the Pope, and also vowed to go to the Holy Land to convert infidels. Francis began his study of theology in 1534 and was ordained on 24 June 1537.\n\nIn 1539, after long discussions, Ignatius drew up a formula for a new religious order, the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). Ignatius's plan for the order was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540.\n\nIn 1540 King John of Portugal had Pedro Mascarenhas, Portuguese ambassador to the Holy See, request Jesuit missionaries to spread the faith in his new possessions in India, where the king believed that Christian values were eroding among the Portuguese. After successive appeals to the Pope asking for missionaries for the East Indies under the Padroado agreement, John III was encouraged by Diogo de Gouveia, rector of the Collège Sainte-Barbe, to recruit the newly graduated students that would establish the Society of Jesus.\n\nIgnatius promptly appointed Nicholas Bobadilla and Simão Rodrigues. At the last moment, however, Bobadilla became seriously ill. With some hesitance and uneasiness, Ignatius asked Francis to go in Bobadilla's place. Thus, Francis Xavier began his life as the first Jesuit missionary almost accidentally.\n\nLeaving Rome on 15 March 1540, in the Ambassador's train, Francis took with him a breviary, a catechism, and by Croatian humanist Marko Marulić, a Latin book that had become popular in the Counter-Reformation. According to a 1549 letter of F. Balthasar Gago from Goa, it was the only book that Francis read or studied. Francis reached Lisbon in June 1540 and, four days after his arrival, he and Rodrigues were summoned to a private audience with the King and the Queen.\n\nFrancis Xavier devoted much of his life to missions in Asia, mainly in four centres: Malacca, Amboina and Ternate, Japan, and China. His growing information about new places indicated to him that he had to go to what he understood were centres of influence for the whole region. China loomed large from his days in India. Japan was particularly attractive because of its culture. For him, these areas were interconnected; they could not be evangelised separately.\n\nFrancis Xavier left Lisbon on 7 April 1541, his thirty-fifth birthday, along with two other Jesuits and the new viceroy Martim Afonso de Sousa, on board the \"Santiago\". As he departed, Francis was given a brief from the pope appointing him apostolic nuncio to the East. From August until March 1542 he remained in Portuguese Mozambique, and arrived in Goa, then capital of Portuguese India, on 6 May 1542, thirteen months after leaving Lisbon.\n\nThe Portuguese, following quickly on the great voyages of discovery, had established themselves at Goa thirty years earlier. Francis's primary mission, as ordered by King John III, was to restore Christianity among the Portuguese settlers. According to Teotonio R. DeSouza, recent critical accounts indicate that apart from the posted civil servants, \"the great majority of those who were dispatched as 'discoverers' were the riff-raff of Portuguese society, picked up from Portuguese jails.\" Nor did the soldiers, sailors, or merchants come to do missionary work, and Imperial policy permitted the outflow of disaffected nobility. Many of the arrivals formed liaisons with local women and adopted Indian culture. Missionaries often wrote against the \"scandalous and undisciplined\" behaviour of their fellow Christians.\n\nThe Christian population had churches, clergy, and a bishop, but there were few preachers and no priests beyond the walls of Goa. The Velliapura family of Velim, Goa, of the St Thomas Christians sect, welcomed the missionaries. Xavier decided that he must begin by instructing the Portuguese themselves, and gave much of his time to the teaching of children. The first five months he spent in preaching and ministering to the sick in the hospitals. After that, he walked through the streets ringing a bell to summon the children and servants to catechism. He was invited to head Saint Paul's College, a pioneer seminary for the education of secular priests, which became the first Jesuit headquarters in Asia.\nXavier soon learned that along the Pearl Fishery Coast, which extends from Cape Comorin on the southern tip of India to the island of Mannar, off Ceylon (Sri Lanka), there was a Jāti of people called Paravas. Many of them had been baptised ten years before, merely to please the Portuguese who had helped them against the Moors, but remained uninstructed in the faith. Accompanied by several native clerics from the seminary at Goa, he set sail for Cape Comorin in October 1542. He taught those who had already been baptised, and preached to those who weren't. His efforts with the high-caste Brahmins remained unavailing.\n\nHe devoted almost three years to the work of preaching to the people of southern India and Ceylon, converting many. He built nearly 40 churches along the coast, including St. Stephen's Church, Kombuthurai, mentioned in his letters dated 1544.\n\nDuring this time, he was able to visit the tomb of Thomas the Apostle in Mylapore (now part of Madras/Chennai then in Portuguese India). He set his sights eastward in 1545 and planned a missionary journey to Makassar on the island of Celebes (today's Indonesia).\n\nAs the first Jesuit in India, Francis had difficulty achieving much success in his missionary trips. His successors, such as de Nobili, Matteo Ricci, and Beschi, attempted to convert the noblemen first as a means to influence more people, while Francis had initially interacted most with the lower classes; (later though, in Japan, Francis changed tack by paying tribute to the Emperor and seeking an audience with him).\nIn the spring of 1545 Xavier started for Portuguese Malacca. He laboured there for the last months of that year. About January 1546, Xavier left Malacca for the Maluku Islands, where the Portuguese had some settlements. For a year and a half he preached the Gospel there. He went first to Ambon Island, where he stayed until mid-June. He then visited other Maluku Islands, including Ternate, Baranura, and Morotai. Shortly after Easter 1547, he returned to Ambon Island; a few months later he returned to Malacca.\n\nIn Malacca in December 1547, Francis Xavier met a Japanese man named Anjirō. Anjirō had heard of Francis in 1545 and had travelled from Kagoshima to Malacca to meet him. Having been charged with murder, Anjirō had fled Japan. He told Francis extensively about his former life, and the customs and culture of his homeland. Anjirō became the first Japanese Christian and adopted the name of 'Paulo de Santa Fe'. He later helped Xavier as a mediator and interpreter for the mission to Japan that now seemed much more possible.\n\nIn January 1548 Francis returned to Goa to attend to his responsibilities as superior of the mission there. The next 15 months were occupied with various journeys and administrative measures. He left Goa on 15 April 1549, stopped at Malacca, and visited Canton. He was accompanied by Anjiro, two other Japanese men, Father Cosme de Torrès, and Brother João Fernandes. He had taken with him presents for the \"King of Japan\" since he was intending to introduce himself as the Apostolic Nuncio.\n\nEuropeans had already come to Japan: the Portuguese had landed in 1543 on the island of Tanegashima, where they introduced matchlock firearms to Japan.\n\nFrom Amboina, he wrote to his companions in Europe: \"I asked a Portuguese merchant, … who had been for many days in Anjirō’s country of Japan, to give me … some information on that land and its people from what he had seen and heard. ...All the Portuguese merchants coming from Japan tell me that if I go there I shall do great service for God our Lord, more than with the pagans of India, for they are a very reasonable people. (To His Companions Residing in Rome, From Cochin, 20 January 1548, no. 18, p. 178).\n\nFrancis Xavier reached Japan on 27 July 1549, with Anjiro and three other Jesuits, but he was not permitted to enter any port his ship arrived at until 15 August, when he went ashore at Kagoshima, the principal port of Satsuma Province on the island of Kyūshū. As a representative of the Portuguese king, he was received in a friendly manner. Shimazu Takahisa (1514–1571), \"daimyō\" of Satsuma, gave a friendly reception to Francis on 29 September 1549, but in the following year he forbade the conversion of his subjects to Christianity under penalty of death; Christians in Kagoshima could not be given any catechism in the following years. The Portuguese missionary Pedro de Alcáçova would later write in 1554:\n\nHe was hosted by Anjirō's family until October 1550. From October to December 1550, he resided in Yamaguchi. Shortly before Christmas, he left for Kyoto but failed to meet with the Emperor. He returned to Yamaguchi in March 1551, where the daimyo of the province gave him permission to preach. However, lacking fluency in the Japanese language, he had to limit himself to reading aloud the translation of a catechism.\n\nFrancis was the first Jesuit to go to Japan as a missionary. He brought with him paintings of the Madonna and the Madonna and Child. These paintings were used to help teach the Japanese about Christianity. There was a huge language barrier as Japanese was unlike other languages the missionaries had previously encountered. For a long time Francis struggled to learn the language.\n\nHaving learned that evangelical poverty did not have the appeal in Japan that it had in Europe and in India, he decided to change his approach. Hearing after a time that a Portuguese ship had arrived at a port in the province of Bungo in Kyushu and that the prince there would like to see him, Xavier now set out southward. The Jesuit, in a fine cassock, surplice, and stole, was attended by thirty gentlemen and as many servants, all in their best clothes. Five of them bore on cushions valuable articles, including a portrait of Our Lady and a pair of velvet slippers, these not gifts for the prince, but solemn offerings to Xavier, to impress the onlookers with his eminence. Handsomely dressed, with his companions acting as attendants, he presented himself before Oshindono, the ruler of Nagate, and as a representative of the great kingdom of Portugal, offered him letters and presents: a musical instrument, a watch, and other attractive objects which had been given him by the authorities in India for the emperor.\n\nFor forty-five years the Jesuits were the only missionaries in Asia, but the Franciscans also began proselytising in Asia as well. Christian missionaries were later forced into exile, along with their assistants. Some were able to stay behind, however Christianity was then kept underground so as to not be persecuted.\n\nThe Japanese people were not easily converted; many of the people were already Buddhist or Shinto. Francis tried to combat the disposition of some of the Japanese that a God who had created everything, including evil, could not be good. The concept of Hell was also a struggle; the Japanese were bothered by the idea of their ancestors living in Hell. Despite Francis's different religion, he felt that they were good people, much like Europeans, and could be converted.\n\nXavier was welcomed by the Shingon monks since he used the word \"Dainichi\" for the Christian God; attempting to adapt the concept to local traditions. As Xavier learned more about the religious nuances of the word, he changed to \"Deusu\" from the Latin and Portuguese \"Deus\". The monks later realised that Xavier was preaching a rival religion and grew more aggressive towards his attempts at conversion.\nWith the passage of time, his sojourn in Japan could be considered somewhat fruitful as attested by congregations established in Hirado, Yamaguchi, and Bungo. Xavier worked for more than two years in Japan and saw his successor-Jesuits established. He then decided to return to India. Historians debate the exact path he returned by, but from evidence attributed to the captain of his ship, he may have travelled through Tanegeshima and Minato, and avoided Kagoshima because of the hostility of the daimyo. During his trip, a tempest forced him to stop on an island near Guangzhou, China, where he met Diogo Pereira, a rich merchant and an old friend from Cochin. Pereira showed him a letter from Portuguese prisoners in Guangzhou, asking for a Portuguese ambassador to speak to the Chinese Emperor on their behalf. Later during the voyage, he stopped at Malacca on 27 December 1551, and was back in Goa by January 1552.\n\nOn 17 April he set sail with Diogo Pereira on the \"Santa Cruz\" for China. He planned to introduce himself as Apostolic Nuncio and Pereira as ambassador of the King of Portugal. But then he realized that he had forgotten his testimonial letters as an Apostolic Nuncio. Back in Malacca, he was confronted by the \"capitão\" Álvaro de Ataíde da Gama who now had total control over the harbour. The \"capitão\" refused to recognize his title of Nuncio, asked Pereira to resign from his title of ambassador, named a new crew for the ship, and demanded the gifts for the Chinese Emperor be left in Malacca.\n\nIn late August 1552, the \"Santa Cruz\" reached the Chinese island of Shangchuan, 14 km away from the southern coast of mainland China, near Taishan, Guangdong, 200 km south-west of what later became Hong Kong. At this time, he was accompanied only by a Jesuit student, Álvaro Ferreira, a Chinese man called António, and a Malabar servant called Christopher. Around mid-November he sent a letter saying that a man had agreed to take him to the mainland in exchange for a large sum of money. Having sent back Álvaro Ferreira, he remained alone with António. He died from a fever at Shangchuan, Taishan, China, on 3 December 1552, while he was waiting for a boat that would take him to mainland China.\n\nXavier was first buried on a beach at Shangchuan Island, Taishan, Guangdong. His incorrupt body was taken from the island in February 1553 and was temporarily buried in St. Paul's church in Portuguese Malacca on 22 March 1553. An open grave in the church now marks the place of Xavier's burial. Pereira came back from Goa, removed the corpse shortly after 15 April 1553, and moved it to his house. On 11 December 1553, Xavier's body was shipped to Goa. The body is now in the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Goa, where it was placed in a glass container encased in a silver casket on 2 December 1637. This casket, constructed by Goan silversmiths between 1636 and 1637, was an exemplary blend of Italian and Indian aesthetic sensibilities. There are 32 silver plates on all the four sides of the casket depicting different episodes from the life of the Saint:\n\n\nThe right forearm, which Xavier used to bless and baptise his converts, was detached by Superior General Claudio Acquaviva in 1614. It has been displayed since in a silver reliquary at the main Jesuit church in Rome, Il Gesù.\n\nAnother of Xavier's arm bones was brought to Macau where it was kept in a silver reliquary. The relic was destined for Japan but religious persecution there persuaded the church to keep it in Macau's Cathedral of St. Paul. It was subsequently moved to St. Joseph's and in 1978 to the Chapel of St. Francis Xavier on Coloane Island. More recently the relic was moved to St. Joseph's Church.\n\nIn 2006, on the 500th anniversary of his birth, the Xavier Tomb Monument and Chapel on the Shangchuan Island, in ruins after years of neglect under communist rule in China, was restored with support from the alumni of Wah Yan College, a Jesuit high school in Hong Kong.\n\nFrom December 2017 to February 2018, Saint Francis Xavier's first class relic of his arm toured in various locations in Canada. The faithful, especially students participating with Catholic Christian Outreach at Rise Up 2017 in Ottawa, venerated the relics. The tour continued to every city where CCO and/or the Jesuits are present in Canada: Quebec City, St. John's, Halifax, St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish (neither CCO nor the Jesuits are present here), Kingston, Toronto, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Regina, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria, and Montreal before returning to Ottawa. The relic was then returned to Rome with a Mass of Thanksgiving celebrated by Archbishop Terrence Prendergast at the Church of the Gesu.\n\nFrancis Xavier was beatified by Paul V on 25 October 1619, and was canonized by Gregory XV on 12 March (12 April) 1622, at the same time as Ignatius Loyola. Pius XI proclaimed him the \"Patron of Catholic Missions\". His feast day is 3 December.\n\nSaint Francis Xavier's relics are kept in a silver casket, elevated inside the Bom Jesus Basilica and are exposed (being brought to ground level) generally every ten years, but this is discretionary. The sacred relics went on display starting on 22 November 2014 at the XVII Solemn Exposition. The display closed on 4 January 2015. The previous exposition, the sixteenth, was held from 21 November 2004 to 2 January 2005.\n\nRelics of Saint Francis Xavier are also found in the Espirito Santo (Holy Spirit) Church, Margão, in Sanv Fransiku Xavierachi Igorz (Church of St. Francis Xavier), Batpal, Canacona, Goa. and at St. Francis Xavier Chapel, Portais, Panjim.\n\nOther pilgrimage centres include Saint Francis Xavier's birthplace in Navarra, Church of Il Gesu, Rome, Malacca (where he was buried for 2 years, before being brought to Goa), Sancian (Place of death), and more.\n\nSaint Francis Xavier is a major venerated saint in both Sonora and the neighbouring U.S. state of Arizona. In Magdalena de Kino in Sonora, Mexico, in the Church of Santa María Magdalena, there is reclining statue of San Francisco Xavier brought by pioneer Jesuit missionary Padre Eusebio Kino in the early 18th century. The statue is said to be miraculous and is the object of pilgrimage for many of the region. Also Mission San Xavier del Bac is a pilgrimage site. The mission is an active parish church ministering to the people of the San Xavier District, Tohono O'odham Nation, and nearby Tucson, Arizona.\n\nThe Novena of Grace is a popular devotion to Francis Xavier, typically prayed either on the nine days before 3 December, or on 4 March through 12 March (the anniversary of Pope Gregory XV's canonisation of Xavier in 1622). It began with the Italian Jesuit missionary Marcello Mastrilli. Before he could travel to the Far East, Mastrilli was gravely injured in a freak accident after a festive celebration dedicated to the Immaculate Conception in Naples. Delirious and on the verge of death, Mastrilli saw Xavier, who he later said asked him to choose between travelling or death by holding the respective symbols, to which Mastrilli answered, \"I choose that which God wills.\" Upon regaining his health, Mastrilli made his way via Goa and the Philippines to Satsuma, Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate beheaded the missionary in October 1637, after undergoing three days of tortures involving the volcanic sulphurous fumes from Mt. Unzen, known as the \"Hell mouth\" or \"pit\" that had supposedly caused an earlier missionary to renounce his faith.\n\nSaint Francis Xavier is noteworthy for his missionary work, both as organiser and as pioneer, reputed to have converted more people than anyone else has done since Saint Paul. Pope Benedict XVI said of both Ignatius of Loyola and Francis Xavier: \"not only their history which was interwoven for many years from Paris and Rome, but a unique desire — a unique passion, it could be said — moved and sustained them through different human events: the passion to give to God-Trinity a glory always greater and to work for the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ to the peoples who had been ignored.\" By consulting with the earlier ancient Christians of St. Thomas in India, Xavier developed Jesuit missionary methods. His success also spurred many Europeans to join the order, as well as become missionaries throughout the world. His personal efforts most affected Christians in India and the East Indies (Indonesia, Malaysia, Timor). India still has numerous Jesuit missions, and many more schools. Xavier also worked to propagate Christianity in China and Japan. However, following the persecutions of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the subsequent closing of Japan to foreigners, the Christians of Japan were forced to go underground to develop an independent Christian culture. Likewise, while Xavier inspired many missionaries to China, Chinese Christians also were forced underground and developed their own Christian culture.\n\nA small chapel designed by Achille-Antoine Hermitte was completed in 1869 over Xavier's death place on Shangchuan Island, Canton.\nIt was damaged and restored several times, with the most recent restoration in 2006 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of his birth. \nFrancis Xavier is the patron saint of his native Navarre, which celebrates his feast day on 3 December as a government holiday. In addition to Roman Catholic Masses remembering Xavier on that day (now known as the Day of Navarra), celebrations in the surrounding weeks honour the region's cultural heritage. Furthermore, in the 1940s, devoted Catholics instituted the Javierada, an annual day-long pilgrimage (often on foot) from the capital at Pamplona to Xavier, where the Jesuits have built a basilica and museum and restored his family's castle.\n\nAs the foremost saint from Navarre and one of the main Jesuit saints, he is much venerated in Spain and the Hispanic countries where \"Francisco Javier\" or \"Javier\" are common male given names. The alternative spelling \"Xavier\" is also popular in the Basque Country, Portugal, Catalonia, Brazil, France, Belgium, and southern Italy. In India, the spelling \"Xavier\" is almost always used, and the name is quite common among Christians, especially in Goa and the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. The names \"Francisco Xavier\", \"António Xavier\", \"João Xavier\", \"Caetano Xavier\", \"Domingos Xavier\" et cetera, were very common till quite recently in Goa. \"Fransiskus Xaverius\" is commonly used as a name for Indonesian Catholics, usually abbreviated as FX. In Austria and Bavaria the name is spelled as \"Xaver\" (pronounced (ˈk͡saːfɐ)) and often used in addition to Francis as \"Franz-Xaver\" (frant͡sˈk͡saːfɐ). Many Catalan men are named for him, often using the two-name combination Francesc Xavier. In English speaking countries, \"Xavier\" until recently was likely to follow \"Francis\"; in the 2000s, however, \"Xavier\" by itself has become more popular than \"Francis\", and since 2001 is now one of the hundred most common male baby names in the U.S.A. Furthermore, the Sevier family name, possibly most famous in the United States for John Sevier, originated from the name Xavier.\n\nMany churches all over the world, often founded by Jesuits, have been named in honour of Xavier. The many in the United States include the historic St. Francis Xavier Shrine at Warwick, Maryland, (founded 1720, the school of the American founding father Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832) – longest living signer and only Catholic at the Continental Congress to sign the Declaration of Independence, 1776), and cousin to the first American-born Bishop John Carroll, Bishop and later Archbishop of Baltimore, 1790–1815, There are also the American educational teaching order Xaverian Brothers, the Basilica of St. Francis Xavier in Dyersville, Iowa, and the Mission San Xavier del Bac in Tucson, Arizona (founded in 1692, and known for its Spanish Colonial architecture).\n\nRubens painted \"St Francis Xavier Raising the Dead\" for a Jesuit church in Antwerp, in which he depicted one of St Francis's many miracles. The Charles Bridge in Prague, Czech Republic, features a statue of Francis Xavier.\nIn front of Oita Station of Oita City, in Oita Prefecture, previously known as Bungo Province in Japan, there is one statue of Francis Xavier.\nThe monument Padrão dos Descobrimentos in Belém (Lisbon), Portugal, features Francis Xavier image.\n\nShortly before leaving Xavier had issued a famous instruction to Father Gaspar Barazeuz who was leaving to go to Ormuz (a kingdom on an island in the Persian Gulf, formerly attached to the Empire of Persia, now part of Iran), that he should mix with sinners:\n\nModern scholars place the number of people converted to Christianity by Francis Xavier at around 30,000. And while some of Xavier's methods have been since criticised (he forced converts to take Portuguese names and dress in Western clothes, approved the persecution of the Eastern Church, and used the Goa government as a missionary tool), he has also earned praise. He insisted that missionaries adapt to many of the customs, and most certainly the language, of the culture they wish to evangelise. And unlike later missionaries, Xavier supported an educated native clergy. Though for a time it seemed his work in Japan was subsequently destroyed by persecution, Protestant missionaries three centuries later discovered that approximately 100,000 Christians still practised in the Nagasaki area.\n\nFrancis Xavier's work initiated permanent change in eastern Indonesia, and he was known as the \"Apostle of the Indies\" where in 1546–1547 he worked in the Maluku Islands among the people of Ambon, Ternate, and Morotai (or Moro), and laid the foundations for a permanent mission. After he left the Maluku Islands, others carried on his work and by the 1560s there were 10,000 Roman Catholics in the area, mostly on Ambon. By the 1590s there were 50,000 to 60,000.\n\nDeeply imbued with the theology of the later Augustine, he was fiercely \"jealous\" of \"God's greater glory\" and deeply suspicious of the \"untutored\" efforts of man to scale the heights of the spirit. This world view led him to missionary tactics that even the Jesuit James Patrick Broderick, though writing an admiring biography, condemns as Xavier's \"woefully inadequate views about Indian religion and civilization\". It was, however, most common for Catholic missionaries to have dim hope for the salvation of those who were not baptized, up to the time of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s \n\nThe role of Francis Xavier in the Goa Inquisition is controversial. He had written to King João III of Portugal in 1546, encouraging him to dispatch the Inquisition to Goa, which he did many years later in 1560. Francis Xavier died in 1552 without living to see the horrors of the Goa Inquisition, but some historians believe that he was aware of the Portuguese Inquisition's brutality. In an interview to an Indian newspaper, historian Teotónio de Souza stated that Francis Xavier and Simão Rodrigues, another founder-member of the Society of Jesus, were together in Lisbon before Francis left for India. Both were asked to assist spiritually the prisoners of the Inquisition and were present at the very first auto-da-fé celebrated in Portugal in September 1540, at which 23 were absolved and two were condemned to be burnt, including a French cleric. Hence, he believes that Xavier was aware of the brutality of the Inquisition.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "739586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=739586", "title": "George W. Crawford", "text": "George W. Crawford\n\nGeorge Walker Crawford (December 22, 1798 – July 27, 1872) was a licensed attorney turned politician from Columbia County, Georgia. Crawford was appointed attorney general for the state in 1827, by Governor John Forsyth, serving in that capacity until 1831. Crawford also served five years in the General Assembly's lower house as a representative of Richmond County on a platform of states' rights.\n\nGeorge Crawford served in the U.S. House of Representatives, filling the seat vacated by Richard W. Habersham who died while in office. Crawford was elected Georgia's 38th governor – serving two terms from 1843–47. He became the only Whig Party candidate in state history to occupy the Governor's Mansion. Crawford also served as United States Secretary of War from 1849–50.\n\nCrawford's time in President Zachary Taylor's cabinet was marred by speculation regarding a probate claim he settled for George Galphin's heirs. Crawford received a gratuity of \"substantial remuneration\" for his services' - Crawford's political adversaries framed it as the \"Galphin Affair\" – marking the end of Crawford's political aspirations. When President Taylor unexpectedly died while in office, Crawford resigned his position as Secretary of War and entered political retirement.\n\nIn 1861, however, Crawford was elected a delegate from Richmond County to the state's Secession Convention which brought him out of retirement to answer the call of his constituents. By the convention's first order of business, Crawford was elected \"Permanent President of the Convention\" by which he presided over Georgia's decision to secede from the Union.\n\nGeorge Walker Crawford was born on December 22, 1798, in Columbia County, Georgia. He was the fourth son of Peter and Mary Ann Crawford. His father was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War from Virginia who had settled in Georgia to claim a land share, known as a \"bounty grant\", which the state of Georgia had set aside for \"those who had fought for independence\".\n\n\"Peter Crawford\" acquired a sizable tract of land that he called \"Belair Plantation\". The homestead was situated close to his uncle, Joel Crawford. Peter's uncle Joel fathered William H. Crawford, soon becoming a politician renowned locally for his political service to the state and for two presidential bids – running in 1816, and then again in 1824.\n\nGeorge Crawford grew up on the family's estate, heavily influenced by his father, and his cousin William as well. George's father was a practicing attorney and George availed himself to the well-stocked personal library of his father while homeschooling his education. Peter Crawford also entered Georgia politics himself – beginning as Columbia County's first \"clerk of courts\" and becoming a 10-term representative in the state legislature. George Crawford's cousin, William H. Crawford, was also becoming well known for his political service, and was the subject of local legend for two famous duels he had been a principal of.\n\nGeorge Crawford built on his homeschooling at the College of New Jersey's school of law (\"later becoming Princeton University\"). Crawford graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1820, and subsequently completed an internship under the tutelage of Richard Henry Wilde. Crawford was licensed to practice law in 1822, and started a legal practice in Augusta partnering with Henry H. Cumming. He went on to obtain a master's degree from the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, the founding college of the University of Georgia. After graduating Franklin, Crawford served from 1824 to 1825, as a second lieutenant in the 10th Regiment of the Georgia Militia.\n\nIn 1826, George Crawford married Mary Ann MacIntosh, having four children of the marriage: William Peter, Sarah MacIntosh, Anna Elizabeth, and Charles. George W. Crawford embarked on his political career the following year, accepting a gubernatorial appointment to become Georgia's attorney general.\n\nGovernor John Forsyth appointed Crawford to succeed Thomas F. Wells as Georgia's attorney general in 1827. The following year, Crawford challenged Congressman Thomas E. Burnside, Ambrose Burnside's uncle, to a duel over published defamation Burnside had written about Crawford's father.\n\nHe shot Burnside dead in the infamous duel, prompting the state to pass new legislation; \"forbidding persons involved in duels from holding office\". The restriction only applied to duels fought after the law was enacted and did not affect Crawford's career. He continued serving as attorney general until 1831, when he was succeeded by Charles J. Jenkins.\n\nWhen George Crawford read the anonymous letter to the editor published in \"The Augusta Chronicle\" he was incensed by the prose – sharply criticizing the political views of his father, then declining in health. Crawford regarded it as an attack on his father's good name. Crawford demanded the newspaper editor give him the author's name but the editor refused, protecting Burnside's identity by telling Crawford the letter was from a woman, and that for this reason, he would not release the person's name.\n\nInexplicably, Burnside contacted Crawford telling him that he was the author. Crawford immediately challenged Burnside to a duel which Burnside accepted, although with reluctance. The code duello was waning in vogue but it was still held as a measure which an honorable man was obliged to endure. Burnside was aspiring his own political career which showed promise of upward mobility. Burnside felt he would be shamed with dishonor if he refused, and in his era, without honor there was no career in politics.\n\nDueling had already been outlawed in Georgia so the two belligerents, with their seconds, traveled together by train to Fort Mitchell, Alabama where the practice was still legal – to finish what by then had become a \"well-publicized fight\". Burnside seemed to have sensed the duel would not end in his favor, dispatching a letter to his wife on the eve of the fateful encounter:Fort Mitchell, Jan. 24, 1828Dear Wife and Mother:    Tomorrow I fight. I do it on principle. Whatever may be my fate, I believe I am right. On this ground I have acted and will act. I believe I shall succeed, but if I do not I am prepared for consequences. Kiss the children and tell them that if I fall my last thought was of them. Yours most affectionatelyThomas E. BurnsideThomas E. Burnside was interred in the private burial ground of Colonel John Crowell, renowned for his participation in the War of 1812. The Colonel lived near the site where the duel had taken place and personally ensured every protocol of respect was accorded at Burnside's burial. Two weeks passed before Mrs. Burnside received word of her husband's demise. It was said that she nearly died herself from distraught upon receiving the news.\n\nShe moved with her children to Dahlonega, Georgia, residing there until her death. Crawford carried regret for his role in what was called \"a deplorable and unfortunate affair\". He was known to have made anonymous financial contributions to Burnside's widow and children though he was remembered as saying it made no amends – and for having expressed lament shortly before his own death in 1872.\n\nIn 1837, Crawford was elected to the Georgia General Assembly as a member of the House of Representatives for Richmond County. There, Crawford distinguished himself as a fiscal conservative. He was elevated to the United States House of Representatives as a Whig to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Richard W. Habersham. His term there was short, only serving from January 7 to March 3, 1843.\n\nGeorge W. Crawford was the Whig Party's nominee for governor in 1843. Crawford defeated the Democratic nominee, Mark Anthony Cooper, by a vote of 38,813 to 35,325 succeeding Charles J. McDonald to become the first Whig candidate to serve as Georgia's governor (\"as of 2014, he remains the only Whig governor\"). The Whigs won a majority in both houses of the state legislature in 1843, as well. Crawford was reelected in 1845, defeating Democratic challenger Matthew H. McAllister by a margin of 1,751 votes.\n\nWith the legislature's support, Crawford was able to effect the Whig's agenda which focused on debt reduction and fiscal restraint. Crawford's administration was able to reduce expenditures more than $66,000 in its first year and nearly eliminate the state's debt of $500,000 before being succeeded by George W. Towns. Besides implementing sound budget policy, Crawford was able to expand educational opportunities in the state and hasten construction of the state-owned Western and Atlantic Railroad.\n\nCrawford's administration established the Supreme Court of Georgia as well, which had failed to be institutionalized for decades of previous effort. He redrew the state's congressional maps, and reformed the state penitentiary – making it \"a more economically sound institution\". Crawford also succeeded at dismantling the Georgia Central Bank, an important Whig campaign endeavor for years.\n\nWhen General Zachary Taylor became President of the United States in 1849, he appointed Crawford United States Secretary of War. As War Secretary, he was involved in settling a claim from the United States government for the Galphin family, descendants of George Galphin, an American businessman who specialized in Indian Trade. Crawford received a large payment for his services and several of his political foes seized upon the opportunity to suggest impropriety.\n\nCrawford was subsequently investigated by a commission and completely exonerated of any wrongdoing yet his critics continued casting aspersions. Crawford resigned along with the rest of the Taylor administration in 1850, when Millard Fillmore became president after Taylor's sudden death while in office.\n\nIn 1861, Crawford was elected as a delegate from Richmond County, Georgia to the state's Secession Convention. The delegation elected Crawford president of the convention by a unanimous vote and he oversaw the state's vote of secession. As the convention's president, Crawford is considered the author of Georgia's Ordinance of Secession, the official document announcing the state's formal intent to secede the federal Union – originally as an independent republic, ultimately to join the Confederate States of America.\n\nThe delegation approved the ordinance January 19, 1861, with 208 voting in favor of secession and 89 opposed. The delegates signed the document in celebratory fashion two days later in the public square in front of the statehouse in Milledgeville where the convention was assembled. Crawford survived to witness the consequences of enacting the ordinance, lamenting its cost in the shed blood of Georgia citizens rallied by the convention's call.\n\nCrawford was to be tried for inciting a rebellion due to his role in presiding over the state's secession and was excluded from eligibility for both Lincoln's and Johnson's amnesty proclamations because of his leadership status. Crawford escaped the harsh consequences of an adjudication of guilt in 1865, when Johnson approved his direct application for amnesty thereby restoring Crawford as a citizen of the United States in good stead – with full protection of his person and property against all forms of reprisal.\n\nCrawford died on July 27, 1872, at his \"Belair\" estate, located near Augusta, Georgia. His funeral was held in St. Paul's Episcopal Church and he was buried in Summerville Cemetery located in Augusta.\n\nOn November 16, 1943, the keel was laid for the \"SS George Walker Crawford\", a liberty ship built by the J.A. Jones Construction Company in Brunswick, Georgia honoring Crawford for his service to the state of Georgia. The ship was launched January 1, 1944, and delivered into federal service January 13, 1944.\n\nCrawford's biographer Len Cleveland said that in researching his material he observed that \"Crawford's entire political career was motivated by a traditional sense of duty rather than by deep political convictions\". Robert Toombs spoke well of Crawford, Saying, \"There are but few abler and no purer men in America, and he has administrative qualities of an unusually high order.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10224122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10224122", "title": "Gerald and Sheila Broflovski", "text": "Gerald and Sheila Broflovski\n\nGerald and Sheila Broflovski (sometimes spelled Broslovski, Broslofski, Brovlofski or Broflofski) are fictional characters in the animated television series \"South Park\". The two are an upper middle-class married Jewish couple who raise their ten-year-old son Kyle and three-year-old Canadian-born adopted son Ike in the fictional town of South Park, Colorado.\n\nIn tradition with the show's animation style, they are both composed of simple geometrical shapes, and are animated with use of a computer, though they are given the impression of being construction paper cutout compositions animated through the use of stop motion, which was the technique used to animate the \"Spirit of Christmas\" shorts and the show's first episode. Gerald is voiced by series co-creator Matt Stone and Sheila was originally voiced by Mary Kay Bergman and is currently voiced by Mona Marshall. Their first names are derived from the first names of Stone's parents, Gerald and Sheila Stone.\n\nThough they are named for Stone's parents, Gerald and Sheila's characters are not largely inspired by the couple. While Stone's mother is Jewish, his father is a gentile of Irish descent, and Stone says they raised him in an agnostic household. Stone decided to portray the character of Gerald as recognizably Jewish, stating that doing so \"creates more opportunity for comedy\". Gerald grew up in South Park, and met Sheila while they attended college. The two moved back to Gerald's hometown when Kyle was younger because Sheila wanted to raise her children in a small town environment, but in Smug Alert!, the Broflovskis briefly moved to San Francisco when Gerald felt that South Park wasn't \"progressive\" enough. In a few instances, Sheila indicated displeasure with Gerald's indulgent and hypocritical behaviour, and Gerald occasionally displays subdued annoyance with his wife's meddling in others' lives. However, their marriage has been portrayed as more stable than those of the other prominent adult couples in the series, and the couple once overcame a temporary setback in their sex life when Gerald briefly suffered from erectile dysfunction.\n\nGerald and Sheila share a strong devotion to their Jewish religion, while expressing deep concern during the multiple times Kyle's faith in Judaism becomes enervated; However, in earlier episodes the couple has been portrayed attending the Catholic church in South Park. The couple tend to showcase liberal viewpoints, having protested the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supported Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential race.\n\nGerald is a lawyer who also serves on South Park's council as the city attorney, and his role in this profession has been put on display in episodes such as \"Sexual Harassment Panda\" and \"Chef Goes Nanners\" in which a trial or legal issue plays a large part in the plot. He commonly wears an olive-green jacket over a purple shirt and forest green trousers. He sports a contemporary beard and separated mustache, and is almost always seen donning a pink yarmulke. When not wearing the yarmulke, Gerald is shown to have male-pattern baldness. He is a generally kind, amiable person, though at intervals he has been shown to assume a snobbish attitude that disaffects his friends and family such as the episode Chicken Pox where it is revealed that he used to be close with Kenny McCormick's father but that the two had a falling out due to economic differences or when he begins acting like an arrogant snob after buying a hybrid car in Smug Alert!. In \"Sexual Harassment Panda\", Gerald repeatedly sued South Park Elementary (which was faultless in every case), and later every citizen of South Park, showing his shameless monetary greed and disregard for civil propriety. Gerald was once seen to have a repressed gambling problem, and prior struggles with a fictional form of inhalant abuse known within the show as \"cheesing\". Gerald is, in season 20 of the show, revealed to be an internet troll. His internet alias is 'Skankhunt42', and initially, everyone thinks that Eric Cartman is, in fact, Skankhunt42. When trolling, he makes provocative statements against women, and, most notably, \"puts a dick in [women's] mouths\". He always drinks red wine and listens to music by Boston when trolling. His antics eventually place him in the news after trolling a Danish olympian.\n\nSheila made her first appearance in the season one episode \"Death\" (where she was originally named Carol), and she exhibits several traits commonly associated with those of a stereotypical Jewish mother. She wears her hair in a beehive, is overweight, and typically wears a midnight blue suit jacket over a light gray blouse, with a dark red skirt and gray stockings. She speaks with a New York/New Jersey accent, and appears to be of less-than-average height relative to the other female adults on the show. In the episode \"It's a Jersey Thing\", it is revealed that Sheila was originally from New Jersey, where she was known as \"S-Wow Tittybang\", and that she and Gerald moved to South Park to avoid having their newly conceived child grow up there. Apart from being briefly appointed to the fictional federal position of \"Secretary of Offense\" under the Clinton Administration, Sheila is a stay-at-home mother. As a result of hearing something shocking or inappropriate, she is often heard exclaiming \"WHAT, WHAT, \"WHAT\"!?\", saying each word in rapid succession and putting more emphasis on the last \"what\". Sheila has been depicted as being a huge fan of Barbra Streisand.\n\nIn earlier seasons, Sheila often spearheaded public opposition to things she deemed harmful to children or to the Jewish community. She led a group to New York City to protest Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian comedy duo whose television show's toilet humor is what she believed to be a negative influence on Kyle. Her outrage escalated in \"\" when she further protested Terrance and Phillip by forming \"Mothers Against Canada\", which eventually instigated a war between Canada and the United States. At the climax of the film, she takes her crusade against the duo to the extreme by shooting Terrance and Phillip, which fulfills an apocalyptic prophecy allowing Satan, his minions, and his lover Saddam Hussein to invade the Earth. This aspect has been toned down in recent years, and is more or less completely absent from newer episodes. Her relationship with Gerald varies, in the episode \"Spontaneous Combustion\" it is shown that Gerald suffers from periodic sexual dysfunction which put a strain on their relationship. In \"Insecurity\", she and her husband used a sexual role play to have better sex.\n\nUpon seeing Kyle taking part in a school play which involved a nativity scene, Sheila pleads with the mayor to ban the use of any religious imagery within the town that could perceived as offensive to those of different beliefs. In addition to her ethnicity, Eric Cartman also despises Sheila's activism, which he perceives as an attempt to inhibit anyone's ability to have fun. Cartman has even expressed his hatred for Sheila by singing a song entitled \"Kyle's Mom's a Bitch\".\n\nAlthough Sheila is inclined to be overprotective of her children, she and Gerald tend to be caring and loving of both Kyle and Ike, with Sheila often referring to the boys with Yiddish terms of endearment. The couple often try to strengthen the bond between their two sons, and encourage Kyle to accept and love Ike as though they were biological brothers. The two also accompany Ike during activities that enrich his status as a child prodigy, such as sitting with him as he read two John Steinbeck novels in one day. Gerald is mostly seen as a responsible and caring father, and often attempts to teach Kyle important morals, though sometimes to a fault. Thinking he would delight Kyle by making more money, Gerald instead distressed his son by increasing the family's income at the expense of bankrupting the local elementary school. Gerald also alienated Kyle (and several other townsfolk) when, as one of the very few hybrid vehicle owners in South Park, he became increasingly self-righteous. Despite these isolated incidents, Kyle usually holds a high opinion of Gerald. Sheila is often unaware of the overwhelming effect her protests has on Kyle until Kyle gains enough courage to confront her and tell her that her actions are not the proper way to be a mother figure in his life. Kyle tends to show that he truly loves Sheila, and takes offense to any insult Cartman may offer about her.\n\nSheila has a deceased mother named Cleo (who also shares Gerald's surname of Broflovski) who is frequently mentioned on the show. She was seen (albeit as a corpse) in the episode \"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery\" when Kyle reluctantly allowed his friends to exhume her body so that they could use it in a Halloween prank. Sheila also has a nephew named Kyle (her sister's son) who is another of the show's embodiment of Jewish stereotypes.

An Enlightenment-educated polymath and polyglot, he was one of the most influential people of his generation. Asachi was a respected journalist and political figure, as well as active in technical fields such as civil engineering and pedagogy, and, for long, the civil servant charged with overseeing all Moldavian schools. Among his leading achievements were the issuing of \"Albina Românească\", a highly influential magazine, and the creation of \"Academia Mihăileană\", which replaced Greek-language education with teaching in Romanian. His literary works combined a taste for Classicism with Romantic tenets, while his version of the literary language relied on archaisms and borrowings from the Moldavian dialect.\n\nA controversial political figure, Asachi endorsed the Imperial Russian presence in Moldavia and played a major part in establishing the \"Regulamentul Organic\" regime, while supporting the rule of Prince Mihail Sturdza. He thus came to clash with representatives of the liberal current, and opposed both the Moldavian revolution of 1848 and the country's union with Wallachia. Engaged in a long polemic with the liberal leader Mihail Kogălniceanu, he was, together with Nicolae Vogoride, involved in the unsuccessful attempt to block the unionist project through the means of an electoral fraud. Asachi was noted for his deep connections with the Western culture, which led him to support the employment of foreign experts in various fields and educational institutions. He cultivated a relationship with the French historian Edgar Quinet, whose father-in-law he became in 1852.\n\nAsachi was born in Hertsa, a small town which is now part of Ukraine. His family originated in Austrian-ruled Transylvania, where it was known under the name \"Asachievici\". His father, Lazăr, was an Orthodox priest who kept close contacts with Metropolitan Veniamin Costachi; according to several sources, he was of Armenian (Aromanian) descent. His mother Elena (née Niculau or Ardeleanu) was herself the daughter of a Transylvanian priest. The couple had another son, named Petru. Lazăr Asachi was his son's first educator, after which the young Gheorghe most likely enrolled in the Church-run primary school in Herţa.\n\nIn summer 1795, after deciding not to send Gheorghe and Petru to Moldavian Greek-language school in the capital city of Iaşi, Lazăr Asachi opted to give them a more modern education in Austrian lands, sending them to Lemberg, where they attended gymnasium. After completing seven terms of education in Latin, Polish and German, Gheorghe Asachi entered university (the present-day Lviv University) at the age of 14. He studied at the Faculty of Letters, Philosophy and Sciences (attending lectures in logic, metaphysics, ethics, mathematics, physics, natural history, and architecture), but, in 1804, after two years of studies, he withdrew and returned to Moldavia. Despite this, his level of familiarity with Western culture was arguably unparalleled in his native country during the first half of the 19th century. Over the following decades, he designed several lodgings in both his native country and Galicia.\n\nHis return followed the death of his mother and Lazăr Asachi's appointment as First Protopope of the Moldavian Metropolitan Seat, and saw the family settling in Iaşi.\n\nIn early 1805, Asachi fell ill with malaria, and was helped by Metropolitan Veniamin to leave for Vienna, where doctors had advised him to seek treatment. As the recipient of a stately scholarship, Asachi studied mathematics and astronomy with Tobie Bürg, as well as pursuing training in the art of painting.\n\nHis time in the city coincided with French Empire's successes in the Napoleonic Wars, and, most important, with the 1805 War of the Third Coalition, during which \"La Grande Armée\" occupied Vienna; this allowed Asachi to familiarize himself with French Revolutionary and liberal tenets, which he partly adopted in his political activities. In 1808, as the Russo-Turkish War erupted, Moldavia was occupied by the Russian Empire, First Protopope Lazăr contacted Pavel Chichagov to have his son appointed lieutenant and local head of the Corps of Engineers, but Gheorghe Asachi refused to assume office or even return from Vienna. Instead, he left for the Italian Peninsula in April 1808, aiming to complete his studies in Rome, but making long stops in other localities on the way (he notably visited Trieste, Venice, Padova, Ferrara, Bologna and Florence). Reaching the capital of the Papal States on June 11, Asachi left on August 19 to visit Naples, Pompeii, and other locations in the Kingdom of Sicily. Upon reaching Mount Vesuvius, he descended unaccompanied into the volcanic crater, and was encouraged by a cheering audience.\n\nHe soon after returned to Rome, where he focused on studying Renaissance Latin and Italian literature, as well as taking classes in archeology, painting and sculpture, and entering his most prolific phase in visual arts. In 1809, while visiting an art shop near the Spanish Steps, he met Bianca Milesi, the 19-year-old daughter of a wealthy merchant from Milan, with whom he fell in love. Despite her 1825 marriage to a French doctor, he was to remain her passionate admirer until her death from cholera in 1849. He later stressed that she had been a major source of inspiration for him, especially in allowing him the transition \"from painter to poet\", while the literary critic Eugen Lovinescu believed she inspired Asachi's Romantic nationalism.\n\nAt the time, he authored his first poems on Romanian nationalist subjects, which earned him an award presented by the Roman Literary Society. One of these was \"Viitorul\" (\"The Future\"), which voiced a call for national regeneration. Interested in the origin of the Romanians and the history of Roman Dacia, Asachi studied events depicted on Trajan's Column and searched the Vatican Library for documents regarding the history of Romania. It was during the latter research that he came across Dimitrie Cantemir's \"History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire\" in its English-language edition.\n\nThrough Bianca Milesi, Asachi met François Miollis, the French commander in Rome, who reportedly told him that Napoleon Bonaparte intended to emancipate Moldavia and Wallachia as a result of the expedition into Russia, and thus create a new \"Dacian Kingdom\" in the area of present-day Romania. Partly as a result of this encouragement, Asachi decided to travel back home on June 22, 1812, and, sailing down to Galaţi, arrived in Iaşi on August 30. His designs regarding French protection over the Danubian Principalities were ended by Napoleon's retreat from Russia, and by the restoration of Ottoman suzerainty and Phanariote rules, when Sultan Mahmud II appointed Scarlat Callimachi as Prince.\n\nIn reaction to these developments, Gheorghe Asachi centered his attention on cultural improvements, Westernization, and Enlightenment teachings, with support from Metropolitan Veniamin. In 1813, his expertise and familiarity with European languages led Prince Callimachi to appoint him Reviewer (\"Referandar\") for the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn 1814, increasingly opposed to the Greek-language teaching favored by the Phanariotes, Asachi proposed the first in a series of Romanian-language educational institutions, a course in engineering and topography to be held at the Princely Academy in Iaşi; once approved by the ruler and countersigned by Veniamin, the lectures attracted a number of young boyars (including the future Ottoman diplomat Alexandros Kallimachis, Scarlat's son, Teodor Balş (who was to serve as Moldavia's \"kaymakam\" in 1856-1857), Daniel Scavinschi, as well as Gheorghe Asachi's brother Petru. He gave various lectures, and offered additional training in drawing and art history, as well as in Romanian history. He organized several exhibits of his students' work in technical drawing. Despite a favorable report from its inspectors, Asachi's facility soon met with opposition from Greek teachers at the Academy, which led it to be closed soon after its original students graduated (1819).\n\nNevertheless, Asachi was not stripped of his professorship, and was allowed to maintain both his position as head of the Princely Library and his house on Academy grounds. Later in the same year, he was involved in reorganizing the Orthodox seminary at Iaşi's Socola Monastery, and traveled to Transylvania in order to enlist the help of scholars active there. His friendly relations with various leaders of the Transylvanian School helped in achieving this goal; in 1820, he returned to Moldavia accompanied by Vasile Fabian Bob, Ioan Costa, Ion Manfi and Vasile Pop, all of whom became teachers at the Academy.\n\nEarly in 1821, Gheorghe Asachi's activities were interrupted when the Greek Filiki Eteria forces crossed the Prut River and took over Moldavia on their way to Wallachia, during what constituted the earliest stage of the Greek War of Independence. Like his father (who died in 1825), Metropolitan Veniamin, and many other notable Moldavians, Asachi fled into Russian territory. He returned the following year, as the Ottoman Empire retook the region and put an end to Phanariote rules (a measure which attracted Asachi's enthusiasm); the new prince, Ioan Sturdza, appointed him Moldavian representative to the Austrian Empire, an office which he held between November 30, 1822 and February 1827. With this, he was awarded the traditional rank of \"Great Comis\", and thus joined the ranks of nobility. As a diplomat, Asachi was foremost noted for his contacts with nationalist intellectuals who represented various ethnicities subject to the Austrian Empire.\n\nWhile in Vienna, he met the Austrian woman Elena Tauber, former governess of the Sturdza children and widow of the merchant Kiriako Melirato; she was his concubine until 1827, when they were married in an Orthodox church in Iaşi. Tauber had three children from her marriage to Melirato — a girl, Hermiona, and two boys, Alexandru and Dimitrie (later, a mathematician); all of them were adopted by Asachi.\n\nSoon after returning, Asachi was appointed caretaker of all Moldavian schools and \"Vel Agha\". In March 1828, he succeeded in opening a multilingual upper school and gymnasium, connected to the Trei Ierarhi Church, named \"Şcoala Vasiliană\" or \"Gimnaziul Vasilian\" (in honor of the 17th-century prince Vasile Lupu, who had created the original education institution on that site). It was the first modern institution of its kind in Moldavia, and was soon supplemented by a college. \"Şcoala Vasiliană\" also continued the engineering course, taught by Gheorghe Filipescu, and had additional chairs in mathematics, architecture, applied mechanics and hydraulics; in 1834, it sent several of its alumni, including the architect Alexandru Costinescu, for further studies abroad. On July 19, 1827, a great fire in Iaşi's western quarter destroyed Asachi's lodging, as well as the vast majority of his possessions and manuscripts.\n\nUpon the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, Moldavia and Wallachia again came under Russian administration. During that interval, Asachi decided to expand his educational goals and popularize new ideas through the means of press institutions, and requested approval from the Russian consul in Iaşi, Matvey Minciaky, to have these set up. In April 1829, Russia endorsed his project for a magazine titled \"Albina Românească\", which first saw print in July of the same year. The first periodical to be published in Moldavia, it ran its own printing press, known as \"Institutul Albinei\" and originally housed in the Trei Ierarhi area. Alongside its stated goal (which involved generating a literary language), \"Albina Românească\" hosted pieces on current events, scientific essays, as well as articles offering practical advice.\n\nOver the following decades, it oversaw the publishing of several other magazines, which were originally designed as supplements; among these, \"Alăuta Românească\" (1837–1838) and \"Foaea Sătească a Prinţipatului Moldovei\" (1839) were initiated by the younger activist Mihail Kogălniceanu, who, through his influential publication \"Dacia Literară\", become a vocal critic of Asachi's political and cultural views. First and foremost, Kogălniceanu expressed his dissatisfaction over the fact that \"Albina Românească\" relied on publishing translations from foreign authors, instead of encouraging national specificity.\n\nIn addition, Asachi also issued a large panel of related works, including a series of almanacs which ran between 1847 and 1870. Another magazine created by Asachi, the short-lived \"Spicuitorul Moldo-Român\" (1841–1842), was published in both Romanian and French, having a Frenchman named Gallice, who worked as a teacher, for its co-editor.\n\nIn late 1829, through a framework first outlined in the Akkerman Convention, Russian governor Peter Zheltukhin established a boards of experts from both countries, charged with drafting the constitutional project eventually known as \"Regulamentul Organic\". The project was delayed by the ongoing war and epidemics of cholera and bubonic plague until 1831-1832, as Pavel Kiselyov took over for Zheltukhin; Gheorghe Asachi served as secretary of the Moldavian board — the body also comprised Mihail Sturdza, Iordache Catagiu, Constantin Cantacuzino-Paşcanu and Costache Conachi.\n\nThe membership outlined for the Moldavian board scandalized the lesser boyars, who pointed out that the Akkerman treaties called for the new legislation to be adopted through a vote in a representative Boyar Divan, and who attempted to have Asachi and Conachi recalled. Despite the protests, the board continued its activities, being overseen by the former consul Minciaky; together with Mihail Sturdza and the Wallachian Alexandru Vilara, Asachi was dispatched to Saint Petersburg to obtain the approval of Emperor Nicholas I, which led to the document being enforced in both Principalities. In its final version, the \"Regulament\" endorsed his efforts as educator, regulating public education and transferring assets donated by Vasile Lupu to \"Şcoala Vasiliană\".\n\nThe trade regulations offered by the \"Regulament\" were welcomed with enthusiasm by Asachi, prompting him to write an ode in their honor, titled \"Annul nou al moldo-românilor 1830, în care s-a lucrat Regulamentul organic, acel întâi cod administrativ al Moldovei\" (\"The New Year of the Moldo-Romanians 1830, in Which \"Regulamentul Organic\", the First Administrative Code of Moldavia, Was Completed\"). In sharp contrast to his later advocacies, Asachi attempted to introduce provisions for the two Principalities' union, and some of his interventions in the text were meant to facilitate this project. At the time, he took a compassionate view in respect to peasants, denouncing the exploitation of their labor by the boyars.\n\nGheorghe Asachi was heavily impressed by the institutions he saw functioning in the Russian capital, and did his best to replicate them in Moldavia. After his return from Russia, Asachi became head of the Moldavian National Archives, in which capacity he published the first collection of documents referring to the country's history. From early 1834 onwards, he was a main collaborator of the newly appointed prince and former colleague on the Moldavian board, Mihail Sturdza, receiving funds and benefiting from on order to prioritize education in \"Moldavian\" (Romanian).\n\nIn July of the same year, Asachi visited the Wallachian capital of Bucharest, being charged by Minciaky with strengthening the common framework of the \"Regulament\" by ensuring that its two versions did not differ in content. By May 1833, he was able to move into a new house, which he designed and erected in the \"Muntenimea\" area of Copou Hill, on a large plot of land he had purchased from Lupu Balş; at around the same time, \"Institutul Albinei\" was also reopened on the new location. An 1852 survey showed that Asachi had a second, smaller, house in downtown Iaşi.\n\nIn late 1834, on Asachi's request, Sturdza gave approval for the first Moldavian girls' school to be opened in the capital. On June 6, 1835, following Asachi's interventions, \"Academia Mihăileană\", the first Romanian-language institution of higher education, was established in the city. A fundamental institution of higher learning, and the nucleus for the present-day University of Iaşi, it also hosted lectures by cultural figures from Moldavia, Transylvania and Wallachia alike, including some of Asachi's young rivals; among the teachers were Mihail Kogălniceanu, Ion Ionescu de la Brad, Eftimie Murgu, Ion Ghica, and August Treboniu Laurian. In addition, Asachi presented a plan to create a school of agronomy, to function alongside the city's military academy, and, by 1848, created a school for further qualification in engineering.\n\nOn November 15, 1836, he founded, alongside \"Vornic\" Ştefan Catargiu and \"Spătar\" Alecsandri (the father of poet Vasile Alecsandri), a conservatory, and, after 1837, was appointed head of the Moldavian Theater, among the first of its kind to showcase original pieces in Romanian. At the head of a committee, he took charge of translating a German-language dictionary into Romanian, stressing that this was a response to the Moldavians' need for knowledge. During the early 1840s, he became interested in organizing education for the non-emancipated Armenian and Jewish communities — in 1842, it was as a result of his efforts that an Armenian primary school was set up.\n\nIn 1847, Asachi's printing press issued an Armenian-language primer. He was also the person behind the creation of the Iaşi School of Arts and Crafts (January 1841), as well as helping establish the first public library, the paper mill near Piatra Neamţ, an Art Gallery and a National History Museum. In the meantime, \"Academia Mihăileană\" was disestablished and transformed into a French-language school (overseen by a teacher named Malgouverné).\n\nOver the same decade, Asachi moved towards Conservatism, defending \"Regulamentul Organic\" in front of the increasingly popular liberal current. He clashed with young activists who rejected Sturdza's rule, and, as early as 1839, noted with dissatisfaction that \"a new people was born [...], with new wishes and ideas\". His conflict with Kogălniceanu was transported to the field of politics, and Asachi joined in condemning the anti-\"Regulament\" failed rebellion of 1848. As most other press venues submitted to the minimal requirement of Russian officials and avoided publishing any material related to the revolution, \"Albina Românească\" criticized the revolutionaries for having discarded \"their duty to the powers that be\", and praised Russia for sending its troops to combat \"anarchy\". Despite this, Kogălniceanu later claimed that, on one occasion, he had seen Asachi sobbing over having been made to criticize the Romanian activists.\n\nThe debate prolonged itself over the following years, and, coupled with Asachi's unwaivering support for Sturdza, saw him joining the separatist camp at a time the post-revolutionary group \"Partida Naţională\" began openly campaigning for Moldo-Wallachian unification. While supporting the interests of the middle class, Asachi stressed that these could compliment a feudal system, and rejected the revolutionary call for abolishing privilege.\n\nAlso in 1848, Asachi lost his daughter, the 19-year-old Eufrosina, to the cholera outbreak. He published two poems written in her memory.\n\nIn January 1850, almost one year after the Convention of Balta Liman awarded the Moldavian throne to the reform-minded and revolutionary sympathizer Grigore Alexandru Ghica, \"Albina Românească\" changed its name to \"Gazeta de Moldavia\", adopting an official tone. Asachi, who resigned his positions as inspector and archivist in 1849, was awarded a substantial pension. Between 1851 and 1854, he was head of censorship, using this position to award \"imprimatur\" for reformist ideas (with Prince Ghica's tacit approval). At the time, he gave endorsement to the \"Chronicle of Huru\", a document which was claimed to trace a direct lineage between Roman Dacia and Moldavia, and to clarify the more mysterious aspects of the country's early medieval history — the document was used by separatists to emphasize Moldavia's tradition of independence, but was the subject to an inquiry and dismissed by Kogălniceanu (it was later established that the text was a forgery).\n\nDuring the political battles which followed Ghica's retirement and the Crimean War, \"Gazeta de Moldavia\" transformed itself into an official platform for the anti-unionist camp. After the retreat of Russian troops and an interval of Austrian administration, Moldavia and Wallachia's government came under the direct supervision of various European powers, and \"Kaymakam\" Teodor Balş ensured the interregnum in Iaşi. In this context, Ottoman authorities, through the voice of Fuat Pasha, gave their approval for relative freedom of the press to be legislated. With Costache Negruzzi, Asachi again became an official censor, while again assuming the offices of archivist and inspector of Moldavian schools.\n\nAs the Treaty of Paris imposed the creation of ad hoc Divans, through which the two countries' inhabitants were allowed to decide their future, the unionist camp saw a chance for fulfilling its goals; Asachi and his associates reacted vehemently, and, in May 1857, complained to the Porte that unification would bring about various perils. One month later, the government of \"Kaymakam\" Nicolae Vogoride carried out an electoral fraud to yield a separatist majority in the ad hoc Divan — Asachi, who supported Sturdza's bid for the throne, is thought to have played a major part in bringing this about, and, together with Vogoride himself, Nicolae Istrati, and the Austrian consul Oskar von Gödel-Lannoy, to have drawn up falsified the electoral lists. He was himself a candidate in the Iaşi electoral college, receiving 197 votes and placing himself second among the representatives it sent to the Divan. His magazine stood alone in claiming that the regime had acted impartially.\n\nThe suffrage was hotly contested and annulled through an agreement between the Second French Empire and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; Asachi himself was thus forced to note that the new elections in August managed to overturn the previous results. He was no longer elected a deputy, and his candidature for the position of secretary of the electoral board was awarded just one vote. In 1858, \"Gazeta de Moldavia\" was entirely dedicated to political subjects and support for Vogoride's policies, and ceased print in October, as the \"Kaymakam\" ended his mandate. In late November, it reemerged under the title \"Patria\", which continued to criticize \"Partida Naţională\" from a conservative position, notably hosting articles by the anti-unionist Istrati. As a new regency of three was preparing elections, the magazine rallied with Ştefan Catargiu, Asachi's lifelong collaborator and the separatist representative in the body of \"kaymakams\", against the two unionists (Vasile Sturdza and Anastasie Panu), before Catargiu was replaced with I. A. Cantacuzino. In November 1837, Asachi and another 36 separatist boyars issued a memorandum unsuccessfully asking the Ottoman Grand Vizier Aali Pasha to intervene against the unionist \"kaymakams\", restore censorship, and to narrow down the electoral lists.\n\nThe situation changed in January 1859, when \"Partida Naţională\" was able to ensure the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as both Prince of Moldavia and Prince of Wallachia, in what was the de facto union of the two countries. After congratulating Cuza on his accomplishment, Asachi authored a pome titled \"Odă la Dumnezeu\" (\"An Ode to God\"), which proclaimed the brotherhood of Romanians and the notion that \"power resides in Unity\". \"Patria\" drastically reduced its articles in support of separation, while allocating most of its space to reprinting official papers. Nevertheless, as \"Domnitor\" Cuza was deposed and the election of a foreign ruler over the Romanian Principality was being assessed, it is probable that Gheorghe Asachi again switched to a separatist stance: on April 14, 1866, after an incident during which Iaşi crowds protested the prolongation of unification beyond Cuza's reign, he was the subject of an inquiry on charges of sedition. This remains a mysterious aspect of his political career, and it is certain that Asachi eventually rallied with Carol later in the year. It is likely, however, that his inconsistent views prompted other intellectuals to reject his participation in founding the Romanian Academy.\n\nThe various projects also involved Asachi's own financial reserves, which led him to become indebted and mortgage his assets on several occasions: in 1862, after Asachi was declared insolvent, the Copou house was put up for auction, but the writer was able to come up with the money before the sale was perfected. He continued to depend on debts in order to feed his family, and unsuccessfully offered \"Institutul Albinei\" to be purchased by the state. In February 1869, the Dimitrie Ghica government awarded Asachi a yearly pension of 8,888 lei, \"for the important services he has brought to the country from 1813 to 1862\". He died several months later in Iaşi, and was buried at the Patruzeci de Sfinţi Church. His printing press ceased its activity in 1867.\n\nDuring his youth, Asachi was one of the most representative members of an idealist generation of Moldavian intellectuals. In the context of early Romanian literature, where Romanticism and delayed Classicism coexisted, Asachi, like Grigore Alexandrescu, George Baronzi and others, tended to side with the latter, at a time when his counterpart in Bucharest, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, bridged the gap between the two schools. The literary critic Garabet Ibrăileanu concluded that Asachi's literature signified a transition between a Classicist stage exemplified by Costache Conachi and younger Romantics such as Vasile Alecsandri and Dimitrie Bolintineanu (he also concluded that the casual comparisons made between Heliade Rădulescu and Asachi had failed to note that the former was not a conservative). Gheorghe Asachi recommended his students to study Italian literature, and would frown upon models inspired by French literature.\n\nHis creation comprised poems, the first of which were written in Italian, as well as vast array of short stories and novellas, through which Asachi attempted to create a legendary history partly mirroring Romanian mythology. The major influences on his work were Renaissance authors such as Petrarch, Ludovico Ariosto, and Torquato Tasso, but he also accommodated more modern influences, such as Salvator Rosa, Thomas Gray, Gottfried August Bürger, Vasily Zhukovsky, Lord Byron and Friedrich Schiller.\n\nThus, Asachi created himself a fictional location, called \"Dochia\" — a reference to both Dacia and the myth of Baba Dochia, which houses the Ceahlău Massif under the name of \"Pion\". Asachi was also the first person to mention Baba Dochia in connection to the Roman Emperor Trajan and the Dacian Wars — the vague and unprecedented references make it likely that he actually invented the original story as well. References to this universe are also present in an eponymous novella about Dragoş, the first Prince of Moldavia, which partly drew on old chronicles, and partly displayed Asachi's own fictional devices. The story centers on Harboe, a chivalrous Tatar ruler who resides in the Cumanian town of Romidava, who falls in love with Branda, the daughter of a Moesian lord and would-be wife of Dragoş. Dochia's hidden altar, referred to as \"a simulacrum\", is guarded by a Vestal-like priestess and a deer hind. Asachi's other prose works on historical subjects take similar liberties with their subjects (they notably describe large Gothic monuments and tournaments in medieval Moldavia, as well as improbable details from the lives of 14th-16th century Princes Bogdan I, Stephen the Great, and Petru Rareş).\n\nAsachi's works also include romanticized accounts of a journey made by the Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa into Moldavia (\"Mazepa în Moldova\") and the life of Ruxandra, daughter of Vasile Lupu and wife of Tymofiy Khmelnytsky (\"Rucsandra Doamna\"), as well as \"Jijia\", where a captured fairy recounts her previous existence as a Christian martyr, and \"Sirena lacului\", where a dishonored maiden, who has turned into a siren, takes revenge on boyar.\n\nIn connection with Nicolae Vogoride's policies, Asachi drew on historical subject to counter the calls for unity voiced by \"Partida Naţională\"; in addition to the endorsement he gave to the \"Chronicle of Huru\", he emphasized, in an article of June 1857, the campaign led by Stephen the Great into Wallachia, calling for a landmark to be raised in honor of \"the vanquisher of the Wallachians\". This mirrored the earlier comments made by the Wallachian anti-unionist Dimitrie Papazoglu, who proposed a celebration and monument honoring the 1653 Battle of Finta (during which the Wallachian forces of Matei Basarab had defeated an army of Moldavians and Cossacks).\n\nGheorghe Asachi's style has been criticized from the time of his debate with other intellectuals of his age, when Mihail Kogălniceanu argued that his lyrical works were mere replicas of foreign models. Several influential literary historians of the 20th century expressed similar views: George Călinescu indicated that, in general, poems by Asachi sounded \"banal\"; in one of his essays, Paul Zarifopol commented that Asachi and his generation, from Iancu Văcărescu to Vasile Cârlova, Alexandru Hrisoverghi, and Heliade Rădulescu, were \"semi-cultured\" and \"amateurs\". Both Călinescu and Zarifopol stressed that, in his best work, Asachi announced the poetic language of Mihai Eminescu, the most influential author of the late 19th century.\n\nPresent at the forefront during debates regarding the shape of literary language, Asachi drew criticism for introducing archaisms and marginally used neologisms to the Romanian lexis, as well as for the forms of spelling he encouraged. Commenting on a series of words which are nowhere used outside his novellas and poems, George Călinescu called them \"impossible [...], presently seeming bizarre, mostly Romantic, lacking in historical perception\".\n\nIn essence, Asachi called for the modern language to reflect as much as possible the one used by the folk — in this respect, he came closer to Kogălniceanu's views than to those of Heliade Rădulescu (at a time when the latter favored using the dialects employed by the Romanian Orthodox and Greek-Catholic churches). One of the first to discover old Moldavian chronicles and recommend them for reading, he came to propose that the Moldavian dialect, as reflected in these, could be used as a template for the modern speech. Nevertheless, his views fluctuated, and he was noted for proposing himself that the Church language be used as a template, while contrasting the support he gave to Westernization in general with his distaste for popular French-sounding neologisms.\n\nIn an article he published in 1847, Asachi defined himself as a partisan of \"the \"juste milieu\"\" on language matters, and recommended adopting words and rules of grammar with moderation, and from all sources available. According to the literary critic Garabet Ibrăileanu, \"[...] anybody who has ever read anything of what this writer has authored knows that he has a language of his own, a characteristic one, resembling those of many writers, without resemblig that of anyone else to the point where we could place him in any category.\" The same commentator nonetheless noted that there were clear similarities between the way in which Asachi used Romanian and the language favored by Costache Conachi.\n\nHis enduring aversion towards Western neologisms, as well as towards the Latin-based linguistic purism favored by many Transylvanian scholars, made Asachi a predecessor of the Bukovinan academic Aron Pumnul. However, in his later years, Asachi came to praise and uphold Heliade Rădulescu's controversial advocacy in favor of modifying Romanian on the basis of Italian (with its claim that the two languages were in fact closely related dialects of Latin).\nAsachi's experimentations with the Romanian Latin alphabet were noted for their inconsistencies, and criticized as such by Kogălniceanu (who, as an example, pointed out that Asachi had alternatively used \"tch\", \"tz\", \"c\", and \"cz\" to mark the voiceless postalveolar affricate).\n\nConsidered, together with the Wallachian Heliade Rădulescu, the founder of early Romanian theater, Asachi produced the first staging of a Romanian-language play, first performed for the public on December 27, 1816, at the Ghica family manor. The work was his own adaptation of \"Myrtil et Chloé\", a pastoral theme authored by Solomon Gessner and retaken by Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian; in its printed version, the text also featured illustrations drawn by his own hand. Extremely popular, Asachi's play was celebrated for helping to counter the perceived xenophily of the early 19th century Moldavian cultural environment. Two Ghicas and a Sturdza were assigned parts in the first staging, and Veniamin Costachi was present in the audience.\n\nIn early 1837, his conservatory began functioning regularly, which coincided with Asachi's leadership of the National Theatre. Before and after this moment, the writer contributed translations from various prestigious dramatists and playwrights, August von Kotzebue, Voltaire, Jean Racine and Nikolai Gogol among them. In parallel, he published librettos for popular operas, thus lending a hand to the development of local operatic theater.\n\nAs a teacher, Asachi assisted and encouraged the development of Romanian art. Before he came to exercise his influence, Moldavian art was essentially dependent on boyar patronage, and, by the turn of the 18th century, had come to focus on portrait painting. Asachi centered his energies on introducing Romantic nationalist themes and popularizing new trends. He integrated painting, architecture, and drawing and oil painting in classes taught at \"Academia Mihăileană\" (called \"class de zugrăvie\", an antiquated version of \"painting course\"), and introduced lithography through the means of his printing press.\n\nIn the 1830s and 1840s, he encouraged artists the copying and publishing of paintings and drawings with historical themes. Asachi emphasized the educational aspects of \"zugrăvitura istorică în oloiu\" (\"history painting in oil\"), and intended its creations to reach as wide an audience as possible. In this respect as well, his contributions were equivalent to those of Heliade Rădulescu, who opened the first museum in Wallachia (1837).\n\nThe resulting works are generally naïve in quality, and inaccurate in their reconstruction of historical scenes. Gheorghe Panaiteanu Bardasare, the recipient of a scholarship to the \"Akademie der Bildenden Künste\" in Munich, was the only one of his many disciples to remain under the influence of Asachi's tenets for the rest of his life, developing these into academic art. Asachi's disciples also included Gheorghe Lemeni, who studied in Munich and Rome, and the minor artist Gheorghe Năstăseanu.\n\nArguably, Asachi's most important contribution to the artistic field was his involvement in attracting foreign painters to the Moldavian scene, by offering them commissions or educational assignments; among these were the Polish Ludwik Stawski and Mauriciu Loeffler, the Italian Giovanni Schiavoni, as well as the Austrian Josef Adler (noted for authoring an 1833 manual for landscape painting and still life works) and Ioan Müller (who taught figurative art). Of them, Asachi reportedly considered Schiavoni to be the most competent, while he tended to replace most others after reexamining their skills. Another important Italian artist who arrived in Iaşi during that period was the former \"Carboneria\" revolutionary Niccoló Livaditti, to whom Asachi did not, however, assign a teaching post. In 1843, four years before the Iaşi \"Academia\" was radically transformed, the art classes were disestablished due to the protest of various boyars (who objected to the fact that members of all social groups could attend them).\n\nGheorghe Asachi's own works, many of which date back to the time he spent in Rome, show the influence of Classicism. Noted for their rigorous use of artistic conventions and nature study, they are nonetheless considered inferior to both their creator's contributions to other cultural fields and the works of other many painters active in Moldavia at the time. Asachi himself is known to have sketched out works which were completed by his foreign collaborators or students (among these is a since-lost painting of Stephen the Great facing his mother, signed by the Italian artist Giani, and an 1845 painting of Moldavians in the battle of Malbork Castle). A series of Classicist drawings from the early decades of the 19th century have only tentatively been attributed to Asachi.\n\nElena, Gheorghe Asachi's widow, died in 1877. Of his adopted children, Dimitrie Asachi was to be the most famous: a pupil of his stepfather's, he was to author the first original book on mathematics in his country (1841). Alexandru Asachi, who joined the Romanian Army and became an officer, was himself known as an artist: a lithographer and author of historical works, he published several albums of hand-colored prints during the 1850s.\n\nIn 1835, Hermiona Asachi (whose given name was often Francised as \"Hermione\") fell in love with Alexandru, the underage son of former Prince Alexander Mourousis, who soon after moved into Asachi's house; this scandalized other members of the Mourousis family, and the conflict was ended only when the two youths agreed to marry. They had a son, George Moruzi, who died in 1856. In 1843, Hermiona translated and published Silvio Pellico's collection of maxims, \"Dei doveri degli uomini\". She got married a second time, in 1852, to the well-known French historian Edgar Quinet (between 1841 and 1845, she had attended Quinet's lectures at the Collège de France); five years later, Asachi translated and Quinet's collected works into Romanian — according to historian Nicolae Iorga, the edition was toned-down and censored. The Quinets did not have any children.\n\nIn autumn 1890, a statue of Asachi was erected in front of the Trei Ierarhi Church school complex, an initiative taken by a group of his conservative collaborators. On the same occasion, Asachi's remains, together with those of his wife Elena, were placed in the monument's base. The courtyard of Asachi's house on Copou Hill hosts a small monument, which he raised to the memory of his daughter Eufrosina and his grandson George.\n\nAsachi laid out the plan for a monument honoring \"Regulamentul Organic\", completed by the Russian artist Sungurov with workforce hired from Galicia, and raised on Copou as the first structure of its kind in Moldavia. He is also noted for having proposed, in 1853, to create a modern cemetery in Iaşi on Galata Hill — his project was never used, but in 1871, Eternitatea, a cemetery corresponding to his requirements, was set up on land donated to the city.\n\nThe Copou house itself was taken over by Malvina Czapkai, a creditor of Asachi and his son Alexandru; it served as a boarding school, and, during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, as a Russian military hospital. In 1892, Marie of Edinburgh, who had just married the Romanian heir apparent, Ferdinand Hohenzollern, purchased it for 52,000 lei. It was subsequently the Principesa Maria School for Arts and Crafts, destined to women's education, and, during World War I, served as a home for orphaned girls. In 1937, Queen Marie transformed into an institute for welfare, which notably hosted the practice of sociologist and psychologist Mihai Ralea. The house was again a hospital in World War II, when it was taken over by the Romanian Air Force; in 1948, when the Communist regime was established, it was nationalized (together with all other Royal property), and served as the headquarters of the Romanian Land Forces 4th Corps, and was later rented for private use. Since 1976, it has housed two institutes of the Romanian Academy (the Alexandru Philippide Institute of Philology and the Gheorghe Zane Institute of Economic and Social Research).\n\nAmong the artists two have depicted Asachi during his lifetime were his associate Giovanni Schiavoni (whose painting shows the young writer surrounded by objects illustrating his many interests) and Constantin Daniel Stahi (a pupil of Panaiteanu Berdasare). In December 1937, a section of the University of Iaşi was created into an institute of technology, with the name of \"Gheorghe Asachi Polytechnic School\" (the present-day Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iaşi). A public library in the city also bears his name, as do a school erected in 1900 on the site previously occupied by \"Şcoala Vasiliană\" and high schools in the Romanian cities of Botoşani and Sibiu, as well as in the Moldovan capital Chişinău.\n\n\n"}

He confessed to the killings, which he claimed prevented earthquakes. In 1973, after a trial to determine whether he was insane or culpable, he was convicted of two murders in the first degree and nine in the second, and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nMullin was born in Salinas, California but grew up in Santa Cruz. His father, a World War II veteran, was strict but not abusive and frequently discussed his heroic war activities. Mullin had numerous friends at school and was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" by his classmates. Shortly after graduating from San Lorenzo Valley High School, however, one of his best friends was killed in a car accident, and Mullin was devastated. He built a shrine to his deceased friend in his bedroom. Later he expressed fears that he was homosexual, even though he had a longtime girlfriend at the time.\n\nIn 1969, at the age of 21, Mullin allowed his family to commit him to a mental hospital. Over the next few years, he entered various institutions, but discharged himself after only a short stay. He extinguished cigarettes on his own skin, attempted to enter the priesthood, and got evicted from an apartment after he repeatedly pounded on the floor, shouting at people who were not there.\n\nMany years later, FBI profiler Robert K. Ressler said Mullin had paranoid schizophrenia, manifesting as early as his senior year of high school, and could have been accelerated by the use of LSD or amphetamines.\n\nBy 1972, Mullin was 25 and had moved back in with his parents in Felton, California (located in the Santa Cruz mountains). By now he was hearing voices in his head that told him an earthquake was imminent, and that only through human sacrifice could he save California. Mullin's birthday, April 18, was the anniversary of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which he thought was very significant.\n\nMullin believed that the Vietnam War had produced enough American death to forestall earthquakes as a sort of blood sacrifice to nature, but that with the war winding down by late 1972, he would need to start killing people in order to have enough deaths to keep the earthquake away.\n\nOn October 13, 1972, Mullin beat Lawrence \"Whitey\" White, a homeless man, to death with a baseball bat. White, 55, had been hitchhiking on Highway 9 and Mullin struck him down after tricking him into looking at the car engine. Mullin was to claim later that the victim was Jonah from the Bible, and that he had sent Mullin a telepathic message saying, \"Pick me up and throw me over the boat. Kill me so that others will be saved.\" White's body was found the next day.\n\nThe next victim was Mary Guilfoyle, 24, a Cabrillo College student who was running late for an interview and decided to hitchhike. It was October 24, 1972. Mullin picked her up and stabbed her through the chest and the back. He then dissected her body and scattered her remains alongside a hillside road.\n\nOn November 2, Mullin went to confess his sins at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Los Gatos. In a delusional state, he believed the priest, Father Henri Tomei (a French Resistance veteran from Marseilles who came to America after the war and was in his eighth year as assistant pastor), wanted to volunteer to be his next sacrifice to keep away the earthquakes. He beat, kicked and stabbed Tomei, who bled to death in the confessional while a parishioner watched Mullin run away. The witness description of a tall young man in dark clothing and black boots did not help the police, who initially speculated Tomei was lured into the church or startled a burglar.\n\nAfter that, Mullin decided to join the U.S. Marines, and passed the physical and psychiatric tests. However, he was refused entry when it was found out that he had a number of minor arrests for his bizarre and disruptive behavior in the past. This rejection fueled Mullin's paranoid delusions of conspiracies, behind which he believed was a powerful group of hippies.\n\nBy January 1973, Mullin had stopped using drugs, and blamed them for his problems. Mullin had purchased several guns and decided to kill Jim Gianera, a high school friend who had sold him marijuana. However, when Mullin went to Gianera's house on January 25, 1973, he found that his old friend had moved away. The old cabin near the Mystery Spot on Mystery Spot Road, was now occupied by Kathy Francis (an old friend of Gianera). She gave him Gianera's new address, which was on Western Drive in Santa Cruz. There, Mullin killed both Gianera and his wife with shots to the head, then stabbed their bodies repeatedly. Mullin then went back to Francis' house, where he shot and killed her and her two sons, aged 9 and 4. Because Francis' husband — who was away at the time — was a drug dealer, the five murders were thought to be motivated by drug trafficking. Prosecutors later argued that the murder of Kathy Francis eliminated Mullin's claims of not guilty by reason of insanity because he killed her to remove a witness who could link him to the Gianera murders. In one published account of these murders, however, an FBI profiler states that Mullin killed the Francis family first and then executed the Gianera couple.\n\nAbout a month later, in early February 1973, Mullin was wandering around Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park where he encountered four teenage boys camping illegally in the park. He walked over to them, engaged in a brief conversation and claimed to be a park ranger. He ordered them to leave because they were \"polluting\" the forest, but they refused. He told them he would return the next day. The boys, who were armed with a .22 rifle, did not take this seriously. Mullin returned, shot them fatally, and abandoned their bodies, which were not found until the next week.\n\nThe final murder took place three days later, on February 13. Mullin was driving alone on the Santa Cruz westside when he drove past Fred Perez, a retired fisherman, who was weeding his lawn at his home on Gharkey Street. For no apparent reason, Mullin made a U-turn, stopped his station wagon, and laid his rifle across the hood to aim, killing the man instantly. Then he got back into his car and \"calmly\" drove off. It was broad daylight and there were a number of witnesses, one of whom gave police the license plate number. A \"docile\" Mullin was captured a few minutes later at the intersection of Highway 9 and Coral Street.\n\n\nIn custody, Mullin confessed to his crimes, and said that he had been told by voices in his head to kill people in order to prevent an earthquake. He claimed that the reason there had not been an earthquake recently was, in fact, due to his handiwork.\n\nThe Santa Cruz County District Attorney's office charged Mullin with ten murders, and his trial opened on July 30, 1973. Mullin had admitted to all the crimes and therefore the trial focused on whether he was sane and culpable for his actions. The fact that he had covered his tracks and shown premeditation in some of his crimes was highlighted by prosecutor Christopher Cottle, while the defense argued that Mullin had a history of mental illness, and that he had paranoid schizophrenia. On August 19, 1973, the verdict was delivered. Mullin was declared guilty of first-degree murder in the cases of Jim Gianera and Kathy Francis—because they were premeditated—while for the other eight murders Mullin was found guilty of second-degree murder because they were more impulsive.\n\nThe Santa Clara County District Attorney's office charged Mullin for the murder of Henri Tomei. On December 11, 1973, the day his trial was to begin, he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder after originally pleading not guilty by reason of insanity to first-degree murder.\n\nHe was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Santa Cruz County trial and has been denied parole ten times since 1980. He is incarcerated at Mule Creek State Prison, in Ione, California.\n\nAndy E. Horne played Mullin (renamed \"Herbert McCormack\") in the 2008 direct-to-video horror film \"\".\n"}
{"id": "1826071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826071", "title": "Hugo Schmeisser", "text": "Hugo Schmeisser\n\nHugo Schmeisser (24 September 1884 – 12 September 1953) was a German developer of 20th century infantry weapons.\n\nSchmeisser was born in Jena, Thuringia. His father, Louis Schmeisser (1848–1917), was one of the best-known weapons designers in Europe. The life and work of Hugo Schmeisser mostly took place in the weapons manufacturing city of Suhl, Thuringia.\n\nThe submachine guns of Theodor Bergmann are closely connected with its name recognition and weapons production in the time leading up to the First World War. Schmeisser also received his fundamental training in weapons technology at Bergmann, where 7.63 mm and 9 mm machine gun rounds were being researched. He remained in Suhl during World War I because of the crucial importance of his expertise in machine gun technology.\n\nManufacturing regulations in the Treaty of Versailles (June 28, 1919) forbade Germany from developing heavy machine guns, but permitted machine pistols or submachine guns as a suitable weapon for police. This signaled the end of a 30-year cooperation between the Schmeissers and Bergmann as production was licensed to foreign weapons manufacturers. Schmeisser decided to continue work in weapons development. Together with his brother Hans Schmeisser, he created the \" \"Industriewerk Auhammer Koch und Co\" \" (Industrial Auhammer Koch and Company) in Suhl. Being at the end of World War I, he saw little business, and encumbered by the Treaty of Versailles, the future of the company was unclear. Schmeisser defied the treaty, working to continue development of automatic weapons. It was at this time that the company began cooperating with: C. G. Haenel Waffen- u. Fahrradfabrik Suhl (page in German at German WIKI), beginning a 20-year partnership. For the safety of his patents, Schmeisser created a second company under the name of \"Brothers Schmeisser\" in the summer of 1922. This shrewd tactic was to prevent the loss of his patents if Auhammer went bankrupt. In order to prevent bankruptcy on both sides, Auhammer and Haenel merged, with Haenel taking full responsibility and liability for Auhammer business affairs. Schmeisser's attorneys who settled the deal became active shareholders in the company. Before long, it was obvious that development of many types of automatic weapons was unaffected or even accelerated by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1928 Schmeisser released the MP-28, which was used extensively by the German police. Bayard signed an agreement with Schmeisser to manufacture and sell weapons to South Africa, China, Spain, and Japan. It is notable that these same weapons were used during the Spanish Civil War only 10 years later. Despite Schmeisser's success, the company often came within inches of bankruptcy.\n\nAs the Nazis rose to power during 1933, ten weapons development enterprises in Suhl and Zella-Mehlis merged under the name of \"United Suhl-Zella Mehlis Armament Makers\". This central administration was used to coordinate production with the army's needs. This allowed Schmeisser to make a very important business acquaintance, which later developed to a friendship, with the aviator Ernst Udet, a deputy of Hermann Göring under Germany's \"Luftwaffe\". Schmeisser had a direct role in military production decisions, often influencing the decisions of Adolf Hitler and Göring. After 1935 Haenel experienced an enormous upswing in weapon production. Against the desires of many engineers and technical designers, the Schmeisser brothers continued to enforce patent royalties and manage company funds.\n\nBerthold Geipel of ErMa designed the MP 36 using Vollmer's EMP. The chief designer, Heinrich Vollmer, revised the basic construction of ErMa MP-36 and developed from it the well-known German submachine guns of the Second World War, the MP-38 and the MP-40. 1.2 million pieces were manufactured for these weapons, and were among the first weapons to be manufactured with die cast parts, metal stamping, and a complete machine-assembly. This method revolutionized weapon production, allowing manufacture at an unprecedented speed. They became internationally known as \"Schmeisser MP\"s, mainly due to the use of the straight magazine he had patented.\n\nSchmeisser's most important work had been underway since 1938. This new automatic weapon, with a short cartridge 7.92 mm, allowed for smart usage of resources and high production. At first named the Mkb 42, it later received the designation of MP-43, and it became one of the first assault rifles. By 1943, 10,000 pieces had already been manufactured for the front. For a short time, Hitler stopped production, as he was mysteriously opposed to the new weapon. In 1944, after troop testing verified the new weapon's legitimacy, Hitler authorized mass production of the MP-43 as well as further research into a new MP-44. In April 1944 the new weapon received the designation of \"Sturmgewehr 44\" (\"Assault Rifle 44\"). The StG 44 was arguably Schmeisser's most important weapon development.\n\nSchmeisser was one of 16 Germans for which a special department (no. 58) was created at factory number 74, later known as Izmash. Schmeisser was appointed as one of the five designers of the group, together with Kurt Horn and Werner Gruner (both from Grossfuss) and Oscar Schink (from Gustloff), under the formal leadership of Karl Barnitzke (also from Gustloff). There is some evidence that Schmeisser was uncooperative with the Soviets because he received the most negative review by his Soviet handlers in this group of five German designers. In these Soviet reviews, Schmeisser was described as a \"practical man\", whose lack of formal training showed whenever he was presented with any design problems.\n\nSchmeisser worked in Izhevsk until 1952 when he and other German specialists returned home to Germany. With short notice, his stay in the Soviet Union was extended beyond that of the other weapon specialists by a half year. He finally returned home on 9 June 1952. Schmeisser died on 12 September 1953, and was buried in Suhl. The 50th anniversary of his death was honored by a ceremony held in Suhl, as he is recognized as one of the most important technical designers of infantry weapons of the 20th century.\n\nSchmeisser had no role in the development of the MP-40 submachine gun despite its nickname \"Schmeisser\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25875117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25875117", "title": "Kimi and Ritz", "text": "Kimi and Ritz\n\nKimi and Ritz were a short-lived English pop vocal duo in the early 1970s, comprising Richard O'Brien (best known as the creator of cult stage musical \"The Rocky Horror Show\") and his then wife, Kimi Wong O'Brien. Although the duo only recorded six songs (of which two were never even released), they have since acquired something of a cult reputation in the light of O'Brien's subsequent success as a performer and songwriter.\n\nIn 1971, Richard O'Brien and his girlfriend Kimi Wong were struggling actors, performing in the English touring production of the stage musical \"Hair\". During this time they befriended fellow cast member John Sinclair and, through him, John's childhood friend Andrew (Andy) Leighton, a budding record engineer. When Sinclair left \"Hair\" after a knee injury and, he and Leighton attempted to establish their own recording studio, and then co-founded a music publishing company, Druidcrest Music. By this time, Richard O'Brien had left the cast of \"Hair\" to join the original London production of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", although he soon left when the management disagreed over his interpretation of Herod. He and Kimi were married on 4 December 1971. After the birth of their son the following April, Kimi re-joined the cast of \"Hair\" (playing the featured role of Chrissie) while O'Brien stayed home and looked after their son while working on the script that would eventually become \"The Rocky Horror Show\". During that time, John Sinclair and Andy Leighton were frequent visitors to O'Brien's flat and, after initially signing him to their publishing company, subsequently made him a full partner in it. The three men duly adopted the pseudonym of Andrew O'Bonzo to describe themselves, and launched a music production company, Rich Teaboy Productions.\n\nAt a time when it was still common for pop performers to approach record companies to obtain a one-off contract to release a single on their label, Andrew O'Bonzo struck up a deal with Epic Records (a division of CBS Records) for Richard O'Brien and his wife Kimi to release two songs that he had written. Produced under the auspices of Rich Teaboy Productions, the songs were arranged by London musician Robin Sylvester, later to become a prominent session guitarist and (since 2003) bass player for Ratdog. The single, released on 7 December 1973, comprised an original Christmas song, \"Merry Christmas Baby\" (sung by Kimi, with some harmonies and a spoken interlude by O'Brien) and, on the B side, Kimi's rendition of \"Eddie\" (aka \"Eddie's Teddy\"), one of the songs written for \"The Rocky Horror Show\". The latter song, released the same year as the show's original London cast album, can rightly be considered as the first of innumerable cover versions of songs from the cult show.\n\nAlong with general release, copies of the debut single were also sold from the foyer of the King's Road Theatre in Chelsea, where \"The Rocky Horror Show\" was being performed at the time, and were later given away to crew members when work was completed on the show's 1975 film adaptation, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". According to Kimi Wong, the single sold about 12,000 copies and not only got onto the BBC radio playlist but also scored a complimentary review from John Peel, a leading DJ of the day. In an effort to generate further Christmas airplay,the single was re-issued around the same time the following year, on 22 November 1974.\n\nDuring 1974, Rich Teaboy Productions secured a second one-off single deal from Epic Records. This time, the A-side was an original O'Brien composition with the lengthy title of \"I was in love with Danny (but the crowd was in love with Dean)\". Essentially a new take on the traditional teenage tragedy song, the song was performed as a duet and told the story of two competing race car drivers, one of whom was killed during the race. The B-side was \"Pseud's Corner\", named after a weekly column in the satirical magazine \"Private Eye\", which featured a solo vocal by O'Brien and some complex word play in its dark and obscure lyrics. This time around, the songs were arranged by O'Brien's friend Richard Hartley, former keyboardist for The Tornados, who had also served as arranger and musical director for the original stage production of \"The Rocky Horror Show\". The new single was released on 21 February 1975, but generated little attention or airplay.\n\nRich Teaboy Productions subsequently recorded another two songs by Kimi & Ritz for possible release; however, this time CBS Records did not take up the option. The proposed A-side was an updated version of the \"Liebesträume\" by Franz Liszt, with new lyrics by O'Brien. The B-side was to be another selection from \"The Rocky Horror Show\" score – a version of \"There's a Light\" (aka \"Over at the Frankenstein Place\"), albeit re-arranged for a string section and a vocal chorus that included Kimi Wong, Richard O'Brien, Belinda Sinclair and perhaps even John Sinclair and Andy Leighton themselves.\n\nDuring this period, Rich Teaboy Productions oversaw the recording and release of one-off singles credited to other artists including \"Truth & Beauty\" (1974), \"Dicky Hart and the Palpitations\" (1975) and Belinda Sinclair (with \"The Richard O'Brien Crusade\") (1979). Although O'Brien himself was involved in these projects in various capacities (as a writer, co-writer and/or vocalist), he and his wife never again recorded under the name Kimi & Ritz. Kimi Wong appeared in \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975), and in O'Brien's follow-up stage musical, \"T Zee\" (1976) before the couple divorced in 1979.\n\nSince 1975, the three Kimi & Ritz singles have never been commercially re-issued in any format, although they were later included on a limited edition bootleg CD entitled \" Dark Refrains\" (1996), which consisted of rare \"Rocky Horror\"-related audio tracks. Both the original 7-inch vinyl releases, and the bootleg CD (of which only 35 copies were pressed) remain extremely rare and sought-after collector's items, particularly amongst fans of \"The Rocky Horror Show\". In more recent years, the tracks (except for the still-unreleased \"Liebesträume\" and \"There's a Light\" recordings) have circulated as internet downloads from various websites.\n\n"}

She was assisted by her mother, Bridget Kathleen \"Kay\" Gilderdale, who was subsequently charged with attempted murder and was eventually given a one-year conditional discharge after admitting to assisting with her daughter's suicide.\n\nShe spent her early life in Burwash, East Sussex in south-eastern England. She later moved with her family to nearby Stonegate where she attended school. She participated in sailing and other sports, was captain of her school netball team, and won prizes for ballet.\n\nHer father, Richard Gilderdale, was a police officer in East Sussex and has been latterly employed in a civilian role for the force. Her mother was an auxiliary nurse, then an accountant, but from 1992 was Lynn's full-time carer.\n\nGilderdale fell ill in November 1991 after receiving the BCG vaccination. She attended school for only one or two days following this. She had a series of infections including flu, bronchitis, tonsillitis and glandular fever. The illness progressed rapidly, and from accounts by her mother, within six months \"she was totally bedridden, unable to lift her head off the pillow, or care for herself in any way at all. She was tube-fed, her legs were paralysed and she couldn’t sit up. She was unable to speak, read or write and her memory had gone\". At her worst, she was paralysed in all but her little finger, and suffered muscle spasms and severe light and sound sensitivity. However, by mid-1993, Lynn was able to move her arms again, as she was shown doing in a documentary on ME.\n\nLynn Gilderdale reported in 2008 that she had been sexually abused in a hospital at the age of 14; the police investigated, but made no arrests.\n\nLynn Gilderdale appeared in the media on various occasions during her illness, and features without being named in various printed literature on CFS, such as the book \"The New Plague\" by Jane Colby (First and Best in Education, 1996). She appeared by name on three occasions:\n\n\nKay Gilderdale wrote a book, \"One Last Goodbye\", which was published in the UK in April 2011. She also appeared in an independently-produced documentary, \"Voices from the Shadows\", about severe ME and the mistreatment of British patients, which premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival in 2011 and won the Audience Favorite International Documentary Award there, and was recently released on mail-order DVD in Europe.\n\nGilderdale remained bedridden, unable to speak or swallow, in constant pain and suffering other debilitating symptoms for the whole of the period from mid-1992 to her death in December 2008. She required, by her mother's reckoning, between 50 and 60 hospital admissions. On one such occasion in late 2005, her lung was punctured during an operation at Conquest Hospital, Hastings, to replace a Hickman line, resulting in her ending up on life support. Her mother reported that she also suffered broken bones due to osteoporosis. At the time, her parents \"said their goodbyes\" as they feared she would not survive. She did survive, but Lynn found the experience traumatic and she subsequently expressed the wish not to be resuscitated in case of future similar circumstances.\n\nHowever, her paralysis partly receded, the family were able to take care of her medical needs at home and reduce her hospital admissions to two or three per year, and her memory improved, enabling her to re-learn to read and to type. She used a pocket computer to communicate with friends over the Internet.\n\nAccording to Kay Gilderdale:\n\nLynn attempted suicide in May 2007 with an overdose of morphine and an injection of air. After this failure, she later wrote, she never wavered in her desire to die. She posted an explanation towards the end of her life, explaining that she was \"so very, very tired\" and that her spirit was broken (see below).\n\nLynn died at 0710 on 4 December 2008. Kay's prosecution for attempted murder hinged on her actions during those hours, as she gave the family doctor the impression that she had injected Lynn with air, to cause a fatal embolism and with the antidepressant Sertraline. However, Lynn's body revealed no trace of the latter and Kay later said she could not remember injecting Lynn with air.\n\nKay was charged with attempted murder on 21 April 2009. \n\nThe trial itself began on 12 January 2010. The prosecution opened their case on 18 January, making the accusation of deliberate injections of air. Prosecution Sally Howes QC told the jury:\n\nOn 19 January, Lynn Gilderdale's father, Richard, who had been divorced from Kay but was still involved in Lynn's care, testified in Kay's defence. He testified that Lynn had developed a fear of hospitals after a series of incidents including the Oct 2005 Hickman line incident and had been sexually abused by a senior health professional in London. With regard to her quality of life, he replied, \"It was less than poor. She had no quality of life. She couldn’t eat, she couldn’t drink.\" Richard Gilderdale, and Julie Cheeseman another of Lynn Gilderdale's carers, related that they had both tried to dissuade her from taking her own life. On the third day, the prosecution told the jury that Kay had searched the Internet for various suicide-related phrases in between Lynn's overdose and her death. Closing speeches were given by defence and prosecution on 23 January and Kay was acquitted of the attempted murder charge on 25 Jan.\n\nFollowing Kay Gilderdale's acquittal, the judge made a statement praising the jury. Mr Justice Bean remarked: \"I do not normally comment on the verdicts of juries but in this case their decision, if I may say so, shows that common sense, decency and humanity which makes jury trials so important in a case of this kind.\"\n\n\n"}

He is credited with redefining the \"range and depth of Tamil cinema\", and is regarded as one of the greatest Indian filmmakers. As of 2018, he has directed 26 films, and produced over 15 under his production company Madras Talkies.\n\nMani Ratnam made his directorial debut, without formal training or education in filmmaking, with the Kannada film \"Pallavi Anu Pallavi\" (1983). The critically acclaimed film, which he also wrote, won him the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Screenplay. Following a string of commercial failures, he had his first box-office success with the 1985 Tamil film \"Idaya Kovil\". The following year, he made the romantic drama \"Mouna Ragam\", which narrated the story of a young woman who is forced into an arranged marriage by her family. The critical and commercial success of the film established him as a leading filmmaker in Tamil cinema. His next release \"Nayakan\", starring Kamal Haasan, was inspired by the life of the Bombay-based gangster Varadarajan Mudaliar. The film was submitted by India as its official entry for the 60th Academy Awards. Later in 2005, \"Nayakan\" was included in \"Time\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"All-Time 100 Movies\" list. Mani Ratnam followed this with the tragic romance \"Geethanjali\" (1989), which marked his Telugu cinema debut; the tragedy \"Anjali\" (1990), which narrated the story of an autistic child; and the crime drama \"Thalapathi\" (1991), loosely adapted from the Indian epic \"Mahabharata\". In 1992, he made the romantic thriller \"Roja\" for Kavithalayaa Productions. The film was dubbed into many Indian languages, including Hindi, and its widespread success brought national recognition to Mani Ratnam. Three years later, he made \"Bombay\" (1995), which was based on the 1992–93 Bombay riots. Although controversial for its depiction of religious riots, the film met with wide critical acclaim and became commercially successful in India.\n\nIn 1997, Mani Ratnam co-produced and directed the political drama film \"Iruvar\", which was loosely based on the relationship between cinema and politics in Tamil Nadu. The following year, he made his Bollywood debut with \"Dil Se..\", the third film in his \"terrorism trilogy\". A box-office failure in India, the film emerged as a success overseas; it became the first Indian film to be placed among the top 10 at the United Kingdom box-office. In 2002, Mani Ratnam directed the critically acclaimed drama \"Kannathil Muthamittal\", which was set against the backdrop of the Sri Lankan Civil War. The commercial failure was the most successful film at the 50th National Film Awards, winning six honours including the award for the Best Feature Film in Tamil. He returned to Bollywood after a six-year hiatus with the political drama \"Yuva\" (2004); the project was simultaneously filmed in Tamil as \"Aaytha Ezhuthu\" with a different cast. His next release was the biographical film \"Guru\" (2007), a drama inspired by the life of the industrialist Dhirubhai Ambani. In 2010, Mani Ratnam worked on the Tamil-Hindi bilingual \"Raavanan\"/\"Raavan\", which was based on the Indian epic \"Ramayana\". Three years later, he produced and directed the crime drama \"Kadal\", a critical and box office failure. This was followed by \"O Kadhal Kanmani\" (2015), a romantic drama about a cohabiting couple. The critically acclaimed film was his first commercial success in the 2010s.\n"}

{"id": "508306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=508306", "title": "Otto Fetting", "text": "Otto Fetting\n\nOtto Fetting (November 20, 1871 – January 30, 1933) was an American realtor and editor from Port Huron, Michigan who served first as a pastor and evangelist in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and then later as an apostle in the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), commonly referred to as the \"Hedrickites\". Fetting claimed to have been visited by John the Baptist thirty or more times between February 4, 1927 and his death on January 30, 1933. Fetting was reportedly given instruction concerning the doctrine and practices of Hedrickites and other factions of Christianity, together with directives to begin construction of a temple on the Temple Lot, including its exact dimensions. \n\nAfter initially accepting his first eleven revelations, a Hedrickite conference vote in early October 1929 rejected a key portion of Fetting's twelfth message, leading him to found the \"Church of Jesus Christ\" on April 8, 1930. This breakaway faction, later referred to as \"Church of Christ\", subsequently gave birth to additional rival factions after Fetting's death, which have still further subdivided. These \"Fettingite\" or \"Dravesite\" (named after W.A. Draves, a follower of Fetting) factions include: the Church of Christ \"With the Elijah Message\" Established Anew 1929; the Church of Christ (Restored); the Church of Christ (Assured Way); \"The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Established in 1929 Anew, The Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, Inc. and the Church of Christ at Halley's Bluff. \n\nOtto Fetting was born in Casco, Michigan. Eventually making his home in nearby Port Huron, Michigan, he was baptised into the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on February 9, 1891, and ordained to its priesthood in 1899. In 1925, dismayed by the \"Supreme Directional Control\" controversy within the RLDS church, Fetting switched his allegiance to the Temple Lot organization. At the time, this did not require rebaptism or reordination, as each group accepted the priesthood and sacraments of the other. In the spring of 1926, he was among seven men ordained to be Apostles in the Church of Christ.\n\nOn February 4, 1927, Otto Fetting claimed that he had been visited by John the Baptist, who delivered a message for him to give to the Hedrickite organization. This message commanded construction of the long-awaited Temple in Independence, Missouri, first foretold by Latter Day Saint founder Joseph Smith in 1831. The Temple Lot church had a long history of direction via revelation and angel visits, and thus was originally receptive to these alleged visits of the Biblical prophet, publishing Fetting's messages in their monthly periodical \"Zion's Advocate\". They also began work on the temple with a groundbreaking ceremony held on April 6, 1929. According to Fetting, the Hedrickites were given seven years to complete the structure.\n\nFetting's \"visitor\" revealed various architectural details for the building, and specifically directed surveyors to move their markers ten feet to the east of where they had originally been placed. The angel also revealed the location of two of Joseph Smith's original marker stones, which Smith had buried ninety-eight years before to indicate the location for his planned temple. He also indicated that the \"Articles of Faith and Practice\" of the Temple Lot church were correct, and should not be changed from their original form. On other occasions, the messenger indicated particular men to be ordained within the organization, including to its Quorum of Twelve Apostles.\n\nAlthough the Temple Lot organization had enthusiastically accepted the first eleven of Fetting's messages, this would not hold true for the twelfth. In verse four of this missive, John the Baptist states that all persons coming into the Church of Christ must be rebaptized, as \"the Lord has rejected all creeds and factions of men\". While this reflects the practice of the majority of Latter Day Saint denominations (including the Temple Lot church itself, today), it did not reflect the policy of the Temple Lot church at the time, which accepted members during this period from the Reorganized church, certain other Latter Day Saint organizations, and Joseph Smith's pre-1844 church on their original baptisms. This message equally declared Fetting to have been given the same \"keys to the priesthood\" that were given to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on May 15, 1829. \n\nControversy over the meaning and application of Fetting's twelfth message became so great that Fetting himself was \"silenced\" in October 1929 by the Temple Lot organization. Choosing to withdraw rather than continue under such a restriction, Fetting led approximately half of the Church of Christ members (including some of its apostles) to found an organization of his own, which became known as the Church of Christ (Fettingite). Since the main Temple Lot organization retained possession of the Temple Lot and its meetinghouse, Fetting's organization met in members' homes for a considerable period prior to building their own worship facilities. \n\nFetting would be visited a total of 30 times by his \"messenger\" prior to his death on January 30, 1933. To the end of his life, Fetting insisted upon the veracity of his heavenly visitor, and the truth of the messages he was given. He authored the following testimony in 1929:\n\nFour other people claimed to have seen John the Baptist during his final visit to Fetting, and their testimony was notarized.\n\nFour years after Fetting's death, a young Fettingite Elder named William A. Draves from Nucla, Colorado claimed that the same messenger who had appeared to Fetting had begun to appear to him, as well. While many of Fetting's followers accepted Draves and his messages, some did not, leading to a split in the Fettingite organization in 1939. Draves' adherents formed the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message, which claims to be the sole legitimate continuance of Fetting's original organization. Draves himself would receive a total of 90 messages prior to his death in 1994, all of which were combined with Fetting's into a book entitled The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel.\n\nThe Fettingites who rejected Draves' claims later split into two separate organizations, divided by the decision of the Church of Christ (Fettingite)—the remnant in Independence who rejected William Draves' claims—to introduce the Saturday Sabbath into their organization during the 1950s under Apostle S.T. Bronson. A group of congregations in Louisiana and Mississippi, under the leadership of A.C. DeWolf, rejected this change and formed the Church of Christ (Restored), which continues to observe Sunday as their day of worship.\n\nOther than disagreeing as to the proper day for worship, the \"Bronsonite\" and \"DeWolf\" organizations remain virtually identical in doctrine and practice. Both of them accept Fetting's ministry and messages, but not Draves'. Each rejects the other, and considers itself the sole true continuation of Otto Fetting's church. Draves' organization, on the other hand, rejects both of these groups, accepting their founder's messages \"and\" those of Otto Fetting. \n\nThe Church of Christ at Halley's Bluff has no connection with any of these organizations, though it does accept Fetting's message (but not those of Draves).\n\n"}

Moore was the bank’s Head of Group Regulatory Risk and was fired from the role by HBOS Group Chief Executive Office James Crosby following his warnings to the Board about HBOS’s risky sales strategies.\n\nIn 2009 Moore’s evidence about HBOS was presented to the UK House of Commons Treasury Select Committee and resulted in James Crosby resigning as Deputy Chairman of the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority). Crosby, who was also an adviser to the then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, later gave up his knighthood and part of his pension after a Parliamentary report was highly critical of his, HBOS Chairman Lord Dennis Stevenson and HBOS CEO Andy Hornby’s management of the bank. Since his dismissal Moore has been shunned by the financial community and has been unable to find another job in the sector. He has endured depression and alcoholism. He has continued to fight for change in the financial system and to bring those responsible for the 2008 crisis to justice.\n\nIn 2015 Moore wrote his memoirs in a book called Crash Bank Wallop and has launched The New Wilberforce Movement to free the world from the slavery of greed.\n\nPaul Russell Moore was born in Bristol, England on 30 October 1958. He was educated at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire and studied law at Bristol University.\n\nAfter becoming a barrister he became the in-house lawyer in the product development department of Allied Dunbar in December 1984. He left in December 1988 to join Kleinworth Benson as its in-house lawyer but was only there until April 1989 when he was headhunted by start-up firm Ellastone. In February 1990 he moved to American Express subsidiary Acuma as General Counsel and Head of Compliance and was there until February 1994. In February 1995 Moore joined accountancy firm KPMG becoming its top-performing Partner.\n\nMoore joined HBOS in July 2002 as Head of Risk in the Insurance and Investment Division. He was appointed to the role of Head of Group Regulatory Risk at the end of 2003. He had formal responsibility for the bank's policy and oversight of executive management's compliance with FSA regulation. It was during 2004 whilst conducting reviews of the bank’s sales culture and selling practices that Moore and his team uncovered mis-selling and other unfair customer sales tactics. However, when Moore reported these findings, as his job demanded, he was fired on 8 November 2004.\n\nMoore's complaints were investigated at the time (before the crisis) by accountancy firm KPMG, who concluded that HBOS had appropriate risk controls in place; this was accepted by the Financial Services Authority.\n\nIn November 2004 Moore was dismissed by HBOS. He claimed this was because he had told HBOS's board that the bank was taking excessive risks with its aggressive sales culture which was out of balance with its systems and controls. He passed his concerns about HBOS to the FSA, who had it investigated by KPMG, whose conclusion, that HBOS had appropriate risk controls in place, was accepted by the FSA. Following his dismissal the bank replaced him with a retail sales manager.\n\nHe sued HBOS for unfair dismissal on the basis that the reason for his dismissal was actually his warnings of excessive risk, which if followed would have reduced the bank's profits while protecting it from what proved to be the all-too-real risk. The bank settled his claim for over half a million pounds in mid-2005.\n\nIn 2008, HBOS was forced into a merger and then bailed out by a multibillion-pound infusion of capital from the Treasury.\n\nAlthough Moore had agreed to the non-disclosure agreement as part of his settlement, he decided to speak out after the crisis because he believed it to be in the public interest and on 10 February 2009 Moore submitted a memorandum of evidence to the UK's Treasury Select Committee, which was investigating risks taken by UK banks prior to the credit crunch.\n\nMoore runs a risk consultancy, Moore Carter and Associates, and was the non-executive Chairman of Assetz Capital, a peer-to-peer lender aimed at SMEs and property developers in the UK. Moore is married with three children and currently lives in North Yorkshire.\n\nMoore announced his intention to publish a book about the HBOS whistle blowing and subsequent events called \"Crash, Bank, Wallop\".

Since 1973, the Grants have spent six months of every year capturing, tagging, and taking blood samples from finches on the island. They have worked to show that natural selection can be seen within a single lifetime, or even within a couple of years. Charles Darwin originally thought that natural selection was a long, drawn out process. The Grants have shown that these changes in populations can happen very quickly.\n\nIn 1994, they were awarded the Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

Despite what teachers told her at school, she was destined to go to university to obtain a degree. She graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in Zoology in 1960. For the next year, she studied genetics under Conrad Waddington and then devised a dissertation to study isolated populations of fish. This project was put on hold when she accepted a biology teaching job at the University of British Columbia, where she met Peter Grant.\n\nPeter Raymond Grant was born in 1936 in London, but relocated to the English countryside to avoid bombings during World War II. He attended school at the Surrey-Hampshire border where he collected insects and studied flowers. He attended the University of Cambridge, then moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and began work on a doctoral degree in Zoology at the University of British Columbia. A few days after beginning his research he met Rosemary; they were married a year later.\n\n\n\nFor his doctoral degree, Peter Grant studied the relationship between ecology and evolution and how they were interrelated. The Grants travelled to the Tres Marias Islands off Mexico to conduct field studies of the birds that inhabited the island. They compared the differences of bill length to body size between populations living on the Islands and the nearby mainland. Of the birds studied, eleven species were not significantly different between the mainland and the islands; four species were significantly less variable on the islands, and one species was significantly more variable. On average, the birds on the islands had larger beaks. The Grants attributed these differences to what foods were available, and what was available was dependent on competitors. The bigger beaks indicated a greater range of foods present in the environment.\n\nIn 1965, Peter Grant accepted tenure at McGill University in Montreal. He created a method to test the Competition Hypothesis to see if it worked today as it did in the past. This research was done on grassland voles and woodland mice. The study looked at the competitiveness between populations of rodents and among rodent species. In his article \"Interspecific Competition Among Rodents\", he concluded that competitive interaction for space is common among many rodent species, not just the species that have been studied in detail. Grant also states that there are many causes for increased competition: reproduction, resources, amount of space, and invasion of other species.\n\nDaphne Major, in the Galápagos Islands, was a perfect place to perform experiments and study changes within birds. It was isolated and uninhabited; any changes that were to occur to the land and environment would be due to natural forces with no human destruction. The island provided the best environment to study natural selection; seasons of heavy rain switched to seasons of extended drought. With these environmental changes brought changes in the types of foods available to the birds. The Grants would study this for the next few decades of their lives.\n\nIn 1973, the Grants headed out on what they thought would be a two-year study on the island of Daphne Major. There they would study evolution and ultimately determine what drives the formation of new species. There are thirteen species of finch that live on the island; five of these are tree finch, one warbler finch, one vegetarian finch, and six species of ground finch. These birds provide a great way to study adaptive radiation. Their beaks are specific to the type of diet they eat, which in turn is reflective of the food available. The finches are easy to catch and provide a good animal to study. The Grants tagged, labelled, measured, and took blood samples of the birds they were studying. The two-year study continued through 2012.\n\nDuring the rainy season of 1977 only 24 millimetres of rain fell. Two of the main finch species were hit exceptionally hard and many of them died. The lack of rain caused major food sources to become scarce, causing the need to find alternative food sources. The smaller, softer seeds ran out, leaving only the larger, tougher seeds. The finch species with smaller beaks struggled to find alternate seeds to eat. The following two years suggested that natural selection could happen very rapidly. Because the smaller finch species could not eat the large seeds, they died off. Finches with larger beaks were able to eat the seeds and reproduce. The population in the years following the drought in 1977 had \"measurably larger\" beaks than had the previous birds.\n\nIn 1981, the Grants came across a bird they had never seen before. It was heavier than the other ground finches by more than five grams. They called this bird Big Bird. It had many different characteristics than those of the native finches: a strange call, extra glossy feathers, it could eat both large and small seeds, and could also eat the nectar, pollen, and seeds of the cacti that grow on the island. Big Bird is thought to be a hybrid of the medium-beaked ground finch and the cactus finch. Although hybrids do happen, many of the birds living on the island tend to stick within their own species. Big Bird lived for thirteen years, and his descendants have only mated within themselves for the past thirty years, a total of seven generations.\n\nOver the course of 1982–1983, El Niño brought a steady eight months of rain. In a normal rainy season Daphne Major usually gets two months of rain. The excessive rain brought a turnover in the types of vegetation growing on the island. The seeds shifted from large, hard to crack seeds to many different types of small, softer seeds. This gave birds with smaller beaks an advantage when another drought hit the following year. Small-beaked finch could eat all of the small seeds faster than the larger beaked birds could get to them.\n\nIn 2003, a drought similar in severity to the 1977 drought occurred on the island. However, in the time between the droughts (beginning in late 1982), the large ground finch (\"Geospiza magnirostris\") had established a breeding population on the island. This species has diet overlap with the medium ground finch (\"G. fortis\"), so they are potential competitors. The 2003 drought and resulting decrease in food supply may have increased these species' competition with each other, particularly for the larger seeds in the medium ground finches' diet. Following the drought, the medium ground finch population had a decline in average beak size, in contrast to the increase in size found following the 1977 drought. This was hypothesized to be due to the presence of the large ground finch; the smaller-beaked individuals of the medium ground finch may have been able to survive better due to a lack of competition over large seeds with the large ground finch. This is an example of character displacement.\n\nIn \"Evolution: Making Sense of Life\", the takeaway from the Grants' 40-year study can be broken down into three major lessons. The first is that natural selection is a variable, constantly changing process. The fact that they studied the island in both times of excessive rain and drought provides a better picture of what happens to populations over time. The next lesson learned is that evolution can actually be a fairly rapid process. It does not take millions of years; these processes can be seen in as little as two years. Lastly, and as the author states, most importantly, selection can change over time. During some years, selection will favour those birds with larger beaks. Other years with substantial amounts of smaller seeds, selection will favour the birds with the smaller beaks.\n\nIn their 2003 paper, the Grants wrap up their decades-long study by stating that selection oscillates in a direction. For this reason, neither the medium ground finch nor the cactus finch has stayed morphologically the same over the course of the experiment. The average beak and body size are not the same today for either species as they were when the study first began. The Grants also state that these changes in morphology and phenotypes could not have been predicted at the beginning. They were able to witness the evolution of the finch species as a result of the inconsistent and harsh environment of Daphne Major directly.\n\nSocieties and Academies:\nHonorary Degrees\nAssociate Editor of Scientific Journals\nHonorary citizen of Puerto Bacquerizo, I.

{"id": "82536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82536", "title": "Puerto Ricans", "text": "Puerto Ricans\n\nPuerto Ricans (; or boricuas) are people from Puerto Rico, the inhabitants and citizens of Puerto Rico, and their descendants. Puerto Rico is home to people of many different national origins.\n\nThe culture held in common by most Puerto Ricans is referred to as mainstream Puerto Rican culture, a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of Spain, and more specifically Andalusia and the Canary Islands. Over 90% of Puerto Ricans descend from migrants from these two southern regions of Spain. Puerto Rico has also been influenced by African culture, Afro-Puerto Ricans being a significant minority. Puerto Rico has also received immigration from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia as well as from other European countries such as France, Ireland, Italy and Germany. Recent studies in population genetics have concluded that Puerto Rican gene pool is on average predominantly European, with a significant Sub-Saharan African, Guanche and Indigenous American substrate, the latter two originating in the aboriginal people of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico's pre-Hispanic Taíno inhabitants, respectively.\n\nThe population of Puerto Ricans and descendants is estimated to be between 8 and 10 million worldwide, with most living on the islands of Puerto Rico and in the United States mainland. Within the United States, Puerto Ricans are present in all states of the Union, and the states with the largest populations of Puerto Ricans relative to the national population of Puerto Ricans in the United States at large are the states of New York, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, with large populations also in Massachusetts, Connecticut, California, Illinois, and Texas.\n\nFor 2009, the American Community Survey estimates give a total of 3,859,026 Puerto Ricans classified as \"Native\" Puerto Ricans. It also gives a total of 3,644,515 (91.9%) of the population being born in Puerto Rico and 201,310 (5.1%) born in the United States. The total population born outside Puerto Rico is 322,773 (8.1%). Of the 108,262 who were foreign born outside the United States (2.7% of Puerto Ricans), 92.9% were born in Latin America, 3.8% in Europe, 2.7% in Asia, 0.2% in Northern America, and 0.1% in Africa and Oceania each.\n\nThe populations during Spanish rule of Puerto Rico were:\n\nThe original inhabitants of Puerto Rico are the Taíno, who called the island \"Borikén\"; however, as in other parts of the Americas, the native people soon diminished in number after the arrival of European settlers. Besides miscegenation, the negative impact on the numbers of Amerindian people, especially in Puerto Rico, was almost entirely the result of Old World diseases that the Amerindians had no natural/bodily defenses against, including measles, chicken pox, mumps, influenza, and even the common cold. In fact, it was estimated that the majority of all the Amerindian inhabitants of the New World died out due to contact and contamination with those Old World diseases, while those that survived were further reduced through deaths by warfare with each other and with Europeans.\n\nBoth run-away and freed African slaves (the Spanish, upon establishing a foothold, quickly began to import African slaves to work in expanding their colonies in the Caribbean) were in Puerto Rico. This interbreeding was far more common in Latin America because of those Spanish and Portuguese mercantile colonial policies exemplified by the oft-romanticized male conquistadors (e.g. Hernán Cortés). Aside from the presence of slaves, some indication for why the Amerindian population was so diluted was the tendency for conquistadors to bring with them scores of single men hoping to serve God, country, or their own interests. All of these factors would indeed prove detrimental for the Taínos in Puerto Rico and surrounding Caribbean islands.\n\nIn the 16th century, a significant depth of Puerto Rican culture began to develop with the import of African slaves by the Spanish, as well as by the French, the Portuguese, the British, and the Dutch. Thousands of Spanish settlers also immigrated to Puerto Rico from the Canary Islands during the 18th and 19th centuries, so many so that whole Puerto Rican villages and towns were founded by Canarian immigrants, and their descendants would later form a majority of the population on the island.\n\nIn 1791, the slaves in Saint-Domingue (Haiti), revolted against their French masters. Many of the French escaped to Puerto Rico via what is now the Dominican Republic and settled in the west coast of the island, especially in Mayagüez. Some Puerto Ricans are of British heritage, most notably Scottish people and English people who came to reside there in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWhen Spain revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 with the intention of attracting non-Hispanics to settle in the island, thousands of Corsicans (though the island was French since 1768 the population spoke an Italian dialect similar to Tuscan Italian) during the 19th century immigrated to Puerto Rico, along with German immigrants as well as Irish immigrants who were affected by the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s, immigrated to Puerto Rico. They were followed by smaller waves from other European countries and China.\n\nDuring the early 20th century Jews began to settle in Puerto Rico. The first large group of Jews to settle in Puerto Rico were European refugees fleeing German–occupied Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. The second influx of Jews to the island came in the 1950s, when thousands of Cuban Jews fled after Fidel Castro came to power.\n\nThe native Taino population began to dwindle, with the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, through disease and miscegenation. Many Spaniard men took Taino and West African wives and in the first centuries of the Spanish colonial period the island was overwhelmingly racially mixed. However, under Spanish rule, mass immigration shifted the ethnic make-up of the island, as a result of the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. Puerto Rico went from being two-thirds black and mulatto in the beginning of the 19th century, to being nearly 80% white by the middle of the 20th century. This was compounded by more flexible attitudes to race under Spanish rule, as epitomized by the \"Regla del Sacar\" laws. Under Spanish rule, Puerto Rico had laws such as \"Regla del Sacar\" or \"Gracias al Sacar\", which made persons of mixed African-European ancestry to be classified as white, which was the opposite of \"one-drop rule\" in US society after the American Civil War.\n\nStudies have shown that the racial ancestry mixture of the average Puerto Rican (regardless of racial self-identity) is about 64% European, 21% West and North African (including Canary Islander Guanche), and 15% Taino/Amerindian, with European ancestry strongest on the west side of the island and West African ancestry strongest on the east side, and consistent levels of Taino ancestry throughout the island.\n\nA study of a sample of 96 healthy self-identified White Puerto Ricans and self-identified Black Puerto Ricans in the U.S. showed that, although all carried a contribution from all 3 ancestral populations (European, African, and Amerindian), the proportions showed significant variation. Depending on individuals, although often correlating with their self-identified race, African ancestry ranged from less than 10% to over 50%, while European ancestry ranged from under 20% to over 80%. Amerindian ancestry showed less fluctuation, generally hovering between 5% and 20% irrespective of self-identified race.\n\nIn the 1899 census, one year after the U.S invaded and took control of the island, 61.8% of the people self-identified as White. In the 2010 United States Census the total of Puerto Ricans that self-identified as White was 75.8% or 2,825,100 out of the 3,725,789 people living in Puerto Rico. down from 80.5% in the 2000 Census.\n\nThe European ancestry of Puerto Ricans comes primarily from one source: Spaniards (including Canarians, Catalans, Castilians, Galicians, Asturians, Andalusians, and Basques).\nThe Canarian cultural influence in Puerto Rico is one of the most important components in which many villages were founded from these immigrants, which started from 1493 to 1890 and beyond. Many Spaniards, especially Canarians, chose Puerto Rico because of its Hispanic ties and relative proximity in comparison with other former Spanish colonies. They searched for security and stability in an environment similar to that of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico was the most suitable. This began as a temporary exile which became a permanent relocation and the last significant wave of Spanish or European migration to Puerto Rico.\n\nOther sources of European populations are Corsicans, French, Italians, Portuguese (especially Azoreans), Greeks, Germans, Irish, Scots, Maltese, Dutch, English, Danes, and Jews.\n\nIn the 2010 United States Census, 12.4% of people self-identified as Black. African immigrants were brought by Spanish Conquistadors. The vast majority of the Africans who were brought to Puerto Rico did so as a result of the slave trade taking place from many groups in the African continent, but particularly the West Africans, the Yoruba, the Igbo, and the Kongo people.\n\nAmerindians and Mestizos are those who have a pure Amerindian descent or mixed ancestry between Europeans and Amerindians within the Puerto Rican context discarding the other definitions that this term may be used for under other settings. Amerindians make up the third largest racial identity among Puerto Ricans comprising 0.5% of the population. Although this self-identification may be political in nature since native Tainos no longer exist as an ethnic group.\n\nFor its 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau listed the following groups to constitute \"Asian\": Asian Indian, Bangladeshi, Bhutanese, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Malaysian, Nepalese, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Taiwanese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Other Asian. Though, the largest groups come from China and India. These groups represented 0.2% of the population.\n\nPeople of \"Some other race alone\" or \"Two or more races\" constituted 11.1% of the population in the 2010 Census.\n\nAlthough most Puerto Ricans are mixed-race, few actually identify as multiracial (\"two or more races\"); only 3.3% did so in the 2010 Census. They more often \nself-identify with their predominant heritage or phenotype. Most have significant ancestry from two or more of the founding source populations of Spaniards, Africans, and Tainos, although Spanish ancestry is predominant in a majority of the population.\n\nVery few self-identified white Puerto Ricans are of unmixed European ancestry. In genetic terms, even many of those of pure Spanish origin may have North and West African ancestry brought from founder populations originating in the Canary Islands. Very few self-identified Black Puerto Ricans are of unmixed African ancestry, while a genetically unmixed Amerindian population in Puerto Rico is technically extinct despite a minuscule segment of self-identified Amerindian Puerto Ricans due to a predominant Amerindian component in their ancestral mixture.\n\nThe Puerto Rico of today has come to form some of its own social customs, cultural matrix, historically rooted traditions, and its own unique pronunciation, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions within the Spanish language, known as Puerto Rican Spanish. Even after the attempted assimilation of Puerto Rico into the United States in the early 20th century, the majority of the people of Puerto Rico feel pride in their nationality as \"Puerto Ricans\", regardless of the individual's particular racial, ethnic, political, or economic background. Many Puerto Ricans are consciously aware of the rich contribution of all cultures represented on the island. This diversity can be seen in the everyday lifestyle of many Puerto Ricans such as the profound Latin, African, and Taíno influences regarding food, music, dance, and architecture.\n\nThe official languages of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law. All official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population.\n\nPuerto Rican Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island. The US Census Bureau's 2015 update provides the following facts: 94.1% of adults speak Spanish, 5.8% speak only English,\n78.3% do not speak English \"very well\".\n\nPublic school instruction in Puerto Rico is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English. English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant, Puerto Rican Sign Language.\n\nThe Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. While the Spanish spoken in all Iberian, Mediterranean and Atlantic Spanish Maritime Provinces was brought to the island over the centuries, the most profound regional influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has been from that spoken in the present-day Canary Islands. The Spanish of Puerto Rico also includes occasional Taíno words, typically in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music or dances.\n\nThere are many religious beliefs represented in the island. Religious breakdown in Puerto Rico (as of 2006) is given in the table on the right.\n\nThe majority of Puerto Ricans in the Island are Christians. Spiritists have a large secondary following. Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Buddhists all have a small presence as well. Roman Catholicism has been the main Christian sect among Puerto Ricans since the arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century, but the presence of Protestant, Mormon, Pentecostal, and Jehovah's Witnesses denominations has increased under U.S. sovereignty, making modern Puerto Rico an inter-denominational, multi-religious community. The Afro-Caribbean religion Santería is also practiced.\n\nIn 1998, a news report stated that \"Puerto Rico [was] no longer predominantly Catholic\". Pollster Pablo Ramos wrote that the population was 38% Roman Catholic, 28% Pentecostal, and 18% were members of independent churches. However, an Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent of [Puerto Ricans] identify themselves as Catholic\". The CIA World Factbook reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other.\n\nPuerto Ricans often proudly identify themselves as \"Boricua\" (formerly also spelled \"Boriquén\", \"Borinquén\", or \"Borinqueño\"), derived from the Taíno word \"Boriken\", to illustrate their recognition of the island's Taíno heritage. The word \"Boriken\" translates to \"the great land of the valiant and noble Lord\". Borikén was used by the original Taíno population to refer to the island of Puerto Rico before the arrival of the Spanish. The use of the word \"Boricua\" has been popularized in the island and abroad by descendants of Puerto Rico heritage, commonly using the phrase \"yo soy Boricua\" (\"I am Boricua\") to identify themselves as Puerto Ricans. Other variations which are also widely used are \"Borinqueño\" and \"Borincano\", meaning \"from Borinquen\". The first recorded use of the word Boricua comes from Christopher Columbus in his Letter to the Sovereigns of 4 March 1493.\n\nThe federal Naturalization Act, signed into law on March 26, 1790 by George Washington, explicitly barred anyone not of the White \"race\" from applying for U.S. citizenship. This law remained in effect until the 1950s, although its enforcement was tightened in the late nineteenth century regarding Asian immigrants, and by the Johnson-Reed act of 1924 imposing immigration quotas. In short, until late in the twentieth century, only immigrants of the White \"race\" could hope to become naturalized citizens. The people of Puerto Rico were declared U.S. citizens in 1917.\n\nPuerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of the passage of the Jones-Shafroth Act of 1917. Since this law was the result of Congressional legislation, and not the result of an amendment to the United States Constitution, the current U.S. citizenship of Puerto Ricans can be revoked by Congress, as they are \"statutory citizens\", not \"14th Amendment citizens\". The Jones Act established that Puerto Ricans born prior to 1899 were considered naturalized citizens of Puerto Rico, and anyone born after 1898 were U.S. citizens, unless the Puerto Rican expressed his/her intentions to remain a Spanish subject. Since 1948, it was decided by Congress that all Puerto Ricans, whether born within the United States or in Puerto Rico, were naturally born United States citizens.\n\nPuerto Ricans and other U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in presidential elections as that is a right reserved by the U.S. Constitution to admitted states and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College system. Nevertheless, both the Democratic Party and Republican Party, while not fielding candidates for public office in Puerto Rico, provide the islands with state-sized voting delegations at their presidential nominating conventions. Delegate selection processes frequently have resulted in presidential primaries being held in Puerto Rico. U.S. Citizens residing in Puerto Rico do not elect U.S. Representatives or Senators, however, Puerto Rico is represented in the House of Representatives by an elected representative commonly known as the Resident Commissioner, who has the same duties and obligations as a representative, with the exception of being able to cast votes on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The Resident Commissioner is elected by Puerto Ricans to a four-year term and does serve on congressional committee. Puerto Ricans residing in the U.S. states have all rights and privileges of other U.S. citizens living in the states.\n\nAs statutory U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico may enlist in the U.S. military and have been included in the compulsory draft when it has been in effect. Puerto Ricans have fully participated in all U.S. wars and military conflicts since 1898, such as World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq war.\n\nSince 2007, the Puerto Rico State Department has developed a protocol to issue certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans. In order to be eligible, applicants must have been born in Puerto Rico; born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican-born parent; or be an American citizen with at least one year residence in Puerto Rico. The citizenship is internationally recognized by Spain, which considers Puerto Rico to be an Ibero-American nation. Therefore, Puerto Rican citizens have the ability to apply for Spanish citizenship after only two years residency in Spain (instead of the standard 10 years).\n\nSince 1953, the UN has been considering the political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving \"independence\" or \"decolonization\". In 1978, the Special Committee determined that a \"colonial relationship\" existed between the US and Puerto Rico.\n\nNote that the UN's Special Committee has often referred to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity.<ref name=\"United Nations. General Assembly. Special Committee on the Situation With Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples 1971 https://books.google.com/books?id=4nEyLDpKZjMC&pg=PA10 10–11\"></ref> Most recently, in a June 2016 report, the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico. More specifically, the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence. ... allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty\".\n\nPuerto Rico has held four referendums to determine whether to retain its status as a territory or to switch to some other status such as statehood. The fourth, the Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012 occurred on November 6, 2012. The result a 54% majority of the ballots cast against the continuation of the island's territorial political status, and in favor of a new status. Of votes for new status, a 61.1% majority chose statehood. This was by far the most successful referendum for statehood advocates. In all earlier referenda, votes for statehood were matched almost equally by votes for remaining an American territory, with the remainder for independence. Support for U.S. statehood has risen in each successive popular referendum.\n\nThe fifth, the Puerto Rican status referendum, 2017, was held on June 11, 2017 and offered three options: \"Statehood,\" \"Independence/Free Association,\" and \"Current Territorial Status.\" With 23% of register voters casting ballots, 97% voted for statehood. Benefits of statehood would include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds, the right to vote in presidential elections, higher Social Security and Medicare benefits, and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy. The latter is currently prohibited.\n\nEven with the Puerto Ricans' vote for statehood, action by the United States Congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\n"}

In 2012, \"Forbes\" magazine listed him as the 60th-wealthiest person in the United States, and the 205th-richest in the world, with an estimated net worth of $5.1 billion.\n\nDeVos was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the son of Ethel Ruth (Dekker) and Simon Cornelius DeVos, who worked in the electrical business. He was educated at Calvin College and was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity. He served in the military in World War II in the United States Army Air Corps.\n\nBooks written by him include \"Compassionate Capitalism\" and \"Hope From My Heart: Ten Lessons For Life\". The latter reflects his feelings after successfully undergoing a heart transplant operation in 1997. This was preceded by two heart-bypass operations in 1983 and 1992. In 1975, DeVos published a book about his success, co-authored with Charles Paul Conn, titled \"Believe!\". In 2014 he published his memoirs titled \"Simply Rich\".\n\nDeVos was the owner of the NBA team Orlando Magic, having bought the team in 1991 for $85 million. He became interested in the team after an unsuccessful effort to acquire a Major League Baseball expansion franchise for Orlando.\n\nDeVos also formerly owned the Orlando Solar Bears, Grand Rapids Griffins, and the Kansas City Blades, three International Hockey League franchises before that league folded; the Solar Bears and Blades were closed as a result of the league folding, while the Griffins moved to the American Hockey League, and are now under the ownership of Dan DeVos, one of Richard's sons.\n\nDeVos asked Orange County, Florida, to help pay for the Orlando Magic's new arena using county funds and Dema Stobell's Corporation money. Amway pays for the naming rights to Amway Center. The use of public money was controversial.\n\nHe sat on the board of trustees of Northwood University and has been president of the Council for National Policy. He also served on the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, which is a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution. He sat on the legacy board of Christian Leaders Institute, the nonprofit organization founded by Henry Reyenga Jr. after he was encouraged by DeVos and Ron Parr.\n\nHe co-founded the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation, an American conservative foundation and grant-making body in 1970. It is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The DeVoses were known in their philanthropy for contributing to education, health care, arts and historic causes like Mount Vernon, and free-market think tanks such as The Heritage Foundation and AEI.\n\nAccording to the DeVoses, the core of their giving is local. \"A focus of our philanthropy has always been our home area. We want to create an atmosphere for everyone to improve their circumstances while advancing our community, whether through Christian compassion, education, health care, or the arts.\" The DeVoses gave money to organizations ranging from local schools to the regional symphony. According to the Philanthropy Roundtable, their giving is \"helping turn Grand Rapids, Michigan, into one of the livelier and healthier small cities in the U.S. When the couple won their Simon Prize in 2006, they distributed the award money to eight local organizations in western Michigan 'whose leaders all demonstrated resourcefulness in helping people help themselves'\".\n\nWith his wife, Helen June (Van Wesep), DeVos was a winner of the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.\n\nEducation-related philanthropy included the Richard M. and Helen DeVos Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation at Grand Valley State University, the Richard and Helen DeVos Fieldhouse at Hope College and the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Arts and Worship at Grand Rapids Christian Schools. The Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation was in part responsible for funding the creation of the Sport Business Management Program at the University of Central Florida.\n\nDeVos was a major donor to the U.S. Republican Party and to conservative causes, including Focus on the Family, the American Enterprise Institute. DeVos supported the candidacies of Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich.

Two other teens, Jimmy Troiano and Albert Quinones, were present at the murder, which took place in the Aztakea Woods of Northport while all four were high on what they believed to be mescaline, but was most likely LSD.\n\nThe murder became sensational news in New York City and across the nation due to the alleged torture of Lauwers and supposed occult aspects of the murder. The murder took place during a period when there was much public concern over the effects of Satanic and occult content in heavy metal music and in role-playing games. Kasso was wearing an AC/DC T-shirt at the time of his arrest and was a fan of groups such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nKasso was the son of a local high school history teacher and football coach at affluent Cold Spring Harbor High School. Kasso was often thrown out of his home as a young teen and lived on the streets of suburban Northport, New York, usually sleeping in the local woods, or in the cars, garages, backyards and houses of friends. He often took drugs, mainly marijuana, hashish, LSD, PCP, and purple-microdots of what he believed to be mescaline, but was most likely low-grade LSD. He tended to consume all of his drugs, but had on occasion dealt drugs in Northport as well. \n\nKasso dabbled in the occult and Satanism and was acquainted with the members of a loosely organized group of friends who sold marijuana and referred to themselves as the \"Knights of the Black Circle\". After Kasso's murder of Lauwers, several newspapers and television journalists incorrectly reported the Knights as being a \"Satanic cult.\" Kasso allegedly participated in occult ceremonies, mostly in Northport, and celebrated Walpurgisnacht at the infamous Amityville Horror house in 1984. Kasso also expressed to friends his interest in Anton LaVey's book \"The Satanic Bible\". On at least one occasion, Ricky's parents admitted him to the South Oaks Psychiatric Hospital (formerly known as the Amityville Asylum) in Amityville, New York for drug rehabilitation and psychiatric care.\n\nIn the year prior to the murder, Kasso had been arrested for digging into a colonial-era grave inside a local cemetery. Less than a month after his arrest for this crime, Ricky contracted pneumonia and was treated at Long Island Jewish Hospital. During his hospital stay, his parents tried to convince the doctors to commit him for involuntary psychiatric care. However, the conclusion of the psychiatrists was that Kasso exhibited antisocial behavior but was neither psychotic nor a violent danger, and Kasso was released upon recovering from his bout with pneumonia.\n\nThe conflict between Kasso and Lauwers had started some time earlier when Lauwers stole 10 bags of PCP from Kasso's jacket, after he had passed out at a party. Kasso confronted him soon after the incident, prompting Lauwers to immediately return five of the ten bags of PCP. Lauwers also promised to repay Kasso $50 for the five bags of PCP that had been used. Kasso reportedly beat Lauwers on four separate occasions. On the night of the murder, Kasso visited the small gazebo in the new Cow Harbor park and borrowed a radio from a friend. He then invited Lauwers to get high with him, Troiano and Quinones. The group walked to Aztakea Woods, set up camp and ingested several doses, or \"hits\", of what they believed to be mescaline. The drugs they ingested were tablets called \"purple microdots\", and while they were erroneously referred to as mescaline on the street, they were actually most likely LSD. The teens also smoked several bags of PCP before attempting to start a small fire, but all of the available firewood was too wet and would not ignite. Lauwers used his socks, as well as the sleeves from his denim jacket, as kindling to start the fire.\n\nAt some point during the night, the situation escalated into violence. Kasso scuffled with Lauwers, bit him on the neck and stabbed him in the chest. Kasso continued his assault on Lauwers, and Quinones later claimed that Troiano helped Kasso and held Lauwers during the attack. During subsequent testimony he provided under immunity, Quinones later claimed that Troiano did not assist Kasso. Lauwers was stabbed somewhere between 17 and 36 times and his eyeballs were possibly sliced out during the stabbing. During the attack, Kasso allegedly commanded Lauwers to \"Say you love Satan\", and Lauwers is said to have instead replied \"I love my mother,\" before finally giving in to Kasso's demands. After the attack, Kasso and Troiano covered Lauwers' body with leaves and small branches and left it in the woods.\n\nThe date of the murder was initially misreported by the police and press as June 16, 1984. In 2018, it was revealed that the murder had actually taken place three days later on June 19.\n\nIn the aftermath, Kasso bragged about the murder to friends. Kasso claimed Satan manifested in the form of a black crow after killing Lauwers, and that the crow had cawed; something he interpreted as Satan's approval of the murder. Kasso even brought several disbelieving teens to view Lauwers' body before he and Troiano returned to the woods to bury the decomposing remains in a shallow grave. However, it wasn't until two weeks went by, on July 1, that the murder was reported to the police via an anonymous tip. On July 4, 1984, police used dogs to search Aztakea Woods and recovered the decomposing and mutilated body of Gary Lauwers. Kasso and Troiano were arrested the next day. On July 7, Kasso committed suicide by hanging himself in his jail cell.\n\nJimmy Troiano signed two confessions that he later recanted. Quinones gave witness account that Troiano helped Kasso during the murder, but later denied this during his testimony at Troiano's trial. Due to Quinones' drugged state at the time of the killing, his testimony was brought into question and Troiano was acquitted of second-degree murder in a trial by jury in April 1985.\n\nBooks\n\nDocumentaries\n\nFilms\n\nAlbums and songs\n\n\nIn \"Rolling Stone\" magazine:\n\nIn \"Newsday\" (Long Island, New York):\n\nIn the \"Toronto Sun\":\n\nIn the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" (Pennsylvania):\n\nChronology of the trial in the \"New York Times\" (available online)\n\n"}
{"id": "1098346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1098346", "title": "Sanakht", "text": "Sanakht\n\nSanakht (also read as Hor-Sanakht) was an ancient Egyptian king (pharaoh) of the Third Dynasty during the Old Kingdom. His chronological position is highly uncertain, and it is also unclear under which Hellenized name the ancient historian Manetho could have listed him. Many Egyptologists connect Sanakht with the Ramesside cartouche name \"Nebka\". However, this remains disputable, because no further royal title of that king was ever found; neither in contemporary sources, nor in later ones. There are two relief fragments depicting Sanakht that once originated from the Wadi Maghareh on the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nSanakht's identity and position in the third Dynasty is not entirely clear and remains the subject of debates. While Sanakht's existence is attested by seal fragments from mastaba K2 at Beit Khallaf and a graffito, his position as the founder of the Third Dynasty, as recorded by Manetho and the Turin Canon, has been seriously undermined by recent archaeological discoveries at Abydos. These discoveries establish that it was likely Djoser who helped bury—and thus succeed—Khasekhemwy, rather than Sanakht. This is determined from seals found at the entrance to the latter's tomb bearing Djoser's name.\n\nProponents of the theory that Sanakht was nonetheless the founder of the dynasty object that the presence of Djoser's seals in Khasekhemwy's tomb only shows that Djoser conducted cultural rituals in honor of this king, and does not necessarily imply that Djoser was Khasekhemwy's immediate successor. Sanakht could then have married Queen Nimaethap, with Nimaethap being the daughter of Khasekhemwy rather than his wife. Together with Sanakht, they could be the parents of Djoser. Alternatively, some have considered Sanakht to be Djoser's elder brother.\n\nPresently, the dominant theory is that Sanakht's reign dates to the later Third Dynasty, after Djoser. Egyptologists Toby Wilkinson, Stephan Seidlmayer, Kenneth Kitchen and Rainer Stadelmann equate Sanakht with \"Nebka\", a name appearing in Ramesside king lists. In support of this theory is a clay seal fragment on which the lower part of a cartouche appears. In this cartouche Wilkinson, Seidlmayer and Stadelmann see traces of a \"Ka\"-sign, the end of the name \"Nebka\". Likewise, Dietrich Wildung favors equating Nebka with Sanakht, although he questions the validity of the seal as evidence given that it is too badly damaged to read the inscription within the cartouche \"Nebka\" with any certainty.\n\nJohn D. Degreef, Nabil Swelim and Wolfgang Helck are against equating Nebka with Sanakht. They refer to the fact that the name \"Nebka\" is not attested on any monument nor in any document dating to before Djoser. Instead, Nabil Swelim identifies Nebka with the Horus name Khaba. He further identifies Sanakht with a king \"Mesochris\" mentioned by Manetho, regarding this as a Hellenized form of the throne name of Sanakht. He dated Sanakht's reign to between the seventh and eighth king of the 3rd dynasty.\n\nJürgen von Beckerath, Wolfgang Helck, Dietrich Wildung and Peter Kaplony proposed that Sanakht's horus name is that of the shadowy \"Horus Sa\", seeing the name \"Sa\" as a short form of \"Sanakht\". From this Wolfgang Helck holds that Sanakht's Nisut-Biti name was Weneg. King Weneg however, is widely hold to have ruled during the 2nd Dynasty and Helck's theory has been greeted with skepticism.\n\nSanakht's name was once read \"Hen Nekht\" by Egyptologists such as Ernest Wallis Budge. Today, this reading is not in use anymore; the up-to-date reading is \"Sanakht\" or (seldomly) \"Nakht-Sa\".\n\nThe exact duration of Sanakht's time on the throne is unknown. Unlike Djoser, few relics survive from his reign, which casts serious doubts on the traditional figure of 18 years of reign for this king, as given by both Manetho and the Turin Canon. It must be stressed that the Turin Canon and Manetho were more than one and two thousand years removed from the time of Egypt's third dynasty, and would be expected to contain some inaccurate or unreliable data. The Turin Canon, for instance, was transcribed on papyri that dates to the reign of the New Kingdom king, Ramesses II, who ruled Egypt from 1279-1213 BC.\n\nVery little is known of Sanakht's activities during his reign. The presence of reliefs depicting him in the Sinai at Wadi Maghareh together with those of Djoser and Sekhemkhet suggest an important Egyptian presence there at the time of the Third Dynasty. Expeditions were launched for the procurement of mineral resources, in particular turquoise.\n\nThe location of Sanakht's tomb is not known with certainty. It was long thought that Sanakht's tomb was the large mastaba K2 at Beit Khallaf as excavations there yielded relief fragments bearing his name. However, some Egyptologists now regard this mastaba as the burial of a high official, prince or queen rather than that of a pharaoh, while others continue to support the first hypothesis.\n\nIn the mastaba were found the skeletal remains of a man over tall. According to Charles S. Myers, this stature was considerably higher than the average of later and prehistoric Egyptians. The specimen's skull was very large and capacious. Although his cranial index was unusually broad and almost brachycephalic, the proportions of his long bones were tropically adapted like those of most other ancient Egyptians; especially those from the predynastic period. His overall cranial features, however, were closer to those of dynastic period Egyptian skulls.\n\nConsequently, the mastaba has been associated with an anecdote related by Manetho who tells of a late 2nd dynasty king, called \"Sesochris\", which he describes as being particularly tall. The egyptologist Wolfgang Helck proposed another hypothesis; namely, that Sanakht's tomb is an unfinished structure west of the pyramid of Djoser.\n\nWhile the case of Sanakht would often resurface in the medical literature as a potential case of pituitary disease, no definitive consensus has existed for many years on whether it was acromegaly or gigantism. In 2017 palaeopathologist Francesco M. Galassi and Egyptologist Michael E. Habicht from Zurich University's Institute of Evolutionary Medicine coordinated an international team of researchers to reassess this case. Their conclusion was that the alleged remains of Sanakht are clearly the oldest case of gigantism in the world.\n\n\n"}

Most Aquitainian counts elected Pepin II as their king, but Emperor Louis the Pious, urged by his wife Judith, redivided his vast realm at Worms in May 839, granting all of Aquitaine, Gascony, Septimania, and the Hispanic March to his youngest son, Charles the Bald. Louis sent an imperial army into the Limousin and then installed his son at Poitiers. The partisans of Pepin were defeated and Louis proceeded to appoint new counts in new districts. One Seguin was appointed in Bordeaux to counter Sancho, now acting virtually alone.\n\nSeguin was appointed \"dux Wasconum\" by Louis the Pious—that is, duke of the march guarding the frontier with the Gascons, led by Sancho, most probably a Basque himself. Seguin was killed later that year in a battle against the Vikings. In 848, Bordeaux was left without a leader after the withdrawal of the Vikings. It is not known for sure if Sancho took possession of the city, but it is certainly possible. Historian Ferdinand Lot supposed that Sancho was even nominated as duke at Limoges or Orléans by Charles the Bald in that year. He certainly submitted by 850. With his brother-in-law Emenon, Count of Périgord, the husband of his sister Sancha, Sancho was captured by the dissident Moorish chieftain Musa. Charles negotiated their release and in turn Sancho handed over Pepin II when the latter took refuge in Gascony in September 852.\n\nIn or before 864, Sancho died and the duchy of Gascony passed to his nephew Arnold, son of Emenon. The later duke García Sánchez may have been his son.\n\n\n"}

There, he made possible the publication of the magazine \"Vedem\" (\"we lead\") that consisted of poems, stories and drawings from young images, age twelve to fifteen. He was murdered by the Nazi regime on one of the death marches.\n\nValtr Eisinger was the son of Adolf Eisinger (1878-1944) and Julie née Eisinger (1879-1944). He had five siblings, sisters Therese (born 1903) and Martha (1905), brothers Sigmund (1902), Bruno (born on 24 November 1907) and Viktor (1908). He became a teacher and married Věra née Sommerová (born on 30 March 1922).\n\nHis last residence before deportation was in Brno. On 28 January 1942 he was deported with Transport U from Brno to Theresienstadt. His transport number was 930 of 1,001. In Theresienstadt, he was appointed to supervise the boys in one of the foster homes in L 417. He was also active in the Communist resistance group in Theresienstadt and collaborated with Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, Margita and Miroslav Kárný, Josef Stiassny, Josef Taussig and Bruno Zwicker. In his work with the youth he furthered the concept of \"self-administration\", procured secret teaching and was supported by his close friend Bruno Zwicker (1907-1944), a former representative of the Brno School of Sociology. Tomas Brod, born 1929, later-on reported: \"The Jewish administration did not have enough money to improve the situation for all prisoners, and so it took most care of the children and young people, since in them it saw hope for the future. This is why we, in the children's houses, lived in somewhat better conditions.\"\n\n\"Vedem\" also contains over 40 contributions from Eisinger himself. He wrote about culture, politics and pedagogical themes, but he also translated poetry, especially Russian. Several survivors of the Shoah praised Eisinger's educational activities in Theresienstadt and his contribution to the secret teaching of the youth in the ghetto. \n\nOn 28 September 1944 he was deported with Transport Ek to Auschwitz concentration camp. His transport number was 422 of 2,500.\nFrom there he was deported to a working command post in Buchenwald concentration camp.
