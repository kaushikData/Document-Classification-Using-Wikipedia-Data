Convicted February 16, 1999 - Murder in the second degree, possession of narcotics. Sentence: 50 years, up for parole in 20.\"\n\nRaised with his brother Hank by his racist grandfather Heinrick and equally racist father Vern Schillinger, Andrew has supported the ideology of the Aryan Brotherhood throughout his whole life. As a result, he lands in Oz for his part in a hate crime — he and a few friends murder a black man by dragging him from the back of a pickup truck (very similar to the James Byrd murder in Jasper, Texas).\n\nAndrew, however, has a problem that makes his commitment to the brotherhood questionable: he is a full-blown heroin addict. Andrew's addiction causes problems between him and his father in Oz that eventually result in his death.\n\nWhen he and Hank were 12 and 10 years old (respectively), Vern nearly murdered a black drug dealer from whom they were trying to buy marijuana, the crime for which he was incarcerated.\n\nAndrew arrives in Oz for his part in a hate crime (murdering a black man). When in Oz, he looks for drugs immediately and is supplied by Irish inmate Ryan O'Reily. He has been moved to Emerald City purposefully by unit manager Tim McManus, who hates his father Vernon Schillinger, the head of the Aryan Brotherhood, serving time in Oz's unit B. When Schillinger begs Warden Glynn to move Andrew to Unit B, Glynn refuses in order to punish him. \n\nIn the cafeteria, Vern sees Andrew drugged out courtesy of O'Reilly and then gets guard Len Lopresti to take him to the isolation ward for using heroin. Because of Andrew's addiction, Vern tells the brotherhood to ignore him until he is drug free, as the Aryans in Oz oppose the use of drugs. At the same time, the other inmates, including the blacks, who are sickened by his crime, do not make any attempts to kill or rape Andrew out of fear of Vern's wrath. When Andrew gets back to Emerald City, he is cut off from O'Reilly's drug connections, who claims that Andrew is burning through his supply too fast. O'Reilly then points out that the other dealers in Oz are of other races, who Andrew refuses to buy from.\n\nIn drug rehab, Andrew is very disrespectful to Sister Pete and his attitude starts a fight between inmates Chris Keller and Tobias Beecher, which they later reveal was staged. Beecher then befriends Andrew, a move that McManus, the staff, and other inmates question, given Beecher's longstanding feud with Vern. Over a period of time, Beecher helps Andrew beat his addiction, and Andrew befriends O'Reily and Keller as well. As all three are looking to exact revenge on Vern, Schillinger becomes worried that his son will be murdered or raped by any of the three, especially after Beecher taunts Schillinger in the mail room. Meanwhile, as Andrew gets clean, he starts to question the ideology taught to him by his family.\n\nIn the cafeteria, Vern speaks with Andrew and hugs him, happy that he is drug free. He claims that he wants have a better relationship with him, but Andrew rejects him, angered by everything that his father stands for. Vern hits him and Andrew retaliates, until the guards, led by Lopresti, take Andrew to the hole. Vern, heartbroken that his son has renounced him, arranges for the guards to take Andrew a package of heroin, as a way of \"renouncing\" him. Lopresti delivers the heroin to the hole. Andrew at first resists, throwing the package away, but breaks down and then overdoses on it. As the guards carry Andrew's personal effects out of his cell, Beecher, O'Reilly, and Keller reveal that this was their plan all along.\n\nHis spirit, along with Hank's, narrate the episode \"4giveness\".\n\n"}

Lal, is an Indian archaeologist. He was the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) from 1968 to 1972 and has served as Director of the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla. Lal also served on various UNESCO committees.\n\nHe received the Padma Bhushan Award by the Government of India in 2000.\n\nBorn in Jhansi, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, India, Lal obtained his master's degree in Sanskrit, including the Vedas, with a First class degree from Allahabad University, India.\n\nAfter his studies, Lal developed interest in archaeology and in 1943, became a trainee in excavation under a veteran British archaeologist, Mortimer Wheeler, starting with Taxila, and later at sites such as Harappa and Sisupalgarh in Odisha. Lal went on to work as an archaeologist for more than fifty years.\n\nIn 1968, he was appointed the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India where he would remain until 1972. Thereafter, Lal served as Director of the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla.\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of India had performed conservation and restoration of Buddhas of Bamiyan, Khwaj Parsa’s Mosque at Balkh and the shrine of Khwaja Abu Naser under R. Sen Gupta and Lal in Afghanistan.\n\nBetween 1950-52, Lal worked on the archaeology of sites accounted for in the Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\", including Hastinapura, the capital city of the Kurus. He made discoveries of many Painted Grey Ware (PGW) sites in the Indo‑Gangetic Divide and upper Yamuna‑Ganga doab.\n\nIn Nubia, the Archaeological Survey of India, Lal and his team discovered Middle and Late Stone Age tools in the terraces of the river Nile near Afyeh. The team excavated a few sites at Afyeh and cemetery of C-group people, where 109 graves would be located. Lal worked on Mesolithic site of Birbhanpur (West Bengal), Chalcolithic site of Gilund (Rajasthan) and Harappan site of Kalibangan (Rajasthan).\n\nIn 1975-76, Lal worked on the \"Archaeology of Ramayana Sites\" project funded by the ASI, which excavated five sites mentioned in the Hindu epic \"Ramayana\" - Ayodhya, Bharadwaj \"ashram\", Nandigram, Chitrakoot and Shringaverapur. In the seven-page preliminary report submitted to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Lal disclosed the discovery by his team of \"pillar bases\", immediately south of the Babri mosque structure in Ayodhya.\n\nProf. B. B. Lal has published several books and over 150 research papers and articles in national and international scientific journals. In his 2002 book, \"The Saraswati Flows On\", Lal criticised the earlier Aryan invasion/migration theory, arguing that the Rig Vedic description of the Sarasvati River (which dried up by 2000 BCE) as \"overflowing\" contradicts the claim made by certain previous historians that the Indo-Aryan migration occurred 300 years after they contend the Sarasvati River dried up (in 1500 BCE) and which they also contended had led to the end of the Indus Valley Civilization.\n\nIn Lal's 2008 book, \"Rāma, His Historicity, Mandir and Setu: Evidence of Literature, Archaeology and Other Sciences\", he writes (that): \n\n\"Attached to the piers of the Babri Masjid, there were twelve stone pillars, which carried not only typical Hindu motifs and mouldings, but also figures of Hindu deities. It was self-evident that these pillars were not an integral part of the Masjid, but were foreign to it.\"\nThe B. B. Lal Chair at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT, Kanpur) has been established in his honour.\n\nThe British archaeologists Stuart Piggott and D.H. Gordon describe \"Copper Hoards of the Gangetic Basin\" and the \"Hastinapura Excavation Report\", two of Lal's works published in the \"Journal of the Archaeological Survey of India\", as \"models of research and excavation reporting\".\n\n\nLal continues to live in Delhi.

He founded Project PM, a research collaboration and wiki, to facilitate analysis of the troves of hacked emails and other leaked information concerning the inner workings of the cyber-military-industrial complex.\n\nIn January 2015, Brown was sentenced to 63 months in federal prison for the crimes of accessory after the fact, obstruction of justice, and threatening a federal officer stemming from the FBI's investigation into the 2012 Stratfor email leak. Prosecutors had previously brought other charges associated with his sharing of an HTTP link to the leaked Stratfor data, but those charges were dropped in 2014. As part of his sentence, Brown was also required to pay almost $900,000 to Stratfor.\n\nPrior to 2011, Brown had ties with the hacktivist collective Anonymous.\n\nBrown was born in Dallas, Texas, to Robert Brown and Karen Lancaster, who later divorced. He grew up in Dallas and exhibited an early interest in writing and journalism, creating his own newspapers on his family's computer while attending Preston Hollow Elementary School. He went on to contribute to his school newspapers, and interned at several weekly newspapers during his teenage years. He attended the Episcopal School of Dallas through his sophomore year of high school, then spent his would-be junior year in Tanzania with his father who was residing there on business. While in Africa, Brown completed high school online through a Texas Tech University program, earning college credits as well as his high school diploma. In 2000 he enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin and spent two semesters taking writing courses before leaving school to pursue a full-time career as a freelance writer.\n\nBrown served as the director of communications for \"Enlighten the Vote\", an atheist PAC that provides financial and strategic assistance to political candidates that advocate strict enforcement of the Establishment Clause.\n\nIn 2010, Brown began work on his crowdsourced investigation wiki, Project PM. Brown has written that the main goals of Project PM are to increase the positive influence of what he calls \"the more capable segments of the blogosphere\", while reducing the negative influence of well-regarded mainstream pundits, who may have political agendas not compatible with public interest. It was his aim that the wiki Project PM be established by way of the deliberate generation of critical mass of work and following among dependable bloggers in such a manner as that segments of the traditional media will be prompted or even forced to address critical issues in their own methods and means of reportage. A further and experimental aim of Project PM is also to develop a communicational schematic which could provide bloggers, reporters and any other concerned Citizen journalist with the best possible feed of raw information by which to produce content.\n\nOn the aim of Project PM, Brown has stated: \nThe institutions and structures that have developed over the past two decades of accelerating public internet use have had what we reasonably describe as a wholesome effect on information flow. But the information age is a work in progress, and thus there are potential improvements to be made. More importantly, there are improvements that can be made by an initially small number of influential participants working in coordination. The purpose of Project PM is to implement these solutions to the extent that participants are collectively able to do so, as well as to demonstrate the beneficial effects of these solutions to others that they might be spurred to recreate or even build upon them independently of our own efforts.\n\nIn June 2011, he and Project PM released an exclusive report about a surveillance contract called \"Romas/COIN\" which was discovered in e-mails hacked from HBGary by Anonymous. It consisted of sophisticated data-mining techniques leveraging mobile software and aimed at Arab countries.\n\nIn November 2011, Brown said that 75 names of members of the Zetas drug cartel would be released if a member of the Anonymous group who had been kidnapped was not set free. Brown says the member was then released and that there was a truce between him and the drug cartel for the moment. Others have said the kidnapping was fake.\n\nOn January 18, 2012, Brown was interviewed by the English language Russian news network RT about the cyber attacks by Anonymous and the temporary blackout of the US government websites WhiteHouse.Gov, DoJ.gov and FBI.gov.\n\nOn March 6, 2012, he confirmed on Twitter that the FBI raided his residence after receiving information from Hector Xavier Monsegur (also known by the online pseudonym Sabu), the founder of LulzSec.\n\nIn early January 2014, it was announced that his second book, begun in 2006, will be published. According to his legal defense website\nThe book was originally titled \"Hot, Fat, and Clouded: The Amazing and Amusing Failures of America’s Chattering Class\" and consisted of his attack on the ubiquitous newspaper columnists and media pundits whom he argues are undeservedly influential and able to form public opinion. … We are excited to announce that we have rescued the book from its fate and that it will soon see the light of day. Newly titled as \"Keep Rootin’ for Putin: Establishment Pundits and the Twilight of American Competence\", the text become available as an eBook in the spring of 2014 for donors to his legal defense fund.\n\nFrom September 2012, during his incarceration, Brown wrote a series of columns for D Magazine titled \"The Barrett Brown Review of Arts and Letters and Jail\". In 2015 he transitioned from D to The Intercept. In 2016 The Intercept won a National Magazine Award for three of Barrett's columns.\n\nHe has written for \"The Daily Beast\",\"Vanity Fair\", \"True/Slant\", \"The Huffington Post\", \"The Guardian\", and other publications.\n\nSome media outlets have presented Brown as a spokesperson for Anonymous, a label he disputes. He has appeared in the documentaries \"We Are Legion\", \"Terms and Conditions May Apply\", and \"The Hacker Wars\".\nBrown has said he renounced his links with the group in 2011. It was also reported in 2011 that Brown and Anon alumnus Gregg Housh had landed a six-figure deal with Amazon for a book tentatively titled \"Anonymous: Tales From Inside The Accidental Cyberwar\".\n\nOn March 6, 2012, the FBI executed search warrants at Brown's apartment and his mother's house seeking evidence of alleged crimes. The items to be seized included \"Records relating to HBGary, Infragard, Endgame Systems, Anonymous, LulzSec, IRC Chats, Twitter, wiki.echelon2.org, and pastebin.com.\" Agents took possession of his laptop computers. \"I suspect that the FBI is working off of incorrect information,\" Brown told a reporter.\n\nOn September 12, 2012, Brown was arrested in Dallas County, Texas for threatening an FBI agent in a YouTube video. His arrest occurred as he left a computer linked to Tinychat in which the raid could be heard in the background. Brown has talked publicly about his history of using heroin and he was going through withdrawal on the day of his arrest.\n\nA magistrate denied bail, and therefore he was kept in pre-trial detention, because he was \"a danger to the safety of the community and a risk of flight.\"\n\nOn September 24, 2012, a Pastebin post appeared titled \"Barrett Brown – Communiqué from Prison 9/20/12\", in which Brown thanked supporters, described the insufficient medical treatment he received after having his ribs injured during his arrest, and acknowledged some past mistakes. The missive concludes, \"I will personally thank everyone on the outside who has helped me and this movement particularly at this critical time, when I have regained the freedom that I did nothing to lose. For now, and until that time, it is war, on paper as always, but war.\"\n\nOn October 3, 2012, a federal grand jury indictment was returned against Brown on charges of threats, conspiracy and retaliation against a federal law enforcement officer. Various tweets, YouTube uploads and comments made by Brown before his arrest were cited as support within the indictment. He later entered a plea of not guilty to all three counts.\n\nOn December 4, 2012, Brown was indicted on an additional 12 federal charges related to the December 25, 2011 hack of Austin-based private intelligence company Stratfor carried out by Jeremy Hammond. A trove of millions of Stratfor emails from the hack, including authentication information for thousands of credit card accounts, was shared by the hacker collective LulzSec with whistleblower site WikiLeaks (main article: 2012 Stratfor email leak). While Hammond pleaded guilty and received the maximum sentence of ten years in federal prison for the hack itself, Brown faced up to 45 years in federal prison for allegedly sharing a link to the data as part of Project PM, after a presumed FBI entrapment maneuver. Attorney Jesselyn Radack has raised connections between Brown's case, and that of her client Peter Van Buren, whom the State Department sought to prosecute over a link on his personal blog to a Wikileaks document. Two online commentators on internet security issues criticized the charges against Brown. He entered a plea of not guilty to all twelve counts.\n\nOn January 23, 2013, a third indictment was filed against Brown on two counts of obstruction for concealing evidence during the March 6, 2012 FBI raid of his and his mother's homes. During a brief court hearing a week later, a judge found him mentally competent to stand trial, while Brown again pleaded not guilty to the additional charges.\n\nOn May 1, 2013, it was announced that Brown had retained two attorneys, Charles Swift and Ahmed Ghappour, to represent him in his legal cases.\n\nAs of September 4, 2013, Brown was under a federal court-issued gag order; he and his lawyers were not allowed to discuss his case with the media, lest it taint a jury. Assistant United States Attorney Candina S. Heath (the lead prosecutor) said that Brown tried to manipulate the media from behind bars for his benefit, that Brown's attorney \"coordinates and/or approves of his use of the media,\" and that most of the publicity about Brown has contained false information and \"gross fabrications\". Defense counsel maintained the gag order was an unfounded and unwarranted breach of Brown's First Amendment rights. Though forbidden to write or speak out about his case, Brown continued to pen articles from his prison cell on unrelated topics. The gag order was lifted on April 23, 2014, and key documents were unsealed.\n\nBrown had been in custody since September 12, 2012. His mother was sentenced on November 8, 2013, to six months of probation and a $1,000 fine for a misdemeanor charge of obstructing the execution of a search warrant. \"My better judgment was clouded by my maternal instinct,\" she stated in court. The judge said to her, \"I feel for you, as a parent. I know you did the best you could.\"\n\nIn March 2014, most charges against Brown were dropped. In April 2014, it was reported that Brown had agreed to a plea bargain.\n\nIn January 2015, Brown was sentenced to 63 months in prison. He was also ordered to pay $890,250 in fines and restitution. Journalist Janus Kopfstein said she believed the government considered Brown to be a threat and suggested that prosecutors made false allegations that were used to increase the length of his sentence. Supporting this theory, much of Brown's December sentencing hearing was spent in drawn-out arguments over the definitions of Project PM and Brown himself.\n\nBrown was released from prison on November 29, 2016, and moved into a halfway house with five drug dealers close to downtown Dallas, Texas.\n\nOn April 27, 2017, Brown was arrested and held on unknown charges for four days. After he was released, he gave an interview to \"Democracy Now!\" while under house arrest, despite pressure from the government not to speak to the media.\n\nBrown has expressed a desire to move to Iceland or Germany when possible, telling \"Truthout\" in an interview, \" I can't stay in the US because I can't get work done if I'm always subject to these little gusts of bureaucracy, which I am. It won't be for another year or so. I'm on probation for another two years. That generally goes down to one year if you don't act up. So in a year from now I'll be in a position to leave.\"\n\nIn 2017, lawyers for donors to Brown's legal fund filed suit against Assistant United States Attorney Candina Heath for filing a subpoena against WePay that resulted in divulgence of their identities. The lawyers argued that the irrelevance of donor information to the case against Brown and the provision of the information directly to Special Agent Robert Smith of the Federal Bureau of Investigation rather than to the prosecutor or judge in the trial led to donors' belief that the information was intended to surveil and harass the donors for activity protected by the U.S. constitution, and filed for destruction of the data and monetary damages. On October 2, 2017, Judge Maria Elena James denied a motion to dismiss the case introduced by the Department of Justice.\n\nIn his sentencing statement, Brown alleged that, despite the denial of a subpoena by the judge to which he was making the statement, the identities of all contributors to the echelon2.org public Wiki had been obtained \"by other means\", and that \"now the dozens of people who have given their time and expertise to what has been hailed by journalists and advocacy groups as a crucial journalistic enterprise are now at risk of being indicted under the same sort of spurious charges that I was facing not long ago, when the government exposed me to decades of prison time for copying and pasting a link to a publicly available file that other journalists were also linking to without being prosecuted.\"\n\n\"The Intercept\", which had published award-winning work by Brown, was served with a subpoena for copies of \"all contracts and/or agreements with\", \"any payments made to or for the benefit of\", and \"all correspondence to and from\" Barrett Brown. Brown wrote, \"the idea is that they are checking to see if I have money from the Intercept that I haven’t reported\"; however, he also indicated that the Department of Justice might be seeking to dissuade publishers from giving him a platform.\n\n\"Relatively Free\" is a documentary film released in 2016 by Field of Vision about Brown's drive across Texas to a halfway house after he was released from prison.\n\nBarrett Brown's case was included as a plot point in Season 2 of the U.S. TV series \"House of Cards\".\n\nBrown serves on the advisory board of the International Modern Media Institute.\n\n\n"}

He returned for the 1991 miniseries, \"Dynasty: The Reunion\". Forsythe is the only actor to appear in every episode of the series.\n\nGeorge Peppard was originally cast as Blake, but ultimately had difficulties dealing with the somewhat unsympathetic role and was replaced with Forsythe.\n\nIn the series premiere, Denver oil tycoon Blake Carrington marries his secretary Krystle Jennings. Their marriage is strained by her discomfort as she learns about Blake's ruthless side, especially in business. Blake forces himself on Krystle when she is reluctant to have sex with him. Blake struggles with his daughter Fallon's promiscuity and his son Steven's homosexuality. He catches his son in an embrace with another man, and in a fit of anger pushes them apart.

The new series premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017.\n\nExecutive producer Josh Schwartz said that, according to series creator Esther Shapiro, \"Blake Carrington was a guy who could run this amazing company, but the one place that he really struggles is running his own family.\" Showrunner Sallie Patrick described Blake as \"a white patriarch who is in a changing world\". She noted, \"I love Grant Show's warmth when he lies directly to his son's face about having returned the phone. That's just one of the skills that make Blake Carrington the multi-billion dollar magnate that he is.\" Show said, \"Blake Carrington is not just your average soap opera character. He's very complex. He's a protagonist, but a very flawed protagonist. I was intrigued by that.\"\n\nMaureen Ryan of \"Variety\" called Grant Show \"personable and charismatic\" in the role, but noted that \"a few corporate moves that are meant to make Blake seem deviously brilliant make him look anything but.\" She added, \"If you’re going to base a show around the machinations of a brilliant and ruthless mastermind, his strokes of genius should seem whipsmart and diabolically genius, not predictable or even puzzling.\"\n"}

The 1996 release of Nefilim's album \"Zoon\" saw a departure from the ethereal gothic sound of \"Elizium\" in favour of an industrial metal and death metal direction.\n\nMcCoy's most recent studio album, \"Mourning Sun\", was released in 2005. Although it was released under the name Fields of the Nephilim, McCoy has been secretive about the musicians who play on \"Mourning Sun\", with John 'Capachino' Carter the only named contributor. The album was conceived and produced in McCoy's studio.\n\nMcCoy frequently uses mystical and occult references in his lyrics. Samples of Aleister Crowley's voice were featured on \"Elizium\"; one of Fields of the Nephilim's biggest hits, \"Moonchild\", shares a name with one of Crowley's novels.\n\nIn interviews, McCoy has hinted that he sees his on-stage performances as theurgic, magickal or shamanic workings. He is also an admirer of Austin Osman Spare (the name of the Fields of the Nephilim live album \"Earth Inferno\" comes from one of Spare's works) and has thanked \"AOS\" in dedications on his albums. In another nod to chaos magic, Fields of the Nephilim's song \"Psychonaut\" shares its name with a book on the subject by Peter J. Carroll, and quotes lines from the \"Necronomicon\". McCoy's lyrics are heavily influenced by the work of H. P. Lovecraft, and mention Cthulhu in several places.\n\nMcCoy owns a graphics company, Sheerfaith, which has supplied art and design for all of his musical projects. Sheerfaith has also produced artwork for other projects, such as for the Storm Constantine book \"Hermetech\" and Andrew Collins' \"21st Century Grail\". He himself is a 3D artist, a longtime user of LightWave 3D.\n\nMcCoy appeared as the nomad in the motion picture \"Hardware\" (1990), directed by Richard Stanley, who had previously directed a number of videos for Fields of the Nephilim.\n\nMcCoy has two daughters, Scarlett and Eden, with his long-time partner Lynn. The Nephilim's 1996 album \"Zoon\" was dedicated to Scarlett. Both girls sing on \"Mourning Sun\". McCoy comes from a religious background; he grew up in England with his mother, who was deeply religious, a Jehovah's Witness. McCoy later dealt with his relation to Christianity critically in some of his songs such as \"Chord of Souls\". He has talked in interviews about his belief in paganism.\n\n\n"}

Considered one of the better pitchers in negro league history, he was also known for serious off-the-field problems. His career came to a premature end when he became a fugitive after allegedly killing a man in 1925.\n\nBrown was born in Leon County, Texas. He had a good curveball and excellent control. He was also a good fielder and had outstanding speed but was a weak hitter. Brown played with the Dallas Black Giants in 1917 and 1918. He was regarded as a \"timid nice guy\" who did not cause trouble, but during his time with the Dallas Black Giants he was involved in a highway robbery. Although Brown was reported to have become a fugitive, Rube Foster agreed to pay $20,000 for Brown's parole and he became a member of Foster's Chicago American Giants.\n\nBrown became the ace of the American Giants as they dominated negro league baseball in the early 1920s. From 1920 through 1922, he posted a 29-8 record in league games. His 11-3 record led them to a pennant win in 1921 including three victories in a playoff with the Bacharach Giants. His 8-3 record contributed to another pennant in 1922. In the winter following the 1922 season, Brown joined Oscar Charleston for the first season of the Cuban League's Santa Clara Leopardos.\n\nFor the 1923 season, Brown left Rube Foster's American Giants for the brand new Eastern Colored League. Foster voiced his displeasure, pointing out that Brown had been paroled to him and that he had promised Brown's mother to take care of him. He pointed out that the public would vilify him if he revoked. Brown posted a losing record in his first season with the New York Lincoln Giants but he and Charleston returned to Cuba the following winter and helped Santa Clara compile one of the best records in Cuban baseball history. His second season with the Lincoln Giants improved on the first and he defeated \"Cannonball\" Dick Redding and the Brooklyn Royal Giants to win the New York City championship.\n\nBrown's career came to an abrupt end in 1925. He went to a bar one night with Frank Wickware and Oliver Marcelle. Marcelle was a third baseman with a reputation for trouble off the field. A fight erupted at the bar, possibly involving cocaine, and Brown killed one of the participants {Benjamin Adair} April 27,1925. Wickware and Marcelle were questioned the next day at the ballpark, but Brown had disappeared.\n\nThe FBI searched for Brown but he was never officially seen again. Rumors abounded that he continued playing baseball under the alias \"Lefty Wilson\" with semi-professional teams through the Midwestern United States. Lefty Wilson toured with Gilkerson's Union Giants in 1926, a white team in Bertha, Minnesota in 1927 and 1928, and he was rumored to have played in Sioux City, Iowa in 1929 and Little Falls, Minnesota in 1930. More unsubstantiated rumors claimed that Brown died in mysterious circumstances in Denver, Colorado in 1930. However, Lefty Wilson shows up again pitching for the Gilkerson's Union Giants again in 1932. Reportedly, he was alive in 1938 .\n\nIn 1927, a \"Pittsburgh Courier\" column solicited opinions for the best black baseball player of all time. On April 2, John Henry Lloyd announced his list which included Dave Brown. When the \"Pittsburgh Courier\" announced a similar list in 1952, they included Brown on their second team.\n\n\n\n"}

He went to Mexico as a young man, and upon the recommendation and financing of his uncle, conquistador and wealthy mine owner Diego de Ibarra, Francisco was placed at the head of an expedition to explore northwest from Zacatecas in 1554. The young Ibarra noted silver in the vicinity of present-day Fresnillo, but passed it by. He explored further and founded towns at San Martín and Avino, where the silver mines made him a mine owner in his own right. Ibarra's expedition to Zacatecas was later documented by Spanish historian Baltasar Obregón, who traveled with Ibarra in 1554.\n\nIn 1562, Ibarra headed another expedition to push farther into northwest Mexico. In particular, he was searching for the fabled golden city of Copala (also called Cibola). He did not find the mythical treasure, but explored and conquered what is now the Mexican state of Durango. Ibarra was appointed governor of the newly formed province of Nueva Vizcaya (New Biscay) in 1562, and the following year he founded the city of Durango to be its capital.\n\nIn 1564, Ibarra, following rumors of rich mineral deposits, crossed the Sierra Madre Occidental to conquer what is now southern Sinaloa. Prospectors discovered silver veins in the new territory, and in 1565, de Ibarra founded the towns of Copala and .\n\nSoldiers under Ibarra's direction explored north from Durango in 1567, and founded the town of Santa Bárbara in present-day Chihuahua to mine the silver they found there.\n\nFrancisco de Ibarra died on 3 June 1575 in Pánuco, Sinaloa, one of the silver-mining cities that he founded.\n"}
{"id": "10399129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10399129", "title": "Haruhi Fujioka", "text": "Haruhi Fujioka\n\nAt the start of the \"Ouran High School Host Club\" manga and anime, Haruhi enters the prestigious Ouran Academy on a scholarship. Looking for a quiet place to study, she stumbles upon the school's male-only host club, where she was initially mistaken for a boy due to her short hair and gender-neutral clothing. After knocking over a highly expensive vase, the club forces her to work away her debt. Having a \"low perception of gender\", Haruhi joins the club as a host, keeping her sex secret from the club's clientele.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, Haruhi dislikes being forced to work for the host club. However, as the plot advances, Haruhi slowly grows less introverted and starts to realize that the boys of the host club have become her best friends who are helping her learn and grow to be a better person. The chapters consist of comedic explorations of shoujo clichés and gender performance. Unlike other shoujo heroines that \"Ouran High School Host Club\" parodies, Haruhi is an independent, hard-working asocial \"tsukkomi\"-type character who embraces a genderqueer or \"gender-ambivalent\" identity.\n\nCaitlin Glass, the English voice actress of Haruhi, has noted that the character is both among her most challenging and her favorite roles. In an interview with \"Swerve\", she described how difficult it was to \"believably [be] a boy [while] still appealing even to a male audience.\" Taking the dual role of director and lead character, Glass said she felt like she had \"something to prove\" and, initially, she was under great pressure.\n\nAfro Samurai of \"IGN\" listed Haruhi among his 25 \"greatest anime characters\". Stating that while the reverse harem genre of anime had been \"done to death\" by the time the \"Ouran High School Host Club\" anime was released, Haruhi's character went against the established tropes of the genre. Described as \"super tomboyish, demure, and not at all moe,\" Haruhi is considered a good contrast to the eccentric cast of rich boys. In an anime review, \"IGN\"s D.F. Smith praised both Caitlin Glass and Maaya Sakamoto for their performance as Haruhi in their respective languages, reporting that it is a \"tricky role\". Sakamoto was nominated for a Seiyu Award in 2007 for her portrayal of Haruhi.\n\nRose Bridges of \"Anime News Network\" lauded Haruhi as one of the \"freshest elements\" of the anime. Comparing Haruhi to Tohru Honda from \"Fruits Basket\" and Tsukushi Makino from \"Boys Over Flowers\" because of her strong sense of empathy and her \"take-no-crap\" attitude respectively, Bridges praised the character for her intelligence, ability to speak her mind and her \"blasé approach to gender roles.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Mary Sue\", Alenka Figa listed Haruhi at the top of her top five queer characters in anime. Noting that plots based on gender confusion are common in anime, Figa states that the trope was subverted quickly when Haruhi admits to her gender-blindness in the first episode. Aja Romano of \"The Daily Dot\" pointed Haruhi out as one of the \"rare cases\" where a character in an anime embraces a genderqueer or \"gender-ambivalent\" identity, refusing to return to what she described as \"safely heteronormative territory.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "45605103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45605103", "title": "Iacob Iacobovici", "text": "Iacob Iacobovici\n\nIacob Melcon Iacobovici (November 18, 1879 – October 9, 1959) was a Romanian surgeon.\n\nBorn in Costești, Botoșani County, his family were peasants of Armenian origin who had arrived in the Moldavia region over a century earlier. His parents Melcon and Roza were poor, which meant that their son struggled materially as he passed through A. T. Laurian High School in Botoșani and the University of Bucharest's medical faculty. He graduated from the latter institution in 1905 with a thesis on fetal arteriology that he defended before professors Paul Petrini, Thoma Ionescu, Dimitrie Gerota, Anastasie Obregia and Dimitrie Drăghicescu. The work earned him a \"magna cum laude\" degree and a letter of commendation from Wilhelm von Waldeyer. While a student, he became an extern in 1901, an intern at Spitalul Brâncovenesc in 1902, and an assistant in the anatomy department the same year.\n\nIn 1907, Iacobovici won a competition to become assistant to Ionescu at Colțea Hospital. In 1912, he became consulting physician at the same institution, as well as librarian of the medical faculty. He remained in Bucharest until 1919, taking part as a combat medic in the Second Balkan War and World War I. He wrote numerous scientific publications and proposed several new surgical techniques. In October 1919, following the union of Transylvania with Romania and the establishment of a medical faculty within the new Cluj University, he was named head of the surgical clinic at Cluj, with the rank of full professor.\n\nThe clinic Iacobovici set up included laboratories for biochemistry, urology, endoscopy, morphology and dissection, as well as ambulatory and emergency departments and sections for trauma, orthopedics, urology and chest surgery. In 1922, he edited a textbook on upper abdominal surgery. In 1926, together with several collaborators, he published a propaedeutics of surgery, the first of its kind in Romania. He served as university rector in 1922-1923, and during his term established Cluj University Press, the country's first university press. In May 1923, as he was walking from his bedroom to his dining room one evening, an assailant fired four shots at him from the street, but missed. The police were convinced the deed was the work of a disgruntled anti-Semitic student.\n\nWhen Iacobovici arrived in Transylvania, there were almost no Romanian surgeons in the province, methods of surgery were obsolete and Romanian-language teaching materials were scarce. Starting under these conditions, he managed to train surgeons who developed departments throughout Transylvania and even in the former Old Kingdom. In 1929, when he had Alexandru Pop appointed lecturer and, implicitly, his successor as clinic head, nearly all the senior physicians quit and went to other cities. In ten years, Iacobovici trained some forty surgeons, who later became department heads and, in some cases, university professors. Among the types of operations in which he innovated were surgery for gastric ulcer, biliary bypass, tuberculosis, lumbar region, neurovegetative features and war wounds; as well as working on thyroid pathology, pulmonary exeresis and renal tumors.\n\nFollowing the accidental death in 1933 of Ernest Juvara, head of the surgery clinic at Spitalul Brâncovenesc, Iacobovici was named as his replacement. At Bucharest, he continued working for a further fifteen years. He created yet another school of surgeons, founded the country's first emergency hospital in 1934, and in 1935 was a founding member of the Romanian Medical Academy. Taken together, around twenty professors emerged from under his tutelage at Cluj and Bucharest. During the National Legionary State, he was temporarily removed from his post of clinic director. After World War II, he showed increasing signs of Parkinson's disease and cardiac sclerosis. He asked to retire in 1947, and left the clinic for good in 1949. He died in 1959 and, in accordance with his last will, was immediately incinerated at Cenușa Crematorium in a simple ceremony. He donated three buildings in Bucharest and his villa at Târgu Ocna to what was now the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy.\n\n"}

During the 1980s he was a regular face on British television, and in two years appeared on 50 weeks of the year. He also worked presenting many corporate events.\n\nBeadle was born in Hackney, East London, on 12 April 1948. His father, a Fleet Street sports reporter, abandoned Jeremy's mother, Marji (9 July 1921 – 9 July 2002), when he learned that she was pregnant. Before Jeremy reached the age of two he was frequently hospitalised and had undergone surgery for Poland syndrome, a rare disorder that stunted growth in his right hand.\n\nHis mother worked as a secretary to help pay to raise him, including a stint for the boxing promoter Jack Solomon. Beadle did not enjoy school and was frequently in trouble. He was eventually expelled from his secondary school, Orpington County Secondary Boys' School. A teacher remarked, \"Beadle, you waffle like a champion but know nothing.\"\n\nAfter his expulsion, he travelled and worked in Europe. He had a number of jobs, at one point taking photographs of topless models, and worked as a skin-diving instructor, lavatory attendant and tour guide. He even briefly worked as a tour guide at the York dungeons. He often said that he gave the best London tour because he realised that what people wanted was stories of blood, sex and death.\n\nBeadle was chosen in 1970 by Tony Elliott, the founder of \"Time Out\", to set up a Manchester edition of the magazine, a venture that was short-lived, though he subsequently maintained a connection with the publication in London. In 1972, North West Arts Association asked him to organise the Bickershaw Festival, and he worked on further musical events over the next couple of years.\n\nIn 1973, as an early member of the Campaign for Real Ale, he was elected to their National Executive and secured the campaign's first television or radio coverage in a one-hour programme on BBC Radio London, which he hosted. It was during this period that his talent for practical jokes became evident, although occasionally this rebounded on him, such as when colleagues left him naked in front of 400 women arriving for their shift. He then started writing for radio and television, going on to provide material for stars such as Terry Wogan, Michael Aspel, Noel Edmonds and Kenny Everett.\n\nBeadle began supplying odd facts and questions to radio and television game shows, such as \"Celebrity Squares\". He sent a number of questions to Bob Monkhouse, the host, without the answers and Monkhouse was so impressed he rang Jeremy to ask him to work on the show. His presenting style on the phone-in programme \"Nightline\" on LBC in London, which he hosted between September 1979 and 22 June 1980 (when he was sacked), led to a cult following. He introduced himself as Jeremy James Anthony Gibson-Beadlebum: \"Jeremy James Anthony Gibson-Beadle is my name and a bum is what I am,\" he explained. He teased his producer as 'Butch' Bavin Cook (b. 12 June).\n\nOn 31 May 1980, he began co-presenting the children's television show \"Fun Factory\" with his LBC co-star Therese Birch, Kevin Day and Billy Boyle. On Capital Radio Beadle presented \"Beadle's Odditarium\", a music show concentrating on strange, bizarre and rare recordings all taken from the archives of producer Phil Swern. From 5 October 1986, Beadle presented \"Beadle's Brainbusters\" on the independent local radio network, with questions written by Beadle and Paul Donnelley. He also became renowned for his off-air pranks and intellectually challenging quizzes. He wrote, devised and presented many television pilots for the highly successful game show company Action Time, then run by Jeremy Fox, son of Paul Fox. Beadle wrote and presented \"The Deceivers\", a BBC2 television series recounting the history of swindlers and hoaxers. The success of this led to using the same format for \"Eureka\", which told the background behind everyday inventions.\n\nBeadle then went on to become nationally famous as one of the presenters of LWT's \"Game for a Laugh\", the first show made by ITV to beat the BBC's shows in the Saturday night ratings battle. This was followed by a hidden-camera style practical joke show, \"Beadle's About\" (1986–1996), which became the world's longest continuously running hidden-camera show.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1997, Beadle presented \"You've Been Framed!\", a family show featuring humorous clips from viewers' home video recordings. An offshoot of this was \"Beadle's Hotshots\", featuring viewers' intentionally funny parodies and sketches, some of which were re-edited and even reshot by a young Edgar Wright in his first industry job; other sketches and scripts were produced by writer/director Chris Barfoot). In total, Beadle hit the UK Number One ratings slot four times.\n\nIn 1995, reflecting his days on LBC, he presented a relatively short-lived but popular Sunday late-evening show on the newly launched Talk Radio UK. As well as his considerable television output as writer, presenter and producer, he appeared in numerous pantomimes and acted as ringmaster for many circuses, notably for Gerry Cottle's. He also worked as a consultant for many television companies, wrote books, and presented quizzes both commercially and for charity. As a radio presenter, he chaired a brief revival of \"Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?\" on BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he started to work on the Bickershaw Festival 40th Anniversary Boxed set project for 2012 in conjunction with Chris Hewitt, who had worked with Beadle on the original event in 1972. (Chris Hewitt continued to work on the project after Beadle died.)\n\nBeadle was living in Highgate, north London, when he was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" on 26 January 1994. He was surprised by Michael Aspel during a school carol concert at a church in nearby Hampstead on 8 December 1993.\n\nBeadle wanted to be the British Robert L. Ripley. A love of trivia was born when his mother bought him \"The Guinness Book of Records\" for Christmas when he was a small boy. This led him to write \"Today's the Day\" (published in UK by WH Allen in 1979 and by Signet in the United States two years later), researched in his own library of 27,000 volumes. The book recounts – for any given day of the year – around half a dozen notable births, deaths or events that occurred on that date, linked to odd or amusing facts. Beadle briefly performed a similar duty on television's \"TV-am\", informing each morning's viewers of prominent events on this date in past years. The scripts were written by Beadle and Paul Donnelley. The format was briefly revived when GMTV replaced TV-am as the ITV breakfast franchise in 1993.\n\nFor more than two years Beadle wrote a daily cartoon series of \"Today's the Day\" for the \"Daily Express\". He worked alongside Irving Wallace and his son David Wallechinsky and daughter Amy Wallace as the biggest contributor to the sex and death chapters of \"The Book of Lists\" and was the London editor of \"The People's Almanac 2\". The Wallaces' book \"The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People\" (Dell (US) Hutchinson (UK), 1981) was researched in part in Beadle's library, which contained an extensive collection of erotic literature.\n\nIn autumn 2007, three new books by Beadle were published: \"Firsts, Lasts & Onlys: Crime\", \"Firsts, Lasts & Onlys: Military\" (both co-authored by the celebrated writer Ian Harrison) and \"Beadle's Miscellany\", the first hundred quizzes from his weekly puzzlers in \"The Independent\". He guest-edited the January 2008 edition of \"True Detective\", which featured contributions from his friends who are crime experts including James Morton, Paul Donnelley, Andrew Rose and Matthew Spicer.\n\nIn 1995, Beadle wrote the foreword to \"Who Was Jack the Ripper?\", a collection of theories and observations about the Victorian serial murderer, published by the veteran true crime book dealer Camille Woolf. It included contributions from experts such as Martin Fido, Colin Wilson, Donald Rumbelow, Colin Kendell and Richard Whittington-Egan. In his foreword Beadle coined the collective noun to describe those interested in the subject \"a speculation of Ripperologists\".\n\nRenowned for his general knowledge, Beadle was host of \"Win Beadle's Money\" (based on the US format \"Win Ben Stein's Money\"). Beadle lost his money only eight times in 52 shows. He wrote and presented a notoriously difficult quiz at London's The Atlantic Grill restaurant then owned by Oliver Peyton, often attended by celebrities and members of the press. He also wrote a quiz for \"The Independent\" every Saturday. He occasionally appeared as a panellist on BBC Radio 4's \"Quote... Unquote\" and in dictionary corner for Channel 4's \"Countdown\".\n\nBeadle was also a winner on the game show 19 Keys, presented by Richard Bacon, defeating Nick Weir, Nicholas Parsons, and fellow Game for a Laugh presenter Henry Kelly (who also did Going for Gold).\n\nAn estimate of Beadle's total charitable fund raising is around £100 million.\n\nIn the 2001 New Year Honours Beadle was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his services to charity. He was a keen supporter of the charity Children With Leukaemia, a disease he suffered from himself in 2005. He spent much time raising money for many different charities with Plastermind his 'outrageous quiz for those who don't like quizzes', as well as a school video venture called CamClass.\n\nBeadle was a patron of The Philip Green Memorial Trust, and he annually hosted a quiz party to raise money for disadvantaged children. Beadle was also the patron of Reach, an organisation providing support and advice for children in the UK with hand or arm deficiencies, and their parents.\n\nHe was a member of Westminster City Council Freemason Lodge No. 2882. Although he did not join this organisation until after his television heyday was over, he quickly became involved with all aspects of English Freemasonry, and particularly its charitable work, often using his celebrity status to assist in raising funds for Masonic charities.\n\nBeadle had Poland syndrome, which manifested itself as a disproportionately small right hand. In 2004, Beadle was diagnosed with cancer of the kidney and underwent a successful operation to remove it. In April 2005, a blood test during a routine post-op medical check-up led to his being diagnosed with CLL. Beadle was successfully treated for this, though two serious illnesses in such a short space of time were detrimental to his general state of health.\n\nOn 25 January 2008, it was reported that Beadle had been admitted to The London Clinic and was subsequently placed in a critical care unit due to severe pneumonia. He died on 30 January 2008, at the age of 59. On 2 February 2008 ITV dedicated that day's episode of \"You've Been Framed\" to Beadle and promoted a tribute webpage to him over the show's credits. The channel's official tribute to Jeremy Beadle was broadcast on 4 February 2008 where various celebrity friends including Lord Sugar paid tribute.\n\nBeadle was cremated at Marylebone Crematorium on 14 February 2008 and interred in Highgate Cemetery (his headstone bears the inscription \"Writer, Presenter, Curator of Oddities\"). A further tribute was aired on Friday 16 May, \"An Audience Without Jeremy Beadle\", hosted by Chris Tarrant and with contributions from Alan Sugar, Henry Kelly, Ken Campbell, Anneka Rice and others.\n\nBeadle's obituary in \"The Daily Telegraph\" claimed that he \"was the most avidly watched presenter on television\". On 15 August 2010 he was the subject of an ITV documentary, \"The Unforgettable Jeremy Beadle\".\n\n\nBooks\n\nVideos\n\nMagazine\n\n"}

It was from Kalanos that Alexander came to know of Dandamis, the leader of their group, whom Alexander later went to meet in the forest.\n\nPlutarch indicates his real name was Sphínēs and that he was from Taxila, but since he greeted people with the word \"Kalē!\" - perhaps \"kallāṇa (mitta)\" \"Greetings (friend)\" - the Greeks called him Kalanos. Kalanos lived at Taxila and led an austere life.\n\nEarly Western scholarship suggested Kalanos was a Jain, but modern scholarship rejects this notion as Jain ascetics are forbidden from using fire and deliberate self-harm due to their convictions about ahimsa and because Taxila and Gandhara were centers of Buddhism and had no Jain presence at all.\n\nPlutarch records that when first invited to meet Alexander, Kalanos \"roughly commanded him to strip himself and hear what he said naked, otherwise he would not speak a word to him, though he came from Jupiter himself.\" Kalanos refused the rich gifts offered by Alexander saying that man's desire cannot be satisfied by such gifts. They believed that, even if Alexander killed them, \"they would be delivered from the body of flesh now afflicted with age and would be translated to a better and purer life.\" Alexander's representative Onesicritus had a discussion with several sages and Alexander was attracted by the criticism on Greek Philosophy by Kalanos. Alexander persuaded Kalanos to accompany him to Persis and stay with him as one of his teachers. Alexander even hinted use of force to take him to his country, to which Kalanos replied philosophically, that \"what shall I be worth to you, Alexander, for exhibiting to the Greeks if I am compelled to do what I do not wish to do?\" Kalanos lived as a teacher to Alexander and represented \"eastern honesty and freedom\".\n\nHe was seventy-three years of age at time of his death. When the Persian weather and travel had weakened him, he informed Alexander that he would prefer to die rather than live as an invalid. He decided to take his life by self-immolation. Although Alexander tried to dissuade him from this course of action, upon Kalanos' insistence the job of building a pyre was entrusted to Ptolemy. Kalanos is mentioned also by Alexander's admirals, Nearchus and Chares of Mytilene. The city where this immolation took place was Susa in the year 323 BC. Kalanos distributed all the costly gifts he got from the king to the people and wore just a garland of flowers and chanted Jain hymns. He presented his horse to one of his Greek pupils named Lysimachus. He did not flinch as he burnt to the astonishment of those who watched. Although Alexander was not personally present at time of his immolation, his last words to Alexander were \"We shall meet in Babylon\". He is said to have prophesied the death of Alexander in Babylon, even though at the time of death of Kalanos, Alexander did not have any plans to go to Babylon.\n\nA letter written by Kalanos to Alexander is preserved by Philo.\n\nA painting by Jean Baptiste de Champaigne depicts \"Alexander the Great receiving the news of the death by immolation of the gymnosophist Calanus\" is displayed at Chateau de Versailles et de Trianon, Versailles.\n\n"}

She is member of the Algonquins of Pikwàkanagàn First Nation in Ontario. She has been recognized by the Canadian Association of Journalists with a Charles Bury Award for her leadership supporting journalists and fighting for media rights, and by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, receiving the Gordon Sinclair Award for her exceptional body of work in television journalism.\n\nPugliese is best known for her work as a journalist/Executive Director of news and current affairs at the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, and as the host of ichannel’s #FAQMP. However, she also worked briefly at CBC, Vision TV and as a Communications Director for the Assembly of First Nations. Pugliese sits on the Canadian Association of Journalists Ethics Committee. Pugliese has acted as a co-chair for the Night for Rights Gala, an event which raises approximately $140,000 annually for rights-based journalism programming, and is organized by Journalist for Human Rights, JHR. Pugliese is an ambassador for Journalist for Human Rights, and works with them to train young indigenous journalists. She frequently speaks in support of the organization.\n\nIn October 2017, the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television announced that Pugliese will be presented with the organization's annual Gordon Sinclair Award for distinguished achievement in journalism at the 6th Canadian Screen Awards.\n\nPugliese was born and raised in Ottawa Ontario, but frequently visited Pikwàkanagàn in her youth. Most of her close family lived off-reserve in Ottawa.\n\nPugliese dropped out of high school three times, eventually enrolling in an alternative high school where she earned her diploma. Although she was a bright student, Pugliese had no intention of attending university, and wanted to be a bartender, until a high school teacher coaxed her into applying to Carleton University's journalism program. She enrolled and graduated with a combined honours in Journalism and History in 1998.\n\nAfter graduating Pugliese worked short-term contracts at CBC Radio Ottawa’s \"Morning Show\", \"Sounds Like Canada\" and CTV television, Ottawa. As a single mother of a young child, Pugliese found it difficult to balance motherhood with the instability of a journalism career. For a time she left journalism and worked as a technical writer in the federal government. Around this time she returned to Carleton University to complete an M.A. in History. Her thesis \"'So, where are you from?' Glimpsing the history of Ottawa-Gatineau's urban Indian communities\" is a history of the off-reserve community she grew up in.\n\nPugliese returned to journalism in 2000, after a professor put her in touch with the APTN. Pugliese became the APTN’s first Parliamentary Correspondent. She credits the APTN’s daycare policy and flexible hours for her ability to re-enter journalism and build a career.\n\nHer son Zackery Liberty is now an adult and a guitarist with the indie rock group Farewell Davidson.\n\nIn 2000 Pugliese heard from a professor that the APTN was about to launch a weekly news magazine show called \"InVision\". It was later rebranded into the nightly APTN National News. From 2000-2006 Pugliese was a member of the Press Gallery and APTN’s Parliamentary Reporter. She also travelled to many Indigenous communities, mostly in Ontario, Quebec and Nunavut. During her time at APTN Pugliese won 3 Native American Journalism Awards and was nominated for a Canadian Association of Broadcasters Gold Ribbon Award. Pugliese left APTN in 2006.\n\nIn 2006, Pugliese joined Vision TV's investigative and current affairs show 360 Vision then led by Sadia Zaman and John Scully. That year the series was a nominee for Best News and Information Series at the 2006 Gemini Awards. Pugliese left after one season.\n\nPugliese joined the Assembly of First Nations as a communications officer in 2007. In this role she also worked with the World Health Organization, and the United Nations. A year later she was promoted to Communications Director. She left the AFN in 2010.\n\nIn 2010 Pugliese returned to journalism, hosting and producing @issue, ichannel's current affairs talk show. In 2011 Pugliese hosted and produced a new flagship program #FAQMP (Frequently Asked Questions for your Member of Parliament). The show was described as an experiment in democracy, and with its hyper-local focus it was favourably compared to a modern twist on Geoff Scott’s 1968 Show \"Your Man on the Hill.\" #FAQMP invited viewers to vote on a website and choose which MP they wanted to appear on the show. Viewers were then invited to submit their own interview questions and topics via social media. Among the MPs who appeared on the show were: Justin Trudeau, Jason Kenney, Dean Del Mastro, Elizabeth May, Bob Rae, Carolyn Bennett, Joy Smith, Pat Martin, and Senator Patrick Brazeau.\n\nSome controversial episodes included: PEI Liberal MP Sean Casey’s admission that he did not support his own party’s 2012 resolution on abortion that would penalize any province that restricted women’s access to abortion (by cutting federal health transfer dollars). Green Party Leader Elizabeth May’s assertion that political parties should be eliminated, and all MPs elected independently also caused a stir. The clip resurfaced and caused debate on reddit in 2014.\n\nThe series garnered a nomination for Best Cross-Platform Project, Non-Fiction at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.\n\nPugliese left in 2012, returning to APTN. #FAQMP lasted for 1 more season under a new host, Kevin O'Keefe.\n\nIn 2012, Pugliese returned to the APTN to lead the news department as the Executive Director of News and Current Affairs. Since her arrival, new programming has been added to the News Department including: \"Nation to Nation\", a half hour political show, and the talk shows \"InFocus\" and \"The Laughing Drum\". During the 2015 federal election, for the first time, APTN National News secured interviews with 3 out of 4 of the national party leaders.\n\nPugliese is an advocate for press freedom and media rights. \n\nPugliese has intervened in Many press freedom cases including cases for protection of sources (Regina vs Ben Makuch of Vice) and she intervened in cases where journalists faced charges for being on the scene of protests and accidents for the purpose of reporting news. \n\nPugliese has also been to South Sudan as a \"expert trainer\" as part of Journalists for Human Rights program for press freedom. \n\nPugliese sat on the Canadian Association of Journalists Ethics committee and is a frequent presenter on media ethics. \n\nShe has also presented to Parliamentary and Senate Committees on a variety of issues related to threats to Canadian journalism and press freedom. \n\nIn 2017, Pugliese was awarded the Canadian Association of Journalists Charles Bury Award, by then CAJ President Nick Taylor-Vaisey. In particular Taylor-Vaisey noted Pugliese's contributions to fighting for press freedom.\n\n\"When it comes to supporting journalists and fighting for journalism, APTN punches above its weight,\" said Taylor-Vaisey. \"They fight for press freedom in the courts...\"\n\nIn her acceptance speech Pugliese reccounted some of the early struggles of setting up the \"first aboriginal broadcaster in the world\" adding: \"Yes.

At the age of 12, he formed his own rocket society. He attended Technical University of Berlin and studied celestial mechanics and nuclear physics under such luminaries as Hans Geiger and Werner Heisenberg, attaining his degree in Aeronautical Engineering.\n\nHe worked at Peenemünde as a propulsion engineer from 1942 to 1945 with Walter Thiel, then went to the United States with other German rocket scientists and technicians under \"Operation Paperclip\" in 1947. He worked for a short time with the Von Braun Rocket Team at Huntsville.\n\nIn 1948, while working for the U.S. Army, Ehricke wrote a story about a manned mission to Mars called \"Expedition Ares\". It anticipated the many challenges that still face explorers who will make the journey in the future. In the same year he wrote a book with Wernher von Braun, \"The Mars Project\", which detailed how man could travel to Mars using a ferry system.\n\nUpon leaving government service Ehricke worked at Bell Aircraft, and then for Convair in 1952. While at Convair, he designed the D-1 Centaur, the world's first upper-stage-booster that used liquid hydrogen and oxygen. He also created an early space station design, based on launch by Convair's Atlas rocket. The NEXUS reusable rocket was a 1960s concept design by a group at General Dynamics led by Krafft Ehricke. Also, during his stay at General Dynamics, he participated on Project Orion (nuclear propulsion).\n\nIn 1966, Ehricke was inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame for his engineering achievements and his influential ideas on the purpose of space exploration.\n\nKrafft Ehricke undertook a major, multi-decade study of the industrial development of the Moon, which he described as Earth's \"seventh continent.\" His lunar industrialization concept was based on the most advanced technologies, such as nuclear-powered freight transporters, and using fusion energy to power his city, Selenopolis, on the Moon.\n\nEhricke received a space burial on April 21, 1997, when a rocket sent a small amount of his cremated remains into Earth orbit.\n\nHe married Ingeborg Ehricke (born 12 September 1922).\n\nEhricke was an accomplished practitioner in the field of astrodynamics and its applications. His two-volume work entitled Space Flight is probably the most complete and surely the most useful introduction to this complex subject ever written. It focuses on methods for exploration of the solar system. He clearly demonstrated the so-called \"gravity assist\" method for utilizing hyperbolic encounters with an intermediate planet to increase (or decrease) the velocity and orbital elements of a space vehicle. This technique had opened the entire solar system to robotic exploration by using what he called \"Instrumented Comets.\" Examples include the Voyager missions to the outer planets and the recent successful New Horizons mission to Pluto. His contribution to this important field of exploration has been neglected for many decades and incorrect claims of \"invention\" of what is now called gravity assist were made by Minovitch.\n\nEhricke promoted a philosophical concept called the \"Extraterrestrial Imperative.\" This idea refers to Ehricke's belief that it was the responsibility of humanity to explore space and exploit the resources of the Solar System, in order to sustain the development of the species. There are no external \"limits to growth,\" Ehricke insisted, because while the Earth is a \"closed system,\" the exploration of space opens the universe to humanity. For Ehricke, human creativity has no limits.\n\n"}

He was a radical journalist, and he was executed for treason by the Japanese government.\n\nHe also contributed articles to \"Sekai Fujin\" (\"Women of the World\"), a socialist women's newspaper.\n\nKōtoku moved from his birthplace, the town of Nakamura in Kōchi Prefecture, to Tokyo in his mid-teens and after graduating from the Tokyo School of English, became a journalist there in 1893. He joined Katayama Sen in the \"Society of the Study of Socialism\". From 1898 onwards he was a columnist for the \"Yorozu Chōhō (Everything Morning News)\", one of the more radical daily papers of the time; however, he resigned that position when the paper switched to a pro-war stance in October 1903 in the buildup to the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nThe following month he co-founded the \"Heimin Shimbun\" (\"Common Peoples' Newspaper\") with another \"Yorozu Chōhō\" journalist, Toshihiko Sakai. This paper's outspoken anti-war stance and disregard of the state's press laws landed its editors in trouble with the government on numerous occasions, and Kōtoku himself served a five-month jail sentence from February to July 1905.\n\nIn 1901, when Kōtoku together with Katayama, Sakai and Abe Isoo took part in the first attempt to found the Japanese Social Democratic Party, he was not an anarchist, but a socialist – Sakai and Kōtoku were the first to translate \"The Communist Manifesto\" into Japanese, which appeared in an issue of the \"Heimin Shimbun\" and which got them heavily fined.\n\nHis political thoughts first began to turn to a more libertarian philosophy when he read Kropotkin's \"Fields, Factories and Workshops\" in prison. In his own words, he \"had gone [to jail] as a Marxian Socialist and returned as a radical Anarchist.\"\n\nIn November 1905 Kōtoku travelled to the United States in order to freely criticise the Emperor of Japan, whom he now saw as the linchpin of capitalism in Japan. During his time in the United States, Kōtoku was further exposed to the philosophies of anarchist communism and European syndicalism.\n\nHe had taken Kropotkin's \"Memoirs of a Revolutionist\" as reading material for the Pacific voyage; after he arrived in California, he began to correspond with Kropotkin and by 1909 had translated \"The Conquest of Bread\" from English to Japanese.\n\nOne thousand copies of his translation were published in Japan in March of that year and distributed to students and workers.\n\nOn Kōtoku's return to Japan, in June 1906, a public meeting was held to welcome him. At this meeting, on June 28, he spoke on \"The Tide of the World Revolutionary Movement\", which he said was flowing against parliamentary politics (i.e. Marxist party politics) and in favour of the general strike as \"the means for the future revolution\".\n\nThis was an anarcho-syndicalist view, and one which, because anarcho-syndicalism was growing in the United States at the time, with the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World, showed the American influence clearly.\n\nHe followed this speech with a number of articles, the most well-known of which was \"The Change in My Thought (On Universal Suffrage)\".\nIn these articles, Kōtoku was now advocating direct action rather than political aims such as universal suffrage, which was a shock to many of his comrades and brought the schism between Anarchist Communists and Social Democrats to the Japanese working class movement.\n\nThis split was made clear when the re-launched \"Heimin Shimbun\" folded in April 1907 and was replaced two months later by two journals: the Social Democrat \"Social News\" and the \"Osaka Common People's Newspaper\", which argued from an anarchist position, in favour of direct action.\n\nAlthough there were anarchists who preferred peaceful means, such as the dissemination of propaganda, many anarchists in this period turned to terrorism as means of overthrowing the state and achieving Anarchist Communism, or at least hitting out against the state and authority. Repression of publications and organizations, such as the Socialist Party of Japan, and \"public peace police law\", which effectively prevented trade union organizations and strikes, were both factors in this emerging trend in Japan.\n\nIn the episode which became known as the High Treason Incident (\"Taigyaku Jiken\"), police arrested five anarchists for possessing bomb-making equipment, which was allegedly intended for a plot to assassinate Emperor Meiji.\n\nThis was followed by a wave of arrests of political dissidents, including Kōtoku. Though there was conclusive evidence against five, on January 18, 1911, twenty-six anarchists were convicted – mostly on circumstantial evidence. Twenty-four were sentenced to death, and twelve were actually executed – Kōtoku among them. While he may have known of the plot to kill the Emperor in its initial stages, he had certainly distanced himself from it.\n\nKōtoku was hanged along with ten others on January 24, 1911 (the one woman, Suga Kanno, was executed the following day because it was already turning dark).\n\nIn 1965 the Japanese Supreme Court refused a plea to reopen his case and that of the others executed with him.\n\nHis final work is \"Kirisuto Massatsuron\" (基督抹殺論, On the Obliteration of Christ). In this book, he claimed that Jesus was a mythical and unreal figure.\n\n\n"}

Contrary to popular misconception, he was not a khan (king), but a warlord and a kingmaker for several khans, and the de facto regent of the Horde in the 1370s. His defeat in Battle of Kulikovo marked the beginning of the decline of the Horde, as well as his own.\n\nMamai became governor, sometime in the second half of the 1350s, of a territory that later would become the Crimean Khanate. During the rule of Berdi Beg (1357–59) Mamai was appointed as \"beqlar beg\" (beylerbey), a position simultaneously combining the duties of general of the army, minister of foreign affairs, and the head of the supreme court.\n\nUpon the assassination of Berdi Beg by Qulpa in 1359, Mamai associated himself with one of the coalitions formed to depose Qulpa. During that period of time the Golden Horde was in relative chaos; numerous regional governors were striving to become the Khan. Qulpa eventually was killed by Nawruz Beg who was himself assassinated less than six months later. Mamai, who was not a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, played a key role in promoting and supporting rival khans of the White Horde (western part of Golden Horde). In 1361 he supported Ğabdullah, son of Uzbeg Khan, who became Khan in Crimea. Upon the death of Ğabdullah in 1370, Mamai supported Bulak under regency of Tulun Beg Khanum, who only briefly enjoyed power before being replaced by his main opponent Urus in 1372.\n\nAfter being badly defeated by Russians under Dmitri Donskoi first in 1378 at the Battle of the Vozha River and then at the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), Mamai began to assemble a large force to punish Dmitri. But he was defeated by Tokhtamysh on the banks of the Kalka River and was either executed by Tokhtamysh or assassinated by the Genoese after fleeing to Caffa. The death of Mamai paved the way for the next khan to reunify the Golden Horde.\n\nThe memory of Mamai has endured for centuries. Contemporary Russian language has an expression \"как Мамай прошёл\" (\"kak Mamaj prošjol\"), which translates roughly to \"it's as if Mamai came through here\", used to describe an utter mess.\n\nThe burial of Mamai was found by the native Crimean and famous Russian painter Ivan Aivazovsky. Mamai was buried in a village of \"Şeyh Mamay\" (today Aivazovske, Kirovske Raion).\n\nKhan Mamatsios or Mamatzios, Mamatsou,Mamatsu (Mamai-son) Macedonie was a supposed son of Mamai. One of his sons, Manzur Kiyat, purportedly escaped to Lithuania, and, serving Grand Prince Vytautas the Great, received the title of Prince of Hlinsk with multiple estates around the modern city of Poltava (Ukraine). These legendary events could have taken place in the 15th century, although the first documented mention of the Glinski princes is made in 1437. Michael Glinski was the most illustrious member of the family: he studied at the German university, took part as a knight in the Italian Wars, was the most powerful man in Lithuania in the 16th century, but later rebelled and run away with his brothers to Muscovy and helped the Russians to retake the city of Smolensk. His niece Elena Glinskaya was married to Vasily III, Grand Prince of Moscow, and Ivan the Terrible was her son.\n"}

{"id": "207640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207640", "title": "Mirabeau B. Lamar", "text": "Mirabeau B. Lamar\n\nMirabeau Buonaparte Lamar (August 16, 1798 – December 19, 1859), an attorney born in Georgia, became a Texas politician, poet, diplomat and soldier. He was a leading Texas political figure during the Texas Republic era. He was elected as the second President of the Republic of Texas after Sam Houston. He was known for waging war against the Cherokee and Comanche people to push them out of Texas and for establishing a fund to support public education.\n\nLamar was born in 1798 in Louisville, Georgia, and grew up at Fairfield, his father's cotton plantation near Milledgeville, then the state capital. His father's family were descended from French Huguenot Thomas Lamar, who had settled in Maryland in 1660, and they had connections throughout Georgia and the South. As a child, Lamar loved to read and educated himself through books. Although he was accepted to Princeton College, he chose not to attend. He started work as a merchant and then ran a newspaper, but both of those enterprises failed.\n\nIn 1823, Lamar's family connections helped him to gain a position as the private secretary to newly elected Georgia Governor George M. Troup. In this position, Lamar issued press releases and toured the state giving speeches on behalf of the governor. On one of his trips, he met Tabitha Burwell Jordan, whom he married in 1826. They had a daughter together.\n\nWhen Troup lost his reelection bid in 1828, Lamar moved with his family to Columbus, Georgia, where he established the \"Columbus Enquirer.\" This venture was much more successful than his previous business attempts. In 1830 his wife Tabitha died of tuberculosis. Lamar was deeply affected and took time to recover his drive. He withdrew his name from consideration for re-election to the Georgia Senate, in which he had served one term.\n\nAfter traveling, Lamar began to study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1833 and ran an unsuccessful campaign for a seat in the U.S. Congress.\n\nLamar's brother Lucius committed suicide in 1834. A grief-stricken Lamar began traveling again to ease his sorrow. In the summer of 1835, he reached Texas, then part of Mexico. He decided to stay, where he was visiting his friend James Fannin. He had recently settled there and was working as a slave trader in Velasco.\n\nAfter a trip back to Georgia, Lamar returned to Texas. Learning of a battle for independence, he traveled with his horse and sword to join Sam Houston's army in spring 1836, and distinguished himself with bravery at the Battle of San Jacinto. On the eve of the battle, Lamar courageously rescued two surrounded Texans, an act that drew a salute from the Mexican lines. One of those rescued was Thomas Jefferson Rusk, later appointed as Texas Secretary of War. Lamar was promoted that night from private to Colonel and given command of the cavalry during the battle the following day.\n\nHouston noted in his battle report: \"Our cavalry, sixty-one in number, commanded by Mirabeau B. Lamar, (whose gallant and daring conduct on the previous day, had attracted the admiration of his comrades and called him to that station,) placed on our right, completed our line...\"\n\nAfter Texas achieved independence from Mexico, Lamar was appointed as the Secretary of War in the interim Texian government. In 1836, he was elected to the position.\n\nLamar, the unanimous choice as nominee of the Democratic Party for president to succeed Houston, was elected. He was inaugurated on December 1, 1838. Houston talked for three hours in his farewell address, \"which so unnerved Lamar that he was unable to read his inaugural speech.\" It was given by his aide, Algernon P. Thompson. Lamar's vice president was David G. Burnet.\n\nSeveral weeks later, in his first formal address to the Texas Congress, Lamar urged that the Cherokee and Comanche tribes be driven from their lands in Texas, even if the tribes had to be destroyed. He proposed to create a national bank and to secure a loan from either the United States or Europe. Finally, he stated his opposition to potential annexation to the United States and desire to gain recognition of the Republic of Texas by European nations.\n\nHe ordered attacks against the Indian tribes. In 1839 Texan troops drove the Cherokee bands from the state. Houston's friend, Chief Bowles, was killed in battle, and Houston was furious with Lamar. The government conducted a similar campaign against the Comanche. Although losing many lives, the Comanche resisted leaving the area. Lamar believed the \"total extinction\" of the Indian tribes was necessary to make the lands available to whites. He drove the Indians out at the Battle of the Neches, where 500 Texans attacked 800 American Indians of several different tribes. Of these 800 Indians, between 400–500 were women, children, and elders. The Texans and Rangers that attacked the tribes were fully armed, while the Indians had an estimated 16–24 rifles and pistols. Before the attack, Duwali, Gatunwali, Big Mush, and other chiefs and leaders asked for time to gather their crops, then they would go in peace, but Lamar would not wait. Lamar ordered the Secretary of War, Albert Sydney Johnston, and General Thomas J. Rusk to run them out of Texas. Some say he said: \"Just kill them all.\"\n\nLamar appointed a commission to select a permanent site for the capital of the Republic. After two months of debate, they recommended the small town of Waterloo, along the Colorado River toward the center of the state. The town was renamed Austin after the pioneer. By October 1839, all of the records and employees were relocated there from Houston. That same year, Lamar founded the Texas State Library (presently known as the Texas State Library and Archives Commission).\n\nDuring his administration, Lamar sent three separate agents to Mexico to negotiate a peace settlement. All failed. Lamar failed to gain official recognition for Texas from Great Britain, France, and Belgium; it always eluded the would-be nation. He did succeed in getting the three nations to send observers, who would provisionally investigate the issue. He did not succeed in getting loans approved from them. To fill the treasury, he authorized issuance of a large amount of Republic of Texas paper money, known as Redbacks. The paper money was virtually worthless. Spending doubled during Lamar's term and, combined with the worthless currency, caused financial difficulties for the government.\n\nLamar wanted the Rio Grande to be the western boundary of Texas. He wanted to send an expedition to New Mexico to conquer it, and convince the residents, still loyal to Mexico, to join the Republic. The Texas Congress refused to fund the expedition in 1839 and 1840. In June 1841, Lamar took $89,000 from the treasury and sent an expedition on his own initiative. It was questioned on constitutional grounds. Its members were arrested when they reached Santa Fe, and were told they would soon be released. Instead, under guard, they were marched to prison in Mexico City, and many died during the journey.\n\nLamar has been called \"the Father of Texas Education\" because of his provisions of land to support it. During his administration, he convinced the legislature to set aside three leagues of land in each county to be devoted to school development. He also allotted 50 leagues of land for the support of two universities, later developed as Texas A&M University (1876), under the Morrill Act, and the University of Texas (1883). Although no facilities were constructed during his term, he provided the base for a statewide public school system. Government gave 18,000 acres of public land for public schools. He wanted education to be a priority to cultivate a knowledgeable citizenry.\n\nIn keeping with other slave societies in the South, Texas prohibited the few free blacks from schools. A public school system was not firmly established until after the American Civil War, when the Reconstruction era legislature created an endowment to finance a school system. In 1869, it passed a law to give the public school fund the proceeds from sale of public lands. The constitution of that year authorized the legislature to establish school districts and appoint directors. Freedmen's children were included in the system, despite much opposition.\n\nWhen Lamar left office in 1841, Texas was almost 7 million dollars in debt, the majority of which was accrued from his policies.\n\nHouston was elected again as president after Lamar. The latter returned to service in the army, and distinguished himself in the U.S. Army at the Battle of Monterrey during the Mexican–American War. During this period of time, money was tight in Texas; Lamar borrowed money from his banker cousin Gazaway Bugg Lamar. Some of the letters on this subject between the two are amusing. In late 1847, he was assigned as a post commander at Laredo, but disliked the job as he wanted more action.\n\nLamar was elected from Eagle Pass in the Texas Legislature for several years after Texas was annexed to the United States in 1845. In 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Lamar as the Minister to Nicaragua, and a few months later to Costa Rica. He served in Managua for twenty months before returning to Texas in October 1859 because of poor health. He died of a heart attack at his Richmond plantation on December 19, 1859.\n\nLamar's volume of collected poems, \"Verse Memorials,\" was published in 1857 (New York, W.P. Fetridge & Co., 224 pages).\n\n\nLamar was known for his quote:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29226008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29226008", "title": "Nadikerianda Chinnappa", "text": "Nadikerianda Chinnappa\n\nNadikerianda Chinnappa (1875–1931) was an Indian compiler, poet, translator, army man, police officer, cricket player, singer and philanthropist from Kodagu. \n\nThe Nadikerianda clan name originated from the words \"Nadu keri\" ('Central village') and the suffix \"anda\" which means 'belonging to'. Incidentally, Nadikeri is the name of a village in South Kodagu as well. According to a family tree drawn by Nadikerianda Chinnappa himself the earliest remembered ancestors of the clan were Nadikerianda Aiyanna and his wife Mayamma who lived around 1600 CE. This family tree was drawn up in 1918. The most notable legendary members of this clan were Nadikerianda Devayya and Kaaruvanna, the first was a folk ballad hero whose clan was responsible for the Malethirike shrine on top of the Somagiri peak, near the Nadikerianda ancestral house in Karada village. He was cursed by a powerful tantric. Kaaruvanna was his heroic brother who redeemed his spirit. They are considered to be the Kaarana or Kaarona (revered ancestors) of the clan. (Ramachandrachar 4:1994)\n\nNadikerianda Chinnappa was born in 1875 in the village of Karada, Napoklu naad in Coorg (now Kodagu) to Kodava parents Nadikerianda Aiyanna (not to be mistaken for the early ancestor who had the same name) and Pattamada Ponnavva. They had eight children, four daughters and four sons; Chinnappa was the fifth eldest, he had two elder sisters, two elder brothers (Subbayya and Kaalappa), two younger sisters and one younger brother. His mother was a lady of the Pattamada clan who knew horse-riding. (Ramachandrachar 5:1994)\n\nAfter matriculating in Mercara from the Central High School he did his F.A.(First Year Arts) from Mangalore. In college he was good at sports, especially in Hockey and Cricket, and in studies. He got married to his deceased brother Subbayya's widow, Nanjavva, in accordance to tradition, in Coorg and worked as a teacher in Mercara Central High School.\n\nIn 1899 he joined the revenue department and became a Senebaayi (Shanbhog or Accountant). That year in September he wrote an English poem, 'My Position as Shanbog', voicing his frustration with his job. The following year he became a Revenue Inspector and in 1902 he joined the Coorg Regiment of the army and rose to become a Subedar-Major. When the regiment was disbanded in 1904 he joined the Police Department, underwent training in Vellore and became a sub-Inspector in Kushalnagar. Thereafter he served in Napoklu, Srimangala and Virajpet for some five or six years each until he was made Prosecuting sub-Inspector and posted in Madikeri. Later he became a Prosecuting Inspector in Coorg.\n\nHis job in the Police Force required him to travel on horseback to the villages nestled in the valleys and hills of Kodagu. While he went about his duties, he witnessed local festivals and listened to folk-songs that were a part of his culture and was fascinated by them. He feared that these traditions and songs that were handed down orally over the generations would in time be forgotten, because of the dominance of the English language, and influence of the cultures of the neighbouring areas. He got acquainted with several folk-singers and often, when he returned after his day's work, he brought them home on his horse. He asked his wife to feed them and having served them local toddy, he got them to sing the folk-songs they knew, as they beat the dudi (small, hand-held, hourglass-shaped Coorg drum), while he transcribed the words of the songs, late into the night. By the year 1922 he had compiled many folk-songs and gathered enough material on the customs and traditions of Kodavas for his book, which he called the Pattole Palame. He also collected nearly 750 Kodava idioms and proverbs for the book.\n\n‘Pattole' is derived from patt-pole which means 'silk-like', and 'Palame' means 'lore' or 'stories'. Thus Pattole Palame stands for 'Silken Lore'. There is yet another interpretation of the title. In the olden days, family histories, rituals and other records were scripted on palm leaves by astrologers. These ancient, scripted leaves called Pattole (patt=silk, ole=palm leaf) or 'silken palm leaf' are still preserved in many Kodava Ainmanes (ancestral homes). Palame also referred to the hereditary oral tradition of folk songs and ballads among the Kodavas.\n\nThe Pattole Palame, a collection of Kodava folksongs and traditions compiled in the early 1900s by Nadikerianda Chinnappa, was first published in 1924. Some British officials who were interested in Indology(C. S. Sooter and C. Hilton Brown) encouraged Chinnappa in his effort and asked some prominent Kodavas – District Magistrate Rao Saheb (later Dewan Bahadur) Ketolira Chengappa, Retd. Mysore Councillor Rao Bahadur Kodanda Madayya and Retd. Assistant Commissioner Kodandera\nKuttayya to review his draft book. When these reviewers commended the book, C.S.Sooter, the then Commissioner of Coorg, got the British Government to provide financial assistance to the author to publish it. Kullachanda Karumbayya was the proof examiner for the book.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the book consists of folksongs that were handed down orally through generations. Many of these songs are sung even today during marriage and death ceremonies, during Kodava festivals relating to the seasons and during festivals in honour of local deities and heroes. Traditionally known as \"Balo Pat\", these songs are sung by four men who beat dudis (small, handheld, hourglass-shaped Coorg drums) as they sing. The songs have haunting melodies and evoke memories of times long past. Kodava folk dances are performed to the beat of many of these songs.\n\nIn the second edition of \"Pattole Palame\" (or 'Silken Lore'), published by the University of Mysore in 1975, the editor describes it as one of the earliest, if not the earliest, extensive collection of folklore of any Indian community written in an Indian language by an Indian. The fourth edition of the Pattole Palame was published in 2002 by the Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy.\n\nIn 1929, Chinnappa's translation of the Bhagwat Gita into Kodava thakk, called Bhagvathanda Patt, got published. This was written in the style of the Balopattu (Palame songs) and in a simple manner which could be understood by common people as well.\n\nOn 1 October 1917, Nadikerianda Chinnappa wrote a patriotic song in Kodava thakk \"Sri Moola Kanniye\" ('Primal Goddess'). He called this the \"Swadesha Priya Keerthana\" (literally 'Hymn of the love for self-rule') and the 'National Anthem'. This song is dedicated to the Goddess Kaveri, the patron of Kodagu and the Kodavas. One must note that this song was written in the pre-Independence age when the British Raj ruled over India and Indians were being stirred by the call for a sovereign nation ruled by themselves.\n\nThis song was included in the 'Introduction' of the original version of the Pattole Palame that was released in 1924, but was inadvertently omitted in the second and the third editions, that came out in 1975 and 1995. However, in the fourth (2002) and fifth (2006) editions these omissions were noticed by the grandchildren of Chinnappa, who had been abroad those many years, and hence subsequently included. Chinnappa's family members and relatives sing this song as their daily prayer.\n\nBetween 1913 and 1920 Grierson began the first Linguistic Survey of India. He wanted knowledgeable representatives of various Indian languages to translate a biblical parable into their language and to either sing a song or to narrate a story from their language. Needless to say Nadikerianda Chinnappa, who was well-versed in both English and Kodava thakk (besides Kannada), was chosen as the representative of the Kodava language.(Biddappa:20 1996) In 1922, after narrating the Kodava thakk rendering of the biblical parable 'Prodigal son', he sang his own composition, the poem titled \"The Coorg national anthem: Swadēsi priya kirtane\" ('Patriot's hymn'). These gramophone recordings became part of the Linguistic Survey of India collection. (Ramachandrachar 7:1994)\n\nA copy of these recordings were kept in the British Library's 'Sound Archives' in London and in the Madras Museum. This was digitised recently by the Linguistics Department of the University of Chicago Kodava thakk is called Kodaga and it is wrongly identified as being a language of the erstwhile Madras province. The archives don't credit Chinnappa, they simply state that the narrator is unknown. Upon hearing the recording in the Madras museum in the early 1970s, his son, Subbayya, who had known about the recording, recognised his father's voice. Chinnappa's grandson N. S. Nanjappa has since informed the concerned authorities in the University of Chicago about the name of the narrator.\n\nNadikerianda Chinnappa was a renaissance man of his times. He was a compiler, poet, translator, army man, police officer, cricket player, historian, singer and philanthropist.\n\nAlthough he was best known for his compilation work, the Pattole Palame, he wrote original work in three languages: Kodava thakk, Kannada and English. Chinnappa was also a well-known Kodava thakk poet, his most famous work being Bhagavanthanda Paat, the translation of the Bhagavad Gita into Kodava thakk in the folksong style. His popular poem \"Sri Moola Kanniye\" ('The Primal Goddess'),in Kodava thakk, is called the Kodava anthem. He also wrote a well-known poem in Kannada and it was titled \"Somagirija Deva\", on the deity of the Nadikerianda clan, at the Malethirike shrine.\n\nHe used to play different sports regularly at the Victoria Club in Virajpet. A very good bowler in the game of cricket, he was a member of the All Coorg XI cricket team. Beside being part of the Coorg XI cricket team and playing field hockey, he also played billiards and tennis at the Victoria Club. Many of the Europeans who frequented the Club would mutter under their breathe upon losing to him. One day he lost his patience during a game of billiards and he broke the stick. This was seen as a very daring thing for a petty officer under the majesty's service to do before the European officers. (Ramachandrachar 11:1994)\n\nHe was also involved in establishing the Coorg Central Bank and the Coorg Education Fund. As a philanthropist he sponsored the education of many poor and orphaned children in Kodagu. In fact, at any point of time during his employment in the Police Department there used to be around 8–10 students boarding in his Madikeri and Virajpet residences, free of cost. Chinnappa encouraged Boverianda Muthanna, a brilliant student from the neighbouring village of Nariandada, to pursue his higher education by applying to the Coorg Education Fund for financial support. Muttanna studied in Bangalore Central College where he earned a gold medal in English. He joined the College of Engineering, Guindy, in Madras province (now, in Chennai, Tamil Nadu). Later Chinnappa's daughter Gangamma married Muthanna. (Ramachandrachar 10:1994)\n\n\"Nadikerianda Chinnappa\" and Appaneravanda Hardas Appachcha Kavi are the two important poets and writers of the Kodava language. These two pioneers were the earliest known to write Kodava thakk in the Kannada script. Nadikerianda Chinnappa is well known for his magnum opus the 'Pattole Palome', a compilation of the folk songs and hymns of the Kodavas. The Kodava language, called the Kodava thakk ('speech of the Kodavas'), is a tongue rather than a written language, spoken in Kodagu (earlier known as Coorg), a district of Karnataka State in South India. Formerly thought of as a Kannada dialect, it is now recognised as a separate Indian language of the Dravidian family. It has a very recent literature dating from the early 20th century.\n\nThe text of the Pattole Palame was in Kannada and the folksongs, proverbs etc., in it were in Kodava thakk, written using the Kannada script. Nadikerianda Chinnappa had begun translating the work into English in 1925 but he died in 1931, before he could complete it. This work is considered the main literature of the Kodava language. This book is also referred by the Kodava Hindus who seek to clarify ancient traditions. The 119th birth anniversary of Chinnappa was celebrated in 1994 jointly by the Karnataka Janapada (folk) association and the Yakshagana Academy. The Pattole Palame has become the chief text on Kodava customs and traditions for Kodavas.\n\nChinnappa had four sons and two daughters but among them his first three sons died, the surviving children were two daughters (Gangamma and Muthamma) and one son (Subbayya). He also had two step children, a boy and a girl (Aiyanna and Bojamma), the children of Nanjavva and his late elder brother Subbayya. Besides these five surviving children he also adopted his widowed sister Chinnavva's daughter Akkamma.\n\nHis son Subbayya (Mittu), who was a BEd trained teacher, was engaged to marry Neravanda Nanjappa's daughter Ponnamma, who was also a teacher. But before the marriage was to happen, Chinnappa died of cancer, aged 56, on 12 September 1931, only a few months after his retirement from the Police service. Subbayya also wrote poetry and drama. He became the Asst. Education Officer of Coorg, before retirement. He was responsible for starting many High Schools in Coorg. Nadikerianda Subbayya's daughter Nanjamma was married to Gangamma's son Bovverianda Chinnappa. N.S. Ponnappa, the famous cartoonist is Nadikerianda Chinnappa's youngest grandson – son of Subbayya and Ponnamma.\n\nIn the 1970s, over almost three years, Boverianda Chinnappa, Nanjamma and Nanjamma's mother began to copy out in longhand the partially completed rough translation of the Pattole Palame done by Nadikerianda Chinnappa.[5] Nanjamma's parents assisted in translating and interpreting the text. After retirement from Canada in 1995, the Boverianda Chinnappas settled down in Bangalore and began to realise the author's cherished dream of translating the Pattole Palame into English.\n\nWhile they were searching for copies of the original edition of the Pattole Palame, a ninety-year-old farmer and self-taught folk artist, Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, responded to their advertisement. During his youth unable to afford the book he had copied out the entire text word by word under the light of a kerosene lamp, after a hard day's work in the rice fields. He gave this notebook to the Boverianda Chinnappas. They also consulted many elders from Kodagu for the meanings of archaic words in the folk-songs and proverbs.\n\nFinally in 2003, they completed the work and it has been published by Rupa & Co., New Delhi. That same year it was released in Madikeri (Mercara) and in Dakshinachitra, Chennai. N.S. Ponnappa did the cover painting for the book and illustrated it with beautiful line drawings.\n\nBiddappa, Major Puggera P. \"Nadikerianda Chinnappa\" (in Kodava thakk), Bangalore, 1996.\n\nRamachandrachar, D.

He began to attend heder at the age of three. When he was five, his parents moved to Plock. At the age of ten, he was already renowned as a Hebrew scholar. His father wanted him to study for the rabbinate but with the intervention of Baron Wrangel, the governor of Plock, he enrolled in a secular school. He married at eighteen and settled in Makov, where his father-in-law lived, and earned a living as a wool merchant. At the age of 20, he moved to Warsaw and became a regular contributor to the Hebrew daily HaTzefirah. Eventually he wrote his own column and went on to become editor and co-owner. In 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, he moved to London to work with Chaim Weizmann.\n\nSokolow died in London in 1936.\n\nSokolow was a prolific author and translator. His works include a three-volume history of Baruch Spinoza and his times, and various other biographies. He was the first to translate Theodor Herzl's utopian novel \"Altneuland\" into Hebrew, giving it the name \"Tel Aviv\" (literally, \"An Ancient Hill of Spring\"). In 1909, the name was adopted for the first modern Hebrew-speaking city.\n\nIn 1906 Sokolow was asked to become the secretary general of the World Zionist Congress. In the ensuing years, he crisscrossed Europe and North America to promote the Zionist cause. After moving to London, he was a leading advocate for the Balfour Declaration of 1917, in which the British government declared its support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n\nOn 6 February 1917 a meeting was held in Maida Vale with Weizmann to discuss the results of the Picot convention in Paris. Sokolow and Weizmann pressed on after seizing leadership from Gaster; they were granted official recognition from the British government. \nHistorian Martin Kramer argues that securing the assent of Britain's French and American Allies, and of the Vatican, which controlled many Christian Holy Sites in the Land of Israel, was a necessary precondition of the Balfour Declaration. Sokolow secured the support of Pope Benedict XV on 4 May 1917. Pope Benedict described the return of the Jews to Palestine as \"providential; God has willed it.\".\nSokolow secured the assent of the France in the Cambon letter of 4 June 1917, signed by Jules Cambon, head of the political section of the French foreign ministry.\n\nChaim Weizmann wrote to the Manchester Zionist, Harry Sacher, who became a focus for the view that Sokolow and Weizmann had capitulated; forfeiting the right to lead by \"preferring British Imperialism ... to Zionism\". Sokolow acted as Weizmann's eyes and ears in Paris on a diplomatic mission with Sir Mark Sykes to negotiate with the French. The idea that the Jews would form a new kind of Triple Entente under the Ottoman Empire was unsettling to them. Nonetheless the delegation left for Paris on 31 March 1917. One purpose of the Entente was to strengthen the hand of Zionism in USA. \"The Jews represented a powerful political and economic force...if subterranean influence\". Sokolow did not know of the Sykes-Picot Agreement and British/French understanding on Middle Eastern policy matters. He believed that he must report to Weizmann that what France really meant by a \"Greater Syria\", taking the whole of Palestine for themselves. In a series of letters in April and May 1917, Weizmann accused Sokolow of letting the Zionists down in negotiations with France; Sokolow countered by replying that he remained totally committed to a British Palestine.\n\nThe desiderata or things desired by the Jews for their new homeland – \"facilities of colonization, communal autonomy, rights of language and establishment of a Jewish chartered company.\" Sokolow eventual diplomacy triumph for Zionism in Paris \"they accept in principle the recognition of Jewish nationality in the capacity of National Home, local autonomy etc. It is beyond my boldest expectations...\", he wrote. They expected a quid pro quo for support against Germany, which was further made urgent by the entry of USA on 6 April 1917 to the global conflict. They now associated an Allied victory with securing \"Zionist aspirations\", a phrase also used by Sykes in his despatches to Balfour.\nOn 9 April, the Paris conference ended, marking a high-point in Sokolow's career. The Zionists were now open to all diplomatic rounds. Sokolov came to Rome to gain support for the plan of a Jewish state in Palestine, where he spoke to Monsignor Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII. That Pope Benedict XV had vehemently condemned antisemitism a year before was seen as a good omen.\n\nIn Rome, the Vatican City were considering accepting terms. Sokolow's letters asked advice from Weizmann; the amazed Sokolow met the Pope on 6 May. The Zionists began to feel more confident about their patriotism. Sokolow asked for \"moral support\" – a philosophical equality, and immediately wrote Weizmann about the \"expressing of favour\". But Weizmann was not so emotional; being tough hard-headed business-like character. He congratulated Sokolow on the success. Sokolow was called upon to stop at Paris by Jules Cambon and Prime Minister, Alexandre Ribot. They were still concerned that Zionism would cause unlimited damage to world security if unleashed in Bolshevik Russia. \n\nIn 1931 Nahum Sokolow was elected President of the World Zionist Congress, and served in that capacity until 1935, when he was succeeded by Chaim Weizmann. He also served as President of the Jewish Agency for Palestine (now called the Jewish Agency for Israel) between 1931 and 1933 and was succeeded by Arthur Ruppin.\n\nKibbutz Sde Nahum is named for him.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "282522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=282522", "title": "Nicholas of Cusa", "text": "Nicholas of Cusa\n\nNicholas of Cusa (1401 – 11 August 1464), also referred to as Nicholas of Kues and Nicolaus Cusanus (), was a German philosopher, theologian, jurist, and astronomer. One of the first German proponents of Renaissance humanism, he made spiritual and political contributions in European history. A notable example of this is his mystical or spiritual writings on \"learned ignorance,\" as well as his participation in power struggles between Rome and the German states of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nPapal legate to Germany from 1446, he was appointed cardinal for his merits by Pope Nicholas V in 1448 and Prince–Bishop of Brixen two years later. In 1459 he became vicar general in the Papal States.\n\nNicholas of Cusa has remained an influential figure. In 2001, the sixth centennial of his birth was celebrated on four continents and commemorated by publications on his life and work.\n\nNicholas was born in Kues (Latinized as \"Cusa\") in southwestern Germany. He was the second of four children of Johan Krebs (or Cryfftz) and Katherina Roemer. His father was \"a prosperous boat owner and ferryman.\" He entered the Faculty of Arts of the Heidelberg University in 1416 as \"a cleric of the Diocese of Trier\", studying the liberal arts. He seemed to have left Heidelberg soon afterwards, as he received his doctorate in canon law from the University of Padua in 1423. In Padua, he met with the later cardinals Julian Cesarini and Domenico Capranica and became friends with the mathematician Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli. Afterwards, he entered the University of Cologne in 1425 as \"a doctor of canon law,\" which he appears to have both taught and practiced there. In Cologne, he made friends with the scholastic theologian Heymeric de Campo.\n\nFollowing a brief period in Cologne, Nicholas returned to his hometown and became secretary to Otto of Ziegenhain, the Prince–Archbishop of Trier. Otto appointed him canon and dean at the stift of Saint Florinus in Koblenz affiliated with numerous prebends. In 1427 he was sent to Rome as an episcopal delegate. The next year he travelled to Paris to study the writings of Ramon Llull. At the same time he rejected a calling by the newly established University of Leuven. He acquired great knowledge in the research of ancient and mediæval manuscripts as well as in textual criticism and the examination of primary sources. In 1433 he identified the \"Donation of Constantine\" as a fake, confirmed by Lorenzo Valla a few years later, and revealed the forgery of the \"Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals\". He made friends with the Austrian astronomer Georg von Peuerbach and advocated a reform of the Julian calendar and the Easter computus, which, however, was not realized until the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582.\n\nAfter the Archbishop Otto of Trier had died in 1430, Pope Martin V appointed the Speyer bishop Raban of Helmstatt his successor. Nevertheless, the Electorate was contested by opposing parties, and in 1432 Nicholas attended the Council of Basel representing the Cologne dean Ulrich von Manderscheid, one of the claimants, who hoped to prevail against the new Pope Eugene IV. Nicholas stressed the determining influence of the cathedral chapter and its given right to participate in the succession policy, which even places the pope under an obligation to seek a consent. His efforts were to no avail in regard to Ulrich's ambitions; however, Nicholas' pleadings earned him a great reputation as an intermediary and diplomat. While present at the council, he wrote his first work, \"De concordantia catholica\" (\"The Catholic Concordance\"), a synthesis of ideas on church and empire balancing hierarchy with consent. This work remained useful to critics of the papacy long after Nicholas left Basel.\n\nInitially as conciliarist, Nicholas approached to his university friend Cardinal Julian Cesarini, who had tried to reconcile pope and council, combining reform and hierarchic order. Nicholas supported transfer of the council to Italy to meet with the Greeks, who needed aid against the Ottoman Turks. He arbitrated in the conflict with the Hussites. Between the summer of 1437 and early 1438 he was a member of the delegation sent to Constantinople with the pope's approval to bring back the Byzantine emperor and his representatives to the papally summoned Council of Florence of 1439, which was attempting to bring the Eastern Orthodox Church into union with the Western Catholic Church. The reunion achieved at this conference turned out to be very brief. Nicholas would later claim (in the postfaced dedicatory letter of \"On Learned Ignorance\", which Nicholas finished writing on 12 February 1440) that he had chosen to write on this metaphysical topic because of a shipboard experience of divine illumination while on the ship returning from this mission to Constantinople.\n\nAfter a successful career as a papal envoy, he was made a cardinal by Pope Nicholas V in 1448 or 1449. In 1450 he was both named Bishop of Brixen, in Tyrol, and commissioned as a papal legate to the German lands to spread the message of reform. This latter role, his 'Great Legation' of 1450-2, involved travel of almost 3000 miles, preaching, teaching and reforming. He became known as \"the Hercules of the Eugenian cause\". His local councils enacted reforms, many of which were not successful. Pope Nicholas canceled some of Nicholas' decrees, and the effort to discourage pilgrimages to venerate the bleeding hosts of Wilsnack (the so-called Holy Blood of Wilsnack) was unsuccessful. His work as bishop between 1452 and 1458 – trying to impose reforms and reclaim lost diocesan revenues – was opposed by Duke Sigismund of Austria. The duke imprisoned Nicholas in 1460, for which Pope Pius II excommunicated Sigismund and laid an interdict on his lands. Nicholas of Cusa returned to Rome, but was never able to return to his bishopric.\n\nHe died at Todi in Umbria on 11 August 1464. Sigmund's capitulation came a few days after Nicholas's death.\nUpon his death, Cusanus's body was interred in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome, probably near the relic of Peter's chains; but it was later lost. His monument, with a sculpted image of the cardinal, remains. Two other tombstones, one medieval and one modern, also are found in the church. In accordance with his wishes, his heart rests within the chapel altar at the Cusanusstift in Kues. To this charitable institution that he had founded he bequeathed his entire inheritance: it still stands, and serves the purpose Nicholas intended for it, as a home for the aged. The Cusanusstift houses also many of his manuscripts.\n\nNicholas of Cusa was noted for his deeply mystical writings about Christianity, particularly on the possibility of knowing God with the divine human mind — not possible through mere human means — via \"learned ignorance\". Cusanus wrote of the enfolding of creation in God and their unfolding in creation. He was suspected by some of holding pantheistic beliefs, but his writings were never accused of being heretical. Physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein wrote that Nicholas was, to a certain extent, a Pandeist. Nicholas also wrote in \"De coniecturis\" about using conjectures or surmises to rise to better understanding of the truth. The individual might rise above mere reason to the vision of the intellect, but the same person might fall back from such vision.\n\nTheologically, Nicholas anticipated the profound implications of Reformed teaching on the harrowing of Hell (Sermon on Psalm 30:11), followed by Pico della Mirandola, who similarly explained the \"descensus\" in terms of Christ’s agony.\n\nMost of Nicholas of Cusa's mathematical ideas can be found in his essays, \"De Docta Ignorantia\" (\"Of Learned Ignorance\"), \"De Visione Dei\" (\"On the Vision of God\") and \"On Conjectures\". He also wrote on squaring the circle in his mathematical treatises.\n\nFrom the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" (1913 edition):\nThe astronomical views of the cardinal are scattered through his philosophical treatises. They evince complete independence of traditional doctrines, though they are based on symbolism of numbers, on combinations of letters, and on abstract speculations rather than observation. The earth is a star like other stars, is not the centre of the universe, is not at rest, nor are its poles fixed. The celestial bodies are not strictly spherical, nor are their orbits circular. The difference between theory and appearance is explained by relative motion. Had Copernicus been aware of these assertions he would probably have been encouraged by them to publish his own monumental work.\n\nLike Nicole Oresme, Nicholas of Cusa also wrote about the possibility of the plurality of worlds.\n\nNorman Moore, M.D., tells us in The Fitz-Patrick Lectures of 1905:\nIn medicine he introduced an improvement which in an altered form has continued in use to this day. This improvement was the counting of the pulse which up to his time had been felt and discussed in many ways but never counted. ...Nicholas of Cusa proposed to compare the rate of pulses by weighing the quantity of water run out of a water clock while the pulse beat one hundred times. ...The manufacture of watches with second-hands has since given us a simpler method of counting, but the merit of introducing this useful kind of observation into clinical medicine belongs to Nicholas of Cusa.\nIn 1433, Nicholas proposed reform of the Holy Roman Empire and a method to elect Holy Roman Emperors. Although it was not adopted by the Church, his method was essentially the same one known today as the Borda count, which is used in many academic institutions, competitions, and even some political jurisdictions, in original form and a number of variations. His proposal preceded Borda's work by over three centuries.\n\nNicholas' opinions on the Empire, which he hoped to reform and strengthen, were cited against papal claims of temporal power in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Protestant writers were happy to cite a cardinal against Rome's pretensions. Protestants, however, found his writings against the Hussites wrong. Nicholas seemed to Protestants to give the church too much power to interpret Scripture, instead of treating it as self interpreting and self-sufficient for salvation, the principle of sola scriptura.\n\nNicholas' own thought on the church changed with his departure from Basel. He tried arguing that the Basel assembly lacked the consent of the church throughout the world, especially the princes. Then he tried arguing that the church was unfolded from Peter (\"explicatio Petri\"). This allowed him to support the pope without abandoning ideas of reform. Thus he was able to propose to Pius II reform of the church, beginning with the pope himself. Then it was to spread through the Roman curia and outward throughout Christendom.\n\nNicolas of Cusa noted that government was founded on the consent of the governed:\n\nShortly after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, Nicholas wrote \"De pace fidei\", \"On the Peace of Faith\". This visionary work imagined a summit meeting in Heaven of representatives of all nations and religions. Islam and the Hussite movement in Bohemia are represented. The conference agrees that there can be \"una religio in varietate rituum\", a single faith manifested in different rites, as manifested in the eastern and western rites of the Catholic Church. The dialog presupposes the greater accuracy of Christianity but gives respect to other religions. Less irenic but not virulent, is Cusanus' \"Cribratio Alchorani\", \"Sifting the Koran\", a detailed review of the Koran in Latin translation. While the arguments for the superiority of Christianity are still shown in this book, it also credits Judaism and Islam with sharing in the truth at least partially.\n\nCusanus' attitude toward the Jews was not always mild; on 21 September 1451 he ordered that Jews of Arnhem were to wear badges identifying them as such. The \"De pace fidei\" mentions the possibility that the Jews might not embrace the larger union of \"una religio in varietate rituum\", but it dismisses them as politically insignificant. This matches the decrees from Cusanus' legation restricting Jewish activities, restrictions later canceled by Pope Nicholas V.\n\nNicholas was widely read, and his works were published in the sixteenth century in both Paris and Basel. Sixteenth-century French scholars, including Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples and Charles de Bovelles, cited him. Lefèvre even edited the Paris 1514 \"Opera\". Nonetheless, there was no Cusan school, and his works were largely unknown until the nineteenth century, though Giordano Bruno quoted him, while some thinkers, like Gottfried Leibniz, were thought to have been influenced by him. Neo-Kantian scholars began studying Nicholas in the nineteenth century, and new editions were begun by the \"Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften\" in the 1930s and published by Felix Meiner Verlag. In the early twentieth century, he was hailed as the 'first modern thinker', and much debate since then has centered around the question whether he should be seen as essentially a medieval or Renaissance figure. Societies and centers dedicated to Cusanus can be found in Argentina, Japan, Germany, Italy and the United States. His well known quote about the infinity of the universe is found paraphrased in the Central Holy Book of the Thelemites, The Book of the Law, which was \"received\" from the Angel Aiwass by Aleister Crowley in Cairo in April 1904. \" In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found\".\n\nIn The Pursuit of God (1948), A.W. Tozer refers to Nicholas as someone who had a vibrant Christian spirituality, stating in Chapter 7, \"I should like to say more about this old man of God. He is not much known today anywhere among Christian believers, and among current Fundamentalists he is known not at all. I feel that we could gain much from a little acquaintance with men of his spiritual flavor and the school of Christian thought which they represent…\"\n\nNicholas of Cusa wrote a large number of works, which include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30385971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30385971", "title": "Personal life of Clint Eastwood", "text": "Personal life of Clint Eastwood\n\nClint Eastwood has had numerous casual and long-term relationships of varying length and intensity since he was 14 years old. He was first married to Margaret \"Maggie\" Johnson in 1953, but while dating Johnson, he had another relationship that allegedly resulted in a child that the mother gave up for adoption. He had extramarital relationships while married to Johnson, including a 14 year long relationship with actress and stunt woman Roxanne Tunis that produced a daughter. Johnson reportedly tolerated an open marriage with Eastwood. Eastwood and Johnson were divorced and he continued seeing many other women. In 1975, actress Sondra Locke began living with Eastwood. She took the relationship seriously and was extremely distraught when she discovered much later that Eastwood continued to have sexual relationships with other women. When they separated, Locke filed a palimony lawsuit. Eastwood had two children with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves in the 1980s. He married for the second time to news anchor Dina Ruiz in 1996, which lasted until 2013. He has been seen with other women since then.\n\nDuring an interview for the only authorized book ever written about himself, Eastwood told film historian Richard Schickel that he lost his virginity to a neighbor when he was 14 years old. At age 19, Eastwood dated a schoolteacher in her 20s who stalked him and threatened to commit suicide after he broke up with her. Reflecting upon this relationship, Eastwood told \"US Weekly\" in 1987, \"There was just a little misinterpretation about how serious the whole thing was.\"\n\nDuring the summer of 1953, Eastwood met Margaret Neville \"Maggie\" Johnson (1931–), a secretary for auto parts suppliers Industria Americana, on a blind date in Los Angeles. They began dating. During the same summer, Eastwood had a serious relationship in Seattle with a young woman who became pregnant with his child. According to Eastwood biographer Patrick McGilligan, the mother gave the girl up for adoption. Johnson announced her engagement to him in October. Eastwood and Johnson married on December 19, 1953 in Pasadena. \n\nTheir marriage had problems. Schickel wrote, \"He thought they were too young, not well enough established.\" Actress Mamie Van Doren later reported she met Eastwood on the set of \"Star in the Dust\" in the mid-1950s, during which they had an affair. She starred and he played an uncredited bit role. \n\nIn 1959 during the second season of \"Rawhide\", Eastwood began an ongoing affair (reportedly lasting 14 years) with dancer and stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis. She was also married yet separated. Their relationship resulted in Eastwood's earliest legal child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964). Kimber's existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the \"National Enquirer\" revealed her identity. Her birth certificate does list Eastwood as the father, however. \n\nBiographer Marc Eliot wrote that Eastwood's wife Johnson may not have known about the baby at the time. \"It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew about the baby, although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to keep a secret like that when the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood.\" The source for the 1989 \"Enquirer\" article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and even met Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of \"Breezy\" in 1972. Actress Barbara Eden, a onetime \"Rawhide\" guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said Eastwood and Johnson \"...conducted a somewhat open marriage.\"\n\nRia Brown, the biographer of competitive swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him at one point during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene described an affair with Eastwood that started when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's \"Two Mules for Sister Sara\". A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (\"Hang 'Em High\"), Jean Seberg (\"Paint Your Wagon\") and Jo Ann Harris (\"The Beguiled\"), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972).\n\nIn 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke at a meeting in his office on the Universal Studios Lot. The two began living together while filming \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" in Page, Arizona in October 1975, by which time, according to Locke, \"He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie.\" Locke wrote in her autobiography, \"Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd \"never been in love before,\" he confided. He even made up a song about it: \"She made me monogamous.\" That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me.\" \n\nAfter \"Josey\" wrapped, Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because \"psychologically, it would always be Maggie's.\" \"Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer,\" writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper that took three years to renovate. In the interim they shuttled between homes in Tiburon, California and Sun Valley, Idaho, as well as the Rising River Ranch which Eastwood bought from Bing Crosby's estate. Locke had two abortions and then a tubal ligation during the late 1970s. She was quite reluctant to have the second abortion. She later said, \"I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary.\" Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. \"Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house.\"\n\nIn 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 18, 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30 million.\nLocke never divorced her legal husband, sculptor Gordon Anderson, who was gay and resided with his partner in a West Hollywood home purchased by Eastwood.\n\nEastwood and Locke went on to star in \"The Gauntlet\", \"Every Which Way But Loose\", \"Bronco Billy\", \"Any Which Way You Can\" and \"Sudden Impact\". According to former longtime associate Fritz Manes, as quoted by author McGilligan, Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least, but discreetly kept up several \"maintenance relationships\" (such as with Tunis) during that period.\n\nMcGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his \"habitual womanizing\" in the early 1980s, becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose, actress Jamie Rose (who played a bit part in \"Tightrope\"), animal rights activist Jane Brolin (who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s), and Jacelyn Reeves, a Hawaii-based stewardess he met at the Hog's Breath Inn, among others. \n\nHe was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves: son Scott Eastwood (born Scott Reeves; March 21, 1986) and daughter Kathryn Eastwood (born Kathryn Reeves; February 2, 1988). The birth certificates for both children said \"Father declined\", and the affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an exposé article was published in the \"Star\" tabloid in 1990. Reeves reportedly stated, \"Some family members tell me to file a paternity suit against Clint, but I don't want to.\" The children were not reported by mainstream news sources up until the mid-2000s.\n\nEastwood's relationship with Locke (at the time, unaware of his infidelities) ended acrimoniously in April 1989, and the post-breakup litigation dragged on for a decade. Locke filed a palimony lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was at work filming her second directorial feature, \"Impulse\". In court, Eastwood downplayed the intensity of their relationship. He described Locke as a \"roommate\" before quickly redescribing her as a \"part-time roommate.\" Locke's estranged brother told \"The Tennessean\" that Eastwood still truly loved her, but could no longer take her \"addiction\" to husband Gordon Anderson. \n\nAnticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent her marriage to Anderson, Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets which as her legal spouse he was entitled to. \"In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me, Gordon signed away everything without hesitation.\" During the trial, an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood's other family. \"I spoke with the nurse in the delivery room, and she confirmed that they are Clint's children. I'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of Jacelyn, if you want them,\" Locke quotes the informant. \"My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up. For at least the last four years, Clint had been living this double life, going between me and this other woman, and \"having children with her\". Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship, and they weren't mine.\"\n\nAs the case went on, Locke developed breast cancer and said the treatments sapped her will to fight. She dropped her suit in November 1990 in exchange for a settlement package that included a lump sum plus monthly payments from Eastwood and a $1.5 million directing deal at Warner Bros., but sued him again for fraud in 1995 when she became convinced the deal was a sham, finally settling out of court in September 1996. \n\nEastwood was listed as a material witness for Locke's separate pending action against Warner Bros., which alleged that the studio conspired with him to sabotage her directorial career, but in May 1999 that lawsuit too was settled, ending the legal saga. Since then, Locke has made discrediting comments about Eastwood.\n\nImmediately following his split from Locke, Eastwood dated Barbra Streisand. Other female companions during 1989 included Carmel mayor Jean Grace, actress Dani Crayne and model Barbara Minty, widow of Steve McQueen.\n\nIn the autumn of 1990, actress Frances Fisher, whom Eastwood had met on the set of \"Pink Cadillac\" two years prior, moved in with him. Fisher said of dating Eastwood, \"I simply felt that this was it, the big one. I had no idea that every woman he meets probably feels as I did.\" They co-starred in \"Unforgiven\", and had a daughter, Francesca Eastwood (born Francesca Fisher-Eastwood; August 7, 1993). The birth of Francesca was the first time Eastwood was present for one of his children's birth. Also in 1993, according to McGilligan, Eastwood was confronted with the claims of a 39-year-old woman from Kent, Washington who had researched her adoption and ascertained that he was her biological father. Eastwood has never responded to the story.\n\nEastwood and Fisher ended their relationship in January 1995, after which Fisher said it took two years to complete what she called the grieving process for her shattered dreams.\n\nBefore Fisher had moved out of Eastwood's home, he was reportedly already dating Dina Ruiz,a television news anchor 35 years his junior whom he had first met when she interviewed him in April 1993. They married on March 31, 1996, when Eastwood surprised her with a private ceremony at a home on the Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas. The marriage was noted for the fact that it was only Eastwood's second legal union in spite of his many long-term romances over the decades. Eastwood said of his bride, \"I'm proud to make this lady my wife. She's the one I've been waiting for.\" \n\nRuiz commented, \"The fact that I'm only the second woman he has married really touches me.\" The couple has one daughter, Morgan Eastwood (born December 12, 1996). Ruiz made cameos in two of Eastwood's films, \"Blood Work\" and \"True Crime\" (in which Fisher even appeared). In the summer of 2012, Dina, Morgan and Francesca starred with the band Overtone in a reality show for the \"E!\" network titled \"Mrs. Eastwood & Company\", on which Clint appeared only occasionally.\n\nIn August 2013, Dina Eastwood announced that she and her husband had been living separately for an undisclosed length of time. On October 23, 2013, Dina filed for divorce after she withdrew her request for legal separation, citing irreconcilable differences. She asked for full custody of their 16-year-old daughter, Morgan, as well as spousal support. The divorce was finalized on December 22, 2014.\n\nSince his split from Ruiz, Eastwood has been linked publicly with photographer Erica Tomlinson-Fisher (no relation to Frances), 41 years his junior, and restaurant hostess Christina Sandera, 33 years his junior. He and Sandera went public with their relationship at the 87th Academy Awards in February 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "1055660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1055660", "title": "Solomon Grundy (comics)", "text": "Solomon Grundy (comics)\n\nSolomon Grundy is a fictional character, usually depicted as a supervillain in the DC Comics universe and an antihero in the DC animated universe. He was originally depicted as a murder victim brought back to life as a corporeal revenant or zombie, though subsequent versions of the character have occasionally depicted a different origin. Named after the 19th century nursery rhyme, Grundy was introduced as an enemy of Golden Age comic book hero Alan Scott (the original Green Lantern), but has since become a prominent enemy for a number of superheroes such as Superman and Batman. He also has ties to Swamp Thing.\n\nCreated by Alfred Bester, he first appeared in \"All-American Comics\" #61 (October 1944).\n\nGrundy is the focus of one of the four \"Faces of Evil\" one-shots that explore the aftermath of \"Final Crisis\", written by Scott Kolins and Geoff Johns, with art by Shane Davis. It is the introduction to a seven part mini-series featuring the character\n\nIn the late 19th century, a wealthy merchant named Cyrus Gold is murdered and his body is disposed of in Slaughter Swamp, near Gotham City. Fifty years later, the corpse is reanimated as a huge shambling figure (composed partly of the swamp matter that has accumulated around the body over the decades) with almost no memory of its past life. Gold murders two escaped criminals who are hiding out in the marsh and steals their clothes. He shows up in a hobo camp and, when asked about his name, one of the few things he can recall is that he was \"born on a Monday\". One of the men at the camp mentions the nursery rhyme character Solomon Grundy (who was born on a Monday), and Gold adopts the moniker.\n\nStrong, vicious, and nearly mindless, Solomon Grundy falls into a life of crime—or perhaps returns to one, as his scattered residual memories may indicate—attracting the attention of the Green Lantern, Alan Scott. Grundy proves to be a difficult opponent, unkillable (since he is already dead) and with an inherent resistance to Scott's powers (which cannot affect wood, a substance of which Grundy's reassembled body is now largely composed). He apparently kills Green Lantern, who gives off a green flash. Liking this flash, Grundy commits murders hoping to see the flash again. However the first fight ends when, engaging in fisticuffs with the monster because of the ineffectiveness of his ring, Grundy is hurled under a train by Green Lantern.\n\nGrundy is revived when a criminal scientist, known as the Professor, injects Grundy with concentrated chlorophyll. After this second encounter, Grundy is trapped in a green plasma bubble for a time, until a freak weather occurrence releases him from his prison. Making his way across country, Grundy heads for the headquarters of the Justice Society of America. Green Lantern arrives early for the meeting and when the other members arrive, they find their headquarters smashed to pieces and Green Lantern missing from the ranks. Johnny turns on the radio, which blares the warning that Solomon Grundy is on the loose; the members believe, based on a large, muddy footprint on the floor, that Grundy got to HQ and took Green Lantern. The radio continues its report, listing cities where Grundy was seen, so each member picks a city and heads for it (Wonder Woman staying behind) to try to find Green Lantern. The scene now shifts back to the moment at JSA HQ where Green Lantern had opened the door. To his surprise, Doiby Dickles walks in, and informs him that Grundy has freed himself and is on the loose. Green Lantern leaves immediately, hoping to find Grundy before any of the JSA members are hurt going after him. Minutes later, Grundy arrives at JSA HQ, and, not finding the Lantern there, he smashes the place up, then leaves. Green Lantern and Doiby use a special radio-like device Alan Scott had developed that is attuned to the mental wavelengths of Grundy himself; Green Lantern calculates the path of Grundy and announces over the radio in JSA HQ where Grundy will strike. When Green Lantern and Grundy meet, Grundy rips a tree out by its roots and smashes it into the Lantern. Green Lantern fights back with his power ring and fists until both men fall into a nearby stream and over a small waterfall. The Lantern is severely dazed and tries to ward off Grundy with his ring, but he is much too weak. Grundy grabs Green Lantern by the throat and begins to squeeze the life out of him, holding his head underwater. However, Hawkman strikes Grundy with his mace, and Mid-Nite is able to revive the Lantern. A combined attack brings down Grundy, and Green Lantern deposits Grundy on the moon.\n\nA battle soon commences when Grundy's body gravitates towards young astronomer Dick Cashmere as he learns to ride light waves, resulting in his assuming Cashmere's identity for a time while leaving the real one bound and gagged, though the Society finds him soon after. In this incarnation he gains intelligence, which he subsequently loses when Green Lantern defeats and buries Grundy in 1947.\n\nAt this point, he is pulled back to 1941 by the time-traveling criminal Per Degaton, who has enlisted the aid of several supervillains to capture the Justice Society of America on December 7, 1941 (the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor), hoping to change history enabling him to take over the world though he does not want the heroes involved, and tells Grundy he will be able to destroy Green Lantern. However, Degaton is planning to get rid of him once his plan succeeds. He encountered Green Lantern, the Flash, and Wonder Woman in Echo Park. None of the heroes have fought Grundy yet the villain claims to have fought them before. Grundy bests the costumed trio and is summoned by a mysterious voice to deliver them or \"pay the penalty\". The All-Star Squadron comes to their rescue, Sir Justin faces off against Solomon Grundy and Grundy is the last villain to be transported back, he is thrust back to the moon where he remains for over two decades, as this timeline is erased once Degaton is defeated.\n\nGrundy eventually masters the use of stored up emerald energy he has absorbed over the years from his several battles with his arch-foe, and returns to Earth to battle Green Lantern, Hourman, and Doctor Fate. At this point, he has temporary mastery over all wooden objects. He subsequently loses this power over time. He is imprisoned in a bubble in space made by Green Lantern and Doctor Fate.\n\nHe was once pulled to Earth-1 and substituted for the superstrong Blockbuster due to a machine that was accidentally pulling the Earths together in warp-space and substituting people. During this event he had absorbed some of Dr Fate's magic, is stronger than before, and is even able to telekinetically lift the Flash into the air. He hates Green Lantern so much he thinks everyone he sees is Green Lantern. He is imprisoned inside a mountain by Earth-1 Green Lantern after being lifted up by Earth-1 Hawkman and dazed by blows from all the heroes, but when the machine is turned off he is substituted for Blockbuster on Earth-2 and renews the attack, defeating numerous heroes. However the JSA and JLA went to battle an Anti-Matter being that was threatening both Earths in Warp-Space after being summoned by Doctor Fate, who had sensed the threat due to the Spectre. To occupy the villains Green Lantern placed them together to occupy them, as the heroes return they find Grundy and Blockbuster have knocked the hate out of each other. He is then taken back to his Earth by the Justice Society.\n\nHe is briefly a member of the Injustice Society of the World. In the interim, he battles the combined might of both the Justice Society, and later their counterparts the Justice League, nearly to a standstill at Slaughter Swamp, when he develops an affection for a lost alien child who has accidentally been sent to Earth-2 and is dying due to separation from his pet. His magic even enables him to defeat Superman. The alien child is finally reunited with his pet and sent back to his own dimension. Soon after, Grundy crosses over from his Slaughter Swamp prison on Earth-2 to Earth-1 where he encounters that Earth's Superman (see more details below).\n\nGrundy goes on to afflict Green Lantern and his teammates, including the Huntress who is the first female for whom he develops an affection. After Solomon Grundy is rescued from a glacier by Alan Scott's daughter, Jade, Grundy becomes loyal to her and, for a while, is an ally of Infinity, Inc. Eventually, this affectionate relationship turns tragic as the villainous Marcie Cooper, a.k.a. Harlequin of the Dummy's Injustice Unlimited, uses her illusion powers to disguise herself as Jade. Harlequin manipulates Grundy to attack the members of Infinity Inc., one by one. She convinces him to press the unconscious Mister Bones' bare hand against Skyman; since Bones's skin constantly exudes a cyanide-based compound, this quickly leads to Skyman's death. Once Grundy found out that Marcie had duped him, he savagely beat her within an inch of her life. This is the beginning of the end for Infinity Inc., and for Grundy's quasi-heroic career.\n\nThe Earth-One Grundy arises when the Parasite uses an enhanced crystal to metabolically hasten the growth of residual cells left over in the sewers from when the original version had crossed over from Earth-2, which becomes a new, much more bestial version. During a clash with Superman, it is determined that his might is too much for the Man of Steel, so Superman flies the monster to an alien world inhospitable to all save the hardiest life as the zombie propels himself through the air mimicking his one-time adversary.\n\nThis version repeatedly plagues Superman for years until, during an encounter wherein multiple Grundys are spawned, Superman and the Swamp Thing both encounter the clones. Soon, Superman obtains a compound from S.T.A.R. Labs which causes the Grundys to become inert, in effect killing the seemingly unkillable man-thing. Swamp Thing attempts to cry out for Superman to stop, as he believes Grundy to meet the definition of life, but Swamp Thing is unable to express this, due to physical difficulty in speaking. This version of Grundy returns one final time, without explanation, leading a gang in the Earth-One Gotham City. He is apparently destroyed yet again when Batman tricks the creature into a blast furnace, where it is apparently consumed by the flames.\n\nThis version of Grundy was retroactively erased from history after the revamping of Superman in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\".\n\nGrundy and a newly disfigured Harvey Dent striking up an odd friendship after Dent escapes the slaughterhouse to plot his revenge on Carmine Falcone. Grundy also appears early in the story while Batman pursues one of the suspects who bombed Dent's house into the sewers during Thanksgiving. Grundy attacks both of them, but Batman drives him off by blinding him with a shot of mace. Later, as a somewhat humorous twist in The Long Halloween, Batman provides Solomon Grundy with a Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nAfter Infinity, Inc. disbands, Solomon Grundy loses his loyalty towards Jade. A clash with Alan Scott and Jade in the pages of \"Green Lantern Corps Quarterly\" ends with Grundy turning into a statue of petrified wood. The heroes believe the threat of Grundy to have ended once and for all, but they are mistaken. Shortly thereafter, Grundy reappears in Gotham in the pages of \"\", battling Batman once again and killing the female descendant of one of the killers of Cyrus Gold.\n\nGrundy's next major appearance is in \"Starman\", lurking in Opal City's sewers. Jack Knight befriends Grundy, who has become innocent and childlike. Grundy also becomes friends with previous Starman Mikaal Tomas, and dies while sacrificing himself to save Jack Knight from being crushed by a collapsing building. When Grundy appears again, he has returned to his malicious persona; the joint efforts of Jack Knight, Batman, Alan Scott, and The Floronic Man are needed to stop him.\n\nThe origins of Grundy's resurrection come from the fact that the Parliament of Trees, a high council of Plant Elementals, tried to turn him into the newest Plant Elemental. However, the process was missing one vital piece: fire, as a Plant Elemental cannot be fully created unless it died in flames. Since Grundy's death did not involve fire at all, the process is not complete, and he becomes a sort of half-functional Plant Elemental. Grundy has been seemingly destroyed on several occasions, only to rise from the swamp again in a new incarnation. Each version of Grundy has been somewhat different from the last, depending on the medium used to dispatch him (and the drawing style of the current artist. The original Grundy, for example, had prominent front teeth). Some have been truly evil; some much less so. Some versions are more mindless than others; some are actually moderately intelligent, recalling the literate, well-spoken monster of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\".\n\nGrundy hides out for a time in the Arrowcave, the long abandoned former headquarters of the Emerald Archer, Green Arrow. While searching for artifacts of his former life, Oliver and his former ward, Roy \"Arsenal\" Harper, stumble onto Grundy's new hideout. The story, \"Grundy No Like Arrows in the Face!\", is found in \"Green Arrow\" (vol. 3) #18. Green Arrow notes that this version seems much more violent, and manages to kill him by choking him with the string to his broken bow (despite the fact that Grundy does not have a heartbeat, functional veins, or need to breathe). In \"Green Arrow\" (vol. 3) #53, \"Solomon's Revenge\", Green Arrow helps Dr. Chrissie Cavendish, a S.T.A.R. Labs employee, who claims she is the great, great granddaughter of the man the monster spawned from, to find and cure him. Her cure warps her into a monster much worse than Grundy. Green Arrow subdues the new monster, and leaves Grundy be. It is not known if Grundy is still using this building.\n\nIn the first issue of Grant Morrison's \"Seven Soldiers of Victory\", Issue #0 of the same name, one of the Seven Unknown Men of Slaughter Swamp recounts the death of the miserly pedophile, Cyrus Gold, killed at the hands of an enraged mob, but also mentions that Gold could just as easily have been the innocent victim of a misunderstanding, as Slaughter Swamp is a point in space where time means nothing. In the final issue – \"Seven Soldiers #1\" – the same Unknown Man punishes another of his group – the Eighth Man, Zor – by dressing him in Cyrus Gold's clothing and leaving him for the mob to find, implying that Zor – an extremely vain character, notable for attempting several times to overthrow the Universe and for having defeated The Spectre – would later become the first Solomon Grundy.\n\nPrior to \"Infinite Crisis\", Grundy is manipulated by Gorilla Grodd via mind control into attacking Batman and Superman for President Luthor for the bounty of one billion dollars in \"Superman/Batman\". Batman is able to stop Grundy. While no specifics are given, Solomon Grundy is also coerced into joining the Secret Society of Super Villains. He participates in the final strike against the Secret Six. Ragdoll II encounters Grundy in a doorway. Ragdoll's scarred face relates to Grundy, and Grundy goes on to turn against the Secret Society. The aftermath of that battle is inconclusive, but Grundy evidently survives, as he was last seen in a murky swamp in \"JSA Classified\". In it, he is convinced by Icicle to help Wizard, who is in trouble.\n\nAfter helping Icicle free Johnny Sorrow from Prometheus' cosmic key, Grundy stays with the newly formed Injustice Society.\n\nIn \"Infinite Crisis\" #7, Solomon Grundy is seen fighting against the Blood Pack in the Battle of Metropolis, until he is vaporized by Superboy-Prime's heat vision, which apparently kills the Blood Pack and destroys Grundy's current incarnation.\n\nIn Brad Meltzer's \"Justice League of America\", Grundy is reborn with intelligence after being killed in the Battle of Metropolis. He is revealed to be the mastermind behind the abduction of Red Tornado's robot body (it is revealed he gained this intelligence when he was reborn after being burned by Prime). Grundy expresses a desire to stop his cycle of dying and being reborn and so it appears he enlists the help of Professor Ivo to build him an Amazo body to live in forever. The Red Tornado kills Grundy with F5 tornado winds, ripping him apart.\n\nHe later appears in the \"Salvation Run\" mini-series in which he is killed during a battle with Parademons. His body, awaiting its inevitable resurrection, is left behind when the villains leave the Hell Planet. However, when the villains exit, Grundy's hand trembles, accompanied with a groaning sound.\n\nIn the one-shot \"Faces of Evil: Solomon Grundy\" (March 2009) by Geoff Johns and Scott Kolins, Cyrus Gold returns to life in Slaughter Swamp, as he was prior to becoming Grundy. He returns to Gotham City, but is shot by police after attacking a charity worker. In the police morgue, he transforms into Solomon Grundy. Grundy is once more an unintelligent monster, repeating the opening line of the nursery rhyme. A week later, having retreated to the sewers, he has a fight with Killer Croc. At the end of the fight, exhausted, he reverts to Cyrus Gold again. He finds himself in front of his own grave, where the Phantom Stranger tells him he has seven days to undo his curse, as \"There is an unholy night coming, as black as the dead's blood. And it's best if Solomon Grundy was not around for it.\" (A reference to the upcoming \"\" storyline.) Alan Scott serves as his reluctant guide, as the story continues in the \"Solomon Grundy\" miniseries.\n\nIn the count down to Blackest Night, Cyrus Gold was given one week to discover the truth of who murdered him, so he could repent for all of his sins and gain absolution. Alan Scott and the Phantom Stranger were given as his guides throughout the week, while Etrigan was trying to take him to Hell. Gold had a habit of getting killed. No matter how much damage was done to his body, he resurrected as a complete Solomon Grundy, driven to kill. Eventually it is revealed that Gold committed suicide, meaning he forced the curse of Solomon Grundy on himself. At the end of the series' run we see Grundy reanimated as a Black Lantern, and Cyrus Gold in hell. Grundy then tracks down and attacks Bizarro, using a past friendship they had to stir up the creature's emotions. Bizarro eventually manages to defeat Grundy by flying him into the sun, which completely incinerates him, and the black ring.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Grundy is once again a villain for Alan Scott. First appearing in \"Earth 2\" #3, Grundy personifies \"The Grey\" life-destroying forces and opposes \"The Green\" forces that choose Alan Scott as their champion. He attacks Washington DC to get Alan's attention. Flash, Hawkgirl, and Green Lantern fight him, but Atom brings him down temporarily by jumping onto him at giant size. The battle continues until Scott once again exiles Grundy to the moon where neither he nor the \"Grey\" can do any damage.\n\nEventually Grundy's origin was revealed: a slaughterhouse worker in 1898, his wife was raped by his callous foreman, and she killed herself on the job. When the foreman made the workers feed the body to the crocodiles, Grundy snapped, killed his foreman and everyone else in the slaughterhouse, then committed suicide, but apparently something happened immediately afterwards.\n\nThe Prime-Earth Solomon Grundy is introduced in \"DC Rebirth\". His appearance resembles that of his pre-Flashpoint depictions. Solomon Grundy is pursued by Batman and Gotham in Gotham City before the former incapacitates him. Grundy recites the Solomon Grundy nursery rhyme while being pursued before Batman finished it for him when he defeats Grundy.\n\nDuring \"The War of Jokes and Riddles\" arc, Solomon Grundy is among the villains on Joker's side in his war against Riddler.\n\nSolomon Grundy has superhuman strength and stamina. His strength has varied greatly through the years; for instance, in the Long Halloween story arc, Batman beat Grundy, while at various points his strength is roughly on par with Superman's. He is virtually indestructible and immortal thanks to the elemental energy that imbues his form with pseudo-life. He is nearly invulnerable to physical, magical, and energy attacks and he is not affected by fire or low temperatures. He has proven highly resistant to the effects of the original Green Lantern's power ring (which is attributed to his part-plant essence; originally because he had absorbed plant matter from the swamp, and later because he was a partial \"plant elemental\" like Swamp Thing).\n\nGrundy possesses a healing factor. While he has occasionally been destroyed, he has always returned to life sooner or later, though often with different personalities and powers.\n\nWhen it came to \"The New 52\", the Earth-2 Solomon Grundy also possesses powers associated with The Grey.\n\nSolomon Grundy had a counterpart on the Crime Syndicate of America's Earth called Sir Solomon Grundy who was a member of Quizmaster's Justice Underground. Sir Solomon Grundy is a distinguished, poised mountain of a man. During an aerial bombardment of Dover, he is blasted to life out of the rock from the white cliffs. Sir Solomon appears to be identical in physical appearance to the mainstream Solomon Grundy with the exception of a trimmed mustache and a small goatee. In keeping with his educated personality, Sir Solomon dresses himself as a 19th-century Englishman would, and speaks accordingly. His super strength and invulnerability made him a formidable hero, until Ultraman renders him inert on a Saturday.\n\nThe Skulk is a hero of the Amalgam Universe. He is an amalgamation of Solomon Grundy and the Hulk.\n\nBruce Banner was a scientist working with gamma rays. He was testing his gamma bomb out in the desert, but a tall figure walked out into the testing area. When Banner went out see who it was, the man turned out to be Solomon Grundy. The bomb went off fusing Grundy and Banner together. When Banner gets angry, he becomes Grundy. The creature chose a new name calling itself Skulk.\n\nIn Grant Morrison's \"Seven Soldiers\" series, the Witch-People of Limbotown (who are descended from the immortal Melmoth) bury their dead, and later dig them up, at which point they become animate and are used as slave labor. These zombies are called \"Grundies\" or \"Grundymen\", and resemble Solomon Grundy. It has also been established that the Spawn of Frankenstein is partly animated by the immortal blood of Melmoth, making him a Grundyman.\n\nIn Cullen Bunn's \"Sorcerer Kings\" storyline in Superman/Batman, The Creeper leads an army of Grundymen in a battle with Batman, Superman, and vampire Nina Skorzeny.\n\nIn the \"JLA/Avengers\" crossover, Grundy is among the villains enthralled by Krona to defend his stronghold. He is shown being defeated by Thor.\n\nIn the \"Justice Riders\" reality, Solomon Grundy is featured as a normal human. His entire gang was put down by Kid Baltimore with a single bullet each except for Grundy who took two.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Solomon Grundy was invited by Lt. Matthew Shrieve to be the new member of the Creature Commandos, but Solomon Grundy then betrays him, killing his family. It is revealed that Solomon Grundy had been working by General Sam Lane who is responsible for the deaths of Miranda's family.\n\nIn the \"Superman Beyond\" reality, Grundy resurfaces in the future Metropolis as a powerful crime boss known as Mr. Stone operating out of a nightclub called Vanity. He is offered nanotechnology stolen from GNX's Supercop program by Lex Luthor's daughter, Lucinda Luthor.\n\nIn the prequel comic to the video game \"\", Grundy first appears in Year One. As Superman and some of the Justice League fight with Batman over removing the inhabitants of Arkham Asylum, Harley Quinn releases the villains to fight them, including Grundy, who attacks Damian Wayne. He is eventually defeated by Batman and Superman, the former blasting his hands off and the latter ramming himself straight through Grundy's chest since he will reanimate. Grundy reappears in Year Five where he is revealed to be cargo the Regime soldiers are investigating. He brutally beats Hawkgirl until Superman appears, though the situation is rendered confusing as his imperfect clone Bizarro shows up as well. The two combat Grundy and each other until Bizarro leaves and Superman rips Grundy's head off when the zombie prevents him from going after Bizarro. As Grundy will regenerate, Superman takes his body and head to Lex Luthor to find a way to make Grundy an asset to the Regime.\n\nThough Solomon Grundy never appears in \"\"'s prequel comic, seven clones of him appear where they all have been created by Calendar Man and named after the days of the week. Calendar Man used them to help to kill the Batman, which took a whole week for him to defeat all the clones.\n\nIn \"Batman '66\", Solomon Grundy appears as a wealthy Olympic wrestler who Marsha, Queen of Diamonds seduced with one of her Aunt Hilda's potions. Cyrus became loyal to Marsha and she told him to wait outside. She forgot about Cyrus enough where he froze to death during the winter. He is reanimated by Marsha's Aunt Hilda and goes on a rampage in Gotham Cemetery until Batman and Robin stun him with an electric shock to hold him until the police arrive.\n\nDuring the \"Emperor Joker\" storyline where the Joker warped reality, Solomon Grundy was the warden of Arkham Asylum.\n\n\n\n\nSolomon Grundy appears in \"DC Super Hero Girls\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyrus Gold/Solomon Grundy, Arrow, 2013, season 2/episode 9: \"Three Ghosts\"\n\n"}

Henderson Brooks (1909 - 1997) was a senior officer of the Indian Army who is best known for authoring the as yet classified Henderson Brooks-Bhagat Report along with Brigadier Premindra Singh Bhagat (later Lieutenant General). At the time, Henderson Brooks was the commander of XI Corps, based in Jalandhar. The report is an internal operational analysis of the Indian Army following the Indian defeat in the Sino-Indian War of 1962. He was an Anglo-Indian, and a second-generation Indian Army officer.\n\nThomas Bryan Henderson Brooks was born 11 January 1909 in Burma, the son of Captain Thomas Henderson Brooks, Indian Medical Department (1872-1943).\n\nHe attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned a second lieutenant on to the Unattached List for the Indian Army on 29 August 1929.

{"id": "1162701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1162701", "title": "Talia al Ghul", "text": "Talia al Ghul\n\nTalia al Ghul (Arabic: تاليا الغول) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Batman. The character was created by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Bob Brown, and first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #411 (May 1971). Talia is the daughter of the supervillain Ra's al Ghul, the half-sister of Nyssa Raatko, on-and-off romantic interest of the superhero Batman, and the mother of Damian Wayne (the fifth Robin). She has alternately been depicted as an anti-hero.\n\nTalia has appeared in over 500 individual comics issues, and has been featured in various media adaptions. The character was voiced by Helen Slater and Olivia Hussey in the DC Animated Universe, which became her first appearances in media other than comic books. The character was subsequently portrayed by Marion Cotillard in the 2012 film \"The Dark Knight Rises\", and Lexa Doig in the television series \"Arrow\".\n\nThe character was created by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Bob Brown as simply Talia originally. The character's creation and depiction was inspired by other works of fiction, such as the 1969 James Bond film \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", and the Fu Manchu fiction. The character first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #411 (May 1971). She is most commonly depicted as a romantic interest for Batman, a villain, or a combination of the two. Her father, the leader of a worldwide criminal and terrorist empire, considered Batman the man most worthy to marry Talia and become his successor. Absent a spouse, Talia was considered as an heir to her father and his organization. While Batman is uninterested in the criminal empire, he has often demonstrated romantic feelings for Talia.\n\nTalia has saved the life of Batman or helped him on numerous occasions. The majority of her criminal acts have been committed at the behest of her father and motivated by loyalty to her father rather than personal gain. She had been depicted as morally ambiguous or an antiheroic figure. In the mid to late 90's part of her father's name was incorporated to hers as a kind of surname to help readers associate her with Ra's al Ghul. Recent depictions have shown her to be more often an enemy of Batman and a supervillain in her own right, such as leading the League of Assassins, as part of the Secret Society of Super Villains, and as the mastermind behind Leviathan.\n\nIGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Talia as #42. She was ranked 25th in \"Comics Buyer's Guide's\" \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\" list.\n\nThe first Talia comic story appears in \"Into the Den of the Death-Dealers!\" in \"Detective Comics\" #411 (May 1971), written by Dennis O'Neil. In the story, Batman rescues her from Dr. Darrk, apparently the leader of the League of Assassins. It is eventually revealed that the League is just one part of Ra's al Ghul's organization, The Demon, and that Darrk apparently turned against Ra's after failing in a mission (the usual punishment for this is death). At the end of the story, she shoots and kills Darrk to save Batman's life.\nTalia next appears in \"Daughter of the Demon\" in \"Batman\" #232 (June 1971). In the story, Dick Grayson (Robin) is kidnapped. Ra's al Ghul enters the Batcave, revealing to Batman that he knows Batman's secret identity and saying that Talia was also kidnapped along with Dick. Batman then goes with Ra's to search for Dick and Talia; in the end, it is revealed that Talia loves Batman and that the entire kidnapping is a setup designed by Ra's as a final test of Batman's suitability to be Talia's husband and his successor. Though Batman rejects Ra's offer, he nevertheless returns Talia's feelings. Ra's and Talia consider Batman to be married to Talia with only their consent necessary in \"DC Special Series\" #15 (1978) in the story \"I Now Pronounce You Batman and Wife!\".\n\nIn the years since the character met Batman, Talia is repeatedly depicted as torn between loyalty to her father and her love of Batman. However, she has proven an important 'ally' in her way; most prominently, she encourages Batman to return to Gotham City when it is declared a \"No Man's Land\" (1999) following an earthquake, and Batman had lost his fighting spirit and did not believe he \"could\" save Gotham.\n\nIn the graphic novel \"\" (1987) by Mike W. Barr, Ra's al Ghul successfully enlists Batman's aid in defeating a rogue assassin who had murdered his wife and Talia's mother, Melisande. Talia witnessed the murder as a young child. During this story line, Batman marries Talia and the prior marriage from \"DC Special Series\" #15 (1978) is referenced. They have conjugal relations which results in her becoming pregnant. Batman is nearly killed protecting Talia from an attack by the assassin's agents. In retrospect, Talia concludes that she could never keep Batman, as he would be continuously forced to defend her, so she fakes a miscarriage, and the marriage is dissolved.\n\nIn later continuity, after Talia gives birth the child is left at an orphanage. He is adopted and given the name \"Ibn al Xu'ffasch\" which is Arabic for 'son of the bat'. The only other clue to the child's heritage is a jewel-encrusted necklace Batman had given to Talia which Talia leaves with the child.\n\nIt is referenced in three Elseworlds storylines: \"Kingdom Come\", its sequel \"The Kingdom,\" and \"Brotherhood of the Bat\" feature two alternate versions of the child as an adult, coming to terms with his dual heritage.\n\nThe graphic novel \"Batman: Birth of the Demon\" (1992) by Dennis O'Neil explains how her father met her mother at Woodstock and that she was of Arab descent. Talia's mother later dies of a drug overdose in this story.\n\nAfter Bane enters the League of Assassins, Ra's considers Bane a potential heir to his empire instead of Batman and wants his daughter to marry him.Talia later rejects the brute, regarding him as merely a cunning animal compared to the more cultured intelligence of his predecessor. After Batman defeats Bane in the \"\" comic series (1996), Ra's agrees that Bane was unworthy of his daughter (\"Detective Comics\" #701 and \"Robin\" #33), and calls off their engagement. Following \"Legacy\", Bane has a nightmare in \"Batman: Bane\" (1997) of Talia (presumed to be deceased) betraying him and stabbing him and then embracing Batman. In \"Birds of Prey\" #26 (2001), written by Dixon, Bane continues to express his obsession with Talia. At the end of the story, Talia is pleased at the supposed death of Bane in one of her father's underground sanctums.\n\nThe Talia character was written to begin a new phase of her fictional life near the turn of the century. Talia, disillusioned with her father and his plans and using the name Talia Head for herself, leaves him to run LexCorp as its new CEO when Lex Luthor becomes President of the United States. Although she seemingly supports Luthor, she secretly works to undermine him, anonymously leaking news of his underhanded dealings to Superman. In \"Superman/Batman\" #6 (March 2004), when the time comes for Luthor's downfall, she sells all of LexCorp's assets to the Wayne Foundation, leaving Luthor penniless and his crimes exposed to all.\n\nIn \"Batman: Death and the Maidens\" (2003) written by Greg Rucka, it is revealed that Ra's al Ghul met a woman by whom he had a daughter named Nyssa during his travels in Russia in the 18th century. Ra's abandons Nyssa at a crucial time: she is tortured, her entire family is killed in a concentration camp during the Holocaust, and she is rendered sterile when Nazi doctors pour acid into her uterus. Seeking vengeance, Nyssa plans to use her considerable wealth and resources to kill Ra's by befriending, kidnapping, and brainwashing Talia, turning her into a weapon to kill their father. To this end, she captures Talia and kills and resurrects her in rapid succession in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Talia virtually broken from the trauma of dying again and again in so short a time as Nyssa asks Talia why her father is 'letting' this happen to her. Rendered apathetic by her time in the camp, unable to feel anything, Nyssa also plans to assassinate Superman with Kryptonite bullets she stole from the Batcave, hoping that, by uniting the world in one moment of tragedy, she would manage to rouse herself once more.\n\nWhile Batman is successful in preventing the assassination of Superman, he is unable to stop Nyssa from killing Ra's. This, in turn, is actually part of a greater plan concocted by Ra's, who wants to ensure that his daughters would accept their destinies as his heirs and take up his genocidal campaign. Realizing and accepting this, Nyssa and Talia become the heads of The Demon, with Talia disavowing her love for Bruce Wayne as another result of her torture at Nyssa's hands (both sisters then consider Batman to be their enemy). Talia from then on became more often Batman's enemy than an ally.\n\nIn \"Countdown to Infinite Crisis\", it is revealed that Talia is one of the core members of the Secret Society of Super Villains (the others were Lex Luthor (secretly Alexander Luthor, Jr. in disguise), Black Adam, Doctor Psycho, Deathstroke, and Calculator). This is revealed to be part of one of half-sister Nyssa's plans to take over the planet and bring about world peace and equality. After Nyssa is killed by Batgirl Cassandra Cain, Talia assumes leadership of the League.\n\nDuring the \"\" (1988) storyline, Jason Todd, the second Robin, is murdered by the Joker in Ethiopia. He was later revived as a character, and in \"\" (2005), he is discovered by the League of Assassins. In \"Lost Days\", out of her love for Batman, Talia takes Jason to her father and Jason spends months in the care of the League of Assassins. Although his body recuperates, Jason's mind is shattered.\n\nSeeing no other way to help him, Talia takes Jason down to the Lazarus Pit and throws his body in while her father regenerates himself. Jason is fully revived in body and mind. Immediately afterward, in order to spare Jason her father's wrath, she aids the boy's escape.\n\nLivid at the fact that Batman failed to avenge his (Jason's) death by killing the Joker and that Batman had done nothing more than imprison him again, Jason pursues his own brand of justice. In order to stall him from killing Batman, Talia agrees to finance Jason and aid him in his training, so that he can then become the second Red Hood.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, this story was changed, whereby \"Red Hood and the Outlaws\" #2 (2011) shows that, shortly after Jason Todd's return from the dead, Talia al Ghul, out of her love for Batman, takes him to a secret cult of warrior monks called the All Caste to train in becoming a skilled assassin.\n\nThe concept of Talia and Batman having a child from \"Son of the Demon\" is reinterpreted into continuity in the story \"Batman and Son\" (2006), written by Grant Morrison. Their son is grown in an artificial womb and named Damian. He is raised and trained in the League of Assassins. Talia introduces him to Batman as part of a grand scheme involving ninja Man-Bats and the kidnapping of the British Prime Minister's wife. Morrison said he relied on his shaky memories of \"Son of the Demon\" before writing so he \"messed up a lot of the details\" such as Talia drugging Batman before sex. Morrison's mistake was later retconned by then Batman and Robin writer Peter J. Tomasi in the title \"Robin Rises Omega\" where Batman admits that he fell in love and followed his heart.\n\nDuring the \"Batman R.I.P.\" storyline, Talia and Damian become aware of the Black Glove's plot against Batman and begins devising a plan to help save him. They arrive at Wayne Manor just in time to save Commissioner James Gordon from being killed by assorted booby traps created by the Black Glove. This is referenced in issue 39 of the old 52. She offers to join forces with Gordon to save Batman. She and Gordon arrive too late, however, and are informed by Robin that Batman went missing and may be dead following a battle with Doctor Hurt.\n\nFurious that her love may be dead, she sends out her ninja Man-Bats to murder Jezebel Jet, who plays a major role in trying to kill Batman. Soon after it is revealed Batman did not die, but survives only to be captured by Darkseid during the Final Crisis and then apparently murdered by the New God.\n\nFollowing Batman's apparent death, Talia apparently decides to leave Damian in the hands of his adopted brother Dick Grayson, who later takes on the role of Batman, and selects Damian to succeed Tim Drake as Robin.\n\nIn \"Final Crisis\", she is placed on the new Society's inner circle by Libra. Despite Talia's interaction with the new Society she still behaves lovingly and almost devoted to Batman.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Gotham City Sirens\" #2 that Talia has trained Catwoman to resist even the most intense psychological coercion to reveal Bruce Wayne's secret identity.\n\nFollowing an operation in which Damian's spine is replaced, it is revealed that Talia inserts an implant into his spine that allows her or anyone she chooses, including Deathstroke, to control Damian's body remotely. She intends to use this device to force Damian to kill Dick Grayson, whom she perceives as holding her son back from his potential. After Grayson frees Damian, Talia reveals to her son that she has begun cloning him after realizing that the Boy Wonder has completely sided with his father's circle during their confrontation. She is too much of a perfectionist to love her son after he has defied her in such a manner, and is no longer welcome in the House of al Ghul.\n\nIn \"Batman Incorporated\", written by Grant Morrison, Talia is revealed to be the mastermind behind the Leviathan, a shadowy organization formed to oppose Bruce's \"Batman Incorporated\" project. She places a bounty of US$500,000,000 dollars on Damian's head, and declares war on Batman. In \"Batman Incorporated\" Vol. 2, #2 (2012), a Talia origin issue, she puts her father, Ra's al Ghul, under house arrest for opposing her plan and takes his men away with her. She claims to Batman that her agents have infiltrated all of Gotham's infrastructure and that she is providing the poor with purpose by arming them and giving them slogans to chant, as well as an enemy to fight. Talia says Batman must choose between saving Gotham from suicide or saving their son Damian from a death sentence. Her clone of Damian, known as the Heretic, stabs Damian through the chest and delivers the killing stroke to her son, a move that leaves Batman devastated. After the Heretic's final loss against Batman, Talia kills him, destroys Wayne Tower, and challenges Batman to a duel to the death in the Batcave. There, Talia poisons Batman. He embraces and kisses her mid-battle, not knowing that her lips were covered with poison, and he apologizes for not being able to love her the way she wants and admits defeat. Talia asks Batman to beg for the antidote but he does not respond. Jason Todd arrives at the Batcave and offers Talia the Oroboro trigger, a device that would trigger the destruction of seven cities and that she claims would provide a new source of energy for the world. When she attempts to activate the device, Jason reveals that he has double-crossed her and that the weapons the device would trigger had already been disarmed. Talia is then shot and killed by Spyral agent Kathy Kane, buried, and her body later disappears from the grave site along with that of Damian. Morrison's writing of the Batman, Talia, and Damian saga drew from his own personal experience as a child of divorce. The end of \"Batman Incorporated\" marked the end of his seven-year run on the characters.\n\nAfter Batman was preoccupied with a series of cases that would not end, Talia's body is taken from the grave by her father, Ra's, so that he wishes to resurrect his daughter and his grandson, Damian, whose body was taken also. Batman continues his pursuit for Ra's and to reclaim his son's body. Ra's attempted to resurrect Talia alongside Damian in what he thought was a Lazarus Pit in the island of Themyscira, but instead Ra's discovered that it was a portal to a Netherworld in the Pit's former location, of which both Wonder Woman and Batman were already aware. Ra's flees with the bodies afterwards. Batman arrives too late, when Ra's has successfully had the bodies placed in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Batman in dread. The resurrections fail, leaving Ra's to realize his arrogance for allowing the Heretic to kill his grandson, and regret of allowing his daughter, Talia to clone Damian. After defeating Ra's in combat as Batman intends to reclaim his son's body, their battle is intervened by Darkseid's elite member Glorious Godfrey and some Parademons. Batman is forced to team-up with Ra's to battle Godfrey (who was here to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal that once belonged to Darkseid which Ra's has hidden inside Damian's body) and the Parademons had taken the bodies of Talia and Damian. Ra's manages to get his daughter's body from the Parademons in the sky, but falls into the gorge of Nanda Parbat along with Talia's body, while Batman tries to retrieve his son's body from Godfrey. Following Damian's resurrection, Talia had emerged on Nanda Parbat with no memory of who she was. She kills a nearby Tibetan to eat their food.\n\nLater, Talia was approached by a shadowy figure; she is able to recognize the robed figure and feared that faction known as the Lu'un Darga is upon release, she is then knocked unconscious. The robed figure restores Talia's memory and attempts to influence her as a servant, but Talia resists his control and knocks the robed figure with stalagmites. She tries to escape in the Lu'un Darga's unknown lair of the inner core with the heart of the Lazarus Pit. When Talia was reunited with her son in the Lu'un Darga's lair on al Ghul Island, Damian is aware of his quest about the Lu'un Darga, does not desire to see her and attacks. In their battle, Talia unsuccessfully convinces Damian. She explains that Ra's and his al Ghul family wage war against the ancient immortals of the Lu'un Darga claiming to be guardians of the Lazarus Pit. While Ra's sought to bring power and balance of life to Earth, the Lu'un Darga then tried to take back all life and cleanse Earth entirely because they would bring their own destruction to see Earth and the heart of the Lazarus Pit. Talia also tells him he is being used as a pawn of Ra's to steal the Lu'un Darga's power. The mysterious robed figure was revealed to be Den Darga, who thanked Damian's inadvertently for bringing the relic and attempts to bring about the end of life on Earth. While Den Darga destroys al Ghul Island by causing it to sink, he attempts to cleanse Talia and Damian's souls, but the clones of Damian insulate him and sacrifice their lives. Den Darga flees, leaving Talia and Damian to the abyss; they were rescued by Damian's friends. Afterwards, Talia is hopeful to move somewhere to a safe place and tells her conscious son to rest. When Damian is awake, Talia convinced her son to calm down and explains that she had been finding redemption for herself for her retribution against him and inaction after Den Darga's attack. She informs him that if he chooses vigilantism, it will corrupt him of his misdeeds. Talia then tells her son, Damian that he too can either choose between staying or leaving, after approving of who he is, except that his mother has been correcting herself and is regretful of her choices. As he chooses to leave and says goodbye to his mother, Talia regroups with the League of Assassins to prepare for war against Den Darga and the Lu'un Darga.\n\nTalia, along with Batman, show up again later in the title to aid their son in saving all life on Earth from the threat of Den and the Lu'un Darga. They are portrayed as a bickering couple but also put things aside to help. Their mission is a success though Damian ends up giving his life to save humanity. He is later brought back to life by Suren Darga. With the world saved and satisfied her son is safe she goes ahead to rejoin the League of Assassins.\n\nSubsequently in \"DC Rebirth\", Talia al Ghul shows up for her son, Damian Wayne's birthday and warns him of Ra's al Ghul plot to send the Demon's Fist against Damian and the Teen Titans in a plan to assassinate them to prove their worth to the Demon's Head. These targets will later become Damian's Teen Titans teammates after he saves them, kidnaps them and makes them aware of the Fist and their plans.\n\nShe later appears in \"Batman\" #33. Batman and Catwoman come to Khadym to see Holly Robinson, who has been hiding with Talia since fleeing Gotham after killing hundreds of terrorists. Talia initially refuses to allow them to see Holly, going as far as severely wounding Batman and challenging Catwoman to a duel. Selina manages to defeat Talia by wounding her in the same manner that she did Batman beforehand.\n\nTalia has been written to be an athlete at the peak of physical conditioning and has been trained in many forms of martial arts. She was educated in the arts and sciences, and she holds advanced degrees in biology, engineering, and business as an MBA. She is also quite proficient with most hand weapons. Often underestimated, Talia is also an excellent hand-to-hand fighter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He traveled abroad, first to Sweden in 1779. He then went to Bartelshagen, where he became the tutor of the children of Major von Cronhelm. Since the major was fond of mathematics and astronomy, Theodor had to study these himself to be able to teach those subjects. He then married the daughter of the major, Luise Friederike von Cronhelm. Afterwards, he traveled to Tallinn in Estonia, again as a house teacher. He moved on to Haapsalu, teaching mathematics to young noblemen as a preparation for a life as an officer. In 1785 he became an assistant of the Russian Academy of Sciences as a geographer, and by June 1789 he was a full member. In 1803, he became head of the astronomical observatory of the Academy. In 1805, he was a member of the failed Russian expedition to China, together with his son.

The Charlatans' debut single \"Indian Rope\" was successful, and the group subsequently signed to Situation Two, an offshoot of the Beggars Banquet label. In 1990 they released the single \"The Only One I Know\" on the imprint, which charted in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. The band have released twelve studio albums to date.\n\nPrior to the release of the 2004 Charlatans album \"Up at the Lake\", Burgess was living in Los Angeles in the USA, away from the other band members who were still based in England. He explained the band's process during that period in a 2012 interview: \n\"I'm back in London now, but Mark and Tony enjoyed trips out to Los Angeles and we used Los Angeles as a writing tool. I loved the idea of incorporating a city into your music. We used LA quite a lot.\"\n\nBurgess's debut solo album, \"I Believe\", was released in Europe on 3 September 2003 and included the track \"Oh My Corazon\".\n\nBurgess' second solo album \"Oh No I Love You\" was produced by Mark Nevers and recorded at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, US. In 2012, Burgess explained the origin of this album :\n\"The root of this album goes right back to a Kurt Wagner show in Manchester. I carried Kurt's guitar to the car for him. I took the chance to ask him if he would ever consider writing a song with me. He said, \"Sure Tim, you write the music and I'll write the words.\" That one song turned into an album and almost ten years after we first talked about it, the album is ready.\"\n\"Oh No I Love You\" also features collaborations with Factory Floor, R. Stevie Moore and My Morning Jacket, amongst others. The album was later nominated for the Artrocker 'Album of the Year' award in 2012.\n\nBurgess contributed vocals to Saint Etienne's 1993 song \"I Was Born on Christmas Day\", which appeared on the \"Xmas 93\" CD single.\n\nBurgess has twice contributed vocals to tracks by The Chemical Brothers: 1995's \"Life Is Sweet\", taken from their debut album \"Exit Planet Dust\"; and 2005's \"The Boxer\", from their \"Push the Button\" album.\n\nBurgess is a member of The Chavs, together with Carl Barât (The Libertines) and Jamie Reynolds (The Klaxons). In mid-2008, Burgess stated that the band planned to record their debut album in August of that year; however, as of July 2015, an album has yet to emerge. Burgess explained in a 2010 interview: \n\"I think The Chavs have definitely got this mythical thing going on. They have existed and will exist again.\"\nBurgess remixed the Robots in Disguise song \"The Tears\", which was released in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, Burgess curated the Big Top stage at the Isle of Wight Festival, with a line-up that included Killing Joke and The Horrors. Burgess later explained his reason for selecting The Horrors:\n\"I really believed in them from the very first time I met them. It was at the time when their first album was released.\"\n\nBurgess contributed vocals to the song \"You Don't Know This About Me\" by Freebass, the group featuring New Order ex-member Peter Hook and Gary \"Mani (musician)\" Mounfield of The Stone Roses. The song was released in 2010 as part of the band's debut EP \"Two Worlds Collide\".\n\nDuring his time in Los Angeles, Burgess collaborated with Joaquin Phoenix on an album that Phoenix was recording at the time; however, in a 2012 interview, Burgess explained that he had not heard from Phoenix since his return to the UK:\n\"I've not seen him for ages... I don't live in Los Angeles anymore. The time that we spent together was a really great moment. A really great couple of months for me really. He invited me into the recording studio to work on a record and we had a really great time. All relationships with people in bands or actors I've met along the way, you meet them, you're best friends for a minute and you just don't see them at all. If you just remember them as being really great friends and in a way they are. Even if you don't see someone, it's kind of better, 'cos you never get a chance to fall out!\"\n\nOn 15 November 2012, Burgess performed at Manchester Cathedral as part of a \"supergroup\" featuring Mark Collins of The Charlatans, Martin Duffy of Primal Scream, and New Order's Peter Hook. The performance was part of a concert organised to help the city's \"deprived youth.\"\n\nBurgess collaborated with Asia Argento on the song \"Hours / Ours\", which was released on Burgess's own record label O Genesis in 2014.\n\nBurgess collaborated with Peter Gordon to release Same Language Different Worlds on 2 September 2017 through Burgess' own label, O Genesis. The Charlatans frontman originally met New Yorker Peter Gordon in 2012 and they decided then on a music collaboration. Burgess had been a long time fan of Gordon’s work with Arthur Russell and The Love Of Life Orchestra. The album was produced by Gordon in New York and features many of his and Tim’s previous collaborators: Ernie Brooks who played with Arthur Russell on the first Modern Lovers album, trombone player Peter Zummo, conga player Mustafa Ahmed and Nik Void from Factory Floor.\n\nO Genesis is Burgess's own record label, founded in 2011. A compilation CD showcasing the label's artists was released on 10 March 2014, featuring Burgess as a solo artist alongside artists such as Minny Pops, Hatcham Social and Joseph Coward.\n\nIn February 2013, Burgess replaced BBC Radio 6 Music host Lauren Laverne when she and other National Union of Journalists (NUJ) members engaged in strike action against the BBC.\n\nBurgess' autobiography \"Telling Stories\" was published in 2012 by Viking Press. Following the release of the book, Burgess responded to a question about whether he would have changed anything about his career:\nNo, because I would have had to re-write it again! Everything that happened happened because we made a decision at a point in time and at certain ages. I had a relationship with drugs for quite a long time. I'm glad it's over but at the same time I don't regret it. I must have enjoyed it because I did it for so long. It's the same with the relationship with other people. They lasted as long as they did because they were mostly quite good.\nIn 2012, Burgess told \"The Daily Telegraph\" why he practises Transcendental Meditation:\nAt the minimum it de-stresses you. You get thoughts — it's not psychedelic—but things pop into your brain. John Lennon used to stop and write his ideas down; I choose not to. I'm enjoying myself so much I don't want to stop.\n\nBurgess lived in Los Angeles for twelve years, return to the UK in 2013.\n\nIn March 2014, during a BBC Radio 6 interview with Roddy Frame, it was revealed that Burgess is a fan of the music of both Frame and Edwyn Collins, and invited the pair to play at a Manchester café that he owns. Frame stated during the interview that Burgess is \"so positive\" and both will occasionally drink tea together.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2009 it was renamed to 'Tong Tong Fair'. Established in 1959 it is one of the oldest festivals and the fourth largest grand fair in the Netherlands. It is also the annual event with the highest number of paying visitors of the Dutch city of The Hague, having consistently attracted more than 100,000 visitors since 1993.\n\nThe name ‘Pasar Malam Besar’ is derived from the Indonesian/Malay language and literally means ‘Great Night Market’. The new name was chosen to emphasise its link with the 'Tong Tong Foundation' and its cultural mission. Another reason was to distinguish oneself from the many other fairs under the name \"pasar malam\".\n\nEvery summer the fair is raised on its dedicated fairground, called the ‘Malieveld’, close to the central train station of The Hague. 22.000 m² of festival terrain and many, mostly Indo, volunteers will facilitate visitors from both the Netherlands and abroad. The festival hosts three popular food courts, a culinary theatre, many large to medium stages for performance art, workshop areas, areas for lecture and interviews, market areas, as well as specific fair areas for trading merchandise.\n\nIn defiance of government pressure to assimilate into Dutch society, a group of outspoken and independent Indos, organized in the so-called ‘Indies Cultural Circle’, assembled around famous Indo intellectual Tjalie Robinson. One of their accomplishments was the founding of the ‘Pasar Malam Besar’ in 1959. Its continued success in attracting visitors of all generations and presenting a diverse and progressive programme, while preserving the centuries-old cultural ties with the Indonesian Archipelago has gone beyond their expectations. In 2003 HM Queen Beatrix herself officially opened the 45th ‘Pasar Malam Besar’. The royal opening was repeated in 2008 for its 50th edition, which was the last time the name Pasar Malam Besar was used.\n\nSince the Indonesian National Revolution and the expulsion of all Dutch citizens from the Republic of Indonesia, the consequent fall out between the Netherlands and Indonesia has led to a long freeze of political, economical and even academic and cultural relations between the 2 nations. To a degree, this has lasted well into the 21st century. The Tong Tong Fair has always attempted to rekindle and foster those relations and since the 1970s consistently invited Indonesian artisans to the event. It was here that for instance the Royal princesses of Solo, daughters of Pakubuwono XII, performed the exclusive Serimpi dances in 1985. It was the first time in history that members of the Surakarta nobility performed these dances outside the Kraton (Royal Palace) of Solo.\n\nIn 1985 the Tong Tong Fair also organised a benefit to help rebuild the Kraton of Solo, that was damaged by a fire. In 2006 the Tong Tong Fair organised a benefit to help Indonesian victims of the 2004 Tsunami.\n\nTwo specific forms of Indo music usually take center stage. Kroncong (, ) which is an age old music form, with roots in Portuguese Fado music, that developed in Indo communities around Batavia (Now Jakarta). Classic Kroncong orchestras can still be found in both the Netherlands and Indonesia. The other typical music form is called Indorock. It combines flamboyant showmanship and musical virtuoso, based on the American Rock and Roll idiom and has been played by Indo bands ever since the early fifties. With the participation of 3rd and 4th generation Indos, also DJ’s, Hiphoppers and urban live bands are taking their brand of Indo music to the stage at the 'Tong Tong Fair' / ‘Pasar Malam Besar’.\n\nThe multi faceted Indo cuisine (, ) is considered one of the first fusion kitchens in the world and is heavily based on the kitchens of many different Indonesian areas. The classic ‘Rijsttafel’ (a Dutch word meaning `Rice-table’) is a prime example of a Eurasian culinary concept that wasn’t prevalent in pre-colonial Indonesia. The food courts present a wide range of traditional Indonesian and Asian dishes. The culinary theatre allows visitors to share and discuss recipes and make and taste dishes. The market stalls sell fresh Asian fruit such as durian or manggis and snacks such as martabak or pisang goreng. The abundance of food on offer attracts many visitors.\n\nA large section of the ‘Tong Tong Fair’ is reserved for amongst others Indonesian businesses selling their merchandise which includes antiques, Yogya or Bali silver, furniture, batiks, wood carvings and much more. But next to the above-mentioned eye catchers the ‘Tong Tong Fair’ also offers workshops and master classes in the arts and lecture on amongst others literature, architecture and cultural research. Notable also are the comprehensive cultural delegations from specific areas in Indonesia that are invited to participate.\n\nThe Tong Tong Fair, at that time still known as the Pasar Malam Besar, won the Promotion Award of The Hague in December 2006 in the category Tourism and Economy. This was followed in June 2007 by the prestigious Grand Prix of the National Events Awards (the ‘Oscars’ of the Dutch events industry). The Grand Prix is only awarded to events, which in terms of size, standing and allure, have become a real phenomenon. In 2008 the Tong Tong Foundation received the highest award of the city of the Hague (The Stadspenning by the municipality of The Hague).\n\nNotwithstanding the great number of visitors the festival attracts to this day, the greatest challenge facing it is formulating a clear vision for the future and strong strategy towards achieving its cultural mission. As the most important exhibition of Indo culture it will need to transform beyond an event of nostalgia for the Dutch East Indies towards a dynamic catalyst facilitating the evolution of Indo identity and culture. Other modern challenges concern its potential online and multi-lingual role in social media as well as their ability to professionally register the many unique cultural activities and performances hosted.\n\n"}

Mitchell\n\nWilliam John Mitchell (15 December 1944 – 11 June 2010) was an Australian-born author, educator, architect and urban designer, best known for leading the integration of architectural and related design arts practice with computing and other technologies.\n\nMitchell was born on 15 December 1944, in Horsham, Victoria, Australia. He earned an undergraduate degree in 1967 from the University of Melbourne with a major in architecture and was awarded master's degrees from both Yale University (a Master of Environmental Design in environmental design in 1969) and the University of Cambridge (in 1977 with a major in architecture).\n\nMitchell headed the architecture and urban design program at the Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of California, Los Angeles starting in 1970. He was named the G. Ware and Edythe M. Travelstead Professor of Architecture and director of the Master of Design Studies program at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1986 and was named as Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences and Dean of the MIT School of Architecture and Planning in 1992. His 1977 book \"Computer-Aided Architectural Design\" and his 1990 work \"The Logic of Architecture: Design, Computation and Cognition\" were credited by \"The New York Times\" as having \"profoundly changed the way architects approached building design\".\nAt MIT, Mitchell served as an advisor to MIT President Charles Marstiller Vest in guiding a decade-long, five-building expansion project at the university that included designs by Charles Correa, Frank Gehry, Steven Holl, Fumihiko Maki and Kevin Roche, and added one million square feet of classroom, office and other spaces to the MIT campus. The building project became the subject of his 2007 book \"Imagining MIT: Designing a Campus for the 21st Century\", which was written in a single weekend while he was at a Dublin hotel. At the dedication ceremonies for the Frank Gehry-designed Stata Center in 2004, Mitchell said that schools like MIT \"carry a particular responsibility to conceive of architectural projects not just as the rational allocation of resources to achieve quantifiable management goals, but also as inventive, critical contributions to our evolving culture\" and that anything less would be \"a betrayal of their advertised principles\".\n\nStarting in 2003, he created the Smart Cities program within the MIT Media Lab. Projects that Mitchell developed as part of the Smart Cities program included GreenWheel, a device that would add electric power to a bicycle; RoboScooter, a foldable electric scooter; and the MIT Car (also called the \"CityCar\", and developed into the Hiriko), which would be propelled by electric motors built into its wheels. The car and scooter projects were envisioned as being made available for public use at locations in cities, with access and scheduling controlled by computer. The MIT Car was designed to fold up into a more compact shape while parked. Following Mitchell's death, the CityCar Project was continued under the direction of Kent Larson in the Changing Places research group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nMitchell was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was awarded seven honorary degrees. He was a prolific author, writing almost a dozen notable books, plus assorted papers, articles, and speeches.\n\nA resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, Mitchell died due to complications of cancer at age 65 on 11 June 2010. He was survived by his second wife, Jane Wolfson and their son, as well as by a daughter from his first marriage, to Elizabeth Asmis.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "647798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=647798", "title": "Zips", "text": "Zips\n\nZips (also Siggies or Geeps) is a slang term often used as a derogatory slur by Italian American and Sicilian American mobsters in reference to newer immigrant Sicilian and Italian mafiosi. The name is said to have originated from mobsters' inability to understand the faster-speaking Sicilian dialects, which appeared to \"zip\" by. Other theories include pejorative uses such as Sicilians' preference for silent, homemade zip guns. According to still another theory, the term is a contraction of the Sicilian slang term for \"hicks\" or \"primitives.\" The older Sicilian mafiosi of pre-Prohibition known as \"Mustache Petes\" (who eventually were deposed by American-born mobsters during the Castellammarese War) were also referred to as zi\n\nWith increasing violence and government presence in Italy, Sicilians and Neapolitans alike found positions in the growing drug trafficking market of New York City's Five Families. The Pizza Connection, a heroin drug trafficking operation involving Bonanno crime family capo Salvatore Catalano and Sicilian mafioso Gaetano Badalamenti, was largely organized by Zips. The Zips were effective because they were unknown in the country and had no police records. They hung out mainly by themselves in the Knickerbocker Avenue area. \n\nHowever, the younger Sicilian mafiosi became known for their reckless and undisciplined behavior which caused unwanted attention to New York's crime families. The Zips had no qualms about murdering people considered off-limits by the American Mafia, such as police officers, judges, women and children. They were also known for blowing up their targets with bombs; although bombings are common in the Sicilian Mafia, American mafiosi have usually shied away from bombs out of concern that they could put innocent people at risk. Zips have also been known to kill victims even when they are terminally ill; in the Sicilian Mafia, when someone is marked for death, that person cannot be allowed to die of natural causes.\n\nDespite their penchant for recklessness, the group was tolerated as they were able to earn millions for the families, specifically the Bonanno and Gambino families, as both Carmine Galante and Carlo Gambino used zips for narcotics and murder. Galante's two personal bodyguards Cesare Bonventre and Baldo Amato, were Zips.\n\nMany Italian-American mobsters distrusted the Zips, as Bonanno soldier Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero explained in a conversation to undercover FBI agent Joseph \"Donnie Brasco\" Pistone: \"Lots of people hate him [Galante]... There's only a few people he's close to. And that's mainly the Zips... Those guys are always with him. He brought them over from Sicily, and he uses them for different pieces of work and for dealing all that junk [drugs]. They're as mean as he is. You can't trust those bastard Zips. Nobody can. Except the Old Man.\" On another occasion, Ruggiero told Pistone, \"They hate the American people. They hate the American wiseguys.\" Bonanno soldier Anthony Mirra said to Pistone, \"The Zips are clannish and secretive\". They are the meanest killers in the business\".\n\nWith Galante's cooperation, as well as support from Sicilian mafiosi, the Zips' influence and power in New York's underworld grew. Eventually they were able to arrange a working relationship between American and Sicilian mafiosi to begin large-scale drug trafficking operations to distribute heroin into the United States; Sicilian mafiosi would purchase the morphine base in the Middle East, where it would be processed into heroin, before being shipped to New York for distribution. \n\nSupplying support services and specific areas for distribution, New York's crime families collected a percentage of income from drug dealers while keeping themselves distanced from federal prosecution. By the late 1970s, Galante had been bringing in large numbers of Zips for the rapidly growing heroin distribution market (which had been peaking at $10 million a year). Ironically, Galante's Zip bodyguards were party to his murder. Galante was murdered for keeping all the heroin trafficking profits for himself.\n\n\n\n"}
