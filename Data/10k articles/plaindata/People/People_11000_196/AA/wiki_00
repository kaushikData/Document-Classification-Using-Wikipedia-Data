She took her A-levels at Kesteven and Sleaford High School where she played the clarinet. When she was 17, her parents divorced and her father moved to Argyll, Scotland, where he remarried.\n\nTitmuss graduated from City University in St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1998. She did a nursing diploma, because she \"was interested in becoming a doctor, but hadn't taken A level Chemistry\" and became a staff nurse at London's University College Hospital.\n\nTitmuss was hired as a roving reporter on the Channel 4 programme \"Richard & Judy\", in late 2003, and stated at the time that the job was \"an absolute dream come true\". She lost her job in January 2004 following allegations of group sex with her boyfriend John Leslie. A sex tape from four years earlier emerged, in which she had been privately filmed having sex with Leslie and aspiring female model Aisha Abubakar. The footage was downloaded without permission from a private computer and made public by \"conman\" Lanre Onabowale, subsequently convicted to serve 18 years in jail for four counts of rape.\n\nIn the 2004 series of \"Hell's Kitchen\", she trained as a chef. In 2005, Titmuss appeared on Channel 4's \"The Friday Night Project\" as a regular guest, in \"Abi Titmuss: A Modern Day Morality Tale\", a fly-on-the-wall documentary for Channel 4 and on ITV1's \"Celebrity Love Island\".\n\nShe starred on a celebrity edition of Channel 4's \"Come Dine with Me\" with Paul Ross, Lesley Joseph, Linda Lusardi and Rodney Marsh.\n\nTitmuss appeared on the reality series \"Deadline\" with Janet Street Porter on ITV2. The show followed a number of celebrities as they attempted to produce a celebrity-based magazine each week, published as a supplement to \"Closer\". Titmuss was the fourth celebrity to be sacked from the show.\n\nShe has guest-presented shows on Virgin Radio, MTV and LBC radio.\n\nTitmuss took up presenting on pornographic channel Television X, released a fitness video, put her name to an erotic novel published by Black Lace and made personal appearances in nightclubs in the UK and Ireland. An initial offer of a photo shoot over two pages of \"FHM\" morphed into a three-page spread and a cover.\n\nIn December 2004, Titmuss appeared on the front cover of \"FHM\" along with Swedish model Victoria Silvstedt. In 2004 and 2005, she made a total of 38 front-page appearances on British men's magazines, such as \"FHM\", \"Nuts\", \"Zoo Weekly\", \"Loaded\", \"GQ\" and \"Maxim\". She also appeared in the \"Sunday Times Style\" section and in glamour pictures in several tabloid newspapers, including \"The Sun\", \"News of the World\", \"Daily Mirror\", \"The People\" and \"Daily Star\".\n\nIn 2005, Titmuss was ranked seventh by readers in \"FHM\"s list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World. She started writing a regular sex advice column for the magazine the same year. At the height of her fame in 2004/05, Titmuss would be paid a modelling fee of up to £30,000 a day for appearing on the front page of \"Nuts\" or \"Zoo\". In 2005, Titmuss appeared in a high fashion shoot in \"Pop\" magazine, which commented on her status as the \"face of 21st century celebrity\".\n\nIn her memoir, Titmuss states how she quickly realised that she wanted more control after seeing magazines pay her for one shoot and then sell the pictures many times over. Accordingly, she started paying for and directing her own shoots, thus owning the copyright over them and selling them herself, along with her manager.\n\nIn December 2004, Titmuss appeared on the front cover of \"FHM\" again, with Swedish model Victoria Silvstedt, \"marking,\" as she wrote, \"the first time a girl was on the FHM cover twice in one year.\"\n\nAfter taking a break from modelling, Titmuss relaunched her glamour career in 2007, this time as a brunette, with an appearance on the cover of \"Zoo Weekly\" and the sale of the official \"Abi Titmuss Calendar\". On 25 April that year, it was announced that Titmuss had made an appearance for a third time in \"FHM\"'s annual 100 Sexiest Women in the World readers' poll, at number 80. She was ranked number 95 in 2004, and number 7 in 2005.\n\nAfter announcing in late 2007 that she would take a break from her glamour modelling career to concentrate on acting, Titmuss returned with a \"Nuts\" shoot in April 2009 to promote one more calendar.\n\nTitmuss first acted during her university studies and then took part-time acting courses at the Central School of Speech and Drama, paid for from her nursing work. After reducing her glamour model work, Titmuss took a further, short, acting course at the same establishment.\n\nAccording to her memoir, the first theatre producer to audition her for a role was Marc Sinden:\n\nIn March 2006, Titmuss made her London theatre acting début, playing a prostitute with a multiple personality disorder in \"Two Way Mirror\" by Arthur Miller, at the Courtyard Theatre in King's Cross, for which she won a Fringe Report Award for Best West End Début.\n\nIn 2006, Titmuss had a small role in the film \"Goal! 2\" and in 2007 appeared in the second series premiere of \"Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive\", which aired on BBC Three and as a character called Gezebelle in an episode of \"Katy Brand's Big Ass Show\", a sketch comedy series for ITV2.\n\nBetween 26 February and 23 March 2008, Titmuss appeared in the black comedy \"Fat Christ\" at the King's Head Theatre in Islington, London.\n\nShe has been cast in small roles in the British independent films \"Do Elephants Pray?\" and \"Mixed Up\". In 2008, she played the \"Mysterious Girl\" in the Beat 24 Films independent feature film \"Frontman\".\n\nIn 2009, Titmuss was cast in the 25th anniversary production of John Godber's play \"Up 'n' Under\" at the newly refurbished Hull Truck Theatre, Hull. Titmuss played Hazel, the fitness instructor, starring alongside James Crossley (formerly the \"Hunter\" in \"Gladiator\") and soap actor Lewis Linford (\"Lee Naylor\" in \"Emmerdale\"). She also had a part in the BBC TV series \"Hotel Babylon\", playing a nun.\n\nFrom November until December 2009, Titmuss appeared in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", playing the character of Lady Macbeth with the Seagull Rep. The production opened at the Seagull Theatre in Lowestoft before transferring to other East Anglian venues.\n\nOn 18 February 2012, she played the role of Tara Edmonds in an episode of BBC TV's \"Casualty\". She said that landing the part gave her a sense of self-esteem that she had lost doing the glamour work.\n\nIn an article published by The Daily Mail in January 2015, Titmuss announced that she had changed her name to Abigail Evelyn, in the context of her relocation to Hollywood, California and her attempts to establish a new career as an actress.\n\nTitmuss started playing poker \"seriously\" around 2001. In 2008, Titmuss played in the charity, side-event \"Ante Up For Africa\" of the World Series of Poker, in Las Vegas. Ladbrokes Poker started sponsoring her in 2005, when she appeared in the first Ladbrokes Poker European Ladies Championship.\n\nIn 2005, Titmuss produced a book, co-written with Jayne Lockwood, called \"Ten Fantasies\", in which she reveals her \"ten most secret sexual fantasies.\" She stated that she did not want her mother to read it.\n\nOn 24 July 2008, her memoir, titled \"The Secret Diaries of Abigail Titmuss\", on which she collaborated with \"Heat\" journalist Lucie Cave, was published by Headline Review. It is written in the form of a diary and is a day-to-day summary of her life for the past six years. It includes an indepth look into the trial of Titmuss' then boyfriend, John Leslie, at the time when he had been accused of rape, her rise to fame and how she dealt with the tabloids invading her life.\n\nTitmuss first came to public attention as the girlfriend of TV presenter John Leslie whom she met in a Fulham bar on 10 April 1999. In 2017, she married \"Days Of Our Lives\" co-star Ari Welkom.\n\n"}

{"id": "763913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=763913", "title": "Albert Jay Nock", "text": "Albert Jay Nock\n\nAlbert Jay Nock (October 13, 1870 – August 19, 1945) was an American libertarian author, editor first of \"The Freeman\" and then \"The Nation\", educational theorist, Georgist, and social critic of the early and middle 20th century. He was an outspoken opponent of the New Deal, and served as a fundamental inspiration for the modern libertarian and conservative movements, cited as an influence by William F. Buckley Jr. He was one of the first Americans to self-identify as \"libertarian\". His best-known books are \"Memoirs of a Superfluous Man\" and \"Our Enemy, the State\".\n\nThroughout his life, Nock was a deeply private man who shared few of the details of his personal life with his working partners. He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of Emma Sheldon Jay and Joseph Albert Nock, who was both a steelworker and an Episcopal priest. He was raised in Brooklyn, New York. Nock attended St. Stephen's College (now known as Bard College) from 1884 to 1888, where he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.\n\nAfter graduation he had a brief career playing minor league baseball, and then attended a theological seminary and was ordained as an Episcopal priest in 1897. Nock married Agnes Grumbine in 1900 and the couple had two children, Francis and Samuel (both of whom became college professors). In 1909, Nock left the ministry as well as his wife and children, and became a journalist.\n\nIn 1914, Nock joined the staff of \"The Nation\" magazine, which was at the time supportive of liberal capitalism. Nock was an acquaintance of the influential politician and orator William Jennings Bryan, and in 1915 traveled to Europe on a special assignment for Bryan, who was then Secretary of State. Nock also maintained friendships with many of the leading proponents of the Georgist movement, one of whom had been his bishop in the Episcopal Church.\n\nHowever, while Nock was a lifelong admirer of Henry George, he was frequently at odds with other Georgists in the left-leaning movement. Further, Nock was influenced by the anti-collectivist writings of the German sociologist Franz Oppenheimer, whose most famous work, \"Der Staat\", was published in English translation in 1915. In his own writings, Nock would later build on Oppenheimer's claim that the pursuit of human ends can be divided into two forms: the productive or economic means, and the parasitic, political means.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1924, Nock was the co-editor of \"The Freeman\". \"The Freeman\" was initially conceived as a vehicle for the single tax movement. It was financed by the wealthy wife of the magazine's other editor, Francis Neilson, although neither Nock nor Neilson was a dedicated single taxer. Contributors to \"The Freeman\" included: Charles A. Beard, William Henry Chamberlin, Thomas Mann, Lewis Mumford, Bertrand Russell, Lincoln Steffens, Louis Untermeyer, Thorstein Veblen and Suzanne La Follette, the more libertarian cousin of Senator Robert La Follette. Critic H.L. Mencken wrote:\nWhen the unprofitable \"The Freeman\" ceased publication in 1924, Nock became a freelance journalist in New York City and Brussels, Belgium.\n\n\"The Myth of a Guilty Nation,\" which came out in 1922, was Albert Jay Nock's first anti-war book, a cause he backed his entire life as an essential component of a libertarian outlook. The burden of the book is to prove American war propaganda to be false. The purpose of World War I, according to Nock, was not to liberate Europe and the world from German imperialism and threats. If there was a conspiracy, it was by the allied powers to broadcast a public message that was completely contradicted by its own diplomatic cables. Along with that came war propaganda designed to make Germany into a devil nation.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, a small group of wealthy American admirers funded Nock's literary and historical work to enable him to follow his own interests. Shortly thereafter, he published his biography of Thomas Jefferson. When \"Jefferson\" was published in 1928, Mencken praised it as \"the work of a subtle and highly dexterous craftsman\" which cleared \"off the vast mountain of doctrinaire rubbish that has risen above Jefferson's bones and also provides a clear and comprehensive account of the Jeffersonian system,\" and the \"essence of it is that Jefferson divided all mankind into two classes, the producers and the exploiters, and he was for the former first, last and all the time.\" Mencken also thought the book to be accurate, shrewd, well-ordered and charming.\n\nIn his two 1932 books, \"On the Disadvantages of Being Educated and Other Essays\" and \"Theory of Education in the United States\", Nock launched a scathing critique of modern government-run education.\n\nIn his 1936 article \"Isaiah's Job\", which appeared in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" and was reprinted in pamphlet form in July 1962 by The Foundation for Economic Education, Nock expressed his complete disillusionment with the idea of reforming the current system. Believing that it would be impossible to persuade any large portion of the general population of the correct course and opposing any suggestion of a violent revolution, Nock instead argued that libertarians should focus on nurturing what he called \"the Remnant\".\n\nThe Remnant, according to Nock, consisted of a small minority who understood the nature of the state and society, and who would become influential only after the current dangerous course had become thoroughly and obviously untenable, a situation which might not occur until far into the future. Nock's philosophy of the Remnant was influenced by the deep pessimism and elitism that social critic Ralph Adams Cram expressed in a 1932 essay, \"Why We Do Not Behave Like Human Beings\". In his \"Memoirs of a Superfluous Man\", Nock makes no secret that his educators:\n\nIn 1941, Nock published a two-part essay in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" titled \"The Jewish Problem in America\". The article was part of a multi-author series, assembled by the editors in response to recent anti-Semitic unrest in Brooklyn and elsewhere \"in the hope that a free and forthright debate will reduce the pressure, now dangerously high, and leave us with a healthier understanding of the human elements involved.\"\n\nNock's argument was that the Jews were an Oriental people, acceptable to the \"intelligent Occidental\" yet forever strangers to \"the Occidental mass-man.\" Furthermore, the mass-man \"is inclined to be more resentful of the Oriental as a competitor than of another Occidental;\" the American masses are \"the great rope and lamppost artists of the world;\" and in studying Jewish history, \"one is struck with the fact that persecutions never have originated in an upper class movement\". This innate hostility of the masses, he concluded, might be exploited by a scapegoating state to distract from \"any shocks of an economic dislocation that may occur in the years ahead.\" He concluded, \"If I keep up my family's record of longevity, I think it is not impossible that I shall live to see the Nuremberg laws reenacted in this country and enforced with vigor\" and affirmed that the consequences of such a pogrom \"would be as appalling in their extent and magnitude as anything seen since the Middle Ages.\"\n\nThe article was itself declared by some to be anti-Semitic, and Nock was never asked to write another article, effectively ending his career as a social critic. Against charges of anti-Semitism, Nock answered, \"Someone asked me years ago if it were true that I disliked Jews, and I replied that it was certainly true, not at all because they are Jews but because they are folks, and I don't like folks.\"\n\nIn 1943, two years before his death, Nock published his autobiography, \"Memoirs of a Superfluous Man\", the title of which expressed the degree of Nock's disillusionment and alienation from current social trends. After the publication of this autobiography, Nock became the sometime guest of oilman William F. Buckley, Sr., whose son, William F. Buckley, Jr., would later become an influential author and speaker.\n\nNock died of leukemia in 1945, at the Wakefield, Rhode Island home of his longtime friend, Ruth Robinson, the illustrator of his 1934 book, \"A Journey into Rabelais' France\". He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, in Wakefield.\n\nDescribing himself as a philosophical anarchist, Nock called for a radical vision of society free from the influence of the political state. He described the state as that which \"claims and exercises the monopoly of crime\". He opposed centralization, regulation, the income tax, and mandatory education, along with what he saw as the degradation of society. He denounced in equal terms all forms of totalitarianism, including \"Bolshevism... Fascism, Hitlerism, Marxism, [and] Communism\" but also harshly criticized democracy. Instead, Nock argued, \"The practical reason for freedom is that freedom seems to be the only condition under which any kind of substantial moral fiber can be developed. Everything else has been tried, world without end. Going dead against reason and experience, we have tried law, compulsion and authoritarianism of various kinds, and the result is nothing to be proud of.\"\n\nDuring the 1930s, Nock was one of the most consistent critics of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal programs. In \"Our Enemy, the State\", Nock argued that the New Deal was merely a pretext for the federal government to increase its control over society. He was dismayed that the president had gathered unprecedented power in his own hands and called this development an out-and-out coup d'état. Nock criticized those who believed that the new regimentation of the economy was temporary, arguing that it would prove a permanent shift. He believed that the inflationary monetary policy of the Republican administrations of the 1920s was responsible for the onset of the Great Depression and that the New Deal was responsible for perpetuating it.\n\nNock was also a passionate opponent of war, and what he considered the US government's aggressive foreign policy. He believed that war could bring out only the worst in society and argued that it led inevitably to collectivization and militarization and \"fortified a universal faith in violence; it set in motion endless adventures in imperialism, endless nationalist ambitions,\" while, at the same time, costing countless human lives. During the First World War, Nock wrote for \"The Nation\", which was censored by the Wilson administration for opposing the war.\n\nDespite his distaste for communism, Nock harshly criticized the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War following the parliamentary revolution and Bolshevik coup in that country. Before the Second World War, Nock wrote a series of articles deploring what he saw as Roosevelt's gamesmanship and interventionism leading inevitably to US involvement. Nock was one of the few who maintained a principled opposition to the war throughout its course.\n\nDespite becoming considerably more obscure in death than he had been in life, Nock was an important influence on the next generation of laissez-faire capitalist American thinkers, including libertarians such as Murray Rothbard, Frank Chodorov, and Leonard Read, and conservatives such as William F. Buckley, Jr.. Nock's conservative view of society would help inspire the paleoconservative movement in response to the development of neoconservatism during the Cold War. In insisting on the state itself as the root problem, Nock's thought was one of the main precursors to anarcho-capitalism.\n\nWhen Albert Jay Nock started \"The Freeman\" magazine in 1920, \"The Nation\" offered its congratulations to a new voice in liberal journalism. Nock rebuffed the gesture in a letter to the magazine's owner, Oswald Villard, in which he wrote, \"I hate to seem ungrateful, but we haint liberal. We loathes liberalism and loathes it hard,\" identifying himself with Radicalism. Nock professed allegiance to a detached philosophical objectivity, expressed in his Platonist credo of \"seeing things as they are\". He had decried anti-Semitism in his earlier writings, but in his sixties he began giving vent to increasingly anti-Semitic and anti-democratic sentiments, leading Robert Sherrill, writing years later in \"The Nation\", to call him \"virulently anti-Semitic\" and \"anti-democratic\".\n\nThe historian and biographer, Michael Wreszin, compared Nock's disillusionment with democracy and his attacks on the Jewish people to similar feelings held by Henry Adams. Before he died, Nock destroyed all his notes and papers, except a few letters and an autobiographical manuscript published posthumously as \"Journal of Forgotten Days\" (Nock was so secretive about the details of his personal life that \"Who's Who\" could not find out his birthdate).\n\nIn \"Journal of Forgotten Days\", Nock wrote these passages about the Jews of New York City:\n\nNock took a jaundiced view of American politics and American democracy itself, and asserted that in all his life he voted in only one presidential election, in which he cast a write-in vote for Jefferson Davis.\n\nIn \"Memoirs of a Superfluous Man\" (1943), Nock had this to say about mass democracy in America:\n\nThe author Clifton Fadiman, reviewing \"Memoirs of a Superfluous Man\", wrote: \"I have not since the days of the early Mencken read a more eloquently written blast against democracy or enjoyed more fully a display of crusted prejudice. Mr. Nock is a highly civilized man who does not like our civilization and will have no part of it.\" Nock's biographer Michael Wreszin wrote concerning Nock's reaction to the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932: \"Sailing to Brussels in February 1933, before Roosevelt's inauguration in March, he repeated in a journal his appreciation of Catherine Wilson's observation that the skyline of New York was the finest sight in America when viewed from the deck of an outbound steamer.\"\n\nIn the fictional \"The Probability Broach\" by L. Neil Smith, as part of the North American Confederacy Series, in which the United States becomes a Libertarian state after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrow and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason in 1794, Albert Jay Nock serves as the 18th President of the North American Confederacy from 1912 to 1928.\n\n\nMiscellany\n\nPublished posthumously:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58615256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58615256", "title": "Andrei Evseev", "text": "Andrei Evseev\n\nAndrei Nikolaevich Evseev (born 1955 in Khotkovo, Sergiyevo-Posadsky District, RSFSR - 1979 in Moscow), known as the \"Tagaransky Maniac\", was a Soviet serial killer who operated in Moscow and the Moscow Oblast in the mid-1970s.\n\nEvseev was born in 1955. He left school after the 7th grade, and worked as a model, laboratory assistant and sailor, but always quit because he didn't like to work. In the early 1970s, Evseev was placed in a psychiatric clinic. As he later told:The first victim of the maniac was a 16-year-old schoolgirl named Marina Morozova, who was dressed in red clothes. The murder was committed by Evseev in the city of Zagorsk (now Sergiyev Posad) on August 25, 1974. The following day, Evseev killed 66-year-old chef Gennady Kuzmin, stabbing him with a knife several times near the Odintsovo railway station, then robbed the corpse and threw him into a roadside ditch. Evseev stole money and a grocery order that was scarce in Soviet times - a broiler chicken and three kilograms of Bulgarian peaches. On suspicion of committing these crimes in the Kemerovo Oblast, 19-year-old Sergei Savelyev, who deserted on the eve of the first murder from the military unit, was arrested, but he failed to prove his involvement, despite the fact that he confessed to the murder of Morozova.\n\nIn September 1974, in Moscow, in the park of the Palace of Culture named after the Third International, Evseev attacked student Vladimir Parshin, inflicting 4 knife wounds on him, but he survived. On September 24, 1974, in Moscow, in a house near the Dobryninskaya metro station, Evseev made a robbery attack on Anna Astafyeva. Despite being on the verge of life and death, she was able to describe the killer; according to her, the killer was a young man with sideburns and kind eyes. Soon after, the woman died in hospital.\n\nOn September 26, at the 43rd kilometer station in the Moscow Oblast, Evseev attacked a man and seriously injured him. When attacking, the maniac broke his knife and the blade was left stuck in the victim's back, who died later in hospital. The murdered man, who looked very similar to Evseev, was 42-year-old Nikolai Dyomin, who had spent almost 20 years in prison. As it later turned out, Evseev committed the murder with the aim of confusing the tracks by putting his clothes on the man. Initially, the investigators even thought it was Dyomin who committed all the robberies and murders.\n\nOn October 8, 1974, in the Tagansky District of Moscow, Evseev made 3 robbery attacks at once. Two of the three women robbed by him died from the knife wounds, and all of them wore red dresses. Panic began in Moscow, with people saying that the \"Killer of women in red\" had appeared. On October 15, in the area of the Akademicheskaya metro station, at intervals of 20 minutes, Evseev committed 2 more attacks on girls, one of them dying from the wounds received. On October 16, in the area of the Proletarskaya metro station, Evseev again made a double attack, killing one of the victims. But this time both victims were not wearing red clothes (thus, the version that the maniac who hunted for women in red was not confirmed).\n\nAfter this, Evseev committed a series of robberies in Moscow and the surrounding region, but all victims survived and described the killer the same way. In connection with the panic in Moscow, the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR decided on unprecedented measures, the Minister of Internal Affairs Nikolai Shchelokov spoke on television, warning the citizens to be cautious. This frightened Evseev, who stopped his attacks for almost 2 years.\n\nIn November 1976, Evseev committed 4 robberies in a month, 2 of which ended in murder. In the fall of 1977, Evseev hit the secretary-typist of the Central Committee of the CPSU Nina Dalinjan on the head with a screwdriver, but she miraculously survived. The apotheosis of the criminal activity of the maniac was the brutal murder of Lydia Kupriyanova, the wife of famous Soviet artist Mikhail Kupriyanov. This time, for the first time, the maniac raped the victim posthumously. Two months later, on December 19, 1977, in front of dozens of people in the backyard of the \"Housewares\" store in the village of Sofrino, he committed another murder. He took the watch, money, jewelry and a dog collar from the murdered Lydia Schur, raping her corpse afterwards.\n\nA witness to the last murder reported that he had seen a suspicious man in a corduroy jacket at the crime scene. The local drinking company said that with them appeared a certain Shahnov, dressed in the velvet jacket. The jacket, on which there were blood stains and a knife was in one of the pockets, was later found. However, when Shahnov was arrested, he reported that another man had given him that jacket, with subsequent examination confirming the man's testimony. Another witness said that he had seen a stranger on a train in Khotkovo, and that he was wearing a railwayman's uniform. When the database was picked up and according to it were selected suitable matches, 22-year-old criminal Andrei Evseev came up as a result.\n\nOn December 28, 1977 the maniac was arrested. On this day he had dressed the New Years tree with jewels stolen from the victims. When they came for him, he hid the jewels, and there was nothing suspicious in Evseev's apartment, except for the dog collar stolen from the last victim. He explained that he kept it hidden as a memory of his beloved dog. At first he refused to give evidence, but on December 31, on New Year's Eve, while conversing with a cellmate, he dropped a strange phrase: \"My mother, I suppose, already baked pies with jewels.\" The cellmate turned out to be an informant, and the investigators guessed that the stolen jewelry was hidden in a bag of flour. The conjecture was confirmed during the second search of Evseev's apartment.\n\nAt the interrogations, Evseev was defiant and refused to communicate with the female investigator. He agreed to testify only after he was brought salted herring, which he ate entirely with bones. Subsequently, he confessed to 9 murders, 18 attempted murders, one rape and 32 robberies.\n\nThe forensic psychiatric examination recognized Evseev as sane, but at the same time called him a \"sociopath\". While waiting for the court, Evseev watched for himself, and did exercises every morning. The maniac felt no remorse for his deeds, claiming that he despised those who work and live \"from salary to salary.\"\n\nIn 1979, the court sentenced Andrei Evseev to death, and he was soon executed by firing squad.\n\n\n\n"}

At the age of 7 he accepted Christ at a revival meeting. He studied at Mississippi College and Golden Gate Baptist Seminary but abandoned his studies to serve as pastor in several Baptist churches across the US.\n\nIn the late 1960s Blessitt began evangelizing to the youth of Hollywood, California. There he became known as the \"Minister of Sunset Strip.\" Blessitt preached to hippies, Hells Angels, runaways, drug addicts, teen prostitutes, flower children, would-be actors, and rock stars. In March 1968, he opened a coffee house called \"His Place\" in a rented building next door to a topless go-go club. It was there that he first made a big cross to hang on the wall of the building on the inside. He started carrying the cross on Sunset Strip from time to time.\n\nHis first marriage was to Sherry Anne Simmons, whom he married within three weeks of dating. Together they had six children: Gina, Joel, Joy, Joshua, Joseph and Jerusalem. All his sons are named Arthur, and go by their middle names.\n\nIn 1990 he married Denise. They have adopted one child, Sophia. As of the late 2000s, he lives in Denver, Colorado.\n\nArthur made the cross in 1968 to hang on the wall of 'His Place' on Sunset Strip, Hollywood. He made short cross-walks there. Then on Christmas morning in 1969, Blessitt began his journey with the cross, walking from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. He later said he heard the voice of Jesus calling him to walk to every nation. For a short while, he set up an evangelical outreach on New York's Times Square, which was similar to his Hollywood coffeehouse. In August 1971, Blessitt made his first overseas cross-walk beginning in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe has carried the cross to all parts of the world including war-torn countries such as Lebanon and the world to share Jesus. During the Cold War, Blessitt carried his cross into the Soviet Union, through Russia, the Baltic States, Ukraine and other countries. He has carried the cross through such places as Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, China, South Africa, Lebanon, India, Antarctica, Palestine, Israel, Cuba, Libya, Northern and Southern Yemen, Vietnam and Mongolia.\n\nDuring his walk around the world, Blessitt has held audience with numerous world and religious leaders including, George W. Bush, Billy Graham, Pope John Paul II, Yasser Arafat and Muammar al-Gaddafi and was arrested 24 times. \n\nOn part of the cross-walk through Beirut, Blessitt chose to bring his son Joshua.\n\nHe completed every nation and major island group on June 7, 2008 but is still walking on.\n\nAs of 2018 he is still carrying the cross in the U.S. and other nations. This is the 50th year of Arthur carrying the cross (1968-2018). Over 42,279 miles (68,042km) through 324 countries (including Island Groups and Territories), of which 54 were in open war. This is about 84.5 million steps and about 19 billion pounds carried. He has crossed every ocean and walked on all seven continents (including Antarctica). He is known internationally as the \"Pilgrim with the Cross.\" He is in the Guinness World Records Book 2015 on page 155 with a photo and story for Longest Around the World Ongoing Pilgrimage/Walk. His latest film documentary in 2014 is \"The Cross Museum of Arthur and Denise Blessitt\"; \"Arthur a Pilgrim\"(1988), was his first documentary feature.\n\nBlessitt is the subject of a 2009 documentary feature, \"The Cross: The Arthur Blessitt Story\", directed by Matthew Crouch.\n\nHe made a failed bid for the 1976 Democratic nomination for President.

Rubenstein founded the band with guitarist Paul Bakija when both were in Forest Hills High School in Forest Hills, Queens. The band played the punk clubs of Manhattan while the members were still in high school.\n\nAs the Reagan Youth members attended Forest Hills High School, the band performed regularly at CBGB's and other venues on the United States' budding punk rock circuit. They never recorded a single, only some self-published tapes and an album that was turned into a seven-song EP. That EP sold more than 40,000 copies. The band also appeared on several compilations albums, including \"Live at CBGB's\". They toured cross-country twice, in 1984 and 1987, sharing bills with punk bands such as Dead Kennedys, U.S. Chaos, Agnostic Front, Bad Brains and Beastie Boys. They were a mainstay at CBGB's Sunday matinee concerts and performed at Rock Against Racism concerts in the early 1980s.\n\nReagan Youth was a left-wing anti-racist band, often using Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Party imagery as political satire. In their original 1980s incarnation, they sought to address the parallels between the policies of president Ronald Reagan, the Christian Right and American conservatives and the beliefs of hate groups. Their eponymous song, \"Reagan Youth\", uses a tongue-in-cheek rhetoric to draw parallels between Young Republicans and the Hitler Youth. The fact that Rubinstein's parents were Holocaust survivors added to the urgency of the band's message.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the Reagan Youth members were frustrated and worn out from years of touring, drug use and not making money in the music industry. When Reagan left office, the band officially disbanded. Rubinstein and several other band members continued to play music together, such as in the band House of God, which never achieved the same success as Reagan Youth.\n\nBy the time Reagan Youth broke up, Rubinstein had developed a serious heroin addiction and was dealing drugs. During a drug deal, another drug dealer beat up Rubinstein with a baseball bat, leaving him in a coma. .\" While admitted at the hospital Rubinstein received a lobotomy to relieve brain trauma and save his life. When he got out of the hospital, he returned to his parents' home. There, Rubinstein continued to use drugs, smoking marijuana in his bedroom as his parents tried to help him recover. Eventually Rubinstein left his parents' home and moved back to the Lower East Side. By then, between the assault and his continued drug use, he was no longer as energetic, and had become dishevelled. Many of his friends from the punk scene no longer associated with him.\n\nRubinstein began dating Tiffany Bresciani, a prostitute who worked on Houston Street and danced in strip clubs around the city. He had told his parents that she was a dancer. Bresciani financially supported the couple and their drug habit with prostitution. Rubinstein would often wait for Bresciani while she serviced a customer, and then accompanied her to buy drugs. Around this time, Rubinstein's mother died in a car accident.\n\nOn June 24, 1993, Rubinstein and Bresciani were waiting on Allen Street when a familiar customer pulled up in a Mazda pickup truck. Tiffany got in, telling Rubinstein that she would return in 20 minutes. She never came back. Rubinstein called the police with a description of the truck and went to the club where Tiffany danced and all the hospital emergency rooms in the city, searching for Tiffany. A few days later, on June 28, two New York state troopers were patrolling Long Island's Southern State Parkway when they pulled over the truck after a high-speed chase, finding Bresciani's decaying body in the back. They arrested the driver, Joel Rifkin, one of Long Island's most infamous serial killers, who was later linked to killing numerous prostitutes.\n\nDepressed and alone after the unexpected loss of his girlfriend and mother, Rubinstein headed into a downward spiral, and less than a week after Bresciani's murder, on July 3, 1993, he committed suicide by a drug overdose.\n\n"}

She was taught to fly by the notable pioneer aviator Wiley Post. She was a stunt pilot. In 1972 she became one of the Chickasaw Nation's first community health representatives; her mother was an original enrollee of the Chickasaw Nation. Scott was elected to the Chickasaw legislature in 1983 and served three terms there.\n\nPearl was born to George and Lucy Carter on December 9, 1915 in Marlow, Stephens County, Oklahoma. She was the youngest of three girls, and also had a younger brother named George Carter, Jr. Her father was a wealthy businessman, while Lucy was an original enrollee of the Chickasaw Nation. Pearl evidently eschewed many of the traditional activities of young Chickasaw women. Instead, she acquired her own automobile when she was only eleven years old, and had learned to drive herself by the age of twelve. Pearl said late in her life that her father was blind, and that she had served as his eyes, so she accompanied him everywhere, whether in his office or collecting rents out on the farms. She also said that she spent her whole childhood talking with adults.\n\nNoted pioneer aviator Wiley Post was a friend of the Carter family and visited their home from time to time. One of his visits occurred in 1928, when Pearl was twelve years old. He gave Pearl and her father their first ride in an airplane. She was totally enthralled by the experience, later saying:\n\"I knew right then, while I was in the air with Wiley that first day, that I would fly someday. I asked him a hundred questions while we were up in the air, and as soon as he set(\"sic\") the plane down, I ran over and told Daddy that I wanted to learn to fly.\"\nPost agreed to teach Pearl how to fly. After several months of lessons, her father surprised her with her own Curtis Robbins airplane. On September 12, 1929, she took off on her first solo flight, becoming the youngest person in Oklahoma at that time to accomplish this feat. Not long afterward, she began to perform as a stunt pilot.\n\nIn 1931, Post flew into the local airstrip with another man, whom Pearl did not recognize. Moments later Post introduced her to the already world famous Will Rogers.\n\nPearl married at age 16, and quickly started a family of her own. She continued to fly after her first baby, but after she bore a second, she realized that the babies would have to grow up without a mother if there were an accident. She abruptly quit flying. She apparently relented once, when Wiley Post allowed her to take to the air flying his famous \"Winnie Mae,\" in which he had set two world records.\n\nIn 1972, Pearl began her \"second career\" as an active worker for the Chickasaw Nation. After studying at the Desert Willow Indian Training Center in Tucson, Arizona, she became one of the tribe's first community health representatives. In 1983, she was elected to the Chickasaw Legislature, where she served three terms.\n\nShe was inducted into the Chickasaw Nation Hall of Fame, the International Women's Air & Space Museum Hall of Fame, and the Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame, and is a charter member of the National Museum of the American Indian at the Smithsonian. All her flying experience is included in the \"History of Aviation Collection on Women\" at Texas University in Dallas. She is also listed in the 1978-79 edition of \"Personalities of the South\", the 1989-90 edition of \"Outstanding Women of America\", and in the Chickasaw Historical Section of the Memphis Magazine.

{"id": "2241583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2241583", "title": "Informationist", "text": "Informationist\n\nAn Informationist (or Information Specialist in Context) provides research and knowledge management services in the context of clinical care or biomedical research. \nAlthough there is no one educational pathway or formalized set of skills or knowledge for informationists, one way to think of the informationist is as one who possesses the knowledge and skill of a medical librarian with extensive research specialization and some formal clinical or public health education that goes beyond on-the-job osmosis.\nMedical librarians and other biomedical professional organizations have been exploring the possibilities for evaluating how informationists are being used and whether their activities supplement or replace medical library activity.\n\nMore generally, an Informationist is a professional who works with information within a particular business, analytic or scientific context to drive toward outcomes based on evidence, analysis, prediction and execution. For example, an extension of the term is increasingly emerging in financial services, life sciences and health care industries. Though still nascently in use, its adoption applies to individuals with extensive industry expertise, acute familiarity with organizational structures and processes, deep domain level information mastery and information systems technical savvy. Informationists in this context support transformational initiatives within and across functional areas of an enterprise as architects, governance experts, continuous improvement advocates and strategists.\n\nThe term was proposed in 2000 by Davidoff & Florance. Their editorial suggested that physicians should be delegating their information needs to informationists, just as they currently order CT scans from radiologists or cardiac catheterizations from cardiologists. They conceived of an information professional who was embedded in (and indeed, supported by) the clinical departments.\n\nSupporters of the concept see it as a means for librarians to reinvigorate connections with the faculty/clinicians, as well as provide superior service by dint of informationists' biomedical training. Critics complained that the idea is nothing new (perhaps most famously in an article entitled \"So what are we? Chopped liver?\"); librarians already provide indepth, high quality information services and clinical medical librarians have been working alongside physicians, nurses and other clinicians for years.\n\nLarge informationist programs in the U.S. exist at the National Institutes of Health and at Vanderbilt University. Welch Medical Library at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is developing an informationist service model in which its 10 clinical and public health librarians are moving from serving as liaison librarians for assigned departments toward becoming embedded informationists within their departments.\n\nTo prepare for the embedded informationist role, librarians are undertaking education as needed to supplement their backgrounds. For example, librarians bring experience in clinical behavior counseling, public health, nursing, and more. Informationist training can then focus upon filling gaps in research methods knowledge more so than on gaining additional knowledge in the librarian's area of expertise. Courses, seminars and workshops being undertaken include those covering systematic reviews, evidence-based medicine, critical appraisal, medical language, anatomy and physiology, biostatistics, and clinical research.\n\nThe term informationist is related to that of informatician – also informaticist – and many informationists do possess skills in clinical topics, bioinformatics, and biomedical informatics. Harvard University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Washington University in St. Louis are examples of institutional libraries which have hired PhD-level scientists (who may or may not have library degrees) to provide informatics support for biomedical research.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nGrefsheim SF, Whitmore SC, Rapp BA, Rankin JA, Robison RR, Canto CC.

The district stretches from the state capital, Columbia, to the Georgia-South Carolina border. From 1985 to 2001, he served in the South Carolina Senate. He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nHe is a member of the House Republican Policy Committee and is an Assistant Republican Whip.\n\nIn September 2009, Wilson received international attention when he interrupted a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama to the joint session of Congress by shouting \"You lie!\". The incident resulted in a reprimand by the House of Representatives.\n\nWilson was re-elected in 2010 by 9 percentage points over his closest challenger and when he ran unopposed in the 2012 general election he was re-elected with 96% of the vote. Wilson won re-election in 2014 with more than 62% of the vote in a three-way race.\n\nWilson was born in Charleston, South Carolina, the son of Wray (née Graves) and Hugh deVeaux Wilson. Wilson obtained a bachelor's degree in political science from Washington and Lee University in 1969 where he joined Sigma Nu, and obtained his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1972. From 1972 to 1975, Wilson served in the United States Army Reserve, and then as a Staff Judge Advocate in the South Carolina Army National Guard assigned to the 218th Mechanized Infantry Brigade until retiring from military service as a colonel in 2003.\n\nAs a real estate attorney, Wilson co-accounted (with Derek Vinyard) the law firm Kirkland, Wilson, Moore, Taylor & Thomas in West Columbia, where he practiced for over 25 years. Wilson was also a municipal judge in Springdale, South Carolina.\n\nWilson was active in South Carolina Republican politics when the party barely existed in the state. He took part in his first Republican campaign in 1962, when he was 15 years old. He served as an aide to Senator Strom Thurmond and to his district's Congressman, Floyd Spence.\n\nIn 1981 and 1982, during the first term of the Reagan Administration, Wilson served as deputy general counsel for former Governor Jim Edwards at the U.S. Department of Energy. Wilson is also a graduate of Morton Blackwell's Leadership Institute in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nWilson was elected to the South Carolina Senate in 1984 as a Republican from Lexington County. He was re-elected four times, the last three times unopposed; Lexington County is one of the most Republican counties in the state. He never missed a regular legislative session in 17 years. After the Republicans gained control of the chamber in 1996, he became the first Republican to serve as Chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. Wilson was a member of the Columbia College Board of Visitors and Coker College Board of Trustees.\n\nDuring his tenure in the South Carolina Senate, Wilson was the primary sponsor of bills which included the following: establishing a National Guard license plate, providing paid leave for state employees to perform disaster relief services, and requiring men aged 18–26 to register for the Selective Service System when applying for a driver's license. In 2000, Wilson was one of seven senators who voted against removing the Confederate battle flag from being displayed over the state house.\n\n As of the 113th Congress, Wilson serves on three standing committees and various subcommittees overseeing specific areas of legislation. Wilson serves on the Committee on Armed Services and is Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel; he also serves on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. He serves on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, for which he also is a member of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions. As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Wilson serves on the Subcommittee on Europe and Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia. Wilson is a member of the Republican Study Committee and the Tea Party Caucus.\n\n\nLike his former boss, Spence, Wilson is an ardent social and fiscal conservative, and a strong supporter of the military. He is a member of the Republican Study Committee.\n\nIn 2003, Wilson voted for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, including its Section 1011 authorizing $250,000 annually of taxpayer money to reimburse hospitals for treatment of illegal immigrants. In 2009, Wilson changed to his current position opposing public funds for healthcare of illegal immigrants.\n\nWilson has sponsored and co-sponsored a number of bills, concerning teacher recruitment and retention, college campus fire safety, National Guard troop levels, arming airline pilots, tax credits for adoptions, tax credits for living organ donors, and state defense forces.\n\nAs of January 2006, eight bills co-sponsored by Wilson have passed the House, including H.R. 1973, the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005, making safe water and sanitation an objective of U.S. assistance to developing countries.\n\nWilson is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he co-sponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.\n\nHe has cited as one of his proudest congressional achievements the Drafting Business Expensing Act of 2003, which allows businesses to immediately write-off fifty percent of the cost of business equipment and machinery. This bonus depreciation provision has been extended for 2008 and 2009 in two separate stimulus bills. In addition, Wilson spearheaded the Drafting Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act of 2003, which offers higher education loan forgiveness to math, science and special education teachers in schools with a predominantly low income student population. He cites as his most important vote the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.\n\nOn September 9, 2009, Wilson shouted at President Barack Obama while Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to outline his proposal for reforming health care. During his address, Obama said: \"There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false – the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.\" In a breach of decorum, Wilson pointed at Obama and shouted, \"You lie!\" twice. Wilson attracted national and international attention for the incident. He said afterwards that his outburst reflected his view that the bill would provide government-subsidized benefits to illegal immigrants.\n\nThen-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel immediately approached senior Republican lawmakers and asked them to identify the heckler and urge him to apologize immediately. Members of Congress from both parties condemned the outburst. \"Totally disrespectful\", said Senator John McCain (R-Arizona) of Wilson's utterance. \"No place for it in that setting or any other and he should apologize immediately.\" Wilson said later in a statement:\n\nThis evening I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the President's remarks regarding the coverage of undocumented immigrants in the health care bill. While I disagree with the President's statement, my comments were inappropriate and regrettable. I extend sincere apologies to the President for this lack of civility.\n\nObama later accepted Wilson's apology. \"I'm a big believer that we all make mistakes\", he said. \"He apologized quickly and without equivocation and I'm appreciative of that.\"\nHouse Democrats called on Wilson to issue a formal apology on the House floor. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn who led the resolution said \"This is about the rules of the House\", while House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said \"What's at issue here is of importance to the House and of importance to the country ... This House cannot stay silent\". Wilson refused to make an apology in the House, saying in a televised interview that, \"I believe one apology is sufficient.\" Congressional Republicans agreed, and opposed further action, with Minority Leader John Boehner saying \"I think this is a sad day for the House of Representatives ... I think this is a political stunt aimed at distracting the American people from what they really care about, which is health care.\" On September 15, the House approved a \"resolution of disapproval\" against Wilson, on 240–179 vote.\n\nSeveral fact-checking organizations wrote that Wilson's views were inaccurate because HR 3200 expressly excludes undocumented aliens from receiving government-subsidized \"affordability credits\". However, the non-partisan Congressional Research Service agreed that people would need to be lawfully present in the U.S. in order to be eligible for the credits, but noted that the bill did not bar non-citizens from buying their own health insurance coverage through the health insurance exchange. The Obama administration said that, in the final bill, undocumented immigrants would not be able to participate in the Exchange.\n\nSuch language was included in the Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill, America's Healthy Future Act.\n\nIn contrast to the criticism, many others strongly supported his actions, distrusting that the bill would actually exclude illegal aliens in practice, which allowed Wilson to receive substantial political contributions and gain much notoriety.\n\nFollowing the incident, both Wilson and Rob Miller, his subsequent 2010 general election opponent, experienced a significant upswing in campaign donations. In the week after Wilson's outburst, Miller raised $1.6 million, about three times his 2008 campaign, while Wilson raised $1.8 million. By September 30, 2009, Wilson had out-paced Miller's fundraising by $2.65 million to $1.69 million respectively. This fundraising surge led to Wilson writing fundraising letters for the Republican Party of Virginia and the National Republican Congressional Committee. Political observers described him as a \"GOP fundraising star.\"\n\nOn a 2002 live broadcast of the C-SPAN talk show \"Washington Journal\", guests Wilson and Democratic congressman Bob Filner were discussing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. When Filner noted that the US provided Iraq with \"chemical and biological weapons\" in the 1980s, Wilson stated that this idea was \"made up\" and commented to Filner, \"This hatred of America by some people is just outrageous. And you need to get over that.\" Wilson apologized for his remarks in statements to the press.\n\nIn 2003, Essie Mae Washington-Williams revealed she was the daughter of Wilson's former employer, the late Senator Strom Thurmond, and Thurmond's black maid. Wilson was among those who publicly doubted her assertion that Thurmond had a child out of wedlock. Wilson said even if her story was true, she should not have revealed it because \"it's a smear\" on Thurmond's image and was a way to \"diminish\" Thurmond's legacy. After Thurmond's family acknowledged the truth of Washington-Williams' revelation, Wilson apologized, but said that he still thought that she should not have revealed that Thurmond was her father.\n\nIn November 2009, the \"New York Times\" reported that Representatives Wilson and Blaine Luetkemeyer made identical written statements, saying that \"One of the reasons I have long supported the U.S. biotechnology industry is that it is a homegrown success story that has been an engine of job creation in this country. Unfortunately, many of the largest companies that would seek to enter the biosimilar market have made their money by outsourcing their research to foreign countries like India.\" The statement was originally drafted by lobbyists for Genentech, now a Swiss biotechnology firm, but founded, and still headquartered in San Francisco, California.\n\nWilson supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying that the order would \"secure our borders and keep American families safe from terrorist attacks.\"\n\nOn April 10, 2017, a Wilson town hall meeting at Aiken Technical College in Graniteville, South Carolina was interrupted by activists chanting \"you lie\" as the Congressman asserted that the Affordable Care Act was causing people to be denied health services.\n\nIn 2018, a segment with Wilson aired as part of Sacha Baron Cohen's Showtime series, \"Who is America?\". Wilson endorses \"Kinderguardians,\" a phony program to teach and arm schoolchildren as young as 3 to protect themselves in the classroom. Advocating for toddler carry, he states on camera \"A 3-year-old cannot defend itself from an assault rifle by throwing a Hello Kitty pencil case at it\".\n\nWilson was elected in 2001 in a special election caused by the death of Floyd Spence, his former boss. Wilson once said that a dying Spence called him from his hospital bed and asked him to run.\n\nIn a crowded five-way Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—Wilson tallied 75 percent of the vote, more than enough to win the nomination outright. He prevailed in the December 18 special election with 73 percent of the vote.\n\nWilson won election to a full term in 2002 with 84 percent of the vote, facing four minor-party candidates. He received 144,149 votes to 17,189 and 9,650 minor party candidates with 371 write-in votes.\n\nWilson was mentioned as a possible candidate for retiring Senator Fritz Hollings' seat in 2004, but he decided to run for a second full term and beat his opponents, Democrat Michael Ellisor and Constitution Party nominee Steve Lefemine, with 65 percent of the vote. Wilson got 181,862 votes to 93,249 for Democrat Ellisor, and 4,447 for minor party candidate Lefemine, with 312 write-ins.\n\nIn the 2006 elections, he defeated Ellisor again, gaining 62.7 percent of the vote, and kept his House seat.\n\nWilson won re-election in November 2008, defeating the Democratic nominee, Iraq War veteran Rob Miller, 54% to 46%. It was the closest race in the district in 20 years, and the closest race that Wilson had ever faced in 24 years as an elected official. He only survived by winning his native Lexington County by 33,000 votes, more than the overall margin of 26,000 votes.\n\nChallenged by Democratic nominee Rob Miller, Libertarian nominee Eddie McCain, and Constitution Party nominee Marc Beaman, Wilson won re-election on November 2, 2010, defeating Miller 53% to 44%.\n\nRedistricting made the 2nd somewhat more compact. It lost Beaufort and Hilton Head Island. To make up for the loss in population, it absorbed all of Aiken County and a slice of Orangeburg County.\n\nIn the November 2012 general election, Wilson ran unopposed and was re-elected with 96% of the vote.\n\nChallenged by Democratic nominee Phil Black, and Labor Party nominee Harold Geddings III, Wilson won re-election on November 4, 2014, defeating Black 62% to 35%.\n\nChallenged by Democratic nominee Arik Bjorn, and American Party nominee Eddie McCain, Wilson won re-election on November 8, 2016, defeating Bjorn 62% to 35%.\n\nChallenged by Democratic nominee Sean Carrigan and American Party candidate Sonny Narang, Wilson won re-election on November 2, 2016, defeating Carrigan 56.3% to 42.5%.\n\nWrite-in and minor candidate notes: In 2000, write-ins received 71 votes. In 2001, write-ins received 1 vote. In 2002, write-ins received 371 votes.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Floyd Spence died in office, causing the 2001 special election to be held. Wilson served the remainder of the term.\n\nAn Associate Reformed Presbyterian, Wilson and his wife, Roxanne Dusenbury McCrory Wilson, have four sons and six grandchildren. All four sons are Eagle Scouts.\n\nIn a 2005 guest article on Rediff.com, Wilson stated that his father, Hugh, was a member of the Flying Tigers in World War II. The Wilson family attends First Presbyterian Church in Columbia.\n\nWilson has been a member and former President or Chairman of the Cayce-West Columbia Rotary Club, Sheriff's Department Law Enforcement Advisory Council, Reserve Officers Association, Lexington County Historical Society, County Community and Resource Development Committee, American Heart Association, Mid-Carolina Mental Health Association, and NationsBank Lexington Advisory Board.\n\nWilson has also been a member of the Columbia World Affairs Council, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Woodmen of the World, Sons of Confederate Veterans, American Legislative Exchange Council, Navy League, AMVETS, Association of the US Army, National Guard Association, Air Force Association, American Legion and Boy Scouts of America.\n\n\n"}

Bunel was a representative of the Haitian Revolutionary Government, who negotiated the first trade agreement between his nation and the United States, in 1799.\n\nBorn in France, he became a merchant and plantation manager in Cap-Français, Saint-Domingue (now Cap-Haïtien, Haiti). Although white and a slave-holder, his wife, Marie Fanchette Estève, was a free-black Creole, and he was sympathetic to the 1791 Haitian Revolution through which the former-colony won its independence from France. He served as a diplomatic and trade envoy for Governor Toussaint Louverture, a self-educated former slave. He did the same for Louverture's successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines.\n\nHe played an important administrative role in Louverture's regime, drafting trade and non-aggression agreements between Saint-Domingue and the United States and Great Britain. Louverture trusted Bunel enough to make him the country's Paymaster General.\n\nIn July 1798, the United States rescinded its treaties with France, beginning two years of low-level conflict known as the Quasi-War. L'Ouverture saw this breach as an opportunity.\n\nIn early-December 1798, Bunel came to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then the capital of the United States, to try to end the American trade embargo against Saint-Domingue. He met and dined with Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, and was invited to meet President John Adams. In early-January 1799, he dined with Adams. \n\nDebate in Congress over \"Toussaint's Clause\" focused on the consequences of legitimizing a revolutionary government run by former-slaves, and how American slave-holders would be endangered by interaction between their slaves and Saint-Dominguans. Pennsylvania Congressman Albert Gallatin appealed to racial prejudice in his notorious \"Black Speech\" (January 21, 1799), using Bunel (who had brought his wife with him) as an example of miscegenation taking place in Philadelphia: \"The General [L'Ouverture] is black, and his agent here is married to a black woman in this city.\" \n\nCongress passed \"Toussaint's Clause,\" and the Bunels returned to Saint-Domingue in mid-February. \n\nThe United States did not officially recognize the Haitian Revolutionary Government, but the trade agreement was announced by a June 26, 1799 presidential proclamation: U.S. Proclamation Regarding Commerce with St. Domingo (1799). \n\nFollowing Jefferson's 1800 election as president, American support for Saint-Domingue diminished.\n\nArticle 3 of L'Ouverture's 1801 Haitian Constitution stated: \"Slaves cannot exist on this territory; servitude is abolished forever. All men are born, live and die free and French.\" But, as the threat from Napoleon Bonaparte loomed, this provision seems to have been ignored:\n\n\"Like the early rulers of Haiti who followed him, Toussaint was willing to participate in a one-way version of the slave trade in order to increase his workforce and his army. Bunel was dispatched to Jamaica to purchase ten thousand slaves from the English ... By the terms of Article 3, such arrivals would have to be freed as soon as they reached the colony, but the cloudy language about 'engagements' suggests that some form of indentured servitude was being contemplated.\"\n\nBonaparte's brother-in-law, General Charles Leclerc, invaded Saint-Domingue in 1802. Bunel's wife was imprisoned, and he was forced to pay what was essentially a ransom. Leclerc captured and imprisoned L'Ouverture, and deported him to France, where he died in 1803. Bunel was also deported to France. \n\nBunel returned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1803, where he became a major exporter of contraband goods to Saint-Domingue. He returned to Haiti during the reign of Dessalines. He, and later his wife, eventually settled permanently in Haiti.\n\n\n"}

For much of the 1960s she was a regular performer on \"Bandstand\", a pop music TV show, hosted by Brian Henderson. Stone's top 20 singles on the national charts are \"I'll Step Down\" (No. 19, February 1962), \"4,003,221 Tears from Now\" (April 1964), \"Born a Woman\" (No. 3, September 1966) and \"Would You Lay with Me\" (No. 2, June 1974). On the Queen's Birthday Honours List of June 2006, Stone was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia, with the citation, \"For service to the community as an entertainer at fundraising events for a range of charitable organisations, and as a singer.\"\n\nStone grew up in the Sydney suburb of Granville. She has two younger sisters, Joyce and Janice. From a young age she sang country music at home and her parents bought her a guitar, which she learned to play. \n\nIn her early teens Stone entered and won a local talent contest and was noticed by an attendee, Reg Lindsay. By November 1956 she had joined his touring performance troupe, the Reg Lindsay Show, and stayed for 18 months. In July 1957 a reviewer of Lindsay's show in Cabramatta for \"The Biz\" wrote that \"Little Judy Stone, of Granville, was very pleasing in her turn.\"\n\nStone hired Kevin Jacobsen as her talent agent. She described meeting him, \"I used to sing, with a heavy guitar, Western style numbers. Once I met Kevin he gave me one instruction: 'Throw that guitar out the window.' Although I did not throw it out any window, I am now singing without any of my own musical accompaniment.\" Jacobsen's older brother, Col Joye, was an established pop singer and regular performer on \"Bandstand\", a TV music show. Stone supported his group, Joye and the Joy Boys, on their tours of South Australia, Victoria and Queensland. Stone, as a young performer, had been billed as \"The Cowgirl from Granville\" but on her first appearance on \"Bandstand\" she was mistakenly announced as \"The Callgirl from Granville\". By May 1961 she had also appeared on other TV music shows, \"Teen Time\" and \"Six O'Clock Rock\".\n\nJacobsen had Stone signed with Festival Records and in June 1961 she issued her debut single, \"You're Driving Me Mad\" – a cover version of the 1958 song by United States singer, Jo Ann Campbell. For the track she was backed by the Joy Boys. In August she relocated to Melbourne, for three months, to appear on Graham Kennedy's \"In Melbourne Tonight\" variety TV show. She expected that \"While in Melbourne most of my shows will be adult performances, which will be a change from the present teenagers' shows.\" Her third single, \"I'll Step Down\", was released in February 1962 and became a top 10 hit in Sydney and top 20 in Brisbane. \"The Biz\" correspondent compared it to her earlier single, \"Although very different to 'You're Driving Me Mad', this still possesses the inimitable style of this great little local star.\" Also in that year Stone issued her debut album, \"I'll Step Down\", on Festival.\n\nIn 1963 she recorded \"It Takes a Lot (To Make Me Cry)\" on which the Bee Gees (Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb) sing backup vocals; it was released as a single in July. Her seventh single, \"4,003,221 Tears from Now\", was released in April 1964. It is a cover version of the 1963 single by US singer Kerri Downs (aka Mary Lou Kiernan). According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, it \"became Stone's most popular release of the 1960s. The heart-wrenching ballad... [which] peaked at #8 in Sydney and #7 in Melbourne.\"\n\nAside from her solo releases, Stone was often teamed with Col Joye in duets for singles, extended plays and albums. McFarlane found their work \"contained cutesy material like 'Young and Healthy', 'Angry' and 'Side by Side'.\" In early 1965 Stone with Col Joye and the Joy Boys undertook a tour of Japan for two months. In September 1966 she covered \"Born a Woman\" by US singer, Sandy Posey. It was a top 10 hit in Sydney.\n\nFrom the late 1960s and into the early 1970s Stone \"consolidated on her early pop successes with regular appearances on the club and country music circuits.\" Later singles included, \"Mare Mare Mare\" (January 1974), \"Would You Lay with Me (In a Field of Stone)\" (No. 2, June 1974), \"Silver Wings and Golden Rings\" (February 1975) and \"Hasta Mañana\" (May 1976).\n\nIn January 1992 Stone was diagnosed with throat cancer, which was removed by surgery.\n\nIn 2007 Stone performed a duet with Scottish singer-songwriter Isla Grant on the track \"What's a Girl to Do?\" for Grant's album, \"Down Memory Lane\".\n\nOn 25 February 1966, Stone married fellow musician, Leo de Kroo. The de Kroo brothers, Leo and Doug, were a duo who also appeared on \"Bandstand\" and other pop music shows. The marriage ended in divorce five years later, Stone reflected, \"I blamed myself when it ended, then I realized something its taken a long time to learn – singing is my life... I don't have a social life – there simply isn't time – but I don't get lonely; I have my family.\"\n\nIn January 1992 Stone was diagnosed with throat cancer, at the same time as her fellow \"Bandstand\" regular, Peter Allen. Both Stone and Allen were operated on the same day by the same surgeon. In June Stone was still in recovery when she learned of Allen's death, she recalled that after the operation \"He came into my room to see me because he was going back to the States and I just wanted to give him a big hug — he looked so ill.\"\n\nOn the Queen's Birthday Honours List of June 2006, Stone was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia, with the citation, \"For service to the community as an entertainer at fundraising events for a range of charitable organisations, and as a singer.\" In January 2014 she was made Australia Day Ambassador for regional celebrations in Laurieton, Wauchope and Port Macquarie.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In fact, there are no known gunfights involving Cooley. The one confirmed fact is that he was one of the suspects in the death of Johnny Ringo. Cooley was reputedly one of the few men who did not fear Ringo, or anyone else, and had the skills necessary to survive a confrontation with him. At least that is the legend as it is told. But in reality, few feared Johnny Ringo. Though he had a fearsome temper, Ringo never killed anyone aside from unarmed men, a fact since confirmed by historians. Cooley was alleged to have been good with a gun, and this came from reliable sources, however there is nothing to indicate he ever actually put those skills to work.\n\nIt was suggested that a posse led by Wyatt Earp located Ringo, who spotted them and grabbed his guns to run for a canyon. Cooley shot him as he ran with a rifle. Another theory was that Cooley killed him one on one. Neither version can be proven. It is confirmed that he supported the Earp faction, but he has never been mentioned as having taken active part in the Earp Vendetta Ride. He is believed to have helped fund the ride, and he is believed to have been employed as a stage coach driver for Wells Fargo at the time.\n\nAlthough his personal exploits have no written proof, Cooley was a friend to Wyatt Earp, as well as Doc Holliday. Cooley was also a close friend of Virgil Earp. It is widely known that Lou Cooley sided against the \"Cowboys\" with Virgil Earp at a time when the confrontation between the Earps and Clantons reached a boiling point, but there are no documented accounts of him having any clashes with any of the Clanton clan, or the \"Cowboys\". He did have a reputation of being fast with a gun, and an excellent shot. Morgan Earp, another friend of Cooley's, reported that he could shoot a silver dollar out of a person's hand before they could slap their hands together.\n\nIt has been suggested that it was Lou Cooley that shot and killedIke Clantonin Mexico, and he supposedly did so to end more backshooting from the cowboys against the Earps—at that point both Morgan and Virgil had been ambushed. However, that was a complete fabrication, since Ike Clanton's death was a well documented event, with him having been killed by Detective Jonas V. Brighton in Springerville, Arizona. In fact, there are no documented facts confirming Cooley having ever been involved in any gunfight.\n\nCooley has at times been confused with lawman/outlaw Scott Cooley, but the two are not the same. Lou Cooley disappeared from public view after the end of the Earp-Clanton fighting, and evidently resumed a normal life. It is recorded that he died in Oak Hill, Tennessee at the age of 93 and is buried outside of Nashville. His family still resides there today.\n\n"}

This form of painting has a very old tradition, associated with the East Javanese kingdom of Majapahit, which flourished in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and helped to propagate Hindu faith across the region – now largely retained in Bali. It was from the Kamasan village where artists were traditionally recruited to produce classical-style paintings on cloth (or bark cloth) for religious and ceremonial use as well as to decorate the palaces and temples.\n\nMangku Muriati is a daughter of Mangku Mura (1920-1999), who is considered one of the prominent artists of his generation in Kamasan-style painting [1].\n\nAs was common practice in artist families, Muriati used to help her father in colouring paintings from an early age, learning the craft of painting. She studied art at the Udayana University in Denpasar, Bali, but after graduating, returned to the traditional style of painting. Working as a Kamasan artist, she joined a small number of Balinese women who work in this style, customarily dominated by men.\n\nIn the 1990s, at the age of 32, Muriati became a priestess at her local clan temple in the ward of Banjar Siku. She considers painting and priestly duties as complementary, comparing the role of an artist to a dhalang or puppeteer, who needs an extensive knowledge of characters and stories, ultimately derived from what is considered the sacred scripture - the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The subjects of her paintings and related commentaries frequently refer to social and political issues in contemporary Bali.

{"id": "11236613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11236613", "title": "Mehmet Niyazi", "text": "Mehmet Niyazi\n\nMehmet Niyazi Cemali (; January or February 1878 - November 20, 1931) was an Ottoman-born Romanian and Crimean Tatar poet, journalist, schoolteacher, academic, and activist for ethnic Tatar causes. Present for part of his life in the Russian Empire and Crimea-proper, he wrote most of his works in Crimean Tatar and Ottoman Turkish. Niyazi is credited with having played a major part in keeping alive the connection between the Crimean Tatar diaspora and their land of origin, and is best known for his lyrical works depicting Crimea (\"The Green Island\" and \"The Green Homeland\").\n\nBorn into a Muslim family of Crimean refugees in the village of Aşçılar, Northern Dobruja, he was the second son of Ismail and Azize, two literate peasants and Ottoman subjects. Niyazi's birth coincided with the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, which ended in the region's annexation by the Kingdom of Romania. He familiarized himself with Tatar literature and folklore during his childhood, and was taught Ottoman Turkish by his father, before completing his primary education in Aşçılar. It was probably during his teenage years that he first began authoring his series of literary pieces, which, overall, were noted for their reliance on elements of the Ottoman vocabulary.\n\nIn 1889, the family left Romania for the Ottoman capital of Istanbul, where Mehmet was enrolled in normal school. In subsequent years, he became influenced by the creations of Namık Kemal and Abdullah Hamit, as well as achieving fluency in French, Arabic and Persian. In 1898 and 1899, he attempted to settle in Russian-ruled Crimea and start a career as a schoolteacher, but was expelled by the government on both occasions.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1904, Niyazi returned to Romania and joined the Tatar community in Constanţa. He married Sefika Abdulakim (also known as Sapiye); she was the sister of Kázím Abdulakim (a Romanian Army officer and World War I hero) and of the politician Selim Abdulakim. The couple had four daughters and two sons (two of their children died in their teens).\n\nNiyazi was appointed a teacher at the local Tatar school in 1906, lecturing in Ottoman History, Ottoman Language, Poetry and Prose, Persian Literature, and \"Kalam\". He served as the institution's headmaster between 1910 and 1914, settling with his family in Medgidia after 1916, when he was appointed headmaster of the Islamic Seminary in that town. In 1909, he began editing the journal \"Dobruca\", which was printed in Istanbul by the Kader publishing house. Other short-lived publications he started during the period include \"Tesvik\", \"Mektep ve Aile\", and, with Cevdet Kemal, \"Isik\".\n\nIn early 1918, when the Qurultay proclaimed a Crimean People's Republic in the wake of the October Revolution and upon the close of World War I, Niyazi left for Simferopol (\"Aqmescit\"), where he joined Tatar activists in their campaign, edited the \"Hak Ses\" newspaper, and for a while was employed by the Crimean Ministry of Education. When the Bolshevik Red Army troops entered Crimea (\"see Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\"), he took refuge in Romania. From that moment on, Mehmet Niyazi concentrated on literary activities, entering the most prolific phase of his career. He published his works in the Arabic alphabet version of Crimean Tatar. As a community leader, he was an influence on a new wave of Crimean refugees who sought inspiration in the Second Polish Republic's \"Prometheist\" policies.\n\nSuffering from tuberculosis, he died as a result of the disease, having his last years clouded by the death of his wife Sefika. He was buried in Medgidia, with a ceremony that attracted a large crowd of his admirers. His large-scale grave (\"mezar\") was argued to have been the first modern one to bear the \"tamgha\" present on the Crimean Khanate's flag (\"see Flag of Crimea\"). The location endured as a rallying point for the Tatar community.\n"}

They founded the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nReynolds Morse was born in Denver, Colorado to Bradish P. and Anna Morse. His father ran the specialist mining and machinery concern, Morse Brothers Machinery Company. His mother was the daughter of pioneer Albert Eugene Reynolds.\n\nReynolds Morse graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He then took an MBA at the Harvard Business School. For a decade after his MBA, Reynolds worked in industry before starting his own firm, Injection Molders Supply Company in 1949.\n\nReese Morse was the daughter of Cleveland pharmaceuticals manufacturer George Reese. After graduating from the Hathaway Brown School, she earned a bachelor's degree in music from Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida in 1937. She was initiated into the Florida Gamma chapter of Pi Beta Phi chapter at Rollins College.\n\nReynolds Morse had many business, writing and collecting interests in addition to the collection of Salvador Dalí’s paintings which he and Reese Morse built up and to running Injection Molders Supply Company. For instance, he published “Injection Molding News”; added to the rock collection of the Denver Natural History Museum where he was a trustee, and he collected George Elbert Burr manuscript materials which he donated to the Denver Public Library.\n\nReynolds Morse also authored \"George Elbert Burr: Etcher of the American West\" and published an anthology of his own, which he called \"Some Fifty Unprofessional Poems\", as well as \"Gold Links Tailings\" in memory of his maternal grandfather. Reynolds Morse collected and wrote about the works of M. P. Shiel. Reynolds' \"The Works of M. P. Shiel\" was published in 1948; he later turned this work into a four-tome set and added \"The Quest for Redonda and The New King\". In 1989 Reynolds donated his Shiel collection to Olin Library at Rollins College.\n\nThe Morses' diligent collecting and their friendship with Gala and Salvador Dalí produced a valuable art collection that is now housed in the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Salvador Dalí Museum is said to be the world's most comprehensive collection of Dalí's works.\n\nThe year of their marriage the Morses began their long friendship with Dalí and on March 21, 1943 acquired their first Dalí work, \"Daddy Longlegs of the Evening - Hope!\"; early in April 1943 they acquired \"The Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's \"Angelus\"\". Over time, becoming patrons of Dalí, the Morses acquired works by Dalí which they found both captivating and intriguing. Their absorption by the artist's work led Reynolds to author numerous studies of Dalí and his \"œuvre\" and Eleanor to translate from French to English numerous books about Dalí and his \"œuvre\". In 1969, the Morses purchased \"The Hallucinogenic Toreador\", before it was completed.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1980, the Morses' considerable Dalí collection was on show in Beachwood, Ohio at the Salvador Dalí Museum, which was established there in a wing of their business premises. During that time the collection grew and required larger accommodation.\n\nThe Morses began the search for a new, permanent home for their collection. After seeing an article in the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"U.S. Art World Dillydallies over Dalí\", St. Petersburg attorney James W. Martin persuaded local leaders to approach the Morses to choose St. Petersburg. With the financial support of the City of St. Petersburg and the State of Florida, the collection was housed in the Salvador Dalí Museum, formerly a warehouse on the waterfront, which opened in March 1982. A new, larger and more storm-secure museum near the current one, opened in 1-11-11 (at 11:11 am). \n\"Sharing their knowledge and understanding of Salvador Dalí and his art has been a lifelong mission for this dedicated couple.\"\n\nThe Morses married in 1943.

In order to be like his idols, he collects airsoft weapons and tags houses, as demonstrated in \"The Garden Party\" and \"Riley Wuz Here\". He is a fan of the movie \"Scarface\" in that he occasionally quotes lines from or alludes to the movie, and he has a white suit similar to the one worn by Tony Montana.\n\nRiley seems to have a fair amount of criminal aptitude, as is demonstrated when he helped coordinate the kidnapping of Oprah Winfrey, and further demonstrated by his criticisms of Ed Wuncler III and Gin Rummy for their lack of criminal know-how (\"Let's Nab Oprah\"). Despite his pretensions to the contrary, Riley is not simpleminded: he can in fact be very resourceful and pragmatic, and \"beats\" Tom, a district attorney, in an argument over R. Kelly's confinement and trial. Perhaps due to idolizing the gangsta rap lifestyle he seems to have a level of street smarts possibly as great as his brother, often able to manipulate situations through lying and reverse psychology, which he refers to as getting into someone's \"mental mind\". Despite his crude thuggish lifestyle on rare occasions he has displayed acts of compassion (giving $100 to a panhandler he previously ignored and spat at).\n\nRiley is quite brash and abrasive and often gets into undesirable situations without considering the consequences. He is rebellious and does not listen to anyone, especially Huey and Robert. He is brutally honest to the point of being very rude.\n\nDespite the fact that Huey is forced to act as the voice of reason towards Riley's antics, usually without any success, Riley himself does become the voice of reason for his own friends, such as Thugnificent or Ed and Rummy.\n\nWhen forced to fight, he resorts to a crude and thuggish form of attack, in contrast to his brother's carefully calculated attacks. His method is simply to continue attacking, usually with concealed BB guns, and random objects, such as vases, or lamps. Riley sometimes overestimates his own crude combat abilities, such as when he tried to fight his brother in \"Let's Nab Oprah\". His thuggish fighting style, both with weapons and hand-to-hand, failed several times against the precision of Huey's martial arts ability. His street-fighting style has improved to a certain degree in season 3. He does seem to have some talent with airsoft guns, as he fought Huey to a tie in season two. He has a strong amount of endurance and determination and given his previous beatings by his grandfather seems to have a high threshold for pain.\n\nRiley has, in spite of himself, shown a great degree of intelligence from time to time. It has been shown he has a great understanding of the Media world and music industry. This was shown when he tried to advise Thugnificent against starting a rap war with a much younger aspiring rap star Sgt. Gudder, knowing it would only cause unnecessary problems.\n\nHuey and Riley tend to have a regular brotherly relationship despite their contradictory personalities. Due to the blunders Riley makes, Huey inevitably tries to teach him the error of his ways, but often to no avail. When their granddad is not around, Huey usually will not hesitate to set Riley straight himself. In \"...Or Die Trying\", Riley does not have any problem at abandoning his brother to his fate, but in other episodes he seems to trust him. Despite all this, Riley often insults his brother with the repeated phrase \"Nigga, you gay,\" usually after receiving a hug (although he just distanced himself from Huey while speaking those words in the episode \"...Or Die Trying\"). In the Season 3 finale however, Riley offers Huey a hug near the end without insulting him but admiring Huey when they saw him on the television instead.\n\nRobert Freeman is Riley's paternal grandfather. Riley constantly disrespects Robert and Robert mainly resorts to physical punishment to keep Riley in line, but Riley seems accustomed to this kind of disciplinary action to the point where it does not influence or change his actions in any significant way. He seems to not understand his grandpa's rules and gets whipped with his belt when he makes a bad choice. They are shown to be close at times and agree on things in season two. In season three, the two are seen to have \"father and son\" moments, such as when they go out to try the new fried chicken in \"The Fried Chicken Flu\". They also attempt to go to the inauguration of Barack Obama in \"It's a Black President Huey Freeman\"\n\nRiley hangs out with them and refers to them as his friends. They're the closest thing to a gang that exists in Woodcrest. They have a great variety of real firearms and are free to commit any crime they wish since Ed's grandfather essentially owns the suburb. Riley sometimes accompanies them on their various misdeeds, and is not afraid to point out when their crimes are poorly-planned, or are only successful because of Ed's grandfather's status. However, Rummy dismisses Riley's reasoning and says they get away with crimes because he (Rummy) is a criminal mastermind. However, they tend to use him for their own personal gain, such as stealing his Granddad's car with knowledge that Riley will not reveal they did it, then when it was eventually returned, they stole his new bike, fitted with rims riding as they shouted: \"Thank you for not snitching!...You stupid motherfucker!\" Riley also contacts Ed when he needs additional muscle, such as when he tries to get his Lethal Interjection chain back from Butch Magnus or when he and Huey need to seek out the Xbox Killer.\n\nRiley likes to make fun of the Dubois family – especially Tom. He mocks Tom's unmanliness, breaks Jazmine's beliefs, and makes fun of Sarah's cooking. He outwits Tom, an attorney, in an argument about R. Kelly's trial and makes fun of Tom's fear of being anally raped in prison. He also mocks Sarah's cooking by comparing her peach cobbler to vomit with peas in it.\n\n\nCindy could be considered the white female counterpart of Riley and is initially an antagonist to Riley as seen in the season two episode Ballin'. Cindy and Riley were initially rivals on different basketball teams in the local league, but in The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2, Granddad invites her over to play with him, signifying a small amount of friendship. In the Season 3 episode The Fundraiser, Cindy became a business partner of Riley's and helped him, Jazmine, and Phil, a seldom used stereotypical ignorant kid, sell large amounts of chocolate bars in order to make money. She becomes the last remaining partner of Riley, being the only one not to bail out of the organization. Her appearance in the TV series is similar to that of Cammy from the Street Fighter series.\n\nDue to their gangsta-like behavior depicted in the episode, Smokin' with Cigarettes, Riley is initially shown to be friends with Lamilton Taeshawn, as they enjoy hanging out with each other and doing bad things, such as causing a car-pile up, going on a joyride on Lamilton's grandmother's car that he stole, and smoking with cigarettes. However, Lamiltion shows more of his sociopathic behavior when he enjoys movie scenes of people being murdered, as well as murdering a dog while trespassing into his owner's property, and even assaulted his grandmother when she refused to buy him chicken. These events start to disturb Riley greatly, and ever since then, Riley finds Lamilton to be so disturbing and sick in nature and refuses to hang out with him again, and Lamilton would often try to kill Riley in return, resulting the two kids to have a brawl in the school rooftop. Despite his enmity with Lamilton, Riley cannot bear to kill him as he tried his best to prevent Lamilton from falling off the school rooftop, though Lamilton did fall (thanks to his former psychologist Dr. Doomis forcing RIley to let him go), but survived.\n\n\nThugnificent(Otis Jenkins) is Riley's favorite rap artist and neighbor. What can best be described as a \"Professional Buffoon\", Thugnificent was leader of the group Lethal interjection Crew. He had taken a liking to Riley and allowed to join. (After irresponsibly having Riley perform several reckless and dangerous stunts.) Riley and Thugnificent remained friends even after the downfall of Thugnificent's career.\n"}

Johnson Space Center.\n\nHe worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics from 1937 to 1958 and its successor NASA, until his retirement in 1973. He was involved with early research into supersonic flight and rocket-powered aircraft, and then with the United States manned space program, including the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nGilruth was born October 8, 1913, in Nashwauk, Minnesota, and moved to Duluth when he was nine years old. He graduated in 1931 from Duluth Central High School. As a teenager, Gilruth was fascinated by aeronautics and spent time building model airplanes. He was inspired to pursue a career in the field after reading about NACA’s Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in Virginia. Gilruth received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Minnesota in 1935, and received his Master of Science degree in 1936. While there he was a member of the Professional Engineering Fraternity Theta Tau, of which he was later inducted as a Hall of Fame Alumnus.\n\nIn January 1937 Gilruth was hired at NACA’s Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, where he performed flight research. His research led to the NACA Report R755, \"Requirements for Satisfactory Flying Qualities of an Airplane\", published in 1941, in which he defined a set of requirements for the handling characteristics of an aircraft. Until this point, no set of guidelines for pilots and aircraft designers existed.\n\nGilruth also pioneered the recording of data from instruments during flight test, to be later correlated with the pilot's experience. This would go on to become the standard operating procedure.\n\nGilruth had been working on hypersonic missile rockets as the assistant director of the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division of NACA. He and his team pushed their superiors to pursue a program to launch satellites into space, but he was rebuffed by administrators. The dynamic quickly changed after the Soviets succeeded in launching Sputnik, and Gilruth became involved in the transition of NACA into NASA.\nWhen NASA was created, Gilruth became head of the Space Task Group, tasked with putting a man in space before the Soviet Union.\n\nWhen President John F. Kennedy announced that America would put a man on the Moon before the end of the decade in 1961, Gilruth was \"aghast\" and unsure that such a goal could be accomplished. He was integral to the creation of the Gemini program, which he advocated as a means for NASA to learn more about operating in space before attempting a lunar landing.\n\nSoon the Apollo program was born, and Gilruth was made head of the NASA center which ran it, the new Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) (now the Johnson Space Center). Gilruth was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1969 and served as director of the MSC until his retirement in 1972. He oversaw a total of 25 manned space flights, from Mercury-Redstone 3 to Apollo 15.\n\nGilruth died in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the age of 86.\n\nIn 1992, Gilruth was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.\n\n\n"}

In 1965 he formed a vocal group, initially known as The Tempests, and later as The Royals. Frustrated with his dealings with record labels, he started his own Uhuru label in 1971. This soon folded, but he returned with the Tamoki label in 1972 and the Wambesi label in 1974. He also began producing other artists, including Gregory Isaacs' \"Way of Life\" in 1974, which established the singer as a star. \n\nIn June 1977, Cousins left his Post Office job to concentrate full-time on music, resulting in 1978's \"Pick Up The Pieces\" album, a collection of tracks from Royals 1970s singles, which is now considered one of the great reggae albums. Its success led to a contract with Ballistic Records, licensed to United Artists, with two further Royals albums following. Cousins-produced dub albums also appeared (\"Freedom Fighters Dub\" and \"Liberated Dub\"). \n\nIn 1979, cataracts almost led to Cousins losing his sight, and after recovering, he began to concentrate on production, introducing the deejay Charlie Chaplin with a series of LPs, and producing artists such as Cornell Campbell, Earl 16, Naggo Morris, and The Meditations. Cousins produced Prince Far I's final album in 1983, \"Umkhonto We Sizwe\", the chanter being fatally shot before it was finished. This prompted Cousins to emigrate to Liverpool, England, where he set up a record shop, Cousins Cove, and continues to release records on his Tamoki-Wambesi and Dove labels, both from his back-catalogue, and new recordings of visiting Jamaican artists. Another classic Cousins-produced track from this era is \"Skanky Producer\" which features the DJ Charlie Chaplin and Black Uhuru singers Don Carlos and Junior Reid.\n\n"}

{"id": "43665430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43665430", "title": "Savanna Pastoral Neolithic", "text": "Savanna Pastoral Neolithic\n\nThe Savanna Pastoral Neolithic or SPN (formerly known as the Stone Bowl Culture) is a collection of ancient societies that appeared in the Rift Valley of East Africa and surrounding areas during a time period known as the Pastoral Neolithic. Through archaeology, historical linguistics and archaeogenetics, they conventionally have been identified with the area's first Afroasiatic-speaking settlers. Archaeological dating of livestock bones and burial cairns has also established the cultural complex as the earliest center of pastoralism (cattle, goats and sheep) and stone construction in the region.\n\nThe makers of the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture are believed to have arrived in the Rift Valley sometime during the Pastoral Neolithic period (c. 3,000 BCE-700 CE). Through a series of migrations from Horn of Africa, these early Cushitic-speaking pastoralists brought cattle and caprines southward from the Sudan and/or Ethiopia into northern Kenya, probably using donkeys for transportation. According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material, they first settled in the lowlands of Kenya between 5,200 and 3,300 ybp, a phase referred to as the \"Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic\". They subsequently spread to the highlands of Kenya and Tanzania around 3,300 ybp, which is consequently known as the \"Highland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic\" phase.\n\nExcavations in the area indicate that the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic peoples were primarily cattle pastoralists. They milked this livestock, and also possessed goats, sheep, and donkeys. They typically buried their deceased in cairns. Their toolkit was characterized by a blade and bladelet-based lithic industry, earthenware pots, stone bowls and pestles, and occasional grindstones. The Savanna Pastoral Neolithic peoples sometimes hunted medium and large game on the plains, and during the culture's lowland phase, they likewise fished in Lake Turkana.\n\nSonia Mary Cole (1954) indicates that certain pestles and grindstones that she excavated from ochreous levels were stained with ochre, while others from the carbonized layers were not. She consequently suggests that the latter were instead used for grinding grain. Other scholars have argued that there is no direct archaeological evidence that SPN peoples cultivated grains or other plant domesticates.\n\nAlthough detailed information on this segment of African prehistory is not abundant, data so far available reveal a succession of cultural transformations within the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic. The transformations seem to have been fostered by both environmental change and population movements. Among these changes was the apparent abandonment of the stone bowls at around 1,300 years before present.\n\nAncient DNA analysis of a Savanna Pastoral Neolithic bone excavated at the Luxmanda site in Tanzania found that the specimen carried a large proportion of ancestry related to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic culture of the Levant, similar to that borne by modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations inhabiting the Horn of Africa. This suggests that the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture bearers may have been Cushitic speakers.\n\nGiven the similarity of their material culture and funerary customs with those of Cushitic-speaking populations that inhabited Ethiopia to the north, SPN peoples are believed to have spoken languages from the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic. According to Christopher Ehret, linguistic research suggests that these Savanna Pastoral Neolithic populations were the first Afroasiatic speakers to settle in the Central Rift Valley and surrounding areas. The region was at the time of their arrival inhabited by Khoisan hunter-gatherers who spoke Khoisan languages and practiced an Eburran blade industry. Early Nilotic settlers, who are thought to have spoken Southern Nilotic languages and been responsible for the pastoralist Elmenteitan culture, are also believed to have lived in the Rift Valley during that period.\n\nThe linguistic chronology of the historic population movements into the Central Rift Valley as well as the present and past distribution of Afro-Asiatic speakers further suggests that SPN peoples likely spoke South Cushitic languages. Ehret (1998) proposes that among these idioms were the now extinct Tale and Bisha languages, which were identified on the basis of loanwords. These early Cushitic speakers in the region largely disappeared following the Bantu Expansion.\n\nThe Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture was initially distributed at elevations below 1,100 m in lowland northern Kenya (Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic). Its range later extended to the highlands between central Kenya and northern Tanzania, at elevations above 1,500 m (Highland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic). The preferred settlement location for SPN sites was open wooded grassland on well-drained, gentle slopes of between 1,500 m to 2,050 m.\n\nThe Savanna Pastoral Neolithic makers' characteristic stone bowls have been recovered from both their occupation sites and burial cairns.\n\nTheir material culture was typified by several pottery styles, up to three of which may be found at a single site. Nderit pottery (previously known as Gumban A) was produced by early SPN herders in the Turkana Basin. The most diagnostic SPN pottery farther south is Narosura pottery, and some scholars group Akira (TIP), Maringishu (trellis motif), and herringbone-motif wares in with the SPN as well.\n\nIn terms of funerary tradition, the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic peoples erected stone cairns in open spaces, rock shelters, crevices or against walls. The deceased were buried with a number of items, including stone bowls, pestle rubbers and ochre palettes. Large obsidian blades and other tools were also occasionally among the mortuary objects. Incisor removal was not a common feature of this population.\n\n"}

Gruenbaum was the first Interior Minister of the State of Israel.\n\nYitzhak (\"Itche\") Gruenbaum was born in Warsaw, Poland. While a student of jurisprudence, he began activities on behalf of the Zionist movement and engaged in journalism. He served as editor of several periodicals widely circulated among Polish Jewry, including the Hebrew \"Ha-Zefirah\" and the Hebrew weekly \"Ha-Olam.\" Under his editorship, the Yiddish daily, \"Haynt,\" took on a pro-Zionist slant.\n\nIn Poland, Gruenbaum headed the Radical Zionist faction, initially known in Poland as \"Al Hamishmar\". In 1919 he was elected to the Sejm (Polish parliament), where, together with Apolinary Hartglas, he organized a \"Jewish bloc\" that united most of the Jewish parties. He was the moving force in forming a collaboration with other minority parties represented in the Sejm, including Germans, Ukrainians, and others, to form a Bloc of National Minorities alliance in 1922, that acted to represent the rights of minority populations in Poland. His efforts brought about an increase of Jewish representation in the Sejm, which was accompanied by a rise of the political Zionism. Gruenbaum was known for his courageous and militant stance against his opponents and on behalf of minorities' interests, while equally critical of the ultra-orthodox party \"Agudat Israel\" and Jewish lobbying.\n\nAfter moving to Paris in 1932, Gruenbaum immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1933 after being elected to the Jewish Agency Executive (the Board of Directors), during the Eighteenth Congress of the Zionist Organization.\n\nDuring the Holocaust, he served on the \"Committee of Four\" chosen at the outbreak of World War II to maintain contact with Polish Jewry and aid in their rescue. In 1942, when word reached the Yishuv of the mass extermination by the German occupying forces taking place in Eastern Europe, Gruenbaum was chosen to head a 12-member Rescue Committee comprising representatives of the various parties. Due to circumstances prevailing at the time, their rescue efforts failed to accomplish much.\n\nAt the war's end, he endured a personal crisis involving his son, Eliezer Gruenbaum. The latter, a Holocaust survivor, was accused in Paris by two other Jewish Holocaust survivors of having served as a \"Kapo\" and acting with cruelty towards Jewish prisoners. During his son's detention and trial, Gruenbaum remained at his side. Yitzhak helped his son move to Palestine after the war, but there his son has been subject to \"attacks by right-wing and religious groups eager, among other things, to discredit his father.\" The matter was eventually closed; not long afterwards, Eliezer Gruenbaum fell in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\nIn 1946, Gruenbaum was among the Jewish Agency directors arrested by the British and interned in a detention camp at Latrun.\n\nHe spent his later years on Kibbutz Gan Shmuel, and died in 1970.\n\nGruenbaum was among a group of 13 leaders forming the provisional government of the emerging State, and, as a member of Provisional State Council (Moetzet HaAm), signed its declaration of independence. Between 1948 and 1949 he served as a member of the Provisional State Council and was the first Minister of the Interior in that formative period. His initial stance was with the General Zionists, but as time went on moved leftward. He became an adherent of the Mapam socialist-Zionist party, and was known as a declared secularist. Gruenbaum headed an independent list in the elections for the first Knesset, but failed to obtain the minimum number of votes to secure a seat.\n\nHe was later a candidate for President in the 1952 presidential election alongside Yitzhak Ben-Zvi of Mapai, Peretz Bernstein of the General Zionists and Mordechai Nurock of Mizrachi. However, he was beaten by Ben-Zvi.\n\nHe served as editor of the Hebrew \"Ha-Zefirah\", the Hebrew weekly \"Ha-Olam\" and the Yiddish daily, \"Haynt.\"\nGruenbaum was the editor of the Encyclopedia of Diaspora Communities, \"The Zionist Movement and its Development\" and many other books.\nAlonei Yitzhak, an Israeli youth village near Binyamina in northern Israel, is named for him.\n\n\"One cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Europe.\"\n\n\"I think it is necessary to state here – Zionism is above everything. I will not demand that the Jewish Agency allocate a sum of 300,000 or 100,000 pounds sterling to help European Jewry. And I think that whoever demands such things is performing an anti-Zionist act.\"\n\n\n"}

From 1946 through 1954, he was First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR. \n\nHe was born to a poor peasant family in a small village in Borisov County (okrug), which in 1924 was incorporated as one of the nine rural areas in the Sherbakulsky District of the Omsk Oblast. In 1915, he went to the two-year Kazakh-Russian school in what is now the Poltava Raion, graduating in 1917. He attended the Narimanov Institute in Moscow, but did not complete his first year.
