He was a Catalan, a Franciscan, and a bachelor of theology. He is the only well-known archbishop of Athens from the fourteenth century. During his stay in Athens, he lived in an annex of the Erechtheum.\n\nBallester was elected to his archbishopric with the support of the Republic of Venice and he had influence himself in Italy. Ballester supported Peter IV of Aragon against Maria of Sicily in 1381. He also supported the Crown of Aragon over and against the Navarrese Company. In November 1379 Sibilia, queen of Peter IV, tried to procure those relics of the Virgin which were kept at Athens from Ballester and since they were absent the Parthenon in 1395, it seems likely that she succeeded.\n\nOn his death, John I of Aragon requested Antipope Clement VII to appoint one Antonio de Blasis to the vacant see. While some modern historians have doubted that Ballester was in fact dead when John requested the appointment of de Blasis, it has now been proven that he was. It was sometimes held that Ballester had in fact been captured by Nerio I Acciajuoli and later crowned Martin of Aragon in 1399, but this is false and arose from a confusion of the two Antonios.\n\n"}

During the 1960s, there was a steady demand for young British women to come to the U.S. and fill temporary or permanent secretarial positions. Reasons stated for the demand included a secretarial shortage in the U.S., better aptitude and seriousness for detail work among the British, and the perceived prestige in the U.S. of having an English accent answer the phone. For the British women who came over, there was a chance for better pay and advancement in the U.S. than within the British class system.\n\nThe association's stated purpose was that it \"offers assistance to members seeking jobs and apartments, and generally helps girls new to this country to settle in New York.\" It also helped members navigate the New York social and dating scene, and the association threw parties of their own as well.\n\nThe association is remembered for one unusual recorded vocal chorus effort, when they performed IBM corporate spirit songs on the 1969 album \"Paean\". The album was the idea of the computer software and consulting company Advanced Computer Techniques, all of whose secretaries at the time came from England. The album's songs and recordings were judged as \"quite endearing\" by \"InfoWorld\" magazine some years later, and software design pioneer Larry Constantine subsequently described the association's role on the record with just one word: \"indeed!\"\n\nBy 1971, the association had about 80 members. At meetings they discussed, or heard from speakers on, topics such as safety, cultural trips, vacations, and techniques for shorthand.

His style of criticism, acerbic, flowery and (perhaps most importantly) carried out on the first night of productions, set the standard for theatre reviewers through to today.\n\nScott accumulated enemies among theatre managers, actors and playwrights as years went on, picking quarrels with William Archer, Ibsen, George Bernard Shaw and others. After he gave a particularly ill-considered 1898 interview, in which he attacked the morals of theatre people, especially actresses, he was forced to retire as a theatre critic and his reputation and prospects suffered badly until, by the end of his life, he was impoverished.\n\nBorn the son of William Scott, the perpetual curate of Hoxton in north London, Scott converted to Roman Catholicism before his 21st birthday. Educated at Marlborough College, he became a civil servant, working in the War Office beginning in 1860.\n\nEncouraged to write by the humorist Tom Hood the younger, who also was a clerk in the War Office, Scott contributed to \"The Era\", \"Weekly Dispatch\", and to Hood's own paper, \"Fun\", where Scott and W. S. Gilbert were colleagues. Scott's interest in writing and the theatre led him to brief dalliance with the failed \"Victoria Review\".\n\nHe became the dramatic writer for \"The Sunday Times\" in 1863 but held the position for only two years because of the intemperance of his published opinions and his unpopular praise of the French theatre. In 1871, Scott began his nearly thirty years as a theatre critic with \"The Daily Telegraph\". He also contributed regularly to \"The Theatre\", a magazine that he founded, and wrote sentimental poetry and song lyrics (including \"Oh Promise Me\"), which were often published in the magazine \"Punch\" by his friend, the editor, F. C. Burnand. Scott continued to work at the War Office until 1879, when he finally decided to earn his living entirely by writing.\n\nAs well as criticism, Scott wrote plays, including \"The Vicarage\", \"The Cape Mail\", \"Anne Mié\", \"Odette\", and \"The Great Divorce Case\". He wrote several English adaptations of Victorien Sardou's plays, some of which were written in collaboration with B. C. Stephenson, such as \"Nos intimes\" (as \"Peril\") and \"Dora\" (1878, as \"Diplomacy\"). The latter was described by the theatrical paper \"The Era\" as \"the great dramatic hit of the season\". It also played with success at Wallack's Theatre in New York. Scott and Stephenson also wrote an English version of Halévy and Meilhac's libretto for Lecocq's operetta \"Le Petit Duc\" (1878). Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production. For all of these, Scott adopted the pen name \"Saville Rowe\" (after Savile Row) to match Stephenson's pseudonym, \"Bolton Rowe\", another Mayfair street. The pieces with Stephenson were produced by the Bancrofts, the producers of T. W. Robertson's plays, which Scott admired. He also wrote accounts of holiday tours around the British Isles and abroad, becoming known for his florid style. Scott's travels also inspired his creative writing. Some sources say that after a tour of New Zealand, he wrote the tune to the \"Swiss Cradle Song\", later adapted as \"Now Is the Hour\" and as \"Haere Ra\", the Māori farewell song, which white New Zealanders \"mistakenly thought [to be] an old Maori folksong\". It is also used for the hymn \"Search Me, O God\", with lyrics by J. Edwin Orr. However, an Australian family has long claimed that the \"Clement Scott\" who wrote the tune is a pseudonym for a family member.\n\nIn 1883, the \"Daily Telegraph\" printed an article which Scott had written about a visit to the north Norfolk coast. He became enamoured of the district and gave it the name \"Poppyland\". His writing was responsible for members of the London theatre set visiting and investing in homes in the area. Ironically, he was unhappy at the result of his popularisation of this previously pristine area.\nScott married Isabel Busson du Maurier, the sister of George du Maurier, and the couple had four children. She died in 1890, and he remarried Constance Margarite Brandon, an American journalist and actress, in San Francisco. Scott's long-time wish to be elected a member of the famous literary gentlemen's club, the Garrick Club (to which Henry Irving, Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, among many other notable men belonged), was finally realised in 1892. After an ill-considered 1898 interview in \"Great Thoughts\", Scott was forced to retire as a theatre critic and moved to Biarritz to write \"The Drama of Yesterday and Today\". He then worked for a couple of years at the end of the century for the \"New York Herald\", later returning to London. In 1900, he founded \"The Free Lance, a Popular Society and Critical Journal\", for writers who worked by the job, which he edited.\n\nScott fell into illness and poverty in his last years and died at his residence in Woburn Square at the age of 62.\n\nScott's position on the \"Daily Telegraph\" and the support of its proprietor, J. M. Levy, allowed him to pioneer the essay-style review of drama, which came to replace the earlier bare notices. His column of notes and reviews became very popular throughout Britain, and later his own magazine, \"The Theatre\", achieved wide circulation. He wrote his theatre reviews immediately after he saw the opening night of a piece which, together with his short temper and his dislike of critic William Archer, the chief English supporter of Ibsen, tended to involve him often in controversies.\n\nScott played an important part in encouraging a more attentive attitude by theatre audiences. In his early days, it was not uncommon for audiences to be very boisterous and noisy, frequently booing and talking during productions, especially through the overture. He also insisted on first night reviews. It had been common for reviewers to wait a few days before writing about a production. Scott insisted that the paying audience on the first night should expect to see a fully fledged production, and not one where the leading characters did not know all their lines. Theatre managers disliked the opening night reviews when they felt that a new piece had not had time to settle down yet. On the other hand, Scott supported actor-managers of his time by providing them with translations of popular French plays and with his own plays.\nEarly in his career, he wrote approvingly of the \"cup and saucer\" realism movement, led by T. W. Robertson, whose plays were notable for treating contemporary British subjects in realistic settings. Later, he favoured the grand and spectacular type of London theatrical production which had developed with new types of theatre building, electric lighting and technologies allowed more and more adventurous staging. As time went on, he became strongly conservative and opposed to the new drama of Ibsen and Shaw, arguing that domestic intrigue, sexual situations and wordy philosophising were inappropriate for an evening at the theatre, and even harmful to society, especially young women. Scott especially became embroiled in legal claims through his outspoken criticism of various actors and actresses. His scathing attacks on Ibsen and Shaw became evident in their lack of journalistic neutrality.\n\nScott outraged the theatre community with an extraordinary attack on the morals of theatre people in general, and especially of actresses, in an interview that was published in the evangelical weekly \"Great Thoughts\" in 1898. He said that the theatre warps people's character and that it was impossible for a pure woman to be successful in a stage career, and that all leading actresses were immoral and could have achieved their success only by virtue of the extent of their \"compliance\". Even before the publication, the transcript of the interview was released to the press, and Scott immediately received a firestorm of condemnation. Although he apologised and recanted his remarks, he was barred from theatres, and the \"Daily Telegraph\" was forced to dismiss him. He soon retired and found his reputation and prospects much diminished. By the end of his life, however, he received a measure of forgiveness, and shortly before his death the theatre community held a generous benefit for him.\n\nHis papers are located in the library of Rochester University, New York State. Film maker John Madden (\"Shakespeare in Love\", \"Mrs. Brown\", \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\") made his first feature film for the BBC, \"Poppyland\" (1985), around the story of Scott's visit to Poppyland.\n\n\n"}

He is said to be the son of a certain Cinbelim or Cynfelyn, the son of Dumnagual Hen, an early ruler of Alt Clut (later known as Strathclyde). The later genealogy \"Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd\" gives an altered version of this genealogy; here Cynfelyn is Clydno's grandfather, and the family is attached to the line of the ancestor figure Coel Hen.\n\nAn attack by Clydno and several other northern rulers on Gwynedd in North Wales is recounted in the Gwynedd version of the Welsh laws preserved in the \"Book of Chirk\". According to the story, after Elidir Mwynfawr, a prince of the North, had been slain in Gwynedd, Clydno joined with Rhydderch Hael and two other kings called Nudd Hael and Mordaf Hael to avenge him. They proceeded to raid and burn Arfon until Rhun ap Maelgwn and the armies of Gwynedd forced them out.\n\nClydno's name also appears in lists of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain. According to these lists, Clydno possessed a magical halter, the \"Cebystr Clydno Eiddin\". The explanatory note attached to later versions of the lists explain the halter's property: when he affixed it to a staple at the foot of his bed, he would find whatever horse he wished in it. \n\nClydno's son Cynon was also a figure of Welsh tradition. The poem \"Y Gododdin\" names him as one of the Britons who fought against the Angles at the disastrous Battle of Catraeth; at one point the poem identifies him as the only survivor. Later works mention Cynon's great love for Morvydd, daughter of Urien Rheged, and he appears in the prose tale \"Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain\", taking the role given to Calogrenant in other versions of the story.\n\n"}

An inquest in 2015 found that Begley's death had been partly due to the actions of Greater Manchester Police officers who shot him with a Taser while they restrained and handcuffed him around two hours prior to his death.\n\nBegley grew up in Wythenshawe, Manchester, and moved to Gorton, Manchester aged 17. After getting into trouble with police in his teens, he began working in an ice cream factory. His mother, Dorothy Begley, said her son \"grew up overnight\". Dorothy Begley had previous called 999 on New Year's Eve 2011 because Jordan had become aggressive and threatened to harm others and himself; however, he later returned home without incident.\n\nA month before his death Begley had received tests for blackouts and intermittent chest pain. No abnormality was found, but doctors asked him to return for a more detailed test. Begley did not attend the appointment. Begley was a heavy drinker and used cocaine. At the time of his death he had intended to put down a deposit for a flat for himself, his girlfriend and her daughter.\n\nFigures published by the Home Office show that since the introduction of Tasers in 2003, their use had increased by more than 200 percent, that more than one in every ten officers carried a Taser, and that more than 10,000 Taser incidents had been recorded in England and Wales in 2013.\n\nDorothy Begley initially called police on the evening of 10 July 2013 as her son had become upset following an argument with neighbours and was threatening to take a knife outside, causing her to fear that there would be \"a murder\". She did not tell Begley she had called the police.\n\nArmed Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officers rushed into Begley's dining room in Gorton. Eleven officers were deployed. Begley was initially outside the house but agreed to go inside with the officers, and a standoff developed, which ended with Police Constable (PC) Terrence Donnelly drawing his Taser X26 and opening fire. Begley was immediately restrained when he offered minimal resistance.\n\nBegley was punched twice by PC Christopher Mills as other officers attempted to handcuff him. He was hit with \"distraction strikes\" and shot with a 50,000-volt Taser while he was handcuffed and restrained by three armed officers. The Taser shot lasted nine seconds and was from a distance of 70 centimetres. It was attributed by police to Donnelly having entered \"a high state of alert.\" The officers left Begley lying face-down with his hands cuffed behind his back.\n\nThe inquest was later told that Donnelly had been made aware that Begley was potentially in possession of a knife. Donnelly said that Begley's hands were in his pockets, and that he asked him to show his hands to determine the whereabouts of a weapon, and to stop moving. According to Donnelly, Begley continued to approach him, after which he told him to stand still, then deployed the Taser. Dorothy Begley said her son had been \"doing exactly what they wanted him to do\" when the Taser was used.\n\nThe inquest jury's verdict said that after Begley was forced to the floor the officers did not attempt to determine whether he was conscious, and ignored the fact that he did not cry out or speak. When he was turned over on to his back it became clear that he was in distress. Sergeant Andrew Wright said Begley had an \"ashen\" colour to his face and a \"golf ball\"-sized lump on his head when he was rolled over, and that his breathing was irregular. Officers removed his handcuffs and attempted to revive him using a trauma kit, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and a defibrillator.\n\nBegley died in Manchester Royal Infirmary at 10 pm on 10 July, around two hours after the incident, from a cardiac arrest. Begley was 23 at the time of his death. His funeral, which was paid for by the police, took place at Sacred Heart Church in Gorton on 17 September 2013.\n\nIn August 2013 Dorothy Begley said she believed her son's death was due to a case of mistaken identity relating to a 25-year-old man from Sale, Greater Manchester also named Jordan Begley, who was on the run from prison. Begley said that on the night of her son's death an officer had questioned her about links to Sale. Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley said police were \"not aware of any evidence to support that suggestion at this time.\"\n\nAn inquest was held at Manchester civil courts of justice over a period of five weeks in 2015.\n\nLawyers for Donnelly and four other officers unsuccessfully sought a permanent anonymity order, which would have prevented their being identified at the inquest. In February 2015 Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows refused the anonymity order, and named Donnelly, Mills, PC Peter Fox, PC Dave Graham and PC Andrew Wright as the officers who were present at the scene. Meadows said he had not been persuaded by arguments that the officers would face reprisals if their identities were publicised.\n\nDonnelly, Fox, Graham, Mills and Wright, all serving GMP officers, gave evidence. In June 2015 Wright denied colluding with other officers regarding his evidence. Medical experts who gave evidence said the Taser was \"unlikely\" to have contributed to Begley's cardiac arrest. The coroner said the inquest had \"been a long case with a lot of evidence\" which had been \"different and inconsistent\". The jury retired on 2 July.\n\nThe jury concluded in a narrative verdict on 6 July that the use of the Taser did not directly cause Begley's heart to stop, but the restraint and the Taser \"more than materially contributed\" to a combination of stressful factors which triggered cardiac arrest. Other factors included Begley's alcoholism, his drug abuse, a dispute with neighbours, and the confrontation with police which followed. The jury also found that Donnelly had acted \"inappropriately and unreasonably\" in using the Taser for longer than was necessary. and found that the two punches delivered as \"distraction blows\" by one officer were unnecessary. The verdict said \"there was no need to punch twice without even checking his first response to the first punch.\" The jury also found that the officers were \"more concerned about their own welfare\" than that of Begley.\n\nThe ruling marked the first time an inquest jury had found the use of a Taser to have contributed to a death.\n\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) also conducted an investigation, which effectively exonerated the officers involved. As of July 2015 the IPCC had not published the results of its investigation. The result of the inquest caused the IPCC to review its investigation, and in August 2016 the IPCC won permission for a judicial review of its own report into Begley's death. This was the first time the IPCC had applied for a judicial review of an independent investigation.\n\nBegley's family said after the outcome that they intended to sue the GMP. Dorothy Begley called for the immediate introduction of police body cameras and questioned why the officers involved had not been disciplined. She described the decision as \"fantastic\" and said \"After two years of fighting everybody, fighting the system, Jordon's day has come. That is all I ever wanted. The last two years have been hell.\" She also said her trust in the police had been \"devastated and broken\", and criticised the IPCC's report, which she said was \"not worth the paper it's written on.\" Dorothy Begley's lawyer, Mark McGhee, said the inquest's outcome would extent \"far beyond the death of this one individual\".\n\nIan Hanson, the chair of the GMP branch of the Police Federation of England and Wales, emphasised the \"dynamic\" nature and short time-frame of the situation in which the Taser was used, and said \"Unlike a jury, officers do not have five weeks to take decisions, and many of the [jury's] criticisms do not appear to us to reflect the reality and duration of this incident.\" Dawn Copley, the GMP's assistant chief constable said the verdict \"raised a number of serious concerns, including the way the Taser was used, the use of force by the officers after the Taser was deployed and ... the communication between the officers who attended Jordon's home.\" Copley said the GMP would \"examine the jury's findings in detail\" and liaise with the IPCC and that she had restricted the duties of the officers involved.\n\nIn the wake of the verdict the National Police Chiefs' Council called for an independent body to examine the medical evidence and determine whether safety advice on Tasers should be changed in light of Begley's death. GMP Chief Constable Peter Fahy defended the use of Tasers by police, and said the record of British police in terms of force was \"remarkable.\"\n\n"}

In Hinduism, the devatas that guard the eight, nine and ten cardinal points are called Lokapala (Guardians of the Directions) or, more specifically in ancient Java tradition, \"Dewata Nawa Sanga\" (Guardians of Nine Directions).

His father moved out of the house, while his mother went back to school. His mother and sisters worked to keep the family afloat. He found solace in weight lifting, pumping iron for hours alone in his room. He also found solace in surfing.\n\nEd Gantner's major football career started at Edgewater High School. Around his junior year, he started using steroids. Between his junior and senior years in high school, he gained 45 lbs. His newly found physique gained him confidence to point, where he talked incessantly about the weight he gained, how much he could lift, and the size of his biceps and neck.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, he got a college scholarship to play football for the University of Tennessee, but after less than a year, he became depressed and homesick.\n\nAfter returning home to Orlando, he took a hiatus, working as a bartender and a bouncer. In 1980, he returned to playing college football, this time for the University of Central Florida, as a starter. He was also had the honor of being the first man from the college to go professional. He played pro football in the United States Football League, where he played for the Tampa Bay Bandits for one year, and for the Jacksonville Bulls for two years.\n\nEd \"The Bull\" Gantner made his pro wrestling debut in 1985 in Championship Wrestling from Florida. Gantner started out as a heel, as a part of the House of Humperdink, led by Sir Oliver Humperdink. Within the group, he formed a tag team with Kareem Muhammed called the Shock Troops. They made their debut on TV jumping The Fabulous Ones starting a program with them. They also unsuccessfully challenged The Road Warriors at Battle Of The Belts 3 on September 3, 1986. He would also have a feud with Lex Luger that would go on for a good part of 1986.\n\nIn February 1987, Gantner was awarded the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship, after his manager Sir Oliver Humperdink defeated Bad News Allen for the title. After losing the title to Mike Rotunda a month later, Gantner turn on Humperdink, turning him face. Gantner feuded with Humperdink's group with Barry Windham, Blackjack Mulligan, Bugsy McGraw and even Dusty Rhodes as his partner at different times. However, by July 1987, even with him in most of the major angles for Championship Wrestling from Florida, he abruptly retired from pro wrestling due to health issues.\n\nIn 1988, Gantner's health began to go downhill after years of steroid use. His kidneys were the first to start failing, causing him to undergo kidney dialysis, forced him to be hooked up several hours a week to a machine to survive.\n\nDoctors also forced Gantner to lose 100 lbs, as he nearly weighed 300 lbs. He complied by giving up red meat and starting a holistic diet, making his own watermelon tea. Despite the changes, he could not stop using steroids and had started using cocaine. He was rushed to the hospital for heart failure four times within two months. At that point, he started asking around for a firearm.\n\nBy the fall of 1989, his heart and kidneys were failing, after refusing doctors' orders to lose weight and alter his exercise regimen. On Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 1989, Gantner received a kidney transplant, as his sister donated her kidney. His family thought the worst was over. However, five days after the transplant, he asked that weights be brought to his room, as he went back to using steroids.\n\nThe strain of recovering from the transplant caused Gantner to lose weight, but he had still an imposing figure. Despite this, when he looked into a mirror, he saw a defective, distorted image. Self-conscious about his physique, he would wear shorts under his jeans to look bigger. While in the gym, he would wear an extra pair of socks to bulk up his calves. Over the next six months, he would go back to the hospital five times, because of complications. He would also move from Orlando, to St. Augustine, to West Palm Beach, working as a salesman.\n\nEarly in the fall of 1990, Gantner's mental health began to falter, as he started calling his parents late at night. He would get dressed for work, make it to his car, and sit there for a half-hour with the keys in the ignition, before going back in his house. When his mother finally decided to bring him home in Orlando, she found him in a dark room, sitting down, rocking on his bed.\n\nBack home with his parents in Orlando, Gantner would not eat, sleep, or work out. He would shower constantly and pace all night long. When his mother tried to take him for a haircut, he made her drive all over town, and at each stop, he refused to leave the car.\n\nBy November 1990, Gantner was placed in a psychiatric ward at a Florida hospital, where he stayed until after Christmas. During this time, he began casting about for solutions and new truths—meditation, vitamins, even faith healing with Rev. Benny Hinn.\n\nFeeling defeated, on New Year's Eve, December 31, 1990, Ed Gantner committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart in the kitchen of his parents' home in Orlando, Florida. He was 31 years old.\n\n\n"}

He invented a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine with electric ignition and described it in a French patent published in 1807. In 1808 he fitted it into a primitive working vehicle – \"the world's first internal combustion powered automobile\".\n\nIsaac was born in Paris to a family from Valais. In 1763 the family settled in Moûtiers in Savoy (Kingdom of Sardinia). The last two boys, Anne Joseph and Isaac, came to settle in St. Gingolph in Valais. It is not known at which schools he studied, but he became fluent in Latin plus mastering mathematics and geometry, whilst continuing his study of mechanics throughout his life. He qualified as both a surveyor and notary and worked for the state of Valais.\n\nIsaac had many interests plus an intuitive and extremely curious mind which was driven by the \"demon of discovery\". His experimental work was overflowing. He experimented with steam-powered vehicles in the late 18th century. He also studied the ignition of combustible gases.\n\nAfter retirement from the Army, living in Switzerland, he invented a primitive internal combustion engine which he constructed in 1807. It was powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen manually ignited by electric spark, but the engine neither involved the in-cylinder compression, the crank, nor the connecting rod. A year later, Isaac built an early automobile for his new engine to power. His engine was never commercially successful.\n\nCoincidentally, in 1807 Nicéphore Niépce installed his 'moss, coal-dust and resin'-fueled Pyréolophore internal combustion engine in a boat and powered up the river Saone in France to be granted a patent by the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. The discrete, virtually simultaneous, implementations of these two designs of internal combustion in different modes of transport means that the de Rivaz engine can be correctly described as \"the worlds first use of an internal combustion engine in an auto-mobile (in 1808)\", whilst the \"Pyréolophore (in 1807) was the world's first use of an internal combustion engine in a ship\".\n\nAlthough de Rivaz's early work is credited as the first use of the internal combustion engine in an automobile, the further development and mass production of the invention never truly began until the late nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1824, the French physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot scientifically established the thermodynamic theory of idealized heat engines. This highlighted the shortcoming of these pioneering designs, whereby they needed a compression mechanism to increase the difference between the upper and lower working temperatures and potentially unlock sufficient power and efficiency. Gasoline was not used for internal combustion engines until 1870 when carburetors were invented to convert non-combustible liquid fuels into a combustible gaseous mixture form.\n\n\n"}

Belvin\n\nHarry James Watson \"Jimmy\" Belvin (1900 -1986) was an educator and served as an Oklahoma State Representative and Senator. He was the first elected principal chief of any of the Five Civilized Tribes in the 20th century, and the longest serving principal chief of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. He saw his tribe through termination, restoration, and a rebirth of Native Pride. He was a polarizing leader, seen by some as a semi-dictator who held onto the office of principal chief and used his power to advocate for complete assimilation into the dominant society, suppressing Choctaw traditions, language and ceremonial practices as undesirable remnants of an unrefined history. To others, he was a well-liked, populist leader, who went door-to-door talking with tribe members, informing them on issues, and trying to develop the means the alleviate the poverty and unemployment they faced.\n\nJimmy Belvin was born in Boswell Choctaw County, Indian Territory on December 11, 1900 to Watson J. and Mabel Powers Belvin. He was a direct descendant of the original Belvins who were forced over the Trail of Tears from Mississippi to Indian Territory. He attended school in Boswell and graduated from Southeastern Teachers College with a Bachelor of Science degree, going on to earn a Master's of Education at the University of Oklahoma which he completed in 1941.\n\nBelvin taught school at Mayhew, Bryan County and in Choctaw County from 1923 until 1939. In 1941 he was elected Bryan County Superintendent of Public Instruction, a position he held until 1952. He then began operating a Hereford cattle ranch in Bryan and Choctaw counties.\n\nAfter his first successful election to the Oklahoma legislature in 1955, Belvin served three terms in the Oklahoma State House of Representatives representing Bryan County. In 1960, he was elected as an Oklahoma State Senator.\n\nAs early as 1946, support for Belvin becoming principal chief had been growing. William A. Durant had served since 1937, and was seen as having made little headway on selling the asphalt lands of the Choctaw and Chickasaw. At issue were some of lands that were jointly owned by the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes. Based on a 1902 agreement, the US had agreed to purchase these lands within three years, but had still not done so. In 1946, Chief Durant and Chickasaw Governor Floyd Maytubby were asking for $33.1 million which the US government valued at $2.2 million. Belvin was, on the other hand was seen as an educated, galvanized leader who wanted to revitalize the tribe. Even before he was chief, he wrote long letters to Congressman Carl Albert, Congressman William Stigler, Senator Elmer Thomas, Senator Edward H. Moore, the Bureau of Indian Affairs office, and the Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes criticizing the delays in finalizing the purchase.\n\nWhen a settlement was finally reached of $8.5 million, Belvin again launched a letter-writing campaign questioning why the settlement was reached without allowing representatives of the Choctaw-Chickasaw Confederation to attend the negotiations. Considering that the land contained 770 million tons of readily available coal, another 1 billion tons of reserve coal and asphalt, and was near a recent oil strike, Belvin questioned how the coal could be valued at 1 cent per ton and the reserve coal, valued at 0.1 cent per ton. Belvin was also highly critical of the fact that Chief Durant had not attended the negotiations, leaving the decision of \"the most momentous meeting affecting the tribe's welfare since the Atoka Agreement of 1897\" up to Maytubby and the Choctaw Tribal attorney.\n\nChoctaw-Chickasaw Confederation was officially created on 9 January 1947, though it had operated for several years, as a means for the tribes to track tribal assets, hold meetings and discussions and disseminate information outside of the \"official\" BIA structure. After the sale had been negotiated, Belvin wrote letters as president of the Confederation to tribal members and urged them to attend informational meetings and decide whether or not they wanted to accept the offer. He did not give his own opinions, but urged each tribemember to vote according to their own conscience. Though he thought the settlement amount was undervalued, once he became chief, Belvin stopped criticizing the amount and strove to collect the distribution so desperately needed by his poverty stricken tribe members.\n\nBelvin was first elected as Principal Chief of the Choctaw Nation in 1948. In fact, he was the first elected chief of any of the Five Civilized Tribes and of the Choctaw Nation in the 20th century. All chiefs of the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma since the implementation of the Dawes Act had been appointed by the president upon recommendation from the BIA. Until the 1970s, the only two exceptions to presidential appointment were that in 1948 and again in 1954, the Choctaw were allowed to elect their chief. Both times, they elected Belvin, though voting was limited to a fraction of the eligible enrollees.\n\nIn the lead up to the 1954 election, the Department of the Interior informed Belvin that they did not believe the tribe warranted a full-time chief. Belvin contacted Congressman Carl Albert, also a proponent of tribal democracy, who worked behind the scenes to keep the Choctaw Principal Chief as a full-time position. Belvin believed so strongly in the right of the tribes to elect their own governance, that he persuaded the Chickasaw to press for their own elections. Though the Chickasaw tried for many years to convince the Bureau of Indian Affairs to allow them to vote on their own leadership, their requests were ignored.\n\nThere had been several joint relationships among the Five Civilized Tribes throughout their history—the 1842 Inter-Tribal Council of the Deep Fork River, the 1861 United Nations of Indian Territory, and the 1866 Okmulgee Council. Because of their similar histories and situations in Oklahoma, with removal, allotment, and government oversight, there was a recognition that tribal goals for development, education, services for tribe members, health initiatives and poverty alleviation were virtually the same and working together would be of benefit. In fact, informally the tribes had already been working jointly on projects. In March, 1949, Belvin had gone to Washington, DC not only to prod lawmakers regarding the coal and asphalt settlement, but to present a proposal drawn up by representatives of the five tribes as a far-reaching \"relief\" plan. They proposed more effective administration of Indian affairs, a new land policy, rehabilitation, education, health, conservation, and road building and maintenance as the means to alleviate distress in their nations and had obtained the endorsement from the local agency office.\n\nIn September and October 1949, the leaders of the Five Civilized Tribes met in Muskogee, Oklahoma and formed the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes (ITC). They pledged to work together to attain for themselves and their descendants the rights and benefits which they were entitled to under law, state or federal, and to seek equity for tribal affairs and tribe members by promoting the common welfare of American Indians. The constitution of the organization was approved on February 3, 1950. Inter-Tribal Council membership includes the principal chief and four members from each of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole nations.\n\nBelvin served on the ITC from its founding in 1949 through 1975. After obtaining Congressional approval, and pressing for the withdrawal of House Concurrent Resolution 108, the ITC has spent over a half-century of activity focusing on education, health care, housing, and sovereignty to serve the special cultural, economic, and social needs of all tribespeople.\n\nAs part of the Indian termination policy pursued by the US government from the 1940s through the 1960s, a series of laws were passed to enable the government to end its trust relationships with native tribes. One of the first of these laws passed on August 13, 1946—the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-726, ch. 959. Its purpose was to settle for all time any outstanding grievances or claims the tribes might have against the U.S. for treaty breaches, unauthorized taking of land, dishonorable or unfair dealings, or inadequate compensation. Claims had to be filed within a five-year period, and most of the 370 complaints that were submitted were filed at the approach of the 5-year deadline in August, 1951. In 1946, the government had appropriated funds for the tribal sale of coal and asphalt resources, but had charged almost 10% of the $8.5 million award in administrative fees.\n\nWhen Belvin became chief in 1948, he realized that only federally recognized tribes were allowed to file a claim with the Commission. If he wanted to get that money back, his tribe needed to reorganize. He created a democratically elected tribal council and a constitution to re-establish a government, but his efforts were opposed by the Area Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Ultimately, the tribe was able to file a claim for around $750,000 with the Commission in 1951 on a technicality. The suit was classified as a renewal of the 1944 case against the US Court of Claims, but that did not stop the antagonism between Belvin and the area BIA officials. The BIA had had management issues for decades. Poorly trained personnel, inefficiency, corruption, and lack of consistent policy plagued the organization almost from its founding. For Belvin, relief from BIA oversight of policies and funds seemed as if it might pave the way for the Choctaw to maintain their own traditional ways of operating and reform their own governing council.\n\nEarly on, it may also be that Belvin believed termination was what the tribe wanted. In a 1954 presentation to the Intertribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes, he told the chiefs of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek and Seminole nations that the majority of Choctaw were not interested in tribal affairs and supported discontinuance of the tribe. But, he also stated in an interview that same year with the \"Lubbock Avalanche,\" that he thought proposing termination was another way for the government to \"shirk its responsibility to a people who owned the entire continent of North America when the white man first invaded, not discovered, this country\".\n\nAfter eleven years as Choctaw chief, Belvin persuaded Representative Carl Albert of Oklahoma to introduce federal legislation to begin terminating the Choctaw tribe. What Belvin proposed was relief from the paternalistic watch of the BIA, which allowed the tribe to choose their own chiefs and handle tribal business and assets without federal supervision. On 23 April 1959, the BIA confirmed that H.R.2722, had been submitted to Congress at the request of the tribe, and would sell all remaining tribal assets, but would not effect any individual Choctaw earnings. It also provided for retention of 1/2 of all mineral rights which could be managed by a tribal corporation.\n\nOn 25 August 1959, Congress passed a bill to terminate the tribe, which was later called \"Belvin's law,\" as he was the main advocate behind it. Belvin created overwhelming support for termination among tribespeople through his promotion of the bill, describing the process and expected outcomes. What Belvin envisioned was that the high unemployment and poverty which existed in the nation, would be offset by the per capita payment that tribe members would receive from liquidation of the tribal assets. Tribal members later interviewed said that Belvin never used the word \"termination\" for what he was describing, and many people were unaware he was proposing termination. In actuality, the provisions of the bill were intended to be a final disposition of all trust obligations and a final \"dissolution of the tribal governments.\" Belvin claimed that he was misled and that the BIA did not pass the legislation the Choctaw proposed, as it did affect individual Choctaws and the relationships they had with the government and programs.\n\nThe original Act was to have expired in 1962, but was amended twice to allow more time to sell the tribal assets. As time wore on, Belvin realized that the bill severed the tribe members' access to government loans and other services, including the tribal tax exemption. By 1967, he had asked Oklahoma Congressman Ed Edmondson to try to repeal the termination act. Belvin's views were not just contained in private letters. In a 1967 newspaper account, he stated that the tribe needed to determine whether to outright repeal the 1959 Choctaw Termination Act or whether they wanted to form a tribal corporation to manage tribal affairs without supervision of the federal government. In addition, both Oklahomans, House Majority Leader Carl Albert and Senator Fred R. Harris, as well as Louis R. Bruce, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, were in support of the Choctaw request to kill the bill.\n\nBy the late 1960s public sentiment was changing as well. The Choctaw people had seen what termination could do to tribes, since they witnessed the process with four other tribes in Oklahoma: the Wyandotte Nation, Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma, and Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma. In 1969, ten years after passage of the Choctaw termination bill and one year before the Choctaws were to be terminated, word spread throughout the tribe that Belvin's law was a termination bill. The Choctaw Youth Movement fought politically against the termination law and helped create a new sense of tribal pride, especially among younger generations. Congress finally repealed the law on August 24, 1970.\n\nIn 1969, one year before the termination bill was scheduled to go into effect (officially 25 August 1970) Jim Wade, son of Talihina's police chief, told Charles E. Brown, that the government was dissolving the Choctaw tribe. Alarmed, and believing that most Choctaw did not realize \"Belvin's law\" was a termination bill rather than a per capita payment bill, Brown began organizing other urban Choctaw, primarily in the Oklahoma City area. With a key group of organizers they began using kin networks to contact Choctaw relatives throughout the country and traditional Choctaw Nation to urge them to fight against termination and be proud of their Choctaw heritage. They printed a newsletter called \"Hello Choctaws\" and lobbied Congress and the BIA to stop termination. It is clear that the youth activists felt Belvin was in favor of termination and that he was a traitor to tribal objectives. It is equally clear that Belvin felt that activists were personally attacking him and that he scheduled meetings throughout the Choctaw Nation to justify his actions.\n\nIt is hard to judge the effectiveness of the Choctaw Youth Movement in actually overturning the termination legislation. Public sentiment was changing with the passage of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Supreme Court ruling in the Menominee Tribe v. United States decision and even President Lyndon B. Johnson was advocating for policy which \"ends the old debate about \"termination\" of Indian programs and stresses self-determination\". Belvin had been speaking publicly and pressing legislators to overturn the legislation for at least 2 years and he was a proponent of tribes having the autonomy to elect their own leadership. In those goals, he and the youth activists were not far apart, as, after stopping termination, one of the activist's primary goals was the ability to elect their own tribal chief. Activists saw the BIA appointment of their leadership as an infringement on their identity as a sovereign people.\n\nWhere Belvin and youth activists differed was that Belvin seemed to see the tribe as a simple corporate entity whose role was to manage tribal assets. Activists saw the tribe as a multifaceted organization which spurred community development and fostered Choctaw identity. What the movement did in unequivocal terms was foster pride in being Choctaw and brought about a rebirth in Choctaw nationalism.\n\nAs a teacher and educator, Belvin had on ongoing interest in furthering education for Native Americans. He participated in the 1956 American Indian Institute Conference at the University of Oklahoma and urged that education had to include teaching underprivileged Indians the skills necessary to earn a living. He acknowledged that while education would bring about economic change, for Indians to progress they \"could not neglect the culture and heritage\" that they had contributed to the country. Belvin agreed to serve on the Institute's planning committee for the following year.\n\nIn 1959, a dispute among the Mississippi Choctaw found Belvin encouraging support for a Choctaw high school in Mississippi. Victor Kaneubbe, a worker at a Baptist mission in Philadelphia, Mississippi was an Oklahoma Choctaw with a white wife and a mixed-blood daughter, who was unable to attend either the agency schools or white schools in Mississippi. Choctaw administrators refused to allow his daughter admittance and the Neshoba County School Board refused admittance as well. He brought the issue of racism to the fore and urged his missionary network to petition Congress for creation of a Choctaw high school. The adverse publicity enraged the Baptist community, and cost Kaneubbe his job, forcing him to transfer to the Navajo reservation. Kaneubbe left but the problem of inadequate education remained for eastern Choctaw. Appeals to the BIA resulted in responses that students could attend out of state boarding schools, thus squarely putting pressure on the eastern Choctaw to relocate or face lack of educational opportunity. Agitation from the National Congress of American Indians, the Mississippi Federation of Women's Clubs, Oklahoma Choctaw Chief Belvin, and other civil rights activists forced Mississippi's congressional delegation to request a high school and dormitory for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, though it took several more years of negotiation to make the high school become a reality.\n\nBelvin was acutely aware that his generation had been urged to learn English and not Choctaw, but claims that his father's encouragement to speak only English had caused Belvin to advocate for full assimilation and favor eliminating the study of Choctaw, are not born out by his work in education. Belvin remained involved with his alma mater, Southeastern State College (now Southeastern Oklahoma State University) in Durant. Around 1969, with Belvin and other educators' full support and input, the college began a Bilingual Education Program, which was sponsored by a grant from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare National Institute of Education. The program targeted four elementary schools in the heart of Choctaw country, Battiest, Broken Bow, Smithville and Wright City in McCurtain County, Oklahoma. The program, as designed had 3 principal goals, all aimed at mainstreaming the student without sacrificing his/her native identity:\n\n\nThe program continued until around 1982, when federal funding initiatives were cut.\n\nIn 1955, the Indian Health Service was transferred from the administration of the BIA to the Public Health Service, which resulted in an almost immediate improvement in funding, training and services. At that time, the Talihina Indian Hospital (now known as the Choctaw Nation Health Care Center) was designated as the Public Health Service Indian Hospital and was the chief facility in Oklahoma providing comprehensive, preventative and other treatment services for the Choctaw. Belvin worked with Floyd Gale Anderson, the first full-blood Indian to hold the position of Service Unit Director, to expand the Choctaw health system. Under their tutelage, to make health care more accessible, satellite clinics were opened in Broken Bow, Hugo and McAlester.\n\nAlso during Belvin's term, in 1969. the Choctaw Nation created a Community Health Representative Program to help those Indians residing within the tribal service area of the Choctaw Nation boundaries to maintain health for their families. The program targets people who predominantly reside in rural settings and may not be near medical facilities and assists them with health checks, monitoring health issues, nutritional needs, education, and referral services.\n\nIn the 1960s as part of the War on Poverty programs introduced by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Belvin submitted an application to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to create a tribal housing authority. He realized that Federal programs administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs were aimed primarily at reservation communities, and the unique status of Oklahoma tribes without extensive land bases, meant that many programs designed for Indians did not benefit the Five Civilized Tribes. He further had become aware that programs which the BIA had offered for loans, had evaporated with the enactment of the termination bill. HUD denied Belvin's application based on various reasons, but included that the Choctaw were not policing tribal lands. In 1966, he then resubmitted the application under the requirements for a state agency, rather than a tribal authority, and designated himself, as chief, with the powers vested in a mayor for the purposes of the Act. According to the state requirements, a 5-person board of commissioners was appointed to oversee the housing authority.\n\nBy 1971, 364 homes designed for low-income Indian families to purchase or rehabilitate housing and 116 units of low-rent housing had been finished, with an additional 274 homes under construction. By 1973, 885 houses had been completed and were occupied and an additional 331 were under construction.\n\nOn 22 October 1970, the US Congress passed an Act (84 Stat. 1091) authorizing each of the Five Civilized Tribes to popularly elect their Principal Chief. The BIA selected an election committee of eight Choctaws to determine who would be eligible to vote in the first free election since the Dawes Act. The committee decided \"to permit all lineal descendants of Choctaw by blood Dawes enrollees to vote,\" which resulted in about 25% of the ballots being from absentee voters. Though Belvin won the election, it would be his last term as chief. His efforts at rebuilding the tribal structure were seen as insignificant and not aggressive enough, his failure to define membership procedures to admit unenrolled descendants of enrolled\nmembers, and his lack of planning to develop the tribe led to his defeat in 1975.\n\n\nOn December 21, 1922, in Boswell, Oklahoma, Belvin married Lucille Brightwell (25 June 1903 - 24 August 1991). They had one child, Louise Belvin Frazier.\nBelvin was an elder in the Presbyterian Church.\n\nHe died 19 September 1986 in Bryan Memorial Hospital and was buried in Highland Cemetery, Durant, Oklahoma.\n"}

He was Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at Oxford from 1977 to 1985, and died there.\n\nBull was born in Sydney, Australia, where he attended Fort Street High School. He went on to study history and philosophy at the University of Sydney, where he was strongly influenced by the philosopher John Anderson. In 1953, Bull left Australia to study politics at Oxford, and after two years he was appointed to an assistant lectureship in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).\n\nIn 1965, Bull was appointed director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Unit of the British Foreign Office, forfeiting his Australian identity for British citizenship. Two years later, in 1967, he was appointed to a professorship of international relations at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra.\n\nIn 1977, Bull published his main work, \"The Anarchical Society\". It is widely regarded as a key textbook in the field of international relations and is also seen as the central text in the so-called 'English School' of international relations. In this book, he argues that despite the anarchical character of the international arena, it is characterised by the formation of not only a system of states, but a society of states. His requirements for an entity to be called a state are that it must claim sovereignty over (i) a group of people (ii) a defined territory, and that it must have a government. States form a system when they have a sufficient degree of interaction, and impact on each other's decisions, so as they \"behave — at least in some measure — as parts of a whole.\" A system of states can exist without it also being a society of states. A society of states comes into existence \"when a group of states, conscious of certain common interests and common values, form a society in the sense that they conceive themselves to be bound by a common set of rules in their relations with one another, and share in the working of common institutions.\"\n\nThe society of states is a way for Bull to analyse and assess possibilities of order in world politics. He continues his argument by giving the concept of order in social life, and the mechanisms of: the balance of power, international law, diplomacy, war and the great powers central roles. He finally concludes that, despite the existence of possible alternative forms of organization, the states system is our best chance of achieving order in world politics.\n\n\nThere is a comprehensive bibliography of Hedley Bull's works (prepared by Donald Markwell) in \n\n\n"}

He grew up as his uncle's ward and worked briefly as an engineer. After his uncle's death, Sullivan became active in charitable work. He was co-author of a 1927 biography of Arthur Sullivan, well regarded in its day, but later discredited because of its suppression of the composer's diary entries that mentioned his gambling and philandering.\n\nSullivan inherited many of his uncle's papers and original music manuscripts. Sullivan left most of these to his wife, who died in 1957, and they finally were sold to collectors in 1966.\n\nHerbert Sullivan was the third child and eldest son of Frederic and Charlotte Sullivan, one of eight siblings. When Fred Sullivan died aged 39 in 1877, his younger brother, the composer Arthur Sullivan, made himself responsible for the support of Fred's widow and eight children. In 1881, Charlotte married Captain Benjamin Hutchinson, a man 13 years her junior. Charlotte emigrated to the US in 1883 with her husband and all her children except Herbert, who remained in England under the care of his uncle. At the age of nine, Sullivan began boarding school in Brighton, England. He studied in Germany in the autumn of 1884.\n\nArthur Sullivan's health was precarious from the 1880s onwards, and Herbert often accompanied his uncle to the South of France and other resorts where the composer rested or spent holidays. In late 1890, at 22 years of age, Herbert left his uncle's home for an engineering job connected with the laying of a cable between Haiti and Brazil. Herbert soon returned to England, and he continued to spend much of his time with his uncle, continuing as his companion at the theatre and on trips. Though never formally adopted, Herbert was in many respects Arthur Sullivan's adopted son. He was at his uncle's bedside at his death in 1900. When Arthur died, the German Emperor Wilhelm, an admirer of Sullivan's works, sent Herbert a personal message of condolence. Herbert remained friendly with his uncle's collaborator, W. S. Gilbert, after Arthur's death; when Herbert organised a Garrick Club dinner in 1908, in honour of Gilbert, the dramatist wrote, \"My dear Sullivan, There is little need to tell you how deeply I appreciate the good feeling that actuated you in organizing yesterday's most successful dinner. It is an instance of friendship that can never fade from my memory\".\nAfter his uncle's death, Herbert Sullivan inherited the bulk of the composer's estate, including his diaries and many of his important musical manuscripts. He became prominent in \"pro bono publico\" activities, and in April 1915 he contributed the manuscript of \"Utopia Limited\" by Gilbert and Sullivan to a charity auction in aid of the Red Cross. During the First World War, Herbert became a King's Messenger. While in this service, his ship was hit by a torpedo, and he spent hours in the freezing waters of the North Sea. Afterwards, he found walking painful and used a cane. While on his yacht \"Zola\", in 1921, he retrieved mail from the English Channel after an aeroplane crash. In 1923 he married Elena Margarita Vincent. He served as Warden of the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1925 and as Master of the Company in 1926.\n\nIn 1927 Sullivan collaborated with Newman Flower on a biography of Arthur Sullivan. As Sullivan and Flower had exclusive access to the composer's diaries, the biography was regarded at the time as uniquely authoritative. Subsequently, when wider access to the diaries became possible, it was seen that Sullivan had suppressed mention of his uncle's gambling and womanising, and this evasion, combined with the lack of musical analysis in the biography, led to a lowering of its status among scholars.\n\nHerbert Sullivan died suddenly in London in 1928, aged 60. His estate included many of his uncle's manuscripts. His widow remarried about 1929, becoming Mrs Elena M. Bashford. She died in 1957, and the manuscripts were sold at auction in 1966 by her estate, some going to museums and collectors in America and others remaining in England. Several of the autograph scores were bought by the Gilbert and Sullivan scholar and collector Dr Terence Rees and others by dealers.\n\n"}

Lindheim (1886–1978), born in New York, was a Zionist fund-raiser and educator. \n\nLindheim was born Irma Levy in New York City on December 9, 1886, to a German-Jewish family with roots in the American South. Her father, Robert Levy, was a business man, and her mother, Mathilda (née Morgenstern) stayed at home and raised Irma and her sisters, Amy and Edna. Though Lindheim would later attend a Jewish seminary, her early life at home was largely devoid of Jewish ritual; the family had Christmas trees in their home and declined to celebrate Jewish holidays. \n\nIrma, refusing to consent to her father's insistence that he choose her husband, married Norvin R. Lindheim in 1907, a young attorney and graduate of Johns Hopkins and Columbia University Law School. Together, they had five children, and when Irma's father died in 1914, she inherited a small fortune. \n\nShe served as the only Jewish female first lieutenant in the Motor Corps of America during World War I, starting in 1917. Around this time, Lindheim, inspired by an Ethical Culture teacher, decided to further educate herself on her Judaism. After visiting her husband's cousin in Baltimore, where she met American Zionists and Palestinian Jews, she decided to dedicate herself to Zionism. She began to lecture on the subject, and, recognizing her leadership potential, Henrietta Szold, head of the cultural division of the American Zionist Organization, named Lindehim to the chair of New York's Seventh Zionist District. There, she oversaw the creation of a cultural center, the opening of which was attended by prominent Zionist and United States Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. Though the center was initially successful, a dispute between Brandeis and Chaim Weizmann at the 1921 Zionist Convention led to the closing of the center. \n\nIn 1922 she entered the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York City, becoming the first woman in the U.S. to attend a Jewish seminary. As the first female student of the Institute, she was relegated to special student status. In 1923, she petitioned the faculty to change her status from that of special student to a regular student in the rabbinic program; in response, in May of that year they unanimously recommended the admission of women to the Institute on the same basis as men. However, in 1925, she decided to drop her studies and traveled to Palestine. \n\nDuring her visit (later described in her book, \"The Immortal Adventure\", published in 1928), Lindehim was able to attend the opening ceremony of Hebrew University and was introduced to Manya Shohat, who would later become a lifelong friend. Shoat helped Lindheim tour the country, taking her to the kibbutz she called home, K'far Giladi. After touring the Negev, Lindheim was newly energized for the Zionist cause.\n\nAfter a short period of fundraising, Lindheim became the second president of Hadassah, in 1926. At the time, the Zionist Organization of America, then-president Louis Lipsky was pressuring Hadassah to give up their autonomy and fold into the ZOA. Lindheim fought against that pressure and eventually succeeded, was re-elected president in 1927, and served as Hadassah's delegate to the World Zionist Congress in Basel. When she returned, she joined the Labor Zionist Poale Zion, prompting the Hadassah board to demand her resignation on the grounds of conflict of interest. Lindheim resigned her post and began to raise funds for Histadrut and Hashomer Hatzair, organizations that defined themselves as further left than Hadassah.\n\nIn March 1933, Lindheim moved to Palestine with her children (Norvin had died in 1928) and attempted to found a Histadrut-funded clearing house for new immigrants. Finding this unfulfilling, she moved to Kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek. At 47, she was about 25 years older than the average kibbutz member. \n\nDuring World War II, she was drafted by Keren Kayemet to solicit funding for Zionist causes in England. She also remained active in prodding Hadassah during this time, petitioning them to increase their work with the Zionist youth movement. Briefly moving back to America, she mounted an unsuccessful congressional campaign as candidate for the American Labor Party in Queens, New York, in 1948 (when she appeared at rallies for Progressive presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace and ran with Brooklyn ALP candidate Lee Pressman), sending her back to what was now Israel. \nThere, she helped to create Kibbutz Adamit and Kibbutz Ein HaShofet. \"Shofet\", which means \"judge\" in Hebrew, was chosen to honor Louis Brandeis. Dubbed the \"grandmother of the kibbutz\" by the Israeli press, she moved back to the U.S. in the mid-60's, continuing to write articles and essays for Zionist publications. \n\nIn 1962 she published her autobiography \"Parallel Quest: A Search of a Person and a People\".\n\nLindheim died on April 10, 1978, in Berkeley, California.\n\nLindheim, Irma (1928) \"The Immortal Adventure.\" The Macauley Company\n\nLindheim, Irma (1962) \"Parallel Quest: A Search of a Person and People\".

{"id": "242911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242911", "title": "Jack Nicklaus", "text": "Jack Nicklaus\n\nJack William Nicklaus (born January 21, 1940), nicknamed The Golden Bear, is an American retired professional golfer. Many observers regard him as the greatest golfer of all time. During a span of more than 25 years, he won a record 18 major championships while producing 19 second-place and 9 third-place finishes. Nicklaus focused on the major championships—Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship—and played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (80).\n\nNicklaus won the U.S. Amateur in 1959 and 1961 and challenged for the 1960 U.S. Open, where he finished in second place, two shots behind Arnold Palmer. Nicklaus turned professional at age 21 toward the end of 1961. He earned his first professional win at the 1962 U.S. Open, when he defeated Palmer by three shots in a next day 18-hole playoff. This win over Palmer began the on-course rivalry between the two golf superstars. In 1966, Nicklaus won the Masters Tournament for the second year in a row, becoming the first golfer to achieve this distinction, and also won The Open Championship, completing his career slam of major championships. At age 26, he became the youngest to do so at the time. He won another Open Championship in 1970.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1980, he won an additional nine major championships, overtook Bobby Jones' record of 13 majors, and became the first player to complete double and triple career slams of golf's four professional major championships. When Nicklaus claimed his 18th and final major championship at age 46 at the 1986 Masters, he became the tournament's oldest winner. Nicklaus joined the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the PGA Tour Champions) when he became eligible in January 1990, and by April 1996 had won 10 tournaments, including eight major championships despite playing a very limited schedule. He continued to play at least some of the four regular Tour majors until 2005, when he made his final appearances at the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship.\n\nNicklaus has also taken part in various other activities, including golf course design, charity work and book writing. He is a member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects and has helped design courses such as Harbour Town Golf Links. Nicklaus also runs his own tournament on the PGA Tour, the Memorial Tournament. His golf course design company is one of the largest in the world. Nicklaus' books vary from instructional to autobiographical, with his \"Golf My Way\" considered one of the best instructional golf books of all time; the video of the same name is the best selling golf instructional to date.\n\nNicklaus was born in Columbus, Ohio and grew up in the suburb of Upper Arlington. He is of German descent, the son of Helen (Schoener) (1909–2000) and Charlie Nicklaus (1913–1970), a pharmacist who ran several businesses named Nicklaus Drug Store. Charlie was a skilled all-round athlete who had played football for the Ohio State Buckeyes and had gone on to play semi-professional football under an assumed name for the Portsmouth Spartans (who later became the NFL's Detroit Lions). Charlie had also been a scratch golfer and local tennis champion in his youth. Charlie Nicklaus died of pancreatic cancer at age fifty six.\n\nNicklaus was raised in Upper Arlington and attended Upper Arlington High School, whose nickname and mascot are coincidentally the Golden Bears. In his senior year, Nicklaus was an honorable mention All-Ohio selection in basketball as a shooting guard, and he received some recruiting interest from college basketball programs, including Ohio State. During his youth, he also competed successfully in football, baseball, tennis, and track and field.\n\nNicklaus took up golf at the age of 10, scoring a 51 at Scioto Country Club for his first nine holes ever played. Charlie Nicklaus had joined Scioto that same year, returning to golf to help heal a volleyball injury. Jack Nicklaus was coached at Scioto by club pro Jack Grout, a Texas-developed contemporary of golf greats Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan; Grout had played quite successfully on the PGA Tour and would become Nicklaus' lifelong golf instructor. Nicklaus overcame a mild case of polio as a 13-year-old.\n\nNicklaus won the first of five straight Ohio State Junior titles at the age of 12. At 13, he broke 70 at Scioto Country Club for the first time, and became that year's youngest qualifier into the U.S. Junior Amateur, where he survived three match-play rounds. He had earned a handicap of +3 at age 13, the lowest in the Columbus area. Nicklaus won the Tri-State High School Championship (Ohio/Kentucky/Indiana) at the age of 14 with a round of 68, and also recorded his first hole-in-one in tournament play the same year. At 15, Nicklaus shot a 66 at Scioto Country Club, which was the amateur course record, and qualified for his first U.S. Amateur. He won the Ohio Open in 1956 at age 16, highlighted by a phenomenal third round of 64, competing against professionals. In all, Nicklaus won 27 events in the Ohio area from age 10 to age 17.\n\nIn 1957, Nicklaus won the International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament, having lost the previous year in a playoff. Nicklaus also competed in his first of 44 consecutive U.S. Opens that year, but missed the cut. In 1958 at age 18, he competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Rubber City Open, at Akron, Ohio, tying for 12th place after being just one out of the lead at the 36-hole mark, and made the cut in the U.S. Open, tying for 41st place. Nicklaus also won two Trans-Mississippi Amateurs – in 1958 at Prairie Dunes Country Club and 1959 at Woodhill Country Club, with final match victories of 9 & 8 and 3 & 2, respectively. Also in 1959, Nicklaus won the North and South Amateur at Pinehurst, North Carolina and competed in three additional PGA Tour events, with his best finish being another 12th place showing at the Buick Open.\n\nWhile attending Ohio State, he won the U.S. Amateur twice (1959, 1961), and an NCAA Championship (1961). In the 1959 U.S. Amateur, Nicklaus defeated two-time winner and defending champion Charles Coe 1-up in the final 36-hole match when he birdied the eighteenth hole. This was significant not only because of Coe's proven ability as a player, but also because Nicklaus became the then-youngest champion in the modern era, second only to Robert A. Gardner, who won in 1909. In 1961, Nicklaus became the first player to win the individual title at the NCAA Championship and the U.S. Amateur in the same year. He was followed by Phil Mickelson (1990), Tiger Woods (1996), Ryan Moore (2004), and Bryson DeChambeau (2015). Nicklaus also won the NCAA Big Ten Conference Championship that year with a 72-hole aggregate of 283, while earlier claiming the Western Amateur in New Orleans. In his second and last U.S. Amateur win in 1961, Nicklaus convincingly defeated Dudley Wysong 8 & 6 at Pebble Beach in the 36-hole championship match. For the week, Nicklaus was 20 strokes under par, including 34 birdies and two eagles.\n\nAt the 1960 U.S. Open, twenty-year-old Nicklaus shot a two-under par 282, finishing in second place two strokes behind Arnold Palmer, who won the tournament for the only time with a final round charge of six-under-par 65. This score remains the lowest ever by an amateur in the U.S. Open. Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with Ben Hogan, who later remarked that he had just played 36 holes with a kid who should have won by 10 shots. During the final 36 holes, Nicklaus was two-under-par; he had shot every round of the tournament at or below par and was the only entrant to do so. Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play. In 1960, Nicklaus also tied for 13th in the Masters Tournament. He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par. Each of these three major championship finishes designated Nicklaus as low amateur. However, Nicklaus' one-under-par 287 tied for seventh in the 1961 Masters Tournament, and was second that year only to Charles Coe's low amateur placing, when he tied for second with Arnold Palmer at seven-under par 281, one shot behind champion Gary Player.\n\nNicklaus represented the United States against Great Britain and Ireland on winning Walker Cup teams in both 1959 and 1961, decisively winning both of his matches in each contest. On the 1959 trip to Britain, he also made his only attempt at the British Amateur, the world's oldest international amateur event, at Royal St George's Golf Club, reaching the quarterfinal round (top 8). He was also a member of the victorious 1960 U.S. Eisenhower Trophy team, winning the unofficial individual title by 13 shots over teammate Deane Beman with a four-round score of 269, a record which still stands; this score was 18 shots lower than Ben Hogan's earlier U.S. Open aggregate of 287 at the same site (which had, however, been scored under much tougher conditions). For three straight years (1959–1961), Nicklaus was named the world's top amateur golfer by \"Golf Digest\" magazine.\n\nNicklaus attended Ohio State from 1957 to 1961. He majored in pre-pharmacy and had good grades in his first three years; he intended to follow his father into pharmacy after graduation. As his amateur golf achievements mounted, Nicklaus changed his mind on his career path; he switched programs to study insurance. At that stage, he planned to remain an amateur golfer and earn his living by selling insurance. For a time, he worked in the insurance field while he also attended college. He married Barbara Bash (b. 1940), who was a nursing student at Ohio State, in July 1960, and their first of five children, Jack Jr., was born in September 1961, but the following month, Nicklaus was still intent on becoming the first amateur to win the Masters. In early November, he changed his mind and announced that he was turning professional in order to support his family. He wound up a few course hours short of graduating from college. In a goodwill gesture, Ohio State granted him an honorary doctorate in 1972.\n\nNicklaus began his career on the PGA Tour in 1962. While Nicklaus officially turned professional in late 1961, he heavily debated the idea of remaining an amateur in order to further emulate his idol, Bobby Jones. However, Nicklaus realized that in order to be regarded as the best, he would have to compete in greater frequency against the best. Shortly after turning professional, Nicklaus' future agent, Mark McCormack, was interviewed by \"Melbourne Age\" writer Don Lawrence, who inquired about the American golf scene. When McCormack described Nicklaus, Lawrence referred to the \"large, strong, and blond\" player as \"the Golden Bear,\" a nickname that would become synonymous with Nicklaus throughout his professional life. However, another possible origination of the name derives from the high school that Nicklaus attended in Upper Arlington, Ohio, which uses the mascot the Golden Bears for its sports teams. As mentioned above, Nicklaus played on several Golden Bear athletic teams, including captaining its 1956 state-champion golf squad, suggesting that McCormack may have adopted the name through Nicklaus' high school affiliation. Regardless, by 1963, the nickname had stuck.\n\nNicklaus won his first PGA tournament in his 17th start, when he defeated Arnold Palmer in a Sunday playoff at Oakmont for the 1962 U.S. Open; Nicklaus earned $17,500 for his efforts. The galleries were more vocal in their support for Palmer—who had grown up in nearby Latrobe—but Nicklaus won the playoff by three shots (71 to 74). In 90 holes, Nicklaus had only one three-putt green. The U.S. Open victory made Nicklaus the reigning U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur champion. In addition, at age 22, Nicklaus was the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones won at age 21 in 1923, and he has remained the youngest winner since (John McDermott is still the youngest winner of the U.S. Open at age 19 in 1911). The U.S. Open win thrust Nicklaus into the national spotlight, and he was featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine. This was also the beginning of the Nicklaus-Palmer rivalry, which attracted viewers to golf on television.\n\nBy the end of 1962, Nicklaus had won two more tournaments, which were back-to-back in the Seattle Open and Portland Open. In addition, he tied for third in his first attempt at the PGA Championship. Nicklaus completed the year with over $60,000 in prize-money, made 26 of 26 cuts with 16 top-10 finishes, placed third on the PGA Tour money list, and was named Rookie of the Year. He also won the inaugural staging of the World Series of Golf, a select-field event for the year's major champions, and collected another $50,000 (unofficial money) for that win.\n\nIn 1963, Nicklaus won two of the four majors—the Masters and the PGA Championship. These victories made him the then-youngest winner of the Masters and third-youngest winner of the PGA Championship, and each win came in just his second year as a professional. Earlier in 1963, Nicklaus injured his left hip playing an approach shot from the rough—an injury that would manifest itself years later. Ironically, Nicklaus credits this injury with assisting him in altering his swing heading into the 1963 Masters, thus allowing him to play a draw more easily. Along with three other wins including the Tournament of Champions, he placed second to Arnold Palmer on the PGA Tour money list with just over $100,000. He also teamed with Palmer to win the Canada Cup (now the World Cup of Golf) in France, representing the United States (this event was shortened to 63 holes due to heavy fog). Nicklaus also finished as low individual scorer for that event.\n\nNicklaus' meteoric rise to fame immediately after turning professional brought opportunities for him to earn significant endorsement income. These business opportunities were facilitated by Mark McCormack, who also managed Palmer and Gary Player. Golf was growing rapidly in popularity and media coverage during the early 1960s, led by the performances of these three star players. Palmer's charging style and popularity with the galleries made him the world's most marketable sports figure. This association was the start of the agency that became known as International Management Group, and IMG, after building a base in golf management, eventually expanded into other sports. The Palmer-Nicklaus-Player rivalry developed into the so-called \"Big Three\" of Golf. McCormack set up a series of televised golf matches around the world amongst the three stars, known as Big Three Golf, in the early 1960s. Nicklaus left IMG in the early 1970s, to set up his own management agency, Golden Bear Inc.\n\nDespite winning no majors in 1964 (he had three runner-up finishes), Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list for the first time in his career by a slim margin of $81.13 over Palmer. At The Open Championship at St Andrews, Nicklaus set a new record for the lowest score in the final 36 holes with 66-68 in high winds (the first time in the championship's history that 70 had been broken in each of the last two rounds). This was not enough, however, to win the event; Nicklaus placed second to Tony Lema. Nicklaus also set a record for the lowest final round score in the PGA Championship with a 64 (since broken by Brad Faxon in 1995 with a 63), but fell three shots short of champion Bobby Nichols and his record-setting 271 score. In 31 official worldwide events in 1964, Nicklaus achieved six victories, seven runners-up, placed in the top-five 21 times, the top-10 21 times, and had only one missed cut. Nicklaus and Palmer also defended their team title at the World Cup in Hawaii, with Nicklaus again finishing as low individual scorer.\n\nWhen Nicklaus won the Masters in 1965 and 1966, he became the tournament's first back-to-back winner and the youngest two-time and three-time winner. He broke Ben Hogan's 72-hole scoring record of 274 in 1953 when he compiled a new aggregate of 271 in the 1965 Masters Tournament. This record was tied by Raymond Floyd in 1976 and lasted until Tiger Woods shot 270 in 1997, which was a 72-hole record that was subsequently tied by Jordan Spieth in 2015. When Woods and Spieth shot 270, the scores were achieved with significantly improved golf equipment on essentially the same-length golf course over which Nicklaus and Floyd shot 271. During the 1965 tournament, Nicklaus hit 62 of 72 greens in regulation and had 123 putts, inclusive of just one three-putt green. This was good enough to win by nine shots over Arnold Palmer and Gary Player; this margin of victory was a tournament record that would last for 32 years until Woods won by 12 shots in 1997. The week's performance was highlighted by a third-round 64 that consisted of eight birdies and no bogeys. It was of this round that Nicklaus said, \"I had never before and have never since played quite as fine a complete round of golf in a major championship as I did in the third round of the 1965 Masters\". This round tied Lloyd Mangrum's record set in 1940 at Augusta National and remained in place until Nick Price shot 63 during the third round in 1986. It was at this time that Bobby Jones stated Nicklaus played a game with which he was unfamiliar; Jones called Nicklaus' result \"the greatest performance in all of golfing history.\"\n\nAfter Nicklaus' record performance at Augusta National in 1965, the course underwent some minor changes to make it tougher. These modifications and the difficult weather in the 1966 tournament did not deter Nicklaus. He successfully defended his title with an even-par aggregate of 288, 17 shots higher. He won in an 18-hole playoff over Gay Brewer (Brewer had three-putted the 18th green to force the playoff) and Tommy Jacobs by shooting a two-under-par 70. Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list again in 1965 by a healthy margin over Tony Lema. Nicklaus and Lema formed the U.S. team for the World Cup, held in Madrid, Spain, but could not defend the title, as South Africa won. In all, Nicklaus competed in 28 official worldwide events in 1965, accumulating five victories, seven runners-up, 19 top-5 finishes, 23 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.\n\nIn 1966, Nicklaus also won The Open Championship at Muirfield in Scotland under difficult weather conditions; he used his driver just 17 times because of very heavy rough. This was the only major he had failed to win up to that point. This win made him the youngest player, age 26 (his fifth year on Tour), and the only one after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, and Gary Player (until Tiger Woods at age 24 in 2000, also during his fifth year on Tour) to win all four major championships, now known as the Career Slam. Nicklaus eventually accomplished the double career slam in 1971 and the triple career slam in 1978, winning all four majors two and three times, respectively. Nicklaus was part of another title for the U.S. in the World Cup in Japan. Nicklaus concluded 1966 playing 22 official worldwide events, with four victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.\n\nIn 1967, Nicklaus won the U.S. Open for a second time. The tournament was held at Baltusrol, and he broke Hogan's 72-hole record by one shot with a 275 when he birdied the par 5 18th hole. During the four rounds, Nicklaus hit 61 of 72 greens in regulation. Nicklaus finished this record win with a dramatic 238-yard 1-iron shot, uphill into a breeze and light rain, to the 72nd green (an approximate 260-yard equivalent) and holing a birdie putt to close out a final nine of 30 and final round of 65 to beat Arnold Palmer by four shots. Nicklaus and Palmer were the only two players to break par for the week. \"Sports Illustrated\" ran a cover photo of Nicklaus throwing his leg high in the air with the headline, \"Nicklaus Breaks the Open Record.\" He also finished runner up in The Open Championship and third in the PGA Championship, one shot out of a playoff between Don January and Don Massengale. In 1967, Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list for the third time. Later that year, Nicklaus and Palmer teamed up for a 13-shot wire-to-wire World Cup victory in Mexico City. Nicklaus competed in 24 official worldwide events in 1967, with five victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and one missed cut. For most of his professional career, Nicklaus employed Angelo Argea as his caddie.\n\nAfter Nicklaus won the 1967 U.S. Open in record breaking fashion, he did not win another major championship until the 1970 Open Championship at the Old Course at St Andrews. Moreover, his highest finish on the Tour money list for the years 1968–70 was second; his lowest was fourth, his worst ranking on the list since turning professional. However, it should be noted that his fourth-place ranking in 1970 would have been elevated to second if The Open Championship winnings were included during that period in the official PGA Tour money list, as they are today. Nicklaus finished runner-up in both the 1968 U.S. Open (to new rival Lee Trevino) and the 1968 Open Championship (to old rival Gary Player).\n\nNicklaus did not make his inaugural appearance in the Ryder Cup until 1969 at age 29; eligibility rules at the time required a minimum five-year PGA Tour membership before points could be counted for team qualification; rules have been relaxed significantly since. In the 1969 Ryder Cup, the entire competition came down to the anchor singles match between Nicklaus and Tony Jacklin. At the par-5 17th hole with Nicklaus leading by the score of 1 up, Jacklin made a eagle putt to square the match. With the entire competition outcome riding on this match, Nicklaus made a five-foot par putt on the last hole before controversially conceding Jacklin's par putt, ensuring that this game, and the overall match, ended in a tie. Afterwards United States team Captain Sam Snead said \"This is the greatest golf match you have ever seen in England\".\n\nDuring this period, Nicklaus' physical condition declined somewhat; he put on some excess weight, which affected his stamina. Following the Ryder Cup, he significantly improved his condition in the fall of 1969 by losing in one month, and his game started to return to top form. In February 1970, Nicklaus' father, Charlie Nicklaus, died. Five months after this, Nicklaus won the 1970 Open Championship under difficult scoring conditions in Scotland where the wind howled up to 56 MPH, defeating fellow American Doug Sanders in an 18-hole playoff round in emotional fashion. On the 18th hole of the playoff, Nicklaus drove about 380 yards, through the par-4 green with a three-wood, and was forced to pitch back to the hole. His eagle pitch finished approximately eight feet short of the hole. Nicklaus threw his putter into the air after sinking the winning putt, as he was thrilled to have won the Open at the home of golf, St Andrews. He describes this period in his life:\nI was playing good golf, but it really wasn't that big a deal to me one way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of realized that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint. ... It was a big boost.\nNicklaus also went on to capture the Piccadilly World Match Play Championship in 1970 with a 2 & 1 win over Lee Trevino in the championship match. In all for the year, Nicklaus competed in 23 official worldwide events, won four, placed in the top-5 10 times, and the top-10 in 14.\n\nAlthough Nicklaus' performance had declined somewhat during this period, he was still ranked as the #1 player in the world, for 10 straight years, beginning in 1968, on the McCormack's World Golf Rankings, which were introduced that year by sports agent Mark McCormack. These rankings, the first attempt to take into account results from professional tours around the world, were not official during that era, but they eventually evolved into the current Official World Golf Ranking, starting in 1986.\n\nWith his win in the 1971 PGA Championship, Nicklaus became the first golfer to win all four majors twice. In this championship, Nicklaus was the only player to break 70 consecutively in the first two rounds under windy conditions; he finished at seven-under par 281. Nicklaus finished second twice and fifth in the remaining three major championships for the year. While he finished tied for second in the Masters with Johnny Miller, Nicklaus made a big enough impression on a young Nick Faldo (watching on TV in England) in order for Faldo to take up the game seriously.\n\nBy the end of 1971, Nicklaus had won four additional PGA tournaments including the Tournament of Champions by eight shots and the National Team Championship with Arnold Palmer by six shots. With $244,490 in official PGA Tour earnings, Nicklaus established a new single-season money record during the year. Nicklaus also claimed his third World Cup individual title in 1971, with help from a 63 in the third round. He also won the team competition with partner Lee Trevino by 12 shots. The year 1971 brought Nicklaus a victory in the Australian Dunlop International as well, punctuated by a course record 62 (his career low score in competition; one of three) in the second round. For the record, Nicklaus played in 23 official worldwide events in 1971, won eight, had 17 top-5 finishes, 20 top-10 finishes, and compiled a 5–1–0 record in that year's Ryder Cup competition.\n\nNicklaus won the first two major championships of 1972 by three shots each in wire-to-wire fashion. He won the Masters and the U.S. Open, creating talk of a calendar-year Grand Slam. Nicklaus opened with a four-under-par 68 at Augusta National and never looked back. He was the only player under par for the week as he and the field battled difficult scoring conditions. In the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach again under severe scoring conditions, Nicklaus struck a one-iron on the 218-yard par-three 17th hole during the final round into a stiff, gusty ocean breeze that hit the flagstick and ended up three inches from the cup. The U.S. Open was Nicklaus' 13th career major and tied him with Bobby Jones for career majors (although a different group of tournaments had been considered majors in Jones's time). This victory was also Nicklaus' 11th professional major, tying him with Walter Hagen, and made him the first player to win the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open championships on the same golf course.\n\nDuring the 1972 PGA Tour season, Nicklaus won seven tournaments and was runner-up in three events. However, Nicklaus did not win the Grand Slam that year, as Lee Trevino repeated as the Open Championship winner (Nicklaus finished second, one shot behind), and Gary Player prevailed in the PGA Championship. Nicklaus closed out this remarkable year with a second of three consecutive Walt Disney World Golf Classic victories by shooting a 21-under par 267 to win by nine shots. He concluded 1972 by competing in 20 official worldwide events winning seven, placing second in four, and compiling 15 top-10 finishes.\n\nBobby Jones' record of majors was soon broken when Nicklaus won the PGA Championship in August 1973 by four shots over Bruce Crampton for his 12th professional major (surpassing Hagen's mark of 11) and 14th overall when using the old-style configuration of Jones' day. In that year he won another six tournaments. When he won the 1973 Ohio King's Island Open, he became the first PGA Tour player to win a Tour event on a course that he designed himself. The PGA Player of the Year was awarded to Nicklaus for the third time, and the second year in a row. Nicklaus was also the first player to win over $300,000.00 in official money for a single season in 1972 at $320,542; he eclipsed that threshold again the following year with $308,362. The former total was $106,137 more than runner-up Lee Trevino. The latter total for the year 1973 catapulted Nicklaus over the $2 million career PGA Tour earnings mark, making him the first player to reach that milestone. Nicklaus teamed with Johnny Miller for another team title in the World Cup of Golf, held in Spain. For the year, Nicklaus competed in 20 official worldwide events and claimed seven victories, 14 top-five finishes, 17 top-10s, and compiled a 4–1–1 record in that year's Ryder Cup competition.\n\nNicklaus' failure to win a major in 1974 was somewhat offset when he won the inaugural Tournament Players Championship and was named one of the 13 original inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame. Nicklaus said this honor was a \"nice memento\" after a \"disappointing season\". Although he had no major championship victories in 1974, Nicklaus still achieved four top-10 finishes in the four events, three of which were in the top four, and placed second on the official money list behind Johnny Miller. While less than a stellar year, Nicklaus was able to claim two victories and 13 top-10 finishes in 20 official worldwide events.\n\nNicklaus started off well in 1975: he won the Doral-Eastern Open, the Sea Pines Heritage Classic, and the Masters in consecutive starts. His Masters win was his fifth, a record he was to break eleven years later. In this tournament, Nicklaus's birdie putt on the 16th hole of the final round was a key in his victory over Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller in a riveting final-round battle. He also won the PGA Championship in August at Firestone Country Club by two shots over Bruce Crampton for his fourth win. Having won the Masters and PGA Championship, Nicklaus missed a playoff for the U.S. Open by two shots and a playoff for Open Championship by one shot. His performance in 1975 resulted in his being named PGA Player of the Year for the fourth time, tying Ben Hogan, and he was also named ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year. Nicklaus also captured his fourth Australian Open during the year. The year 1975 yielded Nicklaus six wins, 12 top-5 finishes, and 16 top-10 finishes in 18 official worldwide events.\n\nNicklaus placed first on the PGA Tour money list again in 1976, despite competing in only 16 events, winning just two (Tournament Players Championship and World Series of Golf) – neither of them majors – and playing what he called \"hang-back-and-hope golf\". The 1976 Tournament Players Championship saw Nicklaus set a championship record of 19-under par 269 for his second win in this event which remained in place until Greg Norman's 24-under-par 264 assault in 1994. He also won the PGA Player of the Year award for a record fifth time. Between 1972 and 1976 the only time he failed to win this award was 1974. The year 1976 also concluded an official streak of 105 consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour (ending at the World Open), which began for Nicklaus in 1970. At the time this streak was second only to Byron Nelson's record of 113.\n\nThe following year, 1977, was also majorless for Nicklaus, but he did achieve four top-10 finishes in the four events inclusive of two second and one third-place finish – this being one shot out of the PGA Championship playoff between Lanny Wadkins and Gene Littler. Despite a brilliant final round 66 at the Masters, he finished second by two shots to Tom Watson. But his subsequent second-place finish behind Watson at the Open Championship at Turnberry created headlines around the world. In a one-on-one battle dubbed the \"Duel in the Sun,\" Nicklaus shot 65-66 in the final two rounds, only to be beaten by Watson, who scored 65-65. This event marked the first time 270 was broken in a major championship, and the third-place finisher Hubert Green scored 279. Nicklaus would later say:\nThere are those in golf who would argue into next month that the final two rounds of the 1977 British Open were the greatest head-to-head golf match ever played. Not having been around for the first five hundred or so years of the game, I'm not qualified to speak on such matters. What's for sure, however, is that it was the most thrilling one-on-one battle of my career.\n\nIn 1977, Nicklaus won his 63rd tour event, passing Ben Hogan to take second place on the career wins list, behind only Sam Snead (subsequently Hogan's official career PGA Tour victory total was put at 64, including his 1953 Open Championship which was retroactively deemed an official PGA Tour event). He also became the first player to amass over $3 million in official PGA Tour earnings. The year also saw Nicklaus win for the first time his own Memorial Tournament, where he described the victory as the most emotional moment of his entire career, and nearly decided to retire from competitive golf.\n\nDuring the 1977 Ryder Cup at Royal Lytham & St Annes, Nicklaus approached the PGA of Great Britain about the urgency to improve the competitive level of the contest. The issue had been discussed earlier the same day by both past PGA of America President Henry Poe and British PGA President Lord Derby. Nicklaus pitched his ideas, adding: \"It is vital to widen the selection procedures if the Ryder Cup is to continue to enjoy its past prestige.\" The changes in team selection procedure were approved by descendants of the Samuel Ryder family, along with The PGA of America. The major change was expanding selection procedures to include players from the European Tournament Players' Division, and \"that European Members be entitled to play on the team.\" This meant that professional players on the European Tournament Players' Division, the forerunner to the European Tour we have today, from continental Europe would be eligible to play in the Ryder Cup.\n\nWhen Nicklaus won the 1978 Open Championship at St. Andrews, he became the only player to win each major championship three times. This record was tied by Tiger Woods when he won the 2008 U.S. Open. Nicklaus and Woods are the only two players to win three \"Career Grand Slams\". Nicklaus considered his performance in the 1978 Open as the finest four days of tee-to-green golf he had ever produced, and was most proud that the win came at St. Andrews, his favorite place to play golf. The victory was also his most emotional to date.\n\nNicklaus won three other tournaments on the PGA Tour in 1978. One of those wins came in the Jackie Gleason-Inverrary Classic, where he played the final 36 holes 13 under par and scored five consecutive birdies over the closing holes in the final round. He also won his third Tournament Players Championship in difficult weather conditions; he had won three of the first five stagings of that tournament, and he remains the championship's only three-time winner. He was named Sportsman of the Year by \"Sports Illustrated\". The year 1978 also marked Nicklaus' sixth and final Australian Open victory.\n\nIn 1979, Nicklaus suffered a lapse of form and did not win a tournament. This was the first year in his professional career in which he failed to win a PGA Tour event. He had only one runner-up finish, plus a tied-for-second with Ben Crenshaw behind 22-year-old Seve Ballesteros at The Open Championship. He would not win another tournament until June 1980. Previously, Nicklaus won at least one PGA Tour tournament per year (a record he shares with Arnold Palmer), and a minimum of two tournaments per year for 17 consecutive years, and this is another PGA Tour record.\n\nDuring the offseason, Nicklaus addressed two problems that had hurt his performance. His lifelong teacher Jack Grout noticed that he had become much too upright with his full swing, which caused a steep, oblique approach into the ball, compared with a more direct hit; this was corrected by slightly flattening his backswing. Then Nicklaus' short game, never a career strength, was further developed with the help of Phil Rodgers, a friend for more than 20 years, and earlier PGA Tour rival, who had become a fine coach. Rodgers lived for a time at the Nicklaus home while this work was going on.\n\nIn 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff. These victories and placements more than justified the work Nicklaus put in toward his game during the off-season.\n\nNicklaus set a new scoring record for the 1980 U.S. Open with an aggregate of 272, eclipsing his earlier record of 275 from 1967 over the same golf course. That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open. This was Nicklaus's second major win at Baltusrol Golf Club. Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki. Entering the final round, Aoki had caught Nicklaus after three consecutive rounds of 68, but over the course of the last day, Nicklaus pulled away by two shots. Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish. Aoki's aggregate of 274 was the lowest score for a U.S. Open runner-up. Nicklaus' win was his fourth and final victory in the championship, tying him with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan. Nicklaus referred to this win as \"by far the most emotional and warmest reaction to any of my wins in my own country\".\n\nIn the 1980 PGA Championship, Nicklaus set another record when he won the tournament by seven shots over Andy Bean at the Oak Hill Country Club; the win was largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 in the first round. This was followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and he was the only player to break par for 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus' fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with Walter Hagen for the most wins overall, since Hagen's victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus' seven-shot winning margin remained the largest for the stroke-play version of the championship until Rory's McIroy's 2012 victory. This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and Ben Hogan in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000).\n\nBetween 1981 and 1985, Nicklaus accumulated seven more top-10 placements in major championships, including three runner-up performances. He won only twice on the PGA Tour during this period, the Colonial National Invitation in 1982 and his own Memorial Tournament in 1984 for the second time, defeating Andy Bean in a sudden-death playoff to become the tournament's first repeat champion.\n\nIn 1983, Nicklaus closed out the PGA Championship and World Series of Golf with brilliant final rounds in the mid-60's, and passed many players to move into contention, but finished runner-up in each to Player of the Year Hal Sutton and Nick Price, respectively, who dominated the tournaments from start to finish. Despite not winning a PGA Tour event in 1983, Nicklaus finished 10th on the PGA Tour money list, and passed a significant milestone by becoming the first player to eclipse the $4 million level in career earnings.\n\nIn 1985, Nicklaus finished second to Curtis Strange in the Canadian Open, which marked his seventh and final second-place finish in that tournament; this is a record for that event. These seven runner-up finishes came over the course of 21 events—or one second-place finish for every three tournaments played—and does not include a third-place finish in 1983, one shot out of the playoff between John Cook and Johnny Miller.\n\nDuring the five-year period between 1981 and 1985, the Ryder Cup matches provided Nicklaus with two bright spots. He completed his competition as a player in style by contributing a perfect 4–0–0 record (inclusive of a 5 & 3 anchor singles match win over Eamonn Darcy) in 1981, and captained the United States team in 1983 to a one-point win over Europe.\n\nIn 1986, Nicklaus capped his major championship career by winning his sixth Masters title under challenging circumstances; he posted a six-under-par 30 on the back nine for a final round of seven-under-par 65. At the 17th hole, Nicklaus hit his second shot to within and rolled it in for birdie; he raised his putter in celebration and completed an eagle-birdie-birdie run. Nicklaus made a solid par-4 at the 72nd hole, and waited for the succeeding players, several of whom (Tom Kite, Greg Norman) were still in contention, to fall short. Nicklaus played the final ten holes seven under par, with six birdies and an eagle. At age 46, Nicklaus became the oldest Masters winner in history, a record that still stands. On the feat, sports columnist Thomas Boswell remarked,\nSome things cannot possibly happen, because they are both too improbable and too perfect. The U.S. hockey team cannot beat the Russians in the 1980 Olympics. Jack Nicklaus cannot shoot 65 to win The Masters at age 46. Nothing else comes immediately to mind.\nThis victory was his 18th and final major title as a professional.\n\nThis victory was to be his last in his long career on the PGA Tour, and was described at the time by noted golf historian and writer Herbert Warren Wind as \"nothing less than the most important accomplishment in golf since Bobby Jones' Grand Slam in 1930\".\n\nAuthor Ken Bowden wrote after the win:\nThere have been prettier swingers of the club than Jack Nicklaus. There may have been better ball-strikers than Jack Nicklaus. There have definitely been better short-game exponents than Jack Nicklaus. Other golfers have putted as well as Jack Nicklaus. There may have been golfers as dedicated and fiercely competitive as Jack Nicklaus. But no individual has been able to develop, combine and sustain all of the complex physical skills and the immense mental and emotional resources the game demands at its highest level as well as Jack Nicklaus has for as long as he has.\nAt the 1998 Masters, Nicklaus was 58 when he tied for sixth place despite being hampered by an ever-increasing painful left hip. Nicklaus' five-under par 283 is the lowest 72-hole score in the Masters by a player older than fifty.\n\nDuring the course of a 25-year span (1962–1986), Nicklaus won 18 major championships and finished second 18 times (excluding the second-place finish at the 1960 U.S. Open as an amateur). He also placed third nine times and fourth seven times in this span and was one stroke out of a playoff on five of those occasions (1963 Open Championship, 1967 PGA Championship, 1975 Open Championship, 1977 PGA Championship, and 1979 Masters Tournament). His total span of 73 top-10 finishes over 39 years (1960–1998) is a record in total number as well as longevity among the four major championships and encompassed his tenure from an amateur through the majority of his Champions Tour career.\n\nNicklaus became eligible to join the Senior PGA Tour, now known as PGA Tour Champions, when he turned 50 in January 1990, at which point he declared, \"I'm never satisfied. Trouble is, I want to play like me—and I can't play like me anymore.\" He then quickly won in his first start on the Tour, The Tradition, also a Senior Tour major championship. Nicklaus would go on to win another three Traditions—the final two in succession—while the most anyone else has won is two. \nLater in the year, Nicklaus won the Senior Players Championship by six shots over Lee Trevino for his second win of the year, and also his second major of the year by shooting a record 27-under par 261. The next year, in 1991, Nicklaus won three of the five events he started in, those being the U.S. Senior Open at Oakland Hills by firing a 65 in a playoff against Chi-Chi Rodríguez and his fine round of 69, the PGA Seniors Championship and The Tradition for the second year straight. These, again, were all majors on the senior circuit.\n\nNicklaus has won all the senior majors with the exception of the Senior Open Championship (also known as the Senior British Open). However, he never played in that event until after he turned 60, and it was only elevated to a major in 2003. After a winless year in 1992, Nicklaus came back to win the U.S. Senior Open for the second time in 1993 by one shot over Tom Weiskopf. Also in that year he teamed up with Chi-Chi Rodríguez and Raymond Floyd to win the Wendy's 3-Tour Challenge for the Senior PGA Tour team.\n\nIn 1994, Nicklaus won the Senior PGA Tour's version of the Mercedes Championship for his only win of the year. The Tradition was his again in 1995, in a year where he made the top 10 in all of the seven tournaments he entered in. His 100th career win came the next year, when he won the Tradition for the fourth time, and second time in succession. He made a double eagle in the final round. Nicklaus closed the final 36 holes with back-to-back seven-under par rounds of 65 to shoot a 16-under par 272 and win by three shots over Hale Irwin. This was to be his last win on the Senior PGA Tour, and the last official win of his career.\n\nIn 2000, Nicklaus played in his final U.S. Open. He shot 73-82 and missed the cut at Pebble Beach Golf Links. This was the same tournament where Tiger Woods won his first Open when he outclassed the nearest competitors by a 15-shot margin. Later in the year, he was paired with Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh in his final PGA Championship only a few days after the death of his 91-year-old mother, where he missed the cut by one shot. In both tournaments, Nicklaus provided last-minute heroics by reaching the par-5 18th in two shots in the U.S. Open and nearly holing his wedge shot for eagle at the par-5 18th in the PGA Championship.\n\nNicklaus played without much preparation in the 2005 Masters, a month after the drowning death of his 17-month-old grandson Jake (child of his son Steve) on March 1, 2005. In a written statement, Nicklaus said that it was impossible to put into words the devastation of his family. Nicklaus later spoke emotionally about the tragedy. He said: \"It's been an overwhelmingly difficult and trying time for my entire family. The loss of our precious 17-month-old grandson Jake was devastating.\" Nicklaus and his son Steve played golf as therapy for their grief following Jake's death. After days of playing, Steve suggested his father return to The Masters. He made that his last appearance in the tournament.\n\nLater in 2005, Nicklaus finished his professional career at The Open Championship played at St Andrews on July 15, 2005. On St Andrews, Nicklaus stated:\nI'm very sentimental and the place gets to me every time I go there. In May I walked around and welled up with hardly anyone watching me. St Andrews was always where I wanted to finish my major career.\nNicklaus turned 65 in January that year, which was the last year he could enter The Open Championship as an exempt player. He played with Luke Donald and Tom Watson in his final round. After hitting his tee shot off the 18th tee in the second round, Nicklaus received a ten-minute standing ovation from the crowd. On the eighteenth fairway, he gave his final farewell to professional golf while standing on the iconic Swilken Bridge. Soon afterwards, Nicklaus ended his career with a birdie, holing a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th green. Nicklaus missed the 36-hole cut with a score of +3 (147).\n\nThe last competitive tournament in which Nicklaus played in the United States was the Champions Tour's Bayer Advantage Classic in Overland Park, Kansas, on June 13, 2005.\n\nOn April 8, 2015, Nicklaus hit his first-ever hole-in-one at the Augusta National Golf Club at the age of 75 when participating in the Masters' Par 3 Contest, albeit on the Par 3 Course, while playing with Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw. He hit 20 holes-in-one in professional tournament play at other venues over his career.\n\nNicklaus devotes much of his time to golf course design and operates one of the largest golf design practices in the world. In the mid-1960s, Pete Dye initially requested Nicklaus' opinion in the architecture process of The Golf Club in suburban Columbus, Ohio, and the input increased from that point forward. Nicklaus considered golf course design another facet of the game that kept him involved and offered a challenge. His first design, Harbour Town Golf Links, co-credited with Dye, was opened for play in 1969. The nine-hole, par-3 golf course of Cheeca Resort & Spa was also designed by Nicklaus in the 1960s. A subsequent early, yet more prominent design was Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, OH which opened in 1974 and has hosted the Memorial Tournament since its inception in 1976. This course has also hosted the 1987 Ryder Cup and the 1998 Solheim Cup matches. For the first few years, all of his projects were co-designs with either Pete Dye or Desmond Muirhead, who were two of the leading golf course architects of that era.\n\nHis first solo design, Glen Abbey Golf Course in Oakville, Ontario, opened for play in 1976. This course served as the host site for the Canadian Open for many years, the first being in 1977. The oldest golf club in the U.S, Saint Andrew's Golf Club in New York, was redesigned by Nicklaus in 1983. In 2000, the King & Bear opened in St. Augustine, Florida, as a joint collaboration between Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. In 2006, the Concession Golf Club opened in Sarasota, Florida, as a joint collaboration between Nicklaus and Tony Jacklin, to commemorate their historic Ryder Cup singles match in 1969.\n\nNicklaus is in partnership with his four sons and his son-in-law through their company, \"Nicklaus Design\". The company had 299 courses open for play at the end of 2005, which was nearly 1% of all the courses in the world (In 2005 \"Golf Digest\" calculated that there were nearly 32,000 golf courses in the world, approximately half of them in the United States.). While the majority of Nicklaus-designed courses are located in the United States, the company has designed golf courses in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Mexico. For 2009, Nicklaus Design had 12 courses in \"Golf Digest\"'s \"75 Best Golf Resorts in North America\". Past and present Senior Design Associates with Nicklaus Design include Chris Cochran, Chet Williams and Dave Heatwole.\n\nNicklaus has written several golf instructional books, an autobiography (\"My Story\"), a book on his golf course design methods and philosophy, and has produced several golf videos. The writer Ken Bowden often assisted him with this work. His book \"Golf My Way\" is one of the all-time classics of golf instruction, and has been reissued several times since the initial printing in 1974. Nicklaus has also written golf instructional columns for \"Golf Magazine\" and for \"Golf Digest\" magazine, with which he is currently associated. He also appeared as a television analyst and commentator with ABC Sports on golf broadcasts. Several of the books have been reissued, sometimes under different titles, and \"My Story\" as a special high-quality limited edition for the 2000 Memorial Tournament.\n\nBetween 1988 and 1998, Nicklaus also gave his name to promote the successful \"Jack Nicklaus Golf\" computer game series developed by Accolade. Several of the golf courses he designed were incorporated into the fourth incarnation of the game \"Jack Nicklaus 4\" published in 1997. In addition, \"Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge\" by Activision was published in 1999.\n\nNicklaus continues to manage the Memorial Tournament, which he founded in his home state of Ohio. The event is played at Muirfield Village, a course that he co-designed with Desmond Muirhead and opened in 1974. The course was officially dedicated on Memorial Day, May 27, 1974, with an exhibition match between Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf. Nicklaus scored a six-under-par 66, which stood as the course record until 1979. The forerunner to this tournament, the Columbus Pro-Am, had its final year in 1975, and the inaugural Memorial Tournament was held the following year. The tournament is one of the more prestigious events on the PGA Tour.\n\nEach year, the tournament selects one or more individuals as honorees who have made a significant impact to the game. The inaugural tournament in 1976 paid tribute to the late Bobby Jones, while the 25th edition in 2000 honored Nicklaus, himself. This concept was Nicklaus' idea as a contribution to perpetuating achievements of the game's greatest individuals. The honoree is selected by the Captain's Club, a group that acts independently of the tournament organization, but also advises on player invitations and the general conduct of the event. Members of the Captain's Club include Peter Alliss, Peggy Kirk Bell, George H.W. Bush, Sean Connery, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player among others.\n\nThe Memorial Tournament continues the PGA Tour's philanthropic focus through its relationships with Central Ohio charities. The most significant of which is its relationship with Nationwide Children's Hospital since 1976. Contributions generated through the support of over 2,600 volunteers are distributed each year to the Hospital's unrestricted giving fund. This fund assists in ensuring Central Ohio continues to have one of the best children's hospitals in the United States. The Memorial Tournament has raised more than $5.7 million to support the programs and services at Nationwide Children's Hospital in those 30-plus years. In 2005 the Memorial made a pledge that will elevate its level of giving to more than $11 million in the coming years. Unique and successful relationships also exist with Fore Hope, James Cancer Hospital, Wolfe Associates, The First Tee, Central Ohio Junior Golf Association, Shriners, Lions Club and many more.\n\nNicklaus and wife Barbara serve as honorary chairman and active chairwoman of the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation in North Palm Beach, Florida which provides valuable programs and services to more than 4,000 hospitalized children and their families, free of charge, through Child Life programs, the Pediatric Oncology Support Team, and the Safe Kids program. The Nicklauses established \"The Jake\", a pro-am golf tournament played annually at The Bear's Club in Jupiter, Florida in honor of their 17-month-old grandson who drowned in a hot tub in 2005. It has become the foundation's chief fundraiser. Players like Robert Allenby, Raymond Floyd, Tom Watson, Ian Baker-Finch, Ernie Els, Jay Haas, Johnny Miller, and Gary Player have participated. No one accepts a fee. Everything goes to the foundation, more than $3 million over the past three years.\n\nNicklaus and retired General John Shalikashvili, who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993 to 1997, are serving as honorary chairs for the American Lake Veterans Golf Course capital campaign in Tacoma, WA. The $4.5 million campaign in 2009 was established to complete the nation's only golf course designed for the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. The existing nine-hole course is operated, maintained, and managed by 160 volunteers. Funds are needed to add nine new holes and make other improvements to better accommodate demand from the growing influx of wounded veterans. A two-day event was held at Bighorn Golf Club at Palm Desert, CA featuring Nicklaus, who is donating his design services for the \"Nicklaus Nine\". In announcing his donation of services (valued at $500,000), Nicklaus said, \"I was moved to see the amazing efforts at American Lake Veterans Golf Course where our wounded warriors learn to play golf with the help of an incredible army of volunteers.\" Monies raised during the campaign will be used to construct the new holes, complete the construction of the Rehabilitation and Learning Center, make improvements to the original holes to enhance accessibility, upgrade the maintenance facilities and restrooms, and help underwrite operational costs.\n\nNicklaus owns Nicklaus Golf Equipment, which he founded in 1992. Nicklaus Golf Equipment manufactures equipment in three brands: Golden Bear, Jack Nicklaus Signature, and Nicklaus Premium. These brands are designed to target golfers at different stages of golfing ability.\n\nHe has also been known to reach out to younger golfers. One notable example came in 1984, when a teenage Canadian golfer who had previously met Nicklaus at an exhibition wrote him for career advice. The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play. He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him not to change if he was comfortable playing left-handed. The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion. He still keeps Nicklaus' letter framed in his home.\n\nNicklaus lends his name and likeness to a line of flavored lemonades from Arizona Beverage Company, the same company that sells the Arnold Palmer line of lemonade/iced tea blends.\n\nIn 2010, Nicklaus partnered with Terlato Wines to produce a collection of three Napa Valley wines: Jack Nicklaus Private Reserve (a red blend), Cabernet Sauvignon and Private Reserve White (a white blend). In 2012, Golden Bear Reserve, a Bordeaux-style red blend, was released to mark the 50th anniversary of Jack Nicklaus' first major championship victory, the 1962 U.S. Open.\n\nDuring his prime, Nicklaus was consistently among the longest and straightest hitters on the PGA Tour. One early example was winning the official long drive contest at the 1963 PGA Championship with a belt of 341 yards, 17 inches (312 meters). This record lasted more than 20 years. He preferred the fade (left-to-right shape) for his ball flight, since this allowed the ball to stop quickly on hard and fast greens. Another factor in this decision was his distance capabilities, which were developed enough to allow him to play a fade and still reach long par fours and par fives in two shots. Nicklaus considers his longest drive in competition to be during the final round of the 1964 Masters on the 15th hole, where he had less than 160 yards left to the 500 yard par five. He hit an eight-iron slightly over the green for his second shot.\n\nAs his career matured, he also developed the ability to hit the right-to-left controlled draw when needed. Nicklaus debuted as a young pro who hit the ball very high, but he could also hit lower-trajectory shots when needed, after gaining pro experience.\n\nIn 1968, IBM kept PGA Tour statistics for the first time, but did not continue this practice in the immediately subsequent years. Nicklaus led two categories for the 1968 season: he had an average driving distance of 275 yards, and hit 75 percent of greens in regulation; both marks were significantly ahead of rivals.\n\nEven though official PGA Tour statistics did not begin until 1980, Nicklaus was consistently the leader in greens hit in regulation through that year, displaying great command of the long and middle irons. Indeed, Nicklaus remained in the top six of this category through 1985 – far past his best playing years. Nicklaus also finished 10th in driving distance and 13th in driving accuracy in 1980 at age 40, which equated to a \"Total Driving\" composite of 23 – a statistical level not attained since, by a comfortable margin. Nicklaus led this category through 1982. One key to Nicklaus' ball-striking ability and overall power was his exceptional swing tempo. Of this Tom Watson referred to it as Nicklaus' greatest strength in its ability to remain smooth. This proved an asset, especially under pressure, which allowed him to obtain great distance control with his irons.\n\nNicklaus was also known for his course management skills. He would plan to hit each full shot to the optimal position, to best set up his next shot, usually aiming for level lies and clear approach lines, while favoring his preferred shot shapes. He would often hold back on power to achieve this, but had a power advantage over most rivals through the set, so that he could hit a 3-wood or 1-iron from the tee with increased accuracy to avoid trouble, with sufficient length to keep up with the drivers hit by most rivals. An exceptional example of this came in the final round of the 1966 Open Championship at Muirfield, on the 17th hole, a 530-yard par 5 hole. Nicklaus needed a birdie, but the hole was framed by tall fescue rough, and was playing downwind with very firm turf conditions. He used a 3-iron from the tee and hit the shot 290 yards, then hit a 5-iron 240 yards onto the green, two-putted for birdie, and parred the final hole to win the title.\n\nNicklaus was the first player to chart and document yardages on the course on a consistent, planned basis. For most of his career, he was not known for his skill on touch shots with the wedges, so he would often play to avoid wedge shots that needed less-than-full swings. Gary Player stated that Nicklaus had \"the greatest mind the game has ever known\".\n\nNicklaus was not known for being an outstanding putter, but he was often able to make the important putts when they were needed. Nicklaus' putting was highly regarded by his rivals. He was also known as a conservative player at times; he went for broke only when it was necessary. This was especially apparent on the greens, where he would often choose to be less aggressive and make sure of an easy two-putt. Nicklaus spoke about this in his autobiography. \"I was a fine two-putter, but sometimes too defensive—too concerned about three-putting—to go for putts that I probably should have gone for.\"\n\nAfter his first year on the PGA Tour in 1962, Nicklaus received the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year award. As well as receiving the PGA Tour Player of the Year five times and topping the PGA Tour money list eight times, he has also attained the Bob Jones Award and the Payne Stewart Award, among others.\n\nNicklaus was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1974 and the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame in 1995. His likeness was featured on a special commemorative issue five-pound note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland, making him the first living person outside the Royal Family to appear on a British banknote. In 1999 he was on the six man short list for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Century.\n\nIn 2001, Nicklaus was honored with the \"Lombardi Award of Excellence\" from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Coach Lombardi's legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the Coach.\n\nThere is a Jack Nicklaus Museum on the campus of The Ohio State University in his home town of Columbus, Ohio. The museum was opened in 2002 and is a state-of-the-art, facility offering a comprehensive view of Nicklaus' life and career in and out of golf as well as exhibits celebrating the history and legends of the game.\n\nNicklaus had the rare privilege of \"dotting the 'i'\" of \"Script Ohio\", the signature formation of the Ohio State University Marching Band, at the Ohio State homecoming game on October 28, 2006 when the Buckeyes played Minnesota; this is considered the greatest honor that can be bestowed on a non-band member. Nicklaus was the fifth non-band member to receive this award. Other recipients include Bob Hope and Woody Hayes. While at Ohio State University, Nicklaus became a member of the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta.\n\nAlong with Annika Sörenstam, Nicklaus was named a Global Ambassador for the International Golf Federation in 2008 and was instrumental in bringing golf to the Olympics for the 2016 and 2020 games. Golf was last an Olympic sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis, Mo. when the United States and Canada were the only two competing countries. The International Olympic Committee approved the inclusion by a vote of 63–27, with two abstentions.\n\nNicklaus joined Arnold Palmer as an honorary starter for the 2010 Masters. Nicklaus became the eighth honorary starter since the tradition began in 1963 when Nicklaus won his first green jacket. The Big Three were once again reunited in Augusta for the 2012 Masters Tournament as Gary Player joined Palmer and Nicklaus to kickoff the 76th renewal of the major tournament.\nNicklaus, through his global reach in design and development, as well as the worldwide marketing and licensing of his golf and lifestyle brand, is atop \"Golf Inc.\" magazine's coveted list of the \"Most Powerful People in Golf\" for a record-extending sixth consecutive year. He is the only golf industry figure who has ever been named to the No. 1 spot for more than three years. Nicklaus topped the 2009 worldwide list of 35 individuals who were selected by a panel of editors for their ability to influence and impact the business of golf, be it the development of courses and communities, the operation of courses, the equipment used by golfers, or the rules and regulations of the game. \"Golf Inc.\" wrote that while the Golden Bear's reign at No. 1 is unprecedented, \"the fact is that he keeps adding to his legend, at the design table and in the business world. Despite a worldwide course development slowdown, Nicklaus's design firm has over 40 courses in development around the globe...And he remains perhaps golf's most respected spokesperson on a wide range of issues.\"\n\nOn May 19, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass , a bill that would award Nicklaus the Congressional Gold Medal \"in recognition of his service to the nation in promoting excellence and good sportsmanship.\" The bill says that Nicklaus' \"magnetic personality and unfailing sense of kindness and thoughtfulness have endeared him to millions throughout the world.\" Congressman Thomas Massie objected to a voice vote, and demanded a roll call vote. He then tried to rally opposition to the measure, but the vote passed easily over Massie's objection: 371–10.\n\nNicklaus holds the record for PGA major championships with a total 18; Tiger Woods is in second place with 14. Nicklaus has the third most PGA Tour victories with 73, behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (80). Nicklaus also holds the record for the most wins at the Masters with six, and The Players Championship with three. He played on six Ryder Cup teams, captained the team twice and the Presidents Cup team four times, and topped the PGA Tour money list and scoring average eight times each. For 24 straight seasons, from 1960 to 1983 inclusive, he made at least one top ten finish in a major championship, and this is a record.\n\n Defeated Arnold Palmer in 18-hole playoff – Nicklaus (71), Palmer (74).\n\nLA = Low amateur\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\nWD = withdrew\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place.\n\n\nAll of the totals above are stand-alone records with the exception of the longest streak of consecutive cuts made in majors at 39 which was equaled by Tiger Woods (1996–2006) and the longest streak of top-10s in majors which is held by Ben Hogan with 18 between 1948 and 1956.\n\n In an 18-hole playoff, Nicklaus shot a (65) to Rodríguez's (69).\n\nThe Senior British Open was not sanctioned by the circuit then known as the Champions Tour until 2003.\n\nDNP = Did not play\nCUT = Missed the half-way cut\nWD = Withdrew\n\"T\" = tied\nGreen background for wins.

{"id": "491665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=491665", "title": "Javanese people", "text": "Javanese people\n\nThe Javanese (\"Ngoko\" Javanese: , \"Madya\" Javanese: , \"Krama\" Javanese: , \"Ngoko\" Gêdrìk: wòng Jåwå, \"Madya\" Gêdrìk: tiyang Jawi, \"Krama\" Gêdrìk: priyantun Jawi, Malay: suku / orang Jawa) are an ethnic group native to the Indonesian island of Java. With approximately 100 million people (), they form the largest ethnic group in Indonesia. They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of the island. There are also significant numbers of people of Javanese descent in most provinces of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Suriname, Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Javanese ethnic group has many sub-groups, such as the Mataram, Cirebonese, Osing, Tenggerese, Samin, Naganese, Banyumasan, etc.\n\nA majority of the Javanese people identify themselves as Muslims, with a minority identifying as Christians and Hindus. However, Javanese civilization has been influenced by more than a millennium of interactions between the native animism Kejawen and the Indian Hindu—Buddhist culture, and this influence is still visible in Javanese history, culture, traditions, and art forms. With a sizeable global population, the Javanese are considered significant as they are the fourth largest ethnic group among Muslims, in the world, after the Arabs, Bengalis and Punjabis.\n\nLike most Indonesian ethnic groups, including the Sundanese of West Java, the Javanese are of Austronesian origins whose ancestors are thought to have originated in Taiwan, and migrated through the Philippines to reach Java between 1,500BC and 1,000BC. However, according to recent genetic study, Javanese together with Sundanese and Balinese has almost equal ratio of genetic marker shared between Austronesian and Austroasiatic heritages.\n\nHindu and Buddhist influences arrived through trade contacts with the Indian subcontinent. Hindu and Buddhist - traders and visitors, arrived in the 5th century. The Hindu, Buddhist and Javanese faiths blended into a unique local philosophy.\n\nThe cradle of Javanese culture is commonly described as being in Kedu and Kewu Plain in the fertile slopes of Mount Merapi as the heart of the Medang i Bhumi Mataram kingdom. The earliest Sanjaya and Sailendra dynasties had their power base there.\n\nThe centre of Javanese culture and politics was moved towards the eastern part of the island when Mpu Sindok (r. 929-947) moved the capital of the kingdoms eastward to the valleys of the Brantas River in the 10th century CE. The move was most likely caused by the volcanic eruption of Merapi and/or invasion from Srivijaya.\n\nThe major spread of Javanese influence occurred under King Kertanegara of Singhasari in the late 13th century. The expansionist king launched several major expeditions to Madura, Bali in 1284, Borneo and most importantly to Sumatra in 1275. Following the defeat of the Melayu Kingdom, Singhasari controlled trade in the Strait of Malacca.\n\nSinghasari dominance was cut short in 1292 by Kediri's rebellion under Jayakatwang, killing Kertanegara. However, Jayakatwang's reign as king of Java soon ended as he was defeated by Kertanegara's son-in-law, Raden Wijaya with the help of invading Mongol troops in March 1293.\n\nRaden Wijaya would later establish Majapahit near the delta of the Brantas River in modern-day Mojokerto, East Java. Kertanegara policies were later continued by the Majapahits under King Hayam Wuruk and his minister Gajah Mada.\n\nVarious kingdoms of Java were actively involved in the spice trade in the sea route of the Silk Road. Although not major spice producers, these kingdoms were able to stockpile spice by trading for it with rice, of which Java was a major producer. Majapahit is usually regarded as the greatest of these kingdoms. It was both an agrarian and a maritime power, combining wet-rice cultivation and foreign trade. The ruin of their capital can be found in Trowulan.\n\nIslam gained its foothold in port towns on Java's northern coast such as Gresik, Ampel Denta (Surabaya), Tuban, Demak and Kudus. The spread and proselytising of Islam among the Javanese was traditionally credited to Wali Songo.\n\nJava underwent major changes as Islam spread. Following succession disputes and civil wars, Majapahit power collapsed. After this collapse, its various dependencies and vassals broke free. The Sultanate of Demak became the new strongest power, gaining supremacy among city-states on the northern coast of Java.\nAside from its power over Javanese city-states, it also gained overlordship of the ports of Jambi and Palembang in eastern Sumatra. Demak played a major role in opposing the newly arrived colonial power, the Portuguese. Demak twice attacked the Portuguese following their capture of Malacca. They also attacked the allied forces of the Portuguese and the Sunda Kingdom, establishing in the process the Sultanate of Banten.\n\nDemak was succeeded by the Kingdom of Pajang and finally the Sultanate of Mataram. The centre of power moved from coastal Demak, to Pajang in Blora, and later further inland to Mataram lands in Kotagede, near present-day Yogyakarta. The Mataram Sultanate reached its peak of power and influence during the reign of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo between 1613 and 1645.\n\nIn 1619 the Dutch established their trading headquarter in Batavia. Java slowly fell to the Dutch East India Company, which would also eventually control most of Maritime Southeast Asia. The internal intrigue and war of succession, in addition to Dutch interference, caused the Mataram Sultanate to break up into Surakarta and Yogyakarta. The further separation of the Javanese realm was marked by the establishment of the Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman princedom. Although the real political power in those days actually lay with the colonial Dutch, the Javanese kings, in their keratons, still held prestige as the supposed power centre of the Javanese realm, especially in and around Surakarta and Yogyakarta.\n\nDutch rule was briefly interrupted by British rule in the early 19th century. While short, the British administration led by Stamford Raffles was significant, and included the re-discovery of Borobudur. Conflict with foreign rule was exemplified by the Java War between 1825 and 1830, and the leadership of Prince Diponegoro.\n\nLike the rest of the Dutch East Indies, Java was captured by the Empire of Japan during World War II. With Japan's defeat, independence was proclaimed in the new Republic of Indonesia.\n\nWhen the Indonesian independence was proclaimed on 17 August 1945, the last sovereign Javanese monarchies, represented by the Sri Sultan of Yogyakarta, the Sunanate of Surakarta and Prince of Mangkunegara declared that they would become part of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nYogyakarta and Pakualam were later united to form the Yogyakarta Special Region. The Sri sultan became Governor of Yogyakarta, and the Prince of Pakualaman became vice-governor; both were responsible to the President of Indonesia. The Special Region of Yogyakarta was created after the war of independence ended and formalised on 3 August 1950. Surakarta was later absorbed as part of the Central Java province.\n\nThe Javanese culture is one of the oldest civilisations and has flourished in Indonesia. It has gradually absorbed various elements and influences from other cultures, including native reverence for ancestral and natural spirits, Hindu and Buddhist dharmic civilisation, Islamic values, and to a lesser extent, Christianity, Western philosophy and modern ideas. Nevertheless, Javanese culture — especially in the Javanese cultural heartland; those of highly polished aristocratic culture of the \"keratons\" in Yogyakarta and Surakarta — demonstrates some specific traits, such as particular concern with elegance and refinement (Javanese: \"alus\"), subtlety, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one's social stature. Javanese culture values harmony and social order highly, and abhors direct conflicts and disagreements. These Javanese values are often promoted through Javanese cultural expressions, such as Javanese dance, gamelan, wayang and batik. It is also reinforced through adherence to Javanese \"adat\" (traditional rules) in ceremonies, such as \"Slametan, Satu Suro\", Javanese weddings and \"Naloni Mitoni\".\n\nHowever, the culture of \"pesisiran\" of Javanese north coast and in Eastern Java demonstrates some slightly different traits. They tend to be more open to new and foreign ideas, more egalitarian, and less conscious of one's social stature. Some of these northern settlements — such as Demak, Kudus, Tuban, Gresik and Ampel in Surabaya — have become more overtly Islamic, traditionally because these port towns are among the earliest places that Islamic teachings gained foothold in Java.\n\nJavanese culture is traditionally centred in the Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java provinces of Indonesia. Due to various migrations, it can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Suriname (where 15% of the population are of Javanese descent), the broader Indonesian archipelago region, Cape Malay, Malaysia, Singapore, Netherlands and other countries. The migrants bring with them various aspect of Javanese cultures such as Gamelan music, traditional dances and the art of Wayang kulit shadow play. The migration of Javanese people westward has created a coastal Javanese culture in West Java distinct from the inland Sundanese culture.\n\nJavanese is a member of the Austronesian family of languages and is closely related to, but distinct from, other languages of Indonesia. It is notable for its great number of nearly ubiquitous Sanskrit loans, found especially in literary Javanese. This is due to the long history of Hindu and Buddhist influences in Java.\n\nMost Javanese in Indonesia are bilingual, being fluent in Indonesian and Javanese. In a public poll held circa-1990, approximately 12% of Javanese used Indonesian, around 18% used both Javanese and Indonesian, and the rest used Javanese exclusively.\n\nThe Javanese language was formerly written with a script descended from the Brahmi script, natively known as \"Hanacaraka\" or \"Carakan\". Upon Indonesian independence it was replaced with a form of the Latin alphabet.\n\nWhile Javanese was not made an official language of Indonesia, it has the status of regional language for communication in the Javanese-majority regions. The language also can be viewed as an ethnic language because it is one of the defining characteristics of the Javanese ethnic identity.\n\nJavanese intellectuals, writers, poets and men of letters are known for their ability to formulate ideas and creating idioms for high cultural purpose, through stringing words to express a deeper philosophical meanings. Several philosophical idioms sprung from Javanese classical literature, Javanese historical texts and oral traditions, and have spread into several media and promoted as popular mottos. For example, \"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\", used as the national motto of the Republic of Indonesia, \"Gemah Ripah Loh Jinawi, Toto Tentrem Kerto Raharjo\", \"Jer Basuki Mawa Bea\", \"Rawe-Rawe rantas, Malang-Malang putung\" and \"Tut Wuri Handayani\".\n\nThe American anthropologist Clifford Geertz divided in the 1960s the Javanese community into three \"aliran\" or \"streams\": santri, abangan and priyayi. According to him, the Santri followed an orthodox interpretation Islam, the abangan followed a syncretic form of Islam that mixed Hindu and animist elements (often termed \"Kejawen\"), and the priyayi were the nobility.\n\nThe Geertz opinion is often opposed today because he mixed the social groups with belief groups. It was also difficult to apply this social categorisation in classing outsiders, for example other non-indigenous Indonesians such as persons of Arab, Chinese and Indian descent.\n\nSocial stratification is much less rigid in northern coast area.\n\nToday, most Javanese follow Islam as their religion, while only 5-10 percent of Javanese follow orthodox Islamic traditions. Orthodox Muslims are most common in the northern coast bordering the Java Sea, where Islam was first brought to the island. Islam first came in contact with Java during the Majapahit period, when they traded or made tributary relations with various states like Perlak and Samudra Pasai in modern-day Aceh.\n\nA minority of Javanese also follow Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), which are concentrated in Central Java (particularly Surakarta, Magelang and Yogyakarta for Catholicism). Native Christian churches such as the Gereja Kristen Jawa also exist. On a smaller scale, Buddhism and Hinduism are also found in the Javanese community. The Javanese of the Tengger tribe continue to practice Javanese-Hindu today, and live in villages on the slope of Mount Bromo.\n\n\"Kebatinan\", also called \"Kejawen\", \"Agama Jawa\" and \"Kepercayaan\" is a Javanese religious tradition, consisting of an amalgam of animistic, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic, especially Sufi, beliefs and practices. It is rooted in Javanese history and religiosity, syncretising aspects of different religions.\n\nThe Javanese calendar is used by the Javanese people concurrently with two other calendars, the Gregorian calendar and the Islamic calendar. The Gregorian calendar is the official calendar of Indonesia, while the Islamic calendar is used by Muslims and Indonesian government for religious worship and deciding relevant Islamic holidays. The Javanese calendar is presently used mostly for cultural events (such as Siji Surå). The Javanese calendar system is currently a lunar calendar adopted by Sultan Agung in 1633, based on the Islamic calendar. Previously, Javanese people used a solar system based on the Hindu calendar.\n\nUnlike many other calendars, the Javanese calendar uses a 5-day week known as the \"Pasaran\" cycle. This is still in use today and is superimposed with 7-day week of the Gregorian calendar and Islamic calendar to become what is known as the 35-day Wetonan cycle.\n\nThroughout their long history, the Javanese have produced many important buildings, ranging from Hindu monuments, Buddhist stupa, mortuary temples, palace complexes, and mosques.\n\nTwo important religious monuments are the Hindu temple of Prambanan and the Buddhist temple of Borobudur. Both of them are 9th century temples and UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Both are located near Yogyakarta in the slope of Mount Merapi.\n\nMeanwhile, examples of secular buildings can be seen in the ruins of the former capital city of the Majapahit Kingdom (14th to 16th century AD) in Trowulan, East Java. The complex covers an area of 11 km x 9 km. It consists of various brick buildings, a canal ranging from 20 to 40 meters wide, purification pools, temples and iconic split gates. The capital complex is currently being considered as a candidate for becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nTraditional Javanese buildings can be identified by their trapezoid shaped roofs supported by wooden pillars. Another common feature in Javanese buildings are \"pendopo\", pavilions with open-sides and four large pillars. The pillars and other parts of the buildings can be richly carved. This architecture style can be found at \"kraton\", or palaces, of the Sultanates of Yogyakarta (palaces of Hamengkubuwono and Pakualaman) and Surakarta (palaces of Pakubuwono and Mangkunegaran).\n\nTraditional mosques in Java maintain a distinctive Javanese style. The \"pendopo\" model is used as the main feature of mosques as prayer halls. A trapezoidal roof is used instead of the more typically Muslim dome. These roofs are often multi-tiered and tiled. In addition to not using domes, traditional Javanese mosques also often lack minarets. The split gate from earlier Hindu-Buddhist period is still used in many mosques and public buildings in Java.\n\nSome notable examples of mosques using traditional Javanese architecture include the Agung Demak Mosque, the Menara Kudus Mosque and the Grand Mosque of Banten. The Kudus Mosque is also of note because it incorporates Hindu-style stone architecture.\n\nJavanese cuisine and culture place an important role in rice, which is a staple food on the island. Among the Javanese it is considered not to be a meal if a person hasn't eaten rice yet. It is also important part of identity that differentiate Javanese with foreigners that eat bread (the Europeans) and resident of other island who eat sago (for example Moluccans). Rice is also symbol of development and prosperity, while cassava and tuber is associated with poverty.\n\nJavanese cuisine varies by region. Eastern Javanese cuisine has a preference for more salty and hot foods, while the Central Javanese prefer sweeter foods.\n\nA famous food in Javanese cuisine is \"Rujak Cingur\", marinated cow lips and noses served with vegetable, shrimp prawn and peanut sauce with chili. Rojak Cingur is considered a traditional food in Surabaya in East Java.\n\n\"Gudeg\" is a traditional food from Yogyakarta and Central Java which is made from young Nangka (jack fruit) boiled for several hours with palm sugar, and coconut milk.\n\n\"Pecel\", a type of peanut sauce with chili is a common ingredient in Javanese cuisine. It is used in various types of Rujak and Gado-gado. It can also be used as stand-alone sauce with rice, prawns, eggs and vegetables as \"Nasi Pecel\" (Pecel rice).\n\n\"Tumpeng\", is a rice served in the shape of a conical volcano, usually with rice coloured yellow using turmeric. It is an important part of many ceremonies in Java. Tumpeng is served at landmark events such as birthdays, moving house, or other ceremonies. Traditionally, Tumpeng is served alongside fried chicken, boiled egg, vegetables, and goat meat on a round plate made from bamboo called \"besek\".\n\nA notable food in Java is \"tempeh\", a meat substitute made from soy bean fermented with mould. It is a staple source of protein in Java and popular around the world as a meat substitute for vegetarians.\n\nJavanese do not usually have family names or surnames, with only a single name. Javanese names may come from traditional Javanese languages, many of which are derived from Sanskrit. Names with the prefix \"Su-\", which means \"good\", are very popular. After the advent of Islam, many Javanese began to use Arabic names, especially coast populations, where Islamic influences are stronger. Commoners usually only have one-word names, while nobilities use two-or-more-word names, but rarely a surname. Some people use a patronymic. Due to the influence of other cultures, many people started using names from other languages, mainly European languages. Christian Javanese usually use Latin baptism names followed by a traditional Javanese name.\n\nIn Indonesia, Javanese people can be found in all occupations, especially in the government and the military.\n\nTraditionally, most Javanese people are farmers. Farming is especially common because of the fertile volcanic soil in Java. The most important agricultural commodity is rice. In 1997, it was estimated that Java produced 55% of Indonesia's total output of the crop. Most farmers work in small-scale rice fields, with around 42% of farmers working and cultivating less than 0.5 hectares of land. In region where soil is less fertile of where rainy season is short, other staple crops is cultivated, such as cassava.\n\nBlacksmiths are traditionally valued. Some blacksmiths fast and meditate to reach perfection. Javanese blacksmiths create a range of tools and farming equipment, and also cultural items such as gamelan instruments and kris. The Majapahit used fire-arms and cannonade as a feature of warfare. Cetbang, the Javanese bronze breech-loaded swivel-gun, was used ubiquitously by the Majapahit navy, pirates, and rival lords. The demise of the Majapahit empire also caused the flight of disaffected skilled bronze cannon-smiths to Brunei, modern Sumatra and Malaysia, and the Philippines. This led to near universal use of the swivel-gun, especially on trade vessels to protect against pirates, in the Makassar Strait.\n\nKris knives are important items, with many heirloom kris holding significant historical value. The design of the kris is to tear apart an opponent's abdomen, making the injury more severe.\n\nKota Gede is famous for its silverworks and silver handicrafts.\n\nBatiks are traditionally made by women as a pastime, but some town and villages have specialised in making batik, such as Pekalongan, Kauman, Kampung Taman and Laweyan.\n\nThe Javanese art of wood carving is traditionally applied to various cultural attributes such as statues, (wayang-)dolls, and masks. Woodcarving also prominent as house ornamentation and details. The elaborately carved Omah Kudus is a fine example of Javanese woodcarving mastery. The Central Java town of Jepara is famous as a center of Javanese woodcarving workshops, where artists and carpenters especially working on Javan teak wood.\n\nThe Javanese were probably involved in the Austronesian migration to Madagascar in the first centuries C.E. While the culture of the migration is most closely related with the Ma'anyan people of Borneo, a portion of the Malagasy language is derived from loanwords from the Javanese language.\n\nSince the Hindu kingdom period, Javanese merchants settled at many places in the Indonesian archipelago. In the late 15th century, following the collapse of Majapahit and the rise of Muslim principalities on the northern coast of Java, many Hindu nobilities, artisans and courtiers migrated to Bali, where they would contribute to the refined culture of Bali. Others who refused to convert to Islam retreated to Tengger mountain, retaining their Hindu religion and becoming the Tenggerese people.\n\nIn the conflicts during the transitions of power between the Demak, the Pajang and the Mataram in the late 16th century, some Javanese migrated to Palembang in southern Sumatra. There they established a sultanate and formed a mix of Malay and Javanese culture. Palembang language is a dialect of Malay language with heavy influence of Javanese.\n\nDuring the reign of Sultan Agung (1613–1645), some Javanese began to establish settlements in coastal West Java around Cirebon, Indramayu and Karawang. These Javanese settlements were originally commissioned by Sultan Agung as rice farming villages to support the Javanese troop logistics on his military campaign against Dutch Batavia.\n\nThe Javanese were also present in Peninsular Malaya since early times. The Link between Java and Malacca was important during spread of Islam in Indonesia, when religious missionaries were sent from Malacca to seaports on the northern coast of Java. Large migrations to the Malay Peninsula occurred during the colonial period, mostly from Central Java to British Malaya. Migration also took place from 1880 to 1930 from other parts of Java with a secondary migration Javanese from Sumatra. Those migrations were to seek a new life away from the Dutch colonists who ruled Indonesia at that time. Today these people live throughout Peninsular Malaysia and are mainly concentrated in parts of Johor, Perak and Selangor and cities such as Kuala Lumpur. \nToday, the Javanese in Malaysia are included in Malay race along with other native Indonesian ethnics, it is estimated 40% of all Malays in Malaysia at least has some Javanese ancestry.\nIn Singapore, approximately 50-60% of its Malay population have some degree of Javanese ancestry. Most of them have identified themselves as Malays, rather than Javanese.\n\nJavanese merchants were also present in the Maluku Islands as part of the spice trade. Following the Islamisation of Java, they spread Islam in the islands, with Ternate being a Muslim sultanate circa 1484. Javanese merchants also converted coastal cities in Borneo to Islam. The Javanese thus played an important part in transmitting Islam from the western part to the eastern part of the Archipelago with trade based from northern coast of Java.\nNew migration patterns emerged during colonial periods. During the rise of VOC power starting in the 17th century, many Javanese were exiled, enslaved or hired as mercenaries for the Dutch colonies of Ceylon in South Asia and the Cape colony in South Africa. These included princes and nobility who lost their dispute with the Company and were exiled along with their retinues. These, along with exiles from other ethnicities like Bugis and Malay became the Sri Lankan Malay and Cape Malay ethnic groups respectively. Other political prisoners were transported to closer places. Prince Diponegoro and his followers were transported to North Sulawesi, following his defeat in Java War in the early 19th century. Their descendants are well known as Jaton (abbreviation of \"Jawa Tondano\"/Tondano Javanese).\n\nMajor migrations started during the Dutch colonial period under Transmigration programs. The Dutch needed many labourers for their plantations and moved many Javanese under the program as contract workers, mostly to other parts of the colony in Sumatra. They also sent Javanese workers to Suriname in South America. Today approximately 15% of the Suriname population is of Javanese ancestry.\n\nThe Transmigration program that was created by the Dutch continued following independence. A significant Javanese population can be found in the Jabodetabek (Greater Jakarta) area, Lampung, South Sumatra and Jambi provinces. Several \"paguyuban\" (traditional community organisation) were formed by these Javanese immigrants, such as \"Pujakesuma\" (abbreviation of Indonesian: \"Putra Jawa Kelahiran Sumateran\" or Sumatra-born Javanese).\n\n\n"}

He also won titles in Stampede Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Florida, Mid-South, Memphis and the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. He is part of the Hart wrestling family through marriage, teaming with various members throughout his career, and appearing with his daughter Natalya Neidhart on the reality television show \"Total Divas\".\n\nAt Newport Harbor High School, Neidhart first gained athletic acclaim for his success in strength-oriented track and field events. He held the California high school record in shot put from 1973 until 1985. After graduating from high school, Neidhart pursued a career in the National Football League (NFL), where he played for the Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys in practices and preseason games.\n\nFollowing his release from the Dallas Cowboys, Neidhart traveled to Calgary to train with Stu Hart and pursue a career in professional wrestling. He worked for Hart's Stampede Wrestling from 1978 to 1983, and again in 1985, during which time he married Ellie Hart, one of Stu's daughters. He was a two-time Stampede International Tag Team Champion, with Hercules Ayala in 1980 and Mr. Hito in 1983. Stu Hart, seeking publicity for Neidhart, promised him $500 to enter and win an anvil toss at the Calgary Stampede. He did, throwing it 11 feet, 2 inches. This earned him the nickname \"The Anvil\", replacing his prior nickname, \"The Animal\".\n\nStampede had a working relationship with New Japan Pro Wrestling, and Neidhart worked on their Big Fight Series tour in 1982, the New Year Golden Series in 1983 and two shows on March 2 and 3, 1984.\n\nNeidhart teamed twice with King Kong Bundy for Georgia Championship Wrestling in 1983 and worked for Mid-South Wrestling from September till February 1984, where he and Butch Reed held the Mid-South Tag Team Championship for two and a half months. From April to August 1984, Neidhart worked for the Continental Wrestling Association. He then left for Championship Wrestling from Florida, winning their versions of the NWA Southern Heavyweight and NWA United States Tag Team Championship, before leaving for the WWF in January 1985.\n\nWhen Stu Hart sold Stampede Wrestling to Vince McMahon, owner of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Neidhart and Bret Hart were included in the deal. Initially a singles wrestler, managed by Mr. Fuji, Neidhart debuted on January 21, 1985, in Madison Square Garden, defeating Tony Garea. He wrestled Hart, who had a cowboy gimmick, to a draw twice. Bret, upset with his gimmick, suggested to McMahon that he form a tag team with Neidhart.\nThe new team was dubbed The Hart Foundation and was managed by Jimmy Hart (no relation to Bret). They made their pay-per-view debut at WrestleMania 2, where they were the last two eliminated from a 20-man battle royal by André the Giant. The Hart Foundation won their first WWF World Tag Team Championship on the February 7, 1987 episode of \"WWF Superstars\" (taped January 26) from The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and The Dynamite Kid), with the help of referee Danny Davis, who was continually \"distracted\" by checking on Dynamite (laid out of the match early by a megaphone shot from Jimmy), allowing the challengers to double-team Smith. Davis was subsequently fired as referee and began wrestling, aligned with The Hart Foundation. They lost the belts on the November 7 episode of \"Prime Time Wrestling\" (taped October 27), to Strike Force (Rick Martel and Tito Santana).\n\nThe Hart Foundation wrestled in another 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania IV. Bad News Brown attacked and eliminated Hart to win. Neidhart eventually joined Bret's side in the feud with Brown causing a rift between the team and manager Jimmy Hart. This led them to fire him and before starting a feud with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers. In the fall of 1988, Jimmy Hart began managing the Rougeaus. The Hart Foundation unsuccessfully challenged Demolition (Ax and Smash) for the tag title at the 1988 SummerSlam, when Ax hit Hart with Jimmy Hart's megaphone for the pin (Hart accompanied Demolition's manager, Mr. Fuji, solely to further his feud with the challengers). The Hart Foundation continued feuding with Jimmy Hart's wrestlers for the next year, teaming with Jim Duggan to defeat Dino Bravo and The Rougeaus in a 2/3 falls match at the 1989 Royal Rumble, then defeating The Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine at WrestleMania V.\n\nIn April 1989, both Hart Foundation members began wrestling singles matches at house shows. Neidhart also had a few shots at Ravishing Rick Rude's Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in August.\n\nThe Hart Foundation reformed full-time on March 24 in Las Vegas. At WrestleMania VI in Toronto, they defeated The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov) in 19 seconds. They started a second feud with champions Demolition, who at this point added Crush. At SummerSlam 90 on August 27, The Hart Foundation won the title for a second time in a 2/3 falls match.\n\nOn October 30, 1990, The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) defeated The Hart Foundation in a two out of three falls match in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to seemingly win the title. During the match, the top rope broke by accident, and the match did not air on television. The Rockers defended the WWF Tag Team title against Power and Glory (Paul Roma and Hercules) on November 3, 1990. Shortly after November 3, the WWF decided to not air the title change and that the title would revert to the Hart Foundation. In his book, Shawn Michaels claims that the Hart Foundation had politicked to keep the title. The WWF has never officially recognized The Rockers' reign.\n\nThe Hart Foundation reigniting their feud with Jimmy Hart via his team, Rhythm and Blues (Honky Tonk and Valentine). Jimmy Hart once again cost The Hart Foundation the belts at WrestleMania VII, in a match with his new team, The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags), when he distracted the referee, allowing Sags to knock out Neidhart with his motorcycle helmet. Hart and Neidhart again split up, though they reunited for a title rematch with The Nasty Boys on the July 29 \"Prime Time Wrestling\", losing by disqualification when Bret hit both champions with a helmet, again introduced by Jimmy Hart. Neidhart also commentated on \"Wrestling Challenge\" alongside Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby Heenan from March until August 1991.\n\nHe returned to TV action on the November 9 edition of \"Superstars of Wrestling\" against Ric Flair, who continued to apply his figure-four leglock after winning the match, beginning a series of Flair vs Neidhart matches that have continued into a second generation. While hobbling away to the back, he was attacked and further injured by The Beverly Brothers. He was thus replaced in the 1991 Survivor Series by Sgt. Slaughter (who became the team captain).\n\nHe returned on the December 1 edition of \"Wrestling Challenge\", teaming with Owen Hart (Bret's younger brother) as The New Foundation, defeating Barry Horowitz and Duane Gill. Clad in bright parachute pants with checkerboard designs, The New Foundation's highlight was a win over The Orient Express (Kato and Tanaka) at the 1992 Royal Rumble. Aside from one match against The Barbarian and Warlord, they wrestled The Beverly Brothers exclusively at house shows in 1992. He was fired on February 16, 1992 after refusing to take a drug test and throwing a television monitor backstage.\n\nAfter three matches in Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW), Neidhart had three tours with New Japan Pro Wrestling in 1992: The G1 Climax in August (losing in the first round to Kensuke Sasaki), the Super Grade Tag League II in October (teaming with Tom Zenk and finishing with 0 points) and Battle Final in December.\n\nHe debuted for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) on the May 15 episode of \"WCW Worldwide\", beating a jobber. After defeating another jobber on the next episode, Neidhart teamed with The Junkyard Dog for the next, again beating jobbers. Neidhart and The Junkyard Dog beat Paul Orndorff and Dick Slater by disqualification on the June 5 \"WCW Saturday Night\". Eleven days later, he beat Shanghai Pierce in a dark match before Clash of the Champions XXIII. After losing to Maxx Payne at a house show in Kokomo, Indiana, on October 7, Neidhart left WCW.\n\nOn November 13, 1993, Neidhart wrestled The Sandman to a no contest at ECW's November to Remember in the ECW Arena.\n\nNeidhart returned to the WWF at King of the Ring in 1994, as Bret Hart's cornerman for his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match defense against Intercontinental Champion Diesel. After Diesel hit Hart with his Jackknife finisher, Neidhart interfered to prevent the pin, and disqualifying Hart but allowing him to retain the title. After the match, Diesel and Shawn Michaels beat down Hart, and Neidhart didn't intervene. Later that night, Neidhart reappeared at ringside again during Owen Hart's King of the Ring tournament final against Razor Ramon. He attacked Razor outside the ring, behind the referee's back, before Neidhart throwing Razor back for Hart to elbow drop and pin to become \"The King of Harts\", turning heel for the first time since 1988.\n\nOwen had been feuding with Bret since the Royal Rumble. Neidhart, believing Bret had held Owen back from his potential, sided with Owen, and usually cornering him in matches through the summer. Neidhart claimed he'd only helped Bret keep the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at King of the Ring so Owen could take it from him. This opportunity came in a steel cage match at SummerSlam. Neidhart sat in the third row during the match, behind other Hart family members. After Bret won the match, Neidhart entered the cage, locked it and helped Owen beat him down, while the Hart family members tried to climb over it and save him.\n\nNeidhart joined Owen on Shawn Michaels' team, The Teamsters, to face Razor Ramon and The Bad Guys in an elimination match at Survivor Series. After they eliminated every Bad Guy except Razor, after Michaels inadvertently hit Diesel with the Sweet Chin Music. This caused an argument and the tag team partners split up, before Diesel chased Michaels down the aisle. As the other Teamsters tried to intervene, and all were counted out.\n\nBecause Diesel and Michaels were WWF Tag Team Champions when they split, the title was vacated and a tournament held. Neidhart and Hart lost to The New Headshrinkers (Fatu and Sionne) in the first round on the December 31 \"Superstars\", by disqualification. By the time it aired, Neidhart had left the WWF. Bret Hart wrote in his autobiography that the original plan was for Owen and Neidhart to win the tournament and the WWF Tag Team Championships but Neidhart was officially fired due to no-showing events. Owen wound up winning the WWF Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania XI with new partner Yokozuna and years later with fellow brother-in-law The British Bulldog.\n\nOn the July 6, 1996 \"Superstars\", he returned as the masked heel Who, a gimmick designed for commentators Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler to make \"Who's on First?\"-style jokes during his matches (most of which he lost). Who last appeared on TV in the \"Bikini Beach Blast-Off\" party on the SummerSlam pre-show. His last match was a win over Alex Porteau in Miami on September 12.\nNeidhart wrestled for New York independent promotion Ultimate Championship Wrestling (UCW), against Tatanka, his brother-in-law Bruce Hart, King Kong Bundy and Marty Jannetty.\n\nNeidhart returned to the WWF on the April 28, 1997 episode of \"Raw is War\", and attacking Stone Cold Steve Austin and reuniting with Bret and Owen Hart as part of the new Hart Foundation, a stable of Canadian sympathizers, also including Davey Boy Smith and Brian Pillman. On July 6 at in Bret's hometown Calgary, The Hart Foundation defeated the American team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust and The Legion of Doom. Neidhart was part of Team Canada at Survivor Series in Montreal, teaming with The British Bulldog, Doug Furnas and Philip Lafon defeated Team USA Vader, Goldust, \"Marvelous\" Marc Mero and the debut of \"The Lethal Weapon\" Steve Blackman (Bulldog was the sole survivor, Neidhart was pinned by Vader).\n\nAfter Bret and Davey Boy Smith left the WWF on bad terms because of the Montreal Screwjob at \"Survivor Series\". D-Generation X leader and WWF Champion Shawn Michaels offered Neidhart a spot in the group on the November 24 episode of \"Raw Is War\". Neidhart accepted, only for it to be revealed as a setup as the group assaulted Neidhart at the end of the show. The following week on the December 1 episode of \"Raw is War\", DX member Triple H defeated Neidhart. After the match, DX attacked Neidhart once again and spray-painted \"WCW\" on his back, and signifying him following Bret Hart to World Championship Wrestling. Sgt. Slaughter and Ken Shamrock saved him, before Slaughter and Shamrock attacked D-Generation X at the end of the show. After Raw is War, WWF announced that Neidhart was released from his WWF contract on December 2, 1997.\n\nIn January 1998, Neidhart returned to World Championship Wrestling, where he formed a short-lived tag team with The British Bulldog, who also departed from the WWF following the infamous Montreal Screwjob. Although this was his first true big-money deal, they were rarely utilized by WCW. They achieved little in-ring success, and he was eventually released and returned to the independent circuit. His final match for WCW was on the September 26 episode of \"WCW Saturday Night\" where Neidhart and The British Bulldog lost to Stevie Ray and Vincent.\n\nOn \"Raw XV\", the 15th-anniversary \"WWE Raw\" special on December 10, 2007, Neidhart returned to WWE for the first time since 1997, and participated in the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal, eventually making it to the final five before being eliminated by Skinner.\n\nNeidhart made appearances on the WWE and \"E!\" reality show \"Total Divas\", on which his daughter Natalie is a main cast member.\n\nNeidhart appeared in TNA on the November 12, 2009, edition of \"Impact!\" winning against Jay Lethal in his initial open challenge thrown out to the legends of professional wrestling.\n\nNeidhart usually wrestled in pink attire and the Hart Foundation tag team was nicknamed \"The Pink and Black Attack\". It popularized the Hart Attack finisher maneuver.\n\nOn April 6, 2010, WWE released \"\" on DVD, which is a three-disc set featuring a documentary on the Hart wrestling family (including Neidhart) as well as twelve matches. Neidhart's daughter Natalie is featured as a main cast member on the reality show \"Total Divas\", and he made appearances on the show along with his wife.\n\nNeidhart and wife Ellie have three daughters, one of whom, Natalie, is a professional wrestler under the ring name Natalya, currently signed to WWE.\n\nNeidhart was arrested on September 6, 2010, and charged with two counts of possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute, two counts of trafficking illegal drugs, one count of burglary of an unoccupied dwelling, and one count of third degree grand theft for property stolen between $300 and $5,000. He was arrested after becoming aggressive with police after ingesting multiple pills outside a gas station. In March 2012, he was sentenced to five months and 29 days in jail. During his sentencing, he was arrested and held in contempt of court. Neidhart completed two stints in rehabilitation paid for by WWE.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Neidhart's wife Ellie told investigators that on August 13, 2018, he was having problems sleeping and got out of bed to adjust the thermostat. As he went to touch it, he \"turned weirdly as if he were about to dance\", then fell against the wall and ground. She immediately dialed 911, believing he was having a seizure, something for which he took medication. He had a four-inch long gash on his face when EMTs arrived. He died at the scene at the age of 63. According to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, the fall killed him. At the time, he had early-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40255", "title": "Jupiter (mythology)", "text": "Jupiter (mythology)\n\nJupiter (from or \"Iuppiter\" , from Proto-Italic *djous \"day, sky\" + *patēr \"father\", thus \"sky father\"), also known as Jove gen. \"Iovis\" ), is the god of the sky and thunder and king of the gods in Ancient Roman religion and mythology. Jupiter was the chief deity of Roman state religion throughout the Republican and Imperial eras, until Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire. In Roman mythology, he negotiates with Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, to establish principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.\n\nJupiter is usually thought to have originated as an aerial god. His identifying implement is the thunderbolt and his primary sacred animal is the eagle, which held precedence over other birds in the taking of auspices and became one of the most common symbols of the Roman army (see Aquila). The two emblems were often combined to represent the god in the form of an eagle holding in its claws a thunderbolt, frequently seen on Greek and Roman coins. As the sky-god, he was a divine witness to oaths, the sacred trust on which justice and good government depend. Many of his functions were focused on the Capitoline Hill, where the citadel was located. In the Capitoline Triad, he was the central guardian of the state with Juno and Minerva. His sacred tree was the oak.\n\nThe Romans regarded Jupiter as the equivalent of the Greek Zeus, and in Latin literature and Roman art, the myths and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name \"Iuppiter\". In the Greek-influenced tradition, Jupiter was the brother of Neptune and Pluto, the Roman equivalents of Poseidon and Hades respectively. Each presided over one of the three realms of the universe: sky, the waters, and the underworld. The Italic Diespiter was also a sky god who manifested himself in the daylight, usually identified with Jupiter. Tinia is usually regarded as his Etruscan counterpart.\nThe Romans believed that Jupiter granted them supremacy because they had honoured him more than any other people had. Jupiter was \"the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested.\" He personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization, and external relations. His image in the Republican and Imperial Capitol bore regalia associated with Rome's ancient kings and the highest consular and Imperial honours.\nThe consuls swore their oath of office in Jupiter's name, and honoured him on the annual \"feriae\" of the Capitol in September. To thank him for his help (and to secure his continued support), they offered him a white ox \"(bos mas)\" with gilded horns. A similar offering was made by triumphal generals, who surrendered the tokens of their victory at the feet of Jupiter's statue in the Capitol. Some scholars have viewed the \"triumphator\" as embodying (or impersonating) Jupiter in the triumphal procession.\n\nJupiter's association with kingship and sovereignty was reinterpreted as Rome's form of government changed. Originally, Rome was ruled by kings; after the monarchy was abolished and the Republic established, religious prerogatives were transferred to the \"patres\", the patrician ruling class. Nostalgia for the kingship \"(affectatio regni)\" was considered treasonous. Those suspected of harbouring monarchical ambitions were punished, regardless of their service to the state. In the 5th century BC, the \"triumphator\" Camillus was sent into exile after he drove a chariot with a team of four white horses \"(quadriga)\"—an honour reserved for Jupiter himself. When Marcus Manlius, whose defense of the Capitol against the invading Gauls had earned him the name \"Capitolinus\", was accused of regal pretensions, he was executed as a traitor by being cast from the Tarpeian Rock. His house on the Capitoline Hill was razed, and it was decreed that no patrician should ever be allowed to live there. Capitoline Jupiter found himself in a delicate position: he represented a continuity of royal power from the Regal period, and conferred power on the magistrates who paid their respects to him; at the same time he embodied that which was now forbidden, abhorred, and scorned.\n\nDuring the Conflict of the Orders, Rome's plebeians demanded the right to hold political and religious office. During their first \"secessio\" (similar to a general strike), they withdrew from the city and threatened to found their own. When they agreed to come back to Rome they vowed the hill where they had retreated to Jupiter as symbol and guarantor of the unity of the Roman \"res publica\". Plebeians eventually became eligible for all the magistracies and most priesthoods, but the high priest of Jupiter \"(Flamen Dialis)\" remained the preserve of patricians.\n\nJupiter was served by the patrician Flamen Dialis, the highest-ranking member of the \"flamines,\" a college of fifteen priests in the official public cult of Rome, each of whom was devoted to a particular deity. His wife, the Flaminica Dialis, had her own duties, and presided over the sacrifice of a ram to Jupiter on each of the \"nundinae\", the \"market\" days of a calendar cycle, comparable to a week. The couple were required to marry by the exclusive patrician ritual \"confarreatio\", which included a sacrifice of spelt bread to Jupiter Farreus (from \"far\", \"wheat, grain\").\n\nThe office of Flamen Dialis was circumscribed by several unique ritual prohibitions, some of which shed light on the sovereign nature of the god himself. For instance, the \"flamen\" may remove his clothes or \"apex\" (his pointed hat) only when under a roof, in order to avoid showing himself naked to the sky—that is, \"as if under the eyes of Jupiter\" as god of the heavens. Every time the Flaminica saw a lightning bolt or heard a clap of thunder (Jupiter's distinctive instrument), she was prohibited from carrying on with her normal routine until she placated the god.\n\nSome privileges of the \"flamen\" of Jupiter may reflect the regal nature of Jupiter: he had the use of the curule chair, and was the only priest \"(sacerdos)\" who was preceded by a lictor and had a seat in the senate. Other regulations concern his ritual purity and his separation from the military function; he was forbidden to ride a horse or see the army outside the sacred boundary of Rome \"(pomerium).\" Although he served the god who embodied the sanctity of the oath, it was not religiously permissible \"(fas)\" for the Dialis to swear an oath. He could not have contacts with anything dead or connected with death: corpses, funerals, funeral fires, raw meat. This set of restrictions reflects the fulness of life and absolute freedom that are features of Jupiter.\n\nThe \"augures publici\", augurs were a college of \"sacerdotes\" who were in charge of all inaugurations and of the performing of ceremonies known as \"auguria\". Their creation was traditionally ascribed to Romulus. They were considered the only official interpreters of Jupiter's will, thence they were essential to the very existence of the Roman State as Romans saw in Jupiter the only source of state authority.\n\nThe fetials were a college of 20 men devoted to the religious administration of international affairs of state. Their task was to preserve and apply the fetial law \"(ius fetiale)\", a complex set of procedures aimed at ensuring the protection of the gods in Rome's relations with foreign states. Iuppiter Lapis is the god under whose protection they act, and whom the chief fetial \"(pater patratus)\" invokes in the rite concluding a treaty. If a declaration of war ensues, the fetial calls upon Jupiter and Quirinus, the heavenly, earthly and chthonic gods as witnesses of any potential violation of the \"ius\". He can then declare war within 33 days.\n\nThe action of the fetials falls under Jupiter's jurisdiction as the divine defender of good faith. Several emblems of the fetial office pertain to Jupiter. The \"silex\" was the stone used for the fetial sacrifice, housed in the Temple of Iuppiter Feretrius, as was their sceptre. Sacred herbs \"(sagmina)\", sometimes identified as vervain, had to be taken from the nearby citadel \"(arx)\" for their ritual use.\n\nThe role of Jupiter in the conflict of the orders is a reflection of the religiosity of the Romans. On one side, the patricians were able to naturally claim the support of the supreme god as they held the auspices of the State. On the other side, the plebs (plebeians) argued that, as Jupiter was the source of justice, they had his favor because their cause was just.\n\nThe first secession was caused by the excessive debt burden on the plebs. The legal institute of the \"nexum\" permitted a debtor to become a slave of his creditor. The plebs argued the debts had become unsustainable because of the expenses of the wars wanted by the patricians. As the senate did not accede to the proposal of a total debt remission advanced by dictator and augur Manius Valerius Maximus the plebs retired on the Mount Sacer, a hill located three Roman miles to the North-northeast of Rome, past the Nomentan bridge on river Anio. The place is windy and was usually the site of rites of divination performed by haruspices. The senate in the end sent a delegation composed of ten members with full powers of making a deal with the plebs, of which were part Menenius Agrippa and Manius Valerius. It was Valerius, according to the inscription found at Arezzo in 1688 and written on the order of Augustus as well as other literary sources, that brought the plebs down from the Mount, after the secessionists had consecrated it to \"Jupiter Territor\" and built an altar (\"ara\") on its summit. The fear of the wrath of Jupiter was an important element in the solution of the crisis. The consecration of the Mount probably referred to its summit only. The ritual requested the participation of both an augur (presumably Manius Valerius himself) and a pontifex.\n\nThe second secession was caused by the autocratic and arrogant behaviour of the \"decemviri\", who had been charged by the Roman people with writing down the laws in use till then kept secret by the patrician magistrates and the \"sacerdotes\". All magistracies and the tribunes of the plebs had resigned in advance. The task resulted in the XII Tables, which though concerned only private law. The plebs once again retreated to the Sacer Mons: this act besides recalling the first secession was meant to seek the protection of the supreme god. The secession ended with the resignation of the \"decemviri\" and an amnesty for the rebellious soldiers who had deserted from their camp near Mount Algidus while warring against the Volscians, abandoning the commanders. The amnesty was granted by the senate and guaranteed by the \"pontifex maximus\" Quintus Furius (in Livy's version) (or Marcus Papirius) who also supervised the nomination of the new tribunes of the plebs, then gathered on the Aventine Hill. The role played by the \"pontifex maximus\" in a situation of vacation of powers is a significant element underlining the religious basis and character of the \"tribunicia potestas\".\n\nA dominant line of scholarship has held that Rome lacked a body of myths in its earliest period, or that this original mythology has been irrecoverably obscured by the influence of the Greek narrative tradition. After the Hellenization of Roman culture, Latin literature and iconography reinterpreted the myths of Zeus in depictions and narratives of Jupiter. In the legendary history of Rome, Jupiter is often connected to kings and kingship.\n\nJupiter is depicted as the twin of Juno in a statue at Praeneste that showed them nursed by Fortuna Primigenia. An inscription that is also from Praeneste, however, says that Fortuna Primigenia was Jupiter's first-born child. Jacqueline Champeaux sees this contradiction as the result of successive different cultural and religious phases, in which a wave of influence coming from the Hellenic world made Fortuna the daughter of Jupiter. The childhood of Zeus is an important theme in Greek religion, art and literature, but there are only rare (or dubious) depictions of Jupiter as a child.\n\nFaced by a period of bad weather endangering the harvest during one early spring, King Numa resorted to the scheme of asking the advice of the god by evoking his presence. He succeeded through the help of Picus and Faunus, whom he had imprisoned by making them drunk. The two gods (with a charm) evoked Jupiter, who was forced to come down to earth at the Aventine (hence named \"Iuppiter Elicius\", according to Ovid). After Numa skilfully avoided the requests of the god for human sacrifices, Jupiter agreed to his request to know how lightning bolts are averted, asking only for the substitutions Numa had mentioned: an onion bulb, hairs and a fish. Moreover, Jupiter promised that at the sunrise of the following day he would give to Numa and the Roman people pawns of the \"imperium\". The following day, after throwing three lightning bolts across a clear sky, Jupiter sent down from heaven a shield. Since this shield had no angles, Numa named it \"ancile\"; because in it resided the fate of the \"imperium\", he had many copies made of it to disguise the real one. He asked the smith Mamurius Veturius to make the copies, and gave them to the Salii. As his only reward, Mamurius expressed the wish that his name be sung in the last of their \"carmina\". Plutarch gives a slightly different version of the story, writing that the cause of the miraculous drop of the shield was a plague and not linking it with the Roman \"imperium\".\n\nThroughout his reign, King Tullus had a scornful attitude towards religion. His temperament was warlike, and he disregarded religious rites and piety. After conquering the Albans with the duel between the Horatii and Curiatii, Tullus destroyed Alba Longa and deported its inhabitants to Rome. As Livy tells the story, omens \"(prodigia)\" in the form of a rain of stones occurred on the Alban Mount because the deported Albans had disregarded their ancestral rites linked to the sanctuary of Jupiter. In addition to the omens, a voice was heard requesting that the Albans perform the rites. A plague followed and at last the king himself fell ill. As a consequence, the warlike character of Tullus broke down; he resorted to religion and petty, superstitious practices. At last, he found a book by Numa recording a secret rite on how to evoke \"Iuppiter Elicius\". The king attempted to perform it, but since he executed the rite improperly the god threw a lightning bolt which burned down the king's house and killed Tullus.\n\nWhen approaching Rome (where Tarquin was heading to try his luck in politics after unsuccessful attempts in his native Tarquinii), an eagle swooped down, removed his hat, flew screaming in circles, replaced the hat on his head and flew away. Tarquin's wife Tanaquil interpreted this as a sign that he would become king based on the bird, the quadrant of the sky from which it came, the god who had sent it and the fact it touched his hat (an item of clothing placed on a man's most noble part, the head).\n\nThe Elder Tarquin is credited with introducing the Capitoline Triad to Rome, by building the so-called Capitolium Vetus. Macrobius writes this issued from his Samothracian mystery beliefs.\n\nSacrificial victims (\"hostiae\") offered to Jupiter were the ox (castrated bull), the lamb (on the Ides, the \"ovis idulis\") and the wether (on the Ides of January). The animals were required to be white. The question of the lamb's gender is unresolved; while a lamb is generally male, for the vintage-opening festival the flamen Dialis sacrificed a ewe. This rule seems to have had many exceptions, as the sacrifice of a ram on the Nundinae by the \"flaminica Dialis\" demonstrates.\nDuring one of the crises of the Punic Wars, Jupiter was offered every animal born that year.\n\nThe temple to Jupiter Optimus Maximus stood on the Capitoline Hill in Rome. Jupiter was worshiped there as an individual deity, and with Juno and Minerva as part of the Capitoline Triad. The building was supposedly begun by king Tarquinius Priscus, completed by the last king (Tarquinius Superbus) and inaugurated in the early days of the Roman Republic (September 13, 509 BC). It was topped with the statues of four horses drawing a quadriga, with Jupiter as charioteer. A large statue of Jupiter stood within; on festival days, its face was painted red. In (or near) this temple was the \"Iuppiter Lapis\": the Jupiter Stone, on which oaths could be sworn.\n\nJupiter's Capitoline Temple probably served as the architectural model for his provincial temples. \nWhen Hadrian built Aelia Capitolina on the site of Jerusalem, a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was erected in the place of the destroyed Temple in Jerusalem. \n\nThere were two temples in Rome dedicated to \"Iuppiter Stator\"; the first one was built and dedicated in 294 BC by Marcus Atilius Regulus after the third Samnite War. It was located on the \"Via Nova\", below the \"Porta Mugonia\", ancient entrance to the Palatine. Legend has attributed its founding to Romulus. There may have been an earlier shrine \"(fanum)\", since the Jupiter's cult is attested epigraphically. Ovid places the temple's dedication on June 27, but it is unclear whether this was the original date, or the rededication after the restoration by Augustus.\nA second temple of \"Iuppiter Stator\" was built and dedicated by Quintus Caecilus Metellus Macedonicus after his triumph in 146 BC near the Circus Flaminius. It was connected to the restored temple of \"Iuno Regina\" with a portico (\"porticus Metelli\").\n\n\"Iuppiter Victor\" had a temple dedicated by Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges during the third Samnite War in 295 BC. Its location is unknown, but it may be on the Quirinal, on which an inscription reading \"D]iovei Victore\" has been found, or on the Palatine according to the \"Notitia\" in the \"Liber Regionum\" (regio X), which reads: \"aedes Iovis Victoris\". Either might have been dedicated on April 13 or June 13 (days of \"Iuppiter Victor\" and of \"Iuppiter Invictus\", respectively, in Ovid's \"Fasti\").\nInscriptions from the imperial age have revealed the existence of an otherwise-unknown temple of \"Iuppiter Propugnator\" on the Palatine.\n\nThe cult of \"Iuppiter Latiaris\" was the most ancient known cult of the god: it was practised since very remote times near the top of the \"Mons Albanus\" on which the god was venerated as the high protector of the Latin League under the hegemony of Alba Longa.\n\nAfter the destruction of Alba by king Tullus Hostilius the cult was forsaken. The god manifested his discontent through the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the Roman senate to inquire was also greeted by a rain of stones and heard a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the mount requesting the Albans perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (\"nundinae\"). Nonetheless a plague ensued: in the end Tullus Hostilius himself was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightning bolt. The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.\n\nThe \"feriae Latinae\", or \"Latiar\" as they were known originally, were the common festival (\"panegyris\") of the so-called Priscan Latins and of the Albans. Their restoration aimed at grounding Roman hegemony in this ancestral religious tradition of the Latins. The original cult was reinstated unchanged as is testified by some archaic features of the ritual: the exclusion of wine from the sacrifice the offers of milk and cheese and the ritual use of rocking among the games. Rocking is one of the most ancient rites mimicking ascent to Heaven and is very widespread. At the \"Latiar\" the rocking took place on a tree and the winner was of course the one who had swung the highest. This rite was said to have been instituted by the Albans to commemorate the disappearance of king Latinus, in the battle against Mezentius king of Caere: the rite symbolised a search for him both on earth and in heaven. The rocking as well as the customary drinking of milk was also considered to commemorate and ritually reinstate infancy. The Romans in the last form of the rite brought the sacrificial ox from Rome and every participant was bestowed a portion of the meat, rite known as \"carnem petere\". Other games were held in every participant borough. In Rome a race of chariots (\"quadrigae\") was held starting from the Capitol: the winner drank a liquor made with absynth. This competition has been compared to the Vedic rite of the vajapeya: in it seventeen chariots run a phoney race which must be won by the king in order to allow him to drink a cup of \"madhu\", i. e. \"soma\". The feasting lasted for at least four days, possibly six according to Niebuhr, one day for each of the six Latin and Alban \"decuriae\". According to different records 47 or 53 boroughs took part in the festival (the listed names too differ in Pliny NH III 69 and Dionysius of Halicarnassus AR V 61). The \"Latiar\" became an important feature of Roman political life as they were \"feriae conceptivae\", i. e. their date varied each year: the consuls and the highest magistrates were required to attend shortly after the beginning of the administration, originally on the Ides of March: the Feriae usually took place in early April. They could not start campaigning before its end and if any part of the games had been neglected or performed unritually the \"Latiar\" had to be wholly repeated. The inscriptions from the imperial age record the festival back to the time of the decemvirs.\nWissowa remarks the inner linkage of the temple of the Mons Albanus with that of the Capitol apparent in the common association with the rite of the triumph: since 231 BC some triumphing commanders had triumphed there first with the same legal features as in Rome.\n\nThe Ides (the midpoint of the month, with a full moon) was sacred to Jupiter, because on that day heavenly light shone day and night. Some (or all) Ides were \"Feriae Iovis\", sacred to Jupiter. On the Ides, a white lamb (\"ovis idulis\") was led along Rome's Sacred Way to the Capitoline Citadel and sacrificed to him. Jupiter's two \"epula Iovis\" festivals fell on the Ides, as did his temple foundation rites as \"Optimus Maximus\", \"Victor\", \"Invictus\" and (possibly) \"Stator\".\n\nThe \"nundinae\" recurred every ninth day, dividing the calendar into a market cycle analogous to a week. Market days gave rural people \"(pagi)\" the opportunity to sell in town and to be informed of religious and political edicts, which were posted publicly for three days. According to tradition, these festival days were instituted by the king Servius Tullius. The high priestess of Jupiter \"(Flaminica Dialis)\" sanctified the days by sacrificing a ram to Jupiter.\n\nDuring the Republican era, more fixed holidays on the Roman calendar were devoted to Jupiter than to any other deity.\n\nFestivals of viniculture and wine were devoted to Jupiter, since grapes were particularly susceptible to adverse weather. Dumézil describes wine as a \"kingly\" drink with the power to inebriate and exhilarate, analogous to the Vedic Soma.\n\nThree Roman festivals were connected with viniculture and wine.\n\nThe rustic \"Vinalia altera\" on August 19 asked for good weather for ripening the grapes before harvest. When the grapes were ripe, a sheep was sacrificed to Jupiter and the \"flamen Dialis\" cut the first of the grape harvest.\n\nThe Meditrinalia on October 11 marked the end of the grape harvest; the new wine was pressed, tasted and mixed with old wine to control fermentation. In the \"Fasti Amiternini\", this festival is assigned to Jupiter. Later Roman sources invented a goddess \"Meditrina\", probably to explain the name of the festival.\n\nAt the \"Vinalia urbana\" on April 23, new wine was offered to Jupiter. Large quantities of it were poured into a ditch near the temple of Venus Erycina, which was located on the Capitol.\n\nThe \"Regifugium\" (\"King's Flight\") on February 24 has often been discussed in connection with the \"Poplifugia\" on July 5, a day holy to Jupiter. The \"Regifugium\" followed the festival of \"Iuppiter Terminus\" (Jupiter of Boundaries) on February 23. Later Roman antiquarians misinterpreted the \"Regifugium\" as marking the expulsion of the monarchy, but the \"king\" of this festival may have been the priest known as the \"rex sacrorum\" who ritually enacted the waning and renewal of power associated with the New Year (March 1 in the old Roman calendar). A temporary vacancy of power (construed as a yearly \"interregnum\") occurred between the \"Regifugium\" on February 24 and the New Year on March 1 (when the lunar cycle was thought to coincide again with the solar cycle), and the uncertainty and change during the two winter months were over. Some scholars emphasize the traditional political significance of the day.\n\nThe \"Poplifugia\" (\"Routing of Armies\"), a day sacred to Jupiter, may similarly mark the second half of the year; before the Julian calendar reform, the months were named numerically, \"Quintilis\" (the fifth month) to \"December\" (the tenth month). The \"Poplifugia\" was a \"primitive military ritual\" for which the adult male population assembled for purification rites, after which they ritually dispelled foreign invaders from Rome.\n\nThere were two festivals called \"epulum Iovis\" (\"Feast of Jove\"). One was held on September 13, the anniversary of the foundation of Jupiter's Capitoline temple. The other (and probably older) festival was part of the Plebeian Games \"(Ludi Plebei)\", and was held on November 13. In the 3rd century BC, the \"epulum Iovis\" became similar to a lectisternium.\n\nThe most ancient Roman games followed after one day (considered a \"dies ater\", or \"black day\", i. e. a day which was traditionally considered unfortunate even though it was not \"nefas\", see also article Glossary of ancient Roman religion) the two \"Epula Iovis\" of September and November.\n\nThe games of September were named \"Ludi Magni\"; originally they were not held every year, but later became the annual \"Ludi Romani\" and were held in the Circus Maximus after a procession from the Capitol. The games were attributed to Tarquinius Priscus, and linked to the cult of Jupiter on the Capitol. Romans themselves acknowledged analogies with the triumph, which Dumézil thinks can be explained by their common Etruscan origin; the magistrate in charge of the games dressed as the \"triumphator\" and the \"pompa circensis\" resembled a triumphal procession. Wissowa and Mommsen argue that they were a detached part of the triumph on the above grounds (a conclusion which Dumézil rejects).\n\nThe \"Ludi Plebei\" took place in November in the Circus Flaminius.\nMommsen argued that the \"epulum\" of the Ludi Plebei was the model of the Ludi Romani, but Wissowa finds the evidence for this assumption insufficient. The \"Ludi Plebei\" were probably established in 534 BC. Their association with the cult of Jupiter is attested by Cicero.\n\nThe \"feriae\" of December 23 were devoted to a major ceremony in honour of Acca Larentia (or \"Larentina\"), in which some of the highest religious authorities participated (probably including the Flamen Quirinalis and the pontiffs). The Fasti Praenestini marks the day as \"feriae Iovis\", as does Macrobius. It is unclear whether the rite of \"parentatio\" was itself the reason for the festival of Jupiter, or if this was another festival which happened to fall on the same day. Wissowa denies their association, since Jupiter and his \"flamen\" would not be involved with the underworld or the deities of death (or be present at a funeral rite held at a gravesite).\n\nThe Latin name \"Iuppiter\" originated as a vocative compound of the Old Latin vocative *\"Iou\" and \"pater\" (\"father\") and came to replace the Old Latin nominative case *\"Ious\". Jove is a less common English formation based on \"Iov-\", the stem of oblique cases of the Latin name. Linguistic studies identify the form *\"Iou-pater\" as deriving from the Indo-European vocative compound *\"Dyēu-pəter\" (meaning \"O Father Sky-god\"; nominative: *\"Dyēus-pətēr\").\nOlder forms of the deity's name in Rome were \"Dieus-pater\" (\"day/sky-father\"), then \"Diéspiter\". The 19th-century philologist Georg Wissowa asserted these names are conceptually- and linguistically-connected to \"Diovis\" and \"Diovis Pater\"; he compares the analogous formations \"Vedius\"-\"Veiove\" and \"fulgur Dium\", as opposed to \"fulgur Summanum\" (nocturnal lightning bolt) and \"flamen Dialis\" (based on \"Dius\", \"dies\"). The Ancient later viewed them as entities separate from Jupiter. The terms are similar in etymology and semantics (\"dies\", \"daylight\" and \"Dius\", \"daytime sky\"), but differ linguistically. Wissowa considers the epithet \"Dianus\" noteworthy. \"Dieus\" is the etymological equivalent of ancient Greece's \"Zeus\" and of the Teutonics' \"Ziu\" (genitive \"Ziewes\"). The Indo-European deity is the god from which the names and partially the theology of Jupiter, Zeus and the Indo-Aryan Vedic Dyaus Pita derive or have developed.\n\nThe Roman practice of swearing by Jove to witness an oath in law courts is the origin of the expression \"by Jove!\"—archaic, but still in use. The name of the god was also adopted as the name of the planet Jupiter; the adjective \"jovial\" originally described those born under the planet of Jupiter (reputed to be jolly, optimistic, and buoyant in temperament).\n\nJove was the original namesake of Latin forms of the weekday now known in English as Thursday (originally called \"Iovis Dies\" in Latin). These became \"jeudi\" in French, \"jueves\" in Spanish, \"joi\" in Romanian, \"giovedì\" in Italian, \"dijous\" in Catalan, \"Xoves\" in Galician, \"Joibe\" in Friulian, \"Dijóu\" in Provençal.\n\nThe epithets of a Roman god indicate his theological qualities. The study of these epithets must consider their origins (the historical context of an epithet's source).\n\nJupiter's most ancient attested forms of cult belong to the State cult: these include the mount cult (see section above note n. 22). In Rome this cult entailed the existence of particular sanctuaries the most important of which were located on \"Mons Capitolinus\" (earlier \"Tarpeius\"). The mount had two tops that were both destined to the discharge of acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher top was the \"arx\" and on it was located the observation place of the augurs \"(auguraculum)\" and to it headed the monthly procession of the \"sacra Idulia\". On the southern top was to be found the most ancient sanctuary of the god: the shrine of \"Iuppiter Feretrius\" allegedly built by Romulus, restored by Augustus. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (\"silex\"). The most ancient known rites, those of the \"spolia opima\" and of the fetials which connect Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus are dedicated to \"Iuppiter Feretrius\" or \"Iuppiter Lapis\". The concept of the sky god was already overlapped with the ethical and political domain since this early time. According to Wissowa and Dumézil \"Iuppiter Lapis\" seems to be inseparable from \"Iuppiter Feretrius\" in whose tiny templet on the Capitol the stone was lodged.\nAnother most ancient epithet is \"Lucetius\": although the Ancients, followed by some modern scholars such as Wissowa, interpreted it as referring to sunlight, the \"carmen Saliare\" shows that it refers to lightning. A further confirmation of this interpretation is provided by the sacred meaning of lightning which is reflected in the sensitivity of the \"flaminica Dialis\" to the phenomenon. To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet \"Elicius\": while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning, it is in fact related to the opening of the rervoirs of rain, as is testified by the ceremony of the \"Nudipedalia\", meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter. and the ritual of the \"lapis manalis\", the stone which was brought into the city through the \"Porta Capena\" and carried around in times of drought, which was named \"Aquaelicium\". Other early epithets connected with the atmospheric quality of Jupiter are \"Pluvius\", \"Imbricius\", \"Tempestas\", \"Tonitrualis\", \"tempestatium divinarum potens\", \"Serenator\", \"Serenus\" and, referred to lightning, \"Fulgur\", \"Fulgur Fulmen\", later as nomen agentis \"Fulgurator\", \"Fulminator\": the high antiquity of the cult is testified by the neutre form \"Fulgur\" and the use of the term for the \"bidental\", the lightning well dug on the spot hit by a lightning bolt.\n\nA group of epithets has been interpreted by Wissowa (and his followers) as a reflection of the agricultural or warring nature of the god, some of which are also in the list of eleven preserved by Augustine. The agricultural ones include \"Opitulus\", \"Almus\", \"Ruminus\", \"Frugifer\", \"Farreus\", \"Pecunia\", \"Dapalis\", \"Epulo\". Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which should reflect Varro's: \"Opitulus\" because he brings \"opem\" (means, relief) to the needy, \"Almus\" because he nourishes everything, \"Ruminus\" because he nourishes the living beings by breastfeeding them, \"Pecunia\" because everything belongs to him.\nDumézil maintains the cult usage of these epithets is not documented and that the epithet Ruminus, as Wissowa and Latte remarked, may not have the meaning given by Augustine but it should be understood as part of a series including \"Rumina\", \" Ruminalis ficus\", \"Iuppiter Ruminus\", which bears the name of Rome itself with an Etruscan vocalism preserved in inscriptions, series that would be preserved in the sacred language (cf. \"Rumach\" Etruscan for Roman). However many scholars have argued that the name of Rome, \"Ruma\", meant in fact woman's breast. Diva Rumina, as Augustine testifies in the cited passage, was the goddess of suckling babies: she was venerated near the \"ficus ruminalis\" and was offered only libations of milk. Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by Quintus Valerius Soranus, while hypothesising \"Iuno\" (more adept in his view as a breastfeeder), i.e. Rumina instead of Ruminus, might be nothing else than \"Iuppiter\": \"Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum...\".\n\nIn Dumézil's opinion \"Farreus\" should be understood as related to the rite of the \"confarreatio\" the most sacred form of marriage, the name of which is due to the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an agricultural quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor of the effects of the ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.\n\nThe epithet \"Dapalis\" is on the other hand connected to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus. Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however Cato' s prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as \"summus\". The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of the \"epulum Iovis\", from which the god derives the epithet of \"Epulo\" and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.\n\nEpithets related to warring are in Wissowa's view \"Iuppiter Feretrius\", \"Iuppiter Stator\", \"Iuppiter Victor\" and \"Iuppiter Invictus\". \"Feretrius\" would be connected with war by the rite of the first type of \"spolia opima\" which is in fact a dedication to the god of the arms of the defeated king of the enemy that happens whenever he has been killed by the king of Rome or his equivalent authority. Here too Dumézil notes the dedication has to do with regality and not with war, since the rite is in fact the offer of the arms of a king by a king: a proof of such an assumption is provided by the fact that the arms of an enemy king captured by an officer or a common soldier were dedicated to Mars and Quirinus respectively.\n\n\"Iuppiter Stator\" was first attributed by tradition to Romulus, who had prayed the god for his almighty help at a difficult time the battle with the Sabines of king Titus Tatius. Dumézil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in the morale of the fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul Marcus Atilius Regulus vowed a temple to \"Iuppiter Stator\" if \"Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victouriously massacred...It looked as if the gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...\". In a similar manner one can explain the epithet \"Victor\", whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of Sentinum by Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges and who received another vow again in 293 by consul Lucius Papirius Cursor before a battle against the Samnite \"legio linteata\". The religious meaning of the vow is in both cases an appeal to the supreme god by a Roman chief at a time of need for divine help from the supreme god, albeit for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the \"devotio\" of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i.e. was religiously reprehensible.\n\nMore recently Dario Sabbatucci has given a different interpretation of the meaning of \"Stator\" within the frame of his structuralistic and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of Janus, at the beginning of the year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). In this month Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover, January sees also the presence of Veiovis who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of Carmenta who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, \"Prorsa\" and \"Postvorta\" (also named Antevorta and Porrima), of Iuturna, who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter \"Stator\", who plays the role of anti-Janus, i.e. of moderator of the action of Janus.\n\nSome epithets describe a particular aspect of the god, or one of his functions:\n\nSome epithets of Jupiter indicate his association with a particular place. Epithets found in the provinces of the Roman Empire may identify Jupiter with a local deity or site (see syncretism).\n\nIn addition, many of the epithets of Zeus can be found applied to Jupiter, by \"interpretatio romana\". Thus, since the hero Trophonius (from Lebadea in Boeotia) is called Zeus Trophonius, this can be represented in English (as it would be in Latin) as Jupiter Trophonius. Similarly, the Greek cult of Zeus Meilichios appears in Pompeii as Jupiter Meilichius. Except in representing actual cults in Italy, this is largely 19th-century usage; modern works distinguish Jupiter from Zeus.\n\nMarcus Terentius Varro and Verrius Flaccus were the main sources on the theology of Jupiter and archaic Roman religion in general. Varro was acquainted with the \"libri pontificum\" (\"books of the Pontiffs\") and their archaic classifications. On these two sources depend other ancient authorities, such as Ovid, Servius, Aulus Gellius, Macrobius, patristic texts, Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Plutarch.\n\nOne of the most important sources which preserve the theology of Jupiter and other Roman deities is \"The City of God against the Pagans\" by Augustine of Hippo. Augustine's criticism of traditional Roman religion is based on Varro's lost work, \"Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum\". Although a work of Christian apologetics, \"The City of God\" provides glimpses into Varro's theological system and authentic Roman theological lore in general. According to Augustine, Varro drew on the pontiff Mucius Scaevola's tripartite theology:\n\n\nGeorg Wissowa stressed Jupiter's uniqueness as the only case among Indo-European religions in which the original god preserved his name, his identity and his prerogatives. In this view, Jupiter is the god of heaven and retains his identification with the sky among the Latin poets (his name is used as a synonym for \"sky\".) In this respect, he differs from his Greek equivalent Zeus (who is considered a personal god, warden and dispenser of skylight). His name reflects this idea; it is a derivative of the Indo-European word for \"bright, shining sky\". His residence is found atop the hills of Rome and of mountains in general; as a result, his cult is present in Rome and throughout Italy at upper elevations. Jupiter assumed atmospheric qualities; he is the wielder of lightning and the master of weather. However, Wissowa acknowledges that Jupiter is not merely a naturalistic, heavenly, supreme deity; he is in continual communication with man by means of thunder, lightning and the flight of birds (his auspices). Through his vigilant watch he is also the guardian of public oaths and compacts and the guarantor of good faith in the State cult. The Jovian cult was common to the Italic people under the names \"Iove\", \"Diove\" (Latin) and \"Iuve\", \"Diuve\" (Oscan, in Umbrian only \"Iuve\", \"Iupater\" in the Iguvine Tables).\n\nWissowa considered Jupiter also a god of war and agriculture, in addition to his political role as guarantor of good faith (public and private) as \"Iuppiter Lapis\" and \"Dius Fidius\", respectively. His view is grounded in the sphere of action of the god (who intervenes in battle and influences the harvest through weather).\nIn Georges Dumézil's view, Jovian theology (and that of the equivalent gods in other Indo-European religions) is an evolution from a naturalistic, supreme, celestial god identified with heaven to a sovereign god, a wielder of lightning bolts, master and protector of the community (in other words, of a change from a naturalistic approach to the world of the divine to a socio-political approach).\nIn Vedic religion, Dyaus Pitar remained confined to his distant, removed, passive role and the place of sovereign god was occupied by Varuna and Mitra. In Greek and Roman religion, instead, the homonymous gods \"*Diou-\" and \"Διϝ-\" evolved into atmospheric deities; by their mastery of thunder and lightning, they expressed themselves and made their will known to the community. In Rome, Jupiter also sent signs to the leaders of the state in the form of auspices in addition to thunder. The art of augury was considered prestigious by ancient Romans; by sending his signs, Jupiter (the sovereign of heaven) communicates his advice to his terrestrial colleague: the king (\"rex\") or his successor magistrates. The encounter between the heavenly and political, legal aspects of the deity are well represented by the prerogatives, privileges, functions and taboos proper to his \"flamen\" (the \"flamen Dialis\" and his wife, the \"flaminica Dialis\").\n\nDumézil maintains that Jupiter is not himself a god of war and agriculture, although his actions and interest may extend to these spheres of human endeavour. His view is based on the methodological assumption that the chief criterion for studying a god's nature is not to consider his field of action, but the quality, method and features of his action. Consequently, the analysis of the type of action performed by Jupiter in the domains in which he operates indicates that Jupiter is a sovereign god who may act in the field of politics (as well as agriculture and war) in his capacity as such, i.e. in a way and with the features proper to a king. Sovereignty is expressed through the two aspects of absolute, magic power (epitomised and represented by the Vedic god Varuna) and lawful right (by the Vedic god Mitra). However, sovereignty permits action in every field; otherwise, it would lose its essential quality. As a further proof, Dumézil cites the story of Tullus Hostilius (the most belligerent of the Roman kings), who was killed by Jupiter with a lightning bolt (indicating that he did not enjoy the god's favour). \nVarro's definition of Jupiter as the god who has under his jurisdiction the full expression of every being (\"penes Iovem sunt summa\") reflects the sovereign nature of the god, as opposed to the jurisdiction of Janus (god of passages and change) on their beginning (\"penes Ianum sunt prima\").\n\nThe Capitoline Triad was introduced to Rome by the Tarquins. Dumézil thinks it might have been an Etruscan (or local) creation based on Vitruvius' treatise on architecture, in which the three deities are associated as the most important. It is possible that the Etruscans paid particular attention to Menrva (Minerva) as a goddess of destiny, in addition to the royal couple Uni (Juno) and Tinia (Jupiter). In Rome, Minerva later assumed a military aspect under the influence of Athena Pallas (Polias). Dumézil argues that with the advent of the Republic, Jupiter became the only king of Rome, no longer merely the first of the great gods.\n\nThe Archaic Triad is a hypothetical theological structure (or system) consisting of the gods Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus. It was first described by Wissowa, and the concept was developed further by Dumézil. The three-function hypothesis of Indo-European society advanced by Dumézil holds that in prehistory, society was divided into three classes (priests, warriors and craftsmen) which had as their religious counterparts the divine figures of the sovereign god, the warrior god and the civil god. The sovereign function (embodied by Jupiter) entailed omnipotence; thence, a domain extended over every aspect of nature and life. The colour relating to the sovereign function is white.\n\nThe three functions are interrelated with one another, overlapping to some extent; the sovereign function, although essentially religious in nature, is involved in many ways in areas pertaining to the other two. Therefore, Jupiter is the \"magic player\" in the founding of the Roman state and the fields of war, agricultural plenty, human fertility and wealth.\n\nThis hypothesis has not found widespread support among scholars.\n\nApart from being protectress of the arts and craft as Minerva Capta, who was brought from Falerii, Minerva's association to Jupiter and relevance to Roman state religion is mainly linked to the Palladium, a wooden statue of Athena that could move the eyes and wave the spear. It was stored in the \"penus interior\", inner penus of the \"aedes Vestae\", temple of Vesta and considered the most important among the \"pignora imperii\", pawns of dominion, empire. In Roman traditional lore it was brought from Troy by Aeneas. Scholars though think it was last taken to Rome in the third or second century BC.\n\nThe divine couple received from Greece its matrimonial implications, thence bestowing on Juno the role of tutelary goddess of marriage (\"Iuno Pronuba\").\n\nThe couple itself though cannot be reduced to a Greek apport. The association of Juno and Jupiter is of the most ancient Latin theology. Praeneste offers a glimpse into original Latin mythology: the local goddess Fortuna is represented as milking two infants, one male and one female, namely Jove (Jupiter) and Juno. It seems fairly safe to assume that from the earliest times they were identified by their own proper names and since they got them they were never changed through the course of history: they were called Jupiter and Juno. These gods were the most ancient deities of every Latin town. Praeneste preserved divine filiation and infancy as the sovereign god and his paredra Juno have a mother who is the primordial goddess Fortuna Primigenia. Many terracotta statuettes have been discovered which represent a woman with a child: one of them represents exactly the scene described by Cicero of a woman with two children of different sex who touch her breast. Two of the votive inscriptions to Fortuna associate her and Jupiter: \" Fortunae Iovi puero...\" and \"Fortunae Iovis puero...\"\n\nIn 1882 though R. Mowat published an inscription in which Fortuna is called \"daughter of Jupiter\", raising new questions and opening new perspectives in the theology of Latin gods. Dumezil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this \"aporia\" would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the \"Not-Bound\" or \"Enemy of Bondage\", that shows that there is no question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign. who represents the \"Creative Energy\", being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs. Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with Savitr) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions. The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.\n\nThe relation of Jupiter to Janus is problematic. Varro defines Jupiter as the god who has \"potestas\" (power) over the forces by which anything happens in the world. Janus, however, has the privilege of being invoked first in rites, since in his power are the beginnings of things (\"prima\"), the appearance of Jupiter included.\n\nThe Latins considered Saturn the predecessor of Jupiter. Saturn reigned in Latium during a mythical Golden Age reenacted every year at the festival of Saturnalia. Saturn also retained primacy in matters of agriculture and money. Unlike the Greek tradition of Cronus and Zeus, the usurpation of Saturn as king of the gods by Jupiter was not viewed by the Latins as violent or hostile; Saturn continued to be revered in his temple at the foot of the Capitol Hill, which maintained the alternative name \"Saturnius\" into the time of Varro.\nA. Pasqualini has argued that Saturn was related to \"Iuppiter Latiaris\", the old Jupiter of the Latins, as the original figure of this Jupiter was superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held at the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill in Rome which involved a human sacrifice and the aspersion of the statue of the god with the blood of the victim.\n\nThe abstract personification Fides (\"Faith, Trust\") was one of the oldest gods associated with Jupiter. As guarantor of public faith, Fides had her temple on the Capitol (near that of Capitoline Jupiter).\n\n\"Dius Fidius\" is considered a theonym for Jupiter, and sometimes a separate entity also known in Rome as Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. Wissowa argued that while Jupiter is the god of the \"Fides Publica Populi Romani\" as \"Iuppiter Lapis\" (by whom important oaths are sworn), Dius Fidius is a deity established for everyday use and was charged with the protection of good faith in private affairs. Dius Fidius would thus correspond to \"Zeus Pistios\". The association with Jupiter may be a matter of divine relation; some scholars see him as a form of Hercules. Both Jupiter and Dius Fidius were wardens of oaths and wielders of lightning bolts; both required an opening in the roof of their temples.\n\nThe functionality of Sancus occurs consistently within the sphere of \"fides\", oaths and respect for contracts and of the divine-sanction guarantee against their breach. Wissowa suggested that Semo Sancus is the \"genius\" of Jupiter, but the concept of a deity's \"genius\" is a development of the Imperial period.\n\nSome aspects of the oath-ritual for Dius Fidius (such as proceedings under the open sky or in the \"compluvium\" of private residences), and the fact the temple of Sancus had no roof, suggest that the oath sworn by Dius Fidius predated that for \"Iuppiter Lapis\" or \"Iuppiter Feretrius\".\n\nAugustine quotes Varro who explains the \"genius\" as \"the god who is in charge and has the power to generate everything\" and \"the rational spirit of all (therefore, everyone has their own)\". Augustine concludes that Jupiter should be considered the \"genius\" of the universe.\n\nG. Wissowa advanced the hypothesis that Semo Sancus is the genius of Jupiter. W. W. Fowler has cautioned that this interpretation looks to be an anachronism and it would only be acceptable to say that Sancus is a \"Genius Iovius\", as it appears from the Iguvine Tables.\n\nCensorinus cites Granius Flaccus as saying that \"the Genius was the same entity as the Lar\" in his lost work \"De Indigitamentis\". probably referring to the \"Lar Familiaris\". Mutunus Tutunus had his shrine at the foot of the Velian Hill near those of the Di Penates and of Vica Pota, who were among the most ancient gods of the Roman community of according to Wissowa.\n\nDumézil opines that the attribution of a Genius to the gods should be earlier than its first attestation of 58 BC, in an inscription which mentions the \"Iovis Genius\".\n\nA connection between Genius and Jupiter seems apparent in Plautus' comedy \"Amphitryon\", in which Jupiter takes up the looks of Alcmena's husband in order to seduce her: J. Hubeaux sees there a reflection of the story that Scipio Africanus' mother conceived him with a snake that was in fact Jupiter transformed. Scipio himself claimed that only he would rise to the mansion of the gods through the widest gate.\n\nAmong the Etruscan \"Penates\" there is a \"Genius Iovialis\" who comes after \"Fortuna\" and \"Ceres\" and before \"Pales\". Genius Iovialis is one of the \"Penates\" of the humans and not of Jupiter though, as these were located in region I of Martianus Capella' s division of Heaven, while Genius appears in regions V and VI along with Ceres, Favor (possibly a Roman approximation to an Etruscan male manifestation of Fortuna) and Pales. This is in accord with the definition of the Penates of man being Fortuna, Ceres, Pales and Genius Iovialis and the statement in Macrobius that the Larentalia were dedicated to Jupiter as the god whence the souls of men come from and to whom they return after death.\n\nThe god of nighttime lightning has been interpreted as an aspect of Jupiter, either a chthonic manifestation of the god or a separate god of the underworld. A statue of Summanus stood on the roof of the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter, and \"Iuppiter Summanus\" is one of the epithets of Jupiter. Dumézil sees the opposition Dius Fidius versus Summanus as complementary, interpreting it as typical to the inherent ambiguity of the sovereign god exemplified by that of Mitra and Varuna in Vedic religion. The complementarity of the epithets is shown in inscriptions found on \"puteal\"s or \"bidental\"s reciting either \"fulgur Dium conditum\" or \"fulgur Summanum conditum\" in places struck by daytime versus nighttime lightning bolts respectively. This is also consistent with the etymology of \"Summanus\", deriving from \"sub\" and \"mane\" (the time before morning).\n\n\"Iuppiter\" was associated with Liber through his epithet of \"Liber\" (association not yet been fully explained by scholars, due to the scarcity of early documentation).\nIn the past, it was maintained that Liber was only a progressively-detached hypostasis of Jupiter; consequently, the vintage festivals were to be attributed only to \"Iuppiter Liber\". Such a hypothesis was rejected as groundless by Wissowa, although he was a supporter of Liber's Jovian origin. Olivier de Cazanove contends that it is difficult to admit that Liber (who is present in the oldest calendars—those of Numa—in the \"Liberalia\" and in the month of \"Liber\" at Lavinium) was derived from another deity. Such a derivation would find support only in epigraphic documents, primarily from the Osco-Sabellic area. Wissowa sets the position of \"Iuppiter Liber\" within the framework of an agrarian Jupiter. The god also had a temple in this name on the Aventine in Rome, which was restored by Augustus and dedicated on September 1. Here, the god was sometimes named \"Liber\" and sometimes \"Libertas\". Wissowa opines that the relationship existed in the concept of creative abundance through which the supposedly-separate Liber might have been connected to the Greek god Dionysos, although both deities might not have been originally related to viticulture.\n\nOther scholars assert that there was no Liber (other than a god of wine) within historical memory. O. de Cazanove argues that the domain of the sovereign god Jupiter was that of sacred, sacrificial wine (\"vinum inferium\"), while that of Liber and Libera was confined to secular wine (\"vinum spurcum\"); these two types were obtained through differing fermentation processes. The offer of wine to Liber was made possible by naming the \"mustum\" (grape juice) stored in amphoras \"sacrima\".\nSacred wine was obtained by the natural fermentation of juice of grapes free from flaws of any type, religious (e. g. those struck by lightning, brought into contact with corpses or wounded people or coming from an unfertilised grapeyard) or secular (by \"cutting\" it with old wine). Secular (or \"profane\") wine was obtained through several types of manipulation (e.g. by adding honey, or \"mulsum\"; using raisins, or \"passum\"; by boiling, or \"defrutum\"). However, the \"sacrima\" used for the offering to the two gods for the preservation of grapeyards, vessels and wine was obtained only by pouring the juice into amphors after pressing. The \"mustum\" was considered \"spurcum\" (dirty), and thus unusable in sacrifices. The amphor (itself not an item of sacrifice) permitted presentation of its content on a table or could be added to a sacrifice; this happened at the \"auspicatio vindamiae\" for the first grape and for ears of corn of the \"praemetium\" on a dish (\"lanx\") at the\ntemple of Ceres.\n\nDumézil, on the other hand, sees the relationship between Jupiter and Liber as grounded in the social and political relevance of the two gods (who were both considered patrons of freedom). The \"Liberalia\" of March were, since earliest times, the occasion for the ceremony of the donning of the \"toga virilis\" or \"libera\" (which marked the passage into adult citizenship by young people). Augustine relates that these festivals had a particularly obscene character: a \"phallus\" was taken to the fields on a cart, and then back in triumph to town. In Lavinium they lasted a month, during which the population enjoyed bawdy jokes. The most honest \"matronae\" were supposed to publicly crown the \"phallus\" with flowers, to ensure a good harvest and repeal the \"fascinatio\" (evil eye). In Rome representations of the sex organs were placed in the temple of the couple \"Liber Libera\", who presided over the male and female components of generation and the \"liberation\" of the semen. This complex of rites and beliefs shows that the divine couple's jurisdiction extended over fertility in general, not only that of grapes. The etymology of \"Liber\" (archaic form \"Loifer, Loifir\") was explained by Émile Benveniste as formed on the IE theme *leudh- plus the suffix -es-; its original meaning is \"the one of germination, he who ensures the sprouting of crops\".\n\nThe relationship of Jupiter with freedom was a common belief among the Roman people, as demonstrated by the dedication of the \"Mons Sacer\" to the god after the first secession of the \"plebs\". Later inscriptions also show the unabated popular belief in Jupiter as bestower of freedom in the imperial era.\n\nScholars have been often puzzled by Ve(d)iove (or Veiovis, or Vedius) and unwilling to discuss his identity, claiming our knowledge of this god is insufficient. Most, however, agree that Veiove is a sort of special Jupiter or anti-Iove, or even an underworld Jupiter. In other words, Veiove is indeed the Capitoline god himself, who takes up a different, diminished appearance (\"iuvenis\" and \"parvus\", young and gracile), in order to be able to discharge sovereign functions over places, times and spheres that by their own nature are excluded from the direct control of Jupiter as Optimus Maximus. This conclusion is based on information provided by Gellius, who states his name is formed by adding prefix \"ve\" (here denoting \"deprivation\" or \"negation\") to \"Iove \" (whose name Gellius posits as rooted in the verb \"iuvo\" \"I benefit\"). D. Sabbatucci has stressed the feature of bearer of instability and antithesis to cosmic order of the god, who threatens the kingly power of Jupiter as \"Stator\" and \"Centumpeda\" and whose presence occurs side by side to Janus' on January 1, but also his function of helper to the growth of the young Jupiter. In 1858 Ludwig Preller suggested that Veiovis may be the sinister double of Jupiter.\n\nIn fact, the god (under the name \"Vetis\") is placed in the last case (number 16) of the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver—before \"Cilens\" (Nocturnus), who ends (or begins in the Etruscan vision) the disposition of the gods. In Martianus Capella's division of heaven, he is found in region XV with the \"dii publici\"; as such, he numbers among the infernal (or antipodal) gods. The location of his two temples in Rome—near those of Jupiter (one on the Capitoline Hill, in the low between the \"arx\" and the Capitolium, between the two groves where the asylum founded by Romulus stood, the other on the Tiber Island near that of \"Iuppiter Iurarius\", later also known as temple of Aesculapius)—may be significant in this respect, along with the fact that he is considered the father of Apollo, perhaps because he was depicted carrying arrows. He is also considered to be the unbearded Jupiter. The dates of his festivals support the same conclusion: they fall on January 1, March 7 and May 21, the first date being the recurrence of the Agonalia, dedicated to Janus and celebrated by the king with the sacrifice of a ram. The nature of the sacrifice is debated; Gellius states \"capra\", a female goat, although some scholars posit a ram. This sacrifice occurred \"rito humano\", which may mean \"with the rite appropriate for human sacrifice\". Gellius concludes by stating that this god is one of those who receive sacrifices so as to persuade them to refrain from causing harm.\n\nThe arrow is an ambivalent symbol; it was used in the ritual of the devotio (the general who vowed had to stand on an arrow). It is perhaps because of the arrow and of the juvenile looks that Gellius identifies Veiove with Apollo and as a god who must receive worship in order to obtain his abstention from harming men, along with Robigus and Averruncus. The ambivalence in the identity of Veiove is apparent in the fact that while he is present in places and times which may have a negative connotation (such as the \"asylum\" of Romulus in between the two groves on the Capitol, the Tiberine island along with Faunus and Aesculapius, the kalends of January, the nones of March, and May 21, a statue of his nonetheless stands in the \"arx\". Moreover, the initial particle \"ve-\" which the ancient supposed were part of his name is itself ambivalent as it may have both an accrescitive and diminutive value.\n\nMaurice Besnier has remarked that a temple to \"Iuppiter\" was dedicated by \"praetor\" Lucius Furius Purpureo before the battle of Cremona against the Celtic Cenomani of Cisalpine Gaul. An inscription found at Brescia in 1888 shows that \"Iuppiter Iurarius\" was worshipped there and one found on the south tip of Tiber Island in 1854 that there was a cult to the god on the spot too. Besnier speculates that Lucius Furius had evoked the chief god of the enemy and built a temple to him in Rome outside the \"pomerium\". On January 1, the \"Fasti Praenestini\" record the festivals of Aesculapius and Vediove on the Island, while in the \"Fasti\" Ovid speaks of \"Jupiter\" and his grandson. Livy records that in 192 BC, \"duumvir\" Q. Marcus Ralla dedicated to Jupiter on the Capitol the two temples promised by L. Furius Purpureo, one of which was that promised during the war against the Gauls. Besnier would accept a correction to Livy's passage (proposed by Jordan) to read \"aedes Veiovi\" instead of \"aedes duae Iovi\". Such a correction concerns the temples dedicated on the Capitol: it does not address the question of the dedication of the temple on the Island, which is puzzling, since the place is attested epigraphically as dedicated to the cult of \"Iuppiter Iurarius\", in the \"Fasti Praenestini\" of \"Vediove\" and to Jupiter according to Ovid. The two gods may have been seen as equivalent: \"Iuppiter Iurarius\" is an awesome and vengeful god, parallel to the Greek \"Zeus Orkios\", the avenger of perjury.\n\nA. Pasqualini has argued that Veiovis seems related to \"Iuppiter Latiaris\", as the original figure of this Jupiter would have been superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held on the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill, the southernmost hilltop of the Quirinal in Rome, which involved a human sacrifice. The gens Iulia had gentilician cults at Bovillae where a dedicatory inscription to Vediove has been found in 1826 on an ara. According to Pasqualini it was a deity similar to Vediove, wielder of lightningbolts and chthonic, who was connected to the cult of the founders who first inhabited the Alban Mount and built the sanctuary. Such a cult once superseded on the Mount would have been taken up and preserved by the Iulii, private citizens bound to the \"sacra Albana\" by their Alban origin.\n\nVictoria was connected to \"Iuppiter Victor\" in his role as bestower of military victory. Jupiter, as a sovereign god, was considered as having the power to conquer anyone and anything in a supernatural way; his contribution to military victory was different from that of Mars (god of military valour). Victoria appears first on the reverse of coins representing Venus (driving the quadriga of Jupiter, with her head crowned and with a palm in her hand) during the first Punic War. Sometimes, she is represented walking and carrying a trophy.\n\nA temple was dedicated to the goddess afterwards on the Palatine, testifying to her high station in the Roman mind. When Hieron of Syracuse presented a golden statuette of the goddess to Rome, the Senate had it placed in the temple of Capitoline Jupiter among the greatest (and most sacred) deities.\nAlthough Victoria played a significant role in the religious ideology of the late Republic and the Empire, she is undocumented in earlier times. A function similar to hers may have been played by the little-known Vica Pota.\n\nJuventas and Terminus were the gods who, according to legend, refused to leave their sites on the Capitol when the construction of the temple of Jupiter was undertaken. Therefore, they had to be reserved a \"sacellum\" within the new temple. Their stubbornness was considered a good omen; it would guarantee youth, stability and safety to Rome on its site. This legend is generally thought by scholars to indicate their strict connection with Jupiter. An inscription found near Ravenna reads \"Iuppiter Ter.\", indicating that Terminus is an aspect of Jupiter.\n\nTerminus is the god of boundaries (public and private), as he is portrayed in literature. The religious value of the boundary marker is documented by Plutarch, who ascribes to king Numa the construction of temples to Fides and Terminus and the delimitation of Roman territory. Ovid gives a vivid description of the rural rite at a boundary of fields of neighbouring peasants on February 23 (the day of the Terminalia. On that day, Roman pontiffs and magistrates held a ceremony at the sixth mile of the Via Laurentina (ancient border of the Roman \"ager\", which maintained a religious value). \nThis festival, however, marked the end of the year and was linked to time more directly than to space (as attested by Augustine's apologia on the role of Janus with respect to endings). Dario Sabbatucci has emphasised the temporal affiliation of Terminus, a reminder of which is found in the rite of the \"regifugium\". \nG. Dumézil, on the other hand, views the function of this god as associated with the legalistic aspect of the sovereign function of Jupiter. Terminus would be the counterpart of the minor Vedic god Bagha, who oversees the just and fair division of goods among citizens.\n\nAlong with \"Terminus\", \" Iuventas\" (also known as \"Iuventus\" and \"Iuunta\") represents an aspect of Jupiter (as the legend of her refusal to leave the Capitol Hill demonstrates. Her name has the same root as Juno (from \"Iuu-\", \"young, youngster\"); the ceremonial litter bearing the sacred goose of Juno Moneta stopped before her \"sacellum\" on the festival of the goddess. Later, she was identified with the Greek Hebe. The fact that Jupiter is related to the concept of youth is shown by his epithets \"Puer\", \"Iuuentus\" and \"Ioviste\" (interpreted as \"the youngest\" by some scholars). Dumézil noted the presence of the two minor sovereign deities Bagha and Aryaman beside the Vedic sovereign gods Varuna and Mitra (though more closely associated with Mitra); the couple would be reflected in Rome by \"Terminus\" and \"Iuventas\". Aryaman is the god of young soldiers. The function of \"Iuventas\" is to protect the \"iuvenes\" (the \"novi togati\" of the year, who are required to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter on the Capitol) and the Roman soldiers (a function later attributed to Juno). King Servius Tullius, in reforming the Roman social organisation, required that every adolescent offer a coin to the goddess of youth upon entering adulthood.\n\nIn Dumézil's analysis, the function of \"Iuventas\" (the personification of youth), was to control the entrance of young men into society and protect them until they reach the age of \"iuvenes\" or \"iuniores\" (i.e. of serving the state as soldiers).\nA temple to \"Iuventas\" was promised in 207 BC by consul Marcus Livius Salinator and dedicated in 191 BC.\n\nThe Romans considered the Penates as the gods to whom they owed their own existence. As noted by Wissowa \"Penates\" is an adjective, meaning \"those of or from the \"penus\"\" the innermost part, most hidden recess; Dumézil though refuses Wissowa's interpretation of \"penus\" as the storeroom of a household. As a nation the Romans honoured the \"Penates publici\": Dionysius calls them \"Trojan gods\" as they were absorbed into the Trojan legend. They had a temple in Rome at the foot of the Velian Hill, near the Palatine, in which they were represented as a couple of male youth. They were honoured every year by the new consuls before entering office at Lavinium, because the Romans believed the Penates of that town were identical to their own.\n\nThe concept of \"di Penates\" is more defined in Etruria: Arnobius (citing a Caesius) states that the Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; according to Nigidius Figulus, they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men. According to Varro the Penates reside in the recesses of Heaven and are called \"Consentes\" and \"Complices\" by the Etruscans because they rise and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they are always in agreement among themselves. While these last gods seem to be the Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.\n\nThis complex concept is reflected in Martianus Capella's division of heaven, found in Book I of his \"De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae\", which places the \"Di Consentes Penates\" in region I with the \"Favores Opertanei\"; \"Ceres\" and \"Genius\" in region V; \"Pales\" in region VI; \"Favor\" and \"Genius\" (again) in region VII; \"Secundanus Pales\", \"Fortuna\" and \"Favor Pastor\" in region XI. The disposition of these divine entities and their repetition in different locations may be due to the fact that \"Penates\" belonging to different categories (of Jupiter in region I, earthly or of mortal men in region V) are intended. \"Favor(es)\" may be the Etruscan masculine equivalent of \"Fortuna\".\n\n\n\n"}

Cole was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1967.\n\nHe was born on July 10, 1900 in Ithaca, New York to Charles Nelson Cole, an instructor in Latin at Cornell University and Mabel Stewart. Kenneth had a younger brother, , with whom he remained very close throughout his life despite a large difference in age; they were joint authors of four papers published between 1936 and 1942.\n\nIn 1902 the family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, when his father took a post at Oberlin College. His father would later become the Dean. Kenneth's mother was, and Cole graduated from Oberlin College in 1922 and received a Ph.D. in physics with Floyd K. Richtmyer from Cornell University in 1926. He spent summers working at the General Electric laboratory in Schenectady, New York.\n\nIn 1932, Cole married Elizabeth Evans Roberts, an attorney. Later, her work was mostly concerned with civil rights and in 1957 she joined the staff of the United States Commission on Civil Rights\n\nKenneth joined the staff of Columbia University in 1937 and remained there until 1946. He had also been associated with the Presbyterian Hospital, and the Guggenheim Foundation for Advanced Study at Princeton University and the University of Chicago.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1954 he was the technical director of the Naval Medicine Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1954 he became chief of the laboratory of biophysics of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness.\n\nHe achieved advances that led to the \"sodium theory\" of nerve transmission that later won Nobel Prizes for Alan L. Hodgkin and Andrew F. Huxley in 1963. Cole was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1956, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1964. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1967, the award citation, read: \"As a result, we know far more about how the nervous system functions.\" In 1972 he was made a member of the Royal Society of London. The Biophysical Society awards the Kenneth S. Cole medal to a scientist studying cell membranes.\n\nIn 1980 he became an adjunct professor of the Department of Neurosciences at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego.

The parameter formula_7 can assume values between 0 and 1, the former value giving the result of Debye for polar dielectrics. This expression requires that the locus of the dielectric constant in the complex plane be a circular arc with end points on the axis of reals and center below the axis.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the Cole–Cole model is an empirical model of the measured data. It has been successfully applied to a wide variety of tissues over the past 60 years, but it does not give any information about the underlying causes of the phenomena being measured.\n\nSeveral references in the literature use a form of the Cole equation written in terms of impedance instead of a complex permittivity. The impedance formula_8 is given by:\n\nformula_9\n\nWhere formula_10 and formula_11 are the resistances at zero frequency (i.e. DC) and infinity, respectively. formula_12 is often referred to as the characteristic frequency. It should be emphasized that the characteristic frequency is not the same when the analysis is carried out in terms of the complex permittivity.\nA simple interpretation of the above equation is in terms of a circuit where a resistance formula_13 is in series with a capacitor formula_14 and this combination is placed in parallel with a resistance formula_15. In this case formula_16 and formula_17. It can be shown that formula_12 is given by formula_19\n\n\n"}

Also, the largest French territory in North America was sold to the U.S., absorbing their French citizens (see Louisiana Purchase). About thirteen million U.S. residents are of French descent, and about 1.5 million of them speak the French language at home. Being isolated, mixed with different cultures, or ignored, the French-Americans developed particular cultures that reflect varying degrees of adaptation of their environments.

The twins were joined by their lower chest and abdomen and were therefore classified as omphalopagus sharing a liver, pancreas, and a small portion of their small intestine. On November 7, 2011, the twins underwent a successful separation surgery at the Children's Hospital of Richmond in Virginia.\n\nFor every 200,000 live births, conjoined twins are born. Conjoined twins are identical and of the same sex one hundred percent of the time and are more common in females than in males. For surgical separations the survival rate of at least one twin surviving is approximately 75%.\n\nSeparation surgery was critical to this set of twins as 88 percent of the blood flow from the liver was transmitted to Teresa leaving Maria approximately 20 percent smaller due to a lack of nutrients. The Dominican Republic does not have access to the medical tools needed to separate the twins. Upon learning about the twins, World Pediatric Project stepped in and helped.\n\nThe World Pediatric Project is a non-profit organization that heals critically ill children in developing nations that may not have access to quality health care tools or procedures. WPP was founded in 2001 as the International Hospital for Children with a mission \"to link worldwide pediatric surgical, diagnostic and preventative resources to heal critically ill children in developing countries.\" The International Hospital for Children and a non-profit organization based in St. Louis merged in March 2011 and became World Pediatric Project. WPP heard about the twins' story through their partners in the Dominican Republic and as a result brought the twins and their mother to the United States to receive surgery performed by Dr. David Lanning.\n\nThe surgery team included a variety of doctors and surgeons to ensure the twins' safety during and after the procedure. There were a variety of departments from plastics to anesthesiology represented. The surgeon team that completed the 20-hour surgery was composed of the following:\n\n\nDr Lanning also worked alongside the Division of Pediatric Anesthesiology. The Division of Pediatric Anesthesiology played a significant role in the process that leading up to as well as the actual separation surgery.\n\n\nWith a team of 45 surgeons, the separation surgery took approximately 20-hours. The separation process started on November 7, 2011 at 6 am. This was the first time that a surgery of the type was performed at the Children’s Hospital of Richmond. The surgical team divided the pancreas, the liver, as well the organ systems that the twin girls shared. Lastly, the surgical team rebuilt the abdominal walls of the twins.\n\nThe girls underwent a six-week period for physical therapy and recovery. Maria and Teresa are now able to walk independently and are starting to form their own individual personalities. The girls were able to return to the Dominican Republic and often return to the United States for follow-up care.\n\nBackground at VCU \nDr. David Lanning acquired both his M.D. and Ph.D. at Virginia Commonwealth University. In 2002 he finished his general surgical training. His pediatric fellowship was completed at the Children’s Hospital of Michigan. In 2004 he turned to VCU to work.

He later commanded the Second Army during the Battle of Normandy and made rapid advances in the subsequent campaign in Northern France and Belgium and was the first British Army commander to cross the Rhine. A highly professional and dedicated career soldier who made his reputation in active service, Miles Dempsey was highly thought of by both his superiors and subordinates, most notably Montgomery, although he remains relatively unknown.\n\nMiles Christopher Dempsey was born in Wallasey, Cheshire on 15 December 1896. He is the descendant of a powerful clan in Offaly and Laois in Ireland with a very long history. His ancestor Terence O'Dempsey, Viscount Clanmalier, was loyal to the Catholic King James II and, as a result, lost all his lands in 1691. Dempsey's branch of the family then left Ireland for Cheshire.\n\nThe third and youngest son of Arthur Francis and Margaret Maud Dempsey, Miles Dempsey was educated at Shrewsbury School, entering there in 1911, where he captained the first eleven Cricket team in 1914. On leaving Shrewsbury he attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst during the First World War.\n\nDuring the First World War Dempsey, aged just 17, volunteered for the British Army and, after graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in February 1915, six months after the outbreak of war, was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Berkshire Regiment. Promoted to lieutenant in August 1915, he served on the Western Front with the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshires, from June 1916 onwards. The battalion was a Regular Army unit that, as part of the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Division (although by the time of Dempsey's arrival the battalion had been transferred to the 99th Brigade of the same division), had been one of the first units of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to be sent overseas and was stationed in billets away from the trenches in the Béthune sector.\n\nDempsey, serving as a platoon commander in 'D' Company, first saw action during the Battle of Delville Wood in late July 1916, part of the larger Somme offensive. The battalion, although successful in its role, had suffered heavy casualties, including 8 officers, and was relieved in the line and saw little further fighting throughout the year. Dempsey was promoted to acting captain and assumed command of 'D' Company, and later 'B' Company. In November the battalion took part in an assault on Munich Trench, near the River Serre. As at Delville Wood earlier in the year, the assault was successful but with heavy losses, although Dempsey again remained unscathed, and soon returned to England for home leave. In February 1917 he became the adjutant of the battalion.\n\nFollowing attacks near Miraumont and then Oppy, during which Lance Corporal James Welch was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), the battalion, badly understrength, thereafter remained in a quiet sector of the front for most of the year, and was temporarily merged with the 23rd (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers. Dempsey was soon posted as a staff officer at II Corps HQ, before returning to the 1st Royal Berkshires, this time in command of 'A' Company. In late November the battalion attacked Bourlon Wood as part of the Battle of Cambrai. On 12 March 1918, as the Germans prepared to launch their Spring Offensive, they laid down a heavy mustard gas barrage on Dempsey's battalion, which was now at La Vacquerie with Dempsey commanding 'D' Company. Dempsey, along with 10 officers and 250 other ranks, was wounded and later evacuated to England, where he had a lung removed. Returning to the battalion in July, where, with the tide of the war having turned, the 1st Royal Berkshires took part in the Hundred Days Offensive until the war ended on 11 November 1918. By then the battalion was at Escarmain. Dempsey was awarded the Military Cross (MC), which was gazetted in the King's Birthday Honours list in June 1919.\n\nAfter the war, in 1919, Dempsey played two first-class cricket matches for Sussex against Oxford University and Northamptonshire. Between 1926 and 1932, he also played Minor Counties Championship cricket for Berkshire.\n\nDempsey returned to England with the 1st Royal Berkshires after it served in the Allied occupation of the Rhineland, and later, with the battalion, was sent to Iraq in 1919, and later Persia, the following year, where the battalion formed part of North Persia Force (or Norperforce). While his battalion was stationed in Persia, Dempsey took up Pelmanism. In late 1921 the battalion moved again, this time to Bareilly, India, and Dempsey took over 'C' Company, but in 1922 returned to England for his first leave in almost three years, returning to India later in the year before returning to England again in 1923, this time to take up an appointment at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. While there he commanded No. 1 Platoon of No. 1 Company, commanded by Major Richard O'Connor, who had served with distinction during the First World War, and later to serve with Dempsey again, under very different circumstances. Dempsey remained in this post, during which, in 1926, he was able to travel around Europe, until 1927, when he returned to regimental duties, returning to his regiment, although he was posted to the 2nd Battalion, then serving in Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). Dempsey took over 'B' Company, and spent a large amount of his time travelling, mainly by bicycle, around Europe, visiting old battlefields of old wars, as well as likely scenes of battle in any future conflicts.\n\nIn January 1930 Dempsey was admitted to the Staff College, Camberley, graduating in December 1931. His fellow students in the Junior Division included numerous future general officers, including William Gott, George Hopkinson, James Steele, George Symes, Maurice Chilton, Walter Mallaby, Arthur Snelling, Stuart Rawlins, John Nichols and Manley James. In the year senior to Dempsey, in the Senior Division attending from 1929–1930, included Neil Ritchie, Herbert Lumsden, George Erskine, Ivor Hughes, Reginald Denning, Harold Redman and Ian Playfair, while in Dempsey's second year, the Junior Division, attending from 1931–1932, included Brian Horrocks, Sidney Kirkman, Frank Simpson, Joseph Baillon, Arthur Dowler, Thomas Rees, Keith Arbuthnott and Cameron Nicholson. The instructors in Dempsey's first year included Henry Maitland Wilson, George Giffard, Henry Willcox, John Clark and James Gammell, and Arthur Percival and John Smyth. Nearly all of these men were to achieve high rank in the upcoming war.\n\nEnjoying his time at the Staff College, Dempsey's first posting after Camberley was as a General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) to the Military Secretary, where he became responsible for the careers of all officers below the rank of colonel, having access to their annual confidential reports. Dempsey, by now a major (having been promoted in September 1932), held this post until late January 1934, when he handed over to Brian Horrocks upon receiving an appointment as brigade major of the 5th Infantry Brigade. The brigade, commanded by Brigadier Victor Fortune (Francis Nosworthy from 1935), formed part of the 2nd Division, then commanded by Major General Archibald Wavell, was serving in Aldershot Command and took part in numerous large-scale military maneouvres throughout Dempsey's time as brigade major and, after handing over again to Brian Horrocks in February 1936, he returned to the 1st Battalion of his regiment, taking command of HQ Company. The battalion, then stationed in Shorncliffe, Kent, was serving as part of the 10th Brigade of the 4th Division, and shortly after Dempsey's return, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Eric Miles. The following year Dempsey attended a brief course at the Senior Officers' School at Sheerness, before being posted to South Africa, where he served as a GSO2 with the Defence Forces of the Union of South Africa, a posting which he enjoyed. Relinquishing that post in late January 1938, he returned to England soon after to succeed Miles as Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshires, and receiving a promotion to lieutenant colonel. The battalion, still with the 10th Brigade, was both lacking in modern equipment and severely understrength, although, with the possibility of another war in Europe, the situation slowly changed and new equipment and reservists began arriving.\n\nBy the start of the Second World War in September 1939 Dempsey's battalion had moved, transferring from Brigadier Evelyn Barker's 10th Brigade to Brigadier Noel Irwin's 6th Brigade, part of the 2nd Division, commanded by Major General Charles Loyd. Dempsey, with his battalion, was sent to France towards the end of the month, as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). In November he was promoted to the acting rank of brigadier and assumed command of the 13th Infantry Brigade in place of Brigadier Henry Willcox, who had been one of Dempsey's instructors at the Staff College in the 1930s, which was already in France. Aged just 42, he was one of the youngest brigadiers in the British Army. The brigade formed part of Major General Harold Franklyn's 5th Division, although by war's beginning the division was still not fully formed and so the brigade was sent to France as an independent formation two months before, and had spent most of its time on guard duties in the BEF's rear areas. The brigade, together with the 15th Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier Horatio Berney-Ficklin, and the 17th Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier Montagu Stopford, rejoined the 5th Division when the division HQ arrived in late December.\n\nIn May 1940 the brigade saw action on the retreat from the River Dyle and then fought in the major defensive battle on the River Scarpe. When the Belgian Army surrendered in late May the brigade took part in the holding battle on the Ypres-Comines canal allowing Major General Bernard Montgomery's 3rd Infantry Division to cross their rear and secure the gap created by the Belgian collapse. In the subsequent retreat to Dunkirk the brigade provided part of the rear-guard for the BEF during the Dunkirk evacuation. By the time the 13th Brigade returned to England it was reduced to a strength of less than 500 men, out of an original strength of nearly 3,000. For his services in France, Dempsey was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in July 1940, which was presented to him personally by the GOC, Major General Franklyn, who was soon replaced by Major General Berney-Ficklin.\n\nIn July 1940 Dempsey took up the appointment of Brigadier General Staff (BGS) to the Canadian Corps until June 1941 when he was appointed acting rank of major general to command of the 46th Infantry Division and then 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division four months later, which was converting to an armoured division. requiring him to implement a huge training programme. Further challenges were presented in May 1942 when the establishment of British armoured divisions was altered to team an armoured brigade with an infantry brigade rather than two armoured brigades. By the end of the year Dempsey had become well-versed in the direction of combined armoured and infantry formations as well as an experienced trainer of troops.\n\nIn December 1942 Dempsey was promoted to lieutenant general to command XIII Corps of the British Eighth Army in North Africa. Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander, had first spotted Dempsey's potential when he had been one of his students at the Staff College. On arrival in Cairo, Egypt, Dempsey found his corps HQ in reserve because the long lines of communication to Eighth Army's spearhead could only sustain two corps (XXX Corps and X Corps). Dempsey was therefore employed in the planning of the invasion of Sicily and led his corps in the assault on Sicily in July 1943.\n\nThe invasion was spearheaded by airborne forces under Dempsey's command (see operations Ladbroke and Fustian). In early August Dempsey relieved Major General Horatio Berney-Ficklin, commander of the 5th Infantry Division, then under XIII Corps. Towards the end of the campaign, Dempsey's HQ was withdrawn to reserve to plan Operation Baytown, Eighth Army's part in the invasion of Italy across the Strait of Messina. Although his Corps' landing on 3 September was unopposed, the Germans ensured his progress was slow by destroying bridges and culverts on the only routes through the harsh terrain. It took nearly two weeks to advance more than to the north to link up with the U.S. Fifth Army (which contained, in addition to the U.S. VI Corps, the British X Corps) landing at Salerno as part of Operation Avalanche. Allied forces then commenced to fight their way northward with Fifth Army to the west and Eighth Army to the east of Italy's Apennine Mountain spine. The corps later took part in the Moro River Campaign but the severe winter weather forbade any further progress.\n\nIn North Africa, Sicily and Italy, Montgomery's faith in Dempsey had proved justified and he had also gained a reputation for his expertise in Combined Operations. This prompted Montgomery, when he left Italy at the end of 1943 to take command of the 21st Army Group for the forthcoming D-Day landings, to select Dempsey to command the British Second Army. The Second Army was the main British force (although it also included Canadian Army units) involved in the landings, making successful assaults at Gold, Juno and Sword beaches on 6 June 1944.\n\nThe successful assaults were followed by a battle of attrition during which the Anglo-Canadian forces were frustrated by determined German resistance. This fighting drew vital German units including the bulk of their armoured strength to the Caen sector, facilitating the breakout further west in July (see Operation Cobra) by Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army. The Second Army then made a rapid advance across northern France into Belgium, liberating Brussels and Antwerp in September 1944. On 15 October 1944, during a visit to the Second Army, King George VI knighted Dempsey on the battlefield. Because of the fast and successful advance over more than 200 miles in a week Dempsey received the nickname of \"Two Hundred Miles\" Dempsey.\n\nSecond Army's XXX Corps (now commanded by Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks) took part in Operation Market Garden, the failed attempt to secure an early crossing of the River Rhine in September 1944, which Dempsey believed could not succeed and openly questioned to Montgomery. Airborne troops secured a succession of canal and river crossings to enable XXX Corps to reach the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and wheel right into Germany. Intelligence had not detected the presence of unexpected German formations in the area and resistance proved greater than expected frustrating XXX Corps attempts to reach its final objective. During the operation, Dempsey, forward near the front with his Tac HQ, witnessed the crossing of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division's 504th Parachute Regiment cross the Nijmegen bridge. Impressed, he later wrote that the 82nd was \"easily the best division on the Western front\". Dempsey met with the 82nd's commander, Brigadier General James M. Gavin, shook him by the hand and said \"I am proud to meet the commander of the greatest division in the world today.\"\n\nThe Second Army, with XII and XXX Corps in the vanguard and II Canadian Corps under command and VIII Corps in reserve eventually crossed the Rhine on 23 March 1945, and Dempsey was the first British Army commander to do so. On 7 April 1945, \"The Illustrated London News\" carried a full front page of a specially commissioned portrait painting of Dempsey by artist Arthur Pan.\nIn May, Dempsey's men captured Bremen, Hamburg and Kiel. At 11.00 am on 3 May, a delegation of senior German officers led by General Admiral von Friedeberg arrived at Dempsey's Tac HQ and after questioning it appeared that Friedeberg was a representative of \"Generalfeldmarschall\" Keitel and Grand Admiral Dönitz who wished to surrender. In typical fashion Dempsey sent them on their way to report to Montgomery which led to the formal surrender the next day at Lüneberg Heath.\n\nAfter the end of World War II in Europe, Dempsey was appointed to the command of the British Fourteenth Army and GOC in C Malaya Command and then Land Force Commander, South East Asia. By the time he had arrived however, the war in the East was also over. Within his command were 123,000 British and Dutch prisoners and nearly 750,000 captured Japanese.\n\nMiles Dempsey, although modest and unassuming, was considered to be a highly competent officer. He asserted a very effective control over the Second Army (United Kingdom) without taking the limelight. This was despite the stalemate in Normandy and the failure to advance beyond Antwerp and thus ensure that German forces remained isolated. He was claimed by military historian Carlo D'Este to be:\nIn 1946 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of Middle East Land Forces, and was in command throughout the Palestine Emergency. He was made acting general in June 1946 which was made permanent in October 1946 and was appointed to the ceremonial post of Aide de Camp general to the King. Dempsey retired from the British Army in August 1947. In 1950, he was given a 'shadow' appointment as Commander In Chief, British Home forces which he relinquished in 1956. He held the ceremonial posts of Colonel Commandant of the Royal Military Police, (1947 to 1957) as well as the Special Air Service (1951–1960) and Colonel of the Regiment of the Princess Charlotte of Wales Royal Berkshire Regiment (1946 to 1956). He was also Honorary Colonel of the Territorial army's 21st SAS Regiment (Artists Rifles) from 1948 to 1951.\n\nIn 1948, Dempsey married Viola O'Reilly, the youngest daughter of Captain Percy O'Reilly of Coolamber, County Westmeath, Ireland. The couple lived at \"The Old Vicarage\", Greenham, Newbury, Berkshire, and later rented \"Coombe House\", Yattendon, Berkshire. When the former house was requisitioned as part of the U.S. Airforce base, President Eisenhower personally arranged compensation to be paid to his friend and wartime colleague.\n\nHe was Chairman of the Race Course Betting Board, H&G Simonds, Greene King and Sons (the first non-family chairman) and Deputy Chairman of Courage Ltd. He was commissioned as a Deputy Lord Lieutenant in the county of Berkshire in 1950.\n\nDempsey declined to write any memoirs about his military experiences. He ordered that his diaries be burned.\n\nAfter returning to England from visiting a nephew in Kenya, Dempsey was diagnosed with cancer. He died soon afterwards, on 6 June 1969, at the age of 72, exactly 25 years after D-Day. He is buried at Yattendon churchyard, Berkshire.\n\n\n\n"}

Born as Emine Çikotua, she was a member of an Abkhazian princely family Çikotua. Her father waas Prince Ismail Bey Çikotua, and her mother was Princess Aliye Hanım Dziapş-lpa, the daughter of Prince Mahmud Dziapş-lpa. She had a sister named Behiye Hanım. She was the maternal niece of Dürrünev Kadın, first wife of Sultan Abdülaziz. \n\nIn 1874, Emine had been brought to Istanbul as a young child, where her father entrusted her and her sister to the care of her aunt Dürrünev Kadın. her name according to the custom of the Ottoman court was changed to Nazperver.\n\nAbdülaziz was deposed by his ministers on 30 May 1876, his nephew Murad V became the Sultan. He was transferred to Feriye Palace the next day. Her aunt Dürrünev, and other women of Abdülaziz's entourage didn't wanted to leave the Dolmabahçe Palace. So they were grabbed by hand and were send out to the Feriye Palace. In the process, they were searched from head to toe and everything of value was taken from them. Naperver followed her aunt to Feriye Palace. On 4 June 1876, Abdülaziz died under mysterious circumstances.\n\nOne day, when Mehmed was in his forties, he visited aunt-in-law Dürrünev Kadın in the Feriye Palace. Here he saw Nazperver, then eighteen years old, and fell in love with her. He asked his aunt-in-law to give him Nazperver in marriage. She acceded to her nephew-in-law's demand, and the marriage took place in 1888 in the Veliahd Palace. Nazperver didn't bore Mehmed any children. \n\nOn 27 April 1909, after Mehmed's accession to the throne, she was given the title of \"Dördüncü Kadın\". Upon the death of Dürrüaden Kadın in October 1909, Nazperver was given the title of \"Üçüncü Kadın\". \n\nSafiye Ünüvar, a teacher at the Palace School, who met her in 1915, described her as being plump, and tall. According to Ünüvar, Nazperver did not appeared particularly learned, but she did had a refined and kindly air about her that made a good impression. It seems that having no children weighed heavily upon her, despite the fact that the Sultan treated her most kindly and graciously, and so she lived out her life in this rather downhearted fashion.\n\nOn 18 May 1918, Nazperver met with the Empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma in the Dolmabahçe Palace, when the latter visited Istanbul. During the Empress's visit, she communicated with her in French, which she had been taught by her aunt Dürrünev Kadın.\n\nAfter Mehmed's death on 3 July 1918, Nazperver settled in a mansion at Vaniköy, where she died on 9 March 1929. She was buried in Yahya Efendi Cemetery, Istanbul.\n\n\n"}

Later, he returned to China and made important contributions to China's missile and space program.\n\nDuring the Second Red Scare, in the 1950s, the US federal government accused him of communist sympathies. In 1950, despite protests by his colleagues, he was stripped of his security clearance. He decided to return to China, but he was detained at Terminal Island, near Los Angeles.\n\nAfter spending five years under virtual house arrest, he was released in 1955 in exchange for the repatriation of American pilots who had been captured during the Korean War. He left the United States in September 1955 on the American President Lines passenger liner \"SS President Cleveland\", arriving in China via Hong Kong.\n\nUpon his return, he helped lead the Chinese nuclear weapons program. This effort ultimately led to China's first successful atomic bomb test and hydrogen bomb test, making China the fifth nuclear weapons state, and achieving the fastest fission-to-fusion development in history. Additionally, Qian's work led to the development of the Dongfeng ballistic missile and the Chinese space program. For his contributions, he became known as the \"Father of Chinese Rocketry\", nicknamed the \"King of Rocketry\"..He was known as one of the founding fathers of Two Bombs, One Satellite ().\n\nIn 1957, in recognition of his achievements, Qian was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences .\n\nHe was the cousin of mechanical engineer Hsue-Chu Tsien, who was involved in the aerospace industries of China and the United States; his nephew is Roger Y. Tsien, the 2008 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nQian Xuesen was born in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, 180 km southwest of Shanghai. He left Hangzhou at the age of three when his father obtained a post in the Ministry of Education in Beijing. Qian graduated from The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University and attended National Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiaotong University) in 1934. There, he received a degree in mechanical engineering with an emphasis on railroad administration. He interned at Nanchang Air Force Base.\n\nIn August 1935, Qian left China on a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a Master of Science degree after one year.\n\nWhile at MIT he was called Hsue-Shen Tsien. He was influenced by the methods of American engineering education, especially its focus on experimentation. This was in contrast to the contemporary approach practiced by many Chinese scientists, which emphasized theoretical elements rather than \"hands-on\" experience. Tsien's experiments included plotting of pitot pressures using mercury-filled manometers.\n\nTheodore von Kármán, Tsien's doctoral advisor, described their first meeting:\n\nKármán made his home a social scene for the aerodynamicists of Pasadena, and Tsien was drawn in: \"Tsien enjoyed visiting my home, and my sister took to him because of his interesting ideas and straightforward manner.\"\n\nShortly after arriving at Caltech in 1936, Tsien became fascinated with the rocketry ideas of Frank Malina, other students of von Kármán, and their associates, including Jack Parsons. Along with his fellow students, he was involved in rocket-related experiments at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech. Around the university, the dangerous and explosive nature of their work earned them the nickname \"Suicide Squad.\" Tsien received his PhD from Caltech in 1939.\n\nIn 1943, Tsien and two other members of their rocketry group drafted the first document to use the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory, originally a proposal to the Army for developing missiles in response to Germany's V-2 rocket. This led to Private A, which flew in 1944, and later the Corporal, the WAC Corporal, and other designs.\n\nVon Kármán wrote of Tsien, \"At the age of 36, he was an undisputed genius whose work was providing an enormous impetus to advances in high-speed aerodynamics and jet propulsion.\" During this time, he worked on designing an intercontinental space plane, which would later inspire the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a precursor to the American Space Shuttle.\n\nTsien married Jiang Ying (蒋英), a famed opera singer and the daughter of Jiang Baili (蒋百里) and his wife, Japanese nurse Satô Yato. The elder Jiang was a military strategist and adviser to Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek. The Tsiens were married on September 14, 1947 in Shanghai, and had two children; their son Qian Yonggang(钱永刚) was born in Boston on October 13, 1948, while their daughter Qian Yongzhen(钱永真) was born in early 1950 when the family was residing in Pasadena, California.\n\nShortly after his wedding, Tsien returned to America to take up a teaching position at MIT. Jiang Ying would join him in December 1947. In 1949, with the recommendation of von Kármán, Tsien became Robert H. Goddard Professor of Jet Propulsion at Caltech.\n\nIn 1947 Tsien was granted a permanent resident permit, and in 1949 he applied for naturalization, although he could not obtain citizenship. Years later, his wife Jiang Ying said in an interview with Phoenix Television that Tsien could not raise the necessary funds.\n\nBy the early 1940s, US Army Intelligence was already aware of allegations that Tsien was a Communist, but his security clearance was not suspended. However, on June 6, 1950 his security clearance was revoked and Tsien was questioned by the FBI. Two weeks later Tsien announced that he would be resigning from Caltech and returning to China, which by then was effectively governed by the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong.\n\nIn August, Tsien had a conversation on the subject with the then Under Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball, whom Tsien knew on a personal basis. After Tsien told him of the allegations, Kimball responded, \"Hell, I don't think you're a Communist\", at which point Tsien indicated that he still intended to leave the country, saying \"I'm Chinese. I don't want to build weapons to kill my countrymen. It's that simple.\" Kimball then said, \"I won't let you out of the country.\"\n\nAfter the firm in charge of arranging Tsien's move back to China tipped off U.S. Customs that some of the papers encountered among his possessions were marked \"Secret\" or \"Confidential,\" U.S. officials seized them from a Pasadena warehouse. The U.S. Immigration and Nationalization Service issued a warrant for Tsien's arrest on August 25. Tsien claimed that the security-stamped documents were mostly written by himself and had outdated classifications, adding that, \"There were some drawings and logarithm tables, etc., which someone might have mistaken for codes.\" Included in the material was a scrapbook with news clippings about the trials of those charged with atomic espionage, such as Klaus Fuchs. Subsequent examination of the documents showed they contained no classified material.\n\nWhile at Caltech, Tsien had secretly attended meetings with J. Robert Oppenheimer's brother Frank Oppenheimer, Jack Parsons, and Frank Malina that were organized by the Russian-born Jewish chemist Sidney Weinbaum and called Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Weinbaum's trial commenced on August 30 and both Frank Oppenheimer and Parsons testified against him. Weinbaum was convicted of perjury and sentenced to four years. Tsien was taken into custody on September 6, 1950 for questioning and for two weeks detained at Terminal Island, a low-security United States federal prison near the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\n\nWhen Tsien had returned from China with his new bride in 1947, he had answered \"no\" on an immigration questionnaire that asked if he ever had been a member of an organization advocating overthrow of the U.S. Government by force. This, together with an American Communist Party document from 1938 with Tsien's name on it, was used to argue that Tsien was a national security threat. Prosecutors also cited a cross-examination session where Tsien said, \"I owe allegiance to the people of China\" and would \"certainly not\" let the United States government make his decision for him as to whom he would owe allegiance to in the event of a conflict between the U.S. and communist China.\n\nOn April 26, 1951 Tsien was declared subject to deportation and forbidden from leaving Los Angeles County without permission, effectively placing him under house arrest.\n\nDuring this time Tsien wrote \"Engineering Cybernetics\" which was published by McGraw Hill in 1954. The book deals with the practice of stabilizing servomechanisms. In its 18 chapters it considers non-interacting controls of many-variable systems, control design by perturbation theory, and von Neumann's theory of error control (chapter 18). Ezra Krendel reviewed the book, stating that it is \"difficult to overstate the value of Tsien's book to those interested in the overall theory of complex control systems.\" Evidently Tsien's approach is primarily practical, as Krendel notes that for servomechanisms the \"usual linear design criterion of stability is inadequate and other criteria arising from the physics of the problem must be used.\"\n\nQian became the subject of five years of secret diplomacy and negotiation between the U.S. and China. During this time he lived under constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any classified research duties. Qian received support from his colleagues at Caltech during his incarceration, including president Lee DuBridge, who flew to Washington to argue Qian's case. Caltech appointed attorney Grant Cooper to defend Qian.\n\nThe travel ban on Qian was lifted on and he resigned from Caltech shortly thereafter. Qian departed from Los Angeles aboard the \"SS President Cleveland\" in September 1955 amidst rumors that his release was a swap for 11 U.S. airmen held captive by China since the end of the Korean War.\n\nUnder Secretary Kimball, who had tried for several years to keep Qian in the U.S., commented on his treatment: \"It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go.\"\n\nImmediately upon his return, Qian began a remarkably successful career in rocket science, boosted by the reputation he garnered for his past achievements as well as Chinese state support for his nuclear research. He led and eventually became the father of the Chinese missile program, which constructed the Dongfeng ballistic missiles and the Long March space rockets.\n\nIn October 1956, he became the director of the Fifth Academy of the Ministry of National Defense, tasked with ballistic missile and nuclear weapons development. He was part of the overall effort that resulted in the successful \"596\" atomic bomb test on October 16, 1964, and the \"Test No. 6\" hydrogen bomb test on June 17, 1967. This was the fastest fission-to-fusion development in history at 32 months, compared to 86 months for the United States and 75 months for the USSR, and gave China a thermonuclear device ahead of major Western powers like France.\n\nQian's reputation as a prominent scientist who essentially defected from the United States to China gave him considerable influence in the era of Mao Zedong and afterward. Qian eventually rose through Party ranks to become a Central Committee member. He became associated with the \"China's Space Program - From Conception to Manned Spaceflight\" initiative.\n\nQian was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1957, a lifelong honor granted to Chinese scientists who have made significant advancements in their field. He organized scientific seminars and dedicated some of his time to training successors for his positions.\n\nHe was heavily involved in the eastablishment of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 1958 and served as the Chairman of the Department of Modern Mechanics of the university for a number of years.\n\nOutside of rocketry, Qian had a presence in numerous areas of study. He was among the creators of systematics, and made contributions to science and technology systems, somatic science, engineering science, military science, social science, the natural sciences, geography, philosophy, literature and art, and education. His advancements in the concepts, theories, and methods of the system science field include studying the open complex giant system. Additionally, he helped establish the Chinese school of complexity science.\n\nFrom the 1980s onward, Qian had advocated the scientific investigation of traditional Chinese medicine, Qigong, and the concept of \"special human body functions\". He particularly encouraged scientists to accumulate observational data on qigong so that future scientific theories could be established.\n\nQian retired in 1991 and lived quietly in Beijing, refusing to speak to Westerners.\n\nIn 1979 Qian was awarded Caltech's \"Distinguished Alumni Award\" for his achievements. Qian eventually received his award from Caltech, and with the help of his friend Frank Marble brought it to his home in a widely covered ceremony. Furthermore, in the early 1990s, the filing cabinets containing Qian's research work were offered to him by Caltech.\n\nQian was invited to visit the US by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics after the normalization of the Sino-US relationship, but he refused the invitation, having wanted a formal apology for his detention. In a reminiscence published in 2002, Marble stated that he believed Qian had \"lost faith in the American government\" but that he had \"always had very warm feelings for the American people.\"\n\nThe Chinese government launched its manned space program in 1992, reportedly with some help from Russia due to their extended history in space. Qian's research was used as the basis for the Long March rocket, which successfully launched the Shenzhou V mission in October 2003. The elderly Qian was able to watch China's first manned space mission on television from his hospital bed.\nIn 2008, he was named Aviation Week and Space Technology Person of the Year. The recognition was not intended as an honor, but is given to the person judged to have the greatest impact on aviation in the past year. Furthermore, that year China Central Television named Qian as one of the eleven most inspiring people in China.\n\nIn July 2009, the Omega Alpha Association, an international systems engineering honor society, named Qian (H. S. Tsien) one of four Honorary Members.\n\nOn October 31, 2009, Qian died at the age of 97 in Beijing.\n\nA Chinese film production, Qian Xue Sen, directed by Zhang Jianya and starring Chen Kun as Qian was released on December 11, 2011 in both Asia and North America, and on March 2, 2012 in China.\n\nScience fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, in his novel \",\" named a Chinese spaceship after him. The science fiction novel series \"The Expanse\" by James S. A. Corey also named a Martian spaceship after him (MCRN Xuesen). In the 1981 novel Noble House by James Clavell, the American-Chinese scientist who defected to China and helped develop the first atom bomb for China, Dr. Joseph Yu, is a fictionalized version of Dr. Qian Xuesen.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The next call came from the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). Lowery was appointed as a fireman in 1941. He was promoted to fire marshal in 1946, and that same year won a commendation for arresting a man for 30 acts of arson and burglary. In 1960, he was cited for capturing an armed arsonist, and the next year became an acting lieutenant in the Bureau of Fire Investigation. During this time Lowery was an active member of the Vulcan Society, serving as its President from 1946 to 1950, 1953 and 1954, 1957, and from 1959 to 1963.\n\nOn November 14, 1963, Lowery was appointed Deputy Fire Commissioner. He addressed the racial issue straightforwardly, striving to increase the proportion of blacks and the sensitivity of whites. He also raised the number of black firefighters assigned to black neighborhoods, as well as the number of blacks in leadership roles.\n\nOn November 23, 1965, incoming Mayor Lindsay announced the appointment of Lowery as Fire Commissioner of the New York City Fire Department. His was the first commissioner level appointment announced by the Mayor-elect. Lowery, who was the first African American to serve as a Fire Commissioner of a major U.S. city, served in that position for more than 7 years until his resignation on September 29, 1973 in order to campaign for then-Controller Abraham D. Beame, the Democratic candidate for Mayor. \n\nLowery died on July 24, 2001 in Manhattan at the age of 85.\n\nEither as tribute or by happenstance, his name is shown prominently in a scene of the first movie \"The Godfather\", printed in bold red letters on a hospital fire safety box in the scene where Michael Corleone protects his father, Vito Corleone, against would-be assassins in the absence of his bodyguards. The action is set to be prior to 1946, however, so the reference is anachronistic.\n"}

She was the younger daughter of the radical editor Benjamin Flower, and his wife Eliza Gould.\n\nHer father's mother Martha, sister of the wealthy bankers William Fuller and Richard Fuller, had died the month before Adam's birth. Her elder sister was the composer Eliza Flower. Her uncles included Richard Flower, who emigrated to the United States in 1822 and was a founder of the town of Albion, Illinois; and the nonconformist minister John Clayton.\n\nHer mother died when she was only five years old and initially her father, a liberal in politics and religion, brought the daughters up, taking a hand in their education. The family moved to Dalston in Middlesex, where they met the writer Harriet Martineau, who was struck by the two sisters and used them for her novel “Deerbrook”. In 1823, on a holiday in Scotland with friends of the radical preacher William Johnson Fox, the minister of South Place Unitarian Chapel, London, who was a frequent visitor to their home, Adam broke the female record for climbing up Ben Lomond. Back home, the girls became friends with the young poet Robert Browning, who discussed his religious doubts with Adam.\n\nAfter the father's death, about 1825, the sisters became members of the Fox household. Both sisters \nbegan literary pursuits, and Adam first fell ill with what became tuberculosis. Soon after, the sisters moved to Upper Clapton, a suburb of London. They attached themselves to the religious society worshipping in South Place, Finsbury, under the pastoral care of Fox. He encouraged and sympathized with the sisters, and they in turn helped him in his work. Eliza, the elder, devoted herself to enriching the musical part of the Chapel service, while Adams contributed hymns. Fox was one of the founders of the \"Westminster Review\". and his Unitarian magazine, the \"Monthly Repository\", printed essays, poems and stories by William Bridges Adams, polemicist and railway engineer, who Adam met at the house of her friend, the feminist philosopher Harriet Taylor Mill. The two married in 1834, setting up house at Loughton in Essex. In 1837, he distinguished himself as the author of an elaborate volume on \"English Pleasure Carriages\", and another on \"The Construction of Common Roads and Railroads\". He was also a contributor to some of the principal reviews and newspapers.\n\nEncouraged by her husband, Adams turned to acting and in the 1837 season at Richmond played Lady Macbeth, followed by Portia and Lady Teazle, all successes. Though offered a role at Bath, then a springboard for the West End, her health broke down and she returned to literature.\n\nIn 1841, she published her longest work, \"Vivia Perpetua, A Dramatic Poem\". In it, a young wife who refuses to submit to male control and renounce her Christian beliefs is put to death. She contributed to the \"Westminster Review\", including a critique of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poetry, and wrote political verses, some for the Anti-Corn Law League. Her work often advocated equal treatment for women and for the working class. At the solicitation of her pastor, she also contributed thirteen hymns to the compilation prepared by him for the use of his chapel, published 1840-41, in two parts, six in the first and seven in the second part. Of these, the two best known —\" Nearer, my God! to Thee,\" and \"He sendeth sun, he sendeth shower\"— are in the second part. For this work, her sister, Eliza, wrote sixty-two tunes. Her only other publication, a catechism for children, entitled \"The Flock at the Fountain,\" appeared in 1845. Her hymn, \"Nearer, my God! to Thee\", was introduced to American Christians in the \"Service Book,\" published (1844) by Rev. James Freeman Clarke, D.D., of Boston, Massachusetts, from where it was soon transferred to other collections. A selection of hymns she wrote, published by Fox, included her best-known piece, \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", reportedly played by the band as the RMS Titanic sank in 1912.\n\nA Unitarian in belief, her career was hampered by deafness she had inherited from her father and, inheriting their mother's feebleness, both sisters yielded to disease in middle age. Eliza, after a lingering illness, died in December 1846 and, worn down by caring for her invalid sister, Adam's health gradually declined. She died on 14 August 1848 at the age of 43 and was buried beside her sister and parents in the Forest Street cemetery near Harlow. At her grave was sung the only other hymn of hers which was widely known, “He sendeth sun, he sendeth shower”.\n\nA blue plaque honouring the husband and wife was placed at their Loughton home: they had no children. Richard Garnett wrote of her:— \"All who knew Mrs. Adams personally speak of her with enthusiasm; she is described as a woman of singular beauty and attractiveness, delicate and truly feminine, high-minded, and in her days of health playful and high-spirited.\"\n\n\n"}

She also achieved a personal best time of 3 minutes 22.66 seconds in the 200 metres freestyle. She was the SDSC's Sportswoman of the Year from 2004 to 2006.\n\nGoh took the top honours in the 100 metres breaststroke, 100 metres butterfly, 100 freestyle and 200 metres individual medley at the Danish Open in Esbjerg, Denmark, between 9 and 11 March 2007.

Despite not training intensively for the 4th ASEAN ParaGames held in Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat), Thailand, between 20 and 26 January 2008, and regarding the competition as part of her training for the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing in September, Goh broke the record she set in May 2007 at the German International Disability Swimming Championships to win the gold in the 50 metres breaststroke in a world and FESPIC record time of 52.62 seconds. She also achieved golds in the 100 metres breaststroke and 200 metres freestyle. In April, she participated in the US Paralympics Trials in Minneapolis. She took gold medals in the 100 metres breaststroke and the 50 metres and 200 metres freestyle, and achieved a FESPIC record time of 55.09 seconds in the heats of the 50 metres butterfly. She was one of three people given the Youth Inspiration Award at the Stars of SHINE Award 2008 organized by the National Youth Council and the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to recognize outstanding young people who have overcome personal difficulties and contributed to the community, and on 27 February 2008 received a special award at the SDSC's Sports Superstar Awards 2007 for outstanding achievements in swimming. In August 2008, Goh was conferred the \"Pingat Bakti Masyarakat\" (Public Service Medal) in the National Day Awards.\n\nGoh's personal best times as of September 2008 were 43.55 seconds for the 50 metres freestyle, 54.99 seconds for the 50 metres butterfly, 1 minute 32.92 seconds for the 100 metres freestyle, 1 minute 58.14 seconds for the 100 metres breaststroke, and 3 minutes 14.22 seconds for the 200 metres freestyle. As of 22 August 2008, Goh held the world record for the 50 metres and 200 metres breaststroke. She was ranked second in the world for the 100 metres breaststroke, third for the 200 metres individual medley, sixth for the 100 and 200 metres freestyle, seventh for the 50 metres butterfly and eighth for the 50 metres freestyle. Her current training schedule involves two-hour sessions at the Farrer Park Swimming Complex twice a day, except on Wednesday mornings and Sundays, which works out to about a week. She also works out in the gym three times a week.\n\nGoh was the flagbearer for Team Singapore at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, and competed in the 50 metres, 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle, and in the 100 metres breaststroke. On the first day of competition, 7 September, she finished sixth in the 100 metres freestyle but achieved two personal bests in the heats (1 minute 33.20 seconds) and finals (1 minute 32.92 seconds). Two days later she narrowly missed a bronze in the 200 metres freestyle, finishing fourth with a new personal best time and national record of 3 minutes 14.22 seconds. Her split time of 1 minute 32.54 seconds was also a new national record for the 100 metres freestyle. According to her coach, former Olympian Ang Peng Siong, her best chance of a medal lay in the 100 metres breaststroke. Her personal best time for this event is 1 minute 58.14 seconds, which she achieved in May 2007 at the International German Championships in Berlin. However, on 12 September, despite leading in the first 50 m with a split time of 53.26 seconds, she eventually finished fourth in a time of 2 minutes 1.99 seconds. Nonetheless, she looked forward to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, saying \"In another four years, another round. In Athens, I was fifth and, now, I'm fourth. The next time, hopefully, I won't be third but higher up.\" Unusually, in her final event, the 50 metres freestyle, she chose to use the breaststroke rather than the faster front crawl, finishing in 53.67 seconds and thus failing to qualify for the final. She said she did so to gain \"mental closure\" after having missed the bronze in the 100 metres breaststroke.\n\nAs of January 2008, Goh was employed by Standard Chartered Bank as a marketing services officer while on their Programme for Elite Athletes. She hopes to continue swimming full-time and to become a swimming coach.\n\nIn the 2016 Summer Paralympics, Goh won a bronze medal in the SB4 100m breaststroke final, with a time of 1 minute and 55.55 seconds. It was her first medal since her Paralympic debut in 2004. While qualifying for the finals, she set a new Asian record in the heats at 1 minute and 54.50 seconds.\n\n\n\n"}

They were told by his young son and daughter that their parents were not home, and left. They returned an hour later, and since the 32-year-old Carson was still not home, the men sat with his 11-year-old daughter watching television, until he returned, at which point they shot him in front of his child.

He was imprisoned in Monmouth County Gaol and placed on trial at the Shire Hall in Monmouth. He was sentenced to death for High Treason, but his sentence was commuted and he was sentenced to penal transportation to Australia for life.\n\nWhile in exile, members of the Chartist movement continued to advocate for the repatriation of the leaders of the Newport Rising. In March 1847, the House of Commons debated a proposal for their repatriation, but it was defeated by 196 votes to 31 (including the vote of Disraeli). The convicts won partial pardon in 1854 and total pardon in 1856. John Frost returned to England. Jones decided to remain behind in Australia and stuck by his watchmakers's trade. He died in poverty in 1873.\n\n"}
