{"id": "310656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310656", "title": "Akuma (Street Fighter)", "text": "Akuma (Street Fighter)\n\nAkuma (悪魔, Japanese for \"Devil\" or \"Demon\"), known in Japan as , is a fictional character from the \"Street Fighter\" series of fighting games by Capcom. Akuma made his debut in \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\" as a secret character and hidden Boss. In the storyline of the \"Street Fighter\" video games, he is the younger brother of Gouken, Ryu's and Ken's master. In some games he also has an enhanced version named Shin Akuma, or in Japanese. Since his debut, Akuma has appeared in several subsequent titles and has been well received by both fans and critics.\n\nAkuma made his debut in \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\", the fifth arcade iteration of the \"Street Fighter II\" games, where he appears as a hidden and unnamed character. After meeting certain requirements, Akuma appears prior to the player's final match with M. Bison and obliterates M. Bison before challenging the player. In the Japanese arcade version of the game, Akuma would introduce himself to the player before the match, proclaiming himself to be . He also has two endings in the game as well: one for defeating M. Bison, and another against himself. While these endings were omitted from the international releases of the arcade game, they were edited into one ending and included in the English localization of \"Super Turbo Revival\" for the Game Boy Advance. Shin Akuma is, however, an unlockable playable character in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival\", as well as the Japan-only Dreamcast version of the game, \"Super Street Fighter II X for Matchmaking Service\". In the latter version, another version of Akuma referred to as \"Tien Gouki\" can also be selected.\n\nAkuma appears in \"Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams\", where he was given his name, once again as a hidden opponent and unlockable character. His backstory remains the same as in \"Super Turbo\". Akuma was added to the immediate roster in \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\" and \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\", with a powered-up version of the character named \"Shin Akuma\" appearing as a hidden opponent. The character's relation with other \"Street Fighter\" characters begins to be fleshed out, establishing rivalries with Guy, Adon, Gen and Ryu. Shin Akuma, rather than \"Final Bison\", is Evil Ryu's final boss in the console versions of \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\".\n\nAkuma and Shin Akuma are featured in \"Street Fighter EX\" as hidden boss characters, where he is one of the few characters able to move out of the 2D playing field, during his teleport. Akuma also appears in the arcade and home video game console adaption of \"\" despite not appearing in the movie.\n\nAkuma is featured in the \"Street Fighter III\" sub-series beginning with \"\". Like in his debut in \"Super Turbo\", Akuma is both a secret opponent who serves as an alternate final boss and unlockable character, with the CPU-controlled version being the \"Shin Akuma\" incarnation introduced in \"Alpha 2\". He is a regular character in \"\". Akuma reappears in \"Street Fighter IV\", once again as a hidden boss in the Single Player Mode as well as an unlockable secret character in both the arcade and home console versions. Shin Akuma also returns as a hidden boss in \"Super Street Fighter IV\".\n\nBoth secret boss and playable versions of a new form of Akuma, known as , were confirmed in \"Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition\" by leaked videos. Unlike Shin Akuma, Oni is the being that would consume Akuma after mastering the Satsui no Hadou. Akuma returns in \"Street Fighter V\" as a downloadable character.\n\nAkuma has dark red hair, dark skin tone, glowing red eyes with black sclera, wears prayer beads around his neck, a dark gray karate gi and a piece of twine around his waist in lieu of an obi. The kanji \"ten\" (天) — meaning \"Heaven\" — can be seen on his back when it appears during certain win animations. Shin Akuma's appearance is very similar to Akuma's; for example, in the \"Street Fighter Alpha\" series, Shin Akuma had a purple karate gi instead of a dark gray one and marginally darker skin tone. Akuma's introduction in \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\" stemmed from the development team's desire to introduce a \"mysterious and really powerful\" character, with his status as a hidden character within the game resulting from later discussions. When asked regarding the presence of Akuma as a secret character in several of Capcom's fighting games, Capcom's Noritaka Funamizu stated that, while he did not personally support the concept, he said, \"Akuma is a character that can fit in any game design nicely\". Matt Edwards of Capcom Europe considered Akuma the most powerful \"Street Fighter\" character.\n\nAkuma's play style incorporates the trademark techniques of Ryu and Ken, the series' protagonists, only noticeably stronger in comparison along with additional techniques. Akuma has also been one of the characters with the lowest health and stun meter in most of the games he has appeared in. As the franchise expanded, the three characters have been differentiated somewhat while still retaining their common techniques (e.g. different regular attacks, throws, Super moves). In games where Akuma has appeared as a boss, he has had many upgrades, from extra meter to being able to use EX moves without meter at all. Rich Knight of \"Complex\" described Akuma as \"a character who must constantly be on the offense, because he takes a shit ton of damage when he's not.\"\n\nAkuma has appeared in some form or another through many Capcom games outside the \"Street Fighter\" franchise. The first of these appearances was in the fighting game \"\", where Akuma (in his \"Super Turbo\" incarnation) appears as a nameless hidden character. He would appear in the later Marvel-licensed fighting games (see \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" series). In \"X-Men vs. Street Fighter\", he is a regular character but–in a nod to his hidden character status in other games–his select box is hidden. In \"Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter\", he appears both as a selectable character and as \"Cyber Akuma\", a mechanized version enhanced by Apocalypse acting as the horseman of Death and the final boss. He is absent from \"\"; in his stead, Ryu has a Hyper Combo that changes his fighting style to incorporate Akuma's moveset. He reappears as a playable character in the sequels: \"\", \"\" and \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\". He is also an unlockable character in \"Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix\". He also appears in Namco x Capcom. He appears as both a playable character and one of the final boss characters in the crossover fighting game \"Street Fighter X Tekken\". Akuma also appears in the fighting video game \"Street Fighter X Mega Man\", as a hidden boss.\n\nIn the \"SNK vs. Capcom\" series, Akuma appears in \"Capcom vs. SNK\" and \"SVC Chaos\" as both regular Akuma and as a version of \"Shin Akuma\". In \"Capcom vs. SNK 2\", a different form of Shin Akuma appears. This form of Akuma achieves a new level of power when a dying Rugal Bernstein pours his Orochi power into him. His name is spelled in Japanese as , with the \"Shin\" character meaning \"God\" instead of the usual \"True\".\n\nAkuma also appears in \"Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo\" as the final boss, \"Pocket Fighter\", and in the Japanese console version of \"\" as a mecha named \"Zero Gouki.\" Also, various version of Akuma have appeared in the \"\" series. He is featured in a DLC episode of the action video game \"Asura's Wrath\", alongside Ryu as an opponent.\n\nAkuma appears as a special guest character in \"Tekken 7\". In the game's story, he seeks to repay a debt to Kazumi Mishima for saving his life from an unknown critical situation, who asks him to kill her husband Heihachi and his son Kazuya for her if she dies. When Heihachi is finally dead for good at the hands of Kazuya, he is Akuma's only target left. Similar to his appearances in the \"Street Fighter\" series, Akuma replaces Kazumi as a secret arcade mode final boss if certain conditions are met.\n\nAkuma made cameo appearances in \"\" and in the Japanese TV series \"Street Fighter II V\". Actor and martial artist Joey Ansah played Akuma in the short film \"\". Akuma also appears in \"\", an online series by Capcom and the creators of \"Street Fighter: Legacy\" with Ansah reprised his role from Legacy and Gaku Space as Young Gouki. In \"Assassin's Fist\", both of Akuma's names are used; Akuma being the moniker Gouki had assumed after the Satsui no Hado took him over completely. Both Ansah and Space will return for the second season titled \"Street Fighter: World Warrior\".\n\nAkuma's first speaking appearance in animation was in an episode of the American \"Street Fighter\" animated series titled \"Strange Bedfellows\". He reappears in another episode, \"The World's Greatest Warrior\", in which he defeats Ryu and Ken's master Gouken, and challenges Gouken's two students to a duel.\n\nAkuma also figures in the Japanese OVA \"\", where Ryu's encounters with Akuma triggers the \"Dark Hadou\" in Ryu. Akuma is also the central focus in the OVA \"\", which explores his past and ties the character's past with Ryu's. He appears in the beginning of the movie \"Street Fighter 4: The Ties That Bind\", where he enters Ryu's mind and torments him.\n\nUDON Entertainment's line of \"Street Fighter\" comics sets Akuma in his origin story on how he became a demon and murdering Goutetsu with the power of the Dark Hadou; he fights against Gouken ten years later, as they fight, Gouken eventually wins against Akuma as he falls off a cliff; Gouken tries to save him, but Akuma willingly drops himself into a river, only for him to survive the drop.\n\nIn July 2012, the band MegaDriver released a song about Akuma's character, called \"Wrath Of The Raging Demon\". In 2014, band Skelator released a song about Akuma, called \"Raging Demon\". In 2015, rapper Tauz released a tribute song to Akuma, called \"Rap do Akuma\". Akuma was featured in ScrewAttack internet series \"Death Battle\" where he fought against Shang Tsung from \"Mortal Kombat\". They fought a hypothetical battle, and Akuma defeated Shang Tsung with the Raging Demon. He was also featured in Death Battle spin-off series \"One Minute Melee\" where fought against Kenpachi Zaraki from \"Bleach\" in Season 1. He ended up winning when he sent Kenpachi flying with Demon Armageddon. They fought in a rematch in Season 2, and Akuma won again when he transformed into Oni and knocked Kenpachi out with Misogi. They fought in another and final rematch in Season 4, and Akuma was again victorious, when he, in Oni form, killed Kenpachi with Wrath of the Raging Demon. He was also featured in another Death Battle spin-off series \"DBX\" where he fought and won against Iron Fist from Marvel Comics.\n\n, also known as is a character who makes his debut in \"\" as a secret boss and a playable character. Oni is in fact Akuma, who has become one with the Satsui no Hado entirely.\n\nOni appears as a far more muscular and noticeably larger version of Akuma. He has dark blue skin, glowing yellow-red eyes, spiky shoulder-length hair, akin to the Super Saiyan of the \"Dragon Ball\" series. He also gains fangs and short protrusions on his forehead, resembling growing horns. The top half of his gi has been blown off by the amount of dark ki he emanates, showing off his musculature; the prayer beads that were once around his neck now float about disconnected around his body. He also has claws on his fingers and toes, and no longer wears sandals; his voice also sounds much more demonic. When using fierce attacks or powerful physical attacks of any kind, his arms and legs glow a superheated color. While it is difficult to spot, the kanji of \"heaven\" (天 ten) also appears on his back during the same animations, seemingly having branded itself on his back. Oni's moveset is similar to Akuma's but with additional moves and modifications. Oni can perform a fireball that disappears unless charged. To replace the Shankunetsu Hadouken, Oni has an electrical variant. His standing fierce punch cancels out fireballs. Added to Oni is a dashing spinning punch which can vary depending on what kick button is pressed. While jumping, Oni can do an evasive dash backward or forward or even perform a downward attack. He also uses an overhead smash attack. Oni's gameplay consists of high-damage combos and reversal potential, combined with his above-average walk speed, that allows players to create massive-pressure situations while remaining mobile and flexible via buffering moves into other attacks, although he has below-average stamina, stun and short-range Focus Attack.\n\nOni appears in the second half of the second DLC Lost Episode The Strongest vs. The Angriest of the video game \"Asura's Wrath\", given the epithet of \"Destroyer of Heaven\". A Pandora version of Oni appears in Akuma's ending in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\". He also appears as a playable character in strategic RPG \"Blood Brothers 2\". \n\nAkuma has received much critical acclaim from various gaming media outlets. Japanese magazine \"Gamest\" named him one of their \"Top 50 Characters of 1996\", in a three-way tie for 37th. He placed first in \"Game Informer's\" 2009 list of their \"Top Ten Best Fighting Game Characters\". Ryan Clements of IGN said in 2009: \"Although M. Bison might be thought of as a notorious \"Street Fighter\" villain, Akuma is clearly the fan-favorite 'bad guy'\". Elton Jones of \"Complex\" deemed Akuma the \"most dominant fighting game character\" in 2012: \"Anybody that can lay out M. Bison with ease gets the number-one spot in everything.\" \"GamesRadar\" said of the character in 2013: \"He differs from other villains in that his motives aren't inherently evil—but ... he has no qualms with killing his teacher or his own brother in combat.\" Alex Eckman-Lawn of \"Topless Robot\" deemed him the \"most diabolical\" fighting-game boss: \"Few experiences from the pre-Internet video-game era made as striking an impression as the time Akuma literally just glided in, murdered M. Bison in a blink, and challenged you, the player, to a real fight.\" Bryan Dawson of Prima Games commented, \"It's hard to imagine any new \"Street Fighter\" game without this man, as he adds a sense of evil that even M. Bison can't replicate.\" Dan Paradis of WatchMojo named Akuma \"The Best Secret Boss In Video Games\" in 2016: \"Since his initial appearance, Akuma has gone from secret to icon of the \"Street Fighter\" franchise.\" In 2018, the same site also named him \"the 9th best video game villain you liked more than the hero\", stating \"Despite calling himself “evil incarnate”, the fact he still abides by the moral code of the warrior gets him a certain amount of respect from fans. He’s much more than simply another Shotokan character.\"\n\nRobert Workman of \"GameDaily\" rated Akuma eleventh in his 2008 selection of the \"Top 25 Capcom Characters of All Time\", as he \"summons some of the sickest attacks ever seen in a fighting game.\" \"GameSpot\" readers chose Akuma for the ninth spot in their 2008 selection of the ten best video game villains, and the site itself deemed Akuma \"the toughest fighter\" in the \"Street Fighter\" series. Rich Knight of \"Complex\", in 2012, placed Akuma's \"SSFII Turbo\" appearance runner-up to Shao Kahn in \"Mortal Kombat II\" as the \"coolest boss battle ever\": \"Akuma rushed into our lives and onto the screen ... and then demolish[ed] you in seconds.\" Akuma placed 43rd in IGN's selection of the top 100 video game villains, for his \"always intimidating\" appearance. Tom Butler of \"WhatCulture\" named Akuma the top \"greatest unlockable gaming character\" in 2014, opining that fighting him \"can be an extremely challenging (and frustrating) exercise, and simply having the character unlocked was often an indicator of skill.\" WatchMojo named Akuma the seventh-best Capcom villain in 2015: \"When your name translates to 'devil' in Japanese, you’re probably not going to be the nicest guy in the world.\" Ben Lee of \"Digital Spy\" named him the sixth-best series character on the grounds that he was \"truly exciting to fight against\" in \"Super Street Fighter II Turbo\", \"and his cold, emotionless personality was utterly terrifying.\" \"Paste\" rated Akuma 23rd in their 2016 ranking of \"Street Fighter's\" 97 total playable characters, describing him as \"a great anti-hero to offset Ryu and Ken.\"\n\nChad Hunter of \"Complex\" ranked Akuma's \"Raging Demon\" among the \"25 Most Revolutionary Kill Moves in Video Games\" at third: \"Akuma radiates flames, grabs his opponent and the screen goes black and all you [hear] is a flurry of hits.\" Prima Games named it the seventh-\"greatest fighting move in video game history\" out of fifty in 2014, and \"Arcade Sushi's\" Angelo Dargenio considered it \"one of the most well-known super moves in videogame history, spawning several parody moves in multiple fighting games over the years.\" Gavin Jasper of \"Den of Geek\", in 2016, named Akuma in \"\" as the top fighting-game guest character, and while Jason Fanelli of \"Arcade Sushi\" considered it \"the best guest turn he's ever done,\" he simultaneously criticized his cameo in \"\": \"Akuma doesn't need to be a giant mech for extra exposure.\" Chris Hoadley of VentureBeat labeled Akuma one of the \"best fighting game clones\" in 2014: \"Capcom is no stranger to reusing [character] models. Ryu has had Ken as a rival since the first \"Street Fighter\", and over time he would meet more 'shotos' who had an affinity for karate \"gis\", fireballs, and uppercuts.\" \"GamesRadar's\" David Houghton rated Akuma's \"Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike\" stage among the \"27 most amazing fighting game backgrounds\": \"Gloomily ethereal, black-skied woodland setting with subliminally oppressive fisheye-lens effect? You are definitely going to die.\"\n\nHowever, Akuma has often been criticized for his perceived status as an excessively powerful character in the \"Street Fighter\" series. Scott Baird of \"Screen Rant\" named him the second-\"most unfairly overpowered fighting game character\" behind Meta Knight of \"Super Smash Bros.\" in 2016, for the potency of his offensive attacks that resulted in Akuma being banned from \"SSFII Turbo\" tournaments. \"GamePro\" considered Akuma one of the \"Most Broken Characters in Videogame History\", for his \"ridiculously powerful\" moves that were \"the bane of newbies and veterans alike,\" a sentiment that was echoed by Christopher Hooton of \"Metro\" in 2013. In 2013, Stephen Nadee of \"WhatCulture\" ranked Akuma as the second-worst boss in \"great\" fighting games: \"For balancing issues Akuma is usually given a paper thin defense since his introduction ... [but] give him to the AI and you’d have quite a fight on your hands.\" In 2014, Lucas Sullivan of \"GamesRadar\" ranked Akuma eleventh in his list of \"12 unfair fighting game bosses that (almost) made us rage quit\" in 2014. \"Even if you ever do manage to finally defeat Akuma, it somehow doesn't feel earned. It's more like the computer felt sorry for you.\" Additionally, Akuma was named by CBR as the \"Strongest Street Fighter character\", with comments \"In 1996’s \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\", Akuma evolved into a more powerful form, Shin Akuma, and he evolved into the even more powerful Oni in 2010’s \"Super Street Fighter IV\". Since he’s able to split mountains in that form, that version of Akuma stands as the most powerful being the Street Fighter universe.\"\n\nAkuma's Oni incarnation has received a mixed reception. Joe Pring of \"WhatCulture\" observed in 2015: \"Oni couldn't be more of a Marmite character, really. For every fan of Akuma's ascended form, there exists another that despises his very existence.\" WatchMojo ranked him as the ninth-\"Most Powerful Video Game Character\" in 2016: \"Possessing the stronger versions of all of Akuma's techniques, as well as even less humanity if that's possible, this is the closest a \"Street Fighter\" character actually gets to achieving godhood.\" Both characters shared the top spot in \"Screen Rant's\" rating of the \"12 Most Powerful \"Street Fighter\" Characters\" the same year. \"Akuma alone has destroyed an entire island, so whoever has to stand against the unbridled destructive force of Oni, all we can say is God help them.\" In another \"Screen Rant's\" list \"Street Fighter: 8 Most Powerful (And 8 Most Worthless) Characters\", Akuma placed first. \"Whether he is Oni, Akuma, or something in-between (Shin Akuma, for instance), the dark master easily proves that he is at the top of the SF heap in terms of both in-universe power and effectiveness among players who have mastered using him.\" However, Imran Khan of \"Paste\" rated Oni as one of the \"all-time worst\" series characters: \"Oni strips away the few bits of Akuma that are actually interesting as a character and turns him into a castaway from a \"Dragon Ball Z\" movie in design and development.\" Randolph Ramsay of \"GameSpot\" considered Oni \"one of the least interesting additions\" to \"Super Street Fighter IV\", as he utilized moves similar to those of other characters.\n\n"}

Thomas F. Wilson plays Biff in all three films as well as the Universal Studios ride, and voiced the character in the . He is the main antagonist of the first two films, and a villainous lesser character in the third film (which dealt with his great-grandfather).\n\nBiff is portrayed as a towering, violent and aggressive bully who obtains what he wants by intimidating others into doing his work for him, or by cheating. He and his family members are shown to misuse idioms in a way that makes them appear stupid and pathetic despite their intention to insult or scare. His favorite insult is \"butthead\".\n\nBiff was born in Hill Valley, California. He is the great-grandson of Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen and grandfather of Griff Tannen. Rather than studying in high school, he prefers to bully George McFly into doing his homework for him while he drinks and hangs out with his friends. Feared by most of his schoolmates, he is less brave without his gang (Match, Skinhead, and 3-D). The only person at Hill Valley High school that Biff is afraid of is Mr. Strickland. He has been living with his grandmother, Gertrude Tannen, at 1809 Mason Street for some time by November 1955.\n\nIn 1955, Biff had a crush on Lorraine Baines who does not return the sentiments. However, the alternate 1985 reveals that Lorraine, widowed after the murder of George McFly, ended up marrying Biff so her children could live a better life. In the original 1985, Biff's marital status is unknown as no mention of a wife was ever made in the trilogy.\n\nBy 2015, Biff has a teenage grandson, Griff, suggesting that Biff had at least one child by 1985. The animated series reveals that Biff has a son, Biff Jr.\n\nThe character is named for studio executive Ned Tanen following an incident years earlier where Tanen reacted aggressively to a script being pitched by the film's writers Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis. Tanen accused the two of attempting to produce an antisemitic work with their 1978 film \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\". Drafts of \"Back to the Future\" show Biff with the middle initial of \"H\", but this detail was omitted in further revisions.\n\nAs the films' important October 2015 date approached, commentators began noting the similarities between the older version of Biff Tannen and then presidential candidate Donald Trump. When the comparison was brought to Gale's attention in an interview, he stated that elements of Tannen's personality were actually based on Trump, who was already well known in the late 1980s for his work in real estate and tabloid controversies.\n\n"}

He was also head of the pre-1959 revolution Communist Party of Cuba for 28 years and editor of the communist newspaper \"Hoy\". He was a signatory of the Cuban Constitution of 1940 and chaired the committee that wrote the country's first socialist constitution in 1976.\n\nBlas Roca, born Francisco Calderio in Manzanillo, Cuba, a leading theoretician of the Cuban Revolution who led Cuba's pre-revolutionary Communist Party for 28 years, left school at the age of 11 and began shining shoes to help support his poor family. He changed his name to Roca, meaning 'rock', after he joined the Communist Party in 1929.\n\nIn 1929, he was elected Secretary General of the Union of Shoemakers of Manzanillo. In August 1931 he was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party and appointed head of his organization in the East. During this stage he displayed a wide journalistic activity in the labor press and led popular protests that culminated in the historic general strike of August 1933, which overthrew the Machado dictatorship.\n\nBlas had grown remarkably in a few years as result of his abilities and participation in intensive popular and workers' struggles. He was called to the capital at a time the party needed a strong guiding direction, and replaced the party leader and poet Rubén Martínez Villena, who would make his last public appearance in September 1933 at the burial of fellow communist Julio Antonio Mella's ashes. Thus, at 26 years of age, Blas had become the leader of the Cuban Communists and would remain so until the triumph of the Cuban Revolution. He is credited for shifting the party from an ultra left sect to an influential national organization.\n\nIn August 1935, Blas Roca attended the 7th Congress of the Communist International in Moscow, where Georgi Dimitrov outlined what became the new popular front strategy. Roca was instrumental in adapting the popular front to Cuban conditions. Originally identifying Fulgencio Batista with fascism, in 1938 at the Party's Tenth Plenary Assembly in Havana Blas Roca told the party leaders that circumstances had changed and Batista \"ceased to be the leading figure in the reactionary camp.\" According to K.S. Karol (Guerrillas in Power), Blas explained the threat of an economic and political crisis had split the Cuban Right into two camps: the fascists, who favored brute force to solve the crisis on the backs of the people, and the Batista forces who favored reforms and dialogue.\n\nAn alliance with the Batista forces led to the legalization of the communist-led Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC), the party daily \"Hoy\" and the party itself, then known as the Unión Revolucionaria Comunista (Revolutionary Communist Union). The alliance continued into the Constituent Assembly elections of 1939 in which the communists elected 6 delegates, led by Roca and Juan Marinello. Roca would serve 12 years in the legislature. The resulting Cuban Constitution of 1940, with Blas Roca as one of the signers, embodied many progressive and socialist provisions. In the following presidential election, the communists supported Batista's candidacy as part of his Democratic Socialist Coalition. Years later, when Batista accused Fidel Castro's revolutionaries of being communist led, Castro reminded readers of the magazine Bohemia that Batista had been endorsed by the communists in 1940 and that former party members were then serving in the Batista government.\n\nIn the 1930s, Roca's communist party also organized support for the Spanish Republic, with a formidable campaign that included not only moral and material assistance but also sending about a thousand Cuban combatants to the International Brigades.\n\nUnder Blas Roca's direction, Cuba's communist party grew in size and influence with key control over trade unions and other support organizations. During World War II, two communists served in Batista's war-time cabinet as ministers without portfolio, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez and Juan Marinello, both of whom would later serve in top positions under Fidel Castro. The party operated a popular radio station, Radio Mil Diez, and membership was in the tens of thousands.\n\nThe party's influence grew tremendously during the Second World War as the U.S. and Cuba were allied with the Soviet Union. Support for the party was strongest among Cuban intellectuals and artists, and counted among its members and sympathizers such notable Cubans as the novelist Alejo Carpentier, the poet Juan Marinello, who served as the party's chair, the painter Wifredo Lam, the national poet Nicolás Guillén, the writers Félix Pita Rodríguez, Mirta Aguirre, and Pablo de la Torriente Brau, and the economists Jacinto Torres and Raúl Cepero Bonilla. As Tad Szulc wrote in his biography of Fidel Castro about the Cuban communists, \"In truth, there were few creative personalities in Cuba since 1930 who were not on the left, or the extreme left\" (Fidel: A Critical Portrait, 1986, p. 131).\n\nDuring the 1940s, the Cuban Communists renamed the Popular Socialist Party (PSP) followed the lead of U.S. Communist leader Earl Browder. Following the Second World War, as tensions between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. intensified, the world communist movement condemned Browderism as a form of class collaboration and revisionism. The Cuban party, which under Roca's leadership had hewed closest to the Browder positions, such as forming a broad democratic alliance pushing policies to the left, denounced Browder and his views while remaining loyal to Stalinist principles.\n\nWith Batista's coup of March 10, 1952, the party now weakened under the anti-communist Carlos Prío Socarrás administration, condemned the actions. After Fidel Castro's July 26, 1953 attack on the Moncada army barracks, the Cuban communists condemned the attack as a \"putsch\" which did not involve mass struggle. At the time of the Moncada attack, party leaders were involved in a clandestine conference in Santiago and were also celebrating Roca's birthday (July 24). Batista quickly blamed the communist party for the \"criminal incident.\"\n\nAs the party's ability to operate openly was blocked, key leaders began to rethink their attitude towards Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement and the strategy of armed struggle.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the party went underground, and Blas Roca spent a whole year living in China in 1955-1956. Returning to Cuba with the victory of the revolution, Roca reorganized the party and firmly reoriented it under the leadership of Fidel Castro. In fact, Roca praised Castro for his armed strategy and criticized the party for failing to prepare for armed struggle. Blas Roca told the Eighth National Assembly of the PSP in August 1960:\n\n″We rightly foresaw, and greatly looked forward to, the prospect that in response to conditions created by the tyranny, the masses would organize and eventually engage in armed struggle or popular insurrection. But for a long time we failed to take any practical steps to hasten that prospect, because we believed that these struggles, including a prolonged general strike, would culminate in armed insurrection quite spontaneously. Hence, we did not prepare, did not organize or train armed detachments... That was our mistake. Fidel Castro's historical merit is that he prepared, trained, and assembled the fighting elements needed to begin and carry on armed struggle as a means of destroying the tyranny.″ (K.S. Karol, Guerrillas in Power, p. 149, footnote, 1970).\n\nUnder Roca's leadership the Cuban communists were instrumental in providing an organizational and ideological structure for Castro's socialist revolution as well as playing a pivotal role using the party's long-standing ties with the Soviet Union to promote increasingly closer ties during the early days of the revolution. In 1961, Blas Roca, leading a party delegation, presented a Cuban flag to Nikita Khrushchev during a meeting of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nShortly afterwards the communists dissolved into the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations, along with the 26th of July Movement and the Directorio Revolucionario, with communists holding at least 10 of the 24 National Directorate positions. Roca served on the first central committee and politburo of the new Communist Party of Cuba founded in 1965.\n\nRoca also served from 1976 through 1981 as president of the National Assembly of Popular Power, having chaired the committee that drafted the 1976 Cuban socialist constitution.\n\nHis remains were buried in a simple grave near the monument to Cuban independence leader Antonio Maceo just outside Havana.\n\nRoca's son, Vladimiro Roca, is an outspoken dissident and critic of the current Cuban party and government, arrested numerous times for his public activities advocating for democratic reforms.\n\nRoca wrote numerous books, articles and pamphlets before and after the revolution, including \"The Foundations of Socialism in Cuba,\" published in 1943. The book was the primary text used in educating communist party militants from the 1940s on. After the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, it was one of the main textbooks used by the Schools of Revolutionary Instruction (Escuelas de Instrucción Revolucionaria) to train leaders and party cadres in the newly-formed Integrated Revolutionary Organizations, the party merging the July 2nd Movement, the Popular Socialist Party and the Revolutionary Directorate, and eventually becoming the new Communist Party of Cuba in 1965.\n\n"}

Rocks crashed through the car's windscreen and crushed the infant's skull. Shoham died of severe brain damage on 11 July 2001.\n\nThis stoning attack and the infant's death, six days later, made headlines in Israel\nand, according to B'tselem, sparked a settler attack on two Palestinian villages, in which a Palestinian youth was shot while Israeli soldiers watched (or even participated).\nBoth incidents were part of a Second Intifada that started in September, 2000 and by 12 June 2001 had claimed the lives of 489 Palestinians and 109 Israelis.\n\nThe incident occurred as Benny and Batsheva Shoham and their only child Yehuda approached Eli after paying a shiva call in Ra'anana.\n\nNear Eli, Palestinians hiding at the roadside hurled rocks at the car which broke through the car's windscreen and crushed the infant's skull. The father continued driving, worried about an ambush, and at a nearby intersection, the couple noticed their baby's head injuries. Batsheva performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Yehuda until the arrival of paramedics.\n\nYehuda was taken to an intensive care unit at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where he lay unconscious and with severe head injuries. He was attached to a respirator for nearly a week before dying of severe brain damage on 11 July.\n\nDuring his time in the hospital, Yehuda's parents gave him a second name, \"Chaim,\" which means life, hoping that he would live. While in the hospital, Yehuda was visited by then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.\n\nThe Second Intifada, which began 8 months earlier, marked a period of intensified Palestinian-Israeli violence. On 22 May, Sharon declared a unilateral ceasefire and refrained from retaliating against Palestinian attacks. On Friday, 1 June, a suicide bombing outside a Tel Aviv disco occurred which killed 21 people, mainly Israeli teenagers who had immigrated from Russia. The day after, Saturday, June 2, Yasser Arafat's call for a cease-fire staved off Israeli retaliation.\n\nIn the meantime, Israel took a variety of measures to reduce tension, with Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer citing a \"significant reduction in the number of attacks\". Though Palestinians would be subject to strict closure confining them to their towns, Israel eased some travel restrictions and Palestinians were to be allowed to return from Jordan and Egypt, raw materials would be permitted to enter and exit the Palestinian territories, and Palestinians would be allowed to return to their jobs in an industrial zone near the Erez crossing point. Palestinian security commanders traveled to trouble spots in the Gaza Strip to consult with local officers over the cease-fire enforcement.\n\nWhen news of Yehuda's wounding spread on Tuesday, 5 June, Sharon began to be urged by far-right settlers to retaliate. The incident angered Israel's 200,000 settlers who urged Ariel Sharon to end Israel's \"policy of restraint\", and abandon the ceasefire. \"The Independent\" suggested that the incident would be cited by many Israelis as reason for stepping up military measures. The morning after Yehuda's wounding, at least 300 settlers, arriving in buses, assailed two villages adjacent to Shiloh, Assawiya, and Luban al-Sharkiya, which lay under curfew and within Israel's security responsibility, and, according to B'tselem, in the presence of, and according to local testimony, with the assistance of the IDF, fired a wheat harvest, a hothouse, a carpentry shop and a school, stole tools and shot a Palestinian youth in the stomach or the leg.\n\nThere were rock-throwing battles between settlers and Palestinians at the site of the attack on the Shohams' car during which one Israeli and seven Palestinians were injured. In addition, settlers in Hebron also attacked local Palestinian shopkeepers. The settlers had been a focal target of Palestinian militancy during an eight-month uprising. Two settlers were arrested by Israeli police as a result of the riots.\n\nThough reluctant to become involved in the conflict, the U.S. dispatched C.I.A. director George Tenet, who was scheduled to meet separately with the Israeli and Palestinian sides on Thursday, June 7, in order to re-establish co-operation on security issues between the two parties, which had broken down after the IDF had shot at the car of the Gaza Strip security chief Mohammad Dahlan in mid-April, and had fired on the home of their West Bank security chief Jibril Rajoub in late May.\n\nTenet's visit backed up an effort by the European Union to seize on Arafat's declaration in order to transform the ceasefire into a genuine halt to the reciprocal blood-letting. On Wednesday, 6 June, the eve of Tenet's scheduled visit, the IDF announced it would award medals to the commanders and troops serving at Netzarim Junction, where the child, Mohammed al-Dura had been shot dead. The news was seen as a blow to the restoration of trust. Thousands of demonstrators protested in Jerusalem against what they termed Sharon's \"restraint policy\". That same evening, Palestinians were outraged when Sharon called Arafat a \"murderer\" and \"pathological liar\" in an interview addressing the Russian community that had been angered at his failure to retaliate for the disco bombing. The broadcast was carried on Israeli television. Though given the red-carpet treatment abroad, he added, Arafat did not act like a head of state but rather like the chief of terrorists and murderers. \nOn Thursday, 7 June, speaking to reporters at a rally urging Ariel Sharon to retaliate for the attack on Yehuda and other recent attacks, Yehuda's father said \"Unfortunately, our government is showing a lot of weakness in its response to terrorism\". He also declared:This is our land, these are our roads, and if we are afraid of driving to Tel Aviv <nowiki>[</nowiki>Tel Aviv<nowiki>]</nowiki> and Netanya <nowiki>[</nowiki>Netanya<nowiki>]</nowiki> also.\n\nTenet’s meeting with both sides was postponed until Sunday, June 10, after the Americans realized the extent of their differences. Matters were buffeted by the killing of three Bedouin women, struck by Israeli tank shells while in their tents in the Gaza Strip over the weekend, and the critical injuries sustained by an Islamic Jihad member in a car-bombing, which the group suspected as being the work of Israel. He proposed that Israel desist from attacking Palestinian targets and withdraw to the positions they held on 28 September 2000. He asked Palestinians to thwart attacks on Israeli positions, to end what Israelis view as incitement in the media, and to proceed to arrest militant gunmen.\n\nOn Monday, 11 June, the day Yehuda died, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met the Palestinian minister for international co-operation, Nabil Shaath in Luxembourg to explore a compromise. Tenet eventually presided over a tense 4-hour meeting the following day, which was broken off after the gaps failed to be bridged. The Israelis insisted on the arrest of people they suspected of terrorism before they would allow a cooling-off period, while the Palestinians demanded that security arrangements be followed by an Israeli pledge to freeze to all construction in settlements in the occupied territories. The Palestinians refused to conduct what they called arbitrary arrests. The chief of staff of the Israeli army, General Shaul Mofaz, called the truce itself an optical illusion.\n\nThe funeral procession for Yehuda began with settlers gathering in front of Ariel Sharon's office in Jerusalem with the child's body carried before them. As Sharon stepped up to a podium to address them, settlers shouted \"Vengeance!\" and \"Go to war\". Prime Minister Sharon spoke to the funeral procession outside his office, and, acknowledging the settlers' impatience with a ceasefire, said:If we stand firm and grit our teeth, and carry on even when the tears are choking us, we will win... I am not here to make a speech, but to weep, to weep together with you. May the memory of Yehuda be blessed.\n\nSharon also asked for prayers for the infant, and accused the Palestinian Authority of inciting violence. From there the procession walked to the northern West Bank settlement of Shilo where Yehuda was buried. One of Yehuda's cousins said, \"Yehuda was just a baby, without sin or enemy, yet he was killed for one reason only, he was a Jew on his way home in Eretz Yisrael <nowiki>[</nowiki>Eretz Yisrael<nowiki>]</nowiki>.\" In a letter to the United Nations, Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations Yehuda Lancry outlined Israel’s position, which affirmed that the death of Yehuda Shoham constituted a “reprehensible act of terrorism” that took place just over two weeks after Israel had declared that it would refrain from initiating military action against Palestinians, and barely a week after Yassir Arafat had undertaken to fight violence and terrorism.\n\nIn Yehuda's memory, his parents decided to collect donations for dormitories at the yeshiva in Shiloh. His parents also established the Yehuda Fund in January 2002 \"in their son's memory.\"\n\n"}

The origin of the word 'deva' comes from the Sanskrit language. According to Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater devas represent a separate evolution to that of humanity. The concept of devas as nature-spirits was further developed in the writings of Theosophist Geoffrey Hodson. It is believed that there are numerous different types of devas with a population in the millions performing different functions on Earth to help the ecology function better. It is asserted they can be observed by those whose third eyes have been activated.\n\nIn addition, it is believed by Theosophists that there are millions of devas living inside the Sun, the indwelling solar deity of which Theosophists call the \"Solar Logos\"—these devas are called \"solar angels\", or sometimes \"solar devas\" or \"solar spirits\". Sometimes, it is believed, they visit Earth and can be observed, like other devas, by humans whose third eyes have been activated. Theosophists believe that there are also devas living inside all the other stars besides Sol; these are called \"stellar angels\".\n\nIn the Findhorn material, the term refers to archetypal spiritual intelligences behind species, in other words the group soul of a species.\n\nSome New Age sources use the term as a generic term to designate any being regarded as being composed of etheric matter--elementals, nature spirits (including the various types of nature spirits such as fairies, ondines, etc.).

Famous for his realistic and detailed style, he was an inspiration for later UK comic-book artists such as Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons and Chris Weston (indeed, Weston was taught by Lawrence), and influenced Indonesian artist Apri Kusbiantoro.\n\nBorn in East Sheen, a suburb of London, Lawrence was educated at St. Paul's School, Hammersmith. After joining the Army for his National Service, Lawrence used his gratuity to study art at Borough Polytechnic Institute (now the London South Bank University) but failed his final exams. Shortly before, a former student had visited the school to show students the work he was doing as a letterer on comic strips. Lawrence was inspired to take some samples to an editor at Amalgamated Press who suggested he try showing them to Mick Anglo, who ran a studio packaging comic strips for a London publisher and magazine distributor, Len Miller.\n\nLawrence worked for Anglo for four years, drawing the adventures of superhero \"Marvelman\" and various Western comic strips. After an argument with Anglo over pay rates, he found work with Odhams Press, drawing \"Wells Fargo\" for Zip, and with the Amalgamated Press (now renamed Fleetway Publications), contributing episodes of \"Billy the Kid\" to the comic Sun. When the ailing Sun merged with Lion, Lawrence switched to swashbuckling historical strips, \"Olac the Gladiator\", \"Karl the Viking\" and \"Maroc the Mighty (written by Michael Moorcock).\n\nA colour strip produced for \"Lion Annual 1965\" ('Karl the Viking and the Tideless Sea') led to Lawrence being offered colour work in Bible Story magazine and the sprawling science fantasy \"The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire\" which debuted in Ranger in 1965. Lawrence was to draw the strip in the pages of Ranger and Look and Learn until 1976.\n\nIn 1976 Lawrence attended the London comic book convention called \"Comics 101\", the first convention dedicated to British comic book creators. There he learned that The Trigan Empire was syndicated all over Europe. When his publisher refused to give him any form of royalties or compensation, he departed from his old employer and was immediately offered work on a new Dutch comic called \"Eppo\". After an abortive start on a strip entitled \"Commander Grek\" written by his friend Vince Wernham, Lawrence found success with \"Storm\". The first volume, \"The Deep World\", was based on a concept by Martin Lodewijk but written by Philip Dunn. A further 22 volumes followed.\n\nLawrence did not limit himself solely to Trigan Empire and Storm and other strips he drew include \"Fireball XL5\" and \"The Adventures of Tarzan\" for TV Century 21, \"Carrie\" for the men's magazine Mayfair and a number of one-off strips for various Dutch publishers.\n\nA number of partly completed and unpublished comic strips appeared in the series Don Lawrence Collection, published in the Netherlands. The final Storm serial (completed by Lawrence's former assistant Liam Sharp appeared in the magazine \"Pandarve\" published by the Don Lawrence Fanclub in 1999–2001. One of his last illustrations was the cover of volume 6 of the Storm -the collection- from 2002.\n\nIn the mid 80s he was looking for an assistant and accepted then 17-years old Liam Sharp as his apprentice, but after realizing he did not want to step back as much as he had though he would, he helped Sharp develop his own style.\n\nIn 1995, he lost sight of his right eye, caused by an infection after an unsuccessful cataract operation. With his depth perception gone, he could no longer see when the tip of his pen and brush touched the paper's surface, forcing him to teach himself an alternative drawing technique.\n\nHe went through a new cataract operation in 1999, this time without medical complications. But his general health was starting to decline, and when he was diagnosed with emphysema and put on medication, he permanently retired from comics and art.\n\nLawrence died in December 2003 of emphysema at the age of 75.\n\n\nComics work published in English include:\n\n"}

Dumont was well known for his movements within the North-West Rebellion at the Battles of Batoche, Fish Creek, and Duck Lake as well as for his role in the signing of treaties with the Blackfoot tribe, the traditional main enemy of the Métis.\n\nDumont was born to Isidore Dumont and Louise Laframboise in 1837 in Red River. Growing up Dumont had little in the way of education – he was illiterate but could speak seven languages. In the early stages of his life, Dumont relied on buffalo hunting in order to gain a source of food. His family made a living through hunting buffalo and trading with the Hudson's Bay Company. After his time leading the Métis people alongside Louis Riel, Dumont spent time travelling throughout the United States where he spoke at public speaking events and political campaigns. In 1889 he dictated his memoirs in Quebec.\n\nDumont known throughout the Métis community for his various political and military endeavours. Among his chiefest political campaigns was the severing of a treaty between the Métis and the Dakota in 1882. Just one year later, Dumont was elected hunt chief of the Saskatchewan Métis. Dumont was known as the adjutant general of the Métis people – he played a large role in the well-being of the Métis community and their subsequent resistance against the Canadian government during the North-West Rebellion. Dumont also figured prominently in the Duck Lake conflict, as well as the battles of Fish Creek and Batoche\n\nDumont's legacy is marked by his grave in Batoche, as well as through his mark on the Métis people. Gabriel Bridge, a bridge that spans the Saskatchewan River, is named after Dumont, as are several research institutions and schools. In addition, many books and poems have been written about Dumont's life, his works, and his legacy as a political figure.\n\nDumont was the grandson of the French-Canadian commoner Jean-Baptiste Dumont and his First Nation wife Josette of the Tsuu T’ina-Crow tribe. His parents were Isidore Dumont (known commonly as Ekapow) and Louise Laframboise, who made their home in the Red River Colony. Dumont was born as the fourth child, the eldest son of eleven children to Isidore and Louise in the year 1837 in what is now known as Winnipeg. His indigenous background signalled that Dumont's early life was often marred by a lack of education, considering the circumstances of his family this was not entirely uncommon. He spent the majority of his childhood travelling across the prairie following the bison and learning the skills to become a hunter.\n\nThe Dumont family was known throughout the settlement of Red River as a prominent Métis buffalo hunting family. In addition to this distinction, they held a long-vaunted relationship with the Saskatchewan area as leaders of a brigade. The Dumont family made their fortune through hunting in the lands controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company, with the primary source of their income coming through the trade of pemmican with the company. Dumont was introduced to the art of Métis buffalo hunting in his childhood years, and over time mastered the nuances of prairie life. This would equip him in the years to come for the conflict he would endure.\n\nMadeline Welke – the daughter of a Scottish trader and his Indian wife – married Dumont in 1858. Throughout his travels as a hunter, Dumont traded with different tribes and picked up different languages making him more valuable to his tribe. In 1868, Dumont and his wife settled in the Batoche area permanently.\n\nDumont was known for his incredible versatility both as a huntsman and as a convenor of multilingualism. It was purported that Dumont could converse with an individual in no less than seven separate languages (although it was noted that Dumont never learned more than a few small phrases in English). His skills as a huntsman and marksman were another finely honed trait, in both the disciplines of bow and rifle. In addition to these traits, Dumont was known as a proficient horseman. In much the same vein as many of the other prominent Métis leaders of his day such as Louis Riel, Dumont had mastered the fine art of diplomacy in the northern plains of the West.\n\nDumont was first introduced to plains warfare at the young age of 13 in 1851, where he fought in the Battle of Grand Coteau against the much larger contingent of Yankton Sioux. Dumont's actions in that conflict including defending a large Métis encampment against the advances of a Dakota war party.\n\nIn 1862 at the age of 24, Dumont served as the intermediary between the Métis and the Dakota whilst being accompanied by his father. Later on, Dumont helped to sign a treaty with the Blackfoot, an action that led to a long state of peace with the traditional enemies of the Métis.\n\nAlthough he was considered one of the figureheads of the Métis movement at the time, Dumont was not involved in the Red River Resistance that took place from 1869-1870. However, Dumont did move quickly to Fort Garry in order to offer his military assistance during Colonel Garnet Wolseley's movement on the area.\n\nAround the time of 1885, the North-West Rebellion broke out. Dumont's army of 300 Métis soldiers organized near Duck Lake on the 26th of March, and conflict broke out between the ranks of the Métis and the North-West Mounted Police later that day. Among the dead on the Métis side was Dumont's brother, Isidore – the victim of a botched parley attempt. Dumont was dealt a glancing blow to his head from a stray bullet during the battle, cutting an artery and was thereafter confined to nursing his injury while the rest of the North-West Resistance played out. However, this injury suffered during the Duck Lake confrontation did not prevent Dumont from leading his soldiers.\n\nDumont also played a key role in discovering the traitors within the Saskatchewan Métis. In particular, Dumont was a part of the arrest of Alexander Monkman. Dumont ensured the safety of Louis Riel by jumping in front of Monkman's revolver when he pulled it on Riel, leading to Monkman's quick arrest. Dumont was acutely aware that more Canadian troops led by General Frederick Middleton were streaming towards their location. In order to combat the advancing threat, Dumont proposed a campaign of terror that focused on uprooting railroads and prolonged periods of violence against Canadian soldiers. Riel was more inclined towards a peaceful resolution to proceedings, and Dumont deferred to Riel's judgements.\n\nDumont's contingent of 300 Métis soldiers clashed with the opposing Canadian soldiers on the 24th of April at a place dubbed Fish Creek by the Canadians. The valiant efforts of the Métis soldiers caused General Middleton to pause in his advancement towards Batoche. With the battle only lasting one day, the Métis soldiers were outnumbered five to one. Dumont's skillful military leadership allowed them to drive off the attackers and enabled the Métis soldiers to eventually retreat to the relative safety of Batoche. Once the Canadian soldiers reached Batoche, Dumont led a valiant defence of the Métis community that lasted four days. After the first day there was no clear winner amongst the two sides, despite the Métis being once again vastly outnumbered. Although they lacked the numbers to truly put a dent in the Canadian forces, Dumont's group handicapped a military steamer and managed to repel several of Middleton's infantry pushes. The Métis utilized the tactic of digging holes approximately every seventy-five meters to allow for the Métis troops to hide and advance throughout a vast majority of land, allowing for a place to watch the English and easily attack. By the fourth day of the defence, the Métis soldiers were out of ammunition and shooting nails and pieces of metal. That day, the Canadian soldiers broke through Dumont's lines and took Batoche. Many Métis were saved because of the holes that were previously dug. For days afterwards, Dumont remained in the vicinity of Batoche to ensure that blankets were distributed to the now homeless Métis women and children. During this period Dumont also searched for Riel, who had surrendered to the Canadian soldiers in the interim on May 15. When Dumont learned of Riel's fate, he quickly left Batoche and travelled to the United States.\n\nAfter crossing the border into the United States via the Cypress Hills in Montana, Dumont and his companion Michel Dumas were detained almost immediately. However, Dumont and Dumas were quickly released following a memo sent from the Oval Office ordering their release immediately. Although Dumont hid for some time in the United States, he was still wanted in Canada and had developed into something of a folk hero in Saskatchewan. While Dumont was indeed in hiding, it was rumoured that the soldiers looking for him made a rather feeble attempt to find him after learning that \"le petit\", his famous rifle, was still in his possession.\n\nIn July 1886 the Canadian government made the announcement that there was an amnesty made available to Dumont. He eventually returned to Batoche, where he spent time dictating two separate memoirs of the North-West Resistance.\n\nDumont's hereditary skills gained from his heritage as a buffalo hunter quickly gave rise to his influence politically. By the year 1863, the ranks of the buffalo hunters amongst the Saskatchewan Métis numbered around 200 – enough to require some form of formal organization. In 1863 he was first elected as the hunt chief of the Saskatchewan Métis, a position he remained in until 1881 – around the time that the buffalo herds had almost entirely disappeared from the region that Dumont was hunt chief of. Dumont's experience on the buffalo hunt gave him a great vision for the downturn of the buffalo trade during the 1870s.\n\nHe was known as a leader with a vision for the Métis, as he recognized that the declining numbers of the buffalo in Western Canada coupled with the encroaching Canadian agricultural movement spreading from the east would spark a great amount of change on the prairies. His political agenda consisted of maintaining the independence of the Saskatchewan Métis both politically and economically. In December 1873, after a meeting Dumont called in order to form a government for the Métis at St. Laurent (De Grandin), Dumont was immediately elected leader of the council of St. Laurent. Through his position as the leader of the council, Dumont created and put into place a constitution for the Métis that was followed for some time afterwards.\n\nIn his role as president of the council, Dumont's responsibilities included overseeing a committee of elected Métis councillors, and mediating relations between the council and the people of St. Laurent. During this period of time the Canadian government had begun to lay claim to the position of governing body in the region, which sparked conflict with Dumont and his council. At first Dumont was passive, informing the government that the purpose of the local government was simply that – to govern locally. The goal of the council was not to form a rebellion according to Dumont. Reassured by Dumont's implorements, colonial officials saw little cause to panic.\n\nIncidentally however, Dumont did seek a degree of complete authority. When land surveyors from the Canadian government began to arrive in Saskatchewan during the 1870s, they showed a complete lack of regard for the Métis system of land tenure When the North-West Mounted Police arrived on the plains in 1874, it proved the volatility of the situation – Sir John A. Macdonald's government had no plans to treat the Métis as a self-governing entity.\n\nDumont was re-elected president and leader of the council at St. Laurent in December 1874. In order to ensure that order was kept in the region, Dumont's government attempted to impose fines on Métis who ignored the rules of the buffalo hunt. These individuals did not appreciate the tactics Dumont's government was employing, and complained to the Hudson's Bay Company factor Lawrence Clarke. Clarke sent their concerns on to Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris, claiming that the Métis were in open revolt against Ottawa. After this incident the North-West Mounted Police were dispatched to investigate, and found no issue with Dumont's dealings. However, the incident did spell the virtual end of the rule of the governing council at St. Laurent, although the council itself remained.\n\nDuring the 1880s Dumont's council sent petitions to the capital in Ottawa imploring the government to recognize the traditional land holdings (tenure) of the Métis. When these petitions went unanswered by the prime minister and his cabinet, Dumont and the Métis felt compelled to protect the land through a more direct method. In March 1884, a meeting was called by Dumont at the house of Abraham Montour, in which Dumont proceeded to call for Louis Riel to take up the mantle of leadership that Dumont had been previously holding. Subsequently, a delegation consisting of Dumont and three of his closest companions was sent to Riel requesting that he travel to Saskatchewan in order to provide insight into how best to protect Métis lands and freedoms. Dumont and three others travelled to St. Peter's Jesuit Mission in Montana, and convinced Riel to ride north to Saskatchewan. From that point onwards, Dumont and Riel maintained a close friendship.\n\nIn March 1885, Dumont called a general meeting of the Métis of St. Laurent at Batoche. During the meeting, several of the indigenous people present suggested a more violent approach to proceedings – defending their lands against the Canadian government through the use of arms. By the conclusion of the meeting, a new provisional government had been formed led by Dumont, known as the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. This new government served as a direct competitor to Ottawa's rule. Dumont was chosen to be the adjutant governor of this new government. While Riel was officially the figurehead and overruled Dumont in terms of decision power, Dumont remained responsible for many of the Métis political and military decisions until his retirement from active governing duty.\n\nDuring the years of the 1870s and the 1880s, Dumont owned a farm near the South Saskatchewan River, where he chose to spend his days working said farm and operating a ferry across the South Saskatchewan nicknamed \"Gabriel’s Crossing\" around ten kilometres upstream from the ferry that Francois Xavier Letendre dit Batoche began around the same time. Dumont and his wife Madeleine were among the many Métis families that had been pushed out of Manitoba by the Canadian government.\n\nIn June 1886, Dumont was briefly employed in a western show named Buffalo Bill's Wild Wild West Show, where he was billed as a desperado and a crack shot until the latter half of the summer when he travelled to the northeastern States to engage in public speaking events and political campaigns. Dumont soon grew tired of politics and returned to the Wild Wild West Show before settling down at a relative's property to return to hunting, fishing and trapping in 1903. He passed away at the age of sixty-eight on the 19th of May 1906 in Batoche, the result of a tragic heart failure.\n\nThe legacy of Dumont as a Métis leader is one that is only outshone by that of Louis Riel. Gabriel Dumont has left a legacy behind that is known through schools, museums, institutions, books and landmarks. In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed at Duck Lake, that \"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the Prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\" Batoche – the site of a Métis Provisional Government, has been declared a National Historic Site.\n\nThe Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research in Saskatchewan was named in his honour when it was founded in 1980. In 1985, a scholarship fund was formed in his name with a 1.24 million dollar capital investment. In 1993, an agreement was set up between the institute and the University of Saskatchewan creating the Gabriel Dumont College. The Gabriel Dumont Bridge was built in 1969 over the South Saskatchewan River east of Rosthern, Saskatchewan. It is located at the site of Gabriel's Crossing, where he ran a small store, billiards hall, and ferry service in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In 1998, the public French-first-language high school in London, Ontario, was renamed École secondaire Gabriel-Dumont in Dumont's honour.\n\n\n"}

His rise as a playwright in the 1960s, marked the coming of age of modern Indian playwriting in Kannada, just as Badal Sarkar did in Bengali, Vijay Tendulkar in Marathi, and Mohan Rakesh in Hindi. He is a recipient of the 1998 Jnanpith Award, the highest literary honour conferred in India.\n\nFor four decades Karnad has composed plays, often using history and mythology to tackle contemporary issues. He has translated his plays into English and has received acclaim. His plays have been translated into some Indian languages and directed by directors like Ebrahim Alkazi, B. V. Karanth, Alyque Padamsee, Prasanna, Arvind Gaur, Satyadev Dubey, Vijaya Mehta, Shyamanand Jalan, Amal Allana and Zafer Mohiuddin. He is active in the world of Indian cinema working as an actor, director and screenwriter, in Hindi and Kannada cinema, and has earned awards. He was conferred Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan by the Government of India and won four Filmfare Awards, of which three are Filmfare Award for Best Director – Kannada and the fourth a Filmfare Best Screenplay Award.\n\nGirish Raghunath Karnad was born in Matheran, in present-day Maharashtra, in 1938. His mother Krishnabai née Mankikar was a young widow with a son, and while training to be a nurse, met Dr. Raghunath Karnad who was a doctor in the Bombay Medical Service. For five years they could not get married because of the prevailing prejudice against widow remarriage. Finally their marriage was sanctified under the dispensation of the Arya Samaj. Girish was the third of the four children born thereafter.\n\nGirish Karnad's initial schooling was in Marathi. In Sirsi, Karnataka, he was exposed to travelling theatre groups, Natak Mandalis, as his parents were deeply interested in their plays. As a youngster, Karnad was an ardent admirer of Yakshagana and the theater in his village. His family moved to Dharwad in Karnataka when he was 14 years old, where he grew up with his two sisters and niece.\n\nHe earned his Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and statistics from Karnatak Arts College, Dharwad (Karnataka University), in 1958. Upon graduation Karnad went to England and studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Magdalen in Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar (1960–63), earning his Master of Arts degree in philosophy, political science and economics. Karnad was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1963.\n\nAfter working with the Oxford University Press, Chennai for seven years (1963–70), he resigned to take to writing full-time. While in Madras (now known as Chennai) he got involved with local amateur theatre group, The Madras Players.\n\nDuring 1987–88, he was at the University of Chicago as visiting professor and Fulbright playwright-in-residence. During his tenure at Chicago \"Nagamandala\" had its world premiere at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis based on Karnad's English translation of the Kannada original. Most recently, he served as director of the Nehru Centre and as Minister of Culture, in the Indian High Commission, London (2000–2003).\n\nHe served as director of the Film and Television Institute of India (1974–1975) and chairman of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, the National Academy of the Performing Arts (1988–93).\n\nKarnad is known as a playwright. His plays, written in Kannada, have been translated into English and some Indian languages. Kannada is his language of choice.\n\nWhen Karnad started writing plays, Kannada literature was highly influenced by the renaissance in Western literature. Writers would choose a subject that looked entirely alien to manifestation of native soil. C. Rajagopalachari's version of the \"Mahabharata\" published in 1951, left a deep impact on him and soon, sometime in the mid-1950s, one day he experienced a rush of dialogues by characters from the Mahabharata in Kannada. \"I could actually hear the dialogues being spoken into my ears ... I was just the scribe,\" said Karnad in a later interview. \"Yayati\" was published in 1961, when he was 23 years old. It is based on the story of King Yayati, one of the ancestors of the Pandavas, who was cursed into premature old age by his preceptor, Shukracharya, who was incensed at Yayati's infidelity. Yayati in turn asks his sons to sacrifice their youth for him, and one of them agrees. It ridicules the ironies of life through characters in \"Mahabharata\". It became an instant success, immediately translated and staged in several other Indian languages.\n\nKarnad found a new approach of drawing historical and mythological sources to tackle contemporary themes and existentialist crisis of modern man through characters locked in psychological and philosophical conflicts. His next was \"Tughlaq\" (1964), about a rashly idealist 14th-century Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad bin Tughluq, and allegory on the Nehruvian era which started with ambitious idealism and ended up in disillusionment. This established Karnad, now 26 years old, as a promising playwright in the country. It was staged by the National School of Drama Repertory under the direction of Ebrahim Alkazi, with the actor Manohar Singh, playing the visionary king who later becomes disillusioned and turns bitter, amidst the historic Purana Qila in Delhi. It was staged in London by the National School of Drama for the Festival of India in 1982.\n\n\"Hayavadana\" (1971) was based on a theme drawn from \"The Transposed Heads\", a 1940 novella by Thomas Mann, which is originally found in the 11th-century Sanskrit text \"Kathasaritsagara\". Herein he employed the folk theatre form of Yakshagana. A German version of the play was directed by Vijaya Mehta as part of the repertoire of the Deutsches National Theatre, Weimar.\n\n\"Naga-Mandala\" (Play with Cobra, 1988) was based on a folk tale related to him by A. K. Ramanujam, brought him the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award for the Most Creative Work of 1989. It was directed by J. Garland Wright, as part of the celebrations of the 30th anniversary of Guthrie Theatre, Minneapolis. The theatre subsequently commissioned him to write the play, \"Agni Mattu Male\" (The Fire and the Rain). Though before it came \"Taledanda\" (Death by Beheading, 1990) which used the backdrop, the rise of Veerashaivism, a radical protest and reform movement in 12th century Karnataka to bring out current issues.\n\nKarnad made his acting as well as screenwriting debut in a Kannada movie, \"Samskara\" (1970), based on a novel by U.R. Ananthamurthy and directed by Pattabhirama Reddy. That movie won the first President's Golden Lotus Award for Kannada cinema.\n\nIn television, he played the role of Swami's father in the TV series \"Malgudi Days\" (1986–1987), based on R. K. Narayan's books. He also hosted the science magazine Turning Point on Doordarshan, in the early 1990s.\n\nHe made his directorial debut with \"Vamsha Vriksha\" (1971), based on a Kannada novel by S. L. Bhyrappa. It won him National Film Award for Best Direction along with B. V. Karanth, who co-directed the film. Later, Karnad directed several movies in Kannada and Hindi, including \"Godhuli\" (1977) and \"Utsav\" (1984). Karnad has made number of documentaries, like one on the Kannada poet D. R. Bendre (1972), \"Kanaka-Purandara\" (English, 1988) on two medieval Bhakti poets of Karnataka, Kanaka Dasa and Purandara Dasa, and \"The Lamp in the Niche\" (English, 1989) on Sufism and the Bhakti movement. Many of his films and documentaries have won several national and international awards.\n\nSome of his famous Kannada movies include \"Tabbaliyu Neenade Magane\", \"Ondanondu Kaladalli\", \"Cheluvi\" and \"Kaadu\" and most recent film \"Kanooru Heggaditi\" (1999), based on a novel by Kannada writer Kuvempu.\n\nHis Hindi movies include \"Nishaant\" (1975), \"Manthan\" (1976), \"Swami\" (1977) and \"Pukar\" (2000). He has acted in a number of Nagesh Kukunoor films, starting with \"Iqbal\" (2005), where Karnad's role of the ruthless cricket coach got him critical acclaim. This was followed by \"Dor\" (2006), \"8 x 10 Tasveer\" (2009) and \"Aashayein\" (2010). He played a key role in movies \"Ek Tha Tiger\"(2012) and its sequel \"Tiger Zinda Hai\"(2017) produced by Yash Raj Films.\n\nKarnad has acted in the Kannada gangster movie \"Aa Dinagalu\".\n\nHe provided the voice of A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, former President of India, in the audiobook of Kalam's autobiography by Charkha Audiobooks \"Wings of Fire\".\n\nUniversity of Southern California, Los Angeles – 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Tata Literary Festival held in Mumbai in 2012, Karnad was invited to speak about \"his life in theater\" in an hour-long session. Instead of talking about the subject, he took the opportunity to lash out at V. S. Naipaul for his \"antipathy towards Indian Muslims\". V. S. Naipaul had earlier been conferred the Lifetime achievement award by the festival's organisers. Karnad also criticized the organizers for having honored Naipaul.\n\nThe audience, which had gathered to hear Karnad speak, had mixed reactions to the speech. Some, like organizer Anil Dharker, tried ineffectually to steer the speech toward less controversial waters. Others were amused by the episode, and some commented on the research and logic that had gone into the speech (unfortunately overshadowed by its 'scandalous' nature).\n\nJust a few weeks after this, Karnad again created controversy by claiming that Rabindranath Tagore was a second-rate playwright and that his plays were \"unbearable\".\n\nIn November 2015, during celebrations marking the anniversary of 18th-century Muslim ruler Tipu Sultan's birth, Karnad stated that Bangalore International Airport should have been named after Tipu Sultan instead of Kempe Gowda. This created a furore among right-wing groups. Karnad apologised the following day.\n\nKarnad is married to Dr. Saraswathy Ganapathy and they have two children. He lives in Bangalore. Girish Karnad, while working in Madras for Oxford University Press on his return from England, met his future wife Saraswathi Ganapathy at a party. They decided to marry but the marriage was only formalised ten years later, when Karnad was 42 years old. Saraswathi was born to a Parsi mother, Nargis Mugaseth, and a Kodava father, Kodandera Ganapathy.\n\nHe is a proponent of multi-culturalism and freedom of expression, Girish Karnad has been a critic of religious fundamentalism and Hindutva in India. He publicly condemned the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 and later spoke against the attempts to create controversy about the Idgah Maidan in Hubli. He is a proponent of secularism and has opposed RSS, BJP and other Hindu organizations on several occasions. He opposed Narendra Modi for the Prime Minister's post in the 2014 parliament elections.\n\n\n\n2. Indradhanush (1989) as Appu and Bala's Father\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the foremost scholars in the field of Austronesian linguistics, publishing extensively on the reconstruction of Proto-Austronesian phonology and on subgrouping within the language family, the latter principally by means of lexicostatistics.\n\nThe youngest son of a rabbi and his wife who had immigrated from Kiev, Ukraine, \"Iz\" (as he was known to friends) grew up speaking Yiddish at home and studying Hebrew at Gratz College in preparation for rabbinical training. However, during the course of earning a B.A. in 1933, an M.A. in 1934, and a Ph.D. in 1939 at the University of Pennsylvania, his interests shifted to comparative linguistics. After completing a dissertation on \"The Sanskrit indeclinables of the Hindu grammarians and lexicographers\" he planned to specialize in Slavic languages, but the needs of the U.S. Army during World War II drew him into languages in the Pacific Theater of Operations.\n\nHe learned Malay well enough to teach it to troops headed for the Southwest Pacific and to produce a 2-volume pedagogical text, \"Spoken Malay\" (1943). After the war, he did fieldwork on two more genetically and typologically disparate Austronesian languages, Chuukese (rendered as \"Trukese\" at that time) and Yapese, as a member of the Tri-Institutional Coordinated Investigation of Micronesian Anthropology sponsored by Yale University, the University of Hawaii, and the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. Out of this came his \"A Sketch of Trukese grammar\" (1965).\n\nAt the same time, he began applying his comparative method to revise and elaborate phonological reconstructions that had earlier been published by Otto Dempwolff (1934–38). A series of articles such as \"The Malayo-Polynesian word for ‘two’\" (1947), \"The Tagalog reflexes of Malayo-Polynesian D\" (1947), \"Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *Z\" (1951), and \"Dempwolff’s *R\" (1953), eventually culminated in a monograph, \"The Proto-Malayo-Polynesian laryngeals\" (1953). His application of the same methods to his own new data from Chuukese led to a monograph \"On the history of the Trukese vowels\" (1949), which brilliantly demonstrated how the nine vowels of Chuukese had derived quite regularly from the four-vowel system Dempwolff had reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian.\n\n"}

He also served as a senior officer of the Confederate States Army in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War.\n\nChesnut, a lawyer prominent in South Carolina state politics, served as a Democratic senator in 1858-60, where he proved moderate on the slavery question. But on Lincoln’s election in 1860, Chesnut resigned from the U.S. Senate and took part in the South Carolina secession convention, later helping to draft the Confederate States Constitution.\n\nAs aide to General P.G.T. Beauregard, he ordered the firing on Fort Sumter and served at First Manassas. Later he was aide to Jefferson Davis and promoted to Brigadier-General. Chesnut returned to law practice after the war.\n\nHis wife was Mary Boykin Chesnut, whose published diaries reflect the Chesnuts' busy social life and prominent friends such as John Bell Hood, Louis T. Wigfall, Wade Hampton III, and Jefferson Davis.\n\nJames Chesnut Jr., was born the youngest of fourteen children and the only (surviving) son of James Chesnut Sr. (1775–1866) and his wife, Mary Cox (1777–1864) on Mulberry Plantation near Camden, South Carolina. Chesnut Sr. was one of the wealthiest planters in the South, who owned 448 slaves and many large plantations totaling nearly five square miles before the outbreak of the Civil War. Chesnut Jr. graduated from the law department of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1835, and initially rose to prominence in South Carolina state politics.\n\nAdmitted to the bar in 1837, Chesnut Jr. commenced practice that year in Camden. He was later elected as a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives (1840–52) and the South Carolina Senate (1852–58, serving as its president 1856–58). He was a delegate to the southern convention at Nashville, Tennessee, in 1850.\n\nIn 1858 Chesnut was elected by the South Carolina Legislature to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat to replace Josiah J. Evans. He served there for two years alongside Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina. Although a defender of slavery and states' rights, Chesnut opposed the re-opening of the African slave trade and was not as staunch a secessionist as most of the South Carolinian politicians. Moderate in his political views, he believed in extending protections for slavery's westward expansion while remaining within the Union.\n\nBut the political atmosphere tightened towards the Presidential Election of 1860, since the Republican Party and its presidential candidate, Abraham Lincoln, opposed slavery. After the results of the election were known, Chesnut decided that he could no longer stay in his office in the Senate. Shortly after Lincoln's election, he was the first Southern senator to withdraw from the Senate, on November 10, 1860. (He was expelled \"in absentia\" from the Senate the next year.)\n\nChesnut participated in the South Carolina secession convention in December 1860 and was subsequently elected to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. He was a member of the committee which drafted the Confederate States Constitution.\n\nIn the spring of 1861, he served as an aide-de-camp to General P.G.T. Beauregard and was sent by the general to demand the surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston. After the commander of the fort, Major Robert Anderson of the U.S. Army declined to surrender, Chesnut gave orders to the nearby Fort Johnson to open fire on Fort Sumter. In consequence the first shots of the Civil War were fired, on April 12, 1861. In the summer of 1861 Chesnut also took part in the First Battle of Manassas as an aide-de-camp to Beauregard.\n\nIn 1862 Chesnut served as a member of the South Carolina's Executive Council and the Chief of the Department of the Military of South Carolina. Later in the war he served the Confederate Army as a colonel and an aide to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. In 1864 he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of South Carolina reserve forces until the end of the war. He was third in command of the confederate forces at the Battle of Tulifinny. He was in overall command before the arrival of Maj. Gen. Samuel Jones and later Brig. Gen. Lucius Gartrell. After the war, he returned to the practice of law in Camden and formed the Conservative Party.\n\nAlthough James Chesnut Jr. was the only son, his father had given him little of his extensive property. Because his father lived to the age of 90 and gave his son but a small allowance, the son James had to live mainly on his law practice. The Chesnut fortune declined in the course of the war and thus, after his father died in 1866, Chesnut inherited little more than the extensive debts that encumbered the Mulberry and Sandy Hill plantations.\n\nChesnut married seventeen-year-old Mary Boykin Miller (1823–86), on April 23, 1840. She later became well known for her book on life during the Civil War, published as a diary but revised extensively from 1881 to 1886. The daughter of U.S. Senator Stephen Decatur Miller (1788–1838) and Mary Boykin (1804–85), she was well-educated and intelligent and took part in her husband's career. The Chesnuts' marriage was at times stormy due to difference in temperament (she was hot-tempered and passionate and came occasionally to regard her husband as cool and reserved). Their companionship was mostly warm and affectionate but they had no children. The couple resided at Chesnut Cottage in Columbia during the Civil War period.\n\nAs Mary Chesnut described in depth in her diary, the Chesnuts had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the society of the South and the Confederacy. Among their friends were, for example, Confederate general John Bell Hood, ex-Governor John L. Manning, Confederate general and politician John S. Preston and his wife Caroline, Confederate general and politician Wade Hampton III, Confederate politician Clement C. Clay and his wife Virginia, and Confederate general and politician Louis T. Wigfall and his wife Charlotte. The Chesnuts were intimate family friends of President Jefferson Davis and his wife Varina Howell. James Chesnut was also a first cousin of fellow Confederate general Zachariah C. Deas.\n\nJames Chesnut was \"regarded as an amiable, modest gentleman of decent parts [gifts]\", who performed his duties with ability and dignity both in political and military life. He died at home in Camden in 1885; interment was in Chesnut Family Cemetery, Kershaw County, South Carolina.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18622119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18622119", "title": "Leo Tolstoy", "text": "Leo Tolstoy\n\nCount Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy (; Russian: , tr. ; ; ), usually referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time.\n\nBorn to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels \"War and Peace\" (1869) and \"Anna Karenina\" (1877), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction. He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, \"Childhood\", \"Boyhood\", and \"Youth\" (1852–1856), and \"Sevastopol Sketches\" (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War. Tolstoy's fiction includes dozens of short stories and several novellas such as \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" (1886), \"Family Happiness\" (1859), and \"Hadji Murad\" (1912). He also wrote plays and numerous philosophical essays.\n\nIn the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work \"A Confession\" (1882). His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist. Tolstoy's ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as \"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (1894), were to have a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Tolstoy also became a dedicated advocate of Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he incorporated into his writing, particularly \"Resurrection\" (1899).\n\nThe Tolstoys were a well-known family of old Russian nobility who traced their ancestry to a mythical nobleman named Indris described by Pyotr Tolstoy as arriving \"from Nemec, from the lands of Caesar\" to Chernigov in 1353 along with his two sons Litvinos (or Litvonis) and Zimonten (or Zigmont) and a druzhina of 3000 people. While the word \"Nemec\" has been long used to describe Germans only, back in the days it was applied to any foreigner who didn't speak Russian (from the word \"nemoy\" meaning \"mute\"). Indris was then converted to Eastern Orthodoxy under the name of Leonty and his sons — as Konstantin and Feodor, respectively. Konstantin's grandson Andrei Kharitonovich was nicknamed Tolstiy (translated as \"fat\") by Vasily II of Moscow after he moved from Chernigov to Moscow.\n\nBecause of the pagan names and the fact that Chernigov at the time was ruled by Demetrius I Starshy some researches concluded that they were Lithuanians who arrived from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then part of the State of the Teutonic Order. At the same time, no mention of Indris was ever found in the 14th – 16th-century documents, while the Chernigov Chronicles used by Pyotr Tolstoy as a reference were lost. The first documented members of the Tolstoy family also lived during the 17th century, thus Pyotr Tolstoy himself is generally considered the founder of the noble house, being granted the title of count by Peter the Great.\n\nTolstoy was born at Yasnaya Polyana, a family estate 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) southwest of Tula, Russia, and 200 kilometers (120 mi) south of Moscow. He was the fourth of five children of Count Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy (1794–1837), a veteran of the Patriotic War of 1812, and Countess Mariya Tolstaya (née Volkonskaya; 1790–1830). After his parents died during his childhood, Tolstoy and his siblings were brought up by relatives. In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at Kazan University. His time there was not a success however, with teachers describing him as \"both unable and unwilling to learn.\" Tolstoy left the university in the middle of his studies, returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much of his time in Moscow, Tula and Saint Petersburg, leading a lax and leisurely lifestyle. He began writing during this period, including his first novel \"Childhood\", a fictitious account of his own youth, which was published in 1852. In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the Caucasus and joined the army. Tolstoy served as a young artillery officer during the Crimean War and was in Sevastopol during the 11-month-long siege of Sevastopol in 1854–55, including the Battle of the Chernaya. During the war he was recognised for his bravery and courage and promoted to lieutenant. He was appalled by the number of deaths involved in warfare, and left the army after the end of the Crimean War.\n\nHis conversion from a dissolute and privileged society author to the non-violent and spiritual anarchist of his latter days was brought about by his experience in the army as well as two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61. Others who followed the same path were Alexander Herzen, Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that would mark the rest of his life. Writing in a letter to his friend Vasily Botkin: \"The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed not only to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government anywhere.\" Tolstoy's concept of non-violence or Ahimsa was bolstered when he read a German version of the Tirukkural. He later instilled the concept in Mahatma Gandhi through his A Letter to a Hindu when young Gandhi corresponded with him seeking his advice.\n\nHis European trip in 1860–61 shaped both his political and literary development when he met Victor Hugo, whose literary talents Tolstoy praised after reading Hugo's newly finished \"Les Misérables\". The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Apart from reviewing Proudhon's forthcoming publication, \"La Guerre et la Paix\" (\"War and Peace\" in French), whose title Tolstoy would borrow for his masterpiece, the two men discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: \"If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time.\"\n\nFired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for the children of Russia's peasants, who had just been emancipated from serfdom in 1861. Tolstoy described the school's principles in his 1862 essay \"The School at Yasnaya Polyana\". Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived, partly due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. However, as a direct forerunner to A. S. Neill's Summerhill School, the school at Yasnaya Polyana can justifiably be claimed the first example of a coherent theory of democratic education.\n\nThe death of his brother Nikolay in 1860 had an impact on Tolstoy, and led him to a desire to marry. On September 23, 1862, Tolstoy married Sophia Andreevna Behrs, who was 16 years his junior and the daughter of a court physician. She was called Sonya, the Russian diminutive of Sofia, by her family and friends. They had 13 children, eight of whom survived childhood:\n\n\nThe marriage was marked from the outset by sexual passion and emotional insensitivity when Tolstoy, on the eve of their marriage, gave her his diaries detailing his extensive sexual past and the fact that one of the serfs on his estate had borne him a son. Even so, their early married life was happy and allowed Tolstoy much freedom and the support system to compose \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina\" with Sonya acting as his secretary, editor, and financial manager. Sonya was copying and handwriting his epic works time after time. Tolstoy would continue editing \"War and Peace\" and had to have clean final drafts to be delivered to the publisher.\n\nHowever, their later life together has been described by A. N. Wilson as one of the unhappiest in literary history. Tolstoy's relationship with his wife deteriorated as his beliefs became increasingly radical. This saw him seeking to reject his inherited and earned wealth, including the renunciation of the copyrights on his earlier works.\n\nSome of the members of the Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the 1905 Russian Revolution and the subsequent establishment of the Soviet Union, and many of Leo Tolstoy's relatives and descendants today live in Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Among them are Swedish jazz singer Viktoria Tolstoy and the Swedish landowner Christopher Paus, whose family owns the major estate Herresta outside Stockholm.\n\nOne of his great-great-grandsons, Vladimir Tolstoy (born 1962), is a director of the Yasnaya Polyana museum since 1994 and an adviser to the President of Russia on cultural affairs since 2012. Ilya Tolstoy's great-grandson, Pyotr Tolstoy, is a well-known Russian journalist and TV presenter as well as a State Duma deputy since 2016. His cousin Fyokla Tolstaya (born Anna Tolstaya in 1971), daughter of the acclaimed Soviet Slavist Nikita Tolstoy () (1923–1996), is also a Russian journalist, TV and radio host.\n\nTolstoy is considered one of the giants of Russian literature; his works include the novels \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina\" and novellas such as \"Hadji Murad\" and \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\".\n\nTolstoy's earliest works, the autobiographical novels \"Childhood\", \"Boyhood\", and \"Youth\" (1852–1856), tell of a rich landowner's son and his slow realization of the chasm between himself and his peasants. Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up.\n\nTolstoy served as a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment during the Crimean War, recounted in his \"Sevastopol Sketches\". His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent pacifism and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.\n\nHis fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived. \"The Cossacks\" (1863) describes the Cossack life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl. \"Anna Karenina\" (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in \"War and Peace\", Levin in \"Anna Karenina\" and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in \"Resurrection\".\n\"War and Peace\" is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of Napoleon, from the court of Alexander I of Russia to the battlefields of Austerlitz and Borodino. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the Decembrist revolt, to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that Andrei Bolkonsky's son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider \"War and Peace\" to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the realist school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life. \"War and Peace\" (which is to Tolstoy really an epic in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that \"Anna Karenina\" was his first true novel.\n\nAfter \"Anna Karenina\", Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" (1886) and \"What Is to Be Done?\" develop a radical anarcho-pacifist Christian philosophy which led to his excommunication from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1901. For all the praise showered on \"Anna Karenina\" and \"War and Peace\", Tolstoy rejected the two works later in his life as something not as true of reality.\n\nIn his novel \"Resurrection\", Tolstoy attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of Georgism, of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life.\n\nTolstoy also tried himself in poetry with several soldier songs written during his military service and fairy tales in verse such as \"Volga-bogatyr\" and \"Oaf\" stylized as national folk songs. They were written between 1871 and 1874 for his \"Russian Book for Reading\", a collection of short stories in four volumes (total of 629 stories in various genres) published along with the \"New Azbuka\" textbook and addressed to schoolchildren. Nevertheless, he was skeptical about poetry as a genre. As he famously said, \"Writing poetry is like ploughing and dancing at the same time\". According to Valentin Bulgakov, he criticised poets, including Alexander Pushkin, for their \"false\" epithets used \"simply to make it rhyme\".\n\nTolstoy's contemporaries paid him lofty tributes. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who died thirty years before Tolstoy's death, thought him the greatest of all living novelists. Gustave Flaubert, on reading a translation of \"War and Peace\", exclaimed, \"What an artist and what a psychologist!\" Anton Chekhov, who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, \"When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature.\" The 19th-century British poet and critic Matthew Arnold opined that \"A novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life.\"\n\nLater novelists continued to appreciate Tolstoy's art, but sometimes also expressed criticism. Arthur Conan Doyle wrote \"I am attracted by his earnestness and by his power of detail, but I am repelled by his looseness of construction and by his unreasonable and impracticable mysticism.\" Virginia Woolf declared him \"the greatest of all novelists.\" James Joyce noted that \"He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!\" Thomas Mann wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: \"Seldom did art work so much like nature.\" Vladimir Nabokov heaped superlatives upon \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" and \"Anna Karenina\"; he questioned, however, the reputation of \"War and Peace\", and sharply criticized \"Resurrection\" and \"The Kreutzer Sonata\".\n\nAfter reading Schopenhauer's \"The World as Will and Representation\", Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: \"Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer\"\n\nIn Chapter VI of \"A Confession\", Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explained how the nothingness that results from complete denial of self is only a relative nothingness, and is not to be feared. The novelist was struck by the description of Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for eternal salvation is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior (): \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Therefore, those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose voluntary poverty when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus Buddha Sakyamuni was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's staff; and Francis of Assisi, the founder of the mendicant orders who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: \"Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?\" and who replied: \"I have made a far more beautiful choice!\" \"Whom?\" \"\"La povertà\" (poverty)\": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.\n\nIn 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called \"What I Believe\", in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in Jesus Christ's teachings and was particularly influenced by the Sermon on the Mount, and the injunction to turn the other cheek, which he understood as a \"commandment of non-resistance to evil by force\" and a doctrine of pacifism and nonviolence. In his work \"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\", he explains that he considered mistaken the Church's doctrine because they had made a \"perversion\" of Christ's teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American Quakers who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as George Fox, William Penn and Jonathan Dymond. Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the consequences of being a pacifist, and the apparently inevitable waging of war by government, are the reason why he is considered a philosophical anarchist.\n\nLater, various versions of \"Tolstoy's Bible\" would be published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.\n\nTolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner self-perfection through following the Great Commandment of loving one's neighbor and God rather than looking outward to the Church or state for guidance. His belief in nonresistance when faced by conflict is another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ's teachings. By directly influencing Mahatma Gandhi with this idea through his work \"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (full text of English translation ), Tolstoy's profound influence on the nonviolent resistance movement reverberates to this day. He believed that the aristocracy were a burden on the poor, and that the only solution to how we live together is through anarchism.\n\nHe also opposed private property in land ownership and the institution of marriage and valued the ideals of chastity and sexual abstinence (discussed in \"Father Sergius\" and his preface to \"The Kreutzer Sonata\"), ideals also held by the young Gandhi. Tolstoy's later work derives a passion and verve from the depth of his austere moral views. The sequence of the temptation of Sergius in \"Father Sergius\", for example, is among his later triumphs. Gorky relates how Tolstoy once read this passage before himself and Chekhov and that Tolstoy was moved to tears by the end of the reading. Other later passages of rare power include the personal crises that were faced by the protagonists of \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", and of \"Master and Man\", where the main character in the former or the reader in the latter are made aware of the foolishness of the protagonists' lives.\n\nTolstoy had a profound influence on the development of Christian anarchist thought. The Tolstoyans were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy's companion, Vladimir Chertkov (1854–1936), to spread Tolstoy's religious teachings. Philosopher Peter Kropotkin wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the \"1911 Encyclopædia Britannica\":Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, Chojecki, Denk and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the state and property rights, deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason.\n\nWith all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in \"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\") a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present property laws. He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.\n\nDuring the Boxer Rebellion in China, Tolstoy praised the Boxers. He was harshly critical of the atrocities committed by the Russians, Germans, Americans, Japanese, and other western troops. He accused them of engaging in slaughter when he heard about the lootings, rapes, and murders, in what he saw as Christian brutality. Tolstoy also named the two monarchs most responsible for the atrocities; Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm II of Germany. Tolstoy, a famous sinophile, also read the works of Chinese thinker and philosopher, Confucius. Tolstoy corresponded with the Chinese intellectual Gu Hongming and recommended that China remain an agrarian nation and warned against reform like what Japan implemented.\n\nThe Eight-Nation Alliance intervention in the Boxer Rebellion was denounced by Tolstoy as were the Philippine–American War and the Second Boer War between the British Empire and the two independent Boer republics. The words \"terrible for its injustice and cruelty\" were used to describe the Czarist intervention in China by Tolstoy. Confucius's works were studied by Tolstoy. The attack on China in the Boxer Rebellion was railed against by Tolstoy. The war against China was criticized by Leonid Andreev and Gorkey. \"To the Chinese people\", an epistle, was written by Tolstoy as part of the criticism of the war by intellectuals in Russia. The activities of Russia in China by Nicholas II were described in an open letter where they were slammed and denounced by Leo Tolstoy in 1902. Tolstoy corresponded with Gu Hongming and they both opposed the Hundred Day's Reform by Kang Youwei and agreed that the reform movement was perilous. Tolstoys' ideology on non violence shaped the anarchist thought of the Society for the Study of Socialism in China. Lao Zi and Confucius's teachings were studied by Tolstoy. \"Chinese Wisdom\" was a text written by Tolstoy. The Boxer Rebellion stirred Tolstoy's interest in Chinese philosophy. The Boxer and Boxer wars were denounced by Tolstoy.\n\nIn hundreds of essays over the last 20 years of his life, Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by Kropotkin and Proudhon to his readers, whilst rejecting anarchism's espousal of violent revolutionary means. In the 1900 essay, \"On Anarchy\", he wrote; \"The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution—a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.\" Despite his misgivings about anarchist violence, Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of anarchist thinkers in Russia, and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's \"Words of a Rebel\", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.\n\nTolstoy was enthused by the economic thinking of Henry George, incorporating it approvingly into later works such as \"Resurrection\" (1899), the book that played a major factor in his excommunication.\n\nIn 1908, Tolstoy wrote \"A Letter to a Hindu\" outlining his belief in non-violence as a means for India to gain independence from British colonial rule. In 1909, a copy of the letter was read by Gandhi, who was working as a lawyer in South Africa at the time and just becoming an activist. Tolstoy's letter was significant for Gandhi, who wrote Tolstoy seeking proof that he was the real author, leading to further correspondence between them.\n\nReading Tolstoy's \"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" also convinced Gandhi to avoid violence and espouse nonviolent resistance, a debt Gandhi acknowledged in his autobiography, calling Tolstoy \"the greatest apostle of non-violence that the present age has produced\". The correspondence between Tolstoy and Gandhi would only last a year, from October 1909 until Tolstoy's death in November 1910, but led Gandhi to give the name Tolstoy Colony to his second ashram in South Africa. Besides nonviolent resistance, the two men shared a common belief in the merits of vegetarianism, the subject of several of Tolstoy's essays.\n\nTolstoy also became a major supporter of the Esperanto movement. Tolstoy was impressed by the pacifist beliefs of the Doukhobors and brought their persecution to the attention of the international community, after they burned their weapons in peaceful protest in 1895. He aided the Doukhobors in migrating to Canada. In 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, Tolstoy condemned the war and wrote to the Japanese Buddhist priest Soyen Shaku in a failed attempt to make a joint pacifist statement.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Tolstoy become more and more occupied with the economic theory and social philosophy of Georgism. He spoke of great admiration of Henry George, stating once that \"People do not argue with the teaching of George; they simply do not know it. And it is impossible to do otherwise with his teaching, for he who becomes acquainted with it cannot but agree.\" He also wrote a preface to George's \"Social Problems\". Tolstoy and George both rejected private property in land (the most important source of income of the passive Russian aristocracy that Tolstoy so heavily criticized) whilst simultaneously both rejecting a centrally planned socialist economy. Some assume that this development in Tolstoy's thinking was a move away from his anarchist views, since Georgism requires a central administration to collect land rent and spend it on infrastructure. However, anarchist versions of Georgism have also been proposed since. Tolstoy's 1899 novel \"Resurrection\" explores his thoughts on Georgism in more detail and hints that Tolstoy indeed had such a view. It suggests the possibility of small communities with some form of local governance to manage the collective land rents for common goods; whilst still heavily criticising institutions of the state such as the justice system.\n\nTolstoy died in 1910, at the age of 82. Just prior to his death, his health had been a concern of his family, who were actively engaged in his care on a daily basis. During his last few days, he had spoken and written about dying. Renouncing his aristocratic lifestyle, he had finally gathered the nerve to separate from his wife, and left home in the middle of winter, in the dead of night. His secretive departure was an apparent attempt to escape unannounced from Sophia's jealous tirades. She was outspokenly opposed to many of his teachings, and in recent years had grown envious of the attention which it seemed to her Tolstoy lavished upon his Tolstoyan \"disciples\".\n\nTolstoy died of pneumonia at Astapovo train station, after a day's rail journey south. The station master took Tolstoy to his apartment, and his personal doctors were called to the scene. He was given injections of morphine and camphor.\n\nThe police tried to limit access to his funeral procession, but thousands of peasants lined the streets. Still, some were heard to say that, other than knowing that \"some nobleman had died\", they knew little else about Tolstoy.\n\nAccording to some sources, Tolstoy spent the last hours of his life preaching love, nonviolence, and Georgism to his fellow passengers on the train.\n\nA 2009 film about Tolstoy's final year, \"The Last Station\", based on the novel by Jay Parini, was made by director Michael Hoffman with Christopher Plummer as Tolstoy and Helen Mirren as Sofya Tolstoya. Both performers were nominated for Oscars for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including \"Departure of a Grand Old Man\", made in 1912 just two years after his death, \"How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were\" (1913), and \"Leo Tolstoy\", directed by and starring Sergei Gerasimov in 1984.\n\nThere is also a famous lost film of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer Burton Holmes visited Yasnaya Polyana with Albert J. Beveridge, the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge's advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that documentary evidence of a meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge's chances of running for the U.S. presidency.\n\n\n"}

In common with his many brothers and sisters, his father gave him an unconventional name.\n\nHis surname at birth was \"Tollemache-Tollemache\", his father having doubled his original surname, \"Tollemache\", in 1876 after his second marriage. \"de Orellana\" derives from the naming customs of Spain, where his mother came from, and is a forename rather than part of his surname. The first \"Tollemache-Tollemache\" also seems to be an unusual forename. Leone was Ralph's sixth son, hence \"Sextus\". \"Fraudatifilius\" is Latin for \"son of the defrauded one\". \"Leone\" repeats a pattern seen in the names of his elder brothers and sisters (Lyonel, Lyonesse, Lyulph, Lyona, Leo, Lyonella and Lyonetta). His first five initials, \"LSD OF\", may include a reference to the divisions of the pre-decimal British currency, £sd, for pounds, shillings, and pence followed by half-pence (\"ob.\", \"obol\") and farthings (\"i.e.\", quarter-pence). This may be a reference to a financial dispute between his father Ralph and Ralph's first wife's trustees which had driven him bankrupt in 1863. Similarly, an elder brother was named Lyulph Ydwallo Odin Nestor Egbert Lyonel Toedmag Hugh Erchenwyne Saxon Esa Cromwell Orma Nevill Dysart Plantagenet Tollemache-Tollemache—his first 15 initials spell \"LYONEL THE SECOND\". In practice, Leone shortened his name to \"Leone Sextus Tollemache\".\n\nHe joined the British Army, attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1902. He was commissioned into the Leicestershire Regiment in 1903. Before the First World War, he served in British India and at Fermoy in Ireland.\n\nHe married an Irishwoman, Kathleen Mary Mills (daughter of Joseph Mills and Charlotte née Bloomfield), at Acomb, North Yorkshire on 23 April 1914. They honeymooned in Fermoy. Their son was born on 12 January 1915 in White House in Acomb; Kathleen died in childbirth, but the son, Denys Herbert George, survived.\n\nOn the outbreak of the First World War, he was sent to France on the Union-Castle steamer SS \"Braemar Castle\" in September 1914. He kept a personal diary of his experiences. In 1916, Leone was seconded to serve as brigade major in the 3rd Australian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Australian Division after it was redeployed from Gallipoli to the Somme. He died on active service in 1917, from influenza. He is buried in the communal war cemetery in Dernancourt near Albert.\n\nLeone's elder brother Leo (Quintus Tollemache-Tollemache de Orellana Plantagenet) also served in France, in the 1st Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment. He went missing, presumed killed, on 1 November 1914 and his body was never found. He is commemorated on the Menin Gate memorial.\n"}

{"id": "2023654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2023654", "title": "Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon", "text": "Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon\n\nLucy Christiana, Lady Duff-Gordon (née Sutherland; 13 June 1863 – 20 April 1935) was a leading British fashion designer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who worked under the professional name Lucile.\n\nThe first British-based designer to achieve international acclaim, Lucy Duff-Gordon was a widely acknowledged innovator in couture styles as well as in fashion industry public relations. In addition to originating the \"mannequin parade\", a precursor to the modern fashion show, and training the first professional models, she launched liberating slit skirts and low necklines, popularized less restrictive corsets, and promoted alluring and pared-down lingerie.\n\nOpening branches of her London house, Lucile Ltd, in Chicago, New York City, and Paris, her business became the first global couture brand, dressing a trend-setting clientele of royalty, nobility, and stage and film personalities. Duff-Gordon is also remembered as a survivor of the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\" in 1912, and as the losing party in the precedent-setting 1917 contract law case of \"Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon\", in which Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo wrote the opinion for New York's highest court, the New York Court of Appeals, upholding a contract between Duff-Gordon and her advertising agent that assigned the agent the sole right to market her name.\n\nThe daughter of civil engineer Douglas Sutherland (1838–1865) and his Anglo-French-Canadian wife Elinor Saunders (1841–1937), Lucy Christiana Sutherland was born in London, England, and raised in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, after her father's death from typhoid fever. When her mother remarried in 1871 to the bachelor David Kennedy (d. 1889), Lucy moved with them and her sister, the future novelist Elinor Glyn, to Saint Helier on the Isle of Jersey. Lucy acquired her love of fashion through dressing her collection of dolls, by studying gowns worn by women in family paintings, and by later making clothes for herself and Elinor. Returning to Jersey, after a visit to relatives in England in 1875, Lucy and Elinor survived the wreck of their ship when it ran aground in a gale.\n\nIn 1884, Lucy married for the first time, to James Stuart Wallace, with whom she had a child, Esme (1885–1973; later wife of the 2nd Earl of Halsbury and mother of Anthony, 3rd Earl of Halsbury). Wallace was an alcoholic and regularly unfaithful, and Lucy sought consolation in love affairs, including a long relationship with the famous surgeon Sir Morell Mackenzie. The Wallaces separated circa 1890, and Lucy started divorce proceedings in 1893. In 1900, Lucy Sutherland Wallace married a Scottish baronet, landowner and sportsman Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon.\n\nIn order to support herself and her daughter after the end of her first marriage, Lucy Duff-Gordon began working as a dressmaker from home. In 1893, she opened Maison Lucile at 24 Old Burlington St., in the heart of the fashionable West End of London, having worked for a year previously from her mother's flat at 25 Davies Street. In 1897, Lucy Duff-Gordon opened a larger shop at 17 Hanover Square, Westminster, before a further move (c. 1903–04) to 14 George Street, Oxford. In 1903, the business was incorporated as \"Lucile Ltd\" and the following year moved to 23 Hanover Square, where it operated for the next 20 years. Duff Gordon was eventually bankrupted after she revealed in the American press that she was not designing much of the clothing that was attributed to her name. She spent her later years selling imported clothing and smaller collections in a succession of unsuccessful small 'boutiques'.\n\nLucile Ltd served a wealthy clientele including aristocracy, royalty, and theatre stars. The business expanded, with salons opening in New York City in 1910, Paris in 1911, and Chicago in 1915, making it the first leading couture house with full-scale branches in three countries.\n\nLucile was most famous for its lingerie, tea gowns, and evening wear. Its luxuriously layered and draped garments in soft fabrics of blended pastel colors, often accentuated with sprays of hand-made silk flowers, became its hallmark. However, Lucile also offered simple, smart tailored suits and daywear. The dress illustrated at right typifies the classically draped style often found in Lucile designs. Lucy Duff-Gordon originally designed it in Paris, for Lucile Ltd's spring 1913 collection, and later specially adapted it for London socialite Heather Firbank and other well-known clients, including actress Kitty Gordon and dancer Lydia Kyasht of the Ballets Russes. The example illustrated was worn by Miss Firbank and is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nLucy Duff-Gordon is also widely credited with training the first professional fashion models (called \"mannequins\") as well as staging the first runway or \"catwalk\" style shows. These affairs were theatrically inspired, invitation-only, tea-time presentations, complete with a stage, curtains, mood-setting lighting, music from a string band, souvenir gifts, and programmes.\n\nAnother innovation in the presentation of her collections was what she called her \"emotional gowns\". These dresses were given descriptive names, influenced by literature, history, popular culture and her interest in the psychology and personality of her clients.\n\nSome well-known clients, whose clothing influenced many when it appeared in early films, on stage, and in the press, included: Irene Castle, Lily Elsie, Gertie Millar, Gaby Deslys, Billie Burke, and Mary Pickford. Lucile costumed numerous theatrical productions, including the London première of Franz Lehár's operetta \"The Merry Widow\" (1907), the \"Ziegfeld Follies\" revues on Broadway (1915–21), and the D. W. Griffith silent movie \"Way Down East\" (1920). Lucile creations were also frequently featured in Pathé and Gaumont newsreels of the 1910s and 20s, and Lucy Duff-Gordon appeared in her own weekly spot in the British newsreel \"Around the Town\" (c. 1919–21).\n\nEarly Lucile Ltd sketches, archived at the Victoria and Albert Museum, provide evidence that in 1904 the salon employed at least one sketch artist to record Lucy Duff-Gordon's designs for in-house use. As demands grew on her time, especially in the United States during World War I, she was aided by sketch artists Robert Kalloch, Roger Bealle, Gilbert Clarke, Howard Greer, Shirley Barker, Travis Banton, and Edward Molyneux, who created ideas based on the \"Lucile look\". In her memoir, Lucy Duff-Gordon credited her corps of assistants for their contributions to the success of the New York branch of Lucile Ltd. Many of these assistants' drawings were published in the press and signed \"Lucile\", though occasionally the signature of the artist, such as Molyneux, appeared. It was general practice for couture houses to use professional artists to execute drawings of designs as they were being created, as well as of the artist's own ideas for each season's output and for individual clients. These drawings were overseen by Lucy Duff-Gordon, who often critiqued them, adding notes, instructions, dates, and sometimes her own signature or initials, indicating she approved the design.\n\nLike many couturiers, Lucy Duff-Gordon designed principally on the human form. Her surviving personal sketchbooks indicate her limited technical ability as a sketch artist, but a skill at recording colour. Surviving Lucile Ltd sketches reveal numerous artists of varying talent levels, and these are often mis-attributed to herself. Howard Greer admitted in his autobiography that the sketches he and his colleagues executed were often confused interpretations of the Lucile style that did not match their employer's vision. Moreover, he claimed customers were not always pleased by the actual dresses created from the sketches he and the other assistants submitted.\n\nUnprecedented for a leading couturière, Lucy Duff-Gordon promoted her collections journalistically. In addition to a weekly syndicated fashion page for the Hearst newspaper syndicate (1910–22), she wrote monthly columns for \"Harper's Bazaar\" and \"Good Housekeeping\" (1912–22). A Hearst writer ghost wrote the newspaper page after 1918, but the designer herself penned the \"Good Housekeeping\" and \"Harper's Bazaar\" features throughout their duration, although the responsibility of producing a regular piece proved difficult, and she missed several deadlines. Lucile fashions also appeared regularly in \"Vogue\", \"Femina\", \"Les Modes\", \"L'art et la Mode\", and other leading fashion magazines (1910–22). Along with Hearst publications, Lucile contributed to \"Vanity Fair\", \"Dress\", \"The Illustrated London News\", \"The London Magazine\", \"Pearson's Magazine\", and \"Munsey's\".\n\nIn addition to her career as a couturière, costumier, journalist, and pundit, Lucy Duff-Gordon took significant advantage of opportunities for commercial endorsement, lending her name to advertising for brassieres, perfume, shoes, and other luxury apparel and beauty items. Among the most adventurous of her licensing ventures were a two-season, lower-priced, mail-order fashion line for Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1916–17), which promoted her clothing in special de luxe catalogues, and a contract to design interiors for limousines and town cars for the Chalmers Motor Co., later Chrysler Corporation (1917).\n\nIn 1912, Lucy Duff-Gordon traveled to America on business in connection with the New York branch of Lucile Ltd. She and her husband, Sir Cosmo, booked first class passage on the ocean liner under the alias \"Mr. and Mrs. Morgan\", a possible explanation being that they hoped to avoid publicity on landing in New York. Her secretary, Laura Mabel Francatelli, nicknamed \"Franks\", accompanied the couple.\n\nOn 14 April, at 11:40 pm the \"Titanic\" struck an iceberg and began to sink. During the evacuation, the Duff-Gordons and Francatelli escaped in Lifeboat No. 1. Although the boat was designed to hold 40 people, it was lowered with only 12 people aboard, seven of them male crew members.\n\nSome time after the \"Titanic\" sank, while afloat in Lifeboat No. 1, Lucy Duff-Gordon reportedly commented to her secretary, \"There is your beautiful nightdress gone.\" A fireman, annoyed by her comment, replied that while the couple could replace their property, he and the other crew members had lost everything in the sinking. Sir Cosmo then offered each of the men £5 (equivalent to £ in ) to aid them until they received new assignments. While on the RMS \"Carpathia\", the Cunard liner that rescued \"Titanic\"'s survivors, Sir Cosmo presented the men from Lifeboat No. 1 with checks drawn on his bank, Coutts. This action later spawned gossip that the Duff-Gordons had bribed their lifeboat's crew not to return to save swimmers out of fear the vessel would be swamped.\n\nThese rumors were fueled by the tabloid press in the United States and, eventually, in the United Kingdom. On May 17, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon testified at the London hearings of the British Board of Trade inquiry into the disaster. On May 20, Lady Duff-Gordon took the stand. The couple's testimony attracted the largest crowds during the inquiry.\n\nWhile Sir Cosmo faced tough criticism during cross-examination, his wife had it slightly easier. Dressed in black, with a large, veiled hat, she told the court she remembered little about what happened in the lifeboat on the night of the sinking, due to seasickness, and she could not recall specific conversations. Lawyers did not seem to have pressed her very hard. Lucy Duff-Gordon noted that for the rest of her husband's life he was brokenhearted over the negative coverage by the \"yellow press\", during his cross-examination at the inquiry. The final report by the inquiry determined that the Duff-Gordons did not deter the crew from any attempt at rescue through bribery or any other method of coercion.\n\nIn 2012 a box of documents and letters concerning the Titanic sinking belonging to the Duff-Gordons was rediscovered at the London office of Veale Wasbrough Vizards, the legal firm that merged with Tweedies, which had represented the couple. Among the papers was an inventory of the possessions Lucy Duff Gordon had lost, the total value listed as £3,208 3s 6d. One letter detailed what she wore when leaving the ship: two dressing gowns \"for warmth\", a muff, and her \"motor hat\". (A faded grey silk kimono with typical Fortuny-style black cord edging, for some time thought to have been worn by her that night, is now understood to have belonged to her daughter Esme, Countess of Halsbury, as its distinctive print dates the item to post World War I.) An apron said to have been worn by Francatelli can be seen at the Maritime Museum in Liverpool, and her life-jacket was sold, along with correspondence about her experiences in the disaster, at Christie's auction house, London, in 2007.\n\nThe \"Titanic\" episode is one of the most prominent aspects of Lucy Duff-Gordon's life, thanks partly to motion pictures. The films, however, portrayed her without great attention to accuracy. She has been portrayed by Harriette Johns in \"A Night to Remember\" (1958); by Rosalind Ayres in James Cameron's epic \"Titanic\" (1997); and by Sylvestra Le Touzel in the British miniseries \"Titanic\" (2012).\n\nLucy Duff-Gordon had another close call three years after surviving the \"Titanic\", when she booked passage aboard the final voyage of the RMS \"Lusitania\". It was reported in the press that she cancelled her trip due to illness. The \"Lusitania\" was sunk by a German torpedo on 7 May 1915.\n\nIn 1917, Lucy Duff-Gordon lost the New York Court of Appeals case of \"Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon\", in which Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo established precedent in the realm of contract law when he held the designer to a contract that assigned the sole right to market her professional name to her advertising agent, Otis F. Wood, despite the fact that the contract lacked explicit consideration for her promise. Cardozo noted that, \"A promise may be lacking, and yet the whole writing may be 'instinct with an obligation'\" and, if so, \"there is a contract.\" 222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214 (1917).\n\nCardozo famously opened the opinion with the following description of the designer:\n\nAlthough the term \"creator of fashions\" was part of the tagline in 'Lucile's' columns for the Hearst papers, some observers have claimed that Cardozo's tone revealed a certain disdain for her position in the world of fashion. Others accept that he was merely echoing language used by the defendant in her own submissions to the court as well as in her publicity.\n\nLucy Duff-Gordon's connection to her design empire began to disintegrate following a restructuring of Lucile, Ltd in 1918–19. An acrimonious battle emerged in the press, culminating in her public acknowledgement that many Lucile dresses were not designed by her. Lucy Duff-Gordon's autobiography acknowledges that this had been the case since at least 1911.\n\nBy September 1922, she had ceased designing for the company, which effectively closed. A completely new 'Lucile' was formed, using the same premises in Paris, and different designs, but it gradually failed. Meanwhile, its founder (who continued to be known as 'Lucile') worked from private premises designing personally for individual clients. She was briefly associated with the firm of Reville, Ltd., maintained a ready-to-wear shop of her own and lent her name to a wholesale operation in America.\n\nLucy Duff-Gordon also continued as a fashion columnist and critic after her design career ended, contributing to London's \"Daily Sketch\" and \"Daily Express\" (1922–1930), and she penned her best-selling autobiography \"Discretions and Indiscretions\" (1932).\n\nLady Duff-Gordon died of breast cancer, complicated by pneumonia, in a Putney, London nursing home in 1935, aged 71. The date of her death, 20 April, was the fourth anniversary of her husband's death.\n\nIn addition to her mark on culture, history, and the law, there has been a resurgence of interest in her work as a designer. She originated the fashion component of her sister Elinor Glyn's 'It girl' concept.\n\n\nA number of international museum exhibitions have featured Lucile garments in recent years, such as:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "914262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=914262", "title": "Metrocles", "text": "Metrocles\n\nMetrocles (; fl. c. 325 BC) was a Cynic philosopher from Maroneia. He studied in Aristotle’s Lyceum under Theophrastus, and eventually became a follower of Crates of Thebes who married Metrocles’ sister Hipparchia. Very little survives of his writings, but he is important as one of the first Cynics to adopt the practice of writing moral anecdotes (\"chreiai\") about Diogenes and other Cynics.\n\nThe supposed story of Metrocles' conversion to Cynicism is reported by Diogenes Laërtius. Metrocles had apparently farted while practicing a speech, and became so upset that he shut himself up in his home, attempting to commit suicide by starving himself. Crates visited him and made him a dinner of lupines, explaining to him that what he had done was according to nature and therefore nothing to be ashamed of. When Crates himself farted to demonstrate how natural it was, Metrocles was persuaded to let go of his shame.\n\nWhether or not this story is true, the symbolism for the Cynics is that it demonstrated the worthlessness of Metrocles' education up until that time. As a pupil of Theophrastus he may have learned a lot of information, but he was still obsessed with social conventions and good manners, to the point of being ready to die from embarrassment. With Crates' help he was able to let go of his old ways and embrace a Cynic life free from convention, and find true happiness.\n\nEqually significant is a passage preserved in the writings of Teles, who tells how Metrocles as a young student of the Lyceum and the Academy could not keep up with the extravagant life-style requirements:\nWhen he was studying with Theophrastus and Xenocrates, although many things were being sent to him from home, he was in constant fear of dying from hunger and was always destitute and in want. But when he later changed over to Crates, he could feed even another person though nothing was sent from home. For in the former case he had to have shoes... then a cloak, a following of slaves, and a grand house; for the common table he had to see that the breads were pure, the delicacies above the ordinary, the wine sweet, the entertainment appropriate, so that here there was much expense. For among them such a way of life was judged to be 'liberal.'\n\nAccording to Hecato of Rhodes, Metrocles burned all his writings, but others said it was only the notes he took in the school of Theophrastus that he burned. It may have been via Metrocles that his sister Hipparchia met Crates, whom she later married, thus also becoming a Cynic. Plutarch represents Metrocles as sleeping in the winter amongst sheep, and in the summer in the porches of temples. He apparently knew the Megarian philosopher Stilpo and disputed with him, and Stilpo wrote a dialogue called \"Metrocles\". In his biography of Metrocles, Diogenes Laërtius seemingly lists a number of his pupils, but the list probably refers to Crates. Metrocles died at a great age, and is said to have deliberately suffocated himself.\n\nMetrocles was a man of great ability, and wrote several works, but little of his thought survives. He objected to wealth unless it was put to good use; and he divided things into those that can be bought with money (such as a house), and those that take time and care, like education. One of his works was called \"Chreiai\" (), that is, \"Anecdotes\", or \"Maxims\". Thus he became one of the first to contribute to the most important literary art-form for the Cynics: thousands of anecdotes were accumulated (and invented) concerning Diogenes, Crates and other Cynics, all of them providing moral messages through the actions of the Cynics. An anecdote written by Metrocles concerning Diogenes is preserved by Laërtius:\nOn one occasion Diogenes went with his head half-shaved into an entertainment of young men, as Metrocles tells us in his \"Chreiai\", and so was beaten by them. And afterwards he wrote the names of all those who had beaten him, on a white tablet, and went about with the tablet round his neck, so as to expose them to insult, as they were generally condemned and reproached for their conduct.\n\n"}

He directed the Friends of the Manifesto and Liberty Party's (in French: \"Amis du Manifeste et de la Liberté\", AML) Federation in Constantine, and was a member of the Central Committee and Deputy of the Constantine region from 1947 to 1951. \n\nIn 1954, Omar Derdour became a political worker within the National Liberation Front (FLN) and undertook a great deal of propaganda and mobilization in France in 1955 and 1956 and then in Cairo, Egypt and throughout the Arab world. After independence, Omar Derdour devoted himself to teaching, became a founding member of the Islamic Institute, and founded numerous other Muslim institutions and schools.\n\nDerdour was born on 13 October 1913 in Hidoussa, a small village in the municipality of Teniet El Abed, in the heart of the Aurès Mountains. He was born into a family of scholars which hailed from the Ouled Abdi Valley in that mountain region.

In 1937, Derdour returned to his village to establish a madrasa for the education of children and adults. Ben Badis considered him the \"soul of the Islahiste movement in the Aures\". At the end of 1937, the French authorities became aware of his activities and imprisoned him in Batna for \"inciting the population to civil disobedience\". Derdour was released on 6 January 1938, but was imprisoned a second time in August 1939 to complete his four-month sentence and was fined 8,000 francs. He was released in September 1939 upon the outbreak of World War II (1939-1945). During the war the authorities suppressed all political activities, and he was forced to limit himself to non-political education.\n\nOmar Derdour directed the AML Party's Federation in Constantine, and was a member of the Central Committee and Deputy of the Constantine region from 1947 until 1951. The purpose of the AML party was to publicize and defend the Manifest du Peuple Algerien; anti-French, it demanded equal rights for the Muslim population and an autonomous Algeria federated with France, the colonial power. Between July 1955 and January 1956 he lived in Vichy, France, working with the National Liberation Front (FLN) on defining the objectives and approach of the revolution. Derdour moved to Cairo, meeting Sheikh Mohammed Bashir Brahimi and other members of the Revolutionary Command. He was given the task of travelling to the Arab countries to raise support for the Algerian revolution. Derdour was based in Cairo until he moved to Tunisia in 1960. He taught soldiers on the Algerian border until independence was achieved in 1962.\n\nAfter Algeria gained independence, Omar Derdour devoted himself to teaching Islam and Arabic. He founded the first Islamic institute in Batna in May 1963, followed by the creation of similar institutions in several cities across the country, reaching 10,000 students. \nIn 1981, Derdour was appointed director of the institute in Sidi Okba for training imams and regional inspectors of religious affairs in Batna, Khenchela and Oum El Bouaghi, holding this position until his retirement. In 1986, Derdour was appointed regional inspector of Religious Affairs in Batna and Khenchela provinces. In the 2000s he built a mosque and a zawiya in the locality of El Hamza in the municipality of Oued Taga and a school in the village of his birth. \n\nOn 19 March 2009 Abou El Kacem Omar Derdour died after a long battle against the effects of a stroke. He was buried in Tazoult.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "215289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215289", "title": "P. D. Ouspensky", "text": "P. D. Ouspensky\n\nPyotr Demianovich Ouspenskii (known in English as Peter D. Ouspensky, ; 5 March 1878 – 2 October 1947), was a Russian esotericist known for his expositions of the early work of the Greek-Armenian teacher of esoteric doctrine George Gurdjieff, whom he met in Moscow in 1915. Ouspensky was associated with the ideas and practices originating with Gurdjieff from then on. He shared the (Gurdjieff) \"system\" for 25 years in England and the United States, having separated from Gurdjieff in 1924 personally, for reasons he explains in the last chapter of his book \"In Search of the Miraculous\".\n\nAll in all, Ouspensky studied the Gurdjieff system directly under Gurdjieff's own supervision for a period of ten years, from 1915 to 1924. His book \"In Search of the Miraculous\" recounts what he learned from Gurdjieff during those years. While lecturing in London in 1924, he announced that he would continue independently the way he had begun in 1921. Some, including his close pupil Rodney Collin, say that he finally gave up the system in 1947, just before his death, but his own recorded words on the subject (\"A Record of Meetings\", published posthumously) do not clearly endorse this judgement, nor does Ouspensky's emphasis on \"you must make a new beginning\" after confessing \"I've left the system\".\n\nOuspensky was born in Moscow in 1878. In 1890, he was studying at the Second Moscow Gymnasium, a government school attended by boys from 10 to 18. At the age of 16, he was expelled from school for painting graffiti on the wall in plain sight of a visiting inspector; thereafter, he would be more or less on his own. In 1906, he was working in the editorial office of the Moscow daily paper \"The Morning\". In 1907 he discovered Theosophy. In the autumn of 1913, age 35, before the beginning of World War I, he journeyed to the East in search of the miraculous, visited Theosophists in Adyar but was forced to return to Moscow after the beginning of the Great War. There he met George Gurdjieff and married Sophie Grigorievna Maximenko. He had a mistress by the name of Anna Ilinishna Butkovsky.\n\nHis first book, \"The Fourth Dimension\", appeared in 1909; his second book, \"Tertium Organum\", in 1912. \"A New Model of the Universe\", as explained by Ouspensky in the foreword of the second edition, was written and published as articles by 1914, updated to include \"recent developments in physics\" and republished as a book in Russian in 1917. The work, as reflected in its title, shows the influence of Francis Bacon and Max Müller and has been interpreted as an attempt to reconcile ideas from natural science and the burgeoning field of religious studies with occultism in the tradition of Gurdjieff and Theosophy. It was assumed that that book was lost to the Revolution's violence, but it was then republished in English (without his knowledge) in 1931. Since the earliest lectures this work attracted a who's who of philosophy (see below) and has been to this day a widely accepted authoritative basis for a study of metaphysics, or rather, to exceed the limits of the same by his \"psychological method\", which he defines as (paraphrasing p. 75.) \"a calibration of the tools of human understanding to derive the actual meaning of the thing itself.\"\n\nThis term is one of three high concepts of the material presented, along with \"the esoteric method\" which as he sums up (p. 76) depends on the first to derive the possibility of something beyond ordinary human effort entirely. In high concept terms: \"The idea of esotericism ... holds that the very great majority of our ideas are not the product of evolution but the product of the degeneration of ideas which existed at some time or are still existing somewhere in much higher, purer and more complete forms.\" (p. 47) Ouspensky's reputation is presently degenerated to being a follower of Gurdjieff rather than a partner (see below) and the apex of esotericism, self-knowledge, and metaphysical thought. The title itself promises a model of the universe, or unified theory of everything, which it is. He also wrote the novel \"Strange Life of Ivan Osokin\", which explored the concept of eternal recurrence or the eternal return.\n\nHe traveled in Europe and the East — India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Egypt — in his search for knowledge. After his return to Russia and his introduction to Gurdjieff in 1915, Ouspensky spent the next few years studying with him, and supporting the founding of a school.\n\nDenying the ultimate reality of space and time in his book \"Tertium Organum\", he also negates Aristotle's Logical Formula of Identification of \"A is A\" and finally concludes in his \"higher logic\" that A is both A and not-A.\n\nUnbeknown to Ouspensky, a Russian émigré by the name of Nicholas Bessarabof took a copy of \"Tertium Organum\" to America and placed it in the hands of the architect Claude Bragdon who could read Russian and was interested in the fourth dimension. \"Tertium Organum\" was rendered into English by Bragdon who had incorporated his own design of the hypercube into the Rochester Chamber of Commerce building. Bragdon also published the book and the publication was such a success that it was finally taken up by Alfred A. Knopf. At the time, in the early 1920s, Ouspensky's whereabouts were unknown until Bragdon located him in Constantinople and paid him back some royalties.\n\nOuspensky's lectures in London were attended by such literary figures as Aldous Huxley, T. S. Eliot, Gerald Heard and other writers, journalists and doctors. His influence on the literary scene of the 1920s and 1930s as well as on the Russian avant-garde was immense but still very little known. It was said of Ouspensky that, though nonreligious, he had one prayer: not to become famous during his lifetime.\n\nOuspensky also provided an original discussion of the nature and expression of sexuality in his \"A New Model of the Universe\"; among other things, he draws a distinction between erotica and pornography.\n\nDuring his years in Moscow, Ouspensky wrote for several newspapers and was particularly interested in the then-fashionable idea of the fourth dimension. His first published work was titled \"The Fourth Dimension\" and he explored the subject along the ideas prevalent at the time in the works of Charles H. Hinton, the fourth dimension being an extension in space. Ouspensky treats time as a fourth dimension only indirectly in a novel he wrote titled \"Strange Life of Ivan Osokin\" where he also explores the theory of eternal recurrence.\n\nAfter the Bolshevik revolution, Ouspensky travelled to London by way of Istanbul.\nG. R. S. Mead became interested in the fourth dimension and Lady Rothermere, wife of Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, the press magnate, was willing to spread the news of Ouspenky's \"Tertium Organum\", while Ouspensky's acquaintance A. R. Orage was telling others about Ouspensky. By order of the British government, Gurdjieff was not allowed to settle in London. Gurdjieff finally went to France with a considerable sum of money raised by Ouspensky and his friends and settled down near Paris at the Prieuré in Fontainebleau-Avon. It was during this time, after Gurdjieff founded his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in France, that Ouspensky came to the conclusion that he was no longer able to understand his former teacher and made a decision to discontinue association with him, setting up his own organisation, The Society for the Study of Normal Psychology, which is now known as The Study Society.\n\nNevertheless, Ouspensky wrote about Gurdjieff's teachings in a book originally entitled \"Fragments of an Unknown Teaching\", only published posthumously in 1947 under the title \"In Search of the Miraculous\". While this volume has been criticized by some of those who have followed Gurdjieff's teachings as only a partial representation of the totality of his ideas, it nevertheless provides what is probably the most concise explanation of the material that was included. This is in sharp contrast to the writings of Gurdjieff himself, such as \"Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson\", where the ideas and precepts of Gurdjieff's teachings are found very deeply veiled in allegory. Initially, Ouspensky had intended this book to be published only if \"Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson\" were not published. But after his death, Mme Ouspensky showed its draft to Gurdjieff who praised its accuracy and permitted its publication.\n\nOuspensky died in Lyne Place, Surrey, in 1947. Shortly after his death, \"The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution\" was published, together with \"In Search of the Miraculous\". A facsimile edition of \"In Search of the Miraculous\" was published in 2004 by Paul H. Crompton Ltd. London. Transcripts of some of his lectures were published under the title of \"The Fourth Way\" in 1957; largely a collection of question and answer sessions, the book details important concepts, both introductory and advanced, for students of these teachings.\n\nOuspensky's papers are held at Yale University Library's Manuscripts and Archives department.\n\nAfter Ouspensky broke away from Gurdjieff, he taught the \"Fourth Way\", as he understood it, to his independent groups.\n\nGurdjieff proposed that there are three ways of self-development generally known in esoteric circles. These are the Way of the Fakir, dealing exclusively with the physical body, the Way of the Monk, dealing with the emotions, and the Way of the Yogi, dealing with the mind. What is common about the three ways is that they demand complete seclusion from the world. According to Gurdjieff, there is a Fourth Way which does not demand its followers to abandon the world. The work of self-development takes place right in the midst of ordinary life. Gurdjieff called his system a school of the Fourth Way where a person learns to work in harmony with his physical body, emotions and mind. Ouspensky picked up this idea and continued his own school along this line.\n\nOuspensky made the term \"Fourth Way\" and its use central to his own teaching of the ideas of Gurdjieff. He greatly focused on Fourth Way schools and their existence throughout history.\n\nStudents\n\nAmong his students were Rodney Collin, Maurice Nicoll, Robert S de Ropp, Kenneth Walker, Remedios Varo and Dr Francis Roles.\n\nOuspensky personally confessed the difficulties he was experiencing with \"self-remembering,\" which has later been defined by Osho as 'witnessing'. The present phraseology in the teachings of Advaita is to be in awareness, or being aware of being aware. It is also believed to be consistent with the Buddhist practice of 'mindfulness'. The ultimate goal of each is to be always in a state of meditation even in sleep. It was a technique to which he had been introduced by Gurdjieff himself. Gurdjieff explained to him this was the missing link to everything else. While in Russia, Ouspensky himself experimented with the technique with a certain degree of success and in his lectures in London and America, he emphasized its practice. The technique requires a division of attention, so that a person not only pays attention to what is going on in the exterior world but also in the interior. A.L. Volinsky, an acquaintance of Ouspensky in Russia mentioned to Ouspensky that this was what professor Wundt meant by apperception. Ouspensky disagreed and noted how an idea so profound to him would pass unnoticed by people whom he considered intelligent. Gurdjieff explained the Rosicrucian principle that in order to bring about a result or manifestation, three things are necessary. With self-remembering and self-observation two things are present. The third one is explained by Ouspensky in his tract on Conscience: it is the non-expression of negative emotions.\n\nSelf-Knowledge\n\nAccording to Beryl Pogson, author of \"The Work Life\", \"...the only real poverty is lack of self-knowledge.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1325327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1325327", "title": "Pierre Gemayel", "text": "Pierre Gemayel\n\nSheikh Pierre Gemayel () (6 November 1905 – 29 August 1984) (last name also spelt Jmayyel, Jemayyel or al-Jumayyil; Sheikh is an honorific title in Arab countries) was a Lebanese political leader. He is remembered as the founder of the Kataeb Party (also known as the Phalangist Party), as a parliamentary powerbroker, and as the father of Bachir Gemayel and Amine Gemayel, both of whom were elected to the Presidency of the Republic in his lifetime. He opposed the French Mandate over Lebanon in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and advocated an independent state, free from foreign control. He was known for his deft political maneuvering, which led him to take positions which were seen by supporters as pragmatic, but by opponents as contradictory, or even hypocritical. Although publicly sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, he later changed his position due to Palestinian support of the Lebanese National Movement and its calls to end the National Pact and establish non-sectarian democracy.\n\nPierre Gemayel was born on 6 November 1905 in Bikfaya, Lebanon into a Maronite family. His father Amine Bachir Gemayel, known as Abou Ali, and his uncle were forced to flee to Egypt after being sentenced to death in 1914 for opposing Ottoman rule, returning to Lebanon only at the end of World War I.\n\nGemayel was educated at Jesuit school. He went on to study pharmacy at the French faculty of medicine in Beirut, where he later opened a pharmacy. He owned a pharmacy in Haifa, Palestine. The pharmacy was located in Sahat Al Hanatir (Carriage Square).\n\nHe also took an interest in sport, and attended the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin. After the games, he also visited various Central European countries.\n\nOn his return to Lebanon later that year, Gemayel founded Al Kataeb Al Loubnaniyyah party (Phalangist Party a.k.a. Kataeb Party) with Georges Naqqache, Charles Helou, Chafic Nassif and Hamid Franjieh, who was later replaced with Emile Yared, modelling the party after the Spanish and Italian Fascist parties he had observed there. Gemayel was also influenced from the Sokol movement of Czechoslovakia during this visit to the Central Europe after the 1936 Olympic games, and employed the doctrine of this movement while founding the Kataeb party. Kataeb Party is described as a right-wing Christian Party.\n\nThe foundation of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party by Antun Saadeh in 1932 was the trigger for the establishment of the Kateb Party, since the former actively tried to influence Lebanon towards the Syrian interests, leading to direct challenge for Lebanese nationalists. The founders of the Kataeb Party were young, French-educated and middle-class professionals who committed to independent and Western-oriented Lebanon. Charles Helou, who later served as Lebanon's President from 1964 to 1970, was one of the founders. By the time of his presidency, however, Helou was no longer a party member, and Gemayel unsuccessfully opposed him in the presidential election of 1964.\n\nIn the years before and after Lebanon's independence, Gemayel's influence and that of the Kataeb Party was limited. It survived a French attempt to forcibly dissolve it in 1937 and took part in an uprising against the French Mandate in 1943, but despite its membership of 35,000, it operated on the fringes of Lebanese politics. It was not until the Civil War of 1958, that Gemayel emerged as a leader of the far right-wing separatist (mainly Christian) movement that opposed a Nasserist and Arab-nationalist inspired attempt to overthrow the government of president Camille Chamoun and supported the return of foreign troops to Lebanon. In the aftermath of the war, Gemayel was appointed a cabinet minister in a four-member Unity government. Two years later, Gemayel was elected to the National Assembly, from a Beirut constituency, a seat he held for the rest of his life. In 1958, Gemayel was appointed deputy to then prime minister Rashid Karami. By the end of the 1960s, the Kataeb Party held 9 seats in the National Assembly, making it one of the largest groupings in Lebanon's notoriously fractured and sectarian parliament. Although his bids for the presidency in 1964 and 1970 were unsuccessful, Gemayel continued to hold cabinet posts intermittently throughout the remaining quarter-century of his life. For instance, he was minister of public works in 1970. \n\nLebanon has long been a battleground in the Israeli-Arab conflict, and Gemayel's position was always solid and consistent advocating a Lebanon separated from the other Arab states and linked to France and the West. He opposed the presence of the Palestinian refugees. His supporters viewed this as a sign of strength and patriotism, while his detractors saw it as incoherent. Gemayel reluctantly signed the Cairo Agreement of 1969 under enormous pressure from the international community, which allowed Palestinian guerrillas to set up bases on Lebanese soil, from which to carry out actions against Israel. He later defended his actions, saying that Lebanon really had no choice. In the 1970s, he came to oppose the armed Palestinian presence in Lebanon. The Kataeb created a military Security Council led by William Hawi, which came to be commanded by Gemayel's son Bachir upon the assassination of Hawi.\n\nGemayel was also to reverse his position on The Syrian intervention in the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990. He initially welcomed Syrian intervention on the side of the Christians and against the Lebanese National Movement, but he soon became convinced that Syria was occupying Lebanon for reasons of its own. In 1976, he joined other mainly Christian leaders, including former president Camille Chamoun, the diplomat Charles Malik, and the Guardians of the Cedars leader Étienne Saqr, to oppose the Syrians. On 11 October 1978, Gemayel bitterly denounced the Syrian military presence, and the Lebanese Front joined the Lebanese regular army in a successful \"Hundred Days War\" against the Syrian army.\n\nGemayel saw his younger son, Bachir Gemayel, elected president of Lebanon on 23 August 1982, only to be assassinated on 14 September, nine days before his scheduled inauguration. Bachir's older brother, Amine Gemayel was elected to replace him. Pierre Gemayel himself initially stayed out of Amine Gemayel's government, but in early 1984, after participating in two conferences in Geneva and Lausanne, Switzerland, aimed at ending the civil war and the occupation of the country by Israeli troops in 1982, he agreed to serve once more in a cabinet of national unity that was formed by Rashid Karami in May 1984. He served as the minister of public health and communications in the cabinet led by then prime minister Karami.\n\nGemayel was still in office when he died of a heart attack in Bikfaya on 29 August 1984. He was at the age of 78. Gemayel's body was buried next to Bashir Gemayel's grave in Bikfaya on 30 August 1984.\n\nGemayel was married to Genevieve Gemayel, and they celebrated the 50th anniversary of their marriage in August 1984. They had six children. His younger son, Bachir Gemayel was assassinated on 14 September 1982 after being elected to the presidency. His grandson Pierre Amine Gemayel, then industry minister, was similarly assassinated on 21 November 2006. Several other descendants of Pierre Gemayel, including two grandchildren, were also murdered during the civil war period.\n\n"}

Mailhat served on the society's management council in 1894 (and again in 1912) Advertisements for his company's telescopes appeared regularly in the pages of the society’s bulletin.\n\nThe Maison Mailhat and its fellow Paris-based competitors the Secrétan and Bardou companies were among the leading French precision optics manufacturers of the early twentieth century. Mailhat telescopes and optical products were widely exported to Europe, the United States and even further afield. \n\nFerdinand Quénisset used Mailhat lenses for early photographs of Mars in 1899 at the Camille Flammarion Observatory in Juvisy.\n\nOn 1 April 1908, the company’s offices and workshops moved to 10, rue Emile-Dubois Paris, close to the Paris Observatory. The following year, Mailhat sold his company to Francis Mouronval (1881-1954). Mouronval continued to produce and sell telescopes under the Maison Mailhat name for seven years. Following Mouronval's mobilisation durign the World War II, he publicly announced in 1916 that the Mailhat-Mouronval company was closed \"for the duration of the war\". This closure appears to have been definitive.\n\nDuring the war, Mailhat served as ‘’Officier de l’administration de 3e classe territorial’’ in the Service des fabrications de l'aviation (military aircraft manufacturing). For his contribution to the war effort, he received the Légion d’Honneur in 1918.\n\nMailhat died on 22 April 1923 at his home at 13, rue Boileau in Montrouge (Seine).\n\n\n\n"}

This interest eventually led her to enroll as a student of literature and philosophy in the Faculty of Humanities in the University of Warsaw, graduating with a degree in anthropology. Upon receiving her degree in 1935, she attended graduate school at Columbia University, where she received her doctorate in 1944. Also at this time (1936) she first made known at a seminar in Warsaw her theory that \"calamus\" in the Bible is hemp.\n\nBenet discovered that the Biblical plants or spices \"kaneh\" (Ez. 27:19; Is. 43:24; Ct. 4:14), \"kaneh ha-tob\" (Je. 6:20), and \"kaneh-bosem\" (Ex. 30:23), which are usually translated as \"sweet calamus\" or \"sweet cane\", were actually hemp. \"Kaneh-bosem\" was an ingredient of the holy anointing oil:\n\nThis ingredient is, however, not mentioned amongst those prescribed in Ex. 30:34, from which the incense (ketoret) for the Temple was to be prepared.\n\nAccording to Julius Wellhausen's documentary hypothesis, Ex. 30:23 belongs to a priestly (P) source, composed sometime between the 8th and the mid-6th century B.C.\n\nBased on similar words in cognate languages (Sanskrit śana, Assyrian qunnabu, Persian kenab, Arabic kanab) Benet concluded that \"kaneh\" and \"kaneh-bosem\" refer to hemp. In many ancient languages, including Hebrew, the root \"kan\" had a double meaning, both hemp and reed. The error originated from the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, Septuagint, in the third century B.C., where the terms \"kaneh\" and \"kaneh-bosem\" had been (mis)translated as \"sweet kalamos\". In the many Bible translations that followed, including Martin Luther's, the same error was repeated. Benet further claimed that the Scythians, who were described by Herodotus as ritual hemp users in the fifth century B.C., were at least one millennium older than has been previously assumed.\n\nSulah Benet's claim has found increased support in the academic community among lexicographers and botanists. The standard reference lexicons of Biblical Hebrew, and reference works on Hebrew Bible plants by scholars such as University of Jerusalem botanist Michael Zohary mention Benet's suggestion, while others argue the word refers to an either different species of hemp or a different plant entirely. Celsius (Hierobotanicon) has suggested sweet flag (Acorus calamus), which grows in Egypt, Judaea, and Syria, containing in its stalk a soft white pith with an agreeable aromatic smell, and forming an ingredient of the richest perfumes. Royle identified the \"sweet cane\" (A.V.) of Scripture (Is. 43:24; Je. 6:20) with the Andropogon calamus, a plant extensively cultivated in India, from which an oil, deemed to be the famous spikenard of antiquity, is extracted. According to Boissier (Flora Orientalis), \"kaneh\" was the common marsh reed, Arundo donax L. Some biblical scholars and botanists believe that the qaneh is probably sugarcane.\n\nIn Hebrew, \"kanebas\", \"kanebiys\", \"kanebos\" (), derived from Greek \"kannabis\", first appear in the Mishnah (Kilayim 2:5; 5:8; 9:1, 5, 7). The Jerusalem Talmud (Kilayim 9:5, 32d) notes that while in mishnaic times hemp was an important commodity because of the difficulty of cultivating linen, in the days of the Amoraim linen replaced it.\n\n\n"}

Today, Evans-Wentz is best known for four texts translated from the Tibetan: \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\" (1927), \"Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa\" (1928), \"Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines\" (1935), and \"The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation\" (1954).\n\nWalter was born as Walter Yeeling Wentz in Trenton, New Jersey in 1878. His father Christopher Wentz (1836 - February 4, 1921) - born in Weissengen, Baden, Germany - had emigrated to America with his parents in 1846. At the turn of the century (1900) Christopher was a real estate developer in Pablo Beach, Florida. Walter's mother (and Christopher's 1st wife) - Mary Evans Cook (died 1898) - was of Irish heritage. Christopher and Mary were married on August 11, 1862 in Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey. Christopher's 2nd wife (they were married on June 4, 1900 in Duval County, Florida) was Olivia F. Bradford (1863-1949). Walter had two brothers and two sisters. Though initially a Baptist, Walter's father had turned to spiritualism and Theosophy. As a teenager, Walter read Madame Blavatsky's \"Isis Unveiled\" and \"The Secret Doctrine\" in his father's library, and became interested in the teachings of Theosophy and the occult. Subsequently, at the turn of century, Walter moved to San Diego, California to join his father's profession, but also because it was close to Lomaland, the American headquarters for the Theosophical Society, which he joined in 1901.\n\nAt age 24 Evans-Wentz went to Stanford University, where he studied religion, philosophy, and history and was deeply influenced by visitors William James and W. B. Yeats. He went on to receive B.A. and M.A degrees. He then studied Celtic mythology and folklore at Jesus College, Oxford (1907). He performed ethnographic fieldwork collecting fairy folklore in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man. In 1911 Evans-Wentz published his degree thesis as a book, \"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries\". While at Oxford, he added his mother's Welsh surname Evans to his name, being known henceforth as Evans-Wentz.\n\nAt Oxford, Evans-Wentz met archaeologist and British Army officer T.E. Lawrence, who advised him to travel to the Orient.\n\nThereafter, funded by his rental properties in Florida, he started travelling extensively, spending time in Mexico, Europe, and the Far East. He spent the years of the First World War in Egypt. He boarded a ship from Port Said, Egypt for Colombo, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). Here he started studying the history, customs and religious traditions of the country, and also collected a large number of important Pali manuscripts, which were later donated to Stanford University. Next in 1918, he travelled across India, covering important religious sites, \"seeking wise men of the east\". He met spiritual figures like Yogananda, J. Krishnamurti, Paul Brunton, Ramana Maharishi, Sri Krishna Prem and Shunyata. He also visited the Theosophical Society Adyar, where he met Annie Besant and Swami Shyamananda Giri (1911-1971).\n\nFinally he reached Darjeeling in 1919; there he encountered Tibetan religious texts firsthand, when he acquired a Tibetan manuscript of Karma Lingpa's \"Liberation through Hearing during the Intermediate State\" (or \"Bardo Thodol\") from Major Campbell, a British officer who had just returned from Tibet. He next met Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup (1868–1922), an English teacher and headmaster at Maharaja's Boys School, in Gangtok, Sikkim. Samdup had been with 13th Dalai Lama during the latter's exile years in India in 1910; more importantly for Evans-Wentz, he had already worked as a translator with Alexandra David-Néel, the Belgian-French explorer, travel writer, and Buddhist convert, and Sir John Woodroffe, noted British Orientalist.\n\nFor the next two months, Evans-Wentz spent morning hours before the opening of the school with Samdup working on the text. During this period, they worked out the origins of what was to become \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\". Evans-Wentz soon left for the Swami Satyananda's ashram, where he was practicing yoga. Samdup meanwhile was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Calcutta, in the same year, and died in Calcutta three years later, long before the book could be finally published.\n\nIn 1927, \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\" was published by Oxford University Press. Evans-Wentz chose the title \"Book of the Dead\" because it reminded him of the Egyptian \"Book of the Dead\". For Westerners, the book would become a principal reference on Tibetan Buddhism. Evans-Wentz credited himself only as the compiler and editor of these volumes; the actual translation was performed by Tibetan Buddhists, primarily Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup. Evans-Wentz's interpretations and organization of this Tibetan material is hermeneutically controversial, being influenced by preconceptions he brought to the subject from Theosophy and other metaphysical schools.\n\nThis book was followed by \"Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa\" (1928), also based on Samdup's translations. Evans-Wentz was a practitioner of the religions he studied. He became Dawa-Samdup's \"disciple\" (E-W's term), wore robes, and ate a simple vegetarian diet. In 1935, he met Ramana Maharshi and went to Darjeeling, where he employed three translators, Sikkimese of Tibetan descent, to translate another text which was published as \"Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines\" (1935).\n\nEvans-Wentz intended to settle permanently in India, but was compelled by World War II to return to the U.S. There he would publish \"The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation\" in 1954. A final work, \"Cuchama and Sacred Mountains\" (1989), was published posthumously.\n\nIn 1946, he wrote the preface to Yogananda's well known \"Autobiography of a Yogi\", that introduced both Yogananda and himself to wider audiences in a book which has been in print for over sixty-five years and translated into at least thirty-four languages. Evans-Wentz remains best known his lasting legacy to Tibetology.\n\nEvans-Wentz remained a Theosophist for the rest of his life, writing articles for Theosophical publications and provided financial support to the Maha Bodhi Society, Self-Realization Fellowship, and the Theosophical Society. He lived for 23 years at the Keystone Hotel in San Diego. Evans-Wentz spent his last months at Yogananda's Self-Realization Fellowship in Encinitas, California and died in July 1965. His \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" was read at his funeral.\n\nThe Department of Religious Studies at Stanford University has hosted \"The Evans-Wentz Lectureship in Asian Philosophy, Religion, and Ethics\" since 1969, funded by a bequest from Evans-Wentz.\n\n\n\n\n"}
