It was his seventh visit to the United States and his first visit after succeeding the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012. During the period of the visit, Xi attended the US–China Internet Industry Forum, visited the White House and met US President Barack Obama, and attended the 70th anniversary of the United Nations.\n\nXi's visit occurred at a time of high tensions in China-US relations. The Wall Street Journal quoted experts who said Xi's US visit was to promote local technology companies and to ask the US government to not retaliate in response to accusations regarding the People's Republic of China having engaged in hacking activities, but Beijing has repeatedly denied the allegations of the United States. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi's visit was to promote trust between the two countries.\n\nBefore this visit, the United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China held a hearing on human rights. Experts and members of Congress in attendance called on President Obama to ask Xi Jinping to stop the persecution of Tibetans, Uyghurs, religious groups, non-governmental organizations, intellectuals, democracy advocates, and supporters of \"universal suffrage\" in Hong Kong.\n\nXi had previously visited the United States six times. His first visit was as part of a corn industry delegation to the state of Iowa in 1985. His most recent visit in 2013 was informal, in which he went to Sunnylands in California, and met with US President Barack Obama.\n\nOn September 22, 2015, Xi Jinping, and his wife, Peng Liyuan, arrived at Paine Field and stepped off an Air China aircraft at about 9:30 am (Pacific Daylight Time). Before his arrival at the Westin Seattle Hotel, protesters gathered downtown to highlight the Chinese government's human rights abuses and to voice other concerns, including Falun Gong practitioners. Supporters of Xi were also present with Chinese flags. The protesters dispersed by 6:00 pm.\n\nIn the evening, Xi attended a banquet speech at the Westin Seattle Hotel, meeting with Governor of Washington State Jay Inslee, Mayor of Seattle Ed Murray, Senator Patty Murray, Congressman Rick Larsen, and former US Ambassador to China Gary Locke. In his speech, he mentioned several contentious issues in China–US relations, including on cybersecurity and China's economy. Xi's speech cited elements of American culture, included \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and the poet Walt Whitman. He also talked about his teenage years working on a farm in Yanchuan County, Shaanxi, China, during the Cultural Revolution. He linked this to the Chinese Dream, an individual work ethic which would strengthen the Chinese nation as a whole. Xi reiterated that China is against currency wars and will not lower the renminbi rate to boost exports. On the topic of his anti-corruption reforms, Xi said, \"It has nothing to do with a power struggle. In this case, there's no \"House of Cards\"\" – a reference to the Netflix political drama, which tops the list of most illegally downloaded shows in China.\n\nOn the second day of his trip, Xi visited Boeing Everett factory and viewed the final assembly lines for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Boeing 777 and Boeing 747-8. Xi announced China will buy 300 Boeing aircraft, included 250 single-aisle Boeing 737s and 50 widebody jets for US$38 billion and build its first factory in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China. It will be Boeing's first non-US factory. The Chinese company Inspur and Cisco Systems said they will jointly sell networking technologies and products in China.\n\nAfter his Boeing visit, Xi attended an Internet industry forum held at the headquarters of Microsoft, located in Redmond. He said China would prioritize Internet security and defended self-governance at the country level with respect to Internet regulations. Thirty US and Chinese technology executives attended this forum and posed for a photo with Xi and Chief of the State Internet Information Office Lu Wei, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, Amazon.com's CEO Jeff Bezos, Alibaba's CEO Jack Ma, and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella. Executives from Google and Uber, did not appear in this photo. Before photographing, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg spoke to Xi in Mandarin. On September 21, \"The Washington Post\" reported that technology executives were recommended to attend this forum, or risk their companies facing greater regulatory scrutiny in China.\n\nXi also visited Microsoft, where he met with Bill and Melinda Gates as well as senior executives and board members of the company. He had the opportunity to preview new technologies being developed by Microsoft. Nadella gifted him a 3D printed model of the \"Liulinhai\", the first Chinese ship to dock in the United States, in Seattle, in 1979 after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn the afternoon, Xi Jinping visited Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington. He provided opportunities for students to experience Chinese music, government and culture. Lincoln's football players presented Xi with a Lincoln Abes jersey emblazoned with the number \"1\". Xi reciprocated with gifts of books and ping-pong equipment. He also invited 100 Lincoln High students to visit China in 2016. During this visit, the adherents of Falun Gong and Vietnamese protesters held up signs such as \"Stop Red China's Violations\" and shouted slogans such as \"Down with Red China\".\n\nXi attended a forum hosted by the Paulson Foundation, an economic think tank founded by Henry Paulson. He also attended a dinner organized by local Chinese.\n\nXi and Peng left Seattle and flew to Washington, D.C. on September 24. They arrived at Joint Base Andrews and were greeted by United States Vice President Joe Biden. After greeting, a band played the US and Chinese national anthems. Then Xi and Obama had a private working dinner at the Blair House.\n\nOn September 25, Xi Jinping arrived at the White House. President Barack Obama welcomed Xi's visit. After the welcoming ceremony, Xi and Obama held their discussion in the White House. During this discussion, they mentioned peacekeeping, nuclear security, health, environment, cybersecurity, law enforcement and counterterrorism. Xi said that China would develop a \"national carbon emissions trading market\" in 2017, as a part of climate change statement. Later they held a news conference at Rose Garden. Obama and Xi reached a \"common understanding\" that neither the United States nor China should engage in state-sponsored cyberintrusions, and they would together seek the rules for appropriate conduct in cyberspace.\n\nIn the evening, Obama held a state dinner for Xi Jinping. It was Obama's second state dinner for a Chinese President. The White House invited Anita Lo, an Asian-American chef, to serve as a guest chef and to design the menu with Chinese elements. This state dinner's guests included US technology executives like Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Larry Ellison, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Obama said that China and the US together are \"stronger when we accept the diversity of the views and the contributions and uphold the rights of all our people\".\n\nOn September 26, Xi Jinping flew to New York City and attended the UN Sustainable Development Summit at the Headquarters of the United Nations. In his speech, he foresaw that \"the world would seek an equitable, open, comprehensive and innovation-driven development path in an effort to achieve common development of all countries after 2015\". He also announced the establishment of a South–South cooperation assistance fund. China will contribute US$2 billion to the fund to encourage developing countries to undertake the post-2015 development agenda. In addition, Xi has floated many important initiatives, such as the BRICS Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Silk Road Fund.\n\nDuring this visit, over 100 protesters held banners near the Headquarters of the United Nations, the Chinese consulate in New York City, the Chinese permanent mission to the UN, and Xi's hotel, the Waldorf Astoria New York. They called for Xi to prosecute the former leader of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin.\n\nOn September 27, Xi Jinping and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon co-hosted the \"2015 Global Women's Summit\". In his speech, Xi said, \"As the Chinese people pursue a happy life, all Chinese women have the opportunity to excel in life and make their dreams come true\". He also announced China would contribute USD $10 million to UN Women. However, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized his attendance, considering women's rights abuses in China.\n\nPeng Liyuan attended UNESCO's Special Envoy for the Advancement of Girls' and Women's Education. Peng spoke in English, the first time she showed her fluency in the language to a large gathering. She said her Chinese Dream is that \"all children especially girls can have access to good education\".\n\nXi also attended the Leaders Working Lunch on Climate Change of the UN. He said China will control greenhouse gas emissions and put \"China's South–South Cooperation Fund on Climate Change\" into operation.\n\nXi gave a speech at the General Debate of the 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. He mentioned the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day of the Second World War in China and emphasized that commemorating history is not revenge. Xi also said all economies should be built on an eco-environment, and green, low-carbon circular sustainable development platform. He also pledged US$100 million, over a period of five years, to the African Union.\n\n"}

It is built from the Arabic words \"Abd\", \"al-\" and \"Rashid\". The name means \"servant of the right-minded\", \"Ar-Rashīd\" being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.\n\nThe letter \"a\" of the \"al-\" is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by \"u\". Because the letter \"r\" is a sun letter, the letter \"l\" of the \"al-\" is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to \"Abd al-Rashid\", the usual pronunciation corresponds to \"Abd ar-Rashid\".

He succeeded Sani Abacha upon Abacha's death. During his leadership, Nigeria adopted a modified version of the 1979 constitution, which provided for multiparty elections. He transferred power to president-elect Olusegun Obasanjo on 29 May 1999.\n\nAbubakar was born on 13 June 1942 to his father Abubakar Jibrin and his mother Fatikande Mohammed, in Minna, Niger State, Nigeria. From 1950-1956 he attended Minna Native Authority Primary school. From 1957-1962, he had his secondary school education at Government College, Bida, Niger state. From January to October 1963 he studied at Kaduna Technical College.\n\nAbubakar is a member of the pioneering sets of officer cadets who enlisted into the Nigerian Air force on 3 October 1963. From 1964- 1966, he was flown to Uetersen, Western Germany with a team of officer cadets, for Basic and Advance Military Training. When he returned to Nigeria in 1966 he was seconded to the Nigeria Army.\n\nAfter joining the army in 1966 as an officer cadet, Abubakar attended the emergency combatant short service course two. In October 1967, Abubakar was commissioned second lieutenant, infantry division, Nigerian army.\n\nFrom 1967-1968, Abubakar was general staff officer two, second garrison, and commanding officer, 92 infantry battalion from 1969-1974. Between 1974 and 1975, he was made brigade major, 7th infantry brigade.\n\nIn 1975 he served as commanding officer, 84 infantry battalion.

Between 1991-1993, he was the principal staff officer, as the army chief of plan and policy, Defence Headquarters.\n\nFrom 1993-1998, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha appointed Abubakar as the Chief of Defence Staff, Defence Headquarters.\n\nUpon Abacha’s death on 8 June 1998, Abubakar took power as the military president of Nigeria and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces on 9 June 1998.\n\nIn May 1999 General Abubakar, handed over power to the newly elected civilian president, Olusegun Obasanjo and retired from the army.\n\nNigeria had been ruled by military leaders since Muhammadu Buhari seized power from Shehu Shagari in a 1983 coup.\nAlthough democratic elections had been held in 1993, they were annulled by General Ibrahim Babangida. Reported to have had an initial reluctance to accepting the position, Abubakar was sworn in as president on 9 June 1998 after the unexpected death of Abacha. He declared a weeklong period of national mourning.\n\nA few days after assuming office, Abubakar promised to hold elections within a year and transfer power to an elected president.\nHe established the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), appointing former Supreme Court Justice Ephraim Akpata as chairman.\nThe INEC held a series of elections first for Local Government Areas in December 1998, then for State Assemblies and Governors, National Assemblies and finally for the President on 27 February 1999. Although efforts were made to ensure that the elections were free and fair, there were widespread irregularities that drew criticism from foreign observers.\n\nSurprising some critics of the country's military, Abubakar kept his word and transferred power to elected president Obasanjo on 29 May 1999. During his administration Nigeria adopted a new constitution May 5, 1999, which went into effect when Olusegun Obasanjo became president.\n\nAbubakar's legacy is mixed. A lecture circuit at Chicago State University in Chicago, Illinois, United States featuring him encountered opposition, because he had supported Abacha's government. (Abacha's administration was notorious for its human rights abuses). He was also sued in that country by other Nigerians who claimed he was responsible for the death of 1993 president-elect Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, who died in custody after being prevented by the military from taking office, and for the violation of the rights of others during his administration.\n\nAbubakar helped in the Liberian peace movement by presiding over the 2003 peace talks between Charles Taylor and the opposing rebels. This is seen in the movie \"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\".\n\nAbubakar is married to Fati and they have six children together.\n\nAbudulsalami Abubakar has received several awards and medals.

{"id": "32028621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32028621", "title": "Antonio Vallejo-Nájera", "text": "Antonio Vallejo-Nájera\n\nAntonio Vallejo-Nájera (1889–1960) was a Spanish psychiatrist.\n\nVallejo-Nájera was born in Paredes de Nava in 1889. He studied medicine at the University of Valladolid and joined the army’s sanitary corps in 1910, taking part in the Rif War between 1912 and 1915. During World War I he was posted to the military department at the Spanish Embassy in Berlin. There he met well-known figures of German Psychiatry such as Gruhle, Schwalb and Kraepelin. He also conducted inspections of prisoner of war concentration camps, an activity for which he was awarded medals by Belgium and France after the war. On returning to Spain he worked at the Ciempozuelos Military Psychiatric Clinic. When the Civil War broke out he was a teacher of Psychiatry in the Military Sanitary Academy.\n\nVallejo Nájera promoted in Spain a personal notion of eugenics, intending to reconcile German doctrines of racial hygiene from authors like Schwalb with the requirements of Catholic moral doctrine, opposed to state-imposed measures of eugenic restriction. He advocated \"eugamia\", a eugenic policy implemented through premarital orientation work based on the biopsychological assessment of a couple’s personality.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War he supported the nationalists. In 1938, he set up the \"Gabinete de Investigaciones Psicológicas de la Inspección de Campos de Concentración de Prisioneros de Guerra\" (Psychological Research Bureau of Inspection of Prisoner of War Concentration Camps), a center for psychological investigations. The bureau was established near the San Pedro de Cardeña concentration camp and had fourteen clinics in the nationalist zone. Vallejo Najera carried out experiments on female Spanish Republican Army and International Brigades prisoners to establish \"the bio-psychic roots of Marxism\" and find the \"red gene\". For Vallejo Najera, Marxists were genetic retards and Marxism was a mental illness: \"A priori, it seems probable that psychopaths of all types would join the Marxist ranks... Since Marxism goes together with social immorality... we presume those fanatics who fought with arms will show schizoid temperaments\".\n\nVallejo’s conclusions were that the only way to prevent the racial dissolution of the Spanish was to take away the \"red\" children from their mothers in places \"away from democratic environments and where the exaltation of bio-psychic racial qualities is encouraged\". By 1943, 12,043 children had been taken from their mothers and handed over to orphanages or Francoist families, but the number of children taken away from their parents may be closer to 30,000. Furthermore, many children evacuated by the Republic to France, England and elsewhere, were forced to return against the will of their parents. In some cases birth records were destroyed and the children's names changed in order to prevent any further contact with their parents.\n\nVallejo Najera contributed to the justification of the Francoist post-war repression. He said that the \"reds\" should: \"suffer the punishment they deserve, with death the easiest of them all. Some will live in permanent exile... Others will lose their freedom, groaning for years in prisons, purging their crimes with forced work in order to earn their daily bread...\". According to Paul Preston the \"investigations\" of Vallejo-Najera provided the Francoist State with \"scientific\" arguments in order to \"justify their views on the subhuman nature of their adversaries\". According to the Spanish psychiatrist Carlos Castillo del Pino: \"For Vallejo Nagera, reds were degenerates and if they were allowed to breed they would enfeeble the Spanish race. Therefore, they had to be exterminated.\"\n\nWhen the Civil War ended, Vallejo's support for Francoism was rewarded by his appointment as Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Madrid. \"He became one of the most influential figures in Spanish Psychiatry and Psychology in the forties and fifties: his name is among the 16 founders of the Spanish Psychological Society.\"\n\nHe died in 1960.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is widely known for his comedic and villain roles in Bollywood films such as \"Don\", \"Munna Bhai MBBS\", \"3 Idiots\", \"Happy New Year\", \"PK\" and \"Dilwale\".\n\nIrani was born on 2 December 1959, in Mumbai. He finished his schooling in St. Mary's School, Mumbai. Irani was dyslexic and had ADHD and had a lisp. He overcame his lisp eventually. He undertook a two-year waiter course at Mithibai College in Mumbai. After his polytechnic diploma course, he joined the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower and worked there as a waiter and in room service. He was promoted and finally worked as a waiter at the rooftop French restaurant, Rendezvous. He worked at the Taj Mahal for two years.\n\nWhile he was at school, he would watch movies daily at the Alexander Cinema daily after school. His mother often encouraged him to watch the movies repeatedly, to observe their cinematography and art. Irani's father died three months before Irani was born, but had a farsan-making shop, which his mother took over thereafter. Irani also worked at this shop on Grant Road till he was 32 years old. This ancestral bakery and farsan shop was located in the Grant road area of Mumbai, between Novelty and Apsara Cinemas, and was also where he first met his wife.\n\nWhile working at the Taj, using the tips that he received, Irani bought a camera and took sports pictures (school cricket and football matches), selling them for twenty to thirty rupees, which he continued till well after marriage. His epiphany came when he saved money for seven years to take his family for their first ever vacation to Ooty, but they ended up in a desolate run-down hotel called Shawham Palace. Irani decided to take control of his life, and instead of living the petty existence of a photographer selling small photos, he would started to dream and live big and provide more for his family. Irani calls it his \"zero number bulb moment\".\n\nIrani continued to be a photographer, but now at the age of 32, went six months prior to the world boxing championships at Mumbai to meet Adajania, the then president of the Olympic boxing association of India, and requested to become the official photographer of the World Cup. When Adajania told him there was no need for him, Irani offered to work at his office for six months for free in return for a ring-side badge to cover the event. He continued to try to convince Adajania, and covered a state boxing match in a different manner than other photographers. Adajania was impressed by his photos and his passion and appointed Irani as the official photographer.\n\nMeanwhile, he became the photographer for the Norwegian boxing team and photographed specific photos that they needed of Ole Klemetsen. When asked about his charges, Irani asked for the international rate. Irani took the required photos with his K-1000.\n\nIrani began his acting career in theatre and moved to films in 2000. Irani gained attention for his role in the 2003 comedy \"Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.\". He later appeared in \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\" for which he received several IIFA award nominations and in \"3 Idiots\" opposite Aamir khan which earned him a Filmfare Award and a Star Screen Award for Best Actor in a Villainous Role.\n\nActing had been a passion to Irani during school and college days. He trained under acting coach Hansraj Siddhia from 1981 to 1983 and adopted professional acting methods.\n\nIrani's mentor was Alyque Padamsee — the veteran theatre actor best known for his role as Mohammad Ali Jinnah in \"Gandhi\". He was introduced to Padamsee by Shiamak Davar. Irani's earliest theatrical appearance was in \"Roshni\" where he played a cameo at the Regional Theatre in Versova. He followed this up with serials like \"Family Ties\" and \"Mahatma vs Gandhi\", playing Gandhi after the role was turned down by Darshan Jariwala. His most illustrious play to date is \"I am not Bajirao\" which ran for 10 years.\n\nIrani started out in a number of advertisements such as Fanta, Ceat and Krackjack biscuits (as Mr. Jack of the Krack and Jack duo).\n\nHis small but significant role in \"Darna Mana Hai\" earned him acclaim. The film didn't fare too well, but his was one of the most remembered segments of the film along with Saif Ali Khan. With \"Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.\", Irani became popular. His role as J. Asthana earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Comedian. His comic as well as minor antagonist type role in \"3 Idiots\" is also still remembered. Irani has appeared in many comedic roles (\"Main Hoon Na\", \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\", \"Dostana\", \"Khosla Ka Ghosla\", \"\", \"No Entry\", \"Housefull\", \"Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu\", \"Housefull 2\" and \"Cocktail\"), supporting roles (\"Veer-Zaara\", \"Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara\", \"Lakshya\", \"Honeymoon Travels Pvt.

During the mid- to late-2000s, he made a series of disclosures about UBS Group AG clients, in violation of Swiss banking secrecy laws, to the U.S. government alleging possible tax evasion. Known as the 2007 \"\", the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement with UBS that resulted in a US$780 million fine and the release of previously privileged information on American tax evaders.\n\nIn the United States, he was convicted by the DOJ for a single charge of fraud conspiracy and served 40 months in a federal penitentiary from 2010 to 2012 with a fine of $30,000. After he applied for whistleblower status and protection, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) awarded him a settlement of $104 million through their Whistleblower Office. In Switzerland, he is considered a criminal and is subject to arrest if he returns to the country for breaking bank–client confidentiality laws, a federal crime.\n\nBirkenfeld was born on February 26, 1965, in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. His father was a neurosurgeon. Birkenfeld attended Thayer Academy, a prep school, and graduated from Norwich University in Vermont in 1988. Birkenfeld is Jewish, his paternal grandfather, Max, emigrated to the United States from Romania in 1922. He obtained a master's degree at the American Graduate School of Business in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland.\n\nBirkenfeld began his career in banking in the currency trading department of State Street Bank & Trust in Boston. Birkenfeld claims that he first blew the whistle on illegal activities while at State Street, approaching the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1994. The information did not lead to any indictments. He says that he turned down an offer to join the FBI after the incident, but that claim has been disputed. In 1996, he was hired as a private banker at Credit Suisse before moving on to Barclay's Bank in 1998. In October 2001, Birkenfeld began working at UBS in Geneva, Switzerland, again as a private banker offering wealth management services. His principal job responsibility was to solicit wealthy Americans to move their assets to the bank, enabling them to hide their funds due to Switzerland's strict banking secrecy laws and thus avoid paying U.S. taxes. According to Birkenfeld, UBS sponsored events like art shows and yacht races in the United States to attract wealthy people as potential clients.\n\nIn United States\n\nAfter learning about UBS Switzerland AG dealings in the U.S., Birkenfeld resigned on October 5, 2005 and became a partner at Union Charter Ltd., where he specialized in wealth management. In 2007, he disclosed to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) what he knew about UBS's illegal practices attempting to take advantage the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, a law that could pay him up to 30% of any tax revenue recouped by the IRS. However, because he did not provide full and complete information to U.S. authorities, Birkenfeld was arrested in Boston on 7 May 2008 when he deplaned from Switzerland arraigned at the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida on 13 May. Birkenfeld resigned his position with Union Charter on 3 June 2008 after agreeing to plead guilty to not disclosing accurate information. As a private banker, Birkenfeld advised California real estate developer Igor Olenicoff, to evade U.S. taxes worth approximately US$200 million. Olenicoff subsequently pleaded guilty to tax evasion and paid a $52 million fine, but avoided a jail sentence. U.S. District Judge William Zloch charged him with a single count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and sentenced Birkenfeld to 40 months in prison and a $30,000 fine. Birkenfeld served his time at the Schuylkill County Federal Correctional Institution from January 2010 to August 2012. In 2012, as a consequence of his whistleblower status, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) awarded him $104 million, 26% of the total $400 million in taxes returned.\n\nIn Switzerland\n\nBirkenfeld is viewed as a criminal and a \"traitor\" by some members of the Swiss public and banking community as he broke the country's banking secrecy laws. Although he left Switzerland before he disclosed banking client information, had he remained a resident, he would have been prosecuted by Zürich authorities for three and a half years in prison and commensurate fines. When asked if he would ever return to Switzerland, Birkenfeld stated: \"I don't believe I will.\" UBS announced that it would cease providing cross-border private banking services to U.S.-domiciled clients through its non-U.S. regulated units as of July 2008.\n\nAfter Birkenfeld's award, the Swiss newspaper \"Blick\" claimed, “Birkenfeld was a blessing for the Swiss financial industry,” in that his revelations helped accelerate the industry's transition away from its reliance on “dirty” money by dooming the bank secrecy laws that enabled tax evasion.\n\nBirkenfeld has compared the Swiss banking industry with gangsters. \"In essence, bank secrecy is analogous to criminal racketeering — and the Swiss government, along with every Swiss private banker, is a co-conspirator.\"\n\nBrad Birkenfeld's three-year period of parole ran through November 2015; a year previous Birkenfeld's attorney petitioned the U.S. District Court to allow Birkenfeld to travel abroad. While on parole, Birkenfeld engaged with a variety of charitable efforts: he allowed disadvantaged children to use his luxury suite at Boston Bruins hockey games and donated six electric bicycles to the Boston Police Department after the Boston Marathon bombings.\n\nIn January 2015, Birkenfeld was subpoenaed by a French magistrate investigating the abetting of tax evasion and tax fraud by French citizens at UBS. In February 2015, he was allowed to travel to France from 27 February to 1 March 2015 to appear before the French court. The French court is investigating allegations that UBS marketed Swiss numbered bank accounts to French citizens to allow them to hide their assets.\n\n"}

Four years later, he joined the Communist Party and was appointed editor of the party newspaper, \"Hoy\". He graduated from university in 1939. Although he was a participant in the 1935 general strike against provisional President Carlos Mendieta, in 1942, Rodríguez joined the cabinet of President Fulgencio Batista. A \"dedicated Marxist\", Rodríguez's participation in the Batista cabinet marked the high point of the regime's collaboration with the Communist Party.\n\nRodríguez first met Fidel Castro through a mutual friend after Castro visited the Communist Party's bookstore a few days before his disastrous attack on the Moncada Barracks on July 26, 1953. Although Rodríguez denounced the attack after it occurred, he would eventually ally himself with Castro in the Cuban Revolution. In July 1958, he joined the 26th of July Movement in the Sierra Maestra mountain range in support of its guerrilla war against Batista; it was the first such gesture of support by the Communist Party for the rebels.\n\nCastro befriended him, and after his victory, he rewarded Rodríguez with top posts in the Cuban government. From 1962 to 1965, Rodríguez headed the National Institute of Agrarian Reform, and was referred to by some in the foreign press as Cuba's economic czar. In 1969, Castro sent him as an \"observer\" to the International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow, where he gave an important speech declaring that Cuba would \"stand unflinchingly by the USSR\". The speech was one of a series of steps taken by the Castro regime to move closer to the Soviet Union after having publicly disagreed with the Soviets in the early- and mid-1960s. Rodríguez would remain a key figure in Soviet-Cuban relations, providing public statements during times of friendship and discord. Before being sidelined in 1997 with deteriorating health, he served on the Politburo and as Vice President. He suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in Havana, with Castro presiding over his burial ceremony.\n\n"}
{"id": "12616288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12616288", "title": "Early life of Augustus", "text": "Early life of Augustus\n\nThe early life of the Roman Emperor Augustus began at his birth in Rome on September 23, 63 BC, and is considered to have ended around the assassination of Dictator Julius Caesar, his great-uncle and adoptive father, on March 15, 44 BC.\n\nAugustus was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in Rome on September 23, 63 BC. He was a member of the respectable, but undistinguished, Octavii family through his father, also named Gaius Octavius, and was the great-nephew of Julius Caesar through his mother Atia Balba Caesonia. The young Octavius had two older siblings: a half sister, Octavia Major, from his father's first marriage, and a full sister, Octavia Minor. The Octavii were wealthy through their banking business in Velletri (in the Alban Hills), where the family was part of the local aristocracy. However, the family entered into the senatorial ranks with the elder Octavius as its novus homo. The elder Octavius' entrance into the Senate came when he was appointed Quaestor in 69 BC.\n\nIn 61 BC the elder Octavius was elected Praetor. Following his praetorship, he would serve for two years as governor of Macedonia. There, he proved himself a capable administrator. Upon returning to Italy in 59 BC, before he could stand for the Consulship, he suddenly died in Nola. This left the young Octavius, then four years old, without a father.\n\nOctavius' mother Atia took over his education in the absence of his father. He was taught as the average Roman aristocratic boy was, learning both Latin and Greek while being trained as an orator. When Octavius was six years old Atia remarried to Lucius Marcius Philippus, a supporter of Julius Caesar and a former governor of Syria. Philippus cherished his new stepchildren as if they were his own. He was consul of 56 BC with Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus.\n\nAt this time, the First Triumvirate between Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Marcus Licinius Crassus was starting to collapse. By the time Octavius was ten in 53 BC, the alliance completely broke down with the death of Crassus in Parthia. Soon thereafter, Octavius made his first public appearance in 52 BC when he delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother Julia Minor, sister of Caesar. It was at this time that the young Octavius captured the attention of his great-uncle.\n\nWith Crassus dead, Caesar and Pompey began to fight each other for supremacy and power. In 50 BC, the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Caesar to return to Rome from Gaul and to disband his army. The Senate had forbidden Caesar to stand for a second consulship in absentia. Without the consulship, Caesar would be without legal immunity and without the power of his army. Left with no other options, on January 10, 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon (the frontier boundary of Italy) with only one legion and ignited civil war.\n\nThe Senate and Pompey fled to Greece. Despite outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him, Pompey had no intention of fighting in Italy. Leaving Marcus Lepidus as prefect of Rome, and the rest of Italy under Mark Antony as tribune, Caesar made an astonishing 27-day route-march to Hispania, rejoining two of his Gallic legions, where he defeated Pompey's lieutenants. He then returned east, to challenge Pompey in Greece where, on July 10, 48 BC at the Battle of Dyrrhachium, Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat when the line of fortification was broken. He decisively defeated Pompey, despite Pompey's numerical advantage (nearly twice the number of infantry and considerably more cavalry), at the Battle of Pharsalus in an exceedingly short engagement in 48 BC.\n\nThe same year as Caesar’s ultimate victory against Pompey, Octavius turned 15 and donned the toga virillis on October 18. Shortly after assuming the toga virillis, Octavius began his first official business upon being elected a pontiff in the College of Pontiffs. It was Caesar who had nominated Octavius for this position, the first of many to come from Caesar. While it is unknown if Caesar took the time to explain the current military or political situation, Caesar did take an interest in Octavius. While celebrating the Festival of the Latins, Caesar appointed Octavius the Praefectus urbi until his return. While the position was solely honorary and possessed no authority, it allowed Octavius a place in the public eye.\n\nFrom 46 BC on, Octavius was very close to Caesar and attended theaters, banquets, and other social gatherings with him. In September 46 BC, when Caesar celebrated his multiple triumphs, Octavius took part in the procession and was accorded military honors despite never having served in combat. Soon, Octavius had built up considerable influence with Caesar to such a point that others would ask him to intercede with him on their behalf.\n\nFollowing in the normal path of young Romans, Octavius needed experience with military affairs. Caesar proposed that Octavius join him in Africa even though Octavius had fallen ill. Though he was now legally a man, his mother Atia was still a dominating figure in his life. According to Nicolaus of Damascus, Atia protested Octavius joining Caesar, and the latter recognized the necessity of protecting Octavius’ health. Though she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania, where he planned to fight the remaining forces under Pompey’s lieutenants, but Octavius again fell ill and was unable to travel.\n\nAs soon as he was well, Octavius, accompanied by a few friends (including Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa), sailed to Hispania. He became shipwrecked and, after coming ashore with his companions, was forced to make it across hostile territory to reach Caesar's camp. Octavius’ actions greatly impressed his great-uncle, who proceeded to teach Octavius the ways of provincial administration. Suetonius in Chapter 68 of his \"Life of Augustus\" writes that Lucius Antonius, the brother of Mark Antony, accused Augustus for having \"given himself to Aulus Hirtius in Spain for three hundred thousand sesterces.\" This alleged homosexual liaison must have taken place in 46 BC during the civil wars when Julius Caesar took Octavian to Spain and Aulus Hirtius was serving there. At the time the future Emperor Augustus was 17 years old.\nCaesar and Octavius stayed in Hispania until June 45 BC, after which they returned to Rome. Velleius Paterculus reports that Caesar and Octavius shared the same carriage. When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the Vestal Virgins in which he secretly named Octavius as the prime beneficiary. Upon returning to Rome, Caesar increasingly amassed more authority and control over the Roman state. He was made Consul for 10 years and Dictator for the same period. He was allowed to name half of the magistrates each year and even allowed to name new patricians. Among others, Caesar used this new power to elevate Octavius.\n\nHoping to continue Octavius’ education, at the end of 45 BC Caesar sent him, along with his friends Agrippa, Gaius Maecenas, and Quintus Salvidienus Rufus, to Apollonia in Macedonia. There, Octavius learned not only academics and self-control but military doctrine and tactics as well. Caesar, however, had more than just education in mind for Octavius. Macedonia was home of five legions and he hoped to use it as a launching ground for an upcoming war with Parthia in the Middle East. In preparation, Caesar had nominated Octavius to serve as Master of the Horse (Caesar’s chief lieutenant) for the year 43 BC, thus making Octavius the number-two man in the state at the age of 19.\n\nHowever, the war with the Parthians never came nor did Octavius’ promotion. While still in Apollonia, word reached Octavius that Caesar had been assassinated on the Ides of March in 44 BC. It was then made public that Caesar had adopted Octavius as his son and main heir. In response, Octavius changed his name to Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. Though modern scholars to avoid confusion commonly refer to him at this point as Octavian, he called himself \"Caesar\", which is the name his contemporaries also used. Rejecting the advice of some army officers to take refuge with his troops in Macedonia, Octavian sailed to Italy to claim his inheritance.\n\n"}

Acts of the Apostles calls him a magus, which the King James Bible here translates as \"sorcerer\". He is represented as opposing the disciple Paul the Apostle, who is called at this point for the first time with his Roman name, and Barnabas in the city of Paphos on Cyprus, when Sergius Paulus, the Roman Proconsul, wishes to hear Paul and Barnabas speak about Jesus. Because of this opposition, Paul claims that God had decided to make him temporarily blind. A cloud of darkness immediately begins blocking his sight; after this Sergius Paulus is converted to Christianity.\n\nElymas’s intentions for Sergius are unclear, only that he was desperate to keep him from receiving the word about Jesus. Perhaps he had the proconsul’s ear and was his advisor on matters of faith. This would make sense as Sergius is obviously learned about Jewish teachings and Elymas is Jewish. The message Paul and Barnabas bring threatens the false-prophet’s usefulness to the island's most powerful administrator.\n\nBar-Jesus received the same curse that Paul himself did: temporary blindness. It is clear from the passage that Bar-Jesus had the ear of the proconsul and was well known throughout the region. He was a self-proclaimed prophet of God who may have had his own religious agenda.\n\nActs 13:8 says \"Elymas the Magus (for so his name is translated) opposed them\". \"Elymas\" is possibly derived from the Arabic \"‘alīm\" \"learned\" or \"wise\", and may be used to translate \"magos\". \"Bar-Jesus\" means \"Son of Joshua\" or \"Son of Jesus\" in Aramaic.\n\n"}

He graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1939 with a BSc degree. He later received an MB, ChB, and MD from the University of Glasgow in 1942, 1942, and 1949, respectively; he also received a diploma in tropical medicine and hygiene from the University of Liverpool in 1948.\nStewart served as a surgeon-lieutenant in the Royal Navy from 1943 to 1946. He then held several hospital appointments, including senior registrar and tutor at the Wright-Fleming Institute at St Mary's Hospital, London from 1948 to 1952, where he worked alongside Alexander Fleming. He became professor of pathology and bacteriology at the University of Karachi in 1952. He served as a consultant pathologist to the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board of the National Health Service, as well as head of laboratories at the Medical Research Council Laboratories at Carshalton, from 1954 to 1963. He then traveled to the United States, where he served as Professor of Epidemiology and Pathology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill until 1968, and as Watkins Professor of Epidemiology at Tulane University Medical Center until 1972. From 1972 to 1984, he was the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the University of Glasgow.\nIn 1974, Stewart was part of a government-appointed team tasked with investigating experimental, now-banned whooping cough vaccines given by the British government to orphans and mentally handicapped children. In 1984, he was commissioned to write a report on the whooping cough vaccine by Britain's chief scientific officer, but the report was never made public by the then-British Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke.\nIn the 1970s, Stewart became well-known for his opposition to the pertussis vaccine, which he claimed to have supported until 1974, when he saw many vaccinated children who had still developed pertussis. By the mid-1970s, his criticisms of vaccines had attracted the attention of many parents who felt that their children had been injured by vaccines. With his support, the Association of Parents of Vaccine Damaged Children was formed in 1973. In 1977, he published a paper citing the cases of many of these children as proof that the DPT vaccine caused brain damage. In 1978, he claimed at a news conference that \"As with many other infectious diseases, there was a great decline in the rate of pertussis mortality before any vaccine was available.\" He also claimed that it was safer to get pertussis than to receive the vaccine. In 1977, Stewart criticized the British government's Committee on Safety of Medicines for calling for a pertussis vaccination campaign. He argued that \"There are no grounds for saying a major epidemic is on the way and I don't agree with the way their figures have been collected.\" In the next two years, however, over 100,000 children were hospitalized with pertussis, and 600 of them died. In the mid-1980s, Stewart served as the lead witness for the prosecution in the case of Johnnie Kinnear, whose mental development was allegedly stunted due to his receipt of the pertussis vaccine. The case unraveled after contradictions were revealed between Kinnear's parents' testimony and hospital records, and Stewart's role in the pertussis vaccine controversy came to an end as a result.\nStewart's public criticisms of vaccines contributed to a dramatic decrease in vaccination rates in the United Kingdom, and a resulting increase in cases of pertussis there. He later made an appearance in the 1982 WRC-TV news report \"Vaccine Roulette\", where his work was portrayed favorably. The host of the report, Lea Thompson, introduced Stewart as a member of the Committee on Safety of Medicines, despite the fact that he had never been a member of this group. Thompson also did not mention any of Stewart's previous associations with parents who believed their children had been injured by vaccines, nor did she note that his research had been used by some such parents as evidence in lawsuits.\n\nA former World Health Organization advisor on AIDS, Stewart was described as one of two HIV/AIDS \"dissidents to a degree\" by \"the Guardian\" in 2000 (the other being Andrew Herxheimer). Stewart and Herxheimer both served on Thabo Mbeki's presidential advisory panel on AIDS. In a 1990 \"Dispatches\" episode about HIV/AIDS, Stewart claimed that HIV had not spread significantly among heterosexuals in either the United States or Great Britain, dismissing the disease's spread in Africa as \"something else\". Epidemiologist Roy M. Anderson dismissed this claim, arguing that Stewart \"would benefit from becoming aware of the scientific literature\". In 1995, he argued against giving azidothymidine to pregnant women who had AIDS, even though it had already been shown to be effective at preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In 1997, he co-authored an article in \"Current Medical Research and Opinion\" along with several HIV/AIDS denialists, including Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos of the Perth Group. In 2000, he told \"the Guardian\": \"We have been criminally irresponsible - we have told people they have Aids when they are HIV positive and that's not true. We have told them there is no cure and no vaccine and they are going to die. We have caused endless stress and even suicide. Families have worried about whether their children are going to be infected. That's why it is such a panic disease. The medical establishment has made the panic.\" With respect to his views on the cause of AIDS, he was an outspoken supporter of Peter Duesberg's belief that it was not HIV, and argued that there was a conspiracy aimed at preventing such views from attracting public attention.\n"}

He was a member of the noble de Lannoy family.\nHis brothers were Hugo of Lannoy and Baldwin of Lannoy, also founding Knights of the Golden Fleece.\n\nGuillebert first served Jean de Werchin, seneschal of Hainaut, and accompanied him to the East and to Spain.

The hijackers were organized into four teams, each led by a pilot-trained hijacker with three or four \"muscle hijackers,\" who were trained to help subdue the pilots, passengers, and crew.\n\nThe first hijackers to arrive in the United States were Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who settled in San Diego County, California, in January 2000. They were followed by three hijacker-pilots, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah in mid-2000 to undertake flight training in South Florida. The fourth hijacker-pilot, Hani Hanjour, arrived in San Diego in December 2000. The rest of the \"muscle hijackers\" arrived in early- and mid-2001.\n\nKhalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi were both experienced and respected jihadists in the eyes of al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden.\n\nAs for the pilots who would go on to participate in the attacks, three of them were original members of the Hamburg cell (Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah). Following their training at Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, they were chosen by Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda's military wing due to their extensive knowledge of western culture and language skills, increasing the mission's operational security and its chances for success. The fourth intended pilot, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a member of the Hamburg cell, was also chosen to participate in the attacks yet was unable to obtain a visa for entry into the United States. He was later replaced by Hani Hanjour, a Saudi national.\n\nMihdhar and Hazmi were also potential pilot hijackers, but did not do well in their initial pilot lessons in San Diego. Both were kept on as \"muscle\" hijackers, who would help overpower the passengers and crew and allow the pilot hijackers to take control of the flights. In addition to Mihdhar and Hazmi, thirteen other muscle hijackers were selected in late 2000 or early 2001. All were from Saudi Arabia, with the exception of Fayez Banihammad, who was from the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBold letters note the hijackers who piloted the planes.\n\nHijackers: Mohamed Atta (Egyptian), Abdulaziz al-Omari (Saudi Arabian), Wail al-Shehri (Saudi Arabian), Waleed al-Shehri (Saudi Arabian), Satam al-Suqami (Saudi Arabian).\n\nTwo flight attendants called the American Airlines reservation desk during the hijacking. Betty Ong reported that \"the five hijackers had come from first-class seats: 2A, 2B, 9A, 9C and 9B.\" Flight attendant Amy Sweeney called a flight services manager at Logan Airport in Boston and described them as Middle Eastern. She gave the staff the seat numbers and they pulled up the ticket and credit card information of the hijackers, identifying Mohamed Atta.\n\nMohamed Atta's voice was heard over the air traffic control system, broadcasting messages thought to be intended for the passengers.\n\nHijackers: Marwan al-Shehhi (United Arab Emirates), Fayez Banihammad (United Arab Emirates), Mohand al-Shehri (Saudi Arabian), Hamza al-Ghamdi (Saudi Arabian), Ahmed al-Ghamdi (Saudi Arabian).\n\nA United Airlines mechanic was called by a flight attendant who stated the crew had been murdered and the plane hijacked.\n\nHijackers: Hani Hanjour (Saudi Arabian), Khalid al-Mihdhar (Saudi Arabian), Majed Moqed (Saudi Arabian), Nawaf al-Hazmi (Saudi Arabian), Salem al-Hazmi (Saudi Arabian).\n\nTwo hijackers, Hani Hanjour and Majed Moqed were identified by clerks as having bought single, first-class tickets for Flight 77 from Advance Travel Service in Totowa, New Jersey with $1,842.25 in cash. Renee May, a flight attendant on Flight 77, used a cell phone to call her mother in Las Vegas. She said her flight was being hijacked by six individuals who had moved them to the rear of the plane. Unlike the other flights, there was no report of stabbings or bomb threats. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, it is possible that pilots were not stabbed to death and were sent to the rear of the plane. One of the hijackers, most likely Hanjour, announced on the intercom that the flight had been hijacked.\nPassenger Barbara Olson called her husband, Theodore Olson, the Solicitor General of the United States, stating the flight had been hijacked and the hijackers had knives and box cutters. Two of the passengers had been on the FBI's terrorist-alert list: Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.\n\nHijackers: Ziad Jarrah (Lebanese), Ahmed al-Haznawi (Saudi Arabian), Ahmed al-Nami (Saudi Arabian), Saeed al-Ghamdi (Saudi Arabian).\n\nPassenger Jeremy Glick stated that the hijackers were Arabic-looking, wearing red headbands, and carrying knives.\n\nSpoken messages (from Ziad Jarrah) intended for passengers were broadcast over the air traffic control system, presumably by mistake:\n\nJarrah is also heard on the cockpit voice recorder. In addition, DNA samples submitted by his girlfriend were matched to remains recovered in Shanksville.\n\nBefore the attacks, FBI agent Robert Wright, Jr. had written vigorous criticisms of FBI's alleged incompetence in investigating terrorists residing within the United States. Wright was part of the Bureau's Chicago counter-terrorism task force and involved in project Vulgar Betrayal, which was linked to Yasin al-Qadi.\n\nAccording to James Bamford, the NSA had picked up communications of al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi back in 1999, but had been hampered by internal bureaucratic conflicts between itself and the CIA and did not do a full analysis of the information it passed on to the agency. For example, it only passed on the first names, Nawaf and Khalid.\n\nBamford also claims that the CIA's Alec Station (a unit assigned to bin Laden) knew that al-Mihdhar was planning to come to New York as far back as January 2000. Doug Miller, one of three FBI agents working inside the CIA station, tried to send a message (a CIR) to the FBI to alert them about this, so they could put al-Mihdhar on a watch list. His CIA boss, Tom Wilshire, deputy station chief, allegedly denied permission to Miller. Miller asked his associate Mark Rossini for advice; Rossini pressed Wilshire's deputy but was rebuffed also.\n\nBamford also claims that al-Mihdhar and Hazmi wound up living with Abdussattar Shaikh for a time to save money. Shaikh was, coincidentally, an FBI informant, but since they never acted suspiciously around him, he never reported them. The CIA Bangkok station told Alec Station that Hazmi had gone to Los Angeles. None of this information made it back to the FBI headquarters.\n\nWithin minutes of the attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened the largest FBI investigation in United States history, operation PENTTBOM. The suspects were identified within 72 hours because few made any attempt to disguise their names on flight and credit card records. They were also among the few non-U.S. citizens and nearly the only passengers with Arabic names on their flights, enabling the FBI to identify them using such details as dates of birth, known or possible residences, visa status, and specific identification of the suspected pilots. On September 27, 2001, the FBI released photos of the 19 hijackers, along with information about many of their possible nationalities and aliases. The suspected hijackers were from Saudi Arabia (fifteen hijackers), United Arab Emirates (two hijackers), Lebanon (one hijacker) and Egypt (one hijacker).\n\nThe passport of Satam al-Suqami was reportedly recovered \"a few blocks from where the World Trade Center's twin towers once stood\"; a passerby picked it up and gave it to a NYPD detective shortly before the towers collapsed. The passports of two other hijackers, Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi, were recovered from the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, and a fourth passport, that of Abdulaziz al-Omari was recovered from luggage that did not make it onto American Airlines Flight 11.\n\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission Report, 26 al-Qaeda terrorist conspirators sought to enter the United States to carry out a suicide mission. In the end, the FBI reported that there were 19 hijackers in all: five on three of the flights, and four on the fourth. On September 14, three days after the attacks, the FBI announced the names of 19 persons. After a controversy about an earlier remark, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano stated in May 2009 that the 9/11 Commission found that none of the hijackers entered the United States through Canada.\n\nNawaf al-Hazmi and Hani Hanjour, attended the Dar al-Hijrah Falls Church, Virginia, Islamic Center where the Imam Anwar al-Awlaki preached, in early April 2001. Through interviews with the FBI, it was discovered that Awlaki had previously met Nawaf al-Hazmi several times while the two lived in San Diego. At the time, Hazmi was living with Khalid al-Mihdhar, another 9/11 hijacker. The hijackers of the same plane often had very strong ties as many of them attended school together or lived together prior to the attacks\n\nSoon after the attacks and before the FBI had released the pictures of all the hijackers, several reports claimed some of the men named as hijackers on 9/11 were alive and had their identities stolen.\n\n\n\n"}

The main significance of the story is the key part that the escape played in forming the character and the opinions of Charles.\n\nJane was the daughter of Thomas Lane and Anne Bagot of the parish of Bentley and Hyde (near Walsall). Her parents had married at Blithfield, Staffordshire, in 1608. Their son, John, was born on April 8, 1609, the first child of what was to be four sons and five daughters. There are several early christening dates for a Jane Lane in the International Genealogical Index which have been estimated by contributors, most probably based on a spurious date for her marriage. However she was known as Jane Lane in 1651 and so was unmarried at that date. Her eventual marriage to Sir Clement Fisher (of Packington Hall, Warwickshire) is known to have occurred on December 8, 1663, being performed by the Most Rev. Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nKnown birth (and other) dates for Jane Lane's siblings are:\n\n\nFollowing defeat at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, Charles II escaped and headed north into Shropshire and Staffordshire with several companions including Lord Derby and Henry, Lord Wilmot. A reward of £1000 was offered for the capture of the King. It is likely that the King and anyone helping him would have been executed for treason, if caught. The King had a distinctive appearance: very dark and six feet two inches tall (1.88 m). Furthermore, there were cavalry patrols specifically tasked with finding the King. At this time it was illegal for Catholics to travel more than five miles away from their homes without a pass from the Sheriff of the County. Helping the King would therefore be hazardous.\n\nWilmot had gone to Bentley Hall, the home of Colonel John Lane, who had been an officer in the Royalist Army since 1642. His sister was Jane Lane. She was described by John Evelyn as \"an acute wit\", \"an excellent disputant\" though \"no beauty\". Wilmot learned that Jane had obtained a permit from the military for herself and a servant to travel to the seaport of Bristol, to visit a relation, Ellen Norton, who was having a baby. Lord Wilmot saw the opportunity of escaping through Bristol in the guise of the servant, since no lady would travel alone. On learning of the King's failure to reach Wales, Wilmot decided that the King should take advantage of the military pass and travel to Bristol as Jane Lane's servant, and then find a ship to take him to France.\n\nWhen the King reached Bentley Hall early on 10 September 1651, he was quickly dressed as a tenant farmer’s son and adopted the alias ‘William Jackson’ for the next part of his journey. The party then set out, Charles riding the same horse as Jane Lane. They were accompanied by Withy Petre (Jane Lane’s sister), her husband John Petre, and Henry Lascelles, another related Royalist officer.\n\nLord Wilmot refused to travel in disguise; he rode openly half a mile ahead of the party and if challenged he said he would claim to be out hunting. This was a risky yet useful decoy. The party rode through Rowley Regis then Quinton to Bromsgrove. When they arrived at Bromsgrove they found that the horse ridden by Charles and Jane had lost a shoe. The King, playing the role of servant, took the horse to a blacksmith. \n\nThe King when he later told his story to Samuel Pepys and others said, \nThe party reached Wootton Wawen where cavalry had gathered outside the inn. Here John and Withy Petre went ahead of the party. The King, Jane and Henry Lascelles with great coolness rode through the troops. The party then continued through Stratford-upon-Avon, and on to Long Marston where they spent the night of 10 September at the house of John Tomes, another relation of Jane's. \n\nOn Thursday 11 September, they continued through Chipping Campden and then to Cirencester, where it is said they spent the night of 11 September at the Crown Inn. The next morning they travelled on to Chipping Sodbury and then to Bristol, arriving at Abbots Leigh on the evening of 12 September. They stayed at the home of Mr and Mrs George Norton, who were also Jane’s friends. The Nortons were unaware of the King's identity during his three-day stay at Abbotsleigh. While staying there Charles deflected suspicion by asking a servant, who had been in the King's personal guard at the Battle of Worcester, to describe the King's appearance and clothing at the battle. The man looked at Charles and said, \"The King was at least three fingers taller than [you].\"\nAttempts were made to find a ship from Bristol to France but without success. \nCharles and Wilmot therefore decided to try the south coast. \nEllen Norton had a miscarriage and felt that Jane should stay. Consequently, Jane had to counterfeit a letter apparently calling her back to Bentley so that she could leave with the King. \nOn the morning of 16 September Charles and Jane set out and reached the Manor House, Castle Cary. \nThe next day they reached Trent in Dorset. They stayed at Trent House, the home of Colonel Francis Wyndham, another Royalist officer. The King spent the next few days hiding at Trent whilst Wyndham and Wilmot attempted to find a ship from Lyme Regis or Weymouth. It was whilst he was at Trent that the King witnessed a bizarre event where the local villagers were celebrating, believing that he had been killed at Worcester. It was also this point that Jane Lane and Lascelles returned home.\n\nHowever Jane heard on 14 October that the Council of State had been told she had helped with the escape. Before Bentley Hall was searched, she left, walking to Yarmouth posing as a \"country wench\" and travelled to France. She arrived in Paris in December 1651 and was welcomed by the Court in exile. She developed a strong friendship with the King and with Queen Henrietta Maria. The King held her in great esteem. So much so that John Fisher reported a scurrillous rumour had circulated that she was the King's mistress. Even the King's sister, Mary, in a letter from Holland jokingly referred to Jane as the King's 'wife'.\n\nIn 1652, Charles arranged for Jane to become a lady-in-waiting for his sister Princess Mary in Holland. Throughout his exile Charles carried on affectionate correspondence with Jane Lane and often said that he wished he could help her more. Jane received the following letter from Charles in reply to a letter in which Jane had said he had probably forgotten her by now: \n\nOnly when the Restoration finally came did Jane return to England. Charles was then able to give her a pension of £1000 per year and many gifts, including portraits of the King and a lock of his hair. Parliament also voted her £1000 to buy a jewel to commemorate her service. Her courageous loyalty earned for her family the right to add the three Lions of England to their coat of arms. (In later years the lions exempted the Lane family from a tax on coats of arms, as the royal arms were exempt.) \n\nShe was married to Sir Clement Fisher, 2nd Baronet of Great Packington (1613–1683), on 8 December 1663 by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Fisher had served under Jane's brother, John Lane, as a captain in the First Civil War. There were no children from the marriage.\n\nIn later life she lived extravagantly and there were arrears of £6500 in the payment of her pension. Consequently, she was deeply in debt. Lady Fisher died at Packington Old Hall, between Birmingham and Coventry, on 9 September 1689 and was buried at Packington. Because of her debts, her estate was only £10.\n\nSeveral paintings of Jane exist including one in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery of the King and Jane Lane on a horse (NPG 5251). It was part of a romanticised series about the escape painted by Isaac Fuller shortly after the Restoration.\n\n\n"}

Most of what is known about him is based on oral tradition and legends. Legend tells that he slept with his feet out of the window of his small house. Tales also credit him with great strength.\n\nJohn Middleton was born in the village of Hale, near Liverpool. According to contemporary accounts and his epitaph, Middleton grew to the height of .\nAlso he slept with his feet hanging out the window of his house.\nBecause of his size, landlord and sheriff of Lancashire Gilbert Ireland hired him as a bodyguard. When King James I stopped by in 1617 to knight Ireland, he also heard about Middleton and invited both of them to the court, which they accepted in 1620.\n\nIn London, John Middleton was presented to the King in a costume of large lace ruffs about his face and hands; a striped doublet of crimson and white; a blue girdle embroidered with gold; large plush white breeches with powdered blue flowers; green stockings; broad shoes in a light colour, having high red heels and tied with large bows of red ribbon and just below his knees were bandages of the same colour with large bows and by his side a sword was suspended by a broad belt over his shoulder. Brasenose College has a portrait of Middleton in this dress and the painted outline of his hand. Middleton beat the King's champion in wrestling and in doing so broke the man's thumb. He received £20, a large amount of money in those times. Unfortunately, jealous of his wealth, Middleton's companions mugged him when he was returning to Hale. His money was stolen.\n\nJohn Middleton died impoverished in 1623. He was buried in the Hale churchyard with an epitaph, \"Here lyeth the bodie of John Middleton the Childe of Hale. Nine feet three. Borne 1578 Dyed 1623.\"\n\nThere have been numerous local uses and commemorations of Middleton; a pub in Hale, named \"The Childe of Hale\", bears a copy of the Brasenose College portrait as its sign. Previously situated across the road from the church was a large tree trunk. In 1996 it was carved with representations of John Middleton, Hale Lighthouse and other local symbols. In 2011, due to disease and in the interests of public safety the tree trunk was removed by Halton Borough Council. In April 2013, the wooden sculpture was replaced by a bronze statue 3 m tall by local sculptor, Diane Gorvin.\n\n"}

In several studies this was taken into account, and for the first time horses did show social learning.

She has been canonized a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nBorn to an aristocratic family in 1891 in Riga, Latvia, then part of the Russian Empire. She was given the name Elizaveta Pilenko. Her father died when she was a teenager, and she embraced atheism. In 1906 her mother moved the family to St. Petersburg, where she became involved in radical intellectual circles. In 1910 she married a Bolshevik by the name of Dmitriy Kuz'min-Karavaev. During this period of her life she was actively involved in literary circles and wrote much poetry. Her first book, Scythian Shards (Скифские черепки), was a collection of poetry from this period. By 1913 her marriage to Dimitriy had ended and the latter subsequently became Eastern Orthodox.\n\nThrough a look at the humanity of Christ — \"He also died. He sweated blood. They struck his face\" — she began to be drawn back into Christianity. She moved—now with her daughter, Gaiana—to the south of Russia where her religious devotion increased.\n\nFurious at Leon Trotsky for closing the Socialist-Revolutionary Party Congress, she planned his assassination, but was dissuaded by colleagues, who sent her to Anapa.\nIn 1918, after the Bolshevik Revolution, she was elected deputy mayor of Anapa in Southern Russia. When the anti-communist White Army took control of Anapa, the mayor fled and she became mayor of the town. The White Army put her on trial for being a Bolshevik. However, the judge was a former teacher of hers, Daniel Skobtsov, and she was acquitted. Soon the two fell in love and were married.\n\nSoon, the political tide was turning again. In order to avoid danger, Elizaveta, Daniel, Gaiana, and Elizaveta's mother Sophia fled the country. Elizaveta was pregnant with her second child. They traveled first to Georgia (where her son Yuri was born) and then to Yugoslavia (where her daughter Anastasia was born). Finally they arrived in Paris in 1923. Soon Elizaveta was dedicating herself to theological studies and social work.\n\nIn 1926, Anastasia died of influenza. Gaiana was sent away to Belgium to boarding school. Soon, Daniel and Elizaveta's marriage was falling apart. Yuri ended up living with Daniel, and Elizaveta moved into central Paris to work more directly with those who were most in need.\n\nHer bishop encouraged her to take vows as a nun, something she did only with the assurance that she would not have to live in a monastery, secluded from the world. In 1932, with Daniel Skobtov's permission, an ecclesiastical divorce was granted and she took monastic vows. In religion she took the name Maria. Her confessor was Father Sergei Bulgakov. Later, Fr. Dmitri Klepinin would be sent to be the chaplain of the house.\n\nMother Maria made a rented house in Paris her \"convent\". It was a place with an open door for refugees, the needy and the lonely. It also soon became a center for intellectual and theological discussion. In Mother Maria these two elements—service to the poor and theology—went hand-in-hand.\n\nAfter the Fall of France in 1940, Jews began approaching the house asking for baptismal certificates, which Father Dimitri would provide them. Many Jews came to stay with them. They provided shelter and helped many to flee the country. Eventually the house was closed down. Mother Maria, Fr. Dimitri, Yuri and Sophia were all arrested by the Gestapo. Fr. Dimitri and Yuri both died at the Dora concentration camp.\n\nMother Maria was sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp. On Holy Saturday, 1945, she failed a selection and was sent to the Gas Chamber.\n\nMother Maria was glorified (canonized a saint) by act of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 16 January 2004. The glorification of Mother Maria, together with Fr. Dimitri, Yuri, and Ilya Fondaminsky took place at the Cathedral of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Paris on 1 and 2 May 2004. Their feast day is 20 July.\nHer life is dramatized in a Soviet film starring Lyudmila Kasatkina.\n\nAccording to Metropolitan Anthony (Bloom) of Sourozh:\n\"Mother Maria is a saint of our day and for our day; a woman of flesh and blood possessed by the love of God, who stood face to face with the problems of this century.\"\n\nIn July, 1942, when the order requiring Jews to wear the yellow star was published, she wrote a poem entitled \"Israel\":\n\n\n\n"}

A member of one of England's most prominent artistic and literary families, her unconventional political trajectory began with anarchism, continued with the League of Nations, and ended with Italian fascism. Her involvement with the latter led to an important correspondence and friendship with Ezra Pound, who mentions her twice in his \"Cantos\".\n\nOlivia Rossetti Agresti was born in London to William Michael Rossetti, one of the seven founding members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the editor of its literary magazine \"The Germ\". A granddaughter of Gabriele Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown, she was hence a niece of Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti, as well as a first cousin of Ford Madox Ford.\n\nWhile still in their girlhood, Olivia and her sister, the future Helen Rossetti Angeli (1879-1969), began publishing an anarchist journal, \"The Torch\", in the basement of their family home. Despite their youth, this effort became the nucleus of a prominent anarchist salon which included Peter Kropotkin and Sergei Kravchinski, and their publishing coups included the pamphlet \"Why I Am an Anarchist\" by George Bernard Shaw. Years later, using the pseudonym \"Isabel Meredith\", Olivia and Helen published \"A Girl Among the Anarchists\", a somewhat fictionalized memoir of their days as precocious child revolutionaries. These adventures were also chronicled by their cousin Ford Madox Ford in his 1931 memoir \"Return to Yesterday\".\n\nA more permanent consequence of this political activity was Olivia's marriage in 1897 to the Italian anarchist and journalist Antonio Agresti (1866-1926), which led to her emigration from England to Italy. Olivia was to remain there for the rest of her life and she eventually became an Italian citizen. During her first years in Italy she continued with literary activities related to her political activism, including a biography of the Italian painter and revolutionary Giovanni Costa.\n\nThe second phase in Agresti's career began in 1904, when she met the American agricultural reformer David Lubin. A former department store and mail order magnate from Sacramento, Lubin was in Rome seeking a state sponsor for his idea of an international clearinghouse for agricultural statistics. Unable to speak Italian, Lubin hired Agresti as his interpreter and thus began a close collaboration between the two which continued until Lubin's death.\n\nWith Agresti's assistance, Lubin's efforts in Italy made history. After gaining the unexpected support of Italy's king Victor Emmanuel III, Lubin's vision became a reality with the 1905 founding of the International Institute of Agriculture, headquartered in Rome. The first modern international organization, it was hailed as a significant forerunner of world government by such luminaries as H. G. Wells and Louis Brandeis. Agresti includes samples of Lubin's correspondence with Wells and Brandeis in her 1922 biography \"David Lubin: A Study in Practical Idealism\".\n\nFollowing Lubin's death in 1919, Agresti waged a public campaign for close cooperation between the International Institute of Agriculture and the nascent League of Nations, which soon employed her as a member of the staff to Italy's delegation. She continued as a staff interpreter for the League in Geneva from 1922 to 1930. Her last assignment as a professional interpreter occurred in 1945 when, at the personal request of Italy's prime minister, Alcide De Gasperi, she accompanied him to London for meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers. According to her unpublished memoirs, meetings at which Agresti interpreted included Ernest Bevin and Vyacheslav Molotov.\n\nBy 1921 Agresti's early anarchist leanings, further leavened by years of exposure to Lubin's theories concerning cooperative organization of society, had transformed her into an enthusiastic supporter of corporatism and, consequently, of Benito Mussolini's corporatist reorganization of the Italian economy. From 1921 to 1943 she edited the newsletter of the \"Associazione fra le Società per Azioni\", a group then closely allied with the Fascists, and in 1938 co-authored the theoretical work \"The Organization of the Arts and Professions in the Fascist Guild State\" with the Fascist journalist .\n\nIn 1937, Agresti's editorship of economic journals brought her into professional contact with Ezra Pound, then residing in Italy and writing articles in Italian on economic topics. Thus began a long correspondence between the two which lasted until 1959, the year before Agresti's death. Agresti seems to have been unaware of Pound's fame as a poet, and Pound unaware of Agresti's family ties to Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Ford Madox Ford, two of the most important influences on his poetry, until years into the correspondence. Portions of this correspondence were edited and published in 1998 by the University of Illinois Press.\n\nAgresti became practically a member of Pound's extended family as the years progressed, and she and her two adopted Italian daughters were frequent guests at Schloss Brunnenburg. She was active for years in the international campaign to free Pound from his involuntary incarceration in a mental asylum by the government of the United States, and Pound in turn tried to assist her, then suffering from an impecunious old age, by finding a publisher for her memoirs. Pound refers to Agresti twice in his \"Cantos\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867044", "title": "Orville E. Babcock", "text": "Orville E. Babcock\n\nOrville Elias Babcock (December 25, 1835 – June 2, 1884) was an engineer, and American Civil War general in the Union Army. An aide to General Ulysses S. Grant during and after the war, he was President Grant's private secretary at the White House, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds for Washington D.C., and a Florida-based federal inspector of lighthouses. Babcock continued to serve as lighthouse inspector under Grant's successors Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, and Chester A Arthur. \n\nA native of Vermont, Babcock graduated third in his class at West Point in 1861, and served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers throughout the Civil War. As Assistant Engineer and aide-de-camp for district commander Nathaniel P. Banks, in 1862 Babcock worked on fortifications to aid in defending the nation's capitol from Confederate attack. Babcock later served as aide-de-camp for Ulysses S. Grant and participated in the Overland Campaign. He was promoted to brevet brigadier general in 1865 and continued on Grant's staff during Reconstruction. In 1867, Babcock warned Grant of a white supremacist insurgency that used Confederate symbolism to intimidate blacks in the South. \n\nAfter Grant became President in 1869, Babcock was assigned Grant's Secretary to the President of the United States—in modern terms, the chief of staff—and he served until his departure from the White House in 1876. Babcock's salary was paid by the U.S. Army and he was not subject to Congressional approval. Grant also appointed Babcock Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds for Washington, DC. Babcock, at the time, was young and ambitious, and considered the Iago of the Grant administration. In 1869, Grant sent Babcock on a mission to explore the possibility of annexing the island nation of Santo Domingo to the United States, but the Senate led by Charles Sumner rejected the proposal. \n\nBabcock's tenure under President Grant was embroiled in corruption charges, and his manipulation of both cabinet departments and appointments. Grant supported Babcock when Babcock was accused of corruption; Grant's shielding of Babcock from political attack stemmed primarily from their shared experiences on the battlefield during the American Civil War. When Babcock was indicted as a member of the Whiskey Ring in 1875, Grant believed it was an indictment on his presidency. He provided a written deposition on Babcock's behalf—a first for a sitting president—which was admitted at Babcock's 1876 trial and resulted in his acquittal. The news coverage of the Whiskey Ring and other Grant administration scandals caused public opinion to turn against Babcock. Upon his return from St. Louis, Babcock was reluctant to leave his post, as if nothing happened, but under pressure from Secretary Fish, Grant forced Babcock to leave the White House. \n\nPresident Grant would not desert his wartime comrade; in February 1877, he appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Federal Lighthouse Board's Fifth District, a low-profile post that did not attract undue public attention. In 1882, President Chester A. Arthur additionally appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Federal Lighthouse Board's Sixth District. Babcock was the chief engineer overseeing plans for the construction of Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse. He died in 1884 on duty when he drowned off Mosquito Inlet in Daytona Beach, Florida. Babcock's historical reputation is mixed; his technical engineering expertise, efficiency, bravery in battle, and Union loyalty were offset by his involvement in corruption, deception, and scandal. Uncommon for his times, Babcock showed no racism in relations with African Americans or mixed race peoples, which was a key factor in Grant's decision to send Babcock to Santo Domingo, whose population was predominantly mixed race, and consisted of individuals with American Indian, African, and Hispanic ancestry.\n\nOrville E. Babcock was born on December 25, 1835 in Franklin, Vermont, a small town located near the Canada–US border close to Lake Champlain. Babcock's father was Elias Babcock Jr. and his mother was Clara Olmsted. While growing up in Vermont he received a common education. At the age of 16, Babcock was appointed to the West Point Military Academy (USMA), where he graduated third in a class of 45 on May 6, 1861. His high class ranking enabled Babcock to select his branch, and he chose the Engineers, as did most top graduates of his era.\n\nThe American Civil War was beginning as Babcock was graduating; he was commissioned as a Brevet Second Lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, and assigned to duty as an Assistant Engineer for the military district that included Washington. His first mission was the undertaking of efforts to improve the defensive works of Washington, D.C. and protect the city from attack. On July 13, 1861, Babcock was assigned to the Department of Pennsylvania. In August, he received his commission as a second lieutenant, to date from his West Point graduation in May; he was assigned to the Department of the Shenandoah, and constructed military fortifications on the Potomac River and in the Shenandoah Valley while also serving as aide-de-camp under Major General Nathaniel P. Banks. From August through November, Babcock worked again on improving the fortifications surrounding Washington, responding to increased apprehension the Union capital was vulnerable to attack and capture by the Confederate Army.\n\nOn November 17, 1861, Babcock was promoted to First Lieutenant, Corps of Engineers, and a week later was assigned to the Army of the Potomac. During the months of February and March, 1862, while General Banks moved to Winchester, Virginia, Babcock set up military fortifications at Harper's Ferry and guarded pontoon bridges crossing the Potomac River. During the Peninsular Campaign, Babcock served bravely at the Siege of Yorktown with the Army of the Potomac's Engineer Battalion and was breveted as a captain to rank from May 4, 1862. For the next seven months, Babcock built bridges, roads, and field works. For his service, in November, 1862, Babcock was promoted to Chief Engineer Left Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac.\n\nIn December 1862, during the Battle of Fredericksburg, Babcock served on Brigadier General William B. Franklin's engineering staff.\n\nOn January 1, 1863, Babcock was promoted to permanent captain and brevet lieutenant colonel, and was named the Assistant Inspector General of the VI Corps until February 6, when he was named the Assistant Inspector General and Chief Engineer of the IX Corps. As Chief Engineer of the IX Corps, Babcock surveyed and projected the defensive fortifications at Louisville and Central Kentucky. Moving westward to help secure the Mississippi River from Confederate control and divide the Confederacy in two, Babcock fought with the IX Corps at the Battle of Vicksburg and the Battle of Blue Springs, and the Battle of Campbell's Station.\n\nBabcock was part of XXIII Corps, and served under Union engineer Captain Orlando M. Poe. Poe and Union engineers, that included Babcock, built several fortifications in the form of bastioned earthworks near Knoxville. One was Fort Sanders, just west of downtown Knoxville across a creek valley. It was named for Brig. Gen. William P. Sanders, mortally wounded in a skirmish outside Knoxville on November 18, 1863. The fort, had an innovative design, and was a salient in the line of earthworks that surrounded three sides of the city, rose above the surrounding plateau and was protected by a ditch wide and deep. An almost insurmountable vertical wall rose above the ditch, slippery and frozen. Inside the fort were 12 cannons and 440 men of the 79th New York Infantry. In front of the ditch, telegraph wires were strung at knee height across tree stumps, possibly the first use of such wire entanglements in the Civil War, to entangle Confederate soldiers that would assault the Fort.\n\nThe Battle of Fort Sanders was brutal by 19th Century standards. The Confederates moved to within 120-150 yards of the salient during the night of freezing rain and snow and waited for the order to attack. Entangled by the telegraph wire, Confederate soldiers were shot by Union soldiers atop the wall. After crossing the ditch, the Confederates were unable to dig footholds, men climbed upon each other's shoulders to attempt to reach the top of the wall. Union soldiers rained fire into the assault, including musketry, canister, and artillery shells thrown as hand grenades. A succession of color bearers was shot down as they planted their flags on the fort. For a brief time, three flags reached the top, those of the 16th Georgia, 13th Mississippi, and 17th Mississippi. After 40 minutes of battle, the Confederates broke and retreated. The battle ended in a lopsided Union victory.\n\nAfter fighting in the Knoxville Campaign, at the Battle of Fort Sanders, Babcock became the Chief Engineer of the Department of the Ohio and was promoted to brevet major on November 29, 1863.\n\nBabcock was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the regular army on March 29, 1864 and became the aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant participating in Overland Campaign against General Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Babcock served in the Battle of the Wilderness, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and the Battle of Cold Harbor.\n\nFor his gallant service at the Battle of the Wilderness, Babcock was appointed brevet lieutenant colonel, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from May 6, 1864. On August 9, 1864, Babcock, while stationed at Union headquarters in City Point, was wounded in the hand after Confederate spies had blown up an ammunition barge moored below the city's bluffs. As Grant's aide-de-camp, Babcock ran dispatches between Grant and Major General William T. Sherman during Sherman's March to the Sea campaign.\n\nOn April 9, 1865 after being defeated at the Battle of Appomattox, Commanding Confederate General Robert E. Lee formally surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to Ulysses S. Grant. Babcock personally chose the site of surrender at the McLean House, personally escorted Lee to the meeting, and witnessed Grant and Lee discussing and signing the surrender terms.\n\nFor his meritorious contributions in the Civil War, Babcock was appointed brevet colonel, to rank from March 13, 1865. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Babcock for brevet brigadier general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.\n\nAfter the War, Babcock remained on Grant's staff throughout America's turbulent Reconstruction Period. On July 25, 1866, Brig. Gen. Babcock was commissioned Colonel of Staff and aide-de-camp for General-in-Chief of the Army, Ulysses S. Grant. On March 21, 1867 Babcock received a Regular Army commission as a major in the Corps of Engineers.\n\nOn November 6, 1866, Babcock married Anne Eliza Cambell in Galena, Illinois. Their marriage produced four children: Campbell E. Babcock, Orville E. Babcock, Jr., Adolph B. Babcock, and Benjamin Babcock. Benjamin died during infancy. Babcock moved to Washington D.C. to serve under Grant while Grant was Commanding General and President of the United States.\n\nIn mid-April Commanding General Grant dispatched Babcock and Horace Porter, another member of Grant's staff, to report on the progress of Southern Reconstruction. Babcock and Porter were optimistic on the plight of blacks who had embraced citizenship saying the \"negro is learning very fast. They will soon be the best educated \"class\" in the South, if they continue at their present rate of progress.\" However, Babcock discovered and informed Grant of a white supremacist insurgency and Confederate symbolism were developing that intimidated African Americans, saying that in Georgia the \"police in most of the cities are in a grey uniform, the real \"confederate\" uniform.\"\n\nIn 1868, Ulysses S. Grant was elected the 18th President of the United States. In 1869, General Babcock was assigned Grant's military private secretary. Babcock worked directly for President Grant. Babcock, one of a few men who had daily access to President Grant at the White House, had unprecedented influence over President Grant and planted suspicions in Grant that enemies were out to politically destroy his administration. His influence even extended indirectly into many cabinet departments and he was at odds with reformers, that included Secretary Fish and Secretary Bristow, who both had desired to save Grant's reputation from scandal. When cabinet appointments came available, Grant listened to Babcock's recommendations. Babcock, who was admired by Grant for his Civil War service, was young and ambitious and considered the Iago of the Grant administration.\n\nBabcock was 33 years old at the time of Grant's inauguration. He retained his position in the U.S. Army under Sherman, who under special arrangement with Grant was allowed to be the President's personal secretary. Babcock did not require Senate confirmation for his appointment, while he retained his military salary. Babcock's duties included involvement in patronage matters, finding dirt on Grant's administration critics, and feeding political stories to pro-Grant newspapers. \n\nBabcock's office was in an anteroom on the second floor of the White House that led to President Grant's private office. In order to see Grant, visitors had to go through Babcock, a circumstance that caused many to resent Babcock's insider role, and created a negative perception among contemporaries that overrode Babcock's positive attributes. Babcock also opened and answered most of Grant's personal letters, and historian Allan Nevins argued that Babcock's position was as at least as important as the Cabinet secretaries, and more powerful than most.\n\nAfter his appointment, in 1869, Babcock was involved as a special agent of President Ulysses S. Grant in the attempt to annex the mostly black Caribbean island country of the Dominican Republic (\"18,655 mi²\"), then commonly called \"Santo Domingo\". At this time, federal land speculation was not uncommon, as Congress had in March 1867, purchased Alaska (\"663,300 mi²\") from the Russian Empire. Like his predecessor, Andrew Johnson, Grant received inducements for Caribbean expansion particularly for Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Speculators William L. Cazneau and Joseph W. Fabens formed the \"Santo Domingo Company\" in New York to gain investment backers for the annexation of the Dominican Republic. Grant's Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, was doubtful concerning Haitian annexation, believing the country to unstable, but he was initially more favorable to annexing the Dominican Republic after realizing investors were highly enthusiastic towards investing in the country. Fish, however, became suspicious of annexation when Fabens, representing promoters, approached Fish and asked him to support a plan of American annexation of the Dominican Republic. Grant, who was more favorable to wealthy business leaders and investors, supported annexation. Fish, supporting Grant out of loyalty, agreed to send Babcock on a reconnaissance mission, Grant's appointed special agent to the Dominican Republic. \n\nBabcock was accompanied by Fabens and annexation supporter California Republican Senator Cornelius Cole. Cazneau, who was on the island, formerly introduced the young and ambitious Babcock to the Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez, and the two unknown to Fish, made a draft of annexation. According to the annexation draft made in September 1869, Samaná Bay would be sold to the United States for $2 million or the country would be annexed to the United States after paying of the Dominican Republic's national debt of $1.5 million. Babcock was a supporter of Congressional Reconstruction, and he saw Santo Domingo, not as a nation of blacks, but as a source of new opportunities in a post war world. \n\nWhen Babcock returned to the White House having a treaty, Fish and Secretary of Interior Jacob D. Cox were alarmed, since Babcock had no official standing. Fish told Cox, \"Babcock is back...I pledge you my word he had no more diplomatic authority than any other casual visitor to the island.\" At the next cabinet meeting Babcock was there in person and Grant told his silenced cabinet that Babcock was back and that he approved of the treaty, while it only needed a signature from the U.S. consular in Santo Domingo. Cox spoke up and said, \" But Mr. President, has it been settled, then, that we \"want\" to annex Santo Domingo ?\" Grant was embarrassed and began puffing on his cigar, while the other cabinet members said nothing, Cox's question remained unanswered. Fish threatened to resign over the matter, but Grant convinced him to stay on the administration telling Fish he would not go around him again and he needed Fish's guidance and support. Fish agreed to remain on the cabinet, although he hoped Grant would drop the Santo Domingo annexation treaty.\n\nGrant, however, did not drop the treaty, having believed annexation would help alleviate violent suppression of African Americans in the Southern states, as blacks would have a safe environment to work and live, in the Dominican Republic. Fish sent Babcock back to the Dominican Republic on November 18, accompanied by Quartermaster Rufus Ingalls, this time having official State Department status and instructions to draw up two formal treaties, signed on November 29, 1869. Grant, however, kept the treaties secret from Congress and the public, until mid-January 1870. After earnest public discussion, the treaties was formerly submitted to Congress in March, whereupon Senators joined in the debate. Senator Charles Sumner strongly opposed the annexation treaties objecting to Babcock's secret negotiations, his use of naval power, and desiring to keep Santo Domingo an autonomous African American nation rather than annexation and potential statehood as Grant had proposed. The people of Santo Domingo overwhelmingly desired annexation voting 15,169 to 11 in its favor, according to a plebiscite held by Báez. Senate Republicans led by Sumner split the party over the treaty while Senators loyal to Grant supported the treaty and admonished Babcock. The treaties however failed to pass the Senate causing continued bitterness and hostility between Grant and Sumner, both stubbornly trying to control the Republican Party. Although Babcock was suspected of being given investment land on Samaná Bay, a Congressional investigation found no conclusive evidence that Babcock would financially gain from the country's annexation. Babcock in the minority report was criticized for acquiescing in the imprisonment of Davis Hatch, an American abroad, who was an open critic of Báez.\n\nIn 1869, Babcock invested money in the Jay Cooke & Company's Gold Ring, a scam by wealthy New York tycoons Jay Gould and James Fisk to profit by cornering the market on gold. Starting in late April, Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell had regulated the price of gold by monthly sales from the Treasury in exchange for greenbacks. As part of the Gold Ring's effort, Gould convinced Grant not to increase the Treasury's September gold sale, helping make it scarce and inflating the price. Gould and Fisk then set up a buying operation, the New York Gold Room, where traders in their employ purchased as much gold as they could acquire, which artificially drove up the price. When Grant became aware of the full extent of the attempt to corner the market in late September 1869, he ordered the release of $4,500,000 in Treasury gold, which caused the price to collapse. Gould and Fisk were thwarted, but at the expense of a decline in the stock market and the overall economy. Babcock and other individuals who secretly invested with him lost $40,000 (about $750,000 in 2018)., and to satisfy his creditors, Babcock had to sign a trust deed on his property, which named Asa Bird Gardiner as trustee. The extent of Babcock's involvement was not revealed to Grant until 1876, when his complicity in the Gold Ring was uncovered during the investigation of his involvement in the Whiskey Ring.\n\nDating back to the Presidency of Abraham Lincoln it was common for distillers and corrupt Internal Revenue agents to make false whiskey production reports and pocket unpaid tax revenue. However, during the early 1870s, the corruption became more organized by distillers, who used the illegally obtained money for bribery and illegal election financing, to the point where every agent in St. Louis was involved in corruption. This organized network, known as the Whiskey Ring, extended nationally and involved \"the printing, selling, and approving of forged federal revenue stamps on bottled whiskey.\" \n\nIn June 1874, President Grant appointed Benjamin Bristow as Secretary of Treasury, with authority to investigate the Whiskey Ring and prosecute wrongdoers. Bristow, a Kentuckian and Union Army veteran, was known for his honesty and integrity, and had served as the nation's first Solicitor General, also appointed by Grant. Bristow immediately discovered whiskey tax evasion among distillers and corrupt officials in the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Bureau. Bristow and Bluford Wilson, the Treasury Solicitor obtained Grant's permission to use secret agents appointed from outside the Treasury Department; as a result of the evidence they obtained, on May 10, 1875 Treasury Department agents raided and shut down corrupt distilleries in St. Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, seizing company financial records and other files. \n\nBristow then prosecuted the offenders by working with Grant's newly appointed Attorney General, Edwards Pierrepont, a popular New York reformer who had been involved in shutting down New York City's corrupt Tweed Ring. Information was soon discovered that Babcock was informing ring leader John McDonald in St. Louis of inspections by Bristow's agents, giving them time to hide incriminating evidence before agents arrived. Bristow believed Babcock was paid off by cash, two five-hundred-dollar bills, in one instance, hidden a inside cigar box, for this information and protection. McDonald was indicted in June, when Bristow obtained indictments against 350 distillers and government officials.\n\nIn July 1875, Bristow and Pierrepont met Grant, who was vacationing at Long Branch, and gave him evidence that Babcock was a member of the ring. Grant told Pierrepont \"Let no guilty man escape...\" and said if Babcock was guilty then it was the \"greatest piece of traitorism to me that a man could possibly practice.\" In October, Babcock was summoned in front of Grant, Bristow, and Pierrepont at the White House to explain two ambiguously signed \"Sylph\" telegrams hand written by Babcock. The first message said, \"\"I have succeeded. They will not go. I will write you.\" (December 10, 1874) and the second one said, \"We have official information that the enemy weakens. Push things.\"\" (February 3, 1875) Bristow had shown these messages to Grant at a cabinet meeting the same day. Babcock said something to Grant, unintelligible to Bristow and Pierrepont, and Grant appeared satisfied by Babcock's interpretation of the telegrams. \n\nPierrepont and Bristow, believing the matter to be crucial, insisted Babcock send a message to his telegraphic correspondent demanding that this individual come to Washington to give his version of the messages. After Babcock seemed to be taking too long, Pierrepont went to check on him and found Babcock writing a warning to revenue agent John A. Joyce, his St. Louis confederate, to be on his guard. Infuriated, Pierrepont grabbed Babcock's pen and dashed through his message yelling \"You don't want to send your argument; send the fact, and go there and make your explanation. \"I\" don't understand this.\" Grant, on the other hand, was divided between the loyalty he had for Babcock, and his desire for Bristow and Pierrepont, trustworthy members of his cabinet, to prosecute the Whiskey Ring. Since Babcock had no acceptable explanation for his messages, he was soon indicted November 4, 1875 for tax fraud.\n\nAs a military officer, on December 2, 1875 Babcock requested of Grant a military court martial, believing that an army tribunal would be favorable to his defense. On December 8, 1875, U.S. Attorney David Dyer followed Bristow's instructions to deny Babcock a court martial, setting his St. Louis jury trial for February, 1876. When Babcock's trial in St. Louis came up in February, Grant decided to testify in Babcock's defense. By this time, Grant said his critics were using Babcock to go after his own presidency. After cabinet members objected to Grant testifying in St. Louis as unseemly for a President, it was settled that Grant would give a deposition at the White House.\n\nOn February 8, 1876 Babcock was put on trial, an event that lasted eighteen days. Babcock's defense team was noted for its legal prowess, and included Grant's former Attorney General George Williams, a top criminal defense lawyer, Emory Storrs, and a former appeals judge (New York), John K. Porter. It took place at the U.S. Post Office and Custom House located at 218 North Third Street, and the status of the defendant made the trial a popular and well-attended spectacle. Demand to attend the courtroom proceedings was so great that only persons with signed passes and Whiskey Ring defendants were allowed in. Babcock arrived in civilian clothes, including sky-blue pants, a silk hat, and a light jacket. When court wasn't in session, Babcock stayed at the newly rebuilt Lindell Hotel on Sixth Street and Washington Avenue. \n\nGrant's White House deposition took place on February 12; it was notarized by Chief Justice Morrison Waite and witnessed by both Bristow and Pierrepont. At the deposition Grant fully supported the Whiskey Ring prosecutions, but he willfully refused to testify against Babcock, despite having been informed by Bristow of Babcock's duplicity, saying he had \"great confidence\" in Babcock's integrity, and that his confidence in Babcock was \"unshaken\". Grant's unprecedented testimony would prove to be devastating to for the Whiskey Ring prosecution team against Babcock.\n\nOn February 17, Babcock's defense read President Grant's powerful deposition that supported Babcock to the jury, and severely weakened any chance of Babcock being convicted. The same day, General William T. Sherman, testified at the trial, that Babcock's \"character has been very good.\" Grant's deposition, Sherman's in-person tesitmony, and Babcock's shrewed defense counsel led to his acquittal by the St. Louis jury. A rumor spread that Pierrepont had leaked information to Babcock that aided in his acquittal, but Pierrepont denied this and suggested that Babcock himself had started the rumor. A few months later Grant's appointed anti-corruption team broke up. Pierrepont resigned office on May 21, 1876 and was appointed by Grant United States Minister to the United Kingdom on July 11, 1876. Enmity between Grant and Bristow forced Bristow out of the cabinet, and he resigned on June 20, 1876.\n\nWhen Babcock returned to Washington, he went back to his White House office, as if there had been no trial. Grant's Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish, was furious, and pressured Grant to force Babcock to leave, saying that Grant merely had to dismiss Babcock, because as a military officer Babcock was subject to orders and had no recourse. Additionally Treasury Solicitor Wilson informed Grant that Babcock had been involved with the 1869 plot to corner the gold market. Grant finally dismissed Babcock from the White House and appointed his son Ulysses Jr. in Babcock's place. It was later discovered that Babcock used his Whiskey Ring kickbacks to purchase from Henry Shelton Sanford on Christmas Day, 1874 a home and over 50 acres of grove land near what became the city of Sanford, Florida.\n\nIn addition to being Grant's private secretary Grant had appointed Babcock as the District of Columbia's Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds. He was involved in the beautification of the city and improvements to its infrastructure, but was also tied to allegations of corruption. The city's territorial governor, Alexander Robey Shepherd, a Grant appointee, operated aggressively and Babcock and Shepherd were accused of personally profiting from construction projects within the city limits. Babcock's supervision included construction of the Chain Bridge over the Potomac River and the Anacostia Railroad Bridge. He also supervised the construction of the east wing of the new State, War and Navy Building. Babcock retained the Superintendent's position after he was dismissed from the White House in 1876, and served until March 3, 1877, when the Grant administration ended.\n\nOn April 15, 1876, Babcock was indicted for involvement in the Safe Burglary Conspiracy. In 1874, Richard Harrington, an Assistant United States Attorney for Washington, DC attempted to frame Columbus Alexander, leader of the Memorialists, an organization critical of Shepherd's management of the city. Harrington hired dishonest Secret Service agents to break into the U.S. Attorney's safe, using explosives to make it obvious that a burglary had occurred. To entrap Alexander, the conspirators took materials that were supposedly stolen from the safe to his home at night, intending to give them to him and then later arrest him for their possession. Alexander thwarted this effort by refusing to answer the door. At that point, the Secret Service agents arrested two other conspirators who pretended to be the supposed burglars, and had them sign false affidavits implicating Alexander in the burglary. The conspiracy collapsed when the Secret Service agents admitted at Alexander's trial that the charges were false, and Alexander was acquitted. The conspiracy was supposed to have included Babcock, who was said to have wanted to silence Alexander, a prominent Grant administration critic. Babcock was allegedly the broker between Harrington and the Secret Service, but was exonerated of direct involvement, however his continued ties to scandal and corruption increased public pressure on Grant to remove him from the White House.\n\nOn February 27, 1877 Grant appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses of the Fifth District, a low-profile position that enabled Babcock to earn a living by making use of his engineering skills without drawing undue public attention to himself. Babcock continued to serve under Grant and his successors Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, and Chester A. Arthur. On August 24, 1882, Arthur appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Sixth District, an appointment he carried out in addition to his Fifth District responsibilities.\nIn September 1879, Grant returned from his famous world tour. His popularity was as great as ever and Stalwart Republicans proposed to nominate him for a third term as president. Democrats sought to discredit his previous administration, including his cabinet and political appointees. On February 4, 1880, a color illustration by artist Joseph Keppler appeared in \"Puck\" magazine, in which Keppler ridiculed Grant and his associates, including Babcock, for past involvement in corruption.\n\nOn May 14, 1880, Connecticut Senator William W. Eaton, a Democrat read a memorial from Davis Hatch, who had been arrested in Santo Domingo in 1868 and was requesting reimbursement for the financial losses he said resulted from his imprisonment. According to Hatch, he was imprisoned on false charges and was going to be released, but Babcock, who visited the island nation in 1869 to secure an annexation treaty, interfered with Hatch's release from prison and was directly complicit in Hatch being falsely sentenced to a five month prison term. Republican Senator Roscoe Conkling defended Babcock, saying that the Senate investigating committee's majority report fully exonerated him and that Eaton raised the issue only to try giving Democrats an advantage in an election year.\n\nIn June 1880, the Republicans held their national convention in Chicago. Grant was nominated by Conkling, his main Stalwart supporter. Republicans deadlocked between Grant and the other frontrunners, James G. Blaine and John Sherman, and selected the dark horse Garfield as their presidential candidate. Arthur was selected for the vice presidential nomination, and Garfield went on to win the general election, defeating Democratic nominee Winfield S. Hancock.\n\nThe Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse project started in 1883, and Babcock was the supervising engineer. On June 2, 1884, Babcock and his associates were on duty were aboard the government schooner \"Pharos\" to deliver construction supplies, and were anxious to get to land because a sudden storm created hazardous ocean conditions. The captain decided not to cross over the inlet bar during the storm because the construction supplies weighed down the ship, and he feared grounding it. As the storm worsened, Captain Newins of the nearby \"Bonito\" led seven men in a rowboat to the \"Pharos\" in order to retrieve the passengers. In debating whether to wait out the storm on the \"Pharos\" or try to make land, Babcock told his associates that since Newins and his crew had rowed safely to the \"Pharos\", then they should be able to row to shore on tidal floods created by the storm. After eating their lunch on the \"Pharos\", Babcock and his associates boarded a rowboat and started for the shore. As they approached the inlet bar, swells capsized the boat several times, and it took on water. Babcock was thrown clear, but another person on the boat attached him to it by a lifeline. The boat and crew were battered by waves, oars, and other debris, and Babcock's lifeline was torn loose from the boat, which resulted in his drowning death. Upon reaching the shore, others who had been in the boat recovered Babcock's body and unsuccessfully tried to resuscitate him. Three others, including two of Babcock's associates, were also killed; the bodies of Babcock's associates, Levi P. Luckey and Benjamin F. Sutter, were recovered several days later, but the body of the fourth victim, a member of the boat's crew, was not found. The lighthouse construction project continued after Babcock's death, and was completed in 1887.\n\nScholars note Babcock's high class standing at West Point, engineering skills, and bravery during the American Civil War. Babcock also has been noted positively for his association with the antislavery views of the Radical Republicans, and for his dealings with African Americans from a position of equality, a trait which was uncommon for the white people of his era, even those who opposed slavery. Historians also make positive mention of Babcock's post-White House career, noting that he served for eight years as a government lighthouse inspector and engineer, and did so capably and honestly.\n\nHowever, historians are critical of Babcock's political power as Grant's White House military aide, shielded by Grant, and not subject to resignation. Historians are also highly suspicious of Babcock's unauthorized Santo Domingo annexation pre-agreement. His reputation was also marred by his involvement in the Gold Ring, the Whiskey Ring, and the Safe Burglary Conspiracy. Most historians agree that Babcock betrayed Grant while President, and remain perplexed at Grant's loyalty to his wartime comrade, including Grant's unprecedented White House deposition on Babcock's behalf. In defending Babcock, Grant was not fully candid with the truth in his own testimony, probably to protect his family and his presidency from further scandal. With Babcock's reputation largely narrowed to observations about his corruption, loyalty to Grant, and wartime bravery, historians are generally not able to consider him in a wider context because he did not author an autobiography, nor has he been the subject of an extended biography. Historian William McFeely criticized Babcock for ignoring ethical values in the spirit of opportunism and personal gain.\n\nOn November 22, 2016, Mississippi State University Libraries announced the digitalization of Babcock's private diaries. Babcock's diaries are part of Mississippi State University Libraries' Ulysses S. Grant Digital Collection. Babcock's diaries began in 1863 during the height of the American Civil War, including his perspective on the siege of Vicksburg and his wartime experiences in Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia. The diary collections also includes his famous post-war visit to Santo Domingo in 1869 serving as President Grant's special agent and personal secretary. The collection includes Babcock's supplementary materials of speeches, correspondence, and newspaper clippings. The Mississippi State University Libraries said that Babcock's brokerage of the annexation of Santo Domingo, \"began what became a string of controversies and scandals surrounding Babcock and his position as aide to the President.\" The scandals culminated in Babcock's involvement in the Whiskey Ring, indictment for tax fraud in 1875, and corruption trial in St. Louis in 1876. Throughout these scandals President Grant gave Babcock his confidence.\n\nAccording to presidential historian Charles W. Calhoun, Babcock emerged as Grant's \"political majordomo, if not his jackel.\" Grant's Secretary of State Hamilton Fish said Babcock \"has brains & very many excellent & gentlemanly qualities but is spoiled by his position & a want of delicacy & consideration for the official responsibilities & proper authority (official) of civilians.\"\n\n\nBooks\nPrimary\nInternet articles\n\nNew York Times\n\n"}

Based upon the custom of her community, she was unable to work and instead devoted her time to charitable activities. In 1895, she founded the first woman's club, known as Entre Nous, in the country. Besides hosting literary events, the club was responsible for the construction of the Queen Wilhelmina Park in Willemstad. She was invested as a Knight of the Order of the Liberator by Venezuela n 1902 and was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1932.\n\nRebecca Cohen Henriquez was born on 9 July 1864 in Willemstad in the Colony of Curaçao and Dependencies of the Dutch Empire to Esther (née Henriquez) and Salomón Cohen Henriquez. Her family, including her paternal grandparents, Esther (née Monsanto) and Daniel Cohen Henriquez, were part of the prosperous Sephardi Jewish community, which had roots in the Iberian peninsula, but had immigrated to Curaçao from Amsterdam in 1681. Her father was the Advocate General of the colony and Cohen Henriquez was his youngest child of six siblings.\n\nUntil the 1870s, education or employment for women were unacceptable under the societal norms of the times, but in the last quarter of the decade, educational facilities began offering schooling for girls. Cohen Henriquez began her schooling at the Colegio Smith and then transferred to the private girls' school, Colegio Colonial, which was operated by José R. Henriquez and his wife. The school, in which classes were taught in Spanish, offered courses in astronomy, etiquette, geography, languages (Dutch, English and French), math, religion, reading, and writing. She supplemented her education with lessons from her father in philosophy and Dutch literature.\n\nAs working was unacceptable for women of her class, when Cohen Henriquez finished her schooling, she participated in charitable works, providing food and financial support to the poor. She occupied her time with painting and embroidery creating goods which could be sold at bazaars she organized to raise money to provide assistance to others. Among the many activities for social welfare she engaged in was disaster and hurricane relief.\n\nIn 1883 (or 1895) Cohen Henriquez organized fourteen alumni of Colegio Colonial, including herself and Rebecca Alvares Correa; Angela Baiz; Lelia, Leonor and Raquel Capriles; Elmire Cohen Henriquez,; Anna Gravenhorst; Henriette de Leao Laguna; Habita Mendes Chumaceiro; Rosabelle and Sarah Penso; Julieta Pinedo; and Nettie van Lier into the Entre Nous Club, the first women's organization in Curaçao. Cohen Henriquez served as president of the organization from its founding until her death. All of the women except Anna Gravenhorst, who was Protestant, were from the Jewish community. Besides their social improvement projects, the ladies of the club hosted cultural events featuring literary and music recitals. In 1902, she was granted permission from the Dutch crown to accept a knighthood in the 4th degree to the Order of the Liberator from Venezuela.\n\nThe women of the club, conceived, planned, and funded the creation of the Queen Wilhelmina Park of Willemstad. An unusual undertaking, the women proved that they were able to manage and complete the project on their own initiative. Using proceeds from their programs, in which the club members and their friends performed, Entres Nous raised sufficient funds by 1899 to begin construction in the central downtown area, known as Punda, of a park to create recreational space for the residents. The plan was completed and officially opened in 1901, the first and only public park in the city and quickly became a social and cultural meeting center. Through the years, the club continued adding amenities, like benches, which were installed in 1907.\n\nIn 1930, Cohen Henriquez and the club decided to revitalize the park in honor of the fiftieth birthday of Queen Wilhelmina. Through Cohen Henriquez's dedication to the cause, they raised ƒ15,000 (fifteen thousand Antillean guilders) to commission a statue from the Florentine sculptor Pietro Ceccarelli. Cohen Henriquez was invested as a knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1932, becoming the first women to ever receive the Order of Orange-Nassau in Curaçao. The statue was created in Italy and shipped to Curaçao arriving on 29 December 1932. The statue, made of Carrara marble stood two and a half meters above the 3.5 meter pedestal and was unveiled during a ceremony held on 19 January 1933.\n\nCohen Henriquez died on 23 May 1935 in Willemstad. A marble plaque was erected in Queen Wilhelmina Park to memorialize her contributions to the creation of the park and her community service.\n\n"}

Niño, Guagua, Pampanga, Santos was the fourth of seven children of Gaudencio Santos, an overseer of farmland near Mount Arayat, and Rosalia Jiao. Rufino's three elder brothers were Manuel, Emiliano, and Quirino; his three sisters were Clara, Jovita, and Exequiela. Santos, nicknamed \"Pinong\", grew up in a house located 30 meters from what is now the Immaculate Conception Parish. He was active in church activities as an acolyte, and was later a choir member of the Manila Cathedral School. Two factors influenced his priestly vocation: his stint as an altar server, and the encouragement of Father Jose Tahon, Manila Cathedral's parish priest.\n\nHe entered San Carlos Seminary on July 25, 1921, and earned a Baccalaureate in Canon Law in 1929 and a Doctorate in Sacred Theology in July 1931 at Pontificia Universita Gregoriana. In 1927, the 19-year-old Santos and Leopoldo A. Arcaira, 24—both outstanding students of San Carlos Seminary—were the first recipients of the scholarships at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Italy.\n\nPinong was granted a Papal dispensation to be ordained below the canonical age of 24. On Oct. 25, 1931, two months shy of his 23rd birthday, Rufino J. Santos was ordained priest at the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome. He then served as assistant parish priest in Imus, Cavite and as a parish priest in Marilao, Bulacan.\n\nHis later successor as Archbishop, Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales, said during the Second World War,\n\nIn 1953, Santos was appointed Archbishop of Manila on February 10 and was installed on March 25 on the same year. Pope John XXIII made him a cardinal on 28 March 1960. He was the first native Filipino to become a cardinal. Santos paved the way for the founding of Catholic Charities (eventually known as Caritas Manila) and the reconstruction of St. Paul Hospital (now the Cardinal Santos Medical Center), which was established by the Maryknoll Sisters, and damaged by American bombardment during the Second World War. Santos also re-instituted the Philippine Trust Company and the Catholic Travel Office.\n\nDuring his years in Manila, he rebuilt the Manila Cathedral, which had been destroyed by Allied bombardment during the 1945 Liberation of Manila. It was dedicated on December 10, 1958. He hosted the visit of Pope Paul VI to the Philippines to attend the Asian Bishops’ Meeting. Santos served as the Archbishop of Manila from 1953 to 1973.\n\nSantos established the Church-run Radio Veritas and built important structures including the Our Lady of Guadalupe Minor Seminary along EDSA in Makati City; the Pius XII Catholic Center in Paco, Manila; and Villa San Miguel, the Archbishop's palace in Mandaluyong.\n\nCardinal Rosales said that Santos was a diabetic and that he suffered from a malignant brain tumor.\n\nHe died in Manila on 3 September 1973, 8 days after his 65th birthday. Following his death, a diplomatic report from the United States Embassy in Manila assessed his activities:\nSantos' opposition to \"Social Action\" programs, which he frequently expressed in heavy-handed fashion, did much to perpetuate the Church's image as a conservative organization, allied with the country's economic and social elite.\n\nCaritas Manila’s history began with a Cardinal that \"walked the talk\".\n\nCardinal Santos, the first Filipino Cardinal, became the 29th Archbishop of Manila in a post-war scenario that saw a nation plagued with the following: a high dependency on the upper class in the country's social, economic and political growth; a growing inequality in the distribution of wealth; a critical unfairness in labor, land and tenancy—all catalysts to the resurgence of the communist movement. It was to this disparate social order that Cardinal Santos spoke upon his installation:\n\nThis plan took shape soon after when the Cardinal appointed an eleven-man Administrative Board on October 1, 1953. And so a new era had dawned when the establishment of Caritas Manila (first known as Catholic Charities) brought structure and organization to the way the Church’s charitable works in the Archdiocese of Manila were being implemented.\n\nThe initial years were largely a period of identifying those who needed help the most, prioritizing and allocating medical aid, food and clothing when needed. These were superseded by programs that harnessed talents and opened up work opportunities for Manila's teeming masses, such as the educational assistance program and job placement program. Nonetheless, it was medical assistance, crisis intervention and emergency relief that had the greatest impact, reaching thousands of the sick and indigent. Cardinal Santos was \"reviled\" for his \"conservatism on social issues and business acumen\" . However, it was his vision and altruism that had made Caritas Manila a success and his most noteworthy accomplishment.\n\nThe CBCP announced that Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales would lead the August 26, 2008 centennial rites for Santos at his hometown of Sto. Nino, Guagua, Immaculate Conception Parish Church. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was to lead the event by unveiling a historical marker and a 6-foot statue of Santos (sculpted by Edillardo Paras) and donated by Cesar L. Villanueva's wife, Arlyn Sicangco-Villanueva, president of Holy Angel University in Angeles City, Pampanga. The rites also included the exhibit of Cardinal Santos memorabilia, loaned by the Archdiocese of Manila and the Kapampangan Museum at Clark. The bronze statue will sit atop a 7-foot concrete pedestal outside the Rufino J. Cardinal Santos Convention Hall adjacent to the parish church. Villanueva also presented to the President, a copy of the book “Padre Pinong, the First Filipino Cardinal” authored by Francis Musni.\n\nOn September 3, 2018, his 110th birth anniversary, to commemorate the legacy of Cardinal Santos, and for the preparation for the 60th anniversary of the renovation of the post-war Manila Cathedral, a mass and the cremonial tradition of raising of the galero was officiated by the present Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "72573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72573", "title": "Ted Taylor (physicist)", "text": "Ted Taylor (physicist)\n\nTheodore Brewster Taylor (more commonly known as Ted Taylor) was an accomplished American theoretical physicist, specifically concerning nuclear energy. His higher education includes a PhD from Cornell University in theoretical physics, and though Taylor is relatively unknown to the public, his most noteworthy contributions to the field of nuclear weaponry were his small bomb developments at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. He is credited with numerous landmarks in fission nuclear weaponry development, including having developed the smallest fission weapon ever tested by the U.S., the most powerful fission weapon ever tested by the U.S., and the most efficient fission weapon ever tested by the U.S. Though Ted was not considered a brilliant physicist from a calculative viewpoint, his vision and creativity allowed him to thrive in the field. The later part of Ted's career was focused on nuclear energy instead of weaponry, and included his work on Project Orion, nuclear reactor developments, and anti-nuclear proliferation.\n\nTed Taylor was born in Mexico City, Mexico on July 11, 1925. His mother and father were both Americans; his mother, Barbara Southworth Howland Taylor, held a PhD in Mexican literature from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, and his father, Walter Clyde Taylor, was the director of a YMCA in Mexico City. His father had been a widower with three sons. He then married Barbara in 1922, who was a widow with a son of her own. Therefore, Ted had four older half brothers, and they were old enough that Ted was essentially raised as an only child. Additionally, both of his maternal grandparents were congregationalist missionaries in Guadalajara Ted grew up in a house in Cuernavaca which had no electricity and was on the street corner of Atlixco 13. His home was quiet and religious. It was also filled with literature, mainly atlases and geographies, which he would read by candlelight. This habituation followed him into adulthood, never quite adapting to the societal standards for electricity. Taylor showed interest in chemistry, specifically pyrotechnics, when he received a chemistry set at the age of ten. This fascination was enhanced when his neighborhood, Atlixco 13, added a chemistry laboratory that served a small and exclusive university in the area. Through the lab Ted had access to items from local druggists that otherwise would not have been readily available. These items included corrosive chemicals, explosive chemicals, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid, which allowed him to conduct his own experiments. Taylor often looked at the 1913 New International Encyclopedia, which contained extensive chemistry, for new concoctions to make. These included sleeping drugs, small explosives, guncotton, precipitates, and many more. His mother was extremely tolerant of his experimentation; however, she prohibited any experiments that involved nitroglycerin. He attended the American School in Mexico City from elementary school through high school. Taylor had a passion for music and in the mornings before school he would quietly sit for an hour and listen to his favorite songs. He was a gifted student and finished the fourth through sixth grades in one year. Being an accelerated student, Taylor found himself three years younger than all of his friends as he emerged into his teens. Taylor graduated early from high school in 1941 at the age of 15. After graduation he left Mexico to attend the Exeter Academy, located in New Hampshire, for one year while he waited to meet the age requirements for universities in America. While at the Academy he developed an interest in physics, though he displayed poor academic performance in his courses. At Exeter he took Modern Physics which was taught by Elbert P. Little, a teacher who was greatly admired at the university. Elbert P. Little gave Ted a letter grade D on his final winter term examination, however he quickly brushed this failure off. Shortly after he confirmed that he wanted to be a physicist. Apart from education, he also developed an interest in throwing discus at Exeter. This interest continued into his college career, as he continued to throw discus at Caltech. He enrolled at the California Institute of Technology in 1942 and then spent his second and third years in the Navy V-12 program. This accelerated his schooling and he graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics from the university in 1945 at just nineteen years old. After graduation, he attended the midshipman school at Throgs Neck, in Bronx, New York for one year to fulfill his naval active duty requirement. By the end of his time in the Navy he had received the status of Junior Grade Lieutenant. The Navy let him out in the summer of 1946 and he enrolled in a graduate program in theoretical physics at the University of California at Berkeley. During his graduate schooling, Ted worked part-time at the Berkeley Radiation laboratory, mainly on the cyclotron and a beta-ray spectrograph. After failing an oral preliminary examination on mechanics and heat, and a second prelim in modern physics in 1949, Taylor was disqualified from the graduate program.\n\nTaylor married Caro Armin in 1948 and had five children in the following years- Clare Hastings, Katherine Robertson, Christopher Taylor, Robert Taylor, and Jeffrey Taylor. Caro Armin was majoring in Greek at Scripps College, a Liberal Arts University in Claremont California. The drive from the California Institute of Technology was a relatively short commute, so Taylor went down to visit her whenever he could. Both Caro and Taylor were very shy people, and unsure of what the future held. When they first met they both believed that Ted would be a college professor in a sleepy town, and that Caro would be a librarian. They felt that these professions in a small college town was their speed. After 44 years of marriage the couple divorced in 1992.\n\nTaylor eventually gained acceptance into a physics PhD program at the University of Cornell in 1953 and completed the program in 1954. At Cornell, Ted maintained his childhood passion for music and had his room equipped with a speaker system. This was uncommon among his experimentalist physicist peers, but his theoretical physicists embraced the music. While at Cornell Taylor picked up the hobby of billiards, and in the afternoons after school he played billiards for almost ten hours a week. He believed that billiards related to particle physics; of capture cross-sections and neutron scattering, of infinite reflectors and fast-neutron-induced fission chain reaction. The behavior of the interacting balls on the table, and the nature of their elastic collisions, all within the confining framework of the reflector cushions, helped him to conceptualize these difficult abstractions.\n\nPrior to Taylor's work at Los Alamos, he had actually firmly declared an anti-nuclear weapons stance. While at the midshipmen school, he received news of the atomic bomb that the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima Japan. He immediately wrote a letter home discussing the perils of nuclear proliferation and his fears that it would lead to the end of mankind in the event of another war. He showed some optimism though, as he felt with proper leadership the nuclear bomb could actually result in the end of wars on earth. Either way, he was still very curious about the field of nuclear physics after his time as an undergraduate.\n\nTheodore Taylor began his work in nuclear physics in 1949 when he was hired to a junior position at Los Alamos in the Theoretical Division. He received this job after failing out of the PhD program at Berkley; J. Carson Mark connected Taylor with a leader at Los Alamos and recommended him for a position. Taylor was unsure of the details about his new job at Los Alamos prior to his arrival. He had only been briefed that his first assignment was to investigate the Neutron Diffusion Theory, which is a theoretical analysis of neutron movement within a nuclear core. While at work at Los Alamos, his strictly anti-nuclear development beliefs changed. His theory on preventing nuclear war turned to developing bombs of unprecedented power in an attempt to make people, including governments, so afraid of nuclear warfare that they wouldn’t dare engage in this sort of altercation. He continued in his junior position at Los Alamos until 1953, when he took a temporary leave of absence to obtain his PhD from Cornell. He returned to the program in 1954, and by 1956 he was famous for his work in small bomb development. In fact, Freeman Dyson is quoted as saying, \"A great part of the small-bomb development of the last five years [at Los Alamos] was directly due to Ted\". Although the majority of the brilliant minds at Los Alamos were focused on developing the fusion bomb, Ted remained hard at work on improving fission bombs. His innovations in this area of study were so important that he was eventually given the freedom to choose whatever he wanted to study, instead of being confined to the narrow scope of direct orders. Eventually, Ted's stance on nuclear warfare and weapon development changed, and thus altered his projected career path. In 1956, Taylor left his position at Los Alamos and went to work for a company called General Atomics. Here, he developed TRIGA, which was a reactor that produced isotopes used in the medical field. Taylor then began working on Project Orion, which was a project that sought to develop a form of space travel that relied on nuclear energy as the fuel source, in 1958. The spacecraft was proposed to utilize a series of nuclear fission reactions as its source of propellant, thus improving space travel while eliminating the earth's source of fuel for nuclear weaponry. In collaboration with his close friend Freeman Dyson, Taylor lead the project development team for six years until the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was instituted. After this treaty, the project was no longer viable because they could not test their developments.\n\nTaylor was also featured in the 1984 PBS series, \"The Voyage of the Mimi\", starring a young Ben Affleck.\n\nTheodore Taylor's career shifted again after project Orion. He developed an even greater fear of the potential ramifications of his entire life’s work, and began taking precautionary measures to mitigate those concerns. In 1964 he served as the deputy director of the Defense Atomic Support Agency (a branch within the Department of Defense), where he managed the U.S. nuclear weapons inventory. Then, in 1966 he created a consulting firm called the International Research and Technology Corporation, located in Vienna, Austria, which sought to prevent the development of more nuclear weapons programs. Taylor also worked as a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz and Princeton University. His focus eventually turned to renewable energy, and In 1980 Taylor started a company called Nova Incorporated, which focused on nuclear energy alternatives as a means of supplementing the energy requirements of the earth. He studied energy capture from sources like cooling ice ponds and heating solar ponds, and eventually turned to energy conservation within buildings. Concerning this work in energy conservation, he founded a not-for-profit organization in Montgomery County, Maryland called Damascus Energy, which focuses on energy efficiency within the home. Theodore Taylor also served on the President of the United States' commission concerning the Three Mile Island Accident, working to mitigate the issues associated with the reactor meltdown.\n\nTheodore Taylor was involved in many important projects and made numerous contributions to nuclear development for the United States. During his time at Los Alamos, He was responsible for designing the smallest fission bomb of the era, named Davy Crockett, which weighed only 60 pounds, measured approximately 12 inches across, and could produce between 10 and 20 kilotons of force. This device was formerly known as the M28 Weapons System. The Davy Crockett itself was the M388 Atomic Round fired from the weapons system, which functioned similarly to how any other modern rocket propelled round would (See RPG). It was a mounted weapons system, which means that it would be set up, aimed, and fired as a crew-served weapon. Taylor also designed fission bombs even smaller than Davy Crockett, but those were not developed until long after he left Los Alamos. Furthermore, he even designed a bomb so small that it weighed only 20 pounds, but it was never actually developed and tested. Additionally, Taylor designed the Super Alloy Bomb, also known as the \"SOB,\" which still holds the record for the largest fission explosion ever tested, producing over 500 kilotons of force. Furthermore, Taylor was credited with developing multiple techniques that improved the fission bomb. For example, he was largely responsible for the development of boosting, which is a technique that improves the reaction yield and efficiency of a nuclear reaction. This technique was a re-invention of the implosion mechanism that was used in the bomb detonated at Hiroshima. He theorized a series of nuclear reactions within the implosion mechanism that, in combination, trigger the large chain reaction to detonate. This eliminated much of the energy waste and necessity for precision of the original reaction mechanism. This technique is still found in all U.S. fission nuclear weapons today. He also was responsible for developing a technique that greatly reduced the size of atomic bombs. First tested in a bomb called “Scorpion,” it utilized a reflector made of beryllium, which was drastically lighter than the metals that generally were used as reflectors. After these types of breakthroughs, Taylor became more of an important figure at Los Alamos. He was included in high priority situations reserved for important personnel, and was even taken to the pentagon as a consultant on strategies and the potential outcomes of a nuclear war with Russia. In total, Taylor was responsible for the development of eight bombs- the Super Alloy Bomb, Davey Crockett, Scorpion, Hamlet, Bee, Hornet, Viper, and the Puny Plutonium bomb. The latter, called the Puny Plutonium bomb, was the first ever dud in the history of U.S. nuclear tests. Furthermore, he produced the bomb called Hamlet after receiving direct orders from military officials to pursue a project in bomb efficiency, which ended up being the most efficient bomb in the history of the U.S.\n\nApart from bombs, Ted also explored concepts of producing large amounts of nuclear fuel in an expedited manner. His plans, known as MICE (Megaton Ice Contained Explosions), essentially sought to plant a thermonuclear weapon deep in the ice and detonate it, resulting in a giant underground pool of radioactive materials that could then be retrieved. While his idea had merit, He ultimately received little support for this concept and the project never came to fruition.\n\nTed Taylor was an accomplished author in the latter part of his career. He worked in cooperation with many specialists in other fields to publish his work on anti-nuclear proliferation and sustainable nuclear energy. Perhaps the greatest fear that propelled him to work so fervently in these areas was the realization that the consequences of nuclear material ending up in the wrong hands could be severe.\n\n\"Nuclear Theft: Risks and Safeguards\" is a book that Theodore Taylor wrote in collaboration with Mason Willrich in the 1970s. According to reviews, the book predicted a future where nuclear energy was the primary energy source in the United States, and therefore needed enhanced protective measures to protect the public. In the book, Taylor and Willrich provide multiple recommendations on ways to prevent nuclear material from ending up in the wrong hands, as they anticipated that there would be multiple more sources of nuclear byproducts and therefore more opportunity for nuclear theft. This book likely was a culmination of much of Ted's work in the field, as he often toured nuclear reactor sites and provided insight on potential weak points in their security measures.\n\nTaylor also Co-authored the book, \"The Restoration of the Earth,\" with Charles C. Humpstone, which, according to reviews, focused on techniques to enhance sustainability, as well as expanded on different sources of energy that could be used alternatively to meet the power needs of the earth. This book was also a culmination of his focus on nuclear security and the ramifications of the use of nuclear weaponry. In it he addressed the potential effects of nuclear fallout on the environment. This 1973 hardcover discussed potential sources of energy in the year 2000, along with the conceptualization of safer alternatives to the methods of acquiring nuclear energy that were available at the time. In fact, Taylor indirectly referenced a concept for a nuclear reactor which is inherently similar to a reactor that he patented in 1964. Theodore Taylor spent much of his time studying the risk potential of the nuclear power fuel cycle after learning about the detrimental effects that his nuclear weapons had on the environment, so he sought to explore new opportunities for safer use of nuclear power. In his writing, Taylor argued that the most dangerous and devastating events that could possibly occur during nuclear research would most likely happen at reactors that are incapable of running efficiently and maintaining a safe temperature. Taylor went on to state that the prioritization of safety in nuclear reactors is relatively low compared to how it should be, and that if one were to create a nuclear reactor with the capability of cooling down—without the initiation of a fission reaction—then efforts at harvesting nuclear energy would be more incentivized and exponentially safer.\n\nTaylor also wrote the book \"Nuclear Proliferation: Motivations, Capabilities and Strategies for Control\" with Harold Feiveson and Ted Greenwood. The book explains the two most dangerous mechanisms by which nuclear proliferation could be devastating for the world, as well as how to disincentivize nuclear proliferation within destabilizing political systems.\n\nTaylor further collaborated with George Gamow on a study called, \"What the World Needs Is a Good Two-Kiloton Bomb,\" which investigated the concept of small nuclear artillery weapons. This paper reflected another shift in Taylor’s beliefs about nuclear weapons. He had changed from his deterrent position to a position that sought to develop small yield nuclear weapons that could target specific areas and minimize collateral damage.\n\nTed Taylor was not only involved in the publication of the aforementioned books, but he, along with a few of his colleagues, was also responsible for a number of patents involving nuclear physics. Taylor is credited with patenting a nuclear reactor with a prompt negative temperature coefficient and fuel element, along with a patent protecting their discovery of an efficient method of producing isotopes from thermonuclear explosions. The patent concerning the production of isotopes from thermonuclear explosions was groundbreaking because of its efficiency and cost effectiveness. It also provides a means for attaining necessary elements that otherwise are difficult to find in nature. prior to this discovery, the cost per neutron in a nuclear reaction was relatively high. The patent concerning the prompt negative temperature coefficient was groundbreaking because it provided a markedly safer reactor even in the event of misuse. With the negative temperature coefficient, the reactor can mitigate sudden surges of reactivity propelled into the system. These patented realizations would later become vital components in the future of nuclear technology.\n\n\"The Curve of Binding Energy\", by John McPhee, is written primarily about the life of Theodore Taylor, as he and McPhee traveled together quite often—spending a great deal of time with one another. It is evident that during their time together, McPhee was very inclined to learn from Taylor. Many of Taylor’s personal opinions regarding nuclear energy and safety are mentioned throughout McPhee’s writing. McPhee voices one of Taylor’s bigger concerns in particular—that plutonium can be devastating if left in the wrong hands. According to McPhee, Taylor suspected that if plutonium were to be acquired by someone with ill-intentions and handled improperly, the aftermath could be catastrophic—as plutonium is a rather volatile element and can be lethal for anyone within hundreds of miles. This clearly can be avoided, Taylor suggests, if nuclear reactors are protected and all sources of nuclear fuel elements are heavily guarded. Ultimately, it is evident that most of Taylor’s writing—along with McPhee’s narration of Taylor’s viewpoints and suggestions—is ahead of its time and still applicable today.\n\nAccording to Freitas and Merkle, the only known extant source on Taylor’s concept of the “Santa Claus machine” is found in Nigel Calder's \"Spaceships of the Mind\". The concept would use a large mass spectrometer to separate an ion beam into atomic elements for later use in making products.\n\nTaylor was a member of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs and attended several of its meetings during the 1980s. After his retirement he lived in Wellsville, New York.\n\nHe died on October 28, 2004 of coronary artery disease.\n\nFreeman Dyson said of Taylor, \"Very few people have Ted's imagination. ... I think he is perhaps the greatest man that I ever knew well. And he is completely unknown.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Drake\n\nThomas Andrews Drake (born 1957) is a former senior executive of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), a decorated United States Air Force and United States Navy veteran, and a whistleblower. In 2010, the government alleged that Drake mishandled documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the Trailblazer Project. He is the 2011 recipient of the Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling and co-recipient of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award.\n\nOn June 9, 2011, all 10 original charges against him were dropped. Drake rejected several deals because he refused to \"plea bargain with the truth\". He eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer; Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project, who helped represent him, called it an act of \"civil disobedience.\"\n\nDrake's father was a World War II veteran and his mother a secretary for Pearl S. Buck. He entered the U.S. Air Force in 1979, becoming an Airborne Voice Processing Specialist, with a fluency in German, and went on ELINT (electronic intelligence) missions. It was in that capacity that he encountered the surveillance state of East Germany and the Stasi, which informed his worldview and to which he compares developments in the United States since the September 11 attacks. Drake left the Air Force in 1989. He was also in the U.S. Navy, where he analyzed intelligence for the National Military Joint Intelligence Center. According to the Washington Post, he also at one time worked with the CIA. In 1989, Drake began work as an NSA contractor, evaluating software. As a contractor, he worked on projects like JACKPOT and LIBRARIAN, becoming an expert in the quality-testing of software and working on a system for measuring the quality of computer code at the NSA. Drake also continued his academic studies.\n\nIn 2000, he was hired as a software systems quality specialist and management and information technology consultant for Columbia, Maryland-based Costal Research & Technology Inc. (CRTI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexandria, Virginia-based Computer Systems Management, Inc. (CSMI). In late 2001, he went to work at the NSA as a full-time employee at the Signals Intelligence Directorate at Fort Meade, Maryland, with his actual first day on the job as an NSA employee being September 11, 2001. In 2002, he became a Technical Director for Software Engineering Implementation within the Cryptologic Systems and Professional Health Office. In 2003, Drake became a Process Portfolio Manager within NSA's newly formed Directorate of Engineering. He held a Top Secret security clearance. During the congressional investigations into 9/11, he testified about NSA failures. In 2006 he was reassigned to the National Defense University, where he became the NSA Chair and an Assistant Professor of Behavioral Sciences within the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF). Drake was forced to leave the NDU in 2007 when his security clearance was suspended, and he resigned from the NSA the next year. Drake then went to work at Strayer University but was forced from that job after his indictment of April 2010. He found work at an Apple Store. He then founded Knowpari Systems, a consulting firm.\n\nIn 2011, Drake was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Truth Telling and was co-recipient of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award. Accepting the SAAII award he said, with references to an 1857 speech of Frederick Douglass: \n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the NSA desired new tools to collect intelligence from the growing flood of information pouring out of the new digital networks like the internet. Drake became involved in the internal NSA debate between two of these tools, the Trailblazer Project and the ThinThread project. He became part of the \"minority\" that favored ThinThread for several reasons, including its theoretical ability to protect the privacy of US individuals while gathering intelligence. Trailblazer required billions of dollars, dwarfing the cost of ThinThread. Drake eventually became \"disillusioned, then indignant\" regarding the problems he saw at the agency. Around 2000, NSA head Michael Hayden chose Trailblazer over ThinThread; ThinThread was cancelled and Trailblazer ramped up, eventually employing IBM, SAIC, Boeing, CSC, and others.\n\nDrake worked his way through the legal processes that are prescribed for government employees who believe that questionable activities are taking place in their departments. In accordance with whistleblower protection laws such as the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, Drake complained internally to the designated authorities: to his bosses, the NSA Inspector General, the Defense Department Inspector General, and both the House and Senate Congressional intelligence committees.\n\nHe also kept in contact with Diane Roark, a staffer for the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee of the U.S. Congress (the House committee responsible for oversight of the executive branch's intelligence activities). Roark was the \"staff expert\" on the NSA's budget, and the two of them had met in 2000.\n\nIn September 2002, Roark and three former NSA officials, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Ed Loomis, filed a DoD Inspector General report regarding problems at NSA, including Trailblazer. Drake was a major source for the report, and gave information to DoD during its investigation of the matter. Roark tried to notify her superior, then-Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Porter Goss. She also attempted to contact William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court at the time. In addition, Roark made an effort to inform Vice President Dick Cheney's legal counsel David Addington, who had been a Republican staff colleague of hers on the committee in the 1980s. Addington was later revealed by a Washington Post report to be the author of the controlling legal and technical documents for the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program, typing the documents on a Tempest-shielded computer across from his desk in room 268 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and storing them in a vault in his office. Roark got no response from all three men.\n\nBy 2003, the NSA Inspector General (IG) had declared Trailblazer an expensive failure. It cost more than 1 billion dollars.\n\nIn 2004, the DoD IG produced a final report of its investigation that had been prompted by Roark & the others in 2002. The report basically agreed with their assertions and found very serious flaws at NSA. For a time, the NSA was even banned from starting projects over a certain size, for fear it would waste the money. However, there were no plans to release this DoD IG report to the public at the time.\n\nIn a 2011 \"New Yorker\" article, journalist Jane Mayer wrote that Drake felt the NSA was committing serious crimes against the American people, on a level worse than what President Nixon had done in the 1970s. Drake reviewed the laws regarding disclosure of information, and decided that if he revealed unclassified information to a reporter, then the worst thing that would happen to him was probably that he would be fired.\n\nIn November 2005, Drake contacted Siobhan Gorman of \"The Baltimore Sun\" newspaper, sending her emails through Hushmail and discussing various topics. He claims that he was very careful not to give her sensitive or classified information; it was one of the basic ground rules he set out at the beginning of their communication. This communication occurred around 2006. Gorman wrote several articles about waste, fraud, and abuse at the NSA, including articles on Trailblazer. She received an award from the Society of Professional Journalists for her series exposing government wrongdoing. Judge Richard Bennett later ruled that \"there is no evidence that Reporter A relied upon any allegedly classified information found in Mr. Drake's house in her articles\".\n\nIn July 2007, armed FBI agents raided the homes of Roark, Binney, and Wiebe, the same people who had filed the complaint with the DoD Inspector General in 2002. Binney claims they pointed guns at his wife and himself. Wiebe said it reminded him of the Soviet Union. None of these people were charged with any crimes. In November 2007, there was a raid on Drake's residence. His computers, documents, and books were confiscated. He was never charged with giving any sensitive information to anyone; the charge actually brought against him is for 'retaining' information (). The FBI tried to get Roark to testify against Drake; she refused. Reporter Gorman was not contacted by the FBI.\n\nDrake initially cooperated with the investigation, telling the FBI about the alleged illegality of the NSA's activities. The government created a 'draft indictment' of Drake, prepared by prosecutor Steven Tyrrell. It listed charges as \"disclosing classified information to a newspaper reporter and for conspiracy\". Diane Roark, Binney, Wiebe, and Loomis (the complainants to the DoD IG in 2002) were also allegedly listed as \"unindicted co-conspirators\". In 2009 a new prosecutor came on the case, William Welch II, and changed the indictment. Some charges were removed, as was any naming of 'co-conspirators'. The new case only contained charges against Drake.\n\nProsecutors wanted Drake to plead guilty, but he refused. He believed that he was innocent of the charges against him. The government wanted him to help prosecute the other whistleblowers. He refused this as well. He later explained his motivations to the Ridenhour Prizes organization:\n\nIn April 2010, Drake was indicted by a Baltimore, Maryland grand jury on the following charges:\n\nThe indictment contained many other allegations; most of them did not relate to the actual charges against him. He was not specifically charged with unauthorized disclosure of classified information, nor was he charged at all under , the \"SIGINT\" statute. The indictment gave details about his communications with Roark and with Gorman, but he was not charged with any crime directly relating to those communications. The indictment also did not list the names of Gorman or Roark, but they were confirmed by reporters (e.g. Mark Hosenball of \"Newsweek\"). Roark's lawyer claimed that the indictment contains a \"mischaracterization of the facts\" about the relationship between her client and Drake. Roark herself later spoke out in support of Drake and the other whistleblowers of the Trailblazer project.\n\nThe \"willful retention\" charges regarded five documents allegedly \"related to the national defense\" that were found at Drake's residence. The five documents in question were referred to as \"What a Success,\" \"the Regular Meetings,\" \"Volume is our Friend,\" \"Trial and Testing,\" and \"Collections Sites.\" \"What a Success\" was declassified a few months after Drake was indicted, and should never have been classified in the first place, according to an official complaint filed by J. William Leonard, a former director of the Information Security Oversight Office. \"Regular Meetings\" was marked \"UNCLASSIFIED\" and posted on NSANet but prosecution argues the defendant should have known it was really classified. Drake's team also argued that the latter three of the five named documents were part of a collection of thousands of unclassified papers related to the DoD Inspector General Report (mentioned above). Drake's defense attorneys argued this meant that the defendant brought home the material accidentally, not \"willfully.\"\n\nThe obstruction charge was related to Drake allegedly deleting documents while he was purportedly aware that the FBI was investigating leaks to the media, and that the FBI was contemplating investigating leaks to Siobhan Gorman of \"The Baltimore Sun\". The false statements charge was filed in relation to the FBI's questioning of Drake without a lawyer present in the initial stages of the investigation when he was cooperating with them. One count is for alleged statements made by him regarding whether he had willfully taken certain documents home. Another count is for allegedly lying about the purported transmission of classified information to Gorman. Drake's defenders point out that the government's own expert found that he had not destroyed any evidence. They also point out that Drake was careful not to give any classified information to Gorman, and that many of the documents in question were 'retroactively classified' after they were seized from his home by the FBI.\n\nThe federal offices involved in filing the indictment included the DOJ Public Integrity Section, DOJ Criminal Division, DOJ National Security Division, the FBI, and the NSA Office of Security & Counterintelligence. Drake was represented by James Wyda and Deborah Boardman, federal public defenders.\n\nDrake was also a client of the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower non-profit. Jesselyn Radack, director of Homeland Security and Human Rights for GAP, worked with Drake. Author and NSA authority James Bamford was a consultant for Drake's defense as well.\n\nGovernment prosecutor William M. Welch II, who had previously been charged with contempt and removed from the Ted Stevens case, served as the government's initial Senior Litigation Counsel, John P. Pearson of the DOJ Public Integrity Section was the government's Trial Attorney, and Lanny A. Breuer was in charge of overseeing the prosecution.\n\nFederal Judge Richard D. Bennett was responsible for hearing handling the case, and initially set trial for June 2011.\n\nThe Drake case has been written about in the \"Washington Post\", the \"New York Times\", Agence France-Press, \"Newsweek\", \"Wired\", the Washingtonian.com, the Federation of American Scientists' Secrecy News, \"Politico\", and elsewhere. Jesselyn Radack, of the Government Accountability Project, has also discussed the case.\n\nThe U.S. government publicly stated that the prosecution of Thomas Drake was not intended to deter government employees from reporting problems. \"Whistle-blowers are the key to many, many department investigations—we don't retaliate against them, we encourage them,\" Matthew A. Miller, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said. \"This indictment was brought on the merits, and nothing else.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2011, the prosecution made several moves to restrict the normally open proceedings of a jury trial in a United States courtroom, as reported by Gerstein at \"Politico\" and others. This was done under the legal auspices of the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), which attempts in theory to prevent the release of classified information during open trials. The prosecution also moved to use the controversial \"silent witness rule,\" in which exhibits are hidden from the public by the use of \"code words\" in court. The government had only attempted to use the rule a handful of times previously; its legality has been challenged under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The government also moved to restrict cross-examination of witnesses, to restrict jurors from reading the Siobhan Gorman \"Baltimore Sun\" articles about problems with NSA and Trailblazer, and to prevent the defense from making arguments or introducing evidence to the courtroom about whistleblowing or overclassification.\n\nIn addition, the prosecution also had the court seal two exhibits the defense had already published in one of its public court filings, which listed various documents the prosecution would try to use at trial.\n\nThe prosecution argued that the CIPA also applied to non-classified information and attempted to have unclassified information presented at trial in redacted form only.\n\nReferring to Siobhan Gorman's \"Baltimore Sun\" news stories, the government legally pleaded that the \"newspaper articles are unduly prejudicial. The only purpose for the admission of these newspaper articles is to put NSA on trial.\" The prosecution also contended that it had no legal obligation to prove Drake's intent to harm national security, saying that it \"does not have to prove that defendant intended to harm the country\" under the specific part of the Espionage Act that Drake was charged with; . As for the 'overclassification' defense, the government argued that such a defense claim would be 'confusing to the jury' and thus irrelevant to the charges. The government also argued that any discussion at trial of the legal concept of whistle-blowing would likewise be irrelevant to the charges.\n\nIn early June, shortly after the May 22, 2011, broadcast of a \"60 Minutes\" episode on the Drake case, the government dropped all of the charges against Drake and agreed not to seek any jail time in return for Drake's agreement to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor of misusing the agency's computer system.\n\nAt the July sentencing hearing the presiding judge, Richard D. Bennett of Maryland's Federal District Court, issued harsh words for the government, saying that it was \"unconscionable\" to charge a defendant, two years after his home was searched, with a list of serious crimes that could have resulted in 35 years in prison, only to drop the 10 counts of the indictment on the eve of trial. Expressing his \"irritation\" with the prosecution, Bennett also completely rejected the government's request for a $50,000 fine, despite the sentencing guidelines recommending a fine of $500-$5,000. He noted that Drake had been financially devastated, spending $82,000 on his defense, losing his $154,600 job at the NSA and his pension, and being fired from his university teaching position. He sentenced Drake to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service.\n\nDrake appeared on \"The Daily Show\" on August 6, 2012, to talk about the history of his case, and in September sent an audio message of support to CryptoParty.\n\nOn March 15, 2013, Drake spoke at a National Press Club Luncheon about the national intelligence community and its attitude towards whistle-blowing.\n\nDrake inspired Edward Snowden to leak information on the NSA spying program PRISM in June 2013. Snowden went public rather than reporting within the system due to the reprisals against Drake (and other whistleblowers), which led the Assistant Defense Dept Inspector General (DoD IG) in charge of the whistleblower unit, John Crane, to himself become a whistleblower when it became apparent that Drake's identity had been leaked by DoD IG to the Justice Dept.\n\nDrake has become an activist against the surveillance state, frequently giving interviews and speaking at events such as Restore the Fourth. One of the themes of his speeches and interviews is a \"privacy exercise\" as follows \"Put your entire life in a box, your documents, bank accounts, your passwords, everything—and give it to a complete stranger—a fellow American for safekeeping. Would you do it?\" he states that he has yet to encounter a \"yes.\"\n\nIn a September 2013 interview, Drake reaffirmed his belief that the problems of the NSA are so chronic and systemic that the only solution would be to completely dismantle and subsequently rebuild the entire organization.\n\nOn July 3, 2014, Drake along with former Technical Director of the NSA William Binney gave testimony to the German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal. He described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German secret service BND.\n\nOn November 10, 2015, Drake appeared on a PEN American Center panel at the Newseum about \"Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security and Free Expression.\"\n\nDrake is one of four individuals in the history of the United States who has been charged specifically with \"willful retention\" of \"national defense\" information under . Most prosecutions are for \"delivery\" of classified information to a third party—something that Drake was not charged with. This particular portion of the Espionage Act was created in 1950 during the Second Red Scare, as part of the McCarran Internal Security Act. Anthony Russo and Daniel Ellsberg were the first to be prosecuted for the \"retention\" of what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers, which Ellsberg gave to the \"New York Times\", eventually resulting in another landmark Espionage Act case in 1971, \"New York Times Co. v. United States\". The prosecution of Russo and Ellsberg was dismissed in 1972 because of government misconduct. The second prosecution was of Samuel Loring Morison in 1985, a Navy analyst who sold satellite photographs to \"Jane's Defense Weekly\"; he was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton. The third was the American Israel Public Affairs Committee case in 2005, \"United States v. Franklin, Rosen, and Weissman\".\n\nDrake is a founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity.\nIn September 2015, Drake and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to the President challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee on the Central Intelligence Agency's use of torture.\n\nIn 2014, a documentary called \"Silenced\", in which Drake was featured, was released. It was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2016. Having an analogous theme as the Oscar-winning documentary \"Citizenfour\", which portrays similar treatment of Edward Snowden, \"Silenced\" has been the official selection and recipient of several awards from multiple film festivals even before its release to major cable networks in March 2015.\n\nAlso in 2014, Drake's involvement with Thinthread, his subsequent indictment, etc., along with others associated with his activities (Roark, Binney, Wiebe, Loomis), and Snowden were featured in a PBS documentary, \"United States of Secrets\".\n\nDrake is featured throughout the 2016 documentary \"Nothing to Hide\", regarding government surveillance and internet privacy.\n\n\n"}

He is the first outlaw to organize a stagecoach robbery in the United States.\n\nBorn Thomas J. Hodges in Rome, Tennessee, he saw action in the Mexican–American War as a surgeon. Following the war he traveled to California during the California Gold Rush but was unsuccessful as a prospector, later drifting around California as a gambler and as a doctor at times for several years. The outlaw \"Doc Hedges\" was arrested for stealing five mules. When he was arrested in 1855, wanting to confuse the peace officers, he gave the name Tom Bell, a small time cattle rustler. In 1855 he was serving time in Angel Island Prison for robbery when he met Bill Gristy and successfully escaped several weeks later. He escaped with the help of his profession as a doctor by faking a severe illness that fooled the prison doctor, which allowed him to escape. With Gristy, Bell formed an outlaw gang of five men and began robbing stages for several months.\n\nOn August 12, 1856, after their spy spotted the Camptonville-Maryville stage carrying $100,000 worth of gold bullion, the gang unsuccessfully attempted to rob it. In an exchange of gunfire a woman passenger was killed and two male passengers were wounded before the gang was driven off by the stagecoach guards. The woman passenger on board who was killed by the attempt, was a black woman by the name of Mrs. Tilghman, the wife of a popular barber from Maryville.\n\nThe robbery and death of the woman passenger angered citizens, and both a sheriff's posse and citizen vigilantes conducted a massive search for the gang. By late September Gristy was captured. Under threat of being turned over to the irate lynch mob outside the jail, he confessed the location of Bell. The Stockton Sheriff raced to arrest him. When he found Bell near Firebaugh's Ferry on October 4, 1856, an impromptu posse commanded by Judge George Gordon Belt, a Merced River rancher, had already hanged him.\n\nDespite the lack of success Bell had in his attempted stagecoach robbery, his example was soon followed by other outlaws with more success.\n\n"}
{"id": "61853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61853", "title": "Tom Petty", "text": "Tom Petty\n\nThomas Earl Petty (October 20, 1950 – October 2, 2017) was an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actor. He was the lead singer of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, formed in 1976. He previously led the band Mudcrutch. He was also a co-founder of the late 1980s supergroup the Traveling Wilburys.\n\nPetty recorded a number of hit singles with the Heartbreakers and as a solo artist. In his career, he sold more than 80 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He and the Heartbreakers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Petty died on October 2, 2017, one week after the completion of the Heartbreakers' 40th anniversary tour.\n\nPetty was born October 20, 1950, in Gainesville, Florida, the first of two sons of Kitty (Katherine) Petty, a local tax office worker, and Earl Petty, who worked in a grocery store. He had a brother, Bruce, who was seven years younger. His interest in rock and roll music began at age ten when he met Elvis Presley. In the summer of 1961, his uncle was working on the set of Presley's film \"Follow That Dream\", in nearby Ocala, and invited Petty to watch the shoot. He instantly became a Presley fan, and when he returned that Saturday, he was greeted by his friend Keith Harben, and soon traded his Wham-O slingshot for a collection of Elvis 45s. Of that meeting with Presley, Petty said, \"Elvis glowed.\"\nIn a 2006 interview, Petty said he knew he wanted to be in a band the moment he saw the Beatles on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". \"The minute I saw the Beatles on the \"Ed Sullivan Show\"—and it's true of thousands of guys—there was the way out. There was the way to do it. You get your friends and you're a self-contained unit. And you make the music. And it looked like so much fun. It was something I identified with. I had never been hugely into sports. ... I had been a big fan of Elvis. But I really saw in the Beatles that here's something I could do. I knew I could do it. It wasn't long before there were groups springing up in garages all over the place.\" He dropped out of high school at age 17 to play bass with his newly formed band.\n\nIn an interview with the CBC in 2014, Petty stated that the Rolling Stones were \"my punk music\". He credited the group with inspiring him by demonstrating that he and musicians like him could make it in rock and roll.\n\nOne of his first guitar teachers was Don Felder, a fellow Gainesville resident, who later joined the Eagles. As a young man, Petty worked briefly on the grounds crew of the University of Florida, but never attended as a student. An Ogeechee lime tree that he allegedly planted while employed at the university is now called the Tom Petty tree (Petty stated that he did not recall planting any trees). He also worked briefly as a gravedigger.\n\nPetty also overcame a difficult relationship with his father, who found it hard to accept that his son was \"a mild-mannered kid who was interested in the arts\" and subjected him to verbal and physical abuse on a regular basis. Petty was close to his mother and remained close to his brother, Bruce.\n\nShortly after embracing his musical aspirations, Petty started a band known as the Epics, later to evolve into Mudcrutch. The band included future Heartbreakers Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench and was popular in Gainesville, but their recordings went unnoticed by a mainstream audience. Their only single, \"Depot Street\", released in 1975 by Shelter Records, failed to chart.\n\nAfter Mudcrutch split up, Petty reluctantly agreed to pursue a solo career. Tench decided to form his own group, whose sound Petty appreciated. Eventually, Petty and Campbell collaborated with Tench, Ron Blair and Stan Lynch, forming the first lineup of the Heartbreakers. Their eponymous debut album gained minute popularity amongst American audiences, achieving greater success in Britain. The single \"Breakdown\" was re-released in 1977, and peaked at in early 1978 after the band toured in the United Kingdom in support of Nils Lofgren. The debut album was released by Shelter Records, which at that time was distributed by ABC Records.\nTheir second album, \"You're Gonna Get It!\", was the band's first Top 40 album, featuring the singles \"I Need to Know\" and \"Listen to Her Heart\". Their third album, \"Damn the Torpedoes\", quickly went platinum, selling nearly two million copies; it includes their breakthrough singles \"Don't Do Me Like That\", \"Here Comes My Girl\" and \"Refugee\".\n\nIn September 1979, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed at a Musicians United for Safe Energy concert at Madison Square Garden in New York. Their rendition of \"Cry to Me\" was featured on the resulting album, \"No Nukes\".\n\nThe 4th album \"Hard Promises\", released in 1981, became a top-ten hit, going platinum and spawning the hit single \"The Waiting\". The album also featured Petty's first duet, \"Insider\" with Stevie Nicks.\n\nBass player Ron Blair quit the group and was replaced on the fifth album, \"Long After Dark\" (1982), by Howie Epstein; the resulting lineup lasted until 1994. In 1985, the band participated in Live Aid, playing four songs at John F. Kennedy Stadium, in Philadelphia. \"Southern Accents\" was also released in 1985. This album included the hit single \"Don't Come Around Here No More\", which was produced by Dave Stewart. The song's video featured Petty dressed as the Mad Hatter, mocking and chasing Alice from the book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", then cutting and eating her as if she were a cake. The ensuing tour led to the live album \"\" and an invitation from Bob Dylan—Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers joined him on his True Confessions Tour. They also played some dates with the Grateful Dead in 1986 and 1987. Also in 1987, the group released \"Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)\" which includes \"Jammin' Me\" which Petty wrote with Dylan.\n\nIn 1988, Petty joined George Harrison's group, the Traveling Wilburys, which also included Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne. The band's first song, \"Handle with Care\", was intended as a B-side of one of Harrison's singles, but was judged too good for that purpose and the group decided to record a full album, \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\". A second Wilburys album, mischievously titled \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3\" and recorded without the recently deceased Orbison, followed in 1990. The album was named \"Vol. 3\" as a response to a series of bootlegged studio sessions being sold as \"Travelling Wilburys Vol. 2\". Petty incorporated Traveling Wilburys songs into his live shows, consistently playing \"Handle with Care\" in shows from 2003 to 2006, and for his 2008 tour adding \"surprises\" such as \"End of the Line\" to the set list.\n\nIn 1989, Petty released \"Full Moon Fever\", which featured hits \"I Won't Back Down\", \"Free Fallin'\" and \"Runnin' Down a Dream\". It was nominally his first solo album, although several Heartbreakers and other well-known musicians participated: Mike Campbell co-produced the album with Petty and Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, and backing musicians included Campbell, Lynne, and fellow Wilburys Roy Orbison and George Harrison (Ringo Starr appears on drums in the video for \"I Won't Back Down\", but they were actually performed by Phil Jones).\n\nPetty and the Heartbreakers reformed in 1991 and released \"Into the Great Wide Open\", which was co-produced by Lynne and included the hit singles \"Learning To Fly\" and \"Into the Great Wide Open\", the latter featuring Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway in the music video.\n\nBefore leaving MCA Records, Petty and the Heartbreakers got together to record, live in the studio, two new songs for a \"Greatest Hits\" package: \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\" and Thunderclap Newman's \"Something in the Air\". This was Stan Lynch's last recorded performance with the Heartbreakers. Petty commented \"He left right after the session without really saying goodbye.\" The package went on to sell over ten million copies, therefore receiving diamond certification by the RIAA.\n\nIn 1989, while still under contract to MCA, Petty secretly signed a lucrative deal with Warner Bros. Records, to which the Traveling Wilburys had been signed. His first album on his new label, 1994's \"Wildflowers\" (Petty's second of three solo albums), included the singles \"You Don't Know How It Feels\", \"You Wreck Me\", \"It's Good to Be King\", and \"A Higher Place\". The album, produced by Rick Rubin, sold over three million copies in the United States.\n\nIn 1996, Petty, with the Heartbreakers, released a soundtrack to the movie \"She's the One\", starring Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston (see \"Songs and Music from \"She's the One\"\"). The album's singles were \"Walls (Circus)\" (featuring Lindsey Buckingham), \"Climb that Hill\", and a song written by Lucinda Williams, \"Change the Locks\". The album also included a cover of \"Asshole\", a song by Beck. The same year, the band accompanied Johnny Cash on \"Unchained\" (provisionally entitled \"Petty Cash\"), for which Cash would win a Grammy for Best Country Album (Cash would later cover Petty's \"I Won't Back Down\" on \"\").\nIn 1999, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released their last album with Rubin at the helm, \"Echo\". Two songs were released as singles in the U.S., \"Room at the Top\" and \"Free Girl Now\". The album reached number 10 in the U.S. album charts.\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers played \"I Won't Back Down\" at the benefit concert for victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The following year, they played \"Taxman\", \"I Need You\" and \"Handle with Care\" (joined for the last by Jeff Lynne, Dhani Harrison, and Jim Keltner) at the \"Concert for George\" in honor of Petty's friend and former bandmate George Harrison.\n\nPetty's 2002 release, \"The Last DJ\", was an album-length critique of the practices within the music industry. The title track, inspired by Los Angeles radio personality Jim Ladd, bemoaned the end of the freedom that radio DJs once had to personally select songs for their station's playlists. The album peaked at number nine on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart in the United States.\n\nIn 2005, Petty began hosting his own show \"Buried Treasure\" on XM Satellite Radio, on which he shared selections from his personal record collection.\nIn 2006, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers headlined the fifth annual Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival as part of their \"30th Anniversary Tour\". Special guests included Stevie Nicks, Pearl Jam, the Allman Brothers Band, Trey Anastasio, the Derek Trucks Band, and the Black Crowes. Nicks joined Petty and the Heartbreakers on stage for \"a selection of songs\" including \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\".\n\nIn July 2006, Petty released a solo album titled \"Highway Companion\", which included the hit \"Saving Grace\". It debuted at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200, which was Petty's highest chart position since the introduction of the Nielsen SoundScan system for tracking album sales in 1991. \"Highway Companion\" was briefly promoted on the tour with the Heartbreakers in 2006, with performances of \"Saving Grace\", \"Square One\", \"Down South\" and \"Flirting with Time\".\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, Petty reunited with his old bandmates Tom Leadon and Randall Marsh along with Heartbreakers Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell to reform his pre-Heartbreakers band Mudcrutch. The band originally formed in 1970 in Gainesville, Florida, before relocating to California where they released one single in 1975 before breaking up. The quintet recorded an album of 14 songs that was released on April 29, 2008 (on iTunes, an additional song \"Special Place\" was available if the album was pre-ordered). The band supported the album with a brief tour of California in the spring of 2008.\nIn 2007, Petty and the Heartbreakers’ contributed a cover of \"I'm Walkin'\" to the album \"\". The album's sales helped buy instruments for students in New Orleans public schools and they contributed to the building of a community center in the city's Hurricane Katrina-damaged Ninth Ward.\n\nOn February 3, 2008, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed during the halftime-show of Super Bowl XLII at the University of Phoenix Stadium. They played \"American Girl\", \"I Won't Back Down\", \"Free Fallin'\" and \"Runnin' Down a Dream\". That summer, the band toured North America with Steve Winwood as the opening act. Winwood joined Petty and the Heartbreakers on stage at select shows and performed his Spencer Davis Group hit \"Gimme Some Lovin'\", and occasionally he performed his Blind Faith hit \"Can't Find My Way Home\". In November 2009 the boxed set \"The Live Anthology\", a compilation of live recordings from 1978 to 2006, was released.\n\nThe band's twelfth album \"Mojo\" was released on June 15, 2010, and reached number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart. Petty described the album as \"Blues-based. Some of the tunes are longer, more jam-y kind of music. A couple of tracks really sound like the Allman Brothers—not the songs but the atmosphere of the band.\" To promote the record, the band appeared as the musical guests on \"Saturday Night Live\" on May 15, 2010. The release of \"Mojo\" was followed by a North American summer tour. Prior to the tour, five of the band's guitars, including two owned by Petty, were stolen from their practice space in Culver City, California in April 2010. The items were recovered by Los Angeles police the next week.\n\nIn 2012, the band went on a world tour that included their first European dates in 20 years and their first ever concerts in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nOn July 29, 2014, Reprise Records released Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' thirteenth studio album, \"Hypnotic Eye\". The album debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, becoming the first Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album to ever top the chart. On November 20, 2015, the Tom Petty Radio channel debuted on SiriusXM.\n\nIn 2017, the Heartbreakers embarked on a 40th Anniversary Tour of the United States. The tour began on April 20 in Oklahoma City and ended on September 25 with a performance at the Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood, California. The Hollywood Bowl concert, which would ultimately be the Heartbreakers' final show, ended with a performance of \"American Girl\".\n\nOn September 28, 2018, Reprise Records released \"An American Treasure\", a 60-track career-spanning box set featuring dozens of previously unreleased recordings, alternate versions of classic songs, rarities, historic live performances and deep tracks. The box set was preceded by the first single, \"Keep A Little Soul\", in July 2018. The song is an unreleased outtake originally recorded in 1982 during the \"Long After Dark\" sessions.\n\nPetty's first appearance in film took place in 1978, when he had a cameo in \"FM\". He later had a small part in 1987's \"Made in Heaven\" and appeared in several episodes of \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\" between 1987 and 1990, playing himself as one of Garry Shandling's neighbors. Petty was also featured in Shandling's other show, \"The Larry Sanders Show\", as one of the Story within a story final guests. In the episode, Petty gets bumped from the show and nearly comes to blows with Greg Kinnear.\n\nPetty appeared in the 1997 film \"The Postman\", directed by and starring Kevin Costner, as the Bridge City Mayor (from the dialogue it is implied that he is playing a future history version of himself). In 2002, he appeared on \"The Simpsons\" in the episode \"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\", along with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Lenny Kravitz, Elvis Costello, and Brian Setzer. In it, Petty spoofed himself as a tutor to Homer Simpson on the art of lyric writing, composing a brief song about a drunk girl driving down the road while concerned with the state of public schools. Later in the episode, he loses a toe during a riot.\n\nPetty had a recurring role as the voice of Elroy \"Lucky\" Kleinschmidt in the animated comedy series \"King of the Hill\" from 2004 to 2009. In 2010, Petty made a five-second cameo appearance with comedian Andy Samberg in a musical video titled \"Great Day\" featured on the bonus DVD as part of The Lonely Island's new album \"Turtleneck & Chain\".\n\nPetty was known as a staunch guardian of his artistic control and artistic freedom. In 1979, he was involved in a legal dispute when ABC Records was sold to MCA Records. He refused to be transferred to another record label without his consent. In May 1979, he filed for bankruptcy and was signed to the new MCA subsidiary Backstreet Records.\n\nIn early 1981, the upcoming Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album, which would become \"Hard Promises\", was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of $9.98, following Steely Dan's \"Gaucho\" and the Olivia Newton-John/Electric Light Orchestra \"Xanadu\" soundtrack. This so-called \"superstar pricing\" was $1.00 more than the usual list price of $8.98. Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Non-delivery of the album and naming it \"Eight Ninety-Eight\" were considered, but eventually MCA decided against the price increase.\n\nIn 1987, Petty sued tire company B.F. Goodrich for $1 million for using a song very similar to his song \"Mary's New Car\" in a TV commercial. The ad agency that produced the commercial had previously sought permission to use Petty's song but was refused. A judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting further use of the ad and the suit was later settled out of court.\n\nSome have claimed that the Red Hot Chili Peppers single \"Dani California\", released in May 2006, is very similar to Petty's \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\". Petty told \"Rolling Stone Magazine\", \"I seriously doubt that there is any negative intent there. And a lot of rock 'n' roll songs sound alike. Ask Chuck Berry. The Strokes took 'American Girl' for their song 'Last Nite', and I saw an interview with them where they actually admitted it. That made me laugh out loud. I was like, 'OK, good for you' ... If someone took my song note for note and stole it maliciously, then maybe <nowiki>[I'd sue]</nowiki>. But I don't believe in lawsuits much. I think there are enough frivolous lawsuits in this country without people fighting over pop songs.\"\n\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that Petty and Jeff Lynne would receive royalties from Sam Smith's song \"Stay with Me\" after its writers acknowledged similarities between it and \"I Won't Back Down\". Petty and co-composer Lynne were awarded 12.5% of the royalties from \"Stay with Me\", and their names were added to the ASCAP song credit. Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying, \"All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by. Sam's people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement\".\n\nPetty married Jane Benyo in 1974, and they divorced in 1996. Benyo once told mutual friend Stevie Nicks that she had met Petty at \"the age of seventeen\". Nicks misheard Benyo's North Florida accent, inspiring the title of her song \"Edge of Seventeen\". Petty and Benyo had two daughters: Adria, a director, and AnnaKim, an artist. In 2015, Petty publicly disclosed that he had struggled with heroin addiction following the end of his first marriage. Petty married Dana York on June 3, 2001, and had a stepson, Dylan, from York's earlier marriage.\n\nIn May 1987, an arsonist set fire to Petty's house in Encino, California. Firefighters were able to salvage the basement recording studio and the original tapes stored there, as well as his Gibson Dove acoustic guitar. His signature gray top hat, however, was destroyed. Petty later rebuilt the house with fire-resistant materials.\n\nPetty spoke in 2014 of the benefits from his practice of Transcendental Meditation.\n\nPetty was found unconscious at his home, not breathing and in full cardiac arrest, early in the morning of October 2, 2017. He was resuscitated and taken to the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, where he died at 8:40 pm PDT.\n\nAfter reports of Petty's hospitalization, premature reports of his death spread quickly and widely, and without official denial or confirmation, continued throughout the day until the band's management issued official confirmation shortly after Petty's actual death Monday evening. While the official announcement said Petty collapsed early Monday morning, original reports claimed the incident happened Sunday night.\n\nOn October 16, 2017, a memorial service was held at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades.\n\nOn January 19, 2018, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner announced that Petty had died accidentally from mixed drug toxicity, a combination of fentanyl, oxycodone, acetylfentanyl and despropionyl fentanyl (all opioids); temazepam and alprazolam (both sedatives); and citalopram (an antidepressant).\n\nIn a statement on his official website, Petty's wife and daughter said he had multiple medical problems, including emphysema, knee difficulties \"and most significantly a fractured hip\". He was prescribed pain medication for these issues and informed on the day of his death that his fractured hip had graduated to a full break. The statement read, \"[it] is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication.[..] We feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident\".\n\nOn September 28, 2018, four days before the first anniversary of his death, Petty's wife Dana gave an interview to \"Billboard\" about her husband's death saying that Petty put off hip surgery his doctors had recommended for some time. \"He would do anything to help anyone – his bandmates, the crew, the fans – and that's why he did the last tour with a fractured hip. He was adamant. He found out a few days before the tour was gonna start – and that he had emphysema.\" Dana said that he was relying on drugs on the road to keep his hip pain under control but was looking forward to not needing them anymore. \"That's why he wouldn't go to the hospital when his hip broke. He'd had it in mind it was his last tour and he owed it to his long-time crew, from decades some of them, and his fans.\" Dana said that Petty was in a good mood the day before his death, excited about the future saying, \"He had those three shows in L.A. and the day before he died he was pounding his chest going, 'I'm on top of the world!' Never had he been so proud of himself, so happy, so looking forward to the future – and then he's gone.\"\n\nPetty owned and used a number of guitars over the years. From 1976 to 1982, his main instrument was a sunburst 1964 Fender Stratocaster. He also used a number of Rickenbacker guitars from 1979 onward, notably a 1965 Rose Morris 1993 and 1987 reissue of the Rose Morris 1997, a 1967 360/12 and 1989 660/12TP. The Rickenbacker 660/12TP was designed by Petty (specifically the neck) and featured his signature from 1991 to 1997.\n\nFor acoustic guitars, Petty had a signature C.F. Martin HD-40, and wrote virtually all of his songs on a Gibson Dove acoustic saved from his 1987 house fire. He also used a Gibson J-200 in a natural finish and a late 1970s Guild D25 12-string acoustic.\n\nPetty's later amplifier setup featured two Fender Vibro-King 60-watt combos.\n\nIn 1994, \"You Got Lucky\", a Petty tribute album featuring such bands as Everclear and Silkworm was released.\n\nIn April 1996, Petty received UCLA's George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement. The next month, Petty won the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers' Golden Note Award.\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999, for their contribution to the recording industry.\n\nIn December 2001, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in New York.\n\nPetty received the \"Billboard\" Century Award, the organization's highest honor for creative achievement, at a ceremony on December 6, 2005, during the \"Billboard\" Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nIn September 2006, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers received the keys to the city of Gainesville, Florida, where he and his bandmates either lived or grew up. From July 2006 until 2007 the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, featured an exhibit of Tom Petty items; much of the content was donated by Petty during a visit to his home by some of the Hall's curatorial staff.\n\nPeter Bogdanovich's documentary film on Petty's career titled \"Runnin' Down a Dream\" premiered at the New York Film Festival in October 2007.\n\nPetty was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year in February 2017 for his contributions to music and for his philanthropy.\n\nIn October 2018, on what would have been the singer's 68th birthday, the city of Gainesville renamed the former Northeast Park, a park where a young Petty had often visited, as Tom Petty Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Supreme is known for wearing a boot as a hat and carrying a large toothbrush, and has said that if elected President of the United States, he will pass a law requiring people to brush their teeth. He has campaigned on a platform of zombie apocalypse awareness and time travel research, and promised a free pony for every American.\n\nIn 2011, he participated in the Occupy Boston protests.\nHe is the subject of the 2014 documentary, \"Who Is Vermin Supreme? An Outsider Odyssey\", which follows his 2012 campaign and explores his life as an activist and political prankster.\n\nSupreme grew up near Boston, Massachusetts and is said to be the oldest of three children. He graduated from Gloucester High School in the 1980s, then moved to Baltimore to attend art school, but he dropped out and began booking bands for underground clubs.\n\nIn 1986, he joined the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament in protest of nuclear weapons. In 1987, he began running for public office. He legally changed his name to Vermin Supreme in the 1990s while still in Baltimore.\n\nIn 2006, Supreme donated one of his kidneys to save his mother. He is married and has no children.\n\nSupreme discussed his political views in a 2008 promotional video. He stated he was registered as a Republican at that time, but that he leaned toward anarchism. He asserted that libertarians \"are just about abolishing the government and letting shit fall where it may,\" which he called a mistake; he also asserted that Republicans want to nullify the government, but \"offer no alternative to helping people other than charity.\" Supreme's vision of anarchism holds no need for government, but depends on citizens to take responsibility for themselves and for others, citing \"mutual aid and support and care to our fellow citizens\" as key elements. To that end, Supreme called for a gradual dismantling of the government, while citizens take up the slack. He asserted that Americans no longer know how to be citizens, placing some of the blame on schools that teach in \"very twisted and jingoistic fashion\".\n\nIn the video, Supreme discussed his presidential campaign. He describes his \"joke humor\" campaign as a response to the lies people are fed by the media and by the government.\n\nSupreme campaigned in the Washington, DC Presidential primary in 2004, where he received 149 votes.\n\nSupreme campaigned in the New Hampshire Republican primary in 2008. He received 41 votes (0.02%) in the New Hampshire primary. According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), he also received 43 votes, nationally, in the general election.\n\nVermin Supreme campaigned as a Democrat in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe following are some of the milestones in this campaign:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupreme attempted another presidential run in 2016. He embarked on a tour of 20 cities to build support for his campaign and sought to qualify for matching funds from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). He filed as a candidate in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary on November 21, 2015, and received 259 votes in the primary on February 9, 2016, coming in fourth after Martin O'Malley. He was not invited to return to the Lesser-Known Democratic Candidates Presidential Forum, due in part to him glitterbombing Randall Terry at the event in 2011. Shortly before the primary, he was observed questioning Republican candidates Chris Christie and Ted Cruz through a bullhorn. On March 4, 2016, he switched his affiliation to the Libertarian Party, claiming his rightful position as Sage and Oracle for Libertarians throughout America, and possibly Belize as well. He received the vote of a single delegate in the first round of presidential nomination voting at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention.\n\nIn December 2017 Hillary Clinton planned to visit Concord, New Hampshire for a book tour promoting her new book \"What Happened\". In advance of her presentation Supreme planned a demonstration in front of the bookstore during the event. The demonstration was to be a \"pony protest\" and include at least one pony. Supreme has a history of making the election promise of ponies to constituents and has asserted that Clinton does not like ponies enough. When Supreme sought a protest permit for his demonstration the police ordered the city to deny his request.\n\nIn response, Supreme asserted his \"right to pony\" and retained Marc Randazza, an attorney with a reputation for advocacy of First Amendment rights, to represent him in suing the city of Concord for the permit. The court found in favor of Supreme issuing an injunction that the city give him a permit, allow him to protest the event, and allow him to bring ponies. A stipulation was that Supreme had to pay for parking for ponies at the rate for cars.\n\nWhen Supreme presented the pony protest there was a parade. More than 1,000 people attended the book signing and protest. Various media sources covered the pony protest and Clinton book tour together. The editors of the school newspaper of Londonderry High School used the event to endorse Supreme in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn March 2018, inspired by several high school and college students (some from out-of-state) running for Governor of Kansas in the midterm election, Supreme stated that \"I certainly did not want to draw away any votes from any teenagers running in the Governor’s race,\" instead opting to run for Attorney General, becoming the sole challenger to incumbent Republican Derek Schmidt. The lack of requirements in order to run for office, as outlined in the state's Constitution, has been heralded by Supreme: \"This is indeed a very interesting and attractive loophole,” he said. “I think that’s a very good thing for democracy.\" Desarae Lindsay of Texas has been named his campaign treasurer.\n\nSupreme co-wrote and stars in the 2009 film \"Vote Jesus: The Chronicles of Ken Stevenson\", in which he poses as a right-wing political candidate to gain access into the world of American fundamentalism.\n\nIn 2012, Supreme starred in a web series entitled \"Learnin' with Vermin\" that uses a fictional version of his presidential campaign as a platform to teach political concepts such as voting methods.\n\nA documentary following Supreme on the 2012 campaign trail and exploring his life and work as an activist and political prankster called \"Who Is Vermin Supreme? An Outsider Odyssey\" was funded through a Kickstarter campaign and premiered at the Minneapolis St. Paul International Film Festival on April 9, 2014.\nThe film was directed by Minneapolis-based filmmaker Steve Onderick and features founder of the Rent is Too Damn High Party, Jimmy McMillan, and Boston-based singer-songwriter and comedian Rob Potylo. The film was released to the general public on Vimeo on Demand on January 30, 2016.\n\nSupreme has also collaborated with performance artist, activist and musician Rob Potylo in the web series \"Quiet Desperation\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2407641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2407641", "title": "Wong Yuk-man", "text": "Wong Yuk-man\n\nRaymond Wong Yuk-man (; born 1 October 1951) is a Hong Kong politician, author, current affairs commentator and radio host. He is a former member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo), representing the geographical constituency of Kowloon West. He worked in Commercial Radio Hong Kong and hosted many popular phone-in programmes.\n\nHe was the head of Department in the Faculty of Communication and Journalism of Chu Hai College in Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong, which he also hold a Master degree in history in there. He is a radical populist and a former chairman of the League of Social Democrats (LSD). He is known for his outspoken manners, his harsh criticism of the Chinese Government, and his ferocious speeches in defence of the rights of the lower classes; consequently, he has been given the nicknames \"Mad Dog\" () and \"Rogue Professor\" (). He currently hosts \"Wong Yuk-man Channel,\" a popular radio programme on MyRadio, which is a Hong Kong-based internet radio station founded in 2007, and as well as Proletariat Political Institute.\n\nWong was born in 1 October 1951 in British Hong Kong with the family root of Lukfung, Kwangtung. Wong's father was a close friend of Heung Chin, a general of Nationalist Party of China and founder of the Sun Yee On , one of the leading triads in Hong Kong. He was under the patronage of the Heung family and was sent aboard to study in Taiwan. After he graduated from the Taiwan-affiliated Chu Hai College with a master's degree in history, Wong worked as a journalist and taught at Chu Hai College.\n\nHe first made his name in the early 1990s when he co-hosted Asia Television's controversial and hugely popular political commentary programme \"News Tease\". He savaged pro-Beijing politicians until the show was axed after 64 episodes in 1994, allegedly under pressure from the mainland authorities.\n\nIn 1990, Wong used his entire savings - HK$500,000 - to launch \"News File\" magazine, but it closed down within two years and left him heavily in debt. On 18 March 1996, he established \"Mad Dog Daily\", a tabloid with a clear \"Anti-communism\" and \"Anti-Tung\" stance. However, the paper suffered from a low sales volume, which Wong jokingly blamed on its \"journalistic integrity\" and refusal to participate in sensationalist journalism. After the Asian financial crisis, it transformed into a magazine in October 1997, and then was suspended shortly afterwards. As a result, Wong had to bear debts that amounted to a total of 15 million HKD. He repaid this debt in a matter of years by working on talk shows and other TV programmes.\n\nIn 2000, Wong established \"CyberHK\", an IT company that was also unsuccessful, falling victim to the dot-com bubble of 2001 and putting Wong into debt again. To settle the debts, Wong concentrated on his radio talk shows, writing articles for newspapers, and running his beef noodle restaurant. His popularity hit a peak by hosting two weekly shows for Commercial Radio Hong Kong; had three weekly slots on Radio Television Hong Kong, both on television and radio; and appeared on prime-time TV at least once a week.\n\nIn 2003, Wong converted to Christianity during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. He was attracted to liberation theology after his contact with the least-privileged in society during the crisis. He was active in mobilising support for the Hong Kong 1 July marches.\n\nIn 2004, he took a sabbatical from his talk show \"Close Encounters of a Political Kind\", after being beaten up by gangsters allegedly paid by the Chinese Government, citing \"political pressure\". Following a self-imposed three-month exile in Canada, he returned to Hong Kong where he was sacked from his weeknight political phone-in radio programme, and moved to a late Saturday night slot (with significantly fewer listeners). In less than a year, the programme was cancelled and Wong was effectively and controversially taken off-air. This event was significant for Hong Kong as it meant that there was no longer any outspoken and critical radio talk show host on any Hong Kong radio station. During his time off-air, he continued to run his beef noodle restaurant in Mongkok.\n\nIn 2006, he co-founded the League of Social Democrats, a self-described social democratic political party which aimed to be a \"clear-cut opposition party\" and defend the interests of the grassroots. In 2007, he made a comeback to phone-in radio talk show, hosting a weekly political radio programme \"Wong Yuk-man Channel\" on MyRadio. The show quickly gained popularity and some videos of his broadcasts – captured by a studio camera and uploaded to YouTube – have become some of the most-watched videos in Hong Kong. \"Wong Yuk-man Channel\" has subsequently become a twice-weekly radio programme, now extended from one hour to 1½ hours. In 2008, he was appointed a trustee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nWong Yuk-man refused to co-operate with the other pan-democratic parties Democratic Party and the Civic Party and strongly criticised the two parties for nominating Alan Leong as Chief Executive candidate in the 2007 election, saying that they are not qualified as democrats. In the 2008 Hong Kong Legislative election, he ran in the Kowloon West constituency on a platform of \"Without struggle there is no change\". During the campaign he lambasted the Civic Party's Claudia Mo Man-ching in the same way he did the candidates from the pro-Beijing, pro-government flagship party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), accusing the Civic Party of applying double standards in its fight for democracy, and being elitist. Wong ultimately gained a seat in the Legislative Council with the second highest number of votes in his constituency. while Mo lost in the election.\n\nWong Yuk-man introduced a number of innovative actions to Hong Kong politics. On 15 October 2008, during Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang's delivery of the Annual Policy Address, Wong and his colleagues Leung Kwok-hung and Albert Chan interrupted Tsang's speech and heckled. Tsang suggested that the HK$625 a month (US$80) Old Age Allowance paid to all senior citizens aged 65 or above be raised to HK$1000 a month (US$130), but with a means test introduced. Wong believed that this turned what was a gesture of respect to elderly people into welfare and is disrespectful to old people. Wong interrupted Tsang's speech and threw a bunch of bananas at him. The three LSD members were ejected from the chamber for the act.\n\nThe incident triggered much debate amongst scholars, commentators, fellow politicians, and the general public. The reception has been mixed with even some pro-democratic politicians condemning the attack. One of the most prominent figures in the pro-democratic camp, Anson Chan, released a formal statement criticising the stunt. On the other hand, the elderly of Hong Kong poured onto the streets in a demonstration of mass support for Wong; some even urged him to do it again. Wong himself has claimed that this controversial move had been successful in raising awareness about the discussion of benefits for the elderly. Indeed, within a week the government raised the \"fruit money\" to HK$1000 a month and dropped the proposal for means testing.\n\nWong caused another uproar when he attempted to snatch the 2009-10 Budget Report midway through reading by the Financial Secretary John Tsang Jun-Wah, saying that it did not address any policies to help lower class and lower middle class citizens in the financial turmoil. Some LegCo members, including several members of the Democratic Party, and the pro-Beijing media together denounced Wong's actions as violent. Wong, however, stated that he did not cause any physical harm to anyone, nor was it his intention to do so. Demonstrators took to the streets in support of Wong and his actions.\n\nDespite criticism, Wong commented that, in contrast to past attitudes, Hong Kong society was conservative and many people did not understand or appreciate his actions. Yet he continued to gain support from a niche of the local population, especially those from the grass-roots, for his relatively radical approach.\n\nIn late-2009 and early 2010, a debate ensued amidst the pro-democracy camp on a more radical approach towards gaining universal suffrage. An agreement was reached between the Civic Party and Wong's League of Social Democrats for five members of their representation in the Legislative Council to resign and participate in a by-election, to create a referendum on the implementation of universal suffrage by 2012. In January 2010, Wong, another four lawmakers, Albert Chan, Tanya Chan, Leung Kwok-hung and Alan Leong resigned and participated in the ensuing by-election. On 16 May 2010, he was re-elected as a lawmaker in the by-election. The turn-out was only 17.7 percent of registered voters. Wong Yuk-man denounced the Democratic Party for negotiating with Beijing and voting for the reform package which he saw as \"selling out democracy\" and defecting to the Communist Party of China. LSD protesters attacked the Democratic Party in the following 2010 July 1 march.\n\nIn January 2010, Wong stepped down as Chairman of the LSD, handing the chairmanship to Andrew To Kwan-hang. In January 2011, Wong and Albert Chan announced that they were resigning from the League of Social Democrats over differences with his successor Andrew To's leadership over what stance to take towards the Democratic Party after Wong Yuk-man's protege Edward Yum failed in passing a no-confidence motion against To. As two of the party's three legislators, the move left the party and the remaining legislator, Leung Kwok-hung ('Long Hair'), in a difficult position. Wong also said that factional fighting within the party has become so hostile that it was beyond his and Chan's ability to rectify the situation. With Chan, he went on to launch People Power, under which name he continued to sit in Legco.\n\nIn the 2011 July 1 march after leading activists on a march from Wan Chai to Central, Wong Yuk-man and Albert Chan organised their supporters to break through a police cordon, occupied a major road in Central and scuffled with the police, bringing traffic to a standstill. Wong and Chan were later arrested for unlawful assembly. They were later convicted in April 2013. Eastern Court magistrate Joseph To Ho-shing accused Wong of being \"untrustworthy\" and lying in a bid to escape the charges. Wong called on his supporters to be \"well-prepared for a long struggle\" against the government and said he feared for the day when local courts would be \"manipulated by the Communist Party.\"\n\nWong decided to challenge the Democratic Party in the 2011 District Council elections. People Power put forward 62 candidates, many of whom ran in constituencies against Democratic Party candidates. The party won just one seat, in Fung Cheung, where the its candidate Johnny Mak Ip-sing did not face another candidate from the pro-democracy camp. Given the poor showing, Albert Chan admitted that the strategy had failed. Nevertheless, he insisted that the party would 'stay the course'.\n\nOn 20 May 2013, Wong Yuk-man announced his resignation from People Power. It was believed to be related to his earlier split with Stephen Shiu Yeuk-yuen, the owner of the Hong Kong Reporter and People Power's financial support over the Occupy Central plan, which he strongly disagreed.\n\nFrom 2013, Wong became increasingly sympathetic to the localist cause. Together with his protege Wong Yeung-tat, they organised memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, as opposed to the main candlelight vigil held by pan-democrats' Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China (HKASPDMC), which they criticised it for having a Chinese nationalistic theme. They organised its alternative 4 June rally in Tsim Sha Tsui. The alternative event attracted 200 people in 2013 and 7,000 in 2014, compared with 180,000 and 150,000 respectively for the main event.\n\nOn 3 July 2014 during a Q&A session of the Legislative Council, Wong was accused of intentionally hurting Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying by hurling a glass at him in a protest. Wong was charged of common assault. He claimed that he was first intentionally throwing papers towards a location where no one was standing, and he switched to throwing water only when there were not many documents left on the table. He said the glass was released accidentally as security guards were pulling him back. He was later convicted on 19 October 2016.\n\nOn 27 September 2018, Wong Yuk-man's assault conviction for hurling glass at Leung Chun-ying is overturned.\n\nIn the 2016 Legislative Council election, he ran a campaign with militant localist group Civic Passion and Chin Wan to promote their political platform in amending the Basic Law to achieve full autonomy for Hong Kong. He was under attack by his former supporter Ho Chi-kwong, who accused him of his \"unethical\" political past. He received an unexpected loss, losing to Yau Wai-ching from the localist Youngspiration by only 424 votes. He blamed his failure on making \"too many enemies in his political career\" and \"not enough effort\". He said he would focus on developing the online radio station My Radio.\n\nOn 14 April 2017, Wong announced his intention to quit politics, not taking part in political affairs, not participating or organising any political groups, and not joining any elections.\n\nDuring the outbreak of SARS in 2003, Wong became a Christian and baptized in 2008. He helped Media Evangelism Limited, a Christian media organisation in Hong Kong, advertise its films and programmes. In 2006, Wong recorded songs with the Amazing Grace Worship Music Ministry.\n\nHowever, soon as he expressed his liberal views, many mainstream Protestant churches criticize his position on gay rights. Wong support laws to protect discrimination against gays. He advocated gays should be protected from domestic violence, which was criticised by evangelical churches. He referred to the Society for Truth and Light, a conservative Christian right organisation, as a \"terrorist organisation,\" and said many of its activities were \"nonsense\", promoting the \"Talibanization\" of Hong Kong. He was a guest of the International Day Against Homophobia protest in Hong Kong on 21 May 2009.\n\n\n\n"}
