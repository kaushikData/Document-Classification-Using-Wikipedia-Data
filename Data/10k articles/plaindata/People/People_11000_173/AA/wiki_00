She assisted in founding and led several nationally known societies for social reform during and following the Civil War.\n\nShe grew up in Philadelphia in a Quaker family; her father, Isaac Hopper, opposed slavery and aided fugitive slaves. She grew to share her father's beliefs and spent much of her life working for social reform in several fields. In 1841, the New York Monthly Meeting disowned Gibbons' father and husband for their anti-slavery writing. Abigail Gibbons resigned the following year, also removing her minor children.\n\nGibbons was prominent during and after the American Civil War, when her work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; and New York City, New York included civil rights and education for blacks, prison reform for women, medical care for Union officers during the war, aid to veterans returning from the war, to help them find work; and welfare. Because she was a known abolitionist, her house was among those attacked and destroyed during the New York City draft riots of July 1863.\n\nAbigail Hopper was born in Philadelphia in 1801, the third of ten children. She was informally called Abby. Both of her parents were proud abolitionists. Her father, Isaac Tatem Hopper, was of the Hicksite branch of Quakers. Her mother, Sarah Tatum Hopper, became a recommended minister for the Society of Friends and oversaw schools for black children along with a committee.\n\nHer father became an active and leading member of The Pennsylvania Abolition Society. He often directly confronted slave kidnappers, who frequented Philadelphia and sometimes kidnapped free blacks for sale into slavery, as well as captured fugitive slaves to gain bounties. Called upon to protect the rights of African Americans, Isaac Hopper and his wife garnered a reputation as friends and advisers of the \"oppressed race\" in all emergencies. The Hoppers also sheltered many poor Quakers in their house, despite their own family's large size and the father's unstable financial status. The children early on were called to aid others.\n\nBoth of Hopper's parents came from historically Quaker families and passed Quaker beliefs down to their children. Hopper further practiced these beliefs by attending Friends' schools growing up. In 1821, she also founded a school that practiced Quaker beliefs. Later, in 1830, Hopper moved to New York and became a teacher at a Quaker school. \n\nAbigail grew up to share her parents' abolitionist sentiments. She worked with well-known abolitionists of her time, including Lydia Maria Child, Sarah Moore Grimké, William Lloyd Garrison, and Theodore Dwight Weld. Though it was a predominantly black organization, Hopper joined the Manhattan Anti-Slavery Society in 1841. This organization protested all-white memberships of other societies, including the Ladies' New York City Anti-Slavery Society. \n\nOn February 14, 1833, Abigail Hopper married James Sloan Gibbons, a fellow Hicksite Quaker from New York, who was also an ardent abolitionist. In 1836, the couple moved to New York City, where they had six children -- William, Sarah, Julia, Lucy, Isaac, and James. Two of their sons, Isaac and James, died in infancy. A third died suddenly after an accident while he was attending Harvard University. Their daughters included Sarah Emerson Gibbons, who published an edited collection of her mother's letters and a short biography of her, and Lucy Gibbons (who married a Mr. Morse and had a family).\n\nSome Quaker yearly meetings divided due to influences from Deism, as well as differences between urban and rural members. In 1841, the New York Monthly Meeting, which was dominated by Hicksites, disowned Isaac Hopper, her father, and James Sloan Gibbons, her husband, for their writing and other activities against slavery. The following year Abigail Hopper Gibbons resigned from the Meeting in protest, also removing her and James' four minor children. She and her family maintained Quaker practices and faith but did not rejoin the Meeting.\n\nAbigail Hopper Gibbons became involved in a variety of social reform movements. For twelve years in New York, she was also president of a German industrial school for street children. In 1845, she and her father founded the Women's Prison Association (WPA) of New York City. She lobbied the city government for improvements in the city's prisons, advocated the hiring of police matrons, and urged the construction of separate prisons for women, as they were housed in the same facilities as men. She frequently visited the various prisons in and about New York.\n\nUnder her leadership, in 1853 the Women's Prison Association separated from its parent, the Prison Association, and Gibbons obtained a New York State charter for her group. She led an aggressive program of legislative lobbying at the city and state level to improve prison conditions for women. She protested jail overcrowding and demanded that women prisoners be searched only by female matrons. She also believed that it would be beneficial for her proposed female prisons to be run by women as well. \n\nWith the outbreak of the American Civil War, Gibbons knew that nurses would be needed to care for the wounded. The United States Sanitary Commission was established in 1861, shortly after the Civil War began, to recruit nurses and to provide adequate medical care to the Union wounded. It would undertake numerous fundraising efforts to raise money for these purposes. When the Commission set up a training base at David's Island Hospital in New York, Gibbons was among the trainees. She worked closely with contraband slaves who supported the Union's effort. These formerly enslaved people had often escaped from the South and sought refuge with the Union. Hopper helped them with childbirth and any other familial issues. She also collected donations from those in the North and gave them to the contraband slaves. Additionally, she used her wages to help pay for medical expenses encountered by patients who resided in a contraband camp. \n\nShe traveled to Washington D.C., to help at the Washington Office Hospital, where she aided wounded officers and distributed supplies. She also helped to establish two field hospitals in Virginia. At Point Lookout, Maryland, the federal government took over a hotel and 100 guest cottages, converting them into a hospital complex with accommodations for 1500 soldiers. It was named Hammond General Hospital. Gibbons vied with Dorothea Dix, the Union Superintendent of Nurses, for control of the hospital. She finally gained an appointment as its head matron. In 1863 she left the facility after the hospital was adapted for use as the Point Lookout Confederate Prison.\n\nIn New York City, social tensions increased with the imposition of the draft. Many Irish immigrant working men did not support the war or abolition of slavery; they resented being drafted when wealthier men could pay for substitutes to take their places. With the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, they feared more job competition by blacks and the loss of work or being driven to lower wages. During the New York Draft Riots, ethnic Irish led mob attacks against individual blacks, their residences and businesses, as well as the Colored Orphan Asylum in the largest civil insurrection in United States history. They also attacked residences of known white abolitionists and prominent Republicans. On Tuesday, July 14, 1863, the Gibbons' Manhattan home at 19 Lamartine Place (now 339 West 29th Street) was burned and destroyed by rioters.\n\nFollowing the war, Gibbons founded the Labor and Aid Society, which aided returning veterans find work. To further her mission with women prisoners, she co-founded The Isaac T. Hopper Home, named for her father. It assisted former women prisoners to integrate into society after their release. As a result of her working on notable social reform movements, Gibbons corresponded with other nationally prominent leaders, including Theodore Roosevelt, Lydia Maria Child, and Joseph H. Choate.\n\nHer concern for women and children led Gibbons to found the New York Diet Kitchen (to serve infants, the elderly and the poor). She had also served as president of the New York Committee for the Prevention and Regulation of Vice, directed to control prostitution, drinking and gambling.\n\nGibbons died of pneumonia in New York in 1893, aged 91. She was eulogized in her obituary as \"one of the most remarkable women of the century\" for her work in noted reform movements. She is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\n\n"}

Arthur Garner was articled to Charles J. Phipps, the architect, whose connection was largely theatrical, he having erected no less than forty English theatres; from which circumstance may perhaps be traced the young pupil's gravitation to the stage, where he became a \"protégé\" of Mr. George Gordon, the scenic artist. From the paint-room Garner soon found his way to the footlights, and for some time appeared in various provincial companies.\n\nIn 1873 Garner arrived in Melbourne, returning to London in 1876. In 1879 Garner began his career as an Australian entrepreneur by taking out \"The London Comedy Company\" (1879), of which Fred Marshall was the bright particular comic star and Mr. George Gordon the hardly less indispensable scenic artist. Garner opened Garner's Theatre (previously White's Rooms) in Adelaide in 1880.\nIn 1881 Garner joined J. C. Williamson, the eminent Australian-American actor, and George Musgrove in establishing the leading firm of Australasian managers, generally known as the \"Trio,\" which has controlled a greater number of theatres and entered into engagements, dramatic and operatic, on a larger scale than has ever been attempted in the southern hemisphere. Their operations practically commenced at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, on July 1, 1882, with the production of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Patience\". Many eminent London \"artistes\" were introduced to the colonies under their regime; but the most substantial undertaking of Williamson, Garner & Musgrove was the building of the new Princess's Theatre, Melbourne, in 1886, regarded as one of the finest theatres in the world.\n\nGarner was twice married: first, to the noted English actress Blanche Stammers, who died in Melbourne in 1883; and, secondly, to Letitia Hill Martin, sister of Patchett Martin, herself an accomplished \"littérateur\", and formerly a contributor to the Australian press.\n\nThey retired to England, living at 36 Kempshott-road, Streatham Common, Surrey.

He was convicted of war crimes by the Polish government following the war and executed in 1948.\n\nLiebehenschel was born in Posen (now Poznań). He studied economics and public administration. Too young to serve in World War I, in 1919 he was in the Freikorps \"Grenzschutz Ost\"; he served as a sergeant major in the German Reichswehr afterwards. In 1932, he joined the Nazi Party, and in 1934 was joined the SS, where he served in the \"Totenkopfverbände\". Liebehenschel became the adjutant in the Lichtenburg concentration camp, and two years later was transferred to the inspectorate of the concentration camps in Berlin. In 1942, when the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office was founded, Liebehenschel was assigned to the new Amtsgruppe D (Concentration Camps) as head of Office D I (Central Office).\n\nOn 1 December 1943 Liebehenschel was appointed commandant of Auschwitz I concentration camp, succeeding Rudolf Höß, and adjutant Robert Mulka. While continuing mass executions, he made also minor \"improvements\" including removing the standing cells and halting the selections to gas chambers among regular prisoners. According to Hermann Langbein, a prisoner at Auschwitz infirmary, \"in general one could establish that even those SS members who were very bloodthirsty before became a bit more reserved because they realized that their fanaticism would not necessarily be tolerated anymore.\" \n\nWhen Höß returned to Auschwitz, Liebehenschel was replaced as commandant on 8 May 1944, and appointed commandant of the already emptied Majdanek camp on 19 May 1944, succeeding Martin Gottfried Weiss. The camp was evacuated because of the Soviet advance into German-occupied Poland. Liebehenschel relocated to Trieste, Italy to the office of Odilo Globocnik, \"Höhere SS- und Polizeiführer\" (HSSPF) for Operational Zone Adriatic Coast (OZAK). Liebehenschel became head of the SS Manpower Office there.\n\nAt the war's end, Liebehenschel was arrested by the U.S. Army and was extradited to Poland. After being convicted of crimes against humanity at the Auschwitz Trial in Kraków, he was sentenced to death and subsequently executed by hanging on 24 January 1948.\n\nLiebehenschel had one son and three daughters by his first wife, Gertrud, the youngest of whom, Barbara Cherish (born 1943), now lives in the United States. \n\nIn 2009, she published \"My father, the Auschwitz commandant\", in which she outlined actions by Liebehenschel that improved the prisoners' lives, but also discussed his participation in a genocidal system. Together with another daughter, Antje, she was interviewed in 2002 in ZDF about living with their father's guilt. Liebehenschel had a son by his second wife, Anneliese. Liebehenschel's first wife, whom he left during the war, suffered from mental health issues after the war and committed suicide in a hospital for the mentally ill in 1966.\n"}

{"id": "2950356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2950356", "title": "Bobbi Campbell", "text": "Bobbi Campbell\n\nRobert Boyle \"Bobbi\" Campbell Jr. (January 28, 1952 – August 15, 1984) was a public health nurse and an early United States AIDS activist. In September 1981, Campbell became the 16th person in San Francisco to be diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, when that was a proxy for an AIDS diagnosis. He was the first to come out publicly as a person with what came to be known as AIDS, writing a regular column in the \"San Francisco Sentinel\", syndicated nationwide, describing his experiences and posting photos of his KS lesions to help other San Franciscans know what to look for, as well as helping write the first San Francisco safer sex manual.\n\nHe rapidly became one of the leading activists co-founding People With AIDS San Francisco in 1982 and then, the following year, with HIV+ men from across the U.S., he co-wrote the Denver Principles, the defining manifesto of the People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement. Appearing on the cover of \"Newsweek\" and being interviewed on national news reports, Campbell raised the national profile of the AIDS crisis among heterosexuals and provided a recognizable face of the epidemic for affected communities. He also lobbied Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Reagan administration over both practical issues and stigmatising medical practices affecting people with AIDS. He also continued to campaign for LGBT+ rights, speaking outside the 1984 Democratic National Convention a month before his death from cryptosporidiosis.\n\nBorn in Georgia in 1952 and raised in Tacoma, Washington, Bobbi Campbell earned a degree in nursing from the University of Washington and volunteered at The Seattle Counseling Services for Sexual Minorities, the first gay-run counseling service for gay people in the country, while being politically active in Seattle during the city's initial wave of gay liberation in the 1970s. He lived communally in Capitol Hill with other gay male activists at what was known informally as the \"East John Street Gay Men's Collective\", described by his former lover Tom Richards as \"a notorious and famous house with colorful and smart people.\"\n\nCampbell moved from Seattle to San Francisco in 1975, getting a job in a hospital near The Castro and immersing himself in the political and social life of the community, which had become a center for the LGBT community over the previous few years. By 1981, he had enrolled in a training program at University of California, San Francisco, to become an adult health nurse practitioner, with a view to focusing on healthcare in the gay and lesbian community.\n\nStarting with a case of shingles in February 1981, Bobbi Campbell suffered a succession of unusual illnesses, including leukopenia later that summer. After hiking the Pinnacles National Monument with his boyfriend in September that year, he noticed on his feet lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), then thought of as a rare cancer of elderly Jewish men but with alarming numbers of cases appearing in California and New York and now known to be closely associated with AIDS. He was formally diagnosed as having KS by dermatologist Marcus Conant on October 8, 1981. This would become Conant's first diagnosis of a patient with what would become known as AIDS; Campbell brought Conant a rose every year to commemorate the anniversary of his diagnosis.\n\nWhile the \"New York Native\" was printing several stories about the \"gay cancer\" beginning to make its way round the city, with detailed medical writing by Lawrence D. Mass, a gay physician and psychiatrist, the San Francisco gay press largely ignored the nascent epidemic. Campbell's interest in educational outreach and professional interest in gay sexual health combined to inspire him to raise awareness himself. As a result, in October 1981, the same month he was diagnosed, Campbell put pictures of his KS lesions in the window of the Star Pharmacy at 498 Castro Street, urging men with similar lesions to seek medical attention. In doing so, he created and displayed San Francisco's first AIDS poster.\n\nAfter speaking with Randy Alfred, a friend and editor of the \"San Francisco Sentinel\", Campbell agreed to write a column, \"to demystify the AIDS story\". In his first article, on December 10, 1981, he proclaimed himself to be the \"KS Poster Boy\" (later \"AIDS Poster Boy\"), becoming the first person in the US to publicly disclose that he was suffering from \"gay cancer\", writing:\nThis article turned into a regular column in the \"Sentinel\" — and syndicated in newspapers serving the LGBT community nationwide — describing his experiences. On January 10, 1982, Campbell was interviewed by Alfred for \"The Gay Life\" program on KSAN-FM, with doctors Marcus Conant and Paul Volberding; the interview has been archived by the GLBT Historical Society.\n\nCampbell joined the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence at the time of the health crisis in early 1982; in his \"sister\" persona as Sister Florence Nightmare RN, he co-authored the first San Francisco safer sex manual, \"Play Fair!\", written in plain sex-positive language, using humor to leaven practical advice. The Sisters were early awareness and fundraisers for the oncoming AIDS pandemic and continue to raise awareness of sexual health; many Orders regularly pass out condoms and participate in events to educate people on sexual health issues.\n\nIn February 1982, on the invitation of Conant and Volberding, Campbell and Dan Turner, who had just himself been diagnosed with KS, attended what turned out to be the founding meeting of the KS/AIDS Foundation, which later became the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, of which Campbell then served on the board. Campbell also became involved with the Shanti Project (which moved from its original focus, supporting people with terminal cancer, to help provide emotional support to people diagnosed with AIDS coming to terms with death) and persuaded reluctant physicians to allow him to meet and counsel AIDS patients at Conant's KS clinic.\n\nIn 1982, Campbell and Turner convened a meeting that spawned People With AIDS San Francisco, founding the \"People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement\" or PWA Movement, rapidly followed by Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz, authors of \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\", in New York City. As well as arguing that people with AIDS should expect to participate actively in the response to the AIDS crisis, the PWA Movement rejected the terms \"AIDS victim\" and \"AIDS patient,\" as Campbell explained in interviews, for example:\n\nWith other members of People With AIDS San Francisco, Campbell organized the first candlelight march to bring attention to the plight of people with AIDS and to remember those who had died of AIDS. On May 2, 1983, they marched behind a banner of \"Fighting for our lives\" for the first time, drawing around 10,000 people. On May 23, 1983, People With AIDS San Francisco voted to send Campbell and Turner to the Fifth National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference, at which the Second National AIDS Forum would be held.\n\nCampbell and his colleagues' push to persuade service organizations to sponsor gay men with AIDS to attend the Conference was a key moment in the People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement. Michael Callen subsequently wrote that, despite a growing sense of being patronised, it had not occurred to the AIDS-diagnosed New Yorkers to \"be anything more than the passive recipients of the genuine care and concern\"; once people with AIDS realised they could advocate for themselves, lessons learned from the feminist and the civil rights movement helped with a more-widespread acceptance of the notion of self-empowerment.\n\nThe national PWA movement came fully together when Campbell took charge of a discussion where, with Callen, Turner and others, he drafted the Denver Principles, the defining manifesto of the PWA Movement, which, again, start with the rejection of the terms \"victim\" and \"patient.\" Campbell and the San Franciscans had different thoughts on the origin (etiology) of AIDS from Callen and the New Yorkers — Campbell described as \"crazy\" the idea that AIDS was caused by promiscuity, a perspective espoused by Callen and Berkowitz (and their physician Joseph Sonnabend) at the time — and the Denver Principles represent a \"careful synthesis\" of these two positions:\n\nThe activists — in an echo of the Lavender Menace radical feminists storming the NOW convention stage in 1970 — decided to storm the stage of the closing session of the Second National AIDS Forum in order to present the Denver Principles. As each of the 11 men read out one of the 11 statements, they did so with the \"Fighting for our lives\" banner behind them, from the San Francisco march earlier that month; these words became the slogan of the PWA Movement.\n\nAfter the conference, Campbell flew to New York with Callen, Berkowitz and Artie Felson, organizing and planning for local and national PWA organizations on the plane. On arrival, they organized a PWA organization in the city despite initial opposition from the Gay Men's Health Crisis. They also planned a national PWA organization which opened in New York City in June 1984. PWA-New York went on to create the first safer sex poster to appear in a gay bathhouse in the city.\n\nIn June 1984, the annual San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade was dedicated for the first time to people with AIDS. Dykes on Bikes have led the parade since the mid-1970s and People With AIDS followed immediately behind.\n\nInitially, there was very little coverage of the AIDS crisis outside the gay community — while 1982 saw 800 reported cases and 350 AIDS-related deaths in the USA, there were only 6 stories about AIDS on major network news and print media up to May 1983 included little coverage beyond the gay press and the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" — Lawrence Altman, medical writer at \"The New York Times\" had a piece refused in 1981, and Jerry Bishop, a science writer at \"The Wall Street Journal\", had a piece on AIDS refused by his editor in early 1982, whereas the \"Chronicle\" hired Randy Shilts to report on AIDS full-time in 1982. Campbell and Conant featured in the earliest nationally-broadcast news reports on the \"gay cancer\" on June 12, 1982, where Barry Petersen interviewed Campbell, Larry Kramer and James Curran, who led the CDC taskforce, for CBS News.\n\nAfter being criticised for omitting any coverage of a Madison Square Garden benefit in April 1983, \"The New York Times\" increased its coverage of AIDS, setting the tone for an increase across print media. One of the most high-profile early pieces introducing AIDS to the heterosexual community was the cover article of the August 8, 1983, edition of \"Newsweek\", showing Campbell and his lover Bobby Hilliard and headlined \"EPIDEMIC: The Mysterious and Deadly Disease Called AIDS May Be the Public Health Threat of the Century. How Did it Start? Can it Be Stopped?\" — only the second time an openly gay man had appeared on the cover of a mass-market news magazine, albeit with Hilliard identified as Campbell's \"friend.\" The following week, with Callen, Berkowitz, Felson and Turner, he met with Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Reagan administration. They found Heckler to be receptive to suggestions and, when Campbell pushed the issue of delays in people with AIDS's claims for Social Security, she promised to raise it with her counterpart at the Social Security Administration.\n\nAt the first Clinical Nursing Conference on AIDS, in Washington, D.C., on October 7, 1983, Campbell presented a poster session, \"dressed for the part\" in white pants and a lab coat. The poster session was designed to help clinicians and nurses understand the message of the Denver Principles, about respect for people with AIDS, rather than considering them as \"victims.\" While at the conference, he attended a talk by an infection control nurse at the National Institutes of Health where he discovered the agency's \"maximum awareness\" policy recommended the use of electric green \"AIDS Precaution\" tags on AIDS patients' rooms, blood tubes and laundry. With Artie Felson, he shouted his disgust at the \"creepy\" policy from the back of the room and arranged an impromptu meeting of the National Association of People With AIDS, where they decided to pay visit to Heckler at her Bethesda office. They spoke with Shelley Lengel, a spokesperson for the new National AIDS Helpline, however Lengel did not call them back with further information about the policy.\n\nIn January 1984, when Dan White, the assassin of gay San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, was due to be paroled, Campbell and Hilliard stood outside Soledad State Prison. As White had been transported to Los Angeles for fear of retributive attacks, attendant media had little to cover beyond Campbell with a sign reading \"Dan White's homophobia is more deadly than AIDS,\" bringing further national attention to the health crisis.\n\nLater that year, Campbell traveled with Angie Lewis to New Orleans for the annual convention of the American Nursing Association in June, where they gave a 45-minute or hour-long presentation — possibly a plenary session — about AIDS and HIV, having been invited at the last minute; Lewis suggested this may have been because the ANA were unsure about hosting the session.\n\nCampbell gave one of his last speeches at the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights when the 1984 Democratic National Convention was held in San Francisco in July. He was introduced as a feminist, a registered Democrat and a Person With AIDS; he had served as a board director of the National AIDS Foundation and on the steering committee of the Federation of AIDS-related Organizations, founded the National Association of People With AIDS and testified in front of Congressional subcommittees. Campbell told the crowd that he had hugged his boyfriend on the cover of \"Newsweek\", and then kissed Hilliard on stage, \"to show Middle America that gay love is beautiful,\" criticising the Christian right for using scripture to justify their homophobia. After criticising the lack of progress being made by the Reagan administration, he held 15 seconds of silence for the 2,000 who had died of AIDS at that point \"and [for] those who will die before this is over,\" before laying out a series of concerns for politicians to address — including increased funding for both research and support services and a warning of the potential for discrimination with the advent of a test for HTLV-3 (now known as HIV) — and appealing to all candidates in the upcoming elections to meet with people with AIDS.\n\nTwo weeks later, Campbell appeared on \"CBS Evening News\" in a live satellite interview with Dan Rather. While the rumors and fear of AIDS had reached a mainstream audience, the facts had not yet, so Campbell was placed in a glass booth, with technicians refusing to come near him to wire up microphones for the interview.\n\nA few days after the DNC speech, another case of shingles left scars across his head; within weeks he was hospitalized with cryptosporidiosis and subsequently cryptococcal meningitis. At noon on August 15, 1984, exactly a month after his DNC speech and after 2 days on life support in intensive care, Campbell died at San Francisco General Hospital when his blood pressure dropped rapidly. His parents and his partner Bobby Hilliard were by his side. Campbell was 32 years old and had lived for over 3½ years with what was, by then, called AIDS.\n\nTwo days later, the city closed Castro Street for Campbell's funeral cortège, where 1,000 people gathered to remember Campbell. A \"reverential chant\" by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence was followed by several speeches, including Conant and Hilliard as well as Campbell's parents and local performers (including Lea DeLaria and Holly Near) and an audio recording of Paul Boneberg introducing Campbell at the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights a month earlier. In his August 23 obituary in the \"Bay Area Reporter\", Allen White described the event as \"exactly what should be expected to remember a hero in a crisis.\" \"The Gay Life\" radio show on KSAN-FM, presented by Randy Alfred, Campbell's editor at the \"Sentinel\", covered his memorial across two weeks, on September 16 and 23, 1984.<ref name=\"The Gay Life 1984-09-16/23\"></ref> His body was taken back to Washington state and interred at New Tacoma Cemetery in Tacoma. Campbell had kept a journal throughout his life; Angie Lewis arranged for the journal to be donated to the UCSF Archives and Special Collections.\n\nThe 1985 Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day Parade was dedicated to Campbell, \"for the work he did as a Person With AIDS, and as a symbol for all of us who continue to fight against the threat that AIDS poses to our survival.\" In 2015, the group \"Let's Kick ASS—AIDS Survivor Syndrome\" were looking to have a commemorative plaque erected at the site of the Star Pharmacy (now a Walgreens), where Campbell first put up images of his KS lesions. Bobbi Campbell is memorialized on 4 separate panels of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt.\n\nIn the 1993 docudrama TV movie \"And the Band Played On\", adapted from Randy Shilts's book of the same name about the early days of the AIDS crisis, Campbell was played by Donal Logue. Campbell was also portrayed by Kevin McHale in the 2017 docudrama miniseries \"When We Rise\" written by Dustin Lance Black to chronicle the gay rights movement. The name \"Bobbi Campbell\" and the names of several other key figures of the time were featured in the American Mock Trial Association's 2007–08 National Case Problem, albeit in a fictional case, unrelated to Campbell's life.\n\n"}

Before founding the movement she was a shopkeeper, brewer of banana beer, and a prostitute. Mwerinde was also a member of a religious group that was devoted to the Virgin Mary. She and two other group members approached Joseph Kibweteere in 1989, and said that the Virgin Mary had instructed him to take them in. Kibweteere did, and he was particularly struck by her claim of a Marian apparition near his home, which related to a vision he himself had five years earlier. Together Mwerinde and Kibweteere would found the Movement in 1989.\n\nMwerinde was part of the trio that lead the sect, which included Kibweteere, and Dominic Kataribaabo, an excommunicated priest. However Paul Ikazire, a sect leader who later returned to the Catholic Church, described her as being the true power in the Movement. He said, \"The meetings were chaired by Sister Credonia, who was the de facto head of the group. Kibwetere was just a figurehead, intended to impose masculine authority over the followers and enhance the cult's public relations.\" Mwerinde was also the source of the sect's predictions of an apocalypse and the pronouncements that salvation could only be found with the Virgin Mary's messages.\n\nThe Movement grew rapidly and at its height membership was estimated as being between 1,000 and 4,000. Defrocked Catholic priests and nuns joined and worked as theologians. The apocalypse was predicted to occur with the advent of the new millennium. After the Movement was evicted from Rwashamaire, it moved to an estate her father owned in the Kanungu District. With the year 2000 approaching sect members sold their property and turned the profits over to group leadership.\n\nWhen the world did not end by January 1, a crisis occurred in the Movement. Members began to ask questions and demand the return of their money and property. Police investigators believe that Movement leadership, particularly Mwerinde, began a purge of their followers culminating in the destruction of their Kanangu Church in a fire that killed all 530 inside. Hundreds of bodies were also found at Movement properties across southwestern Uganda. Initially believed to be a mass suicide, police later stated that they were investigating it as a mass murder.\n\nMwerinde is assumed to have survived the church conflagration. Ugandan authorities believe that she left the sect's Kanangu compound in the early hours of March 17. In April 2000, police issued an international warrant for her arrest in connection to the sect killings.\n\nIn September 2011, Mwerinde and several other prognosticators who incorrectly predicted various dates for the end of world were jointly awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for \"teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions and calculations\".\n\n"}

He comes from a Buryat background. He is married with six children.\n\nAn economist, Byambasüren served as the chief of the State Statistical Office and the Institute of Management, although his influence initially waned after the fall of his mentor Jambyn Batmönkh. By 1989 he had risen to the position of deputy head of the Council of Ministers and after the 1990 elections (which were largely democratic) he was chosen as the final Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic. His ministry was noted as reforming but also as something of a technocracy, featuring a number of former communists who had altered their positions to suit the new mood of the country. However he also developed a reputation for diplomacy, visiting Germany, Belgium and France, as well as Moscow and a first visit by a Mongolian leader to China for over thirty years, during the course of his Premiership. He was succeeded in 1992 by Puntsagiin Jasrai. Byambasüren sought to improve Mongolia's external relations and worked particularly closely with Japan, which, along with the World Bank, pledged $320 million to Mongolia under his premiership.\n\nHe left the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in October 1992, criticizing its continuing hegemony in the country and its close links to communist parties elsewhere. He went on to form his own pro-democracy group, the Mongolian Democratic Renaissance Party (\"Mongolyn Ardqilsan Särgään Mandalyn Nam\"), in 1994.\n\nLater Byambasüren was at the forefront of campaigns to stop archaeologists from digging for the remains of Genghis Khan.

He is known for his 1967 book \"The Naked Ape\", and for his television programmes such as \"Zoo Time\".\n\nMorris was born in Purton, Wiltshire, to Marjorie (née Hunt) and children's fiction author Harry Morris. In 1933, the Morrises moved to Swindon where Desmond developed an interest in natural history and writing. He was educated at Dauntsey's School, a boarding school in Wiltshire. \n\nIn 1946, he joined the British Army for two years of national service, becoming a lecturer in fine arts at the Chiseldon Army College. After being demobilised in 1948, he held his first one-man show of his own paintings at the Swindon Arts Centre, and studied zoology at the University of Birmingham. In 1950 he held a surrealist art exhibition with Joan Miró at the London Gallery. He held many other exhibitions in later years. Also in 1950, Desmond Morris wrote and directed two surrealist films, \"Time Flower\" and \"The Butterfly and the Pin\". In 1951 he began a doctorate at the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford in animal behaviour. In 1954, he earned a Doctor of Philosophy for his work on the reproductive behaviour of the ten-spined stickleback.\n\nMorris stayed at Oxford, researching the reproductive behaviour of birds. In 1956 he moved to London as Head of the Granada TV and Film Unit for the Zoological Society of London, and studied the picture-making abilities of apes. The work included creating programmes for film and television on animal behaviour and other zoology topics. He hosted Granada TV's weekly \"Zoo Time\" programme until 1959, scripting and hosting 500 programmes, and 100 episodes of the show \"Life in the Animal World\" for BBC2. In 1957 he organised an exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, showing paintings and drawings composed by chimpanzees. In 1958 he co-organised an exhibition, \"The Lost Image\", which compared pictures by infants, human adults, and apes, at the Royal Festival Hall in London. In 1959 he left \"Zoo Time\" to become the Zoological Society's Curator of Mammals. In 1964 he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on \"Animal Behaviour\". In 1967 he spent a year as executive director of the London Institute of Contemporary Arts.\n\nMorris's books include \"The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal\", published in 1967. The book sold well enough for Morris to move to Malta in 1968 to write a sequel and other books. In 1973 he returned to Oxford to work for the ethologist Niko Tinbergen. From 1973 to 1981, Morris was a Research Fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford. In 1979 he undertook a television series for Thames TV, \"The Human Race\", followed in 1982 by \"Man Watching in Japan\", \"The Animals Road Show\" in 1986 and then several other series. National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C1672/16) with Desmond Morris in 2015 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.\n\nWhen Morris was 14, his father was killed whilst serving in the armed forces, causing Morris to drift towards surrealism. His grandfather William Morris, an enthusiastic Victorian naturalist and founder of the Swindon local newspaper, greatly influenced him during his time living in Swindon.\nIn July 1952, Morris married Ramona Baulch; they had one son, Jason. In 1978, Morris was elected Vice-Chairman of Oxford United F.C..\n\nMorris lives in the same house in North Oxford as the 19th-century lexicographer James Murray who worked on the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".

He was a homeless man who used to hunt passersby at a park in the city of San Cristobal, Táchira State. Once he was caught, he confessed to killing and eating at least 10 men over a period of two years preceding his arrest in 1999.\n\nDorángel Vargas was born in 1956 to poor farmers. His priors include three arrests, two of them for minor offenses (theft of chickens and cattle). The third was acquired in 1995 when he was admitted to the Institute of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Peribeca for the murder of Baltazar Cruz Moreno, and the subsequent cannibalism of his body. He managed to escape from that center, and lead a seemingly normal life in poverty, without bothering anyone again.\n\nIt is believed that he was actively murdering between November 1998 and January 1999. Dorángel hunted victims with a tube-shaped spear and occasionally with rocks. He kept the parts that he could cook and usually buried the feet, hands and heads. It seemed that his primary targets were unsuspecting athletes and laborers working on the riverbank. He did not eat women or children. Since he had no place to store the human flesh, most of it would decompose quickly, which made him kill routinely.\n\nOn February 12, 1999, members of the Civil Defense found the remains of two young people and alerted the security forces. Searching around the same area, the remains of six more bodies were found. Hypotheses about the findings included the plot being a cemetery for corpses linked to drug gangs and even a burial ground for victims of Satanic cult rituals. The victims, after further investigation, were all found to have been missing persons. As the investigation progressed, Vargas became a suspect, An inspection of the Shack he was living on near the area, revealed several vessels containing human flesh and viscera prepared for consumption, along with three human heads and several feet and hands.\n\nOnce captured, he confessed to having killed and eaten at least 10 men over a period of two years since his arrest in 1999.\n"}

{"id": "9839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9839", "title": "Ezra", "text": "Ezra\n\nEzra (; , '; fl. 480–440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe (, ') and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe (\"sofer\") and priest (\"kohen\"). In Greco-Latin Ezra is called Esdras (). According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Sraya () the last High Priest to serve in the First Temple (), and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the Second Temple ( CJB and similar translations only; see also ). He returned from Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem ( and ). According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy, he was also a High Priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was an ordinary member of the priesthood.\n\nSeveral traditions have developed over his place of burial. One tradition says that he is buried in al-Uzayr near Basra (Iraq), while another tradition alleges that he is buried in Tadif near Aleppo, in northern Syria.\n\nHis name may be an abbreviation of ', \"Yah helps\". In the Greek Septuagint the name is rendered ' (), from which the Latin name comes.\n\nThe Book of Ezra describes how he led a group of Judean exiles living in Babylon to their home city of Jerusalem () where he is said to have enforced observance of the Torah. He was described as exhorting the Israelite people to be sure to follow the Torah Law so as not to intermarry with people of particular different religions, a set of commandments described in the Pentateuch.\n\nEzra, known as \"Ezra the scribe\" in Chazalic literature, is a highly respected figure in Judaism.\n\nThe canonical Book of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah are the oldest sources for the activity of Ezra, whereas many of the other books ascribed to Ezra (First Esdras, 3–6 Ezra) are later literary works dependent on the canonical books of Ezra and Nehemiah.\n\nThe books of Ezra–Nehemiah were originally one scroll. Later the Jews divided this scroll and called it First and Second Ezra. Modern Hebrew Bibles call the two books Ezra and Nehemiah, as do other modern Bible translations. A few parts of the Book of Ezra (4:8 to 6:18 and 7:12–26) were written in Aramaic, and the majority in Hebrew, Ezra himself being skilled in both languages. Ezra was living in Babylon when in the seventh year ( BCE) of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, the king sent him to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God to any who did not know them. Ezra led a large body of exiles back to Jerusalem, where he discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He tore his garments in despair and confessed the sins of Israel before God, then braved the opposition of some of his own countrymen to purify the community by enforcing the dissolution of the sinful marriages. Some years later Artaxerxes sent Nehemiah (a Jewish noble in his personal service) to Jerusalem as governor with the task of rebuilding the city walls. Once this task was completed Nehemiah had Ezra read the Law of Moses (the Torah) to the assembled Israelites, and the people and priests entered into a covenant to keep the law and separate themselves from all other peoples.\n\n1 Esdras, probably from the late 2nd/early 1st centuries BCE, preserves a Greek text of Ezra and a part of Nehemiah distinctly different from that of Ezra–Nehemiah – in particular it eliminates Nehemiah from the story and gives some of his deeds to Ezra, as well as telling events in a different order. Scholars are divided on whether it is based on Ezra–Nehemiah, or reflects an earlier literary stage before the combination of Ezra and Nehemiah accounts.\n\nThe first-century Jewish historian Josephus deals with Ezra in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\". He preferred 1 Esdras over the canonical Ezra–Nehemiah and placed Ezra as a contemporary of Xerxes, son of Darius – rather than of Artaxerxes.\n\nThe apocalyptic fourth book of Ezra (also called the second book of Esdras) was written c. CE 100, probably in Hebrew-Aramaic. It was one of the most important sources for Jewish theology at the end of the 1st century. In this book, Ezra has a seven part prophetic revelation, converses with an angel of God three times and has four visions. Ezra, thirty years into the Babylonian Exile (4 Ezra 3:1 / 2 Esdras 1:1), recounts the siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomon's Temple. This would place these revelations in the year 557 BCE, a full century before the date given in the canonical Ezra. The central theological themes are \"the question of theodicy, God's justness in the face of the triumph of the heathens over the pious, the course of world history in terms of the teaching of the four kingdoms, the function of the law, the eschatological judgment, the appearance on Earth of the heavenly Jerusalem, the Messianic Period, at the end of which the Messiah will die, the end of this world and the coming of the next, and the Last Judgment.\" Ezra restores the law that was destroyed with the burning of the Temple in Jerusalem. He dictates 24 books for the public (i.e. the Hebrew Bible) and another 70 for the wise alone (70 unnamed revelatory works). At the end, he is taken up to heaven like Enoch and Elijah. Ezra is seen as a new Moses in this book.\n\nThere is also another work, thought to be influenced by this one, known as the \"Greek Apocalypse of Ezra\".\n\nTraditionally Judaism credits Ezra with establishing the Great Assembly of scholars and prophets, the forerunner of the Sanhedrin, as the authority on matters of religious law. The Great Assembly is credited with establishing numerous features of contemporary traditional Judaism in something like their present form, including Torah reading, the Amidah, and celebration of the feast of Purim.\n\nIn Rabbinic traditions, Ezra is metaphorically referred to as the \"flowers that appear on the earth\" signifying the springtime in the national history of Judaism. A disciple of Baruch ben Neriah, he favored study of the Law over the reconstruction of the Temple and thus because of his studies, he did not join the first party returning to Jerusalem in the reign of Cyrus. According to another opinion, he did not join the first party so as not to compete, even involuntarily, with Jeshua ben Jozadak for the office of chief priest.\n\nAccording to Jewish tradition, Ezra was the writer of the Books of Chronicles, and is the same prophet known also as Malachi. There is a slight controversy within rabbinic sources as to whether or not Ezra had served as Kohen Gadol.\n\nAccording to the Babylonian Talmud, Ezra the scribe is said to have enacted ten standing laws and orders, which are as follows: 1) That the public come together to read from the scroll of the Law on Sabbath days during the time of the afternoon oblation (Minchah), because of those travelling merchants who loiter in the closed shops in the street corners, and who may have missed the biblical lections that were read during the weekdays; 2) that the courts be opened throughout the Jewish townships on Mondays and Thursdays; 3) that women do not wait beyond Thursday to launder their clothes, because of the honor due to the Sabbath day; 4) that men would accustom themselves to eat [cooked] garlic on the eve of the Sabbath (believed to enhance love between a man and his wife); 5) that women would rise up early on Friday mornings to bake bread, so that a piece of bread will be available for the poor; 6) that Jewish women in every place be girded with a wide belt (waist band), whether from the front or from behind, out of modesty; 7) that Jewish women, during their menses, wash and comb their hair three days prior to their purification in a ritual bath; 8) that the travelling merchants make regular rounds into the Jewish townships because of the honor due to the daughters of Israel; 9) that Jewish women and/or girls, as a precautionary measure, be accustomed to conversing with one another while one of their party goes out to relieve herself in the outhouse; 10) that men who may have suffered a seminal emission (especially after accompanying with their wives) be required to immerse themselves in a ritual bath before being permitted to read from the scroll of the Law.\n\nIn the Syrian village of Tedef, a synagogue said to be the place where Ezra stopped over has been venerated by Jews for centuries. Another tradition locates his tomb near Basra, Iraq.\n\nEarly Christian writers occasionally cited Ezra as author of the apocalyptic books attributed to him. Clement of Alexandria in his \"Stromata\" referred to Ezra as an example of prophetic inspiration, quoting a section from 2 Esdras.\n\nIn Islam he is known as Uzair (). He was mentioned in the Qur'an. Although he was not mentioned as one of the Prophets of Islam, he is considered as one of them by some Muslim scholars, based on Islamic traditions. His tomb at Al-ʻUzair on the banks of the Tigris near Basra, Iraq, is a pilgrimage site for the local Marsh Arabs. Many Islamic scholars and modern Western academics do not view Uzair as \"Ezra\"; for example Professor Gordon Darnell Newby associates Uzair with Enoch and Metatron. On this Timothy Winter (Abdal Hakim Murad) and Gordon Darnell Newby associate Uzair again with Enoch (ancestor of Noah) and by extension Metatron the creator-angel or \"lesser Yahweh\".\n\nScholars are divided over the chronological sequence of the activities of Ezra and Nehemiah. Ezra came to Jerusalem \"in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the King\". The text does not specify whether the king in the passage refers to Artaxerxes I (465–424 BCE) or to Artaxerxes II (404–359 BCE). Most scholars hold that Ezra lived during the rule of Artaxerxes I, though some have difficulties with this assumption: Nehemiah and Ezra \"seem to have no knowledge of each other; their missions do not overlap\", however, in Nehemiah 12, both are leading processions on the wall as part of the wall dedication ceremony. So, they clearly were contemporaries working together in Jerusalem at the time the wall and the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt in contrast to the previously stated viewpoint.;.\" These difficulties have led many scholars to assume that Ezra arrived in the seventh year of the rule of Artaxerxes II, i.e. some 50 years after Nehemiah. This assumption would imply that the biblical account is not chronological. The last group of scholars regard \"the seventh year\" as a scribal error and hold that the two men were contemporaries.\n\nMary Joan Winn Leith in \"The Oxford History of the Biblical World\" believes that Ezra was a historical figure whose life was enhanced in the scripture and given a theological buildup. Gosta W. Ahlstrom argues the inconsistencies of the biblical tradition are insufficient to say that Ezra, with his central position as the 'father of Judaism' in the Jewish tradition, has been a later literary invention. Those who argue against the historicity of Ezra argue that the presentation style of Ezra as a leader and lawgiver resembles that of Moses. There are also similarities between Ezra the priest-scribe (but not high priest) and Nehemiah the secular governor on the one hand and Joshua and Zerubbabel on the other hand. The early 2nd-century BCE Jewish author Ben Sira praises Nehemiah, but makes no mention of Ezra.\n\nRichard Friedman argued in his book \"Who Wrote the Bible?\" (p. 232 1997 edition) that Ezra is the one who redacted the Torah, and in fact effectively produced the first Torah. It has been argued that even if one does not accept the documentary hypothesis, Ezra was instrumental in the start of the process of bringing the Torah together.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the commander of arguably the largest and perhaps the best-known group of freedom fighters, at the Uprising's strongest and most lengthy point of resistance, Budapest's Corvin Passage (\"Corvin Köz\"); between the 1 and 9 November 1956. Under his command, the Corvin Passage fighters destroyed at least a dozen Soviet tanks, and resisted several waves of assault. Following the conflict, Pongrátz escaped capture and by 1957 had moved to the United States where he spent the majority of his exile until returning to Hungary in 1991. During his exile he was elected both Vice-Chairman and then Chairman of the Hungarian Freedom Fighters' Association (\"Magyar Szabadságharcos Szövetség\").\n\nArmed civilians in the Corvin Cinema (the three floor circular structure on the right of the picture) and surrounding buildings began to fight with the Soviet armoured forces as early as the night of 23–4 October. Taking advantage of the area’s excellent strategic conditions, the rebels of the Corvin Passage (\"Corvin Köz\") soon became the Uprising's biggest and most important armed revolutionary group. Their valour was a decisive factor behind the favourable turn of events on 28 October.\n\nThe Corvin fighters were initially led by László Iván Kovács, with the young and charismatic Pongrátz taking command on 1 November. (24 at the time of the conflict he was nicknamed \"Bajusz,\" meaning \"moustache.\") Representatives of the Corvin Passage group negotiated several times with national political and military leaders during the ceasefire, and their influence on armed groups in their neighbourhood steadily increased.\n\nThe Red Army began to attack the group in considerable strength on the evening of November 4. However, the defenders managed to hold their positions until the following afternoon, when the Soviets followed up an artillery bombardment with a further strong attack. The surrounding buildings were seriously damaged and the cinema itself caught fire.\n\nThough they had destroyed at least a dozen Soviet Tanks, with little more than Molotov cocktails, the overwhelming force of the assault caused the group to abandon its base. Nevertheless, members of Pongrátz's Corvin Passage fighters continued their resistance as guerrillas in other parts of the city for several days. While others retreated into the cellars of the buildings until they were crushed by their enemy's superior numbers; the Communist forces having poured 31,550 troops and 1,130 tanks into Budapest.\n\nFollowing his return from exile in 1991, and in addition to his becoming president of the World Federation of Hungarians (\"Magyarok Világszövetsége\"), Pongrátz was a frequent and vocal critic of the successive Hungarian Socialist governments that came to power after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Despite the events of 1989\nPongrátz witnessed the democratic successor organization to the Communist party of his youth continuing to be the dominant political force in Hungary.\n\nDepressed by what he saw as the continued presence and pervasive influence of former Hungarian Communists in the senior posts of government, commerce and public life; he became a leading figure in a new Hungarian nationalist movement, eventually founding a right-wing political party, the Movement for a Better Hungary (\"Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom\"), today third largest party in Hungary.\n\nPongrátz first founded a museum of the 1956 revolution in 1991. It was closed in 1995 after the local authorities wished to use the building for a different purpose. Pongrátz then purchased and renovated an old school building in Kiskunmajsa and turned it into the only museum of the 1956 Revolution that exists in Hungary.\n\nGergely Pongrátz died in the grounds of his museum, after suffering a heart attack. Several high-ranking state officials, including the President of the Republic of Hungary, were present at his funeral. He died a year short of the 50th anniversary of those few weeks in 1956 that had dominated the whole of his life.\n\nHe was married and had three children - one daughter and two sons.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the biggest heroes of the Uprising.\n\nHe was born in Lenovac, near Zaječar, in the Crna Reka nahija, into the family of Petar (hence he took \"Petrović\" as his surname) and Petrinja. He had two younger brothers, Milutin and Miljko. His father was called \"Sirenjar Petar\" (\"Peter the Cheese Maker\") due to his multitude of livestock which he possessed, and the amount of cheese he sold. His father was a very calm person, though Veljko was an unruly kid. In his youth he kept cattle, even becoming \"čobanbaša\" (\"head herder\") among the local herders. The local Turks often visited their house, eating their food, drinking and taking cheese, butter oil, and milk.\n\nOsman Pazvantoğlu's \"krdžalije\" (Ottoman brigands), who were deemed rebels by the Sultan, had fought the Imperial troops at Crna Reka, and then continued to attack local Turks loyal to the Sultan, and burned and devastated several villages in the region, including Lenovac. This prompted Veljko, only 15 years old, to leave his parents and brothers for Vidin. There he was hired as a shepherd by a Turk, and after some time he left for Požarevac, where he was hired by the Vojvoda of Požarevac to prepare food. As he had also spent some time there, at Easter time, he danced the \"kolo\" with his friends, forgetting to prepare the important dinner for his master. For this, his master chased to beat him, thus Veljko fled, ending up in the \"hajduk\" (Serbian brigands) bands of Stanoje Glavaš. In the winter time of 1803, Glavaš had arranged for Veljko to stay at the house of a \"jatak\" (\"concealer\", civil hajduk supporter) in Dubona, in the Smederevo nahija, where he would work as a shepherd. In the same village Veljko met Marija, a widow and relative of Glavaš, and married her, moving to her house. Not long after the wedding, the Slaughter of the Knezes took place (January 1804), in which prominent Serb leaders were executed by the Janissary military junta of the Sanjak of Smederevo (these janissaries, under the leadership of Kučuk Alija, had murdered \"sanjak-bey\" Hadži Mustafa Pasha on 15 December 1801 and taken the rule of the sanjak). As a response to the executions, the Serbian population, without a central figure, took measures of self-defence, and spontaneously attacked the jannisaries.\n\nHearing of Karađorđe's activities, Veljko immediately asked his wife for hajduk wear and weapons, and joined Glavaš' bands. When Karađorđe arrived at Orašac on the Meeting of the Lord, February 2, 1804, and was chosen by the people, Glavaš, Katić, Čarapić, Jakovljević, Vule, and others, to be the \"Supreme Leader of the Serb People\", Veljko was present in Glavaš' \"četa\" (band of fighters). As the Uprising developed, Glavaš lay away his weapon, and Veljko then served the Smederevo Vojvoda Dušan Vulićević (known as \"Đuša\") fighting the Ottomans. In the fall of 1805, Vojvoda Đuša was killed by the Turks in Smederevo. Karađorđe put Đuša's younger brother Vujica Vulićević in his place. Veljko became one of Vujica's \"buljukbašica\" (a commander of a few men).\n\nWith Dušan Vulićević he fought to free Beograd (1806), where he excelled in combat. In 1807 he became a \"buljubaša / буљубаша\" and is granted permission from the Council to incite rebellion in the areas of Krivi Vir and Crna Reka. In 1809, he, despite being heavily outnumbered, bravely defended Soko Banja from the Turks. His personal bravery was extraordinary and won him extraordinary praise and fame throughout Serbia and the Balkans. In 1810 he was decorated with Russian Golden Cross for his bravery.\nHe was noted in the battle of Varvarin, where he was wounded in his left arm and became slightly crippled. In 1811 he became \"Voivoda of the Timocka Krajina\" and he was sent to Negotin, in Timocka Krajina In 1813, a detachment of Turkish cavalry attacked him at village of Bukovče where Veljko destroyed them. Turks then set forth with much stronger force, so Veljko retreated to Negotin to defend it.\n\nLarge battles took place around Negotin in the summer of 1813. The Turks began to lay siege to Negotin with reinforcements from Vlaška (Walachia). In total, 16,000 Turkish soldiers attacked Negotin, which was defended by 3,000 Serbian soldiers. Veljko fortified Negotin, built a moat and towers, and waited for the Turks. The tallest tower in which Veljko resided, was named Baba Finka. In the moats, together with Veljko were his brothers Milutin and Miljko. Also, there were the prominent buljubaše and Dimbaše Hadži-Nikola, Abrašelibalta among many others. The expected aid that Veljko had requested didn't arrive, and ammunition was running low, so Veljko ordered all tin objects in the city melted down for ammunition, and he ordered metal coins to be put into the cannons. One morning after twenty days of heroic defense, he ordered repair around his moat was struck by a cannonball. He died almost immediately. The Battle of Negotin ended in massive Turkish casualties and the successful escape of the Serbian rebels. His brother Milutin buried him at sunset at Negotin's church. After Veljko's death Turks conquered Negotin and soon all Krajin . He is still remembered for his famous words: \"Glavu dajem, Krajinu ne dajem\". (I'll give my head, but not Krajina)\n\nJust before the Battle of Negotin, his friend, Vuk Karadžić suggested to him that he send his gold, jewels and other valuables to his family, so they wouldn't fall into Turkish hands. But Veljko refused, believing it wouldn't be proper for a great hajduk and war hero to be slain and found penniless. Veljko considered his personal reputation and glory more important than mere gold.\n\nAs a popular hero, there existed songs about him even during his lifetime. There exist over 70 lyrical and 10 epic poems about him. Some of the most known songs or epic poems include \"Raslo mi je badem drvo\" (\"Расло ми је бадем дрво\") and \"Bolan mi leži Kara-Mustafa\" (\"Болан ми лежи Кара-Мустафа\").\n\nSerbian comic author Živorad Atanacković (1933-1998) created an adventurous comic on the person of Veljko Petrović, with the theme of the First Serbian Uprising (\"Hajduk Veljko\", 1966).\n\nSome Bulgarian historians have portrayed Veljko as a Bulgarian, as part of their national aspirations. According to Georges Castellan his mother was ethnic Bulgarian.\n\nHe is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.\n"}
{"id": "1956128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956128", "title": "Henry Newton Brown", "text": "Henry Newton Brown\n\nHenry Newton Brown (1857 – April 30, 1884) was an American Old West gunman who played the roles of both lawman and outlaw during his life.\n\nBrown was raised in Cold Springs Township, in Phelps County, ten miles south of Rolla, Missouri. An orphan, he lived there with his uncle Jasper and aunt Aldamira Richardson until the age of seventeen, when he left home and headed west. He drifted through various cowboy jobs in Colorado and Texas, supposedly killing a man in a gunfight in the Texas Panhandle.\n\nIn 1877, Brown landed in the New Mexico Territory, and became embroiled in the Lincoln County War, a battle of wills for economic domination of the region between two opposing factions. The first was the association of Attorney Alexander McSween and John Henry Tunstall, sometimes noted as \"the good guys.\" They had the support of cattle baron John Chisum and a company of young working cowboys that were to become proficient gunmen known as \"The Regulators.\" Brown joined Billy the Kid and others of this group as a cowboy working on Tunstall's Rio Feliz Ranch.\n\nThe opposing faction, sometimes noted as the \"bad guys,\" were known as \"The House\" was the partnership of Major Lawrence G. Murphy and James J. Dolan, bolstered by a powerful political machine known as the \"Santa Fe Ring.\" Lincoln County Sheriff William Brady and his deputies, as well as a cadre of gunmen, were loyal to \"The House.\"\n\nOn April 1, 1878, Brown, Billy the Kid, Jim French, Frank McNab, John Middleton and Fred Waite ambushed and murdered Lincoln County Sheriff William Brady, who was indirectly responsible for the death of the Regulators' employer, John Tunstall. Three days later, at the famous Gunfight at Blazer's Mill, Brown and the Regulators engaged in a gunfight with Buckshot Roberts, another man they believed involved in Tunstall's murder. Roberts received a serious gunshot wound from Charlie Bowdre which later proved to be fatal, but not before he managed to kill the Regulators' nominal leader, Richard M. Brewer. Retreating into proprietor Blazer's office, Roberts continued a prolonged firefight with Brown and the Regulators. He died the next day.\n\nThe Lincoln County Regulators — fugitives now for the Brady killing — spent the next several months in hiding. Then on July 15, 1878, they became trapped, along with one of Tunstall's partners, Alexander McSween, in McSween's home in Lincoln by members of \"The House\" and some of Brady's men. Henry Brown was one of three Regulators not actually in McSween's house at the time, but instead was sniping at Brady's men from a grain warehouse behind the Tunstall store. He escaped with Billy the Kid and the others when the siegers set fire to the house. McSween was shot down while fleeing the blaze, and his death essentially marked the end of the Lincoln County Cattle War.\n\nIn the fall of that year, Brown, Billy the Kid, and a few of the remaining Regulators trailed a herd of rustled horses to the little town of Tascosa in the Texas Panhandle. After the horses were sold the Regulators returned to their old haunts, but Brown, named in two murder warrants in the state of New Mexico, wisely remained in Texas where he eventually became a lawman. It has not been established whether he was a deputy sheriff of Oldham County, Texas; Marshal of Tascosa or a constable. He had a quick temper and was quickly dismissed because he \"was always wanting to fight and get his mane up.\"\n\nBrown thereafter drifted through the (Oklahoma) Indian Territory and into Kansas, working on ranches. In July, 1882, when about 25 years old, he settled in Caldwell, Kansas—a rough cattle town comparable to Dodge City and Abilene—where he was first appointed Assistant Marshal of the city; then promoted to marshal about five months later. The Chisholm Trail met the Santa Fe tracks in Caldwell and as the terminus of the trail, it had a long history of violence. Brown, an outlaw turned lawman, and Ben Wheeler, who had been a former Texas lawman turned outlaw, joined forces (with Wheeler as Assistant Marshal) and effectively cleaned up the town.\n\nBrown was described by contemporaries as a \"very much undersize\" man who didn't smoke, drink, chew, or gamble, and was noted to be in regular attendance at the Methodist Church. Said to be \"exceedingly modest and, in fact, bashful,\" he displayed an introvert presence but \"gained the entire confidence of the people . . . and . . . conducted himself in such a manner that the doors of society were always open to him.\"\n\nBut, \"he had a square set jaw, not unlike that of a bull dog\" and \"his face indicated firmness and a lack of physical fear.\" \"His words were few and parted with reluctantly,\" and when duty called, Brown's demeanor changed immediately. He was easily angered: his temper flared instantly and his outwardly meek manner transformed into one of deadly grave purpose. One contemporary commented that \"he was a two-gun man. He could take a six-shooter in each hand and make one think a battle was on.\"\n\nFrom the grateful community, in appreciation for his service, he was given an extensively engraved, gold and silver mounted Winchester rifle. A silver medallion was affixed to the stock inscribed: \n\"Presented to City Marshal\nH. N. Brown\nFor valuable services rendered \nIn behalf of the Citizens of\nCaldwell Kas \nA. N. Colson Mayor Dec 1882\"\n\nBrown killed a gambler, Newt Boyce, with the rifle (in the line of duty) on December 16, 1883. Another killing attributed to Brown in Caldwell was that of Spotted Horse, a renegade Indian.\n\nHenry Brown gained status in the higher realms of Caldwell society when he married Alice Maude Levagood, the daughter of a well-to-do Caldwell brick maker. Alice had a college degree―rare for females of that era.\n\nMarshal Brown and his assistant kept the town clean, and by the time they were appointed to their third term, they were lauded by the citizens as the best and most effective team of lawmen the town had ever had.\n\nIn April, 1884, Brown and Wheeler concocted a story convincing the mayor to give them leave to travel into the Indian Territory to hunt a murderer. With two Cherokee Outlet cowboys, William Smith and John Wesley, they rode to Medicine Lodge, Kansas, and attempted to rob the Medicine Valley Bank. Almost immediately, their attempt fell apart in disaster when gunfire erupted and two of the bank officers were shot. Most conventional accounts name Brown as bank president Wylie Payne's murderer. But T. A. McNeal, author of \"When Kansas Was Young\", sat at his friend Payne's bedside as he lay dying and reports that Payne named Wesley as his killer. Wheeler (and possibly, Wesley) shot George Geppert, the bank's chief cashier who, just before he died, sealed the vault, preventing the robbers from escaping with any money.\n\nBrown and the outlaws fled under fire, pursued by a posse composed of 12 cowboys that happened to be in a stable directly across the street from the bank. The four fugitives, closely pursued by the posse, unwittingly rode into a box canyon several miles south of the town and were eventually forced to surrender. \n\nLater, incarcerated in the town's small jail, they anticipated a lynch mob, and were offered the opportunity to write letters to their loved ones. Brown did write a poignant letter to his wife. It read in part:\n\"Darling Wife: I am in jail here. Four of us tried to rob the bank here and one man shot one of the men in the bank. I want you to come and see me as soon as you can. I will send you all of my things and you can sell them. But keep the Winchester. It is hard for me to write this letter, but it was all for you, my sweet wife, and for the love I have for you. \"Do not go back on me. If you do it will kill me. Be true to me as long as you live, and come to see me if you think enough of me. My love is just the same as it always was. Oh, how I did hate to leave you last Sunday evening. But I did not think this would happen. I thought we could take in the money and not have any trouble with it, but a man's fondest hopes are sometimes broken with trouble. We would not have been arrested but one of our horses gave out and we could not leave him [the rider] alone. I do not know what to write. Do the best you can with everything. I want you to send me some clothes. Sell all the things you don't need. Have your picture taken and send it to me. Now, my dear wife, go and see Mr. Witzleben and Mr. Nyce and get the money. If a mob does not kill us we will come out all right after while. Maude, I did not shoot anyone and didn't want the others to kill anyone. But they did and that is all there is about it. Now, my darling wife, goodbye. H. N. Brown.\"\n\nRealizing that a lynching was imminent, Wesley removed his boot and with it, the shackle of the leg-iron with which he had been shackled to Brown. Brown tied the loose end of the leg-iron to his leg with his bandana allowing him to run unencumbered. Smith, handcuffed to Wheeler, was able to slip the handcuff over his small hand resulting, unknown to the gathering mob, in all four being free. When the lynch mob came at 9 pm and opened the door, Brown burst through the startled lynch mob to an alley alongside the jail. As he ran past, he was blasted with both barrels of a shotgun at almost point blank range. He died being nearly torn in half. Wheeler ran about 100 yards before being horribly wounded in a barrage of gunfire but lived long enough to hang with Smith and Wesley shortly afterward when the three were hanged on an elm tree by the mob.\n\nIn the film \"Young Guns II\" Henry Brown was combined with fellow Regulator Jim French and presented as a composite named Hendry William French. Timid and clumsy, the film's portrayal of French by actor Alan Ruck bears little actual resemblance to either outlaw.\n\nThe actor William Smith played Brown in the 1969 episode \"The Restless Man\" of the syndicated television series \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Robert Taylor. In the story line, Brown takes the job of sheriff to tame a lawless town, begins to court a young woman, but returns to his deadly outlaw ways in search of thrills.\n\n"}

He was a prominent figure in the early days of the community, who served his country as a doctor and soldier.\n\nJohannes Palm was born in Heilsbronn to Matthias and Sibylla Palm on July 15, 1713. In 1739, Palm moved to Backnang, near Stuttgart. He married Christina Dorothea Kern on August 2, 1740. After a visit to Amsterdam, Palm began to study medicine in Württemberg. He was most likely aided by relatives, as many physicians and druggists in Württemberg at that time held the Palm family name. Palm left Germany, and arrived in Philadelphia in 1749. He first settled in Northern New Jersey, near Elizabeth. After the death of his wife, he married Catharine Salome Fenger around 1754. He would outlive her as well.\nOn June 17, 1766, Palm secured his plot from Conrad Raisch. Palm was the third owner of the tract since it was surveyed for Johannes Deininger in 1751. This tract can be located today using Railroad St. as the eastern border, Maple St. as the southern border, and the Dauphin County Line as the western border. His house would be in the center of the 100 block on W. Main St.\n\nBy the time the American Revolution broke out in 1775, Palm was 62. Although he felt was too old to take an active part in the revolution, he did participate in the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777. He would later recall how George Washington would encourage his men in battle. Sixteen days after he served at Brandywine, Palm took the Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity before Justice of the Peace John Thomas. Ten other soldiers from the Palmyra area also served in the American Revolution. Their names are recorded and their graves are marked in Bindnagles Cemetery.\n\nPalm had an extensive medical practice. Since the region was still sparsely populated, many of his patients traveled great distances to receive his attention. He had a sophisticated laboratory where he prepared most of his medicines. He distilled his own essential oils and waters from herbs, flowers and other plants. His medical books were mostly from German authors. Palm was baptized and confirmed into the Lutheran Church.\n\nJohannes Palm died on April 25, 1799, in Palmyra, at the age of 85. He had practiced medicine in North America for nearly 50 years.\n\nOn July 24, 1932, American Legion Post No. 72, with the assistance of S. M. Aument of Montoursville, a great-great-great-great granddaughter of Johannes Palm, unveiled a new marker at Palm’s grave at Bindnagle Cemetery, located at Bindnagle Lutheran Church, 801 Gravel Hill Road. On November 20 of that same year, the John Palm Memorial was erected on a small triangle of land on Railroad St. On hand was Dr. Howard Palm of Camden, who was also a direct descendant of Johannes Palm.\n"}

The term is also used to denote a tree in which a kodama supposedly resides. The phenomenon known as yamabiko, when sounds make a delayed echoing effect in mountains and valleys, is sometimes attributed to this kind of spirit, and may also be referred to as \"kodama\".\n\nThese spirits are considered to nimbly bustle about mountains at will. A kodama's outer appearance is very much like an ordinary tree, but if one attempts to cut it down, one would become cursed etc., and it is thus considered to have some kind of mysterious supernatural power. The knowledge of those trees that have kodama living in them is passed down by the elderly of that area over successive generations and they are protected, and it is also said that trees that have a kodama living in them are of certain species. There is also a theory that when old trees are cut, blood could come forth from them.\n\nKodama is also seen as something that can be understood as mountain gods, and a tree god from the old Kojiki, Kukunochi no Kami, has been interpreted as a kodama, and in the Heian period dictionary, the Wamyō Ruijushō, there is a statement on tree gods under the Japanese name \"Kodama\" (古多万). In The Tale of Genji, there are statements such as \"is it an oni, a god (kami), a fox (kitsune), or a tree spirit (kodama)\" and \"the oni of a kodama,\" and thus, it can be seen that kodama are seen to be close to yōkai. They are said to take on the appearance of atmospheric ghost lights, of beasts, and of humans, and there is also a story where a kodama who, in order to meet a human it fell in love with, took on the appearance of a human itself.\n\nIn Aogashima in the Izu Islands, shrines are created at the base of large sugi trees in the mountains and are worshipped to under the name \"kidama-sama\" and \"kodama-sama,\" and thus the vestiges of belief in tree spirits can be seen. Also, in the village of Mitsune on Hachijō-jima, whenever a tree is cut, there was a tradition that one must offer a festival to the tree's spirit \"kidama-sama.\"\n\nOn Okinawa, tree spirits are called \"kiinushii,\" and whenever a tree is cut down, one would first pray to kiinushii and then cut it. Also, when there is an echoing noise of what sounds like a fallen tree at the dead of night, even though there are no actual fallen trees, it is said to be the anguishing voice of kiinushii, and it is said that in times like these, the tree would then wither several days later. The kijimuna, which is known as a yōkai on Okinawa, is also sometimes said to be a type of kiinushii, or a personification of a kiinushii.\n\nIn the collection of yōkai depictions, the \"Gazu Hyakki Yagyō\" by Toriyama Sekien, under the title 木魅 (\"kodama\"), an aged man and woman are depicted standing alongside the trees, and here it is stated that when a tree has passed a hundred years of age, a divine spirit would come dwell inside it, and show its appearance. According to the 13th century Ryōbu Shinto manual \"Reikiki\", kodama can be found in groups in the inner reaches of mountains. They occasionally speak, and can especially be heard when a person dies.\n\nIn modern times, cutting down a tree which houses a kodama is thought to bring misfortune, and such trees are often marked with \"shimenawa\" rope.\n\nKodama are prominently featured in Hayao Miyazaki's anime film \"Princess Mononoke.\" They are portrayed as small, white humanoids with large, rattling heads and mask-like features, with asymmetrical black dots for eyes and mouth (and move similar to bobbleheads).\n\n\n"}

From 1976 to 1978, he played for 1. FC 01 Bamberg in the top-tier level German Basketball Bundesliga. Simonović played for the senior Yugoslav national basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1970 FIBA World Championship. He was also a three time FIBA European Selection.\n\nBorn in Vrnjačka Banja to parents Jevrem Simonović and Ilonka Dobai, both of whom worked as hairdressers, young Ljubodrag grew up in Kraljevo with an older brother Vladimir. Their father Jevrem, a Montenegrin Serb born 1911 in Kolašin whose mother died while giving birth to him and whose father died right after World War I, made a living as a tradesman (in addition to hairdressing he also worked as a seamster and tailor) and over time developed a staunchly communist worldview. Simonović's mother Ilonka, born in 1921, came from a mixed background, born to German mother Ana Schumetz and Hungarian father János Dobay, a left-leaning officer who participated in the ultimately unsuccessful 1919 Hungarian Revolution before fleeing over the border into the recently established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to escape the White Terror of Miklós Horthy. János initially settled in Subotica and eventually in Kraljevo where he worked as a machinist. Duci's mother Ilonka later converted to Orthodox Christianity and took the name Jelena.\n\nAs a kid, Simonović took up chess, which he was taught at age five by his father, an avid player himself. Simonović played the game frequently, later citing it as the first arena in which his competitive nature had been displayed. He also loved playing football. As a freshman at the University of Belgrade, Duci took part in the 1968 student protests.\n\nHe got the nickname Duci after the Hungarian word \"böci\".\n\nSimonović started out with KK Sloga from Kraljevo.\n\nSimonović moved to Belgrade in 1967 at the age of 18 in order to play for KK Crvena zvezda as the latest addition to a talented squad led by 26-year-old Vladimir Cvetković with a slew of up-and-coming youngsters such as 19-year-old small forward Dragan Kapičić and 18-year-old mercurial point guard Zoran Slavnić. Having graduated from the and simultaneous to his duties at the club, Simonović enrolled at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law, attending lectures and studying for exams.\n\nCoached by Milan Bjegojević, Zvezda, somewhat improbably, won the 1968–69 Yugoslav League title in Duci's third season at the club.\n\nWinning the Yugoslav league title meant an automatic qualification to the European Champions Cup for the following 1969–70 season. Starting off well against lesser opposition in the early rounds, Zvezda eventually got into a difficult quarterfinals group, losing all three of its home-and-away ties against Alexander Gomelsky's defending European champion CSKA Moscow, Aca Nikolić's Varese, and even the seeming minnows of the group ASVEL.\n\nOn the domestic front, the club surrendered its title, finishing second to Olimpija as Simonović recorded another stellar season that recommended him for national head coach Ranko Žeravica's Yugoslav national squad at the 1970 FIBA World Championship.\n\nComing off the greatest success of his career, being part of the squad that won the 1970 World Championship, Simonović continued developing his game as Zvezda went through a head coaching change with Đorđe Andrijašević being brought in as replacement to the longtime head coach Bjegojević. Andrijašević wouldn't end up sticking around for long, victim of Zvezda's another indifferent season in the Yugoslav League despite winning the Yugoslav Cup.\n\nIn 1971, Simonović graduated from the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law.\n\nBata Đorđević became the new head coach, infusing new energy into the team by introducing new players Goran Rakočević and Dragiša Vučinić as Zvezda began piling up wins, both in the Yugoslav League and in European Cup Winners' Cup. Simonović, who turned 23 years of age midway through the season, became the team's number one option on offense, putting up tremendous scoring numbers. Among his many stellar displays throughout the season, one stood out — playing away at Hala sportova against the eternal crosstown rivals KK Partizan he scored 59 points. Making this feat even more impressive is the fact that the three-point shot hadn't been implemented yet.\n\nThe season ended dramatically, as Zvezda lost the Cup Winners' Cup final in Thessaloniki 70–74 versus Olimpia Milano in late March 1972 before finishing the domestic league with the identical 17–5 record as KK Split (Jugoplastika), which meant playing a single-game playoff decider for the title. Zvezda won 75–50 thus claiming its second title in three years.\n\nBy the summer of 1972, the Slavnić-Simonović-Kapičić trio had finally seemingly matured and big things were expected in the upcoming season.\n\nDespite Simonović having an incident-filled summer with the national team at the 1972 Olympics, he was initially able to put it behind him and contribute greatly to Zvezda's European Cup run. However, all was not well inside the Zvezda locker room as a simmering rift between local Belgrade-born-and-raised players who came up through the club's youth system (Slavnić and Kapičić) and those brought in from the outside (Simonović and Vučinić) had been gaining in intensity.\n\nCliques were being formed within the squad and things eventually boiled over on 10 January 1973 in Tel Aviv during the away contest versus Maccabi, the first game of the quarterfinals group stage. Zvezda had been leading throughout the game with Duci pouring in baskets from all positions, however, he was not satisfied with the frequency and the quality of passes he's being fed by point guard Slavnić. Slavnić in turn didn't like Simonović's attitude so he decided to stop distributing the ball to him entirely. It wasn't long before Simonović threw a fit, cursing out coach Đorđević right on the floor for not reacting to what's going on, as everything fell apart — despite Simonović scoring 38 points, Zvezda still ended up losing 113–102. Upon returning to Belgrade, Simonović got fined YUD300,000 by Zvezda for \"excessive individualism\" and \"inappropriate behaviour\". Deeply dissatisfied over what had transpired and extremely stung by the fine, right after playing a Yugoslav League game versus KK Željezničar Karlovac, Simonović announced a decision to stop playing basketball, saying he'd like to devote his time and efforts to science, having already been pursuing a master's degree in law after earning an undergraduate law degree two years earlier. Considering Simonović had just turned 24 years of age, the Yugoslav media went into overdrive, speculating on the real reasons for what it considered to be a shocking decision.\n\nSimonović debuted for the senior Yugoslav national basketball team at age 17, going on to make 109 appearances with them in total, and scoring a total of 1,018 points. His playing career ended, while he was a player-coach in Stara Pazova, due to a burst capillary in his throat.\n\nAt the EuroBasket, he played in 23 games, at the FIBA World Cup he played in 6 games, and he also had 4 appearances in the Summer Olympic Games, and 15 at the Balkan Games. All together, he won 6 gold medals and 2 silver medals. For Red Star Belgrade, he wore number 11 while for the national team, he wore number 5.\n\nThe Yugoslav national team arrived to Munich, for the 1972 Summer Olympics, as the reigning world champions from Ljubljana 1970, and still hoping to win one of the medals, though the team was quite changed. The team's victory over Italy, 85–78, at the beginning of the tournament improved their expectations, but in the second round, the Yugoslav team was defeated by Puerto Rico, by a score of 79–74.\n\nIt was later proven that two players from the Puerto Rican side had used illegal doping substances, prompting a protest from the Yugoslav players. Simonović however (aged 23), was ejected from the team, upon continuing to protest after the Yugoslav players had been silenced. Yugoslavia eventually finished 5th in the tournament.\n\nAfter his retirement from sport he has written various books, including: \"Rebellion of Robots\", \"Professionalism or Socialism\", \"Olympic Deception of the ‘divine baron’ – Pierre de Coubertin.\" His books center around a critique of Olympism and professional sports.\n\nHe authored a piece about the mystery behind the 1987 death of German heptathlete Birgit Dressel at the age of 27.\n\n\nSimonović is married and has three children.\n\nHe earned his Magister degree in law from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law and a Doctorate in philosophy from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy.\n\n\n"}

She is credited with coining the term \"software engineering\". Hamilton was Director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for the Apollo space program. In 1986, she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language based on her paradigm of Development Before the Fact (DBTF) for systems and software design.\n\nHamilton has published over 130 papers, proceedings, and reports about the 60 projects and six major programs in which she has been involved.\n\nOn November 22, 2016, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President Barack Obama for her work leading the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.\n\nMargaret Heafield was born in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington). After graduating from Hancock High School in 1954, she studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from Earlham College in 1958. She briefly taught high school mathematics and French upon graduation, in order to support her husband while he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard, with the ultimate goal of pursuing a graduate degree at a later time. She moved to Boston, Massachusetts, with the intention of doing graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University. She cites a female math professor as helping her desire to pursue abstract mathematics. She had other inspirations outside the technological world, including her father, the philosopher and poet, and her grandfather, a school headmaster and Quaker Minister. She says these men inspired her to a minor in philosophy. In 1960 she took an interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers (at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC) for professor Edward Norton Lorenz in the meteorology department. Hamilton wrote that at that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1963, she worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at Lincoln Lab, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), to search for unfriendly aircraft; she also wrote software for the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.\n\nThe SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, started by MIT, to create a computer system that could predict weather systems and track their movements through simulators; SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense from potential Soviet attacks during the Cold War. Hamilton said, \n\nWhat they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work.\n\nIt was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.\n\nHamilton then joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT, which at the time was working on the Apollo space mission. She eventually led a team credited with developing the software for Apollo and Skylab. Hamilton's team was responsible for developing in-flight software, which included algorithms designed by various senior scientists for the Apollo command module, lunar lander, and the subsequent Skylab. Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software which included the error detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display Interface Routines (AKA the Priority Displays) which Hamilton designed and developed. She worked to gain hands-on experience during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and software engineering courses did not exist.\n\nHer areas of expertise include systems design and software development, enterprise and process modelling, development paradigm, formal systems modeling languages, system-oriented objects for systems modelling and development, automated life-cycle environments, methods for maximizing software reliability and reuse, domain analysis, correctness by built-in language properties, open-architecture techniques for robust systems, full life-cycle automation, quality assurance, seamless integration, error detection and recovery techniques, man-machine interface systems, operating systems, end-to-end testing techniques, and life-cycle management techniques.\n\nIn one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, the Apollo Guidance Computer together with the on-board flight software averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before the Lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. The computer was overloaded with interrupts caused by incorrectly phased power supplied to the lander's rendezvous radar. The program alarms indicated \"executive overflows\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. The asynchronous executive designed by J. Halcombe Laning was used by Hamilton's team to develop asynchronous flight software:\n\nBecause of the flight software's system-software's error detection and recovery techniques that included its system-wide \"kill and recompute\" from a \"safe place\" restart approach to its snapshot and rollback techniques, the Display Interface Routines (AKA the priority displays) together with its man-in-the-loop capabilities were able to be created in order to have the capability to interrupt the astronauts' normal mission displays with priority displays of critical alarms in case of an emergency. This depended on our assigning a unique priority to every process in the software in order to ensure that all of its events would take place in the correct order and at the right time relative to everything else that was going on.\nHamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays to warn them that there was an emergency \"giving the astronauts a go/no go decision (to land or not to land)\". Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer in mission control, recognized the meaning of the errors that were presented to the astronauts by the priority displays and shouted, \"Go, go!\" And on they went. Dr. Paul Curto, senior technologist who nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called Hamilton's work \"the foundation for ultra-reliable software design.\"\n\nHamilton wrote of the incident,\n\nFrom 1976 through 1984, Hamilton was the CEO of a company she co-founded called Higher Order Software (HOS) to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from her experience at MIT. They created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology developed at MIT. It was successfully used in numerous government projects. One notable project was to formalize and implement the first computable IDEF, C-IDEF for the Air Force, based on HOS as its formal foundation.\n\nOne critical assessment contended that, apart from a few independent reviews, the HOS methodology generated little analysis except among consultants associated with the company. That evaluation, conducted by a consultant for the United States Navy asserted that \"the HOS literature tends to advertise their ideas and products more than making a contribution in substance to the field of Computer Science.\" Edsgar Dijkstra described the USE.IT software as \"mechanized aids for the application of obsolete techniques.\" A detailed analysis of the HOS theory and AXES language was used by Harel to develop a derived language for a more modern form of structured programming derived from HOS called the And/Or programming language from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals. Referring to Dijkstra's classic work on structured programming, Harel states:\n\"As will become clear, the \"layers\" in which the program is arranged, these being in the heart of the idea of structured programming, correspond to the levels of the tree.\"\nHarel goes on to show at that time how HOS and his derived And/Or programming language relates to mathematical logic, game theory and artificial intelligence. Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers. and to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems\n\nHamilton left the company, HOS, in 1985. In March 1986, she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of Development Before The Fact (DBTF) for systems design and software development.\n\nMargaret H. Hamilton \"is the person who came up with the idea of naming the discipline, \"software engineering\", as a way of giving it legitimacy.\" According to Hamilton:\nDuring this time at MIT, she wanted to give their software \"legitimacy\", just like with other engineering disciplines, so that it (and those building it) would be given its due respect; and, as a result she made up the term \"software engineering\" to distinguish it from other kinds of engineering.\n\nHamilton details how she came about to make up the term \"software engineering\":\n\nWhen I first came up with the term, no one had heard of it before, at least in our world. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. Not because of his acceptance of the new 'term' per se, but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right.\n\nWhen Hamilton started using the term \"software engineering\", software engineering was not taken seriously compared to other engineering, nor was it regarded as a science. She began to use the term \"software engineering\" during the early Apollo missions in order to give software the legitimacy of other fields such as hardware engineering. Over time the term \"software engineering\" has gained the same respect as any other discipline.\n\n\"At MIT she assisted in the creation of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer\". Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important role in getting humans to the moon. “She, along with that other early programming pioneer, CoBOL inventor Grace Hopper, also deserve tremendous credit for helping to open the door for more women to enter and succeed in STEM fields like software.”\n\n\n\nMargaret met her husband, James Cox Hamilton, while at Earlham College. They married in the late 1950s after Hamilton earned her bachelor's degree. They have a daughter, Lauren, as well as two grandchildren. According to her daughter, Margaret was the homecoming queen at Earlham College and James was the class president. During the weekends she would often take her daughter to the lab to allow her to spend time with her daughter. While her daughter slept on the office floor, Margaret programmed away, creating routines that would ultimately be added to the Apollo's command module computer\". Margaret and James eventually divorced. Their daughter Lauren married billionaire Cox heir James Cox Chambers on October 9, 1982. They have a son, James Cox \"Jim\" Chambers Jr. The two later divorced and Lauren married Richard David Selesnick, with whom she has a son, Mac.\n\n\n\n"}

His age is disputed and his birth name is not confirmed - all that is known of him are the promotional photographs taken during his time as a member of Silencer, in which his face is entirely covered by bloodied bandages, one photo from a newspaper after his brother's suicide, and some later self-released photos in which his face is also obscured. He was born in Markaryd, Småland, Sweden.\n\nVirtually nothing is known about Nattramn that predates Silencer's existence as a band.\n\nSilencer was formed in 1995 as a solo project of guitarist/bassist Andreas Casado, under the pseudonym Leere. At some point prior to 1998, Nattramn was enlisted as the band's vocalist and lyricist. With this lineup, they recorded and released a single demo track with session drummer Jonas Mattsson. Following this, Silencer recorded and released the full-length album Death - Pierce Me.\n\nWhile recording the vocal parts on the album, Nattramn allegedly self-harmed; cutting his wrists and hands. This contributed to his unique high-pitched wailing vocal style, which has been described as sounding like a dying animal.\n\nAfter the release of this album, it is rumoured that Nattramn entered , a psychiatric hospital located in Växjö, although the circumstances surrounding his admission, and whether he was sectioned or went voluntarily, are subject to conjecture. It is said that following his stay, Nattramn chose to continue to live in Växjö.\n\nAfter several years of inactivity, he created the dark ambient solo project Diagnose: Lebensgefahr and released an album, entitled Transformalin, in 2007. In 2012, he released a new piece of music entitled \"Ödelagt\", under the project name Trencadis. This 21-minute piece is described as the beginning of Nattramn's musical career, and was initially written and recorded several years prior to his joining Silencer. The track was said to have been written in 1994, under the project name Sinneskross, and is also in a dark ambient style which has been described as being reminiscent of Burzum.\n\nHe wrote a book, which was released in September 2011, entitled \"Grishjärta\" or \"Pig's Heart\".

Nisbah is originally an Arabic word that was passed to many other languages such as Turkish, Persian and Urdu.\n\nIn the usage of Persian, Turkish and Urdu, it is pronounced/written exclusively \"nisbat\". In Arabic usage, that pronunciation occurs when the word is uttered in its construct state only.\n\nThe practice has been adopted in Iranian names and South Asian Muslim names. The nisba has sometimes become a surname.\n\nA \"nisba\" \"relation\" is a grammatical term referring to the suffixation of masculine -\"iyy\", feminine \"-iyyah\" to a word to make it an adjective. As an example, the word \"‘Arabiyy\" () means \"Arab, related to Arabic, Arabian\". Nisba forms are very common in Arabic names.\n\nTraditional Arabic names do not include family names or surnames, but rather patronymics (\"nasab\"), where the name of the person is followed by the name of his father, usually linked by \"ibn\" or \"bin\" ('son'). Patronymics may be long as they may include all known forefathers. When a name is simplified to one or two ancestors, it may become confused with other persons' names, so an additional specifier, a \"nisba\", may be added as an attribute.\n\nA nisba is usually prefixed by \"al\" ('the') and may be to almost anything:\n\n\n\n\n\nOne can have more than one nisba, one can be related to a city, a clan, a profession and a person at the same time.

The capital of the province is the city of Phôngsali. Phôngsali is located between Yunnan (China), and Điện Biên Province in Vietnam. Its culture has thus been historically heavily influenced by China.\n\nPhongsali Province covers an area of , out of which 77% has forest cover. The province borders China to the north and west, Vietnam to the east, Luang Prabang Province to the south, and Oudomxai Province to the southwest. The highest mountain in the province is Phou Doychy with an elevation of Protected areas in the province include the Phou Dene Din National Biodiversity Conservation Area and Nam Lan Conservation Area. Agriculture is the mainstay of the people of the province. Phôngsali is the primary trade gateway between Laos and China, exporting lumber and importing several types of finished goods.\n\nThe Phu Noi left Muang Sing or Burma and arrived in Phongsaly at the end of the 18th century. The Hmong settled in Phongsaly at the end of the 19th century, having migrated from southern China. In 1895, a Sino-French treaty transferred the Tai Lue's Sip Song Phan Na principalities of Phongsaly and Muang Sing to French Laos. Between 1908 and 1910, the Tai Lue conducted a revolt against colonial authority. When it ended, the colonial military assumed full authority in Phongsaly. In 1936, Sithon Kommadam and his brother, Kamphanh were jailed in Phongsaly because of their participation in their father's (Ong Kommandam) 1934–1936 armed revolt against the French. After Sithon's release in 1945, he established resistance bases in Phongsaly, soon making contact with the Viet Minh. The Communists came into power in 1954 in the province; within six years, the Phunoy began experiencing Buddhist religious purges. Subsequent to the 1954 Geneva Accords, Communist Pathet Lao forces in Phongsaly province were provided with regrouping zones. Phongsaly was integrated into the Royal Lao Government on December 18, 1957.\n\nPhongsali Province covers an area of , out of which 77% has forest cover. The province borders China to the north and west, Vietnam to the east, Luang Prabang Province to the south, and Oudomxai Province to the southwest. It is located high in the mountains, approximately above sea level. The highest mountain in the province is Phou Doychy with an elevation of . The Phou Fa hill, at , is near the capital city and has road access to the top from where vistas of the city are viewable. The top of the mountain is also approached by 431 steps. Because of economic commerce with China, large portions of the province have been deforested.\n\nPhongsali is characterized by a relatively cool climate. Weather in the province is described as “four seasons in a single day” with cold mornings and evenings, humidity during the day, and rains in the afternoon, which has created lush green forests.\n\nLarge areas of the province’s forests in Phou Den Din NBCA have plentiful wildlife but no human habitation.\n\nThe 126,880 hectare Phou Dendin Important Bird Area (IBA) is located within the 222,000 hectare Phou Den Din NBCA. The IBA altitude varies between above sea level. Topographical elements include the Nam Ou River and its catchment, the area at the confluence of the Nam Khang River, mountainous terrain, and slopes. The habitat is characterized by unbroken dry evergreen forest and inland wetlands. Notable avifauna includes Blyth's kingfisher (\"Alcedo hercules\"), brown dipper (\"Cinclus pallasii\"), brown hornbill (\"Anorrhinus tickelli\"), crested kingfisher (\"Megaceryle lugubris\"), great hornbill (\"Buceros bicornis\"), lesser fish eagle (\"Ichthyophaga humilis\"), and rufous-necked hornbill (\"Aceros nipalensis\").\n\nThe province is made up of the following districts \"(mueang)\":\n\nThe northernmost district of the province is Yot Ou, which has a population of 31,000 spread over 98 villages made up of 11 ethnic groups. The majority of the people are agriculturists. The Lao-Chinese Border Checkpoint is at Lan Tui, which is designated by landmark No. 7.\n\nThe population of the province is 165,926 as of the March 2005 census. There are 13 minority ethnic groups with independent language and culture identity: Khammu, Thai Dam, Thai Daeng, Yao, Leu, Hor, Hmong, Akha, Yang, Bid, Lolo and others. Each group has its own practices in respect to marriage customs as well as specific handicrafts, silverware and jewelry.\n\nOther than the national language Lao, various minority languages are spoken in Phongsaly province, most of which belong to the Tai (Tai-Kadai), Hanoish (Tibeto-Burman), and Khmuic (Austroasiatic) branches. The table below lists the languages surveyed in Kingsada (1999), Shintani (2001), and Kato (2008), with autonyms and informant birth places given as well. All languages are spoken in Phongsaly province unless indicated otherwise.\n\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the people of the province. Phôngsali is the primary trade gateway between Laos and China, exporting lumber and importing several types of finished goods. There are also several Chinese manufacturing companies in the province, along with other foreign investment.\n\nAs an economic activity 24 villages have been identified to install mini hydro-power projects with pico-turbines to provide electric supply utilizing the hydro power potential of the hilly areas which have good monsoon rainfall. Local material will be used for construction of civil works and villagers trained to plan, implement and operate the units including maintenance of all components of the project covering transmission lines also. The objective is to reduce poverty among the rural poor of the remote villages. The project is proposed for implementation at a cost of Euro 210,000 with 48% financing by the Energy and Environment Partnership (EEP)of Mekong with Electriciens Sand Frontieres as lead partner. The project is slated for implementation over a 20 months period.\n\nIn order to reduce the addiction to opium, the United Nations Organization on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) introduced the Phongsaly Alternative Development Fund Project for Opium Elimination covering 30 villages in Khoua and Mai districts, and also minimise opium addiction in 60 villages in Samphan district, through alternative development activities. During the final years of the 20th century, 3,872 ha of the province had opium poppy cultivation (20% of the national total production) with 513 villages out of 611 growing opium with an addiction rate of 5.6%. In spite of government ban on opium poppy cultivation, Phongsaly has the maximum number of districts below the poverty line, and is one of the major opium producing provinces in the country.\n\nImportant landmarks in the province are the Wat Ou-Tai Temple, the Wat Luang Ou-Neua Temple and the That Phou Xay Stupa.\n\nThe Wat Ou-Tai Temple is in the Ban Ou- Tai village. It was built by Praya Chakkawattiraja and is said to be 500 years old. The Hor Thane Keo, inside the monastery, is a specific sanctum where Buddha images are deified. This sanctum is built with mud and has many types of decorations retained in its original form. The wooden columns of the shrine are supported over on stone blocks; these also have been elegantly designed and painted with drawings of daggers, swords, flowers and flags, and all carved in wood. There is a shrine built in brick masonry within the monastery complex which is called “ Ou Bo Sot” (meaning a place where monks meet and conduct religious rites) by the Tai Lue ethnic groups.\n\nWat Luang Ou-Neua Temple is also an old and highly revered temple built about 500 years ago in Ban Ou Neua village. The temple has a double overlapping roof in the Lue architecture style and is very impressive. The temple is adorned with traditional fine art techniques and houses A large Buddha image and small Buddha statues are deified inside this temple.\n\nThat Phou Xay Stupa is at the top of a hill, approached by walking up 400 steps.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41946096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41946096", "title": "Ruzbahan", "text": "Ruzbahan\n\nRuzbahan ibn Vindadh-Khurshid (), better known as Ruzbahan (also spelled as Rezbahan), was a Daylamite military officer who served the Buyid dynasty. A native of Daylam, Ruzbahan began serving the Buyids at an unknown date and quickly rose into high ranks. After constant pressure from king Mu'izz al-Dawla to conquer Batihah, he, along with his two brothers, started a rebellion lasting from 955 to 957. After the end of the rebellion, Ruzbahan was imprisoned and shortly executed.\n\nRuzbahan was the son of a certain Vindadh-Khurshid, and had two brothers named Asfar and Bullaka. Like his Buyid overlords, Ruzbahan was a Daylamite. However, unlike the Buyids, he probably belonged to a family of noble origin. When the Buyid ruler Mu'izz al-Dawla conquered Iraq in 945, Ruzbahan was appointed as the tax collector of the Sawad. Ruzbahan was originally a low rank officer who served a Buyid officer named Musa Fayadhah. However, under Mu'izz al-Dawla he rapidly rose to higher ranks and became a favourite of Mu'izz al-Dawla.\n\nIn 948/949, during negotiations between Mu'izz al-Dawla's and the Sallarid ruler Marzuban's ambassadors, Marzuban was greatly insulted, and became enraged; he tried to avenge himself by marching towards Ray, which was under the control of Mu'izz al-Dawla's brother Rukn al-Dawla. Rukn al-Dawla, however, managed to trick and slow Marzuban down by diplomatic means, while he was receiving aid from Mu'izz al-Dawla, who sent an army under Sebük-Tegin, which also included other officer such as Ruzbahan, Burarish, Ibrahim ibn al-Mutawwaq, 'Ammar \"the Mad\", and Ahmad ibn Salih Kilabi. However, when the army was close to Dinavar, Burarish, who disliked Sebük-Tegin and refused to obey the orders of the latter, mutinied along with most of the Daylamites in the army, except Ruzbahan and other Daylamite officers. Burarish shortly heavily wounded Sebük-Tegin, who, however, managed to flee from the latter. For unknown reasons, Burarish shortly fled, but was quickly captured by the supporters of Sebük-Tegin. The army of Sebük-Tegin then continued to Ray, and at the same time, reinforcements arrived from Shiraz. Rukn al-Dawla shortly managed to defeat and capture Marzuban.\n\nIn 949, Mu'izz al-Dawla sent Ruzbahan on an expedition against the Batihah ruler 'Imran ibn Shahin. Ruzbahan discovered 'Imran's location and attacked him, but was heavily defeated and forced to withdraw. 'Imran then became even more bold, with his subjects demanding protection money from anyone, including government officials, that crossed their path, and the path to Basra by water was effectively closed off. Mu'izz al-Dawla, after receiving numerous complaints from his officers, sent another army in 950 or 951, under the joint command of Ruzbahan and the amir's vizier al-Muhallabi.\n\nRuzbahan, who disliked the vizier, convinced him to directly attack 'Imran. He kept his forces in the rear and fled as soon as fighting between the two sides began. 'Imran used the terrain effectively, laying ambushes and confusing al-Muhallabi's army. Many of the vizier's soldiers died in the fighting and he himself only narrowly escaped capture, swimming to safety. Mu'izz al-Dawla then came to terms with 'Imran, acceding to his terms. Prisoners were exchanged and 'Imran was made a vassal of the Buyids, being instated as governor of the Batihah.\n\nPeace lasted for approximately five years between the two sides. During this period, a marriage was being arranged between a daughter of Ruzbahan and Mu'izz al-Dawla's son Izz al-Dawla. A false rumor of Mu'izz al-Dawla's death in 955, however, prompted 'Imran to seize a Buyid convoy traveling from Ahvaz to Baghdad. Mu'izz demanded that the items confiscated be returned, at which point 'Imran returned the money gained, but kept the goods taken. Ruzbahan was then for a third time sent to the swamp, but shortly revolted along with his brother Asfar and spared 'Imran from a new attack. Ruzbahan's other brother, Bullaka, joined the rebellion and revolted at Shiraz. Ruzbahan was further joined by the Daylamite soldiers of al-Muhallabi. Ruzbahan quickly marched towards Ahvaz, where al-Muhallabi was preparing a counter-attack. However, the troops of al-Muhallabi quickly deserted him and joined Ruzbahan. Ruzbahan then marched towards Mu'izz al-Dawla, who sent an army under his Daylamite general Shirzil, who, however, shortly, along with his army, joined the rebellion of Ruzbahan. In 956, Mu'izz al-Dawla left Baghdad in order to fight Ruzbahan himself. Meanwhile, the Hamdanid ruler Nasir al-Dawla used this opportunity to seize Baghdad.\n\nIn 957, Ruzbahan fought a final battle against Mu'izz al-Dawla. Ruzbahan almost managed to win the battle, but was defeated by Mu'izz al-Dawla's \"ghulams\". The defeat marked the end of Ruzbahan's rebellion. Ruzbahan was captured during the battle and was imprisoned in a fortress known as Sarat. \n\nThe Daylamite supporters of Ruzbahan then began planning to capture the fortress and rescue Ruzbahan. However, Abu'l-Abbas Musafir, an officer of Mu'izz al-Dawla, managed to discover of the Daylamite's plan, and quickly urged Mu'izz al-Dawla to have Ruzbahan killed. Mu'izz al-Dawla, however, did not agree with him. A number of Mu'izz al-Dawla's officer shortly told him the same, which made him agree with them. When it became night, the guards of Mu'izz al-Dawla took Ruzbahan to the Tigris river, where he was drowned.\n\n"}

She is a Professor of Media Studies at the University of Turku, and was a visiting scholar at MIT in 2016. She gained her PhD from the University of Turku in 2002; her dissertation was on gender and the popularization of the internet, which was later published through Peter Lang. After holding positions at the universities of Tampere, Jyväskylä and Helsinki, Paasonen was appointed Professor of Media Studies at the University of Turku on 1 August 2011, and publishes on internet research, media theory, sexuality, pornography and affect.\n\nOn Monday, 4 April 2016, Paasonen gave a lecture at Brown University in the USA on the politics and culture of online porn. In the essay, \"Glimmers of the forbidden fruit: Reminiscing pornography, conceptualizing the archive,\" written along with Katariina Kyrölä, Paasonen traces the evolution of the \"porn stash\" from a physical collection to a digital one, and in doing so, examines cyberporn as a site of identity formation. She and Kyrölä suggest that pornography occasions the accumulation of a somatic archive, which are \"not merely reservoirs of extra-cognitive sensation but also knowingly curated, reflected upon and reworked: they are simultaneously material and semiotic, intimate and culturally specific, affective and open to representation.\" In her lecture at Brown, Paasonen suggested that digital pornography must not be understood as something that creeps into society from the outside, but rather as something that already exists in contemporary culture. She writes, \"Encounters with pornography therefore become incorporated as carnal capacity-- as what we can imagine our bodies enjoying and being capable of, or not enjoying and being capable of.\" Paasonen argues, therefore, that interactions with pornography, therefore, can contribute to the development of an individual's sexual identity.\n\nThe Finnish Academy of Science awarded her the Jutikkala Prize of €15,000 14 October 2011. In the same year Paasonen published the book, \"Carnal Resonance: Affect and Online Pornography\", through MIT Press.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their investigations combine advanced tools and skills ranging from the intuitive and psychic to high-tech environmental monitoring. Collected evidence is researched using genealogy and historical societies, and when required, the sdGH's association of archaeologists and published historians.\n\nsdGH is proud of its premium reputation. So impressed with its respectful investigation protocol, the team is regularly re-invited to investigate invaluable landmarks and has been tapped by San Diego's infamous Whaley House Museum to conduct monthly public paranormal investigation tours. Long considered to be one of America's most haunted, The Whaley House has been noted as such by past US Commerce Department promotional material.\n\nWith the team's unique mix of intuitive and psychic talent, extensive high-tech environmental monitoring, historical research, and many media appearances including television's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, the Travel Channel Network, and The Biography Channel, The San Diego Ghost Hunters has become the go-to group for all things paranormal throughout historical San Diego and Southern California.\n\nsdGH's services are complimentary to its clients. No monetary charges are made or donations accepted, and no merchandise of any kind is sold from the team's site. This keeps commerce and their work fully separate, a dynamic sdGH feels is critical for investigative integrity.\n\nIn addition to a multitude of Whaley House Museum investigations, The San Diego Ghost Hunters have focused its attention on a long list of fascinating locations including: The Queen Mary Historic Ship, Long Beach, CA; David Oman House, Cielo Drive, Hollywood, CA—40th Anniversary Date of Sharon Tate Murders; Lizzie Borden House, Fall River, MA; Birdcage Theater, Tombstone, AZ; Villisca Axe Murder House, Villisca, IA; Hotel del Coronado, Coronado, CA; Waverly Hills Sanatorium, Louisville, KY. Since 2004, sdGH has regularly investigated San Diego Maritime Museum, The Star of India. The team's two appearances many years ago on Southern California television featured its work on the historic ship and helped ignite the attention she enjoys today within the paranormal community. At a later date, an episode of television's Ghost Hunters was filmed at the location.\n\nSince its founding, The San Diego Ghost Hunters has taken a special interest in the San Diego Whaley House Museum. It symbolizes all that drives the team: A premier national historic landmark that enjoys recognition around the globe as one of America's most haunted locations. Built in 1857 by businessman Thomas Whaley, the Greek revival-style house became a driving force in early San Diego as it housed at different times a general store, granary, morgue, courthouse, and the town's first public theater during its commercial years. It seems after 150 years, Mr. Whaley and his family still are looking after the house as experiences of the paranormal kind are reported on an almost daily basis. After working closely with sdGH on various historical projects and recognizing the respectful protocol the team brings to its investigations, museum management asked sdGH to co-host monthly Paranormal Investigation Tours in the fall of 2008.\n\nSince fall 2008, The San Diego Ghost Hunters have co-hosted Whaley House Museum Paranormal Investigation Tours, the first event of its kind offered in San Diego. Presented late night on the last weekend of each month, an intimate number of guest investigators learn about the historical family that built the legendary home and helped establish San Diego as an emerging city, are introduced to paranormal investigation tools and techniques, then put them to use to discover why the US Department of Commerce has published the Whaley House as a haunted location within vintage promotional material. sdGH provides its co-host duties on a volunteer-basis—as a service to the community. One hundred percent of all ticket fees collected are applied to the maintenance and restoration of the museum and historical advocacy programs. The tours have been very popular with sell-outs occurring every month for over three years, at times before tour dates are publicly announced. In late summer 2011, sdGH and museum management shook hands to extend their tour partnership through 2012.\n\nBeing a premier Southern California investigation team, The San Diego Ghost Hunters has been tapped for media consultation since its founding. Appearances have included The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Travel Channel's Halloween special \"Most Terrifying Places in America\", The Bio Channel's \"My Ghost Story\", a multitude of Southern California television news broadcasts and morning shows, newspaper features, technical consultation with VH1 Network, and contributions to books detailing haunted locations and stories edited by popular author, historian, archeologist Robert Wlodarski and acclaimed author Troy Taylor. Team members have also been featured on numerous radio programs including those on the Haunted Voices Radio Network and BIM Paranormal Radio.\n\n"}

In 1956, he was acquired by the Washington Senators organization, and he would spend the rest of his baseball career in the employ of the franchise (which became the Minnesota Twins in 1961). Morgan played for the Senators' Double-A farm club, the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association, from 1956 through mid-1960. As a 28-year-old veteran, Morgan had his best minor-league season for the 1957 Lookouts, batting .332 with 14 home runs and 92 RBI and making the SA all-star team as an outfielder.\n\nMorgan would play in the minor leagues for 15 seasons and bat .301 in 5,273 at bats, but he never made Washington's Major League roster and in 1961 he became a manager in the newly relocated Twins' farm system. Morgan managed for eight seasons in the Alabama–Florida League, Northern League and Carolina League — compiling a won/loss mark of 488–540 (.475) — until he was appointed to the Minnesota MLB coaching staff for 1969. He served as the Twins' first base coach for almost seven seasons, until he was forced to the sidelines by kidney disease in September 1975. Morgan received a kidney transplant during the autumn of 1975, but his body rejected it and he died in Minneapolis at the age of 47.\n\n"}
