Tzigara, Tzigara-Sumurcaș, Tzigara-Samurcash, Tzigara-Samurkasch or Țigara-Samurcaș; April 4, 1872 – April 1, 1952) was a Romanian art historian, ethnographer, museologist and cultural journalist, also known as local champion of art conservation, Romanian Police leader and pioneer radio broadcaster. Tzigara was a member of the \"Junimea\" literary society, holding positions at the National School of Fine Arts, the University of Bucharest and lastly the University of Cernăuți. During his youth, he was secretary to Carol I, the King of Romania. Close to the royal family, he also served as head of the Carol I Academic Foundation, where he set up a large collection of photographic plates. Tzigara achieved fame in 1906 as founder of the \"National Museum\", nucleus of the present-day Museum of the Romanian Peasant, but was also involved in arranging and preserving the Theodor Aman art fund.\n\nDuring World War I, Tzigara-Samurcaș irritated Romanian public opinion by accepting to serve in a puppet administration set up by the Central Powers. Although his conduct was considered benign by the legitimate government, it drew him accusations of collaborationism from within academia, and aggravated his long-standing conflict with historian Nicolae Iorga. Tzigara was prevented from advancing in his university career over the interwar period, but compensated for this mishap with other achievements: he was a delegate to several world fairs, the first-ever lecturer on Radio Romania's staff, the editor in chief of \"Convorbiri Literare\" magazine, and, shortly before retirement, a corresponding member of the Academy. His post-World War II years were spent in obscurity, owing to his ideological incompatibility with the Romanian communist regime.\n\nAlexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș was alleged to be Carol I's illegitimate son, a rumor fueled by his closeness to court. He was himself the father of artist Ana Tzigara Berza, and father in law of folklorist Marcu Berza.\n\nA native of Bucharest, Tzigara-Samurcaș was born on , and baptized into the Romanian Orthodox Church. A popular rumor has him as the illegitimate son of \"Domnitor\" Carol I, the future King of Romania, to whom Tzigara was especially close in later years. Historian Lucian Boia gives some credit to this piece of oral history, and notes that Tzigara, like Wilhelm and Mite Kremnitz, had \"an unusually tight relationship\" with the royal family. Researcher Zigu Ornea, who notes that Tzigara may have been spreading the story around, argues: \"This legend is naturally hard to verify but, in any case, it is a possible one, since Tzigara-Samurcaș was born in 1872 and Carol I was present on our throne, as \"Domnitor\", from 1866.\" Like Boia, Ornea notes that Tzigara's close relationship with the king, the king's repeated interventions on his behalf \"every time [Tzigara's career] got stuck\", and his contacts with the Kremnitzes (including Mite, Carol's alleged mistress) were some additional clues to a royal bloodline. Historian Vasile Docea criticizes Ornea's verdict, noting that it relies on questionable sources, and argues that, far from embracing this legend, Tzigara spoke \"with evident pride\" about his Tzigara roots. According to historian Lucian Nastasă, Docea effectively \"disproved\" the rumor of Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcașs royal descent.\n\nAlexandru's mother and Carol's alleged mistress was Elena Samurcaș, married to Toma Tzigara. Research into his maternal genealogy led the art historian to conclude that he was of noble Greek and Italo-Greek descent: his supposed ancestor was \"Spatharios\" Zotos Tzigaras, buried in Venice at San Giorgio dei Greci (1599). The Samurcaș family had aristocratic blood, being related to the boyar nobility of Wallachia: the art historian's paternal line made him a relative of the Kretzulescu, Rallet, Bengescu and Crețeanu boyar families.\nAlso of boyar rank, Alexandru's Samurcaș ancestors had a history on both sides of the Southern Carpathians, in Wallachia and in then-Austrian-ruled Transylvania. Active during the Age of Revolution, Wallachian \"Vornic\" Constantin Samurcaș took part in Eterist agitation, but later, fleeing the 1821 rural uprising, settled in Kronstadt (Brașov) to spy for the Austrians. Another ancestor, \"Postelnic\" Alecu Samurcaș, was a linguist, known for his work in the Greek language. The meeting of two branches was recorded in the coat of arms that Tzigara-Samurcaș fashioned for himself, showing the \"spatha\" of Zotos Tzigaras, alongside a sable (Romanian: \"samur\") and a stylized eyebrow.\n\nA while after Toma Tzigara's death, Alexandru was adopted by his childless uncle Ioan Alecu Samurcaș (he officially took the name \"Tzigara-Samurcaș\" years later, in 1899); he was also helped with his education by the Kremnitzes, who taught him German, introduced him to high society circles, and regarded him as a son. His first contacts with history and folk art came by means of his extended family, which collected and preserved documents and art objects.\n\nAfter graduating from the Matei Basarab High School and taking his Baccalaureate, he enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, Historical Section. It was here that the young man was acquainted with his first mentors: writer-collector Alexandru Odobescu and archeologist Grigore Tocilescu, the latter of whom ensured Tzigara's employment as custodian for the National Museum of Antiquities. He was a critic of the museum's underdevelopment under Tocilescu's management, and wrote that the disorganized collection comprised an Egyptian mummy, copies of frescoes from the Cathedral Church in Curtea de Argeș, items from the Pietroasele Treasure, and works of Precolumbian art, alongside a scale model of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nFrom 1893, the young graduate was in the German Empire, where he studied at the University of Berlin and the Ludwig Maximilian University, taking his Ph.D. in Munich with a dissertation on the Baroque painter Simon Vouet. He received his diploma, \"magna cum laude\". Tzigara-Samurcaș returned to his home country and, following a dispute with Tocilescu, gave up his position at the Antiquities Museum. He later specialized in museology in Paris, hearing lectures at the \"École des Beaux-Arts\" and working for city museums, before returning to Germany, where he studied with the preeminent Brunswickian curator Wilhelm von Bode.\n\nBack in Romania, Tzigara unsuccessfully applied for the Archeology Chair created at the University of Iași, but lost; according to scholar and diarist Teohari Antonescu, who emerged as the victor, the competition was rigged in his own favor, even though Tzigara \"had the good sense to come prepared.\" From 1899, he was librarian of the Carol I Academic Foundation and Professor of Aesthetics and Art History at the National School of Fine Arts. As Tzigara later acknowledged, his introduction to royalty came through a relationship with the Kremnitzes, his neighbors on Polonă Street, Dorobanți. This period saw the start of Tzigara's close relationship with Carol, whom the art historian later called \"my most generous protector\" and \"the sovereign \"\"\". Received into royal circles, he was a confidant of the Queen Consort and cultural patron, Elisabeth of Wied, whom he called \"the animator of Romanian art\". For a while, he was her private secretary, helping her fulfill her literary ambitions under the \"Carmen Sylva\" signature. Tzigara's recollections speak with enthusiasm about Elisabeth's works, as well as about the king's dislike for her interests in spiritism or philosophy, and discuss Carol's enduring affection for Mite Kremnitz.\n\nIn order to support his lectures at the Fine Arts School, Tzigara began gathering photographic plates, a collection which grew in size over the following decades. It includes images of European monuments and works of art, as well as samples of Romanian architecture (in some cases, the only surviving images of since-demolished buildings) and copies of maps. The images of local life are considered of particular importance, since they document the Westernization and modernization of Romania's landscape. Mostly anonymous works, they most likely include some of Tzigara's own photographs. A few of them were inventoried by Editura Casa Școalelor, and some were published, in Tzigara's lifetime, by \"Buletinul Comisiunii Monumentelor Istorice\" or other Romanian scientific magazines. His image projections at the Carol I Foundation, supporting a students' elective course on sculpture and painting, became one of the better-known student summer activities.\n\nThe young scholar was at the time also interested in the development of decorative arts, which he wanted to reflect the local tradition of handicrafts and notions of national specificity. According to art historian Ioana Vlasiu, Tzigara and painter-researcher Abgar Baltazar were in part responsible for fusing local folk art and international primitivism with Art Nouveau, thus paving the way for the \"Neo-Brâncovenesc\" school of decorators and architects. The interest in decorative works was a special focus of his visits to England and France—the South Kensington Museum impressed him greatly, as did the workshops of Eugène Grasset and Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran.\n\nDescribed by Lucian Nastasă as a case of social climbing, Tzigara's marriage to Maria (1900) brought him into the high circles of aristocracy: Maria, born into the Cantacuzino family (daughter of Alexandru Cantacuzino, former Foreign Affairs Minister), was also the widow of Grigore Sturdza, and as such inherited part of the Sturdza family fortune. Through her mother Coralia, Maria Tzigara-Cantacuzino was additionally related to boyar lines of Moldavia, the Boldurs and the Costakis, as well as to Zulnia, mother of historian Nicolae Iorga. This marriage was reportedly arranged by the Kremnitzes, the couple having as their best men-godfathers two influential political figures: Lupu Kostaki, Constantin C. Arion.\n\nDuring the \"fin de siècle\" period, Tzigara-Samurcașș also began a cooperation with \"Junimea\", the literary society representing Romanian traditional conservatism, and sympathized with the \"Junimist\" nucleus of the Conservative Party. The art historian was one of the young scholars fascinated with the personality of Titu Maiorescu, the cultural critic and main \"Junimea\" leader, and joined a new \"Junimist\" critical elite which also comprised Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Pompiliu Eliade, Mihail Dragomirescu, P. P. Negulescu etc. His work was featured, along with texts by other 50 \"Junimists\", in the Editura Socec volume \"Lui Titu Maiorescu omagiu, XV februarie MCM\" (\"To Titu Maiorescu as Homage, February 15, 1900\"). Maiorescu's diaries display his interest in Tzigara's private life, and claim that the scholar was by then lover of the widowed and much older Mite Kremnitz, with whom Maiorescu himself had had an affair.\n\nTzigara attended, in 1901, a major event in \"Junimist\" society: the wedding between Nicolae Iorga and Ecaterina, daughter of scholar Ioan Bogdan, where Tzigara unofficially represented the royal court. Tzigara was the couple's godfather at an Orthodox marriage service held outside the Kingdom of Romania, in Belgerei (Șcheii Brașovului), Transylvania. For a while, Iorga and Bogdan were both interested in obtaining Tzigara a better employment at the University of Bucharest, but their efforts were made useless by the \"Junimea\" adversary in government, the National Liberal Party.\n\nBefore 1903, Tzigara became a literary and art columnist at \"Epoca\" newspaper, headed at the time by Maiorescu. During the period, \"Junimea\" popularized its causes through \"Epoca\", rather than through their main venue \"Convorbiri Literare\", and, according to Maiorescu's own pronouncement, Tzigara's work was a main asset. Around 1907, Tzigara's work was also regularly featured in \"Convorbiri Literare\", edited by Maiorescu's pupil Simion Mehedinți. At the time, Transylvania's \"Răvașul\" journal commented that Tzigara's art chronicle and Aurel Popovici's political column were especially \"rich\" in information, and mentioned that Tzigara and Teohari Antonescu were debating, through the journal, about the characteristics of fortified houses (\"cule\") from Oltenia region. As literary historian Tudor Vianu notes, Tzigara-Samurcaș and architect Aurel Zagoritz centered their contributions here on the scientific study of Romanian folk art, but their presence nevertheless coincided with \"Convorbiri Literare\"s decline in readership. Tzigara also published his articles in Iorga's traditionalist magazine \"Sămănătorul\", where he discussed the art exhibits of the \"Tinerimea Artistică\" society.\n\nAround 1901, inspired by the Paris World Fair, Tzigara and other Romanian ethnographers first took into consideration the establishment of a permanent ethnographic collection. Like other Romanian intellectuals, Tzigara preserved his special interest in handicrafts, which, art conservator Isabelle Longuet argues, were \"elevated to the status of 'national art' \" in the belief that the peasantry represented \"an authentic 'Romanianness' \". In similar terms, ethologist Ioana Popescu notes: \"[Tzigara's] collections were to become the argument and the source of inspiration for the national ideology and creation.\" His project came after a similar attempt on the part of art collector Nicolae Minovici, founder of the private folk art museum \"Casa Minovici\", and an even earlier textile art archive, endorsed by Maiorescu (1875).\n\n1906 marked the start of Tzigara's chief work as an ethnographer. That year, he founded the \"Museum of Ethnography and National Art\", now Museum of the Romanian Peasant (and which he intended to name \"Museum of the Romanian People\"), serving as its Director for the next forty years. This project received support from Education Minister Haret and, on the other side of politics, from Haret's predecessor Maiorescu. The institution was later known as \"Museum of Ethnography and National Art\" or \"Carol I Museum of Ethnography and National Art\". Its original quarters were the abandoned National Mint building on Kiseleff Road, but plans were being made for a new, more adequate museum palace.\n\nAs manager, Tzigara-Samurcaș ordered the collection into two distinct sections, dedicated respectively to ethnography-proper and sacred art (the latter chapter also took over the religious objects kept at the National Museum of Antiquities). An additional exhibit was to include the \"Tropaeum Traiani\" metopes, attesting the Roman Empire's rule over Dobruja. Tzigara's subsequent work as a collector and folk art historian received much appreciation. A 1914 article in \"Luceafărul\" journal stated: \"[He] reorganized [the museum] and turned into a true national institution. The Museum's rich collections are owed to Mr. Tzigara-Samurcaș's industriousness.\" In 2010, folk art reviewer Mihai Plămădeală wrote that Tzigara's activity \"impacted on everything that this Museum ever meant in the history of Romanian culture.\"\n\nTzigara's fieldwork also focused specifically on increasing the museum's ethnographic collection. Particularly active in Oltenia, he was, as Ioana Popescu notes, \"more attracted by decorated, colorful objects, used at celebration time.\" During one such trip to Gorj County, he bought, disassembled and transported back to Bucharest the \"Antonie Mogoș House\", considered a masterpiece of Romanian woodcarving and the museum's centerpiece. It is the first-ever such relocation in the history of Romanian museums. His photographic collection was expanded by an entire series on Oltenian carpets, which helps in their specific taxonomy.\n\nThe developments raised interest among the ethnic Romanian community of Transylvania, whose cultural body, the ASTRA Society, was in the process of creating its own permanent exhibit of folk architecture, later ASTRA National Museum Complex. ASTRA activist Octavian Tăslăuanu reported in 1909: \"[Tzigara's] national art museum, although [...] important sums were spent on it, is at the early stage of its beginnings. Only two years ago did more systematic work begin for its endowment and presently, its national significance recognized, the state granted it a yearly sum of 14,000 lei [...]. And maybe in a few years those who are running it, so diligently, will manage to turn it into an institution of great importance for our national art.\" The next year, Tzigara himself wrote, in \"Convorbiri Literare\", that Tăslăuanu's work with ASTRA permanent exhibits was far more advanced than his when it came to storage and display, but noted that the ASTRA collections were not yet rich enough to validate the \"museum\" name.\n\nDuring those years, Tzigara was also an inspector and evaluator of works collected from Secu Monastery and the Diocese of Buzău, becoming both a Fellow of the Romanian Royal Society of Geography and the Architects' Society. Tzigara also served as representative of the Romanian curators in European colloquiums: the Public Art Congress of Liège, Belgium (1905) and the Braunschweig Congress on Art Conservation (1906), where he presented a report on the efforts to preserve Romanian monuments. Also in 1906, Tzigara-Samurcaș attended the 8th International Congress of Art History. Once familiarized with the artistic fashions of the day, Tzigara reported to the National Liberal Education Minister Spiru Haret about the need to reform the educational system in such manner as to provide peasant children with an artistic education, citing reasons moral and economical.\n\nAround 1908, Tzigara was also involved in the process of cataloging and preserving the body of works left by Romanian painter Theodor Aman. The Aman Museum appointed him director, and, under his leadership, opened its doors to the public for the very first time. Tzigara was also involved in controversies marking the celebration of Carol I's 40th year on the throne, when he spoke out against politician Ioan Lahovary, accused of mismanaging the Carol Park festivities.\n\nThe creation of a separate University of Bucharest Art History Department for Tzigara was a project which split the academic and political world. At the core of such disputes was Nicolae Iorga, from the History Department, who argued that his own courses also covered art, and who consequently became Tzigara's main adversary. The proposal of expanding University was also defeated in Parliament by Lahovary, the Senate president, who probably still resented for his 1906 comments. The debates prolonged themselves over the following years. In 1909, Tzigara-Samurcaș, Grigore Tocilescu and George Murnu competed with each other for the Archeology Chair, and this created a dispute over whether art historians could not lecture in archeology (Murnu eventually won the contest, despite being exposed for plagiarism by Tzigara, in articles for the magazine \"Noua Revistă Română\"). The same year, he was in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, where he visited the Skansen, Bygdøy and Lyngby open-air museums, but suggested that a similar project would be redundant at home, arguing that peasant society in Romania was only too visible around Bucharest. He was much more impressed with the Nordic Museum, which reportedly became the template for his Bucharest museum.\n\nIn 1911 (or 1912), Tzigara eventually became a Substitute Professor of Art History at the University of Bucharest, attending the Great Art Exhibit of Berlin and, in Italy, the \"Esposizione internazionale d'arte\". He lectured on folk art at the \"Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin\" and in Austria-Hungary, at the Vienna \"Museum für angewandte Kunst\". Overall, his mission was to introduce Romanian art to an international audience, as noted by \"Luceafărul\": \"he arranged the Romanian pavilions, making known for the first time in history the artistic creations of our people. In all exhibits he registered successes\". A prestigious visitor of the National Museum was Raymund Netzhammer, the Catholic Archbishop of Bucharest, who was introduced there by Tzigara, with whom he remained good friends. Netzhammer was impressed with its ethnographic collection: \"Nowhere can one acquire a better eye for Romanian folk art than in this establishment.\"\n\nIn support of his activities, Tzigara published a succession of art books. In 1906, \"Arta publică\" (\"Public Art\") appeared in Bucharest, while the German-language study \"Denkmalpflege in Rumänien\" (\"Historical Preservation in Romania\") saw print in Karlsruhe. Later, Tzigara contributed biographical and critical entries in the 1907 edition of \"Allgemeines Lexicon der bildenden Künstler\". \"Catalogul Muzeului Aman\" (\"The Aman Museum Catalog\") of 1908 was followed the same year by the essay \"Ce se înțelege prin arheologia de azi\" (\"The Present-day Meaning of Archeology\") and the monograph \"Biserica din Filipeștii de Pădure\" (\"The Church of Filipeștii de Pădure\", co-authored with Nicolae Ghica-Budești and Gheorghe Balș). In 1909, he authored the album-study \"Arta în România\" (\"Art in Romania\"), comprising his collected \"Convorbiri\" essays and edited by Minerva, together with another monograph, \"Muzeul neamului românesc\" (\"The Museum of the Romanian People\").\n\nThe next year, he followed up with \"Discuțiuni în jurul arheologiei\" (\"Debates on Archeology\") and \"Rumänische Volkskunst\" (\"Romanian Folk Art\"); in 1911, with \"Casa românească de la Roma\" (\"The Romanian House of Rome\"); in 1912, with \"Sonderaustellung Rumäniens\" (\"Romania's Special Exhibit\"), \"Istoria artei și însemnătatea ei\" (Art History and Its Significance\"), \"Muzeul național din București\" (\"The National Museum Bucharest\"). Between 1909 and 1912, he also redacted Carol I's 17 volumes of memoirs, working from scattered notebooks. As an art critic for \"Epoca\" and \"Convorbiri\", Tzigara became one of those who opposed the new primitivist tendencies of the \"Tinerimea Artistică\" group: in 1910, he chided the modern sculptor Constantin Brâncuși for his break with tradition, and even suggested that Brâncuși's works be hidden away from the public eye. Such reactions made Brâncuși decide to leave Romania and begin his international career.\n\nWhile in Rome, Tzigara was reputedly offered membership in the Freemasonry's Grand Orient de France, to whom many of Romanian colleagues belonged (\"see Freemasonry in Romania\"). The offer, Tzigara later claimed, was made by sculptor Ettore Ferrari, and included various perks and a promise that he would soon become a Masonic Grand Master. Although widely rumored to have taken up the offer, Nastasă writes, Tzigara was probably never a Freemason. Also in 1911, he was briefly President of a newly created professional association, the Romanian Writers' Society.\n\nTzigara's honors for 1912 included the Romanian Kingdom's \"Bene Merenti\" medal for services to culture. During much of that year, after some campaigning to obtain state funds, the art historian considered proposals for the Ethnography Museum's headquarters, also housed on Kiseleff. He and his colleagues looked into international proposals, from Heino Schmieden, Louis Blanc and others, but eventually settled for a design proposed to them by the Romanian native Ghica-Budești. The Neo-Brâncovenesc features of the building, researchers note, where themselves an attempt to highlight the return to a peasant model. This formed part of a greater urban planning effort undertaken, with Carol I's approval and the involvement of Neo-Brâncovenesc architects, throughout northern and central Bucharest, with the erecting of many new public buildings: the Palace of Justice, the CEC Palace, the Geology Museum etc. (\"see History of Bucharest\"). Despite the approval, and the ceremonial placement of a foundation stone, construction was remarkably slow or under-financed, and Tzigara, who came to resent Ghica-Budești, did not live to see its completion.\n\nTzigara's scientific work for 1913, when he also attended the \"Tentoonstelling De Vrouw\" event in Amsterdam, includes a monograph on the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral Church. That year, as Romania joined the Second Balkan War coalition against the Kingdom of Bulgaria, and although spared from conscription, Tzigara volunteered for service in the Romanian Land Forces. He motivated this initiative by stating that his skill was needed for documenting the war and creating its archive. Tzigara served in the 4th Army Corps, under Crown Prince Ferdinand (Carol I's designated successor).\n\nIn 1914, Tzigara was appointed Director of the Carol I Foundation. At around the same time, he began a new series of conferences in Austria-Hungary, lecturing on art for the benefit of Romanians in Transylvania and Banat regions. He was also interested in the collection of Transylvanian Romanian artifacts, added to the Bucharest Museum collection. Initially, he was in Lugosch (Lugoj), informing locals about Romanian folk art. One other such event took place in Hermannstadt (Sibiu), where he was invited by ASTRA to speak about the 50 years of development in Romanian art.\n\nThis conference contained Tzigara' artistic credo: he believed that art was an objective reflection of social and cultural development, identifying the Westernization process, the proclamation of the 1881 Kingdom and later events with a profound transformation of Romania. However, Tzigara suggested, these efforts did not yet find a suitable answer in the artistic field, that is the birth of a specifically Romanian art phenomenon and the proper conservation of artistic legacies: he deplored the destruction of old Bucharest townhouses and their replacement with Westernized villas; he commended the restoration of Horezu Monastery in its original \"Brâncovenesc\" style, but criticized those who introduced Gothic revival elements at Tismana, Bistrița or Arnota; lastly, he expressed support for the \"healthy\" Neo-Brâncovenesc style of Ion Mincu and criticized muralist Octavian Smigelschi for his work on the Sibiu Cathedral. The conference included ample praise of Carol I as a patron of conservation, and nods in the direction of Carol's French architect, André Lecomte du Nouÿ.\n\nThe second part of Tzigara's Hermannstadt conference focused on the Romanian school of oil painting. He paid homage to its traditionalist founder, Nicolae Grigorescu, and to Aman, before summarizing the later contributions of Ștefan Luchian, Arthur Verona and Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The third part highlighted his own research of Transylvanian folk art, and spoke about Romania's Queen Elisabeth as a collector of folk art from Sibiu area.\n\nTzigara preserved these principles during the rest of his professional life, and the themes of his conferencing resurface in his old age memoirs. These too shed light on Carol I's architectural role, and express approval for Lecomte de Nouÿ's since-criticized methods of conservation (including the decision to the tear down and rebuild Curtea de Argeș Cathedral). They also return to Smigelschi's murals, criticizing his depiction of saints in national Romanian dress as highly inappropriate.\n\nTzigara's international and scholarly activities suffered from the outbreak of World War I in summer 1914, even though Romania remained neutral until mid-1916. His purported father, Carol I, died in September 1914. According to his Archbishop Netzhammer, Tzigara was deeply affected by the event: \"Like a child, he loosened his suffering, deploring in front of me this terrible and unexpected loss\". By then, however, Tzigara had befriended Ferdinand I, the new king, and was an admirer of Ferdinand's wife, Marie of Edinburgh. He found that Ferdinand was \"gentle\", \"jocular\" and usually self-effacing, \"in all things the opposite of his uncle\" Carol I. In Queen Marie, the art historian recognized a political woman, more active in public affairs than Carol's Elisabeth. Tzigara also shared Marie's artistic taste, including her passion for the work of Romanian Symbolist sculptors Oscar Späthe and Friedrich Storck (whom, in 1903, he had called them \"innovators of Romanian sculpture\").\n\nUnlike Ferdinand and his Francophile circle, who desired a Romanian alliance with the Entente for the sake of union with Transylvania, Tzigara was opposed to any move against Germany. He represented the Germanophile lobby within the University of Bucharest, at the same junior level as another substitute professor, Constantin Litzica. For a while, he was also co-opted on the leadership committee of the Romanian Writers' Society, but lost his seat there in 1915 (probably owing to his presence among the minority of Germanophile writers).\n\nThe subsequent campaign ended abruptly in southern Romania's invasion by the Central Powers (Germans and their allies). In November 1916, shortly before King Ferdinand and the pro-Entente government retreated to Iași, they appointed Tzigara-Samurcaș a custodian of the Crown and Royal Domains, tasked with preventing acts of vandalism on the occupiers' part. He stayed behind in Bucharest and met with August von Mackensen, head of the occupation forces. As a result of this encounter, the Germans asked Tzigara to discuss an offer of collaboration with the senior Conservative Party Germanophiles: Maiorescu, Alexandru Marghiloman, Petre P. Carp. All three refused to openly associate with Mackensen's military rule, but a puppet civilian administration was set up under Carp's disciple Lupu Kostaki. Carp's reply to Tzigara's proposition is recorded as: \"Such a thing is of no interest to me; it is nonsense, and at this moment counts as weakness.\" Maiorescu's deteriorating relationship with Carp was also a factor: Carp flatly refused to attend any meeting where Maiorescu was present, and alienated the other two by stating that King Ferdinand should be deposed. Maiorescu himself explained that it was a question of principle: \"Tzigara has been proposing this to me, but I did not wish to. If [Mackensen] orders me to go, let him send in armed soldiers to take me.\"\n\nOn , the art historian took over as Police chief in occupied Bucharest. This proved to be a highly controversial decision, the consequences of which would harm Tzigara's interwar career. While his political adversaries later alleged that Tzigara had been granted the appointment through German pressures, he himself claimed that Carp and Kostaki had asked him to become involved. Also according to Tzigara, his appointment resolved a practical issue, since his legitimate predecessor, General Alexandru Mustață, could not speak any German. Kostaki's administration also included Litzica, who was puppet Minister of Education in spring 1917. Tzigara personally intervened in the selection of other bureaucrats. In February 1917, he brought writer I. A. Bassarabescu into his Police apparatus, obtaining his release from German internment and appointing him head of division. Reportedly, he did the same for philosopher Mircea Florian, who became his Carol I Foundation subordinate.\n\nAs recorded by Archbishop Netzhammer, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș was open and cooperative in his relationship with the new authorities and the German community. In September 1917, the Romanian scholar greeted Wilhelm II, German Emperor, who was visiting the occupied half of Romania. Reportedly the only Romanian in attendance, he followed Wilhelm to the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral, where they both paid their respects to Carol I's tomb. Tzigara was also a personal guest at the imperial table, and Wilhelm had several long conversations with him in private. At the end of their encounter, Tzigara received from the emperor's hand a diamond-and-ruby tie pin.\n\nTzigara-Samurcaș nonetheless had a complex relationship with his German supervisors. He refused to cooperate with them on several occasions, objecting to the creation of a German Institute within the University, and being strongly opposed to the Central Powers' interventions on Bucharest Royal Palace grounds. In late 1916 and early 1917, he was in intense correspondence with Ioan Bianu, a fellow scholar and disillusioned Germanophile, who complained about the German Army pressures on the Romanian Academy and asked Tzigara to intervene on his colleagues' behalf. On one occasion, as a result of Bianu's plea, Tzigara sent in his policemen to prevent German soldiers from stealing the Academy's firewood reserves. Boia argues that the main objective of Tzigara's term, \"the security of people and property\", was competently met. The same is noted by Ornea, who cautions: \"the nude fact of his, all things considered, willing collaboration with the German occupier, is still a litigious issue\". The Police chief was also critical of his more docile colleagues: as recorded in Marghiloman's diary, Tzigara was present at the October 1917 Athénée Palace gala organized by Mackensen (October 1917), but was irritated to find himself in the company of junior bureaucrats who were well liked by the Germans. He referred to this category, which included poet Luca Caragiale, as the \"nippers\". In December of the same year, Caragiale enraged Tzigara by going over his head: the poet used German connections to obtain Police guards at an official function, after Tzigara had refused to grant his request.\n\nIn January 1918, while the Iași authorities were considering a way out of the war, Tzigara-Samurcaș handed in his resignation to the Germans. A separate peace with the Central Powers followed: in March–April, the new national unity government of Marghiloman reassigned him to the position of Police chief. This posting, made legitimate by King Ferdinand's royal decree, Tzigara kept until November 14, 1918—that is, three days after the Armistice with Germany reshuffled Romania's commitments. During the interval, with only 220 forces under his command, he was powerless to deal with the growing protest movement of Romanian Railways workers.\n\nRomania's sudden return to Francophilia had also brought Marghiloman's downfall, described by Tzigara as an anti-Conservative \"coup d'état\". Zigu Ornea finds this expression of resentment especially problematic, since, he argued, it meant that Tzigara placed Germanopilia above the establishment of Greater Romania: \"[he] understood next to nothing from the reality of the wartime political phenomenon.\"\n\nThe end of the war signified a slump in Tzigara's career. His imperial tie pin, Boia notes, became a \"corpus delicti\" for those accusing Tzigara of treason. Such accusations were given ample exposure in Rector Ion Atanasiu's essay \"Rătăciri naționale\" (\"National Ravings\", 1919), answered to in detail by Tzigara's own \"\", \"Mărturisiri silite\" (\"Forced Confessions\", 1920), and later by his posthumously published \"Memorii\" (\"Memoirs\"). Athanasiu was the first who suggested holding Tzigara accountable for his wartime behavior, and, in his University report, alluded to the possibility of sacking both him and the Germanophile biologist Victor Babeș. Ornea finds that, in those years, Athanasiu and Tzigara's traditional foe Nicolae Iorga were waging \"a veritable war against Tzigara-Samurcaș\".\n\nTzigara was omitted from an early purge of University Germanophiles, but, on November 29, 1919, was subjected to questioning by Rector Atanasiu, Iorga and the Board of Professors. As he later recalled, his defense tactic was to recall that, back in 1906, Iorga himself was seen as a radical Francophobe (\"see Sămănătorul\"). On Iorga and Atanasiu's proposal, but against the advice of Ion Cantacuzino and Dimitrie Onciul, the Board took a vote to ban Tzigara-Samurcaș; the result was indecisive, and Tzigara preserved his chair. Atanasiu however took the vote as evidence that Tzigara had lost his support, and requested a decision from higher authorities. As Boia notes, this was a political miscalculation: the anti-Germanophile lobby had been defeated in Parliament by Prime Minister Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, who could not be expected to grant Atanasiu a victory. In the end, Education Minister and zoologist Ioan Borcea sent a letter to Atanasiu, asking him to desist frustrating Tzigara \"in his attributions without legal decision\", adding: \"Especially at this moment in time, we find it necessary that peace and harmony be restored for University to function properly.\" These and other moral defeats prompted Atanasiu to present his resignation, which came with his final protest that Minister Borcea had snubbed University during the \"Tzigara-Samurcaș affair\". In later years, Tzigara took his main accusers, Iorga and journalist Stelian Popescu, to court, in what became two celebrity trials.\n\nAs noted by literary critic Dumitru Hîncu, the art historian's wartime conduct was never censured by the interwar governments. He was again received into Queen Marie's circle, who allegedly told him: \"Iorga is jealous that he sees you coming over to visit with us.\" Tzigara was still an art columnist for \"Convorbiri Literare\", and, in 1921, became its new editor in chief. According to ASTRA's newspaper, \"Transilvania\", Tzigara rescued \"Convorbiri\" from bankruptcy, but only catered to a niche audience. He was thus unable to steer the magazine back into the cultural mainstream, its previous dominance replicated by the left-wing \"Viața Românească\".\n\nIn 1923, he was the Inspector General of Museums, under the National Liberals' Ion I. C. Brătianu cabinet, in which capacity he revisited the ASTRA Museum and awarded it a 50,000 lei grant from the state. The period also witnessed his first private visits to the Transylvanian spa town, Sovata. His main home in Bucharest was a large villa on Kogălniceanu Street, where he was living with his family.\n\nDespite his confirmation at the university, Tzigara-Samurcaș found it impossible to achieve tenure, and was also ousted from the Fine Arts School over his Germanophilia. With the diplomatic recognition of Greater Romania came new opportunity, and, in 1926, Tzigara left for Bukovina, taking over the art history department at Cernăuți University. Also that year, a mortally ill King Ferdinand made him a Grand Officer of the Order of the Star of Romania. Again touring Germany with a series of conferences (1926), Tzigara also spoke at Radio Berlin, making his debut in radio programming. Reportedly, his request of creating a special Romanian section on Berlin's Museum Island was granted by the Weimar Republic in early 1927.\n\nOn November 1, 1928, Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș provided the first-ever Radio Romania broadcast in history, with an art lecture specifically written for this purpose. This, Tzigara recalled, was a \"pro bono\" activity to please Radio Romania's president Constantin Angelescu, but made the speaker himself very nervous: Tzigara thought his own text bland and his voice ill-adapted for the medium, but took pains to improve them in later broadcasts. In 1929, Tzigara was a first judge at the original Miss Romania beauty contest, in a panel which also included Vaida-Voevod, writers Liviu Rebreanu and Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, woman activist Alexandrina Cantacuzino and other public figures.\n\nRomanian cabinets appointed him a national representative at the Universal Exposition in Barcelona, Spain, and organizer of the folk art exhibit at the International Peace Bureau's Balkan Conference in Athens, Greece. He also attended the 13th International Congress of Art History in Stockholm, Sweden, and organized the Romanian pavilion at an Art Conference in Helsinki, Finland. His efforts won international recognition, and the French state, through Bucharest Ambassador Gabiel Puaux, presented Tzigara with a gift of Sèvres porcelain. He was also awarded the Order of St. Sava by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nTzigara's position was threatened in 1930, when Ferdinand's deposed son Carol II retook his throne. It was alleged that Iorga, a supporter of the new king, asked for Tzigara to be removed from the royal Foundation, but that Carol had stated not being willing to sack \"my own uncle.\" Iorga was however in a position to limit his rival's access to academia when, in 1931, he became Carol II's Prime Minister. His legislative proposal, limiting the number of academic positions an individual could hold, was probably aimed specifically at Tzigara and other personal enemies (as Lucian Nastasă writes, Iorga was himself collecting some five monthly salaries from his work with the state).\n\nAt around the same time, Tzigara became a contributor to the official literary and scientific magazine, \"Revista Fundațiilor Regale\", and again toured the country with lectures on folk art. With Simion Mehedinți and the ASTRA Society, he returned to the field of public activism with controversial lectures on the biology of the Romanian nation, which sometimes included overt advocacy of eugenics. His racialist theory had it that the geometric abstraction of peasant art, purported to have been strongly resistant to foreign influence, placed Romanians in the \"Alpine race\" cluster—an idea rejected in its day by anthropologist Henric Sanielevici, who contrarily believed that Romanians were \"Mediterranean\". In 1933, he was briefly affiliated with the Romanian National Socialist Party and its \"Romanian–German Cultural Institute\".\n\nMoving away from Germanophilia, Tzigara saluted the Brussels World Fair of 1935 by highlighting the special connection between Romania, on one hand, and, on the other France, Belgium and the Francophone countries. He spoke on Radio France and the INR (he found the Francophone services to be more relaxing, but less organized, than their German counterpart). In the 1920s and '30s, Tzigara was host to several foreign researchers. Columbia University professor Charles Upson Clark called his institution \"splendid\", finding it partly responsible for a \"distinct revival\" in peasant crafts. He described the museum as \"a revelation of the artistic endowment of the Roumanian peasant.\" French archivist François de Vaux de Foletier visited his museum in 1934, later writing, in \"Monde et Voyages\" magazine, that it featured \"very interesting galleries of Romanian ethnography\".\n\nBeginning 1933, Tzigara was several times interviewed by Eugen Wolbe, the German biographer of Romanian kings, who had been sent to him by Carol II. Tzigara also reviewed Wolbe's texts, including his work on Queen Elisabeth (a \"weak\" study, in Tzigara's opinion), and described the visiting writer as an unreliable amateur: \"that pensioned ex-\"Gymnasiallehrer\" still had the audacity to select himself such august subjects, with the pretext of 'gaining many new friends for the beautiful country' of Romania, of which yet he himself knew so little!\" Tzigara was upset to receive a copy of Wolbe's 1937 work on Ferdinand, which, he claimed, entirely ignored specific criticism; he also approved of Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu's decision to ban the volume in its Romanian edition (the censoring left Wolbe indifferent, a fact noted in one of his letters to Tzigara). Tzigara's rival Iorga, probably incited by this controversy and by his own work with Wolbe, gave the book a positive review in his journal \"Neamul Românesc\", calling the government measure \"regrettable\", and receiving further criticism from Tzigara, through \"Convorbiri\".\n\nThe Carol I Museum increased in size throughout the interwar, organized several exhibits, and, in 1931, inaugurated its Ethnographic Section at the new Kiseleff location. In parallel, Tzigara popularized Romanian handicrafts abroad with his new French-language tract, \"Tapis Roumains\" (\"Romanian Carpets\"). Other contributions, published by \"Convorbiri Literare\" in 1934, include an introduction to Alexandru Odobescu's posthumous texts, \"Ineditele lui Odobescu\" (\"Odobescu's Unpublished Texts\") and an edition of Odobescu' 1895 suicide note. Another work, grouping his articles in defense of the Museum's construction, was published in 1936 as \"Muzeografie românească\" (\"Romanian Museography\"). Tzigara and cultural historian Nicolae N. Condeescu also left a monograph on the Peleș Castle, Carol I's residence in Sinaia.\n\nAs editor of \"Convorbiri Literare\", Tzigara also entered a polemic with a younger Maiorescu disciple, the critic and novelist Eugen Lovinescu. At the root of this debate stood Lovinescu's book on Mite Kremnitz and her affair with national poet (and \"Junimist\" herald) Mihai Eminescu. Joining in with other conservatives who accused Lovinescu of being a \"pornographer\", Tzigara claimed to defend Eminescu's image from the book's impiety. Lovinescu offered his replies in the daily \"Adevărul\", accusing Tzigara of \"literary incompetence\", and deploring the decline of \"Convorbiri\" beyond the threshold of professionalism: \"if, under previous directions, the magazine steered away from its stated mission [...], the deviance was at least made in an honorable direction, that is to say in the direction of history writing; the scientific seriousness of its two former directors had made it possible for \"Convorbiri\" to have valid contributions in areas other than literature.\" In reaction to claims of irreverence, he derided his adversary's artistic expertise as being about \"Easter eggs\", and defended his narrative as a sample of respect for Eminescu's life and legacy.\n\nTzigara met significant opposition in his bid for Romanian Academy membership, primarily from Academy member Iorga. He was eventually elected a corresponding member in 1938, when Iorga's influence was being challenged by his younger peers. The same year, he was pensioned from his positions at Cernăuți University and the Foundation. In 1939, he dedicated himself to completing his homage to the memory of Carol I, on his 100th birthday: \"Din viața regelui Carol I. Mărturii contemporane și documente inedite\" (\"From the Life of King Carol I. Contemporary Testimonials and Never-before Published Documents\"), called \"splendid\" by Lucian Nastasă. He resigned from his editorial office at \"Convorbiri\", which was taken over by writer and linguist I. E. Torouțiu. Tzigara announced this change with a final editorial piece, which read: \"Satisfied to have insured the magazine's future, we announce at this moment that we are placing our directorial office in the hands of a new generation, which is led by Professor I. E. Torouțiu, [...] who with his valuable and sizable published works, appreciating \"Junimea\"s role in the movement to renew the Romanian literary language, will know how to carry on the ever-lasting flame of \"Junimist\" ideas\".\n\nAt that point in life, Tzigara was also pleased with the state and popularity of museology in Greater Romania; in 1937, he had claimed: \"all the country is presently a museum\". His hostility to open-air museums was by then a thing of the past, since, it was argued, Greater Romania's peasant society seemed threatened by modern urbanization. In the late 1930s, this judgment prompted sociologist Dimitrie Gusti to create the National Village Museum, located a short distance away from Tzigara's own building site.\n\nA final moment of preeminence in Tzigara's career occurred during World War II. Initially, with war looming, Chief of the Romanian General Staff Florea Țenescu tasked Tzigara with drafting an \"Ex-ante International Convention Project for the Protection of Monuments and Works of Art\", which was never put into motion. In summer 1940, during a period when Carol II was trying to calm tensions between Romania and Nazi Germany, Tzigara, Ion Nistor, Grigore Antipa, Ion Sân-Giorgiu and other academics greeted a Nazi visitor, scholar Herbert Cysarz.\n\nAfter 1940, Romania ousted Carol II's National Renaissance Front government, replacing it with an openly fascist, pro-Axis regime, the National Legionary State. In parallel, Tzigara managed to gather political support for terminating Nicolae Ghica-Budești's contract and, in 1941, hired architect Gheorghe Ionescu to finalize the Museum's construction. Late in the same year, he was one of the Romanian scholars who welcomed German Romance studies expert Ernst Gamillscheg on his visit to Bucharest. In 1942, he was tasked by Romania's military dictator Ion Antonescu with creating a monumental National Heroes' Cemetery in Carol Park, but the building works were cut short by the reversal of fortunes on the Eastern Front. Also then, he returned to research with a book about the carpets and rugs of Oltenia, which notably stated his ethnic nationalist credo in art: \"By using the everlasting heritage of our beautiful folk art in different fields, we will be easily able to get rid of the foreign influences that pervaded Romanian households.\"\n\nShortly after the August 1944 Coup deposed Antonescu, the daily \"România Liberă\", which was at the time a Romanian Communist Party tribune, featured Tzigara's name on a list of \"national betrayal\", which also included Germanophile or fascist intellectuals. Two years later, the pro-communist cabinet of Petru Groza sidelined Tzigara-Samurcaș, appointing him honorary director of the museum, but effectively stripping him of his responsibilities. At that stage, plans were being examined for the disestablishment of the Peasant Art Section at the Museum, but Tzigara obtained support from Communist Party man Emil Bodnăraș and from Presidium Chief Constantin Ion Parhon. Tzigara attended the clandestine meetings of the Mihai Eminescu Association, an anti-communist group formed through the efforts of critic Pavel Chihaia, and which disappeared in 1948. His chief activity, from 1948 to 1952, was the writing of his memoirs.\n\nThe official establishment of Romania's communist regime was the start of several new problems for the aging scholar: many of his belongings were taken away during nationalization, others were sold in public auction, while he himself was taken to court by some of his former employees. In 1948, he was also stripped of his Academy membership. The following year, his pension was suspended, although, in 1950, he was elected to the International Committee of the History of Art. The National Museum was reopened in 1951 as a \"National Museum of Folk Art\", under new management.\n\nMarginalization aggravated Tzigara's illnesses, and he died on April 1, 1952. He was buried at Bellu Cemetery, with a small ceremony attended by family and a few of his intellectual friends: \"Convorbiri\" colleague Mehedinți, \"Junimist\" philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, physician Daniel Danielopolu and writer Gala Galaction. He had lost his public profile, and the international community was left uninformed of his death: in 1955, an invitation to the 18th Art History Congress was mistakenly addressed to him.\n\nTzigara's contribution as an art historian has received mixed evaluations. According to Lucian Nastasă, his 1911 course at the Bucharest University was the first professional approach to the subject, after the \"somewhat organized\" attempts on Odobescu's part. Writing in 1920, art historian Gheorghe Oprescu also suggested that, with Nicolae Iorga's reviews, Tzigara's \"intelligent articles\" were the only ones in the Romanian press to properly educate the public taste. Charles Upson Clark also rated \"Tzigara-Samurcash\" as one of Romania's \"best-known modern writers\" in the field of archeology or ancient art, with Alexandru Lapedatu, George Murnu and Abgar Baltazar. Contrarily, a later assessment made by ethnologist Romulus Vulcănescu rated both Tzigara, Iorga and Oprescu as authors of \"ethnological essayistics and cultural microhistory\", who lacked a global approach to folk art research. Dumitru Hîncu, writing in 2007, noted that, once \"a first-rate cultural figure\", Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș \"no longer says a great deal for your average present-day reader\".\n\nThe art historian's figure inspired literary critic George Călinescu in writing his novel \"Scrinul negru\", about the decline of Romanian aristocracy. A more unusual trace of his activity is preserved in \"Tzigara-Samurkasch\", the name of a fictional place in the writings of Bukovina native Gregor von Rezzori. A comment left by Tzigara in his Peleș Castle book has fueled cyberculture speculation and an urban legend about the existence of 20 lei coins from the 1860s, which are supposedly extremely valuable items.\n\nTzigara-Samurcaș's Museum building was only finished after his death, later in the 1950s. By the time of its completion, however, the building's purpose had changed, and, historian Andrei Pippidi writes, it \"passed through the most humiliating of its stages\". Its collections were moved to a new location, and, in 1978, merged into the Village Museum. The Kiseleff building was assigned to the \"Lenin-Stalin Museum\", which later became the Communist Party Museum. Shortly after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 toppled communism, the Salvation Front Minister of Culture Andrei Pleșu created, on National Museum grounds, a Museum of the Romanian Peasant, which he placed under the direction of painter Horia Bernea. It was officially inaugurated in 1993. Although sometimes described as Tzigara's successor, Bernea, helped by ethnologist Irina Nicolau, merged the scientific function into a conceptual art project, which is described by various commentators as a radical break with the interwar National Museum.\n\nAccording to Lucian Boia, Tzigara's work with the Germans in World War I continues to be perceived as a stain on his career, and was as such omitted from official histories which deal with the period. This, Boia notes, happened especially during the latter, nationalist, stage of Romanian communism, when World War I was presented as a moment of anti-German \"unanimity\". However, the period also brought the publication of Tzigara's collected \"Scrieri despre arta românească\" (\"Writings on Romanian Art\", 1987). The first installment of Tzigara-Samurcaș's memoirs was first published in 1999, ten years after the Revolution, by Grai și Suflet imprint. Later volumes saw print with Editura Meridiane. These works have raised interest for their historical and biographical content, but, Zigu Ornea contends, are largely without literary value. Ornea also criticized the two editors, Ioan and Florica Șerb, for only including some citations from Tzigara's contemporaries as notes, instead of a more complete critical apparatus. Editura Vitruviu also published another volume of Tzigara's memoirs, as \"Lupta vieții unui octogenar\" (\"An Octogenarian's Lifelong Combat\", 2007).\n\nA large part of his photographic plates ended up as a special fund of the Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism. In May 2010, they were inventoried and published, in print and DVD format, as \"Arhiva Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș\". A selection of these works was displayed in 2011, during a special Museum of the Romanian Peasant exhibit, sponsored by the Romanian Cultural Institute. The rest, preserved by the Fine Arts School, were donated to the Museum of the Romanian Peasant in 2000. A Tzigara-Samurcaș Foundation was created with the goal of preserving folklore and handicrafts. Its projects include the revival of Ocna Șugatag \"hore\" and the \"Ethnophone\" folk music events, sponsored by the European Union's \"Culture 2000\".\n\nTzigara's son, Sandu Tzigara-Samurcaș, was a poet, known for his 1943 volume \"Culesul de apoi\" (\"The Latter-day Reaping\"); his wife was poet Adrienne Prunkul. His Bucharest salon braved communist censorship and, in the 1950s, hosted poets such as Ion Barbu and Nichita Stănescu. Sandu had two sisters, of whom Ana Tzigara became, in 1935, the wife of folklorist Marcu Berza. Settled with her husband in Italy until her death in 1967, she established her reputation as a post-Impressionist painter and, after the 1989 Revolution, had her retrospective exhibition at the Museum of the Romanian Peasant. Maria, Tzigara's other daughter, was a violinist for the Romanian Film Orchestra, married into the Berindei family (and thus became related to historians Dan and Mihnea Berindei).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16193512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16193512", "title": "Bela Talbot", "text": "Bela Talbot\n\nBela Talbot is a fictional character on The CW Television Network's drama/horror television series \"Supernatural\", portrayed by Lauren Cohan. Appearing only in the third season, she uses knowledge of the supernatural world to her advantage rather than to help those in need. Self-centered and a thorn in the side of the series' protagonists, Bela makes her living by stealing occult objects and selling them to wealthy clients. Critical reaction to the character was mixed, with negative responses from fans ultimately leading to her departure at the end of the season.\n\nIn her first appearance, \"Bad Day at Black Rock\", Bela Talbot hires two crooks to steal a cursed rabbit's foot from a storage container owned by the deceased John Winchester, a hunter of supernatural creatures. Anyone who touches the foot is granted good luck, but will die within a week if the foot is lost. She intends to sell it and shows no concern for the fate of the thieves. John's sons, series protagonists Sam and Dean, retrieve the foot but are cursed by it. Bela interferes when they attempt to destroy it, and shoots Sam in the shoulder. Dean, however, tricks her into touching it. She gives the foot up for destruction to save herself, but manages to steal $46,000 in winning lottery tickets from Dean that he had purchased using the foot's granted luck.\n\nShe next appears in \"Red Sky at Morning\", an episode in which the Winchesters track down a ghost ship responsible for local deaths. Bela fools them into helping her again, with the three of them working together to steal the precious and magical Hand of Glory. The Winchesters plan to destroy the artifact to end the curse, but Bela steals it from them to sell to a client. However, Bela then witnesses the ghost ship, which only appears to those who have spilled the blood of a family member. Condemned to death, she turns to the Winchesters for help. Dean is prepared to leave her behind to die, but Sam comes up with a plan to save Bela's life. This time, Bela gives them $10,000 as a \"thank you\" before she leaves because she does not like being indebted to others.\n\nIn \"Fresh Blood\", hunter and recently escaped felon Gordon Walker tracks Bela down and threatens to kill her unless she reveals the location of the Winchesters, as he plans to kill Sam. Bela agrees to find out their location in exchange for his priceless mojo bag, and has an unsuspecting Dean disclose their whereabouts to her. After Dean threatens to kill her, she uses a Ouija board to placate him by obtaining information on Gordon's location so the Winchesters can neutralize the other hunter first.\n\nIn \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", Bela returns when the Winchesters contact her for help in saving fellow hunter and family friend Bobby Singer after he falls into a mystical coma. They need dream root to enter Bobby's dreams and find out what is keeping him asleep. She claims nothing from them in compensation, explaining she is helping them in order to repay a debt to Bobby. However, the Winchesters discover after Bobby awakens that she was lying, having helped them only in order to gain access to the Colt, a mystical gun capable of killing any being. Enraged at the theft, Dean and Sam attempt to track her down in \"Jus in Bello\", but instead are led into a trap she has set up; police arrest the Winchesters and place them in jail. Though the demonic overlord Lilith sends her forces, Sam and Dean eventually make their escape.\n\nIn \"Time Is On My Side\", Dean discovers Bela no longer has the Colt. He later gets her criminal record from England and learns her true name is Abbie. Almost ten years prior, when she was 14, she had her parents killed in exchange for her soul as part of a ten-year deal made with a Crossroads Demon; though Dean believes that she killed them to inherit their fortune and Bela supports this story, the audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to the deal to escape abuse from her father. Now desperate because her time is running out, Bela tries to kill the Winchesters, but they anticipate her and escape ahead of time. Dean then calls her a few minutes before her deal is up and she confesses to him she tried to get out of the deal with the Crossroads Demon by trading the Colt. Once she gave it up, however, the deal changed so she had to kill Sam as well. Though Dean refuses her pleas for help, she reveals to him the demon Lilith holds all the contracts brokered by Crossroads Demons, including his own. Bela's death—and her soul's resulting descent into Hell—is inevitable, but not shown.\n\nDescribed by her actress, Lauren Cohan, as \"a female Humphrey Bogart\", Bela is \"a little bit manipulative\" and she \"always wants to be in control\". According to series creator Eric Kripke, the writers conceptualized the character as \"someone [the Winchesters have] really never come across before\" because, though she moves throughout the supernatural world, Bela has no interest in the \"altruistic or obsessed or revenge-minded motives of hunting\". Writer and producer Sera Gamble summarized the writing team's characterization of Bela as a greedy \"mercenary that \"[sic]\" just [doesn't] give a shit about the cause\". Gamble believed that Bela \"finds it quite amusing\" that the Winchesters use their knowledge of the supernatural to help people. On this aspect, Gamble added, \"I always suspect when someone is that blasé that there's something underneath, and we're finally getting into that\".\n\nCohan viewed Bela as \"a young woman trying to make a living and find some kind of reason in her world\" who was \"a little damaged.\" The actress shared Gamble's opinion of Bela's behavior being a façade, and incorporated into her performance the idea of Bela hiding her true self, with Cohan feeling that her character created a persona to shield her from \"real strong connections\". This defensiveness prevented her from opening up to the Winchesters, with whom Cohan believed Bela \"would have loved to be able to have a normal relationship\". Contrary to Kripke and Gamble's assessment of Bela as amoral and uncaring, Cohan envisioned the character as having \"fits of conscience\" offscreen throughout the third season. In the actress's opinion, Bela \"would have loved to go around fighting evil with those boys.\"\n\n\"Supernatural\" producers originally intended for Bela to be a recurring character. Having already created a new female lead in the form of the demon Ruby, they chose to upgrade Bela to series regular after Dawn Ostroff—at the time, the CW President of Entertainment—requested a second female lead for the season, because they \"[loved Bela]\" and already planned for her to return in future episodes. To avoid the \"mistake\" they had made in the previous season in introducing Jo Harvelle as a love interest, the writers planned to introduce Bela as \"a character in [her] own right\" who would act as an antagonist \"with [her] own interests and [her] own motives\". They were, however, willing to add in a romantic involvement with Sam or Dean should they and the fans both want it. The writers also planned for Bela to be \"very separate and very different\" from Ruby, and for the characters to \"[serve] very different storylines.\"\n\nCohan auditioned for Ruby, but ultimately received the part of Bela. Upon learning of Cohan's British accent, a \"really psyched\" Kripke reworked the character to be British. The actress herself later pictured Bela that way, feeling she \"has some kind of cool shading and sneakiness, which fits the British accent\". At the time of Cohan's casting, however, she had been given little exposure to the character script-wise, and was unaware she would play a \"nasty person\". It was not until The CW up-fronts that Kripke gave her a \"good spiel\" about Bela because she would be interviewed. The actress later turned down an offer from him to provide more of the character's backstory, and instead opted to learn it as the episodes were filmed. In order to prepare for her role, Cohan received training in weaponry to be \"well equipped with swords and a lot of instruments—sharp instruments\", and in kickboxing alongside Ruby's actress Katie Cassidy. Cohan and Cassidy also decided to catch up on \"Supernatural\" before filming for the third season began, by watching the first two seasons together.\n\nDue to \"protective and occasionally nervous\" fans, Kripke meant for Bela to be introduced in \"small doses\". He wanted fans to know the show would always be just about Sam and Dean Winchester, and stated, \"[Ruby and Bela are] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor is it about the four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys.\" However, he felt the writers pushed it too far in the episode \"Red Sky at Morning\", stating his opinion that it \"was by far the least successful episode this year because it really kind of became the Bela show\". The writers also did not take the time to consider how to tie her into the Winchesters' storylines. As Kripke pointed out, \"It's a road show and we're in a different town every week, so if you're going to run into the same character over and over again, you better have a damn good reason...\" They were eventually \"crushed under the weight of the absurdity of it\" because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within the narrative. Another key problem stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for the brothers. The writers, \"so taken with a woman who could screw the boys over at every turn\", ended up making Bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance. Any chance for a \"funny effervescent episode where they all work together\" was lost after the character attempts to have the Winchesters killed on multiple occasions. They eventually decided to drop the character from the series, opting to \"send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way\" which would \"show a couple of cards [they have] been holding onto all season\" by revealing her backstory \"in a way that will surprise the audience and kind of tie her into the story.\"\n\nCritical response to the character has been mixed. \"BuddyTV\" staff columnist Don Williams deemed the addition of Bela a \"cheap ploy\" to attract teen male viewers, believing the character distracts viewers from the \"brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place\". As well, he felt her \"sexy cat burglar act, coupled with her flirtation with one of our heroes, is cliched and has been seen a thousand times before\", and he likened her to a combination of Catwoman and \"the equally annoying Electro-Gwen from \"Angel\"\". However, he later admitted Bela was \"a great comic foil\". Diana Steenbergen of IGN became \"increasingly frustrated\" with the \"unlikable and manipulative\" Bela throughout her appearances. She found the character's tragic backstory to be \"too little, too late\", but was surprised the writers were able to make her feel \"even a tiny bit sorry for [Bela]\" during her death scene. Writing that \"Bela had a hint of vulnerability that would have been intriguing had we glimpsed it more than 30 seconds before she died\", Steenbergen wished the character had been written differently—\"not either annoying or downright contemptible\"—and deemed her \"a wasted opportunity to give us an interesting female foil for the boys\". Karla Peterson of \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" expressed similar sentiments, voicing her belief in her review of the third season finale \"No Rest For The Wicked\" that Bela \"got gone just as [she was] getting interesting\". In the same review, Peterson deemed the character to be a \"decent traveling [companion]\". Although TV Guide's Tina Charles was annoyed that Bela continuously steals from the Winchesters and makes them \"look ridiculous\", she \"really liked\" the character. Overall, she felt Cohan \"did one hell of a job\".\n\nFrom the start, fans were very wary of bringing in female characters to the male-dominated show; they feared Bela was brought on to be \"arm candy or [a sidekick]\". To make matters worse, when coming up with the scenes for the auditions for Bela, executive producer Robert Singer spent an hour writing a lackluster script not intended to be used in the show. Mere hours after the script was given to the casting director, the show's fans had found them on casting websites and were \"obsessively going over these scenes\". According to Kripke, the fan reaction was the characters \"really look like they suck\". Bela's overly-antagonistic actions throughout the season did not calm the viewers' fears. \"[Bela screwed] over the boys so badly,\" Kripke explained, \"that she became unlikeable to the fans because she was irredeemable\". Kripke has confessed part of the decision to kill the character off was due to the negative reaction from the fans.\n"}

He also pursues a solo career under the moniker Atlas Sound.\n\nCox formed Deerhunter with drummer Moses Archuleta in 2001. The band has released 7 studio albums along with several singles and EPs. Atlas Sound is a name Cox has used since he was ten to refer to his own music, but his first full-length production under the name was \"Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See but Cannot Feel\" (2008). Cox's method of creating music is stream-of-consciousness, and he does not write lyrics in advance.\n\nHe made his film acting debut in 2013's \"Dallas Buyers Club\".\n\nCox founded Deerhunter with bassist Paul Harper and drummer Dan Walton (who named the band) in early 2001. The band expanded after Cox met a teenage transient, Moses Archuleta, who was sleeping on the floor of Cox's friends. Archuleta initially played Ace Tone Organ and electronics. The band's first shows were experimental and based on improvisation. Cox continued recording slightly more structured material and releasing it on CD-R and cassette using the name Atlas Sound. Paul Harper moved to Ohio and was replaced by Justin Bosworth. At this point Colin Mee also joined the band on guitar. Dan Walton left and Cox suggested Archuleta move to drums. The band's live shows and recordings became more song-oriented. They recorded their debut 7\" for Die Slaughterhaus. Josh Fauver joined the band in 2004 after Bosworth died in a freak skateboarding accident. This lineup recorded Deerhunter's debut LP on Atlanta label Stickfigure Records. Cox suggested Lockett Pundt, whom he befriended while attending Harrison High School in Kennesaw, Georgia, join the band on guitar so that he could concentrate on vocals and electronics. This lineup recorded their breakthrough record, 2007's \"Cryptograms\" until 2010's \"Halcyon Digest.\" Colin Mee left the band after failing to show up for a North American tour. Josh Fauver subsequently left the band and was replaced by Josh McKay. The band is now a four piece consisting of Cox on guitar and vocals, Pundt on guitar and occasional vocals, McKay on bass, and Archuleta on drums.\n\nAtlas Sound is the musical solo project of Cox, although he has used the name to represent his music since he was a child. He had access to a cassette player with two tape decks, which he used to layer guitar and drum sounds, and his own voice. In listening to some of these old tapes (of which Cox believes he has over five hundred in storage) he found \"Some of it is absolutely, terrifyingly bad, but sometimes I'm just like, 'Wow, that's cool.' That's actually how some Deerhunter songs happened. 'Spring Hall Convert' [from \"Cryptograms\"] was like that. That was a tape I made in ninth or tenth grade.\" Cox writes his music stream-of-consciousness, not writing lyrics in advance, and constructing songs by adding more parts until he feels \"it's getting crowded.\" The name of his project is derived from the brand of tape player he used, Atlas Sound.\n\nCox began Atlas Sound in the wake of his work with Deerhunter because \"I have ideas that I can't make work with a five piece rock band...There's kind of this palette of sounds that I use that I don't necessarily get to use with Deerhunter.\" Because the music Deerhunter makes is a collaborative effort, Cox does not want to assert himself as its principal songwriter. \"I might have an idea for a fragment of a song, but I want to leave it skeletal so the guys can fill it out. Whereas with Atlas Sound, everything is done in an hour.\" Cox created the music for his first record in the software Ableton Live, utilizing an array of computer-based instruments, as well as his own live recordings.\n\nTo date, there have been four major releases by Cox as Atlas Sound: \"Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See but Cannot Feel\" (2008), \"Logos\" (2009), a four-album set of previously unreleased songs called Bedroom Databank (2010), and finally \"Parallax\" in 2011. The lyrics of \"Let the Blind Lead\" are autobiographical in nature, reflecting life experiences of Cox. In discussing his second album, Cox characterized his first as being a \"bedroom laptop type thing\" and \"Very introverted.\" In contrast, \"Logos\" was written in several parts of the world, and is \"not about me. There are collaborations with other musicians. The lyrics are not autobiographical. The view is a lot more panoramic and less close-up. I became bored with introspection.\" An unfinished version of \"Logos\" was leaked onto the internet in August 2008, over a year before its release date. In response, Cox almost ceased production on the record, later saying \"I did not react well to the leak, in retrospect. It became the kind of internet-fueled drama that I was quickly learning to despise.\"\n\nIn late 2010, Cox published four volumes of demos on his blog, entitled \"Bedroom Databank\". These demos were taken down from Mediafire by Sony, but they later apologized to Cox, stating that the files \"were mistakenly removed\". Atlas Sound was chosen by Animal Collective to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that they curated in May 2011.\n\nCox has also recorded as part of other bands, such as the short lived \"Wet Dreams\", an otherwise all-girl garage / noise band in which he played drums. He also recorded several tracks on the Black Lips second album \"We Did Not Know the Forest Spirit Made the Flowers Grow\", playing drums on the song \"Notown Blues\" from that album.\n\nHe also is a part of the \"Avant-Garage\" band Ghetto Cross, with Cole Alexander from Black Lips, Frankie Broyles, and Asha Lakra.\n\nCox contributed to the Karen O-scored for the 2009 film \"Where the Wild Things Are\".\n\nIn November 2012, it was announced that Cox would portray Jared Leto's lover in the feature film, \"Dallas Buyers Club,\" co-starring Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Garner; this is Cox's film debut.\n\nFor the most part, Bradford favors vintage and modern Fender and Gibson guitars. Some of his guitars include:\n\n\nBradford Cox's Deerhunter Pedalboard as of 2016 Tours\n\n1966 Fender Jazzmaster into - (signal chain as follows)\nOut to Fender Hot Rod DeVille 4x10\n\nCox Also Uses an Exposed Spring Reverb Tank / Filter Unit for Noise and Effects\n\nVocal Effects Pedal Board\nBeyerdynamic M69 Mic Into:\n\nWhen playing live with Deerhunter, Bradford previously used Univox U-1226 Head into a vintage Marshall 4x10 Cabinet. He has also used a Marshall JCM800 half-stack, and occasionally a 70's Peavey Classic combo amplifier. He Currently uses a Fender Hot Rod DeVille 410.\n\nCox describes his mode of songwriting as 'automatic or stream-of-consciousness'. \"Usually I go into a sort of trance and I'll have five or six songs afterwards\", he said, speaking to Victoria Segal of \"Q\" in November 2010. \"What is interesting is seeing how the band adapts them and mutates them into the final product. Lots of accidents and primitive irrational things happen. It can be difficult trying to explain the process to a producer or engineer. They generally want to help you polish things and I tend to want to sabotage that\", he added.\n\nCox was born with the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome. As a teenager, he dropped out of high school (although later earned a GED) and his parents divorced, leaving him \"to live in my childhood home alone. I literally lived in this large suburban house by myself.\" Cox has called his changing music taste growing up reflective of his life and mental state. Around the age of ten, Cox's disorder began to affect his body in more visible ways; this is the point at which he \"first started looking awkward.\" With no friends, Cox became interested in how music could sound \"heartbreaking or nostalgic or melancholy\"; he identified with the title character of the film \"Edward Scissorhands\", and especially enjoyed the soundtrack, which was composed by Danny Elfman. Cox's tastes shifted to music that was more \"monotonous or hypnotic\", such as the Stereolab album \"Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements\". Around twenty years of age, his life situation brought about \"a period\", during which he became \"only interested in this certain sort of suburban psychedelic pastoral thing. It was escapism. I didn't want as much emotional manipulation. It's kind of the opposite of \"Edward Scissorhands.\"\"\n\nCox has described himself as gay, though he previously has stated that he leads a non-sexual/asexual lifestyle. However, in a 2011 interview with \"Rolling Stone,\" Cox said that he no longer identifies as asexual but rather as queer: \"For a long time I just said I was asexual, but now I just realized that… I'm still, I guess… I mean, I'm queer. I just sort of, don't really have a very big self-esteem, so asexuality is sort of like a comfort zone where you don't get rejected.\" Cox stated in an October 19, 2016 radio interview: \"There's so many types of sexuality, but one that I think is overlooked is to be asexual. I am absolutely asexual. I am a virgin at 34 years old.\"\n\nIn December 2014, Cox was hospitalized after being hit by a car.\n\nWith Deerhunter:\n\nAs Atlas Sound:\n\n"}

{"id": "186234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186234", "title": "David Bohm", "text": "David Bohm\n\nDavid Joseph Bohm (; December 20, 1917 – October 27, 1992) was an American scientist who has been described as one of the most significant theoretical physicists of the 20th century and who contributed unorthodox ideas to quantum theory, neuropsychology and the philosophy of mind.\n\nBohm advanced the view that quantum physics meant that the old Cartesian model of reality – that there are two kinds of substance, the mental and the physical, that somehow interact – was too limited. To complement it, he developed a mathematical and physical theory of \"implicate\" and \"explicate\" order. He also believed that the brain, at the cellular level, works according to the mathematics of some quantum effects, and postulated that thought is distributed and non-localised just as quantum entities are.\n\nBohm warned of the dangers of rampant reason and technology, advocating instead the need for genuine supportive dialogue, which he claimed could broaden and unify conflicting and troublesome divisions in the social world. In this, his epistemology mirrored his ontology. Due to his Communist affiliations, Bohm was the subject of a federal government investigation in 1949, prompting him to leave the United States. He pursued his scientific career in several countries, becoming first a Brazilian and then a British citizen. He abandoned Marxism in the wake of the Hungarian Uprising in 1956.\n\nBohm's main concern was with understanding the nature of reality in general and of consciousness in particular as a coherent whole, which according to Bohm is never static or complete but rather an unfolding process.\n\nBohm was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to a Hungarian Jewish immigrant father, Samuel Bohm, and a Lithuanian Jewish mother. He was raised mainly by his father, a furniture-store owner and assistant of the local rabbi. Despite being raised in a Jewish family, he became an agnostic in his teenage years. Bohm attended Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University), graduating in 1939, and then the California Institute of Technology, for one year. He then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, where he obtained his doctorate.\n\nBohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of Oppenheimer's other graduate students (Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz, Joseph Weinberg, and Max Friedman) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics. He was active in communist and communist-backed organizations, including the Young Communist League, the Campus Committee to Fight Conscription, and the Committee for Peace Mobilization. During his time at the Radiation Laboratory, Bohm was in a relationship with the future Betty Friedan and also helped to organize a local chapter of the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians, a small labor union affiliated to the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).\n\nDuring World War II, the Manhattan Project mobilized much of Berkeley's physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb. Though Oppenheimer had asked Bohm to work with him at Los Alamos (the top-secret laboratory established in 1942 to design the atom bomb), the project's director, Brigadier General Leslie Groves, would not approve Bohm's security clearance after seeing evidence of his politics and his close friendship with Weinberg, who had been suspected of espionage.\n\nDuring the war, Bohm remained at Berkeley, where he taught physics and conducted research in plasma, the synchrotron and the synchrocyclotron. He completed his Ph.D. in 1943 by an unusual circumstance. According to biographer F. David Peat (see reference below, p. 64), \"The scattering calculations (of collisions of protons and deuterons) that he had completed proved useful to the Manhattan Project and were immediately classified. Without security clearance, Bohm was denied access to his own work; not only would he be barred from defending his thesis, he was not even allowed to write his own thesis in the first place!\" To satisfy the University, Oppenheimer certified that Bohm had successfully completed the research. Bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the Calutrons at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was used for the electromagnetic enrichment of uranium for the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.\n\nAfter the war, Bohm became an assistant professor at Princeton University. He also worked closely with Albert Einstein at the nearby Institute for Advanced Study. In May 1949, the House Un-American Activities Committee called upon Bohm to testify because of his previous ties to suspected communists. Bohm invoked his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify, and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues.\n\nIn 1950, Bohm was arrested for refusing to answer the committee's questions. He was acquitted in May 1951, but Princeton had already suspended him. After his acquittal, Bohm's colleagues sought to have him reinstated at Princeton, but Princeton President Harold W. Dodds decided not to renew Bohm's contract. Although Einstein considered appointing him as his research assistant at the Institute, Oppenheimer (who had served as the Institute's president since 1947) \"opposed the idea and [...] advised his former student to leave the country.\" His request to go to the University of Manchester received Einstein's support but was unsuccessful. Bohm then left for Brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the University of São Paulo, at Jayme Tiomno's invitation and on the recommendation of both Einstein and Oppenheimer.\n\nDuring his early period, Bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics, particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory. As a postgraduate at Berkeley, he developed a theory of plasmas, discovering the electron phenomenon now known as Bohm diffusion. His first book, \"Quantum Theory\", published in 1951, was well received by Einstein, among others. But Bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book. Starting from the realization that the WKB approximation of quantum mechanics leads to deterministic equations and convinced that a mere approximation could not turn a probabilistic theory into a deterministic theory, he doubted the inevitability of the conventional approach to quantum mechanics.\n\nBohm's aim was not to set out a deterministic, mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality, in contrast to the conventional approach. He began to develop his own interpretation (the De Broglie–Bohm theory, also called the pilot wave theory), the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory. He initially called his approach a hidden variable theory, but he later called it \"ontological theory\", reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found. Bohm and his colleague Basil Hiley later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an \"interpretation in terms of hidden variables\" to be too restrictive, especially since their variables, position, and momentum \"are not actually hidden.\"\n\nBohm's work and the EPR argument became the major factor motivating John Stewart Bell's inequality, which rules out local hidden variable theories; the full consequences of Bell's work are still being investigated.\n\nAfter Bohm's arrival in Brazil on October 10, 1951, the US Consul in São Paulo confiscated his passport, informing him he could retrieve it only to return to his country, which reportedly frightened Bohm and significantly lowered his spirits, as he had hoped to travel to Europe. He applied for and received Brazilian citizenship, but by law, had to give up his US citizenship; he was able to reclaim it only decades later, in 1986, after pursuing a lawsuit.\n\nAt the University of São Paulo, Bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952. Jean-Pierre Vigier traveled to São Paulo, where he worked with Bohm for three months; Ralph Schiller, student of cosmologist Peter Bergmann, was his assistant for two years; he worked with Tiomno and Walther Schützer; and Mario Bunge stayed to work with him for one year. He was in contact with Brazilian physicists Mário Schenberg, Jean Meyer, Leite Lopes, and had discussions on occasion with visitors to Brazil, including Richard Feynman, Isidor Rabi, Léon Rosenfeld, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Herbert L. Anderson, Donald Kerst, Marcos Moshinsky, Alejandro Medina, and the former assistant to Heisenberg, Guido Beck, who encouraged him in his work and helped him to obtain funding. The Brazilian CNPq explicitly supported his work on the causal theory and funded several researchers around Bohm. His work with Vigier was the beginning of a long-standing cooperation between the two and Louis De Broglie, in particular, on connections to the hydrodynamics model proposed by Madelung. Yet the causal theory met much resistance and skepticism, with many physicists holding the Copenhagen interpretation to be the only viable approach to quantum mechanics.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1953, Bohm and David Pines published the articles in which they introduced the random phase approximation and proposed the plasmon.\n\nIn 1955 Bohm relocated to Israel, where he spent two years working at the Technion, at Haifa. There, he met Sarah (\"Saral\") Woolfson, whom he married in 1956.\n\nIn 1957, Bohm and his student Yakir Aharonov published a new version of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox, reformulating the original argument in terms of spin. It was that form of the EPR paradox that was discussed by John Stewart Bell in his famous paper of 1964.\n\nIn 1957, Bohm relocated to the United Kingdom as a research fellow at the University of Bristol. In 1959, Bohm and Aharonov discovered the Aharonov–Bohm effect, showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded, but its vector potential did not vanish there. That showed for the first time that the magnetic vector potential, hitherto a mathematical convenience, could have real physical (quantum) effects. \n\nIn 1961, Bohm was made professor of theoretical physics at the University of London's Birkbeck College, becoming emeritus in 1987. His collected papers are stored there.\n\nAt Birkbeck College, much of the work of Bohm and Basil Hiley expanded on the notion of implicate, explicate, and generative orders proposed by Bohm. In the view of Bohm and Hiley, \"things, such as particles, objects, and indeed subjects\" exist as \"semi-autonomous quasi-local features\" of an underlying activity. Such features can be considered to be independent only up to a certain level of approximation in which certain criteria are fulfilled. In that picture, the classical limit for quantum phenomena, in terms of a condition that the action function is not much greater than Planck's constant, indicates one such criterion. They used the word \"holomovement\" for the activity in such orders.\n\nIn collaboration with Stanford University neuroscientist Karl H. Pribram, Bohm was involved in the early development of the holonomic model of the functioning of the brain, a model for human cognition that is drastically different from conventionally-accepted ideas. Bohm worked with Pribram on the theory that the brain operates in a manner that is similar to a hologram, in accordance with quantum mathematical principles and the characteristics of wave patterns.\n\nIn addition to his scientific work, Bohm was deeply interested in exploring the nature of consciousness, with particular attention to the role of thought as it relates to attention, motivation, and conflict in the individual and in society. Those concerns were a natural extension of his earlier interest in Marxist ideology and Hegelian philosophy. His views were brought into sharper focus through extensive interactions with the psychological philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, beginning in 1961. Their collaboration lasted a quarter of a century, and their recorded dialogues were published in several volumes.\n\nBohm's prolonged involvement with the philosophy of Krishnamurti was regarded somewhat skeptically by some of his scientific peers. A more recent and extensive examination of the relationship between the two men presents it in a more positive light and shows that Bohm's work in the psychological field was complementary to and compatible with his contributions to theoretical physics.\n\nThe mature expression of Bohm's views in the psychological field was presented in a seminar conducted in 1990 at the Oak Grove School, founded by Krishnamurti in Ojai, California. It was one of a series of seminars held by Bohm at Oak Grove School, and it was published as \"Thought as a System\". In the seminar, Bohm described the pervasive influence of thought throughout society, including the many erroneous assumptions about the nature of thought and its effects in daily life.\n\nIn the seminar, Bohm develops several interrelated themes. He points out that thought is the ubiquitous tool that is used to solve every kind of problem: personal, social, scientific, and so on. Yet thought, he maintains, is also inadvertently the source of many of those problems. He recognizes and acknowledges the irony of the situation: it is as if one gets sick by going to the doctor.\n\nBohm maintains that thought is a system, in the sense that it is an interconnected network of concepts, ideas and assumptions that pass seamlessly between individuals and throughout society. If there is a fault in the functioning of thought, therefore, it must be a systemic fault, which infects the entire network. The thought that is brought to bear to resolve any given problem, therefore, is susceptible to the same flaw that created the problem it is trying to solve.\n\nThought proceeds as if it is merely reporting objectively, but in fact, it is often coloring and distorting perception in unexpected ways. What is required in order to correct the distortions introduced by thought, according to Bohm, is a form of proprioception, or self-awareness. Neural receptors throughout the body inform us directly of our physical position and movement, but there is no corresponding awareness of the activity of thought. Such an awareness would represent psychological proprioception and would enable the possibility of perceiving and correcting the unintended consequences of the thinking process.\n\nIn his book \"On Creativity\", quoting the work of Korzybski, Bohm expressed the view that \"metaphysics is an expression of a world view\" and is \"thus to be regarded as an art form, resembling poetry in some ways and mathematics in others, rather than as an attempt to say something true about reality as a whole.\"\n\nBohm was keenly aware of various ideas outside the scientific mainstream. In his book \"Science, Order and Creativity\", Bohm referred to the views of various biologists on the evolution of the species, including Rupert Sheldrake. He also knew the ideas of Wilhelm Reich.\n\nContrary to many other scientists, Bohm did not exclude the paranormal out of hand. Bohm temporarily even held Uri Geller's bending of keys and spoons to be possible, prompting warning remarks by his colleague Basil Hiley that it might undermine the scientific credibility of their work in physics. Martin Gardner reported this in a \"Skeptical Inquirer\" article and also critiqued the views of Jiddu Krishnamurti, with whom Bohm had met in 1959 and had had many subsequent exchanges. Gardner said that Bohm's view of the interconnectedness of mind and matter (on one occasion, he summarized, \"Even the electron is informed with a certain level of mind.\") \"flirted with panpsychism.\"\n\nTo address societal problems during his later years, Bohm wrote a proposal for a solution that has become known as \"Bohm Dialogue\", in which equal status and \"free space\" form the most important prerequisites of communication and the appreciation of differing personal beliefs. An essential ingredient in this form of dialogue is that participants \"suspend\" immediate action or judgment and give themselves and each other the opportunity to become aware of the thought process itself. Bohm suggested that if the \"dialogue groups\" were experienced on a sufficiently-wide scale, they could help overcome the isolation and fragmentation that Bohm observed in society.\n\nBohm continued his work in quantum physics after his retirement, in 1987. His final work, the posthumously-published \"The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory\" (1993), resulted from a decades-long collaboration with Basil Hiley. He also spoke to audiences across Europe and North America on the importance of dialogue as a form of sociotherapy, a concept he borrowed from London psychiatrist and practitioner of Group Analysis Patrick de Maré, and he had a series of meetings with the Dalai Lama. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1990.\n\nNear the end of his life, Bohm began to experience a recurrence of the depression that he had suffered earlier in life. He was admitted to the Maudsley Hospital in South London on 10 May 1991. His condition worsened and it was decided that the only treatment that might help him was electroconvulsive therapy. Bohm's wife consulted psychiatrist David Shainberg, Bohm's longtime friend and collaborator, who agreed that electroconvulsive treatments were probably his only option. Bohm showed improvement from the treatments and was released on 29 August, but his depression returned and was treated with medication.\n\nBohm died after suffering a heart attack in Hendon, London, on 27 October 1992, at 74.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Bohm's causal quantum theory program was mostly negatively received, with a widespread tendency among physicists to systematically ignore both Bohm personally and his ideas. There was a significant revival of interest in Bohm's ideas in the late 1950s and the early 1960s; the Ninth Symposium of the Colston Research Society in Bristol in 1957 was a key turning point toward greater tolerance of his ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Between 1836 and 1840, he killed several dozen people. The crimes he committed were all in the area of the Águas Livres Aqueduct, thus earning the \"Aqueduct Murderer\". He was sentenced to death and hanged on February 19, 1841. The head of the killer was separated from the body and placed in a flask to preserve it for scientific purposes, where it is now a tourist attraction.\n\nBorn in Galicia in a peasant family, Alves fell from the family horse while at a young age and hit his head, earning the nickname Pancada (\"blow\"). At the age of nineteen, his parents sent him to work in Lisbon. After changing several jobs and ceasing to write to his parents, he began to drink and gamble, meeting up with innkeeper Maria \"Parreirinha\" Gertrudes. It is believed that this connection instigated Alves to kill. He began to commit crimes, earning a second nickname \"The Aqueduct Murderer\". He robbed poor passers-by, and then dumped them from a height of 60 meters to simultaneously avoid identification and present the deaths as suicides, which he initially succeeded in.\n\nMurders on the aqueduct remained unproven, but the jury sentenced Alves and his gang for other crimes, in particular, murdering the four family members of a doctor. Maria's 11-year-old daughter, Maria de Conceicao, testified in court against the gang. Her mother was eventually sent to a lifelong exile in African colonies.\n\nAlves became the penultimate (often mistakenly claimed to be the last) hanged criminal in Portugal. His actions at the time intrigued scientists from the then Medical-Surgical School of Lisbon. After his hanging, in an attempt to study his brain, Alves' head was cut off and studied. To this day it is still preserved in a glass vessel, where a solution of formaldehyde has perpetuated the image of calm man—quite contrary to what he really was. Scientists could never explain what led him to buy a false key for the Aqueducts, where he was hiding, and how many people he had robbed and killed.The severed head is currently in the anatomical theater of the University of Lisbon's Faculty of Medicine, following the formation of a phrenology cabinet made by José Lourenço da Luz Gomes, which allowed the preservation of Alves' skull, along with that of Matos Lobo (being one of the last subjects to whom the death penalty in Portugal was applied, something quite significant for the judicial history of Portugal) in the old medical-surgical school. The head of Diogo Alves was one of the most significant—and undoubtedly horrific—objects of the passage in \"One hundred pieces for the Museum of Medicine\", which took place in the National Museum of Ancient Art in 2005.\n\n"}

Broussard\n\nEdwin Sidney Broussard (December 4, 1874 – November 19, 1934), was a United States senator from Louisiana, with serve for two terms from March 5, 1921, to March 3, 1933. \n\nBroussard was born in the village of Loreauville, Louisiana, and attended public schools. He graduated in 1896 from the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He taught for two years thereafter in the public schools of Iberia and St. Martin parishes.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Broussard volunteered for the United States Army. A captain in Cuba, in 1898 and 1899, he accompanied the Taft Commission to the Philippine Islands in 1899 and served as an assistant secretary. He returned to the United States in 1900 and graduated the next year from the Tulane University Law School in New Orleans. In 1901, he was admitted in 1901 to the bar and established his practice in New Iberia, the Iberia Parish seat of government.\n\nBroussard was prosecuting attorney for the Louisiana 19th Judicial District from 1903 to 1908. Between 1914 and 1916, he affiliated with the Progressive Party, formed by Theodore Roosevelt, who had gained national attention for organizing the Rough Riders in the Spanish–American War. Broussard opposed the New Orleans Democratic party machine, known as the Old Regulars. Broussard ran unsuccessfully in 1916 for lieutenant governor on an intra-party Progressive ticket with gubernatorial candidate John M. Parker, another Roosevelt loyalist. Broussard lost to Fernand Mouton. Parker was defeated that year too by Ruffin G. Pleasant of Shreveport, but rebounded to victory for governor in 1920 as a Democrat.\n\nIn 1920, Broussard was elected as a Democrat to fill the seat vacated two years earlier by his late brother, U. S. Senator Robert F. Broussard. He defeated conservative former Governor Jared Y. Sanders, Sr. Broussard was a strong advocate of the sugar tariff and federal flood control projects important to his state. He was reelected in 1926 by defeating Sanders once again and with the then support of Louisiana Public Service Commissioner and later Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr. The Ku Klux Klan rallied against Broussard because of his Roman Catholicism in support of Sanders. He was denied renomination in the 1932 Democratic primary election by Huey Long's choice for the position, John Holmes Overton of Alexandria in Rapides Parish.\n\nLong had backed Broussard in 1926 and Broussard had supported Long for governor in 1928 but not for senator in 1930. Broussard had called upon Long as senator-elect to resign as governor and turn over the office to Lieutenant Governor Paul N. Cyr, a Long former ally turned opponent. Long remained senator-elect for more than a year, however, and did not work well with Broussard as his fellow senator. Broussard even praised his own former opponent, Jared Y. Sanders, whom Long had helped Broussard to defeat. Long by then considered Broussard \"a conservative\" in the mold of Sanders and favored the more moderate Overton as Broussard's Senate replacement. \n\nIn his autobiography, \"Every Man a King\", Long took credit for Broussard's re-election to his second Senate term: \"I supported him, and he hasn't a friend in the state who would say that he could have been elected to the Senate in 1926 if it had not been for me. ... Are his attacks on me a return of such favors? Is that the way some people have of repaying others for help that they get from them? ... Now Senator Broussard attacks me, without cause, and praises J. Y. Sanders. ...\"\n\nAfter his defeat, Broussard resumed his law practice and tended to banking and financial affairs in New Iberia, where he died in 1934 and is interred there at St. Peter's Cemetery.\n\nOn June 5, 1904, Broussard married Marie Clair Patout (18781945), the daughter of Felix Patout (18341918) and French woman Claire Tate (18541913). The couple had six children, including Mary Louise Broussard Brown (1910–2010); John Dorville Broussard (1913–1989); Edwin S. Broussard, II; George P. Broussard (1916–1977), a veterinary medicine researcher; and Eugene D. Broussard (1917–2008).\n\n"}

In 1988, she became deputy chief editor of \"Economics Weekly\", edited by dissident intellectuals. She also worked as a freelance journalist for different newspapers in China and in Hong Kong. In November 1988, she published an article in Hong Kong’s \"Mirror Monthly\", which was described by Beijing's Mayor Chen Xitong as a \"political program for turmoil and rebellion\". He even branded her as a \"people's enemy\". She was arrested in 1989, after the Tiananmen Square protests, and released 15 months later because of health problems.\n\nGao was arrested again in October 1993, and in November 1994 was sentenced to six years, accused of having \"published state secrets\". In February 1999, she was given parole in poor health.\n\nIn 2014, Gao was arrested again a few weeks ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The detention of the outspoken 70-year-old journalist was just one of several detentions of government critics over the previous days ahead of the politically sensitive 4 June anniversary.\n\nIn April 2015, Beijing's high court convicted Gao of leaking state secrets and sentenced her to seven years in prison. According to Reporters Without Borders, the authorities accused Gao of sending \"Document Number Nine\" to a foreign news organization, although the document had already been posted online. Following an appeal, her sentence was reduced to five years on 26 November 2015. Hours later, Chinese state media announced she has been released on medical parole, however the conviction for leaking state secrets was not overturned. As of 2016, she is serving a five-year sentence under house arrest.\n\nGerman president Joachim Gauck, on his first state visit to China in March 2016, raised the plight of Gao with the Chinese government. Gao once wrote for the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Days after Gauck's comments on Gao, Beijing municipal authorities and police raided her home, demolishing her study which they claimed was an illegal structure, and ransacking the rest of her home. Gao put up a fight but collapsed due to apparent high blood pressure. Gao stated that the raid was illegal and the authorities gave no advance notice. Sources claimed that the raid was conducted in retaliation for the German premier's comments. Gao's home has been ransacked by the police before, when they came to arrest her in 2014.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Gao Yu received the WAN-IFRA (World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers) Golden Pen of Freedom and the IWMF (International Women's Media Foundation) \"Courage in Journalism Award\" in 1995.

After the regicide of his half brother King Alexander in 1903 George became a claimant to the Serbian throne in opposition to the new king, Peter I Karadordevic before ending his life in obscurity.\n\nAlthough commonly known as George Obrenović he was born in Belgrade as Obren Hristić. Acknowledged by King Milan as his son, he was given the name Obren at birth to underline his kinship to the ruling House of Obrenović. The husband of George’s mother was Milan Hristić, the king’s private secretary and son of the Serbian statesman Filip Hristić.\n\nThe relationship between the parents of George and the fact his mother was living in the Royal Palace, caused a great scandal and resulted in Queen Natalie fleeing Belgrade with her son Crown Prince Alexander for Wiesbaden in the German Empire. His mother’s husband was subsequently removed from his position as private secretary and sent abroad as Serbian Minister to Berlin on condition his wife stays in Belgrade. This appointment fell through however after the Berlin court made it clear he was unwelcome so he was instead sent to Rome. Although King Milan had given a written promise of marriage to Artemisia his attempts to divorce Queen Natalie were opposed by Michael, the Metropolitan of Belgrade.\n\nEventually both of George’s parents secured divorces from their respective spouses. Five months after his divorce on 6 March 1889 King Milan abdicated from the Serbian throne angering George’s mother. After eventually growing tired of ex-King Milan’s demands for money from her, Artemisa took George to live in Constantinople where her father lived and had acquired substantial wealth first as a landscape gardener and architect to the Ottoman sultan and later in Banking. Ex-King Milan then broke off his promise of marriage and turned instead to the Serbian government for financial assistance and was eventually even reconciled with his ex-wife Queen Natalie on 8 March 1893.\n\nWith the breakdown of the relationship of his parents George was raised in a privileged environment by his mother in Constantinople. Following the death in 1901 of his father in exile in Vienna, George’s life changed. Some of his late father’s friends who were appalled by his half brother King Alexander’s treatment of King Milan took an interest in him as a possible candidate for the Serbian throne. One friend, the Hungarian count Eugene Zichy, assumed the role of his guardian. Count Eugene generally treated him as his own son and attempted to get the agreement of Emperor Franz Joseph I to enrol George in the Theresian Military Academy. However, as his pretensions to the Serbian throne were not viewed favourably in Vienna the emperor refused to allow his enrolment.\n\nAlthough the natural son of King Milan and even though his half brother and his consort Queen Draga were without an heir George was not seen by his half brother as a possible successor to the throne. Instead the queens brother Nikodije Lunjevica and Prince Mirko of Montenegro, who was married to Natalija Konstantinović (granddaughter of Princess Anka Obrenović) were talked of as being named the heir.\n\nAfter the regicide of his half brother King Alexander and his consort Queen Draga in 1903 the throne of Serbia was offered to Prince Peter Karageorgevich whose family had a decades long feud with the Obrenović’s over the throne. As the sole male line descendant of the Obrenović’s, George’s guardian Count Eugene claimed that his father King Milan had legally adopted him and as such this was enough to legitimise him, and his claims to the throne and make him the heir to his father and half brother. George had support within Serbia in the aftermath of the regicide with his supporters posting proclamations in Belgrade and fighting with supporters of the newly elected king, Peter Karageorgevich. Although there were reports that George and his mother were to cross over into Serbia nothing came of this and the Ottoman sultan advised his mother that he should be kept off the streets over fears that he would be assassinated.\n\nIn 1906, three years after the death of his half brother and the accession of King Peter Karageorgevich, George made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the throne of Serbia. In June while studying in Klausenburg, Hungary a dispute in a coffee shop led to a duel with swords being fought between George and a university student. Although he survived the duel he came off worse sustaining injuries to his head, shoulder and breast. He suffered a further blow at the end of that year when his guardian Count Eugene Zichy died on Boxing Day leaving George little in his will having used his own money to support his pretensions, as King Milan had left nothing to his son. All was not lost however as he still had a large inheritance to look forward to from his grandfather in Constantinople.\n\nBack in the Ottoman capital in February 1907 George survived an assassination attempt when a man wielding a dagger attempted to stab him in his chest, however he escaped with just a scratch after the dagger hit a thick pocket book he was carrying. Five months later in July 1907 a bomb went off outside the US Embassy in Constantinople. As George lived in a house adjourning the embassy word spread that it was an assassination attempt by agents of King Peter Karageorgevich. This explanation for the bombing was met with some scepticism and viewed by some as an attempt to use the explosion to keep George in the public eye. The following month it was reported that he had attempted to take his own life after the Ottoman authorities had refused to allow him to assume the surname Obrenović. There may however have been other issues on his mind as an investigation into the bombing concluded that George had set it up himself to make it look like an attempt on his life. As a result, he was expelled from Turkey by the Sultan. The discovery also cost George his inheritance from his grandfather who was furious at his grandsons actions wrote him out of his will. His grandfather died later that year before any chance for reconciliation could ever take place.\nNow banished from Turkey George made his way to Paris before heading to Austria-Hungary where he received some support from his late father’s friends who saw the potential that he may oneday ascend the Serbian throne. To help boost his finances failed attempts were also made to secure a rich wife from Austria-Hungary or America for him. When the support came to an end he largely disappeared from view travelling around Europe and falling into debt. Eventually he fell into comparative poverty and tried his hand at a number of different jobs to survive. After his attempt to work in the Austro-Hungarian state ministries failed due his lack of qualifications he worked at various jobs such as a stable boy and professional jockey before trying his hand at singing in Café’s and on stage, until he was forced to abandon that career by the police due to the fact he had been billing himself as a prince. He then went on to work as a waiter, and a porter in sleeping cars on the Orient Express. His name reappeared in connection to his old pretensions during the World War I when it was falsely reported in January 1916 that he had been proclaimed King of Serbia by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians.\n\nGeorge later went on to become a writer however the only book he ever wrote, which was about the life of his father King Milan, was suppressed by the Serbian government. George Obrenović died penniless in a Hungarian poorhouse on 9 October 1925.\n\nAccording to a 2003 article by the Serbian media company Novosti AD, George had a son called Stefan who served as a cavalry captain in the French Army. Stefan in turn had a son named Panta (Panka) Obrenović (also known as Mark Eme) who served as chairman of the \"Fund Obrenović\" until his death in Paris in early 2002.\n"}

Their 2010 \"Hamish & Andy's Reministmas Special\" recapped their adventures during the year, mostly as part of their radio show.\n\nIn addition to these, they produced three travel specials for Ten. \"Hamish & Andy's American Caravan of Courage\" in 2009 (another Roving Enterprises co-production) summarised their two-week road-trip across the United States. Similarly, 2010's \"\" recapped their next caravan trip made as part of their radio show. Their third travel special, \"Learn India with Hamish & Andy\", aired as part of the network's lead-up to the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.\n\nFollowing a series of media reports, the pair confirmed in February 2011 that they had joined the Nine Network on a two-year contract, to produce \"Hamish and Andy's Gap Year\". The show first aired on 28 July 2011. The show premiered to strong ratings and has since gone onto three more seasons (\"Hamish & Andy's Euro Gap Year\" in 2012 and \"Hamish & Andy's Gap Year Asia\" in 2013 and \"Hamish & Andy's Gap Year South America\" in 2014).\n\nThe pair also filmed a fifth adventure in 2012, in which they compared their home country, Australia, to their neighbours New Zealand in two 90-minute specials.\n\nIn December 2016, the duo announced that 2017 would be their last year on radio, in order to focus on television. They also announced an as yet unnamed TV show to be aired on the Nine Network in mid 2017. The duo advertised on their website and radio show, for listeners to contribute \"great stories\" for \"The Great Stories Project\" which was the basis of their 2017 television show \"True Story with Hamish & Andy\" on the Nine Network.\n\nOn 7 July 2007 they presented the Australian leg of Live Earth and also appeared at the Melbourne Sound Relief concert in 2009. They played in the 2008 and 2009 E. J. Whitten Legends Game. They also made a mockumentary short film \"The Greystone 2800\", that won the 2005 Melbourne Comedy Festival Short Film competition. They also hosted FHM's \"Search for Australia's Funniest Man\".\n\nThey had a minor acting role on soap opera, \"Neighbours\", portraying radio presenters Fred and Big Tommo on the episode dated 27 August 2008. The episode featured them promoting university drop-out Ty Harper's (Dean Geyer) band, and interviewing schoolgirls Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) and Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie) about their situation with Harper. They make a cameo appearance in the 2010 short film \"IA: Interview Artist\".\n\nThey have also made appearances on many Austereo radio shows, occasionally filling in for Kyle & Jackie O, Matt & Jo or Fifi and Jules when a regular presenter fell ill.\n\nHamish and Andy hosted the richest horse suit race in Australia in the small Victorian country town of Wedderburn. It drew about 7000 people and featured performances from themselves, Jessica Mauboy, and Birds of Tokyo.\n\n\n"}

At that time, Lwengo District was still part of Masaka District. He is the son of Hajji Ali Nganda Nkwanga and Hajati Sophia Nalwooga, one of his forty-eight children and one of her sixteen offspring.\n\nHe attended the Bijaaba Islamic Institute, \"a few meters from his birthplace\", obtaining the Primary Leaving Certificate while there. After the institute started a secondary school section, Ssemujju joined. However, by Senior 2, most of his female classmates had found husbands and dropped out, while his male cohorts left for odd jobs in nearby Masaka Town. He raised whatever little capital he could and convinced his father to enroll him in Masaka Secondary School for his Senior 3 studies. At that time, he barely spoke any English, but they admitted him anyway.\n\nHe progressively did well and passed his O-Level examinations in 1992. He went on to pursue his A-Level education, also at Masaka Secondary School. He graduated at the top of his class in 1995. He was admitted to Makerere University, on a full Ugandan government scholarship to study mass communication. He graduated in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts mass communication.\n\nStraight out of Makerere, he was hired as a reporter for the \"Daily Monitor\", one of the two leading English language daily newspapers in Uganda, serving in that role until 2004.

{"id": "344336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344336", "title": "Jim Lovell", "text": "Jim Lovell\n\nJames Arthur Lovell Jr. (; born March 25, 1928) is a former NASA astronaut, Naval Aviator, and retired Navy captain. Lovell is known for being the commander of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, which suffered a critical failure en route to the Moon but was brought back safely to Earth through the efforts of the crew and mission control. In addition to being part of the Apollo 13 crew, Lovell was the command module pilot of Apollo 8, the first Apollo mission to enter lunar orbit.\n\nHe is one of only 24 people to have flown to the Moon and the first of only three people to fly to the Moon twice as well as the only one to have flown there twice without making a landing. Lovell was the first person to fly in space four times.\n\nHe is a recipient of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (in 1970, one of 17 recipients in the group Space Exploration).\n\nBorn in 1928 in Cleveland, Ohio, James Lovell was the only child of his mother Blanche (Masek), who was of Czech descent, and his father, James, Sr., an Ontario, Canada-born coal furnace salesman, who died in a car accident in 1933. For about two years, Lovell and his mother lived with a relative in Terre Haute, Indiana. After relocating with his mother to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he graduated from Juneau High School. A member of the Boy Scouts during his childhood, Lovell eventually achieved Eagle Scout, the organization's highest level.\n\nLovell became interested in rocketry and built flying models as a boy. After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison for two years under the \"Flying Midshipman\" program from 1946 to 1948. While at Madison, he played football and pledged to the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity.\n\nWhile Lovell was attending pre-flight training in the summer of 1948, the navy was beginning to make cutbacks in the program, and cadets were under a great deal of pressure to transfer out. There were concerns that some or most of the students who graduated as Naval Aviators would not have pilot billets to fill. This threat persisted until the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. Lovell applied and was accepted to the United States Naval Academy in the fall of 1948. During his first year he wrote a treatise on the liquid-fueled rocket engine. He attended Annapolis for the full four years, graduating as an ensign in the spring of 1952 with a B.S. degree. He then went to flight training at NAS Pensacola from October 1952 to February 1954.\nIn 1952, following his graduation from the Naval Academy, Lovell married his high school sweetheart, Marilyn Lillie Gerlach (born July 11, 1930), the daughter of Lillie (née Nordrum) and Carl Gerlach. The two had attended Juneau High School in Milwaukee. While she was a college student, Gerlach transferred from Wisconsin State Teachers College to George Washington University in Washington D.C. so she could be near him while he was training in Annapolis.\n\nThe couple have four children: Barbara, James, Susan, and Jeffrey. The 1995 film \"Apollo 13\" portrayed the family's home life during the Apollo 13 mission of 1970 with actress Kathleen Quinlan being nominated for a supporting actress Oscar for her performance as Marilyn Lovell.\n\nIn 1999 the Lovell family opened \"Lovell's of Lake Forest\", a fine dining restaurant in Lake Forest, Illinois. The restaurant displayed many artifacts from Lovell's time with NASA, as well as from the filming of \"Apollo 13\". The restaurant was sold to son and executive chef James (\"Jay\") in 2006. The restaurant was put on the market for sale in February 2014 and closed in April 2015, with the property auctioned the same month.\n\nLovell was designated a Naval Aviator on February 1, 1954. Upon completion of pilot training, he was assigned to VC-3 at Moffett Field near San Francisco, California. From 1954 to 1956 he flew F2H-3 Banshee night fighters. This included a WestPac deployment aboard the carrier , when the ship emerged from refit as only the second USN carrier with the new angled deck. Upon his return to shore duty, he was reassigned to provide pilot transition training for the F3H Demon. In January 1958, Lovell entered a six-month test pilot training course at what was then the Naval Air Test Center (now the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School) at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. Two of his classmates were Charles (Peter) Conrad and Wally Schirra; Lovell graduated first in his class.\n\nLater that year, Lovell, Conrad, and Schirra became three of 110 military test pilots selected as potential astronaut candidates for Project Mercury. Schirra went on to become one of the Mercury Seven, with Lovell and Conrad failing to make the cut for medical reasons: Lovell because of a temporarily high bilirubin count in his blood and Conrad for refusing to take the second round of invasive medical tests.\n\nAt NAS Patuxent River, Lovell was assigned to Electronics Test (later Weapons Test), with his assigned call sign being \"Shaky\", a nickname given him by Conrad. He became F4H program manager, during which time John Young served under him. In 1961 he received orders for VF-101 \"Detachment Alpha\" as an F4H instructor for the first East Coast squadron personnel assigned to that aircraft.\n\nIn 1962 NASA needed a second group of astronauts for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Lovell applied a second time and was accepted into NASA Astronaut Group 2, \"The New Nine\", as was Conrad.\n\nLovell was selected as backup pilot for Gemini 4. This put him in position for his first space flight three missions later, as pilot of Gemini 7 with Command Pilot Frank Borman in December 1965. The flight's objective was to evaluate the effects on the crew and spacecraft from fourteen days in orbit. This fourteen-day flight set an endurance record making 206 orbits. It was also the target vehicle for the first space rendezvous with Gemini 6A.\n\nLovell was later scheduled to be the backup command pilot of Gemini 10. But after the deaths of the Gemini 9 prime crew Elliot See and Charles Bassett, he replaced Thomas P. Stafford as backup commander of Gemini 9A. This again positioned Lovell for his second flight and first command, of Gemini 12 in November 1966 with Pilot Buzz Aldrin. This flight had three extravehicular activities, made 59 orbits, and achieved the fifth space rendezvous and fourth space docking with an Agena target vehicle. This mission was successful because it proved that humans can work effectively outside the spacecraft, paved the way for the Apollo missions, and helped reach the goal of getting man on the Moon by the end of the decade.\n\nLovell was originally chosen as Command Module pilot (CMP) on the backup crew for Apollo 9 along with Neil Armstrong as commander and Buzz Aldrin as lunar module pilot (LMP). Apollo 9 was planned as a high-apogee Earth orbital test of the Lunar Module (LM). Lovell later replaced Michael Collins as CMP on the Apollo 9 prime crew when Collins needed to have surgery for a bone spur on his spine. This reunited Lovell with his Gemini 7 commander Frank Borman, and LM pilot William Anders.\n\nConstruction delays of the first manned LM prevented it from being ready in time to fly on Apollo 8, planned as a low Earth orbit test. It was decided to swap the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 prime and backup crews in the flight schedule so that the crew trained for the low-orbit test could fly it as Apollo 9, when the LM would be ready. A lunar orbital flight, now Apollo 8 replaced the original Apollo 9 medium Earth orbit test. Borman, Lovell and Anders were launched on December 21, 1968, becoming the first men to travel to the Moon.\n\nAs CM Pilot, Lovell served as the navigator, using the spacecraft's built-in sextant to determine its position by measuring star positions. This information was then used to calculate required mid-course corrections. The craft entered lunar orbit on Christmas Eve and made a total of ten orbits, most of them circular at an altitude of approximately for a total of twenty hours. They broadcast black-and-white television pictures of the lunar surface back to Earth. Lovell took his turn with Borman and Anders in reading a passage from the Biblical creation story in the Book of Genesis.\n\nThey began their return to Earth on Christmas Day with a rocket burn made on the Moon's far side, out of radio contact with Earth. (For this reason, the lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection burns were the two most tense moments of this first lunar mission.) When contact was re-established, Lovell was the first to announce the good news, \"Please be informed, there is a Santa Claus.\" The crew splashed down safely on Earth on December 27.\n\nLovell was backup commander of Apollo 11 and was scheduled to command Apollo 14. Instead, he and his crew swapped missions with the crew of Apollo 13, as it was felt the commander of the other crew, Alan Shepard, needed more time to train after having been grounded for a long period by an ear problem. Lovell lifted off aboard Apollo 13 on April 11, 1970, with CM Pilot Jack Swigert and LM Pilot Fred Haise. He and Haise were to land on the Moon.\n\nDuring a routine cryogenic oxygen tank stir in transit to the Moon, a fire started inside an oxygen tank. The most probable cause determined by NASA was damaged electrical insulation on wiring that created a spark that started the fire. Liquid oxygen rapidly turned into a high-pressure gas, which burst the tank and caused the leak of a second oxygen tank. In just over two hours, all on-board oxygen was lost, disabling the hydrogen fuel cells that provided electrical power to the Command/Service Module \"Odyssey\". This required an immediate abort of the Moon landing mission; the sole objective now was to safely return the crew to Earth.\n\nApollo 13 was the second mission not to use a free return trajectory, so that they could explore the western lunar regions. Using the LM as a \"life boat\" providing battery power, oxygen, and propulsion, Lovell and his crew re-established the free return trajectory that they had left, and swung around the Moon to return home. Based on the flight controllers' calculations made on Earth, Lovell had to adjust the course twice by manually controlling the Lunar Module's thrusters and engine. Apollo 13 returned safely to Earth on April 17.\n\nLovell is one of only three men to travel to the Moon twice, but unlike John Young and Eugene Cernan, he never walked on it. He accrued over 715 hours, and had seen a total of 269 sunrises from space, on his Gemini and Apollo flights. This was a personal record that stood until the Skylab 3 mission in July through September 1973. Apollo 13's flight trajectory gives Lovell, Haise, and Swigert the record for the farthest distance that humans have ever traveled from Earth.\n\nLovell retired from the Navy and the space program in 1973 and went to work at the Bay-Houston Towing Company in Houston, Texas, becoming CEO in 1975. He became president of Fisk Telephone Systems in 1977, and later worked for Centel, retiring as an executive vice president on January 1, 1991. Lovell, a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, later served as the President of the National Eagle Scout Association in the mid-1990s. He was also recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with their prestigious Silver Buffalo Award.\n\nAlong with Jeffrey Kluger, Lovell wrote a book about the Apollo 13 mission, \"Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13\". It was the basis for the Ron Howard movie \"Apollo 13\". Lovell's first impression on being approached about the film was that Kevin Costner would be a good choice to portray him, given the physical resemblance, but Tom Hanks was cast in the role. In order to prepare, Hanks visited Lovell and his wife at their home in Texas and even flew with Lovell in his private airplane.\n\nIn the film, Lovell has a cameo as the captain of the USS \"Iwo Jima\", the naval vessel that led the operation to recover the Apollo 13 astronauts after their successful splashdown. Lovell can be seen as the naval officer shaking Hanks' hand, as Hanks speaks in voice-over, in the scene where the astronauts come aboard the \"Iwo Jima\". Filmmakers initially offered to make Lovell's character an admiral aboard the ship (presumably Rear Admiral Donald C. Davis, Commander Task Force 130 (CTF 130), who was the senior officer aboard and welcomed them home). However, Lovell said \"I retired as a Captain and a Captain I will be.\" He was cast as the ship's skipper, Captain Leland E. Kirkemo. Along with his wife Marilyn, who also has a cameo in the film, he provided a commentary track on both the single disc and the two-disc special edition DVD.\n\nHe has served on the Board of Directors for several organizations, including Federal Signal Corporation in Chicago (1984–2003), Astronautics Corporation of America in his hometown of Milwaukee (1990–1999), and Centel Corporation in Chicago (1987–1991).\n\nLovell also visits colleges and universities where he gives speeches on his experiences as an astronaut and businessman. He strongly urges students to get involved in science and the space program, and he credits NASA in the 1960s with bringing much of the country together for a common goal.\n\nA small crater on the far side of the Moon is named \"Lovell\" in his honor.\n\n\"North James Lovell Street\" is the stretch of 7th Street between W. State Street and W. Clybourn Street in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nDiscovery World in Milwaukee was also named \"The James Lovell Museum of Science, Economics and Technology\". It was located on James Lovell St., also named for Lovell.\n\nThe \"Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center\" was completed in October 2010, merging the Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes and the North Chicago Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nLovell Court is a street in the North Harbour Industrial Estate on the north shore of Auckland, New Zealand. Several streets in the area have names whose origins honor the US Apollo and Space Shuttle programs, including Armstrong Drive, Columbia Place, John Glenn Avenue, and Ride Way.\n\nLovell's formal education consisted of the following:\n\nLovell's awards and decorations include:\n\n\nAbout a month after the return to Earth of Apollo 13, Lovell and his crewmates, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with host Johnny Carson. The introduction of this segment of the show is featured on \"Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13\" on the single disc DVD version of the movie. In 1976, Lovell made a cameo appearance in the Nicolas Roeg movie \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\".\n\nIn 1995, actor Tom Hanks portrayed Lovell in the hit movie \"Apollo 13\", based on Lovell's book \"Lost Moon\". Lovell himself makes a cameo in this movie, playing the captain of the USS \"Iwo Jima\" at the end of the film. In 1998, actor Tim Daly portrayed Lovell in portions of the HBO miniseries \"From the Earth to the Moon\". The film depicts Lovell during his missions aboard Gemini 12, Apollo 8, and Apollo 13, though he is not seen on screen during the latter mission.\n\nLovell is one of the astronauts featured in the book and documentaries \"In the Shadow of the Moon\" and \"When We Left Earth\".\n\nOn November 13, 2008, Lovell and fellow Apollo 8 crew members Frank Borman and Bill Anders appeared on the NASA TV channel to discuss the Apollo 8 mission. The three former astronauts later appeared together for a panel discussion centering on Apollo 8 at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library on April 23, 2009, a discussion that was videotaped by C-SPAN.\n\nOn July 20, 2014, the 45th anniversary of Apollo 11's landing on the Moon, \"CBS Sunday Morning\" correspondent Lee Cowan and his crew did a piece called \"Astronaut wives: The other space pioneers\" featuring James Lovell and his wife Marilyn. They celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary in June. \n\nIn 2018, actor Pablo Schreiber portrayed Lovell in the film \"First Man\".\n\n"}

Elizabeth's brother and Hick's uncle, Joshua Routledge (1773–1829) also an engineer living in Bolton, designed the \"Engineer's Improved Slide Rule\" and patented improvements to the Rotary Steam Engine.\n\nEducated at a private school near Alderley, Cheshire and Bolton Grammar School where he received a commercial and classical education, Hick entered Benjamin Hick's Soho Works from school and from a young age, management of the Bolton engineering firm Benjamin Hick and Son with his father. Following Benjamin Hick's death in 1842, Hick became senior partner in the family business, later Hick, Hargreaves, & Co and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1845.\n\nHe was Church Warden for James Slade, Governor of Bolton Grammar School, Town councillor for nine years from 1844, a member of the Society of Arts, founder member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers from 1847 until 1852, member of the London Association of Foreman Engineers and Draughtsman, National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church in England and Wales, Justice of the Peace for the Borough of Bolton and Salford Hundred, liberal patron of the fine arts and a director of the London and North Western Railway under the chairmanship of Sir Richard Moon and Lord Stalbridge, from 1871 until his death.\n\nIn 1839 (age 23) while working for B. Hick and Son, John Hick Jr as he was referred to at the time, was awarded the Silver Medal by the Society of Arts for his novel invention of an expanding mandrel for turning lathes, it was an adaptation of a principle developed by Marc Brunel for pully block manufacture at Portsmouth and received the praise of three eminent engineers; Bryan Donkin, Joshua Field and John Rennie.\n\nDuring 1842 Hick was awarded a second silver medal by the Society of Arts for his invention of an Elliptograph; conceived in 1840, the device provided a simple and accurate solution for the drawing \"ellipsoid forms\" of various proportions. Hick received further praise from James Nasmyth, William Fairbairn, Joseph Whitworth, and amongst others, Charles Holtzapffel, Chairman of the Committee of Mechanics. Models of both devices were placed in the Society's repository.\n\nHick contributed a paper to the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 1849 on a friction clutch \"for connecting and disconnecting the driving power with shafts and machinery\". A B. Hick and Son, 1:12 scale patent model of \"disconnecting apparatus, for screw propellers\", c. 1855 is held in the Science Museum marine engines collection.\n\nJohn Hick married Margaret Bashall (1824–1872), eldest daughter of industrialist William Bashall, partner in Bashall & Boardman of Farington Lodge, near Preston on 24 June 1846, they raised four daughters.\n\nFollowing Margaret Hick's death in 1872, Hick married the sister of his son-in-law, Rebecca Maria Ashworth (1838–1908), eldest daughter of Edmund Ashworth JP (1800–1881) of Egerton Hall on 16 December 1874 at Holy Trinity Church, Clapham; the couple were married by Margaret Hick's cousin and brother-in-law Reverend William Bashall (1830–1902), Vicar of Deane, Lancashire, by special licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Archibald Tait. Edmund Ashworth was a cotton manufacturer, proprietor of E. Ashworth & Sons and Egerton Mill, founder member of the Anti-Corn Law League with his brother Henry Ashworth (1794–1880) JP, in association with John Bright and Richard Cobden (Henry Ashworth's brother-in-law), and supporter of reforming, anti-slavery and peace organisations. The Ashworths are both thought to have been Oswald Millbank in Benjamin Disraeli's novel \"Coningsby\". The two families (Hick and Ashworth) were linked by marriage in 1868 when Hick's first child and eldest daughter Margaret (1847–1929) married Edmund Ashworth Jr (1833–1901). The \"highly respected\" Reverend Bashall retired to the position of curate at St Barnabas church, Addison Road, Kensington from about 1876 remaining in the area until his death, 1902.\n\n1851 saw the Crystal Palace Exhibition in Hyde Park; early in 1850\nMayor of Bolton, Thomas Lever Rushton (1810–1883) was appointed chairman of a committee to organise the town's efforts toward the Exhibition and presented as a Local Commissioner to Prince Albert at St James's Palace 18 March 1850.\n\nWhile the family business of Benjamin Hick and Son displayed machinery and engineering models in the Crystal Palace, John Hick also sat as a United Kingdom Juror with the notable figures of Wilhelm Engerth, William Fairbairn, John Farey, Henry Maudslay (1822–1899), grandson of Henry Maudslay, Rev. Henry Moseley and Robert Napier for \"Class V. Machines for Direct Use, Including Carriages, Railway and Marine Mechanism.\" Condition 6. of the Exhibition's \"Decisions Regarding Juries\" restricted Jurors from competing for prizes in the Class to which they were appointed; prizes could not be awarded to the individual or the companies the Juror represented.\n\nIn 1855 Hick exhibited two pieces from his collection of art works: \"The Stag Hunt\" and \"Lady Jane Grey and Roger Ascham\" by John Callcott Horsley in the Fine Art Division of the Exposition Universelle (1855) alongside his father-in-law William Bashall who presented \"The Madrigal\", also by Horsley. Hick and Bashall used the same pair again for the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester with \"Cupid and Psyche\" by Benjamin West PRA and \"Crossing the Brook\" by Paul Falconer Poole.\n\nHick was a force behind the movement that led to the formation of the 27th Lancashire Rifle Volunteers from the Bolton area, he was offered command, but declined; The Regiment was formed on 15 November 1859 following tensions between the United Kingdom and France and the out break of war between France and the Austrian Empire during April of the same year. William Gray MP JP (1814–1895) and former Mayor of Bolton became Lieutenant Colonel 1 January 1861; John Hick's nephew Benjamin Hick (1845–1882), manager in Hick, Hargreaves & Co, was made a Captain 16 March 1872, resigning his commission about four years later 23 February 1876.\n\nIn 1860 partners in B. Hick and Son, John Hick and William Hargreaves joined Thomas Lever Rushton's brother-in-law Henry Sharp as partners in Sharp and Eckersley, formerly Rushton and Eckersley before Rushton's retirement from the firm in 1859. The three partners Sharp, Hick and Hargreaves formed the Bolton Iron & Steel Company; situated next door to Rothwell's Union Foundry (now Bolton bus station) the company supplied basic metals required by the major manufacturers in the area. Bessemer steel making began about 1860 – four six-ton Bessemer converters were installed during the 1860s, and experiments with the Sieman's open-hearth process began in 1867. Rolling, casting and forging equipment was installed, its products included steel deck beams for ships and sheet metal for shovels, during 1865 Bolton Iron & Steel cast the largest anvil block made in England, weighing 210 tons. By 1869 the company was making open hearth steel and manufacturing steam hammers to the design of Francis Webb. Hick's nephew became a shareholder following incorporation on 9 June 1876.\nAbout 1861 society painter Francis Grant produced portraits of John Hick and his wife Margaret, both works eventually hung together in the family home at Mytton Hall. Hick was an associate of Bolton engineer, artist and photographer Reuben Mitchell (1812–1895), and pursued his own interest in photography, he was also a supporter of the artists Copley Fielding, William Powell Frith, Patrick Nasmyth, Samuel Prout, Edward Matthew Ward and others; the engineer and artist James Nasmyth described John Hick as an \"excellent friend\".\n\nHick wrote a history of Timothy Hackworth's locomotive \"Sans Pareil\" and presented the restored engine to the Patent Office Museum (now the Science Museum) in 1864, he also photographed William M. Gowland for Bennett Woodcroft. Gowland was driver of Hackworth's \"Royal George\" and driver of \"Sans Pareil\" at the Rainhill Trials.\n\n\"Sans Pareil\" was previously owned by Hick's brother-in-law and eventual business partner John Hargreaves Jr (1800–1874) who had the engine fully repaired and running on the Bolton and Leigh Railway in 1837. \"Sans Pareil\" is now housed at the National Railway Museum's Shildon Locomotion Museum annexe.\n\nIn 1867 Hick first published a paper, reprinted from \"The Engineer\", 1 June 1866, \"Experiments on the Friction of the Leather Collars in Hydraulic Presses\", that expanded on the work of Dr William Rankine, describing an important series of experiments carried out using a joint invention of Hick and Robert Lüthy (1840–1883), a Swiss engineer employed by Hick, and inventor of a hydraulic cotton packing press. Hick's father was the inventor of the self tightening collar, used universally in hydraulic pressess.\n\nOn 17 November 1868 Hick was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolton. After election and to avoid a conflict of interest, he immediately resigned his position within Hick, Hargreaves and Co., the firm were already in possession of government contracts, and withdrew from the Bolton Iron and Steel Company. Hick held the seat until 24 March 1880 when as a result of ill-health, he chose not to stand for re-election.\n\nHick was a liberal Conservative in favour of education based on religion, a supporter of the general principles of the Education Act 1870 and an adherent to the view that religious and secular education should not be separated. As a Conservative he was a member of the Carlton, Conservative and St Stephen's Clubs.\n\nIn May 1870 Hick chaired a Select Committee to investigate steam-boiler explosions; following the report in August 1870, he introduced a Bill \"...to provide a more efficient remedy to persons injured and property damaged by the explosion of steam-boilers through negligence\". In April 1871 he seconded a motion by Colonel Barttelot (1820–1893), Conservative MP for Sussex Western 1860–1885, for a Select Committee \"...to inquire into the merits of the Martini-Henry Rifle...whether it is the most suitable rifle as compared with others now manufactured to arm our troops with.\" and debated \"Supply – Army Estimates\", June 1873 drawing attention to the improvement of heavy ordnance. As a parliamentarian he was frequently consulted by Government on subjects relating to armaments and the construction of boilers for war-vessels.\n\nHick also served on a Select Committee appointed June 1874 to investigate the testing of chain cable and anchors for the Navy, and debated \"Railway accidents – the adoption of continuous brakes\", June 1879. As a director of LNWR, Hick defended the railway's position, stating he \"regarded all automatic machinery with distrust\".\n\nHe was Deputy Lieutenant for the County Palatine from 1870 until death and on taking up residence at Mytton Hall, Justice of the Peace for Whalley, Lancashire, he rejoined the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 1871, proposed by Frederick Bramwell and elected a Member of Council in 1872, a Vice-President of the institute from 1874 to 1876.\nFor his contribution to the 1873 International Exhibition at South Kensington Hick was presented with a Bronze Medal, he was a member of the \"Permanent Committee for the Representation for British Pictures\" for the 1874 International Exhibition with fellow MPs Henry Bolckow, Alexander Brown, Henry Eaton, Joshua Fielden, William Graham, John Snowdon Henry, John Pender and others.\n\nOn 15 March 1879, towards the end of his time as an MP, John Hick along with C.D. Abel, Colonel Frederick Beaumont (1833–1899) Liberal MP for South Durham 1868–1880, F. Bolton, Alexander Brogden JP (1825–1892) of John Brogden and Sons, Liberal MP 1868–1885 for Wednesbury, J.T. Jones and J. Turay registered the Aqueous Works and Diamond Rock-boring Company (Limited), Crown Works, Guildford Street, York Road, Lambeth. The company \"...bought out and patented the system of using diamonds for boring\"., Hick was elected a member of the Iron and Steel Institute the same year. The Aqueous Works and Diamond Rock-boring Company was liquidated about 1892.\n\nAfter leaving parliament Hick and Lt-Col. Ralph John Aspinall JP, DL, campaigned against the pollution and poisoning of salmon and trout in the River Ribble and its tributories by local industry; Hick raised the issue of pollution in the Ribble during the third reading of the Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876. Aspinall and Hick fought a publicised and successful legal battle in the Court of Chancery against the cotton mills of Mitchell and Carlisle during July 1880 leading to a landmark judgement that set a precedent for controlling environmental pollution.\n\nThe river ran close to Mytton Hall where landlord Aspinall held the fishing rights and John Hick was lessee from 1874. The trial was presided over by the Vice-Chancellor of England, Sir James Bacon. In December 1880 Hick and Aspinall received presentations at Mytton Hall from the local angling community in recognition of \"...their services in preventing pollution to the River Ribble and its tributories\".\n\nDuring 1887 Hick was a member of the mechanical collections committee chaired by John Slagg, MP with other experts and politicians; Sir William Armstrong, Sir Joseph Bazelgette, James Brunlees, Edward Cowper, Professor T. M. Goodeve, Sir Charles Gregory, James Howard, MP, Charles Manby, John Hinde Palmer (d.1884), Sir Edward Reed, MP and Sir Bernhard Samuelson, MP established with several committees for the purpose of advising a central committee appointed by the Treasury to investigate the forming of a Science Museum and National Gallery of Portraits in South Kensington, situated between the Natural History Museum and what was to be the Imperial Institute.\n\nPreviously of Hill Top, Belmont, Lancashire Hick died at the age of 78 after some months of failing health when living at Mytton Hall, Whalley, Lancashire and Lezayre, Isle of Man, where he was also a Justice of the Peace.\n\nLike his father Benjamin, John Hick accumulated a large and valuable collection of art works, some of which was inherited, others purchased from the auction of Benjamin Hick's estate in 1843, and devoted his final years at Mytton Hall to compiling an elaborately illustrated catalogue of the collection; some of these works were auctioned by Christie's during June and July 1909 following Rebecca Hick's death in 1908. The Hick library at Mytton Hall was dispersed at Capes Dunne & Co. Manchester in November 1909.\n\nFrom the year of his death the London North Western Railway (LNWR) produced 10 steam locomotives of the \"John Hick\" Class (1894–1912); a Francis Webb design of 2-2-2-2 configuration, engine No. 20 named \"John Hick\". The following 9 engines were named after engineers and inventors, principally from the industrial and Second industrial revolution: No. 1505 \"Richard Arkwright\", No. 1512 \"Henry Cort\", No. 1534 \"William Froude\", No. 1535 \"Henry Maudslay\", No. 1536 \"Hugh Myddelton\", No. 1548 \"John Penn\", No. 1549 \"John Rennie\", No. 1557 \"Thomas Savery\" and No. 1559 \"William Siemens\".\n\nHick was unique in that he was the only LNWR director to have a locomotive class named after him \"in memoriam\".\n\nFollowing withdrawal of the \"John Hick\" Class in 1912, during the month of the anniversary of Hick's death, February 1913, 5 of 6 names were transferred to the LNWR \"George the Fifth\" Class, locomotive No. 752 named \"John Hick\", serving up to 1935 with the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS).\n\n\n"}

He, using the title \"Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtney, King of Jerusalem\", along with several of his followers, was killed in a confrontation with soldiers in Bossenden Wood, in what has sometimes been called the last battle to be fought on English soil.\n\nJohn Nichols Tom (or Thom) was born the son of innkeepers in 1799 at St Columb Major, Cornwall. He was baptised in the parish church on 10 November 1799. His parents were William and Charity Tom who kept the Joiners' Arms. Tom went to school in Penryn, attending Bellevue Academy (a \"Classical and Commercial Academy\"). At the age of about fourteen he transferred to the private school in Launceston that was run by Reverend Richard Cope, pastor of the local Congregational Church.\n\nTom stayed at school until he was eighteen and was then articled to solicitor Mr Paynter of St Columb. He decided, however, against a career in the law and left after three years. After a short spell as an innkeeper in Wadebridge he settled down as a clerk in the firm of Lubbock and Co, wine merchants of Truro, and took over the business when the partners retired, extending it to include malting. In 1821 he married Catherine Fisher Fulpitt, the daughter of a market gardener in Truro. Tom was a tall, strongly built, good-looking man, who became known in Truro for his skill as a cricketer. During a visit to London he joined the Spencean Society.\n\nWhen Tom was in his late twenties a series of disasters struck. His mother Charity was removed to Cornwall Lunatic Asylum in 1827, and died there. Then, in 1828, his business premises in Pydar Street burnt down. Tom claimed the insurance and was able to rebuild the premises. At the Quarter Sessions held at Bodmin on 15 July 1828, Tom applied successfully for the return of £304 paid in excise duty on malt destroyed in the fire at his malthouse on 17 June 1828. In 1831 Tom received treatment from a surgeon for an attack of insanity but recovered and the following spring sailed from Truro to Liverpool with a cargo of malt. He wrote to his wife from Liverpool to tell her he had sold the malt, and wrote again from Birmingham to tell her he was going to France. Nothing more was heard from him until over a year later, when his family heard that a man who fitted his description and went by the name of Sir William Courtenay was being held in Maidstone prison.\n\nIn September 1832 Thom arrived in Canterbury, dressed in exotic costumes and wearing long hair and a beard. He put up at the Rose Inn at the junction of Rose Lane and the main street and went first by the name of Count Rothschild, and then by the name of Sir William Percy Honeywood Courtenay, Knight of Malta, heir to the Earl of Devon and the Kentish estates of Sir Edward Hales.\n\nAlthough many people realized he was an imposter he nevertheless became a colourful and popular figure in the town, partly because he frequently made comical and insulting speeches directed at the unpopular mayor and magistrates of the city and the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the December 1832 general election Liberal support in the town was so strong that the Conservatives decided not to field candidates. Stung by jeers about not standing, some local Conservatives asked Tom to stand as an independent candidate for Canterbury, hoping he would inconvenience the Liberals. He polled a creditable 375 votes (against 834 for Richard Watson and 802 for Viscount Fordwich, the Liberal candidates). He then decided to stand in the East Kent election, but polled only three votes, and turned his attention to publishing a weekly paper, \"The Lion\". Eight issues of the paper were produced. Full of biblical quotations, it argued for the rights of the poor, expressed loyalty to the Crown, and was critical of the clergy, aristocracy, town corporations and Parliament. Tom's biographer described the views expressed in \"The Lion\" as showing \"amazing common sense... far in advance of those generally held in his time\", for example, regarding rents, taxation, the Irish problem, and corporal punishment, although these \"occasional shafts of light\" were surrounded by \"turgid nonsense\".\n\nAt the beginning of March 1833, Thom intervened in the case of some Faversham smugglers, acting as a witness for the defence. The smugglers were nevertheless convicted, and Tom was prosecuted for perjury. His trial took place on 25 July at the Kent Summer Assizes at Maidstone before Mr Justice Parke and a crowded court. Evidence was heard from the Vicar of Boughton-under-Blean that Tom had been at church when he claimed to have witnessed events off the Goodwin Sands. In spite of the testimony of a number of character witnesses, the jury returned a verdict of guilty and Tom was sentenced to three months imprisonment and seven years transportation to Australia.\n\nTom's family in Truro had heard about the trial and Catherine Tom arrived in Maidstone in August to see if Courtenay was her missing husband. He was produced by the governor of Maidstone Gaol and she made a positive identification. Although Tom always denied any connection with the Truro family, Catherine Tom was believed. She told the authorities about her husband's previous attack of insanity; he was then examined by two surgeons who declared him of unsound mind. Tom was transferred to Barming Heath Asylum on 28 October 1833.\n\nTom was a model patient in the asylum and in 1837 the superintendent suggested to his wife that she should petition the home secretary for his release. Tom's father in Truro brought his son's case to the attention of Sir Hussey Vivian, the Liberal candidate for East Cornwall in the August 1837 election. Vivian, after his election, took the matter up with the home secretary, Lord John Russell, and Tom was granted a free pardon by Queen Victoria, on condition he was returned into the care of his family in Cornwall. Thom was still refusing to acknowledge the Cornish family and, instead of returning to Cornwall, went to live with a local farmer and supporter, Mr Francis of Fairbrook, Boughton-under-Blean, who had offered to be his guardian. This was permitted, due to some ambiguous wording on the pardon, and in October 1837, four years after his admission to the asylum, Tom was released.\n\nBy January 1838, Tom had fallen out with Mr Francis, and he spent the next few months riding through East Kent, relying on the hospitality of supporters. With promises of a better future, fairer distribution of wealth and greater equality, he attracted a following of agricultural labourers, artisans and small-holders. In particular, he addressed their concerns about low wages, lack of work, and the New Poor Law, which ordered all able-bodied men to workhouses if they could not find work. Until the end of May, the activities of Tom and his small band of followers were entirely peaceful as they marched around the local countryside trying to drum up support amongst the workers. Some wealthier landowners were however becoming alarmed and, on 31 May 1838, a local magistrate, Dr Poore, issued a warrant for Tom's arrest for inciting workmen to leave their work.\n\nEarly on the morning of 31 May, the parish constable of Boughton-under-Blean enlisted the help of his assistant and also of his brother, Nicholas Mears, and set off to find Tom. When they arrived at Bossenden Farm, where Tom and his followers were staying, Tom shot and killed Nicholas Mears. The constable and his assistant fled. News of the murder reached the magistrates and soldiers were called out from the barracks at Canterbury. A detachment of the 45th Infantry under Major Armstrong, with three junior officers and about one hundred men, met up with the magistrates and tracked Tom and his followers down to a clearing in Bossenden Wood. Tom's followers numbered between thirty and forty (a few having managed to escape after the killing of the constable), and, with the exception of Tom and one other who had pistols, were armed only with sticks. As the soldiers advanced, Lieutenant Bennet was shot dead by Tom. In the ensuing confrontation, which lasted only a few minutes, Tom and eight of his followers were killed or mortally wounded by the soldiers, and a young special constable who was helping the soldiers was caught in their fire and killed. One soldier was slightly injured by a stick.\n\nTom's body, together with those of his followers who had been killed, was taken to the Red Lion Inn at Dunkirk. The inn was besieged by souvenir and relic hunters, and the simply curious. The landlord of Red Lion claimed 20,000 people had visited the neighbourhood over the next few days. Tom's biographer describes public feeling:\n\n\"This was an insignificant casualty list as battles go; but it was a terrible price to pay for the capture, dead, of one man. When the disastrous results of the affray became known, public opinion was deeply shocked at what seemed an unnecessary loss of life. The repercussions of the Battle of Bossenden wood were soon, in fact, to reach Westminster itself.\"\n\nAn inquest was held at the White Horse, Boughton, the Saturday after the battle, with the jury returning a verdict of \"justifiable homicide\" on the deaths of Tom and his followers. On the following Tuesday Tom was buried in Hernhill cemetery.\n\nFew of Tom's followers had been arrested at the scene of the battle, but some were picked up over the next few days. Thirty men and two women were arrested, and of these ten were tried for murder - two for the murder of the constable's brother and nine for the murder of Bennett (with Thomas Mears being charged with both). Thomas Mears and William Price were convicted of the murder of the constable's brother, then the rest pleaded guilty. Thomas Mears and William Wills were transported for life, William Price for ten years, and the others received one year's imprisonment.\n\nLocal magistrates and politicians, especially Lord John Russell, were attacked for their role in the affair. There were accusations that Sir Hussey Vivian had requested Tom's release in return for his father's vote. A parliamentary select committee was appointed and sat for three days in June. Barrister Frederick Liardet was sent to survey the area for the Central Society of Education, and a school and a church were built in Dunkirk. Journalists talked of the ignorance and moral degradation of the area. Feargus O'Connor suggested a monument should be erected in memory of Courtenay's followers.\n\n\n\n"}

Asprey\n\nLarned (Larry) Brown Asprey (March 19, 1919 – March 6, 2005) was an American chemist noted for his work on actinide, lanthanide, rare-earth, and fluorine chemistry, and for his contributions to nuclear chemistry on the Manhattan Project and later at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\nAsprey was born in Sioux City, Iowa, on March 19, 1919, the son of Gladys Brown Asprey and Peter Asprey Jr.\nHe had an older sister and a younger brother: mathematician and computer scientist Winifred Asprey, founder of Vassar College's computer science department,\nand military historian and writer Robert B. Asprey.\n\nAsprey received a B.S. in chemical technology at Iowa State University in 1940, after which he took a job as an industrial chemist with the Campbell Soup Company in Chicago. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1941, and posted to Fort Warren, Wyoming. He applied for and was accepted into the Army Specialized Training Program, which allowed soldiers to continue their education for a time, and went to Ohio State University to continue his chemistry studies. In January 1944, he was assigned to the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment, with the rank of technician third grade.\n\nAsprey was posted to the Metallurgical Laboratory (Met Lab) at the University of Chicago, where he joined the effort under Glenn T. Seaborg to devise techniques to separate and purify plutonium. There, with Herbert H. Anderson, he developed the PUREX process (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction); their patent \"Solvent Extraction Process for Plutonium\" was filed in 1947. He was among the atomic-bomb scientists who signed the Szilárd petition in July 1945 to ask U.S. President Harry S. Truman to exercise extreme care in any decision to use the atomic bomb in the war.\n\nIn 1945, Asprey and Winston Manning measured the half-life of the synthetic isotope 95 at about 16 hours; the transient isotope was made by irradiating an early sample of the as-yet-unnamed relatively stable 95 with neutrons. The product after beta decay was yet another new element, 96. These new unnamed elements created in the Met Lab in Chicago were announced to the world by Glenn Seaborg on November 11, 1945, on the radio show \"Quiz Kids\". Elements 95 and 96, originally called \"pandemonium\" and \"delirium\", were eventually named americium and curium by analogy with the chemically related elements europium and gadolinium. Asprey's later discovery, with S. E. Stephanou and Robert A. Penneman at Los Alamos, of the hexapositive, fluoride-soluble oxidation state of americium was one of the keys to the subsequent discovery of element 97, berkelium, at Berkeley, California, in 1949.\n\nWhile working in Chicago, he met his future wife Margaret (Marge) Williams, who also worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory. They were married at her parents' house in Chicago on May 3, 1944; the Catholic Church did not permit them to marry in a Church, because he was an atheist. They eventually had seven children: Peter Larned, twins Elizabeth (Betty) and Barbara (Barb), Robert Russell (Bobby), Margaret Susan (Peggy), Thomas Arthur (Tom), and William John (Bill). Marge had seven sisters (including one who died in early childhood), and brother Grant R. Williams who died as a Navy test pilot.\n\nAsprey was discharged from the Army in February 1946. He decided to enter the University of California, Berkeley, and get his Ph.D. in chemistry under the supervision of Burris B. Cunningham, whom he had worked for at the Metallurgical Laboratory. He wrote his thesis on \"Equilibria in the oxide systems of praseodymium and americium\", They moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1949, to work for the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he spent the rest of his career. He retired in 1986 after conducting more than thirty-five years of research on actinides and lanthanides and related chemistry. He published over 150 peer reviewed papers and held eight patents. He was the third awardee of the American Chemical Society's Glenn T. Seaborg Actinide Separations Award, in 1986. His wife Marge also worked at Los Alamos, and was recognized for her work by the American Nuclear Society with the Walter H. Zinn Award in 2005, shortly after his death on March 6, 2005, in Mesilla Park, New Mexico.\n"}

He began his education at \"Academia Mihăileană\", but completed high school in Berlin, where he was sent with his brother Iacob in 1853. He wanted to study medicine at Berlin University, but was too revolted by the anatomical dissections, and switched to philosophy and law. He attended lectures at Berlin and Vienna, but did not graduate. He returned home in 1864, where he was named a judge at the Iași tribunal. He gradually advanced to become a member of the appeals court as well as general prosecutor. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Prefect of Iași County under the Lascăr Catargiu government (1871-1876), resuming this office in March 1888. He also served as mayor of Iași, as deputy and as senator. Near the end of his life, he was administrator of Sfântul Spiridon Hospital.

{"id": "298124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298124", "title": "Lin Yutang", "text": "Lin Yutang\n\nLin Yutang (; October 10, 1895 – March 26, 1976) was a Chinese writer, translator, linguist, philosopher and inventor. His informal but polished style in both Chinese and English made him one of the most influential writers of his generation, and his compilations and translations of classic Chinese texts into English were bestsellers in the West.\n\nLin was born in 1895 in the town of Banzai, Pinghe, Zhangzhou, Fujian. The mountainous region made a deep impression on his consciousness, and thereafter, he would constantly consider himself a child of the mountains (in one of his books he commented that his idea of hell was a city apartment).\n\nHis father was a Christian minister. His journey of faith from Christianity to Taoism and Buddhism, and back to Christianity in his later life was recorded in his book \"From Pagan to Christian\" (1959).\n\nLin studied for his bachelor's degree at Saint John's University in Shanghai, then received a half-scholarship to continue study for a doctoral degree at Harvard University. He later wrote that in the Widener Library he first found himself and first came alive, but he never saw a Harvard-Yale game. He left Harvard early, since he couldn't afford to study in Harvard anymore,and moved to work with the Chinese Labor Corps in France and eventually to Germany, where he completed his requirements for a doctoral degree in Chinese philology at the University of Leipzig. From 1923 to 1926 he taught English literature at Peking University.\n\nEnthusiastic about the success of the Northern Expedition, he briefly served in the new Nationalist government, but soon turned to teaching and writing. He found himself in the wake of the New Culture Movement which criticized China's tradition as feudal and harmful. Instead of accepting this charge, however, Lin immersed himself in the Confucian texts and literary culture which his Christian upbringing and English language education had denied him.\n\nHis humor magazine, \"Lunyu banyuekan\" (The Analects Fortnightly, 1932-40, 1945-49) featured essays by prominent writers such as Hu Shi, Lao She, Lu Xun, and Zhou Zuoren and attracted a wide readership. He was a key figure in introducing the Western concept of humor, which he felt China had lacked. Lin coined the term \"youmo\" (humor) in 1924 and used The Analects to promote his conception of humor as the expression of a tolerant, cosmopolitan, understanding and civilized philosophy of life. In 1933, Lu Xun attacked the \"Analects\" for being apolitical and dismissed Lin's elegant xiaopin wen 小品文, or small essays, as \"bric a brac for the bourgeoisie.\" Lu Xun nevertheless maintained a cordial relationship with Lin and continued to contribute to his journal.\n\nLin's writings in Chinese were critical of the Nationalist government to the point that he feared for his life. Many of his essays from this time were later collected in \"With Love and Irony\" (1940). In 1933, he met Pearl Buck in Shanghai, who introduced him and his writings to her publisher, Richard Walsh, head of John Day publishers, who published Lin's works for many years.\n\nLin's relation with Christianity changed over the years. His father, of course, was a second-generation Christian, but at Tsinghua, Lin asked himself what it meant to be a Christian in China. Being a Christian meant acceptance of Western science and progress, but Lin became angry that being a Christian also meant losing touch with China's culture and his own personal identity.\n\nOn his return from study abroad, Lin renewed his respect for his father, yet he plunged into study of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism and did not identify himself as Christian until the late 1950s.\n\nAfter 1935, Lin lived mainly in the United States, where he became known as a \"wise and witty\" popularizer of Chinese philosophy and way of life. Lin's first best sellers were \"My Country and My People\" () (1935) and \"The Importance of Living\" () (1937), written in English in a charming style. Others include \"Between Tears and Laughter\" () (1943), \"The Importance of Understanding\" (1960, a book of translated Chinese literary passages and short pieces), \"The Chinese Theory of Art\" (1967). The novels \"Moment in Peking\" (1939), \"A Leaf in the Storm\" (1940), and \"The Vermilion Gate\" () (1953) were well received epics of China in turmoil while \"Chinatown Family\" (1948) presented the lives of Chinese Americans in New York. Partly to avoid controversial contemporary issues, Lin in 1947 published \"The Gay Genius: The Life and Times of Su Tungpo\", which presented the struggle between Su Dongpo and Wang Anshi as parallel to the struggle between Chinese liberals and totalitarian communists.\n\nLin's political writings in English sold fewer copies than his cultural works and were more controversial. \"Between Tears and Laughter\" (1943) broke with the genial tone of his earlier English writings to criticize Western racism and imperialism.\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, Lin traveled in China and wrote favorably of the war effort and Chiang Kai-shek in \"Vigil of a Nation\" (1944). American China Hands such as Edgar Snow criticized the works.\n\nMechanics had been a long time avocation. Since Chinese is a character-based rather than an alphabet-based language, with many thousands of separate characters, it was difficult to employ modern printing technologies. Many doubted that a Chinese typewriter could be invented. Lin, however, worked on this problem for decades and eventually came up with a workable typewriter, brought to market in the middle of the war with Japan.\n\nThe Mingkwai \"Clear and Quick\" Chinese-language typewriter played a pivotal role in the Cold War machine translation research. Lin also invented and patented several lesser inventions, such as a toothbrush that dispensed toothpaste.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, he served briefly and unhappily as president (or chancellor) of the Nanyang University, which was newly created in Singapore specifically for Chinese studies as parallel to the English-oriented University of Singapore. He did not, however, choose to continue in that role when the faculty resisted his plans to demolish and rebuild the new school building (which though grand, was not \"Western\" enough), his demands to have sole control over finances, and a budget clearly beyond its means. Lin accepted a dismissal fee of $305,203, entirely contributed by Tan Lark Sye, to prevent depleting the university's funds.\n\nHe would later claim that Nanyang (South Seas) University became a focus of the struggle for control of Singapore between the Communist-directed left and the liberal, social democratic right and that he was too old for the conflict. The episode left a bad taste in the Malayan Chinese community, who felt betrayed by his actions during and after the fiasco.\n\nAfter he returned to New York in the late 1950s, Lin renewed his interest in Christianity. His wife was a devout believer, and Lin admired her serenity and humility. After attending services with her at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church for several months, he joined the church and announced his return to the faith. His 1959 book \"From Pagan to Christian\" explained this move, which many of his readers found surprising.\n\nWith his facility for both Chinese and English idiom, Lin presided over the compilation of a Chinese-English dictionary, \"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" (1972), which contains a massive English index to definitions of Chinese terms. The work was undertaken at the newly founded Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nHis many works represent an attempt to bridge the cultural gap between the East and the West. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1940 and 1950.\n\nHe continued to live up his work until his death in 1976. Lin was buried at his home in Yangmingshan, Taipei, Taiwan. His home has been turned into a museum, which is operated by Taipei-based Soochow University. The town of Lin's birth, Banzai, has also preserved the original Lin home and turned it into a museum.\n\nAlthough his major books have remained in print, Lin is a thinker whose place in modern Chinese intellectual history has been overlooked until recently. Lin themed conventions have been organized in Taiwan and Lin's native Fujian, and in December 2011, the International Conference on the Cross-cultural Legacy of Lin Yutang in China and America was held at City University of Hong Kong, with professional and private scholars from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, the United States, Germany and Slovakia. The organizer of the conference was Dr. Qian Suoqiao, author of the book, \"Liberal Cosmopolitan: Lin Yutang and Middling Chinese Modernity\" (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2010).\n\nThe first full-length academic study of Lin in English is Diran John Sohigian's \"The Life and Times of Lin Yutang\" (Columbia University Ph.D. diss., 1991). Jing Tsu's Sound and Script in Chinese Diaspora (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2010) gives a detailed account of Lin Yutang's typewriter and its role in the context of late 19th century script reform, Chinese national language reform in the early twentieth century and the fascinating story of his typewriting keyboard and machine translation research during the Cold War.\n\nHis wife, Liao Tsui-feng (廖翠鳳), was an author, who, along with her daughter Lin Hsiang Ju, wrote three cookery books which popularized Chinese cuisine in the English speaking world. Dr. Lin wrote introductions which explained the historical background and relevance for American life.\n\nHis first daughter Lin Feng-ju (林鳳如; 1923–1971), known as Adet, was an author who also used the pseudonym Tan Yun.\n\nHis second daughter Lin Taiyi (林太乙; 1926–2003) was also known as Anor Lin in her earliest writing, and had the Chinese name Yu-ju 玉如. She was an author and the general editor of Chinese Reader's Digest from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. She also wrote a biography of her father in Chinese (林語堂傳), which shows some signs of her father's literary flair.\n\nHis third daughter Lin Hsiang-ju (林相如; born 1931), was referred to as MeiMei in childhood. She was co-author of cookbooks with her mother, and was a biochemist at Queen Mary hospital in Hong Kong.\n\nThe daughters all had names containing the character 如 (Ju): Adet 鳳如, Anor 玉如, and HsiangJu 相如.\n\nWorks by Lin in Chinese or published in China to 1935 include:\n\n\nWorks by Lin in English include:\n\n\n\n"}

It hangs in the Abbey Church in Nykøbing on the Danish island of Falster.\n\nQueen Sophie's genealogical table was the work of Antonius Clement from Odense. It was donated by the queen to Nykøbing's Abbey Church. Evert Decker, Clement's closest pupil, began the work in 1622, receiving a partial fee of 500 courant daler in 1624. The table, however, was not completed until 1626 when Frantz Kraeg received payment for the upper sections, one of which bears the date of fitting, 1627.\n\nThe table consists of boards of oak (top sections in pine) which are arranged into two halves. Its surface, covering is painted with oils on a chalk base. It shows Queen Sophie (in the centre below the two halves) with five generations of her ancestors, 63 in all, with half-length portraits, coats-of-arms and name plates. Each row covers a generation with the queen's paternal relatives on the right and the maternal ancestors on the left.\n\nThe value of the images as portraits is however limited to the closest family members, especially those of the queen dowager herself and her parents, which are considered reliable portrayals. By contrast, those of the older generations are imaginative works, often wearing equally imaginative clothing. Inscriptions are in gilded capitals on a dark background. The frame is in the Auricular style with putti and angels. On the cornice below, there are small female figures representing the virtues. Both the upper sections are crowned with angels, one blowing a bassoon, the other waving a palm branch. The German inscription at the top states (in summary):\n\nThe table has been restored on several occasions, most recently in 1943 by N. H. Termansen. Cracks were repaired and the original base tone was revealed after being completely covered over during an earlier restoration, probably that of 1874. The table hangs on the church's north wall, on a U-shaped iron support. \n\n"}

He studied literature at Damascus University and in 1919 began to work for the Ministry of Education. In the same year, be began writing for the newspapers \"al-Ayyam\" (Damascus) and \"al-Hayat\" (Beirut). Munir opposed the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon imposed in 1920 and in 1925 left his job to join the revolt of Sultan al-Atrash. At the end of the revolt, in 1927, Rayyes returned to Damascus, where he was a regular writer for \"al-Hayyat\". In August 1933 Rayyes became a founder member of the League of Nationalist Action, whose goal was to remove foreign political influence in the region. With the fading of the League in 1935, Rayyes moved to Palestine from 1936-38 to join Haj Amin al-Husseini in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine. In 1938 he became the director of political affairs at the Damascus police department.\n\nIn 1945, Munir founded a newspaper, \"Barada\", working as its editor-in-chief, and another in support of Husni al-Za'im's 1949 coup, called \"al-Inkilab\" (\"The Coup d'Etat\"). His journalism included campaigning for women's emancipation (including giving his wife, Thuraya Al-Hafez, a platform; he also encouraged her to stand for election in 1953). On August 25, 1952, Barada merged with the Damascus daily paper \"al-Manar al-Jadid\" on the orders of Adib Shishakli, becoming \"al-Liwaa\". The owner of \"al-Manar al-Jadid\", Bashir al-Ouff, became editor-in-chief of the new paper, and Rayyes the director, until in 1954 the papers were split again. 1954 also saw a short-lived experiment with running a shareholding company to print Syria's four main papers, \"al-Qabas\", \"al-Ayyam\", \"Alif Ba'\", and \"al-Sham\". Rayyes supported Arab nationalist movements in the 1950s and Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt both during and after the United Arab Republic. Rayyes supported the 1963 Syrian coup d'état but once their power was established, the Baath party closed \"Barada\".\n\nRayyes is also noted for his book \"Al-Kitāb al-Dhahabī li'l-Thawrāt al-Waṭaniyya fī al-Mashriq al-ʿArabī: al-Thawra al-Sūriyya al-Kubrā\" (\"The Golden Book of Nationalist Revolutions in the Arab East\").\n\nSami M.

{"id": "4244015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4244015", "title": "Richard Rossi", "text": "Richard Rossi\n\nRichard Rossi (born March 2, 1963) is an American filmmaker, actor, writer, talk radio host, and former evangelical minister. In 1995 Rossi went on trial for the attempted murder of his wife. She recanted her original identification of Rossi as her attacker and espoused his innocence. The case ended in a mistrial and was front-page news in Rossi's adopted hometown of Pittsburgh and was widely covered by syndicated television news programs.\nRossi eventually was acquitted of attempted murder but pleaded no contest to aggravated assault.\n\nRossi's father was a professional jazz guitarist in West View, Pennsylvania; the son followed in his father's footsteps, playing the guitar on stage at age 7. \n\nAs a child, Rossi was fascinated with Pittsburgh-based faith healer Kathryn Kuhlman. After one of his father's hospitalizations for manic depression, Rossi landed in a surrogate family led by an evangelist who immersed him in Pentecostal preaching and outreach. After a drug overdose, he became a\nborn-again Christian and toured as a rock and roll preacher, usually in tandem with songwriting partner Johnny Walker, playing gospel rock. Rossi and his songwriting partner Walker were featured on \"The 700 Club\".\n\nRossi moved to Lynchburg, Virginia at age 18 to study at Liberty University, where he earned a bachelor's and master's degree in biblical studies.\n\nHis second church, created informally with ministry partner Jack Sims, was called \"Matthew's Party,\" the name taken from the biblical story about Jesus eating with tax collectors and sinners at the home of Matthew, the gospel writer. In 1986, Rossi started First Love, a charismatic church. He rented movie theaters and showed films as an evangelistic outreach. Dramatic faith healings allegedly occurred. The healing services, called \"Healing Clinics,\" grew from 200 to 2000. Rossi filmed the healings and co-produced a Fox TV documentary on faith healing and exorcism in 1992 entitled \"Quest for Truth\". The program first aired during the fall season on WPGH-TV 53 and WPTT-TV 22.\n\nIn 1988, Rossi tried and failed to change both the name of the Church of the Three Rivers and its affiliation. He then joined the Assemblies of God the next year and led the Cranberry church, but left in 1991, saying that his ministry was too radical for the Assemblies; church officials said he left owing several thousand dollars for the church building.\n\nIn September 1991, Rossi began broadcasting his nightly radio show \"Rich Rossi Live\" on Pittsburgh's WPIT-FM. The program created controversy when Rossi called other evangelical churches \"whores\" who sell out the gospel for money. Rossi appeared on the Jerry Springer Show in 1994 to discuss faith healing, exorcism, and ESP.\n\nOn June 24, 1994, Rossi's wife, Sherrie Lynn, was found near death in a coma on the side of a Pennsylvania road. She had a crushed skull and was left covered in blood; her injuries were so severe that she needed to wear a helmet. Her rescuers thought she had been in a traffic accident, and called for an ambulance. Ninety minutes later, at 8:05 pm, Richard Rossi called police, and claimed that men killed his wife and shot at him twice. But when police came to interview him, his story changed, first claiming that a man that looked like him got into the passenger side of the car, then that the man who looked like him attacked from the driver's side. Rossi had a cellular phone available, but said he pursued the assailant instead of dialing for help because he was a \"good runner.\" Rossi also changed his story on where the assailants approached from, first saying they were in a white car, then that they \"came out of the woods out of nowhere.\" Police testified that Rossi told them a \"satanic cult\" was trying to frame him; Rossi denies this. Rossi was wearing only a pair of tan shorts when police interviewed him; Rossi claimed that he lost his shirt running through the woods, but did not explain why he was barefoot. Several witnesses reported seeing a man with long hair near the Rossi's cars, and State Police reports suggested the presence of two other cars, one blue and one white.\n\nMs. Rossi twice testified that her husband attacked her and left her for dead. Sherrie Lynn received an order of protection from a court. But in October 1994, Sherrie withdrew her accusation; a state court judge refused her request to void the order of protection. (Press accounts claimed that Ms. Rossi stated that her attacker might have been a demon in human form, but the Rossis deny she said this.) Sherrie's stepbrother, Mark Plaugher, accused the Rossi family of pressuring her to change her story; her father said she had been \"brainwashed,\" and Sherrie's stepfather, Phil Plaugher, said that church members pressured Sherrie by telling her that it was a sin to testify against one's husband.\n\nSherrie Rossi testified in the trial that her attacker was a different man with brown eyes and that Rossi's eyes are blue. She said her earlier testimony against Rossi was coerced by police when she was still recovering and did not have a complete recollection, and that her second testimony exonerating her husband came from \"flashbacks\" and a \"fuller complete recollection\" of what occurred. Sherrie Rossi said: \"We have eyewitnesses who saw a white car similar to ours following us and several family members several weeks before I was attacked. My husband also received a number of threats before I was attacked.\" Over Rossi's wife's objections, prosecutors charged him with attempted murder and won a court ruling admitting her earlier testimony at trial. The parties argued whether the blood-soaked interior of Rossi's car was consistent with Sherrie's claim. The secretary of Rossi's church testified that Rossi asked him shortly after the incident to forge an alibi. The defense called two witnesses, a church member and Rossi's mother, for a total of a half-hour of testimony; Rossi himself did not testify.\n\nA five-day trial ended in a hung jury, with the vote 9–3 in favor of conviction after six and a half hours of deliberation. Before retrial, Rossi pleaded no contest to a count of second-degree aggravated assault while maintaining his innocence. Though his followers wanted him to fight what his wife called an \"assault of justice,\" Rossi stated he pled nolo contendre to end the ordeal. \"One of my many goals is to heal our family and become the best husband and father I can be,\" Rossi said to the judge. He received a four-to-eight-month sentence in Butler County Jail plus four years probation and required domestic violence counseling; he served 96 days.\nDomestic violence workers criticized the short sentence. The Rossis renewed their wedding vows after his release. Rossi wrote an apologetic letter to the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" saying: \"I repent of the sins I have committed and, with God's help, do not plan to repeat them.\"\n\nSherrie Rossi, who had campaigned for her husband's exoneration, sued state and county officials for abridging her civil rights when courts refused to lift a bond restriction forbidding her husband to contact her while he was out on bail; the suit was dismissed by a federal court. In 1996, Sherrie self-published \"Assault of Justice: The Richard Rossi Mystery\", defending her husband and proclaiming his innocence, and claiming that charges were retaliation for exposing police corruption and a satanic cult on his talk radio show. She said eyewitnesses confirmed her husband's innocence and that they had been receiving threats prior to the assault. An unsupported press release asserted Rossi was innocent (based on physical evidence and the testimony of eyewitnesses).\n\nWhile charges were pending and Rossi served his sentence, membership in his church dropped from 300 to 12. Media scrutiny of his trials and tribulations revealed Rossi suffered mental health, depression, and addiction issues similar to his father's. Rossi enrolled in a recovery program in jail that he continued after his release, including meetings four days a week, daily monitoring, and treatment in Atlanta.\n\nAfter his release from jail, Rossi and his wife hosted a free Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless at the Ranch House in Pittsburgh's North Park. Rossi paid for buses to transport urban children out of high-crime areas to the park. Most of the buses got to those wanting to come, but one had difficulty getting to the arranged pick-up due to snow. Native Americans danced and helped Rossi serve dinners to disadvantaged children. Some of his fellow inmates Rossi befriended in jail attended to help serve the poor.\n\nAfter completing his probation, Rossi relocated to Hollywood with his wife and two children in 1997. He returned to preaching, serving as a pastor and church consultant, and moved into acting and filmmaking to explore his interest in creative and cutting-edge expressions of ministry.\n\nHis tenure as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church was interrupted when parishioners discovered his attempted murder charges and alleged that he had misused church money; litigation ensued, and the parties settled out of court.\nRossi's first Hollywood role was in the 1998 short film \"Jesus 2000\". In 1998, he appeared on stage in his own adaptation of \"Elmer Gantry\", which he wrote, produced and starred. His stage performance resulted in an offer to Rossi to play the role in a new film version.\n\nHe started \"Eternal Grace\", a movement of Hollywood house churches for actors and celebrities who had difficulty attending public services due to paparazzi, and also for AIDS victims and others not welcome to attend other churches. He was protested by followers of Fred Phelps from Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, who decried his lenient attitude toward homosexuals. Rossi's wife Sherrie worked with puppets in their children's ministry.\n\nIn 2001, Rossi wrote and directed \"Saving Sister Aimee\", a short documentary film about 1920s evangelist Aimee McPherson. Though some considered it a sensationalized depiction, it won the Angel Award from the Southern California Motion Picture Council for best documentary.\n\nIn 2005, Rossi revisited Sister Aimee's story in the low-budget feature biographical film \"\", (aka \"Aimee Semple McPherson\"), featuring Mimi Michaels in the lead and Rance Howard as the preacher's father. It was voted one of the greatest guerrilla films of all time, and attracted a record crowd to Hollywood's New Beverly Cinema, a revival house specializing in independent and cult films owned by Quentin Tarantino. A group of Evangelicals offered to invest $2 million in the film, but with conditions that the movie did not depict McPherson's divorce or drug overdose and that the actor playing the lead be a Pentecostal Christian. Rossi turned them down. \"By saying no to conditions that religious people put on me, I feel I'm actually of more service to God and people because I make an honest film,\" he said. In addition to his film work, Rossi acted on stage in plays and musicals to positive reviews, remaining active in the Los Angeles theater community.\n\nBetween acting jobs that included small roles on TV shows, among them \"The King of Queens\", \"Ally McBeal\", \"The X-Files\", \"Gilmore Girls\" and several movies, Rossi finished his first novel, \"Stick Man\", about a boy growing up in a bohemian household, with an accompanying musical soundtrack, and began working on \"\", a film about his childhood hero, baseball great Roberto Clemente, planning a \"bicoastal\" return to Pittsburgh to premiere his film on Roberto Clemente's birthday, August 18, 2013 before exhibiting the film in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, other cities, small art theaters, Roberto Clemente High School in Chicago, the Wild Goose Festival in North Carolina, and on DVD. The feature film was a labor of love for Rossi and the cadre of actors and technicians who volunteered their time and donated their services to the project. Olympian Jamie Nieto starred as Roberto Clemente. Rossi's telling of Clemente's story of commitment, loyalty, and devotion attempts to provide a counterpoint to today's baseball culture of players suspected of steroid abuse. The dramatic fulcrum of \"Baseball's Last Hero\" is a conversation Clemente has with a nun. \"She talks to him about the cross. 'Greater love has no man than to lay down his life for his friends,' is what the nun quotes to him from Scripture, talking about sacrificial love and Christ's sacrificial love,\" Rossi said. \"This is the theme I wanted to point out – an allegory of Christ on the cross.\" Rossi was pressured to delete the scene from the movie for being \"too preachy and too Catholic.\"\n\nThe controversial scene turned out to be one of the most popular scenes in the film and won over fans to the idea of pitching the Pope for Clemente's canonization as a saint. Rossi, a former evangelical minister, received several messages of support, including a letter showing papal support from Pope Francis in starting the process from the Vatican through the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C. and from Archbishop José Horacio Gómez of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. \"I've never thought of him in terms of being a saint\", said MLB second baseman Neil Walker, a devout Catholic whose father knew Clemente. \"But he's somebody who lived his life serving others, really. So if it would happen, I wouldn't be terribly surprised by it.\" \n\nSome claim the canonization church requirement of a miracle was met on July 22, 2017, when Jaime Nieto, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a backflip accident three years after the Clemente film was released, walked 130 steps at his own wedding to fellow Olympian Shevon Stoddart. The miracle was predicted by Rossi as a demonstration of the power of God in a letter he wrote to Pope Francis. Skeptics say Nieto's walking was improbable, but not miraculous, and was a result of Nieto's hard work and determination. The cause was also delayed according to some reports because the Archbishop of Puerto Rico was less passionate about Clemente's canonization than Pope Francis, and Vatican officials needing more time to investigate the miraculous claims.\n\nOn November 28, 2014, Rossi was in the news again regarding the controversy over the shooting of Michael Brown. Rossi wrote and recorded a protest song expressing his feelings about a grand jury's decision not to charge a white police officer in the death of the unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri. \"I wrote the song in five minutes as a way to express my emotions about the danger of trigger-happy police,\" Rossi said. \"I filmed it on my laptop at my kitchen table and uploaded it to YouTube.\" Rossi uploaded the video on November 26, and provided the song's lyrics in the video description. Here is a sample from the song's beginning, printed in the \"Los Angeles Daily News\": \"Down at the courthouse on a Monday afternoon/Justice was thrown right out the window when a young white cop entered the room.\"\n\nRossi continues to host his radio talk-show \"Richard Rossi Live\" as a podcast on BlogTalkRadio. In 2015, the format of the program changed from its Christian roots on WPIT, a Salem Radio Network station, by broadening its content for a general audience. Although Rossi still on occasion discusses religion, the program's focus is on known artists, writers, and celebrity guests.\n\nFollowing the positive Pittsburgh reception to Rossi's Roberto Clemente project, Rossi said enough time had passed for him and his wife to forgive the media in his hometown for writing untruths about them. Rossi said they were finally coming home, living \"bicoastal,\" maintaining homes in Hollywood and Pittsburgh. \"We'd like to spend more time in our home, where most of our family and friends live, in the North Hills of Pittsburgh,\" Rossi said.\n\nIn March, 2016, it was reported that Rossi is in pre-production on his new film \"Canaan Land\". On October 17, 2016, it was announced that Claudia Wells, an actress who starred in the 1985 film \"Back to the Future\" was cast in the lead role of Sister Sara Sunday. However, as controversy regarding the film grew, the following month the actress \"no longer wants her name associated with the controversy,\" according to a casting associate.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, Rossi announced that Rebecca Holden, known from \"Knight Rider\" (1982 TV series), was cast in the lead role of Sister Sara Sunday.\n\nOn September 30, 2017, CBS KCAL9 news reported on Rossi's founding of the support group \"Families Fighting Fentanyl\" to combat the fentanyl epidemic, to help addicts, work with law enforcement to hold drug dealers accountable, and support grieving families who lost a loved one to fentanyl. Rossi discussed the 2017 death of his youngest brother due to an overdose of heroin laced with fentanyl. On January 31, 2018, Rossi and his family, in tandem with Pittsburgh Police, offered a cash reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual(s) who gave his brother the fatal fentanyl dose.\n"}

{"id": "322831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=322831", "title": "Romanians", "text": "Romanians\n\nThe Romanians ( or—historically, but now a seldom-used regionalism—\"rumâni\"; dated exonym: \"Vlachs\") are a Romance ethnic group and nation native to Romania, that share a common Romanian culture, ancestry, and speak the Romanian language, the most widespread spoken Eastern Romance language which is descended from the Latin language. According to the 2011 Romanian census, just under 89% of Romania's citizens identified themselves as ethnic Romanians.\n\nIn one interpretation of the census results in Moldova, the Moldovans are counted as Romanians, which would mean that the latter form part of the majority in that country as well. Romanians are also an ethnic minority in several nearby countries situated in Central, respectively Eastern Europe, particularly in Hungary, Czech Republic, Ukraine (including Moldovans), Serbia, and Bulgaria.\n\nToday, estimates of the number of Romanian people worldwide vary from 26 to 30 million according to various sources, evidently depending on the definition of the term 'Romanian', Romanians native to Romania and Republic of Moldova and their afferent diasporas, native speakers of Romanian, as well as other Eastern Romance-speaking groups considered by most scholars as a constituent part of the broader Romanian people, specifically Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, Istro-Romanians, and Vlachs in Serbia (including medieval Vlachs), in Croatia, in Bulgaria, or in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nInhabited by the ancient Dacians, part of today's territory of Romania was conquered by the Roman Empire in 106, when Trajan's army defeated the army of Dacia's ruler Decebalus (\"see Dacian Wars\"). The Roman administration withdrew two centuries later, under the pressure of the Goths and Carpi.\n\nTwo theories account for the origin of the Romanian people. One, known as the Daco-Roman continuity theory, posits that they are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous peoples living in the Roman Province of Dacia, while the other posits that the Romanians are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous populations of the former Roman provinces of Illyria, Moesia, Thrace, and Macedon, and the ancestors of Romanians later migrated from these Roman provinces south of the Danube into the area which they inhabit today.\n\nAccording to the first theory, the Romanians are descended from indigenous populations that inhabited what is now Romania and its immediate environs: Thracians (Dacians, Getae) and Roman legionnaires and colonists. In the course of the two wars with the Roman legions, between AD 101–102 and AD 105–106 respectively, the emperor Trajan succeeded in defeating the Dacians and the greatest part of Dacia became a Roman province. \n\nThe colonisation with Roman or Romanized elements, the use of the Latin language and the assimilation of Roman civilisation as well as the intense development of urban centres led to the Romanization of part of the autochthonous population in Dacia. This process was probably concluded by the 10th century when the assimilation of the Slavs by the Daco-Romanians was completed.\n\nAccording to the south-of-the-Danube origin theory, the Romanians' ancestors, a combination of Romans and Romanized peoples of Illyria, Moesia and Thrace, moved northward across the Danube river into modern-day Romania. Small population groups speaking several versions of Romanian (Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, and Aromanian) still exist south of the Danube in Greece, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Serbia, but it is not known whether they themselves migrated from more northern parts of the Balkans, including Dacia. The south-of-the Danube theory usually favours northern Albania and/or Moesia (modern day Serbia and Northern Bulgaria) as the more specific places of Romanian ethnogenesis.\n\nSmall genetic differences were reportedly found among Southeastern European (Greece, Albania) populations and especially those of the Dniester–Carpathian (Romania, Moldova, Ukraine) region. Despite this low level of differentiation between them, tree reconstruction and principal component analyses allowed a distinction between Balkan–Carpathian (Romanians, Moldovans, Ukrainians, Macedonians and Gagauzes) and Balkan Mediterranean (Greeks, Albanians, Turks) population groups. The genetic affinities among Dniester–Carpathian and southeastern European populations do not reflect their linguistic relationships. According to the report, the results indicate that the ethnic and genetic differentiations occurred in these regions to a considerable extent independently of each other.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages Romanians were mostly known as Vlachs, a blanket term ultimately of Germanic origin, from the word Walha, used by ancient Germanic peoples to refer to Romance-speaking and Celtic neighbours. Besides the separation of some groups (Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians) during the Age of Migration, many Vlachs could be found all over the Balkans, in Transylvania, across Carpathian Mountains as far north as Poland and as far west as the regions of Moravia (part of the modern Czech Republic), some went as far east as Volhynia of western Ukraine, and the present-day Croatia where the Morlachs gradually disappeared, while the Catholic and Orthodox Vlachs took Croat and Serb national identity. \n\nBecause of the migrations that followed – such as those of Slavs, Bulgars, Hungarians, and Tatars – the Romanians were organised in agricultural communes (obști), developing large centralised states only in the 14th century, when the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia emerged to fight the Ottoman Empire. \n\nDuring the late Middle Ages, prominent medieval Romanian monarchs such as Bogdan of Moldavia, Stephen the Great, Mircea the Elder, Michael the Brave, or Vlad the Impaler took part actively in the history of Central Europe by waging tumultuous wars and leading noteworthy crusades against the then continuously expanding Ottoman Empire, at times allied with either the Kingdom of Poland or the Kingdom of Hungary in these causes.\n\nEventually the entire Balkan peninsula was annexed by the Ottoman Empire. However, Moldavia and Wallachia (extending to Dobruja and Bulgaria) were not entirely subdued by the Ottomans as both principalities became autonomous (which was not the case of other Ottoman territorial possessions in Europe). Transylvania, a third region inhabited by an important majority of Romanian speakers, was a vassal state of the Ottomans until 1687, when the principality became part of the Habsburg possessions. The three principalities were united for several months in 1600 under the authority of Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave.\nAdditionally, in medieval times there were other lands known by the name 'Vlach' (such as Great Vlachia, situated between Thessaly and the western Pindus mountains, originally within the Byzantine Empire, but after the 13th century autonomous or semi-independent; White Wallachia, a Byzantine denomination for the region between the Danube River and the Balkans; Moravian Wallachia, a region in south-eastern Czech Republic).\n\nUp until 1541, Transylvania was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, later (due to the conquest of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire) was a self-governed Principality governed by the Hungarian nobility. In 1699 it became a part of the Habsburg lands. By the 19th century, the Austrian Empire was awarded by the Ottomans with the region of Bukovina and, in 1812, the Russians occupied the eastern half of Moldavia, known as Bessarabia.\n\nIn the context of the 1848 Romanticist and liberal revolutions across Europe, the events that took place in the Grand Principality of Transylvania were the first of their kind to unfold in the Romanian-speaking territories. On the one hand, the Transylvanian Saxons and the Transylvanian Romanians (with consistent support on behalf of the Austrian Empire) successfully managed to oppose the goals of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, with the two noteworthy historical figures leading the common Romanian-Saxon side at the time being Avram Iancu and Stephan Ludwig Roth.\n\nOn the other hand, the Wallachian revolutions of 1821 and 1848 as well as the Moldavian Revolution of 1848, which aimed for independence from Ottoman and Russian foreign rulership, represented important impacts in the process of spreading the liberal ideology in the eastern and southern Romanian lands, in spite of the fact that all three eventually failed. Nonetheless, in 1859, Moldavia and Wallachia elected the same ruler, namely Alexander John Cuza (who reigned as \"Domnitor\") and were thus unified \"de facto\", resulting in the United Romanian Principalities for the period between 1859 and 1881.\n\nDuring the 1870s, the United Romanian Principalities (then led by Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen Domnitor Carol I) fought a War of Independence against the Ottomans, with Romania's independence being formally recognised in 1878 at the Treaty of Berlin. Although the newly founded Kingdom of Romania initially allied with Austria-Hungary, Romania refused to enter World War I on the side of the Central Powers, because it was obliged to wage war only if Austria-Hungary was attacked. In 1916, Romania joined the war on the side of the Triple Entente. \n\nAs a result, at the end of the war, Transylvania, Bessarabia, and Bukovina were awarded to Romania, through a series of international peace treaties, resulting in an enlarged and far more powerful kingdom under King Ferdinand I. As of 1920, the Romanian people was believed to number over 15 million solely in the region of the Romanian kingdom, a figure larger than the populations of Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands combined.\n\nDuring the interwar period, two additional monarchs came to the Romanian throne, namely Carol II and Michael I. This short-lived period was marked, at times, by political instabilities and efforts of maintaining a constitutional monarchy in favour of other, totalitarian regimes such as an absolute monarchy or a military dictatorship.\n\nDuring World War II, the Kingdom of Romania lost territory both to the east and west, as Northern Transylvania became part of Hungary through the Second Vienna Award, while Bessarabia and northern Bukovina were taken by the Soviets and included in the Moldavian SSR, respectively Ukrainian SSR. The eastern territory losses were facilitated by the Molotov-Ribbentrop German-Soviet non-aggression pact. \n\nAfter the end of the war, the Romanian Kingdom managed to regain territories lost westward but was nonetheless not given Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, the aforementioned regions being forcefully incorporated into the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the Soviet Union imposed a Communist government and King Michael was forced to abdicate and leave for exile. Nicolae Ceauşescu became the head of the Romanian Communist Party in 1965 and his draconian rule of the 1980s was ended by the Romanian Revolution of 1989.\n\nThe 1989 revolution brought to power the dissident communist Ion Iliescu. He remained in power as head of state until 1996, when he was defeated by CDR-supported Emil Constantinescu at the 1996 general elections, the first in post-Communist Romania that saw a peaceful transition of power. Following Constantinescu's only term as president from 1996 to 2000, Iliescu was re-elected in late 2000 for another term of four years. In 2004, Traian Băsescu, the PNL-PD candidate, was elected president. Five years later, Băsescu was narrowly re-elected for a second term at the 2009 presidential elections. \n\nIn 2014, the PNL-PDL candidate Klaus Johannis won a surprise victory over former prime minister and PSD-supported contender Victor Ponta in the second round of the 2014 presidential elections. Thus, Johannis became the first Romanian president stemming from an ethnic minority (as he belongs to the Romanian-German community, being a Transylvanian Saxon).\n\nIn the meantime, Romania's major foreign policy achievements were the alignment with Western Europe and the United States by joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 and the European Union three years later, in 2007.\n\nThe prevailing element in Wallachia (Ploiești, Dolj), Moldavia (Piatra Neamț, Buhuși), Dobruja (Constanţa), and northern Republic of Moldova is recorded to be Haplogroup I, while the gene pool of Transylvania is often untypical and diverse.\n\nAccording to self-published data, the Y-DNA haplogroup frequencies of 962 Romanians (and unknown part of Moldovans) are as follows: 28% I2, 18% R1a, 15% R1b, 14% E1b1b, 14% J2, 4% I1, 3% G2a, 2% N1c, 1% J1, 1% T and Q. On the basis of 361 samples, Haplogroup I occurs at 32% in Romanians. The highest frequency of I2a1 (I-P37) in the Balkans today was present before the Slavic expansion and is owed to indigenous tribes, and is particularly suggested to have been common among the ancient Thracians in Romania. \n\nAccording to 335 sampled Romanians, 15% of them belong to R1a. Haplogroup R1a among Romanians is entirely from the Eastern European variety Z282 and may be a result of Baltic, Thracian or Slavic descent. R1a-Z280 outnumbers R1a-M458 among Romanians, the opposite phenomena is typical for Poles, Czechs and Bulgarians. 12% of the Romanians belong to R1b, the Alpino-Italic branch R1b-U152 is at 2% per 330 samples, a lower frequency recorded than other Balkan peoples.\n\nThe branches R1b-U106, R1b-DF27 and R1b-L21 make up 1% respectively. The eastern branches R1b-M269* and L23* (Z2103) make up 7% and outnumber the Atlantic branches, they prevail in parts of east, central Europe and as a result of Greek colonisation – in parts of Sicily as well. 8% of the Romanians belong to E1b1b1a1 (E-M78) per 265 samples.\n\nFrom a group of 178 males from 9 Romanian counties, mainly from Transylvania, most of them belong to the Paleolithic European lineage I2a (17% I2a1b, 2% I2a2, 3% I2*), to R1a (20%) and to E1b1b1a1b (19%). Haplogroup J2 is represented at 16% among them, unlike the structure in the Apennine Peninsula, among Romanians the J2b clade prevails. About 10% of these belong to Haplogroup R1b in all counties. R1b-U152, the specific Alpino-Italic clade, is represented at 3% among them, the prevailing branches are eastern, except for Brașov where Germanic U106 is most frequent. U106 is also prevalent clade of R1b in Buhuși and Piatra Neamț. In Brașov and Dolj I2 prevails, in Cluj – R1a. Another 6% of these belong to I1 and 2% to G2a. T, N, Q are also represented by frequencies of less than a percent.\n\nDespite negligible Roman genetic traits in general, one study of 219 Romanians found strong indications in other parts of Transylvania, in the region corresponding to Roman Dacia. The highest frequency of R1b (31–32%) in Eastern Europe only behind Trebic in the Czech Republic (32.7%) was found in the Romanian counties Arad and Alba, that experienced Celtic settlement, the heaviest and only Roman colonisation with a significant number of colonists from Noricum and West Pannonia, and later German settlement. \n\nThe subclade of R1b was not revealed in the case, but no similar high or prevailing frequency of Eastern subclades of R1b has ever been found in Europe. Three of the ten towns that were almost exclusively populated by Roman citizens (Apulum, Ampelum and Potaissa) were in present Alba Iulia county, not far from the Roman capital Sarmizegetusa. Genetic isolate due to migration from unattested migration from the Middle East would not be a plausible historic-geographical event as even the eastern branch of R1b in Europe is different than these in the Middle East. The only ethnic groups with higher frequencies of R1b in the East are the Aromanians due to their main ancestry from the Roman West. In some occasions the U106 branch, which is minimal among Romanians, rises to the prevailing clade in some cities, but still at a low frequency. The high frequency of R1b was found in other places in Transylvania – 25% in Maramureș and Harghita, 20% in Mehedinți, 14% in Bihor, 11% in Vrancea, 0% in Neamț. Excluding Arad and Alba Iulia, Haplogroup I+G was found as most frequent in all, except Maramureș, where Haplogroup J was found to be prevalent.\n\nAccording to an autosomal analysis of eastern Europeans and adjacent peoples, the group of Bulgarians and Macedonians is located together with Romanians. Most West Slavs, Hungarians, and Austrians tend to share as many identical by-descent segments with South Slavs as with Romanians, Torbeshi and Gagauzes.\n\nShowing the importance of geography, a 2017 paper, concentrating on the mtDNA, signalling how Romania has been \"a major crossroads between Asia and Europe\" and thus \"experienced continuous migration and invasion episodes\", while precising that \"previous studies\" show Romanians \"exhibit genetic similarity with other Europeans\" or that \"another study pointed to possible segregation within the Middle East populations\", also mentions how \"signals of Asian maternal lineages were observed in all Romanian historical provinces, indicating gene flow along the migration routes through East Asia and Europe, during different time periods, namely, the Upper Paleolithic period and/or, with a likely greater preponderance, the Middle Ages\", and concludes that \"our current findings based on the mtDNA analysis of populations in historical provinces of Romania suggest similarity between populations in Transylvania and Central Europe,\" on one hand, as well between Wallachia, Moldavia, and Dobrudja with the Balkans, on the another, \"supported both by the observed clines in haplogroup frequencies for several European and Asian maternal lineages and MDS analyses.\"\n\nThe origins of the Romanian language, a Romance language, can be traced back to the Roman colonisation of the region. The basic vocabulary is of Latin origin, although there are some substratum words that are sometimes assumed to be of Dacian origin. Romanian language has retained the inflected structure of Latin grammar.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Romanian was isolated from the other Romance languages, and borrowed words from the nearby Slavic languages (see Slavic influence on Romanian). Later on, it borrowed a number of words from German, Hungarian, and Turkish. During the modern era, most neologisms were borrowed from French and Italian, though the language has increasingly begun to adopt English borrowings.\n\nThe Moldovan language, in its official form, is practically identical to Romanian, although there are some differences in colloquial speech. In the de facto independent (but internationally unrecognised) region of Transnistria, the official script used to write Moldovan is Cyrillic.\n\nAs of 2017, an Ethnologue estimation puts the (worldwide) number of Romanian speakers at approximately 24.15 million. The 24.15 million, however, represent only speakers of Romanian, not all of whom are necessarily ethnic Romanians. Also, this number does not include ethnic-Romanians who no longer speak the Romanian language.\n\nMany Romanian surnames have the suffix \"-escu\" or (less commonly) \"-aşcu\" or \"-ăscu\" which corresponds to the Latin suffix \"-iscus\" and means \"belonging to the people\". For example, \"Petrescu\" used to be \"Petre's keen\". Similar suffixes such as \"-asco\", \"-asgo\", \"-esque\", \"-ez\", etc. are present in other Latin-derived languages. Many Romanians in France changed this ending of their surnames to \"-esco\", because the way it is pronounced in French better approximates the Romanian pronunciation of \"-escu\".\n\nAnother widespread suffix of Romanian surnames is \"-eanu\" (or \"-an\", \"-anu\"), which indicates the geographical origin. Here some examples: Moldoveanu/Moldovan/Moldovanu, from the region of Moldavia or from river Moldova, Munteanu \"from mountains\", Jianu \"from Jiu river region\", Prut\"eanu\", meaning from the Prut river, Mureș\"anu\", meaning from the Mureș river, Petr\"eanu\" (meaning the son of Petre) etc..\n\nOther suffixes are \"-aru\" (or \"-oru\", \"-ar\", \"-or\"), which indicates an occupation (like Feraru \"smith\", Morar \"miller\"), and \"-ei\", usually preceded by \"A-\" in front of a female name, which is a Latin inherited female genitive, like in \" Amariei\" \"of Maria\", \"Aelenei\" \"of Elena\". These matrilineal-rooted surnames are common in the historical region of Moldavia.\n\nThe most common surnames are \"Pop\" / \"Popa\" (\"the priest\")—almost 200,000 Romanians have this surname—\"Popescu\" (\"son of the priest\") —almost 150,000 have this name— and \"Ionescu\" (\"John's (Ion's) son\").\n\nIn English, Romanians are usually called Romanians, Rumanians, or Roumanians except in some historical texts, where they are called Roumans or Vlachs.\n\nFrom the Middle Ages, Romanians bore two names, the exonym (one given to them by foreigners) \"Wallachians\" or \"Vlachs\", under its various forms (vlah, valah, valach, voloh, blac, olăh, vlas, ilac, ulah, etc.), and the endonym (the name they used for themselves) \"Romanians\" (Rumâni/Români).\n\nThe name \"Romanian\" is derived from Latin \"Romanus\". Under regular phonetical changes that are typical to the Romanian languages, the name \"romanus\" over the centuries transformed into \"rumân\" . An older form of \"român\" was still in use in some regions. Socio-linguistic evolutions in the late 18th century led to a gradual preponderance of the \"român\" spelling form, which was then generalised during the National awakening of Romania of early 19th century.\n\nUntil the 19th century, the term Romanian denoted the speakers of the Daco-Romanian dialect of the Romanian language, thus being a much more distinct concept than that of Romania, the country of the Romanians. Prior to 1867, the (Daco-)Romanians were part of different statal entities: with the Moldavians and the Wallachians being split off and having shaped separate political identities, possessing states of their own, and with the rest of Romanians being part of other states. However, they retained their Romanian cultural and ethnic identity.\n\nTo distinguish Romanians from the other Romanic peoples of the Balkans (Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians), the term Daco-Romanian is sometimes used to refer to those who speak the standard Romanian language and live in the territory of ancient Dacia (today comprising mostly Romania and Moldova), although some Daco-Romanians can be found in the eastern part of Central Serbia (which was part of ancient Moesia).\n\nThe name of \"Vlachs\" is an exonym that was used by Slavs to refer to all Romanized natives of the Balkans. It holds its origin from ancient Germanic—being a cognate to \"Welsh\" and \"Walloon\"—and perhaps even further back in time, from the Roman name Volcae, which was originally a Celtic tribe. From the Slavs, it was passed on to other peoples, such as the Hungarians (\"Oláh\") and Greeks (\"Vlachoi\") (see the Etymology section of Vlachs). Wallachia, the Southern region of Romania, takes its name from the same source.\n\nNowadays, the term Vlach is more often used to refer to the Romanized populations of the Balkans who speak Daco-Romanian, Aromanian, Istro-Romanian and Megleno-Romanian.\n\nThese are family names that have been derived from either \"Vlach\" or \"Romanian\". Most of these names have been given when a Romanian settled in a non-Romanian region. Examples: Oláh (37,147 Hungarians have this name), Vlach, Vlahuta, Vlasa, Vlasi, Vlašic, Vlasceanu, Vlachopoulos, Voloh, Volyh, Vlack, Flack and Vlax.\n\nMost Romanians live in Romania, where they constitute a majority; Romanians also constitute a minority in the countries that neighbour Romania. Romanians can also be found in many countries, notably in the other EU countries, particularly in Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom and France; in North America in the United States and Canada; in Israel; as well as in Brazil, Australia, Argentina, and New Zealand among many other countries. Italy and Spain have been popular emigration destinations, due to a relatively low language barrier, and both are each now home to about a million Romanians. With respect to geopolitical identity, many individuals of Romanian ethnicity in Moldova prefer to identify themselves as Moldovans.\n\nThe contemporary total population of ethnic Romanians cannot be stated with any degree of certainty. A disparity can be observed between official sources (such as census counts) where they exist, and estimates which come from non-official sources and interested groups. Several inhibiting factors (not unique to this particular case) contribute towards this uncertainty, which may include:\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the decennial US Census of 2000 calculated (based on a statistical sampling of household data) that there were 367,310 respondents indicating Romanian ancestry (roughly 0.1% of the total population).\n\nThe actual total recorded number of foreign-born Romanians was only 136,000 Migration Information Source However, some non-specialist organisations have produced estimates which are considerably higher: a 2002 study by the Romanian-American Network Inc. mentions an estimated figure of 1,200,000 for the number of Romanian-Americans. \n\nThis estimate notes however that \"...other immigrants of Romanian national minority groups have been included such as: Armenians, Germans, Gypsies, Hungarians, Jews, and Ukrainians\". It also includes an unspecified allowance for second- and third-generation Romanians, and an indeterminate number living in Canada. An error range for the estimate is not provided. For the United States 2000 Census figures, almost 20% of the total population did not classify or report an ancestry, and the census is also subject to undercounting, an incomplete (67%) response rate, and sampling error in general.\n\nRomanians have played and contributed a major role in the advancement of the arts, culture, sciences, technology and engineering.\n\nIn the history of aviation, Traian Vuia and Aurel Vlaicu built and tested some of the earliest aircraft designs, while Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics. Victor Babeş discovered more than 50 germs and a cure for a disease named after him, babesiosis; biologist Nicolae Paulescu discovered insulin. Another biologist, Emil Palade, received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology. George Constantinescu created the theory of sonics, while mathematician Ştefan Odobleja is regarded as the ideological father behind cybernetics – his work \"The Consonantist Psychology\" (Paris, 1938) was the main source of inspiration for N. Wiener's \"Cybernetics\" (Paris, 1948). Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesize amphetamine and also invented the modern method of refining crude oil.\n\nIn the arts and culture, prominent figures were George Enescu (music composer, violinist, professor of Sir Yehudi Menuhin), Constantin Brâncuși (sculptor), Eugène Ionesco (playwright), Mircea Eliade (historian of religion and novelist), Emil Cioran (essayist, Prix de l'Institut Francais for stylism) and Angela Gheorghiu (soprano). More recently, filmmakers such as Cristi Puiu and Cristian Mungiu have attracted international acclaim, as has fashion designer Ioana Ciolacu.\n\nIn sports, Romanians have excelled in a variety of fields, such as football (Gheorghe Hagi), gymnastics (Nadia Comăneci, Lavinia Miloşovici etc.), tennis (Ilie Năstase, Ion Ţiriac, Simona Halep), canoe racing (Ivan Patzaichin) and handball (four times men's World Cup winners).\nCount Dracula is a worldwide icon of Romania. This character was created by the Irish fiction writer Bram Stoker, based on some stories spread in the late Middle Ages by the frustrated German trademen of Kronstadt (Braṣov) and on some Vampire folk tales about the historic Romanian figure of Prince Vlad Ţepeş.\n\nAlmost 90% of all Romanians consider themselves religious. The vast majority are Eastern Orthodox Christians, belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church (a branch of Eastern Orthodoxy, or Eastern Orthodox Church, together with the Greek Orthodox, Orthodox Church of Georgia and Russian Orthodox Churches, among others). \n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 93.6% of ethnic Romanians in Romania identified themselves as Romanian Orthodox (in comparison to 86.8% of Romania's total population, including other ethnic groups). However, the actual rate of church attendance is significantly lower and many Romanians are only nominally believers. For example, according to a 2006 Eurobarometer poll, only 23% of Romanians attend church once a week or more. A 2006 poll conducted by the Open Society Foundation found that only 33% of Romanians attended church once a \"month\" or more.\n\nRomanian Catholics are present in Transylvania, Banat, Bukovina, Bucharest, and parts of Moldavia, belonging to both the Roman Catholic Church (297,246 members) and the Romanian Greek-Catholic Catholic Church (124,563 members). According to the 2011 census, 2.5% of ethnic Romanians in Romania identified themselves as Catholic (in comparison to 4.3% of Romania's total population, including other ethnic groups). Around 1.6% of ethnic Romanians in Romania identify themselves as Pentecostal, with the population numbering 276,678 members. Smaller percentages are Protestant, Jews, Muslims, agnostic, atheist, or practice a traditional religion.\n\nThere are no official dates for the adoption of religions by the Romanians. Based on linguistic and archaeological findings, historians suggest that the Romanians' ancestors acquired polytheistic religions in the Roman era, later adopting Christianity, certainly by the 4th century CE when decreed by Emperor Constantine as the official religion of the Roman Empire. Like in all other Romance languages, the basic Romanian words related to Christianity are inherited from Latin, such as \"God\" (\"Dumnezeu\" < Domine Deus), \"church\" (\"biserică\" < basilica), \"cross\" (\"cruce\" < crux, -cis), \"angel\" (\"înger\" < angelus), \"saint\" (regional: \"sfân(t)\" < sanctus), \"Christmas\" (\"Crăciun\" < creatio, -onis), \"Christian\" (\"creştin\" < christianus), \"Easter\" (\"paşte\" < paschae), \"sin\" (\"păcat\" < peccatum), \"to baptise\" (\"a boteza\" < batizare), \"priest\" (\"preot\" < presbiterum), \"to pray\" (\"a ruga\" < rogare), \"faith\" ( \"credinţă\" < credentia ), and so on.\n\nAfter the Great Schism, there existed a Catholic Bishopric of Cumania (later, separate bishoprics in both Wallachia and Moldavia). However, this seems to be the exception, rather than the rule, as in both Wallachia and Moldavia the state religion was Eastern Orthodox. Until the 17th century, the official language of the liturgy was Old Church Slavonic. Then, it gradually changed to Romanian.\n\nAccording to a survey that took place in 2011, despite 94% of respondents answered positively for believing in God, 42% support the vision of Christian dogma that there is a God incarnated into a human being. While 34% of respondents said that there is only one true religion, 38% believe that there is one true religion and that other religions contain some basic truths, according to 18% there is one true religion and all major world religions contain some fundamental truths. 88% of Romanians believe in the existence of a soul, 87% believe in sin and the existence of heaven, 60% believe in an \"evil eye\", 25% believe in horoscopes and 23% in aliens. According to a 2004 survey, 80% consider themselves not superstitious and the same amount believe in angels, about 40% believe they have had dreams that became deja vu and 19% believe in ghosts.\n\nIn addition to the colours of the Romanian flag, each historical province of Romania has its own characteristic symbol:\nThe Coat of Arms of Romania combines these together.\n\nThe closest ethnic groups to the Romanians are the other Romanic peoples of Southeastern Europe: the Aromanians (Macedo-Romanians), the Megleno-Romanians, and the Istro-Romanians. The Istro-Romanians are the closest ethnic group to the Romanians, and it is believed they left Maramureș, Transylvania about a thousand years ago and settled in Istria, Croatia. Numbering about 500 people still living in the original villages of Istria while the majority left for other countries after World War II (mainly to Italy, United States, Canada, Germany, France, Sweden, Switzerland, and Australia), they speak the Istro-Romanian language, the closest living relative of Romanian.\n\nThe Aromanians and the Megleno-Romanians are Romanic peoples who live south of the Danube, mainly in Greece, Albania and the Republic of Macedonia, although some of them migrated to Romania in the 20th century. It is believed that they diverged from the Romanians in the 7th to 9th century, and currently speak the Aromanian language and Megleno-Romanian language, both of which are Eastern Romance languages, like Romanian, and are sometimes considered by traditional Romanian linguists to be dialects of Romanian.\n\n"}
{"id": "26054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26054", "title": "Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor", "text": "Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor\n\nRudolf II (18 July 1552 – 20 January 1612) was Holy Roman Emperor (1576–1612), King of Hungary and Croatia (as Rudolf I, 1572–1608), King of Bohemia (1575–1608/1611) and Archduke of Austria (1576–1608). He was a member of the House of Habsburg.\n\nRudolf's legacy has traditionally been viewed in three ways: an ineffectual ruler whose mistakes led directly to the Thirty Years' War; a great and influential patron of Northern Mannerist art; and an intellectual devotee of occult arts and learning which helped seed what would be called the scientific revolution.\n\nRudolf was born in Vienna on 18 July 1552. He was the eldest son and successor of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia, and King of Hungary and Croatia; his mother was Maria of Spain, a daughter of Charles V and Isabella of Portugal. He was the elder brother of Matthias who was to succeed him as king of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nRudolf spent eight formative years, from age 11 to 19 (1563–1571), in Spain, at the court of his maternal uncle Philip II. After his return to Vienna, his father was concerned about Rudolf's aloof and stiff manner, typical of the more conservative Spanish court, rather than the more relaxed and open Austrian court; but his Spanish mother saw in him courtliness and refinement. Rudolf would remain for the rest of his life reserved, secretive, and largely a homebody who did not like to travel or even partake in the daily affairs of state. He was more intrigued by occult learning such as astrology and alchemy, which was mainstream in the Renaissance period, and had a wide variety of personal hobbies such as horses, clocks, collecting rarities, and being a patron of the arts. He suffered from periodic bouts of \"melancholy\" (depression), which was common in the Habsburg line. These became worse with age, and were manifested by a withdrawal from the world and its affairs into his private interests.\n\nLike his near contemporary, Elizabeth I of England (who was born 19 years before he was), Rudolf dangled himself as a prize in a string of diplomatic negotiations for marriages, but never in fact married. During his periods of self-imposed isolation, Rudolf reportedly had affairs with his court chamberlain, Wolfgang von Rumpf, and a series of valets. One of these, Philip Lang, ruled him for years and was hated by those seeking favour with the emperor.\n\nIn addition, Rudolf was known to have had a succession of affairs with women, some of whom claimed to have been impregnated by him. He had several illegitimate children with his mistress Catherina Strada. Their eldest son, Don Julius Caesar d'Austria, was likely born between 1584 and 1586 and received an education and opportunities for political and social prominence from his father. In 1607, Rudolf sent Julius to live at Český Krumlov in Bohemia (in the modern-day Czech Republic), a castle which Rudolf purchased from the last of the House of Rosenberg (Peter Vok/Wok von Rosenberg) after he fell into financial ruin. Julius lived at Český Krumlov when in 1608 he reportedly abused and murdered the daughter of a local barber, who had been living in the castle, and then disfigured her body. Rudolf condemned his son's act and suggested that he should be imprisoned for the rest of his life. However, Julius died in 1609 after showing signs of schizophrenia, refusing to bathe, and living in squalor; his death was apparently caused by an ulcer that ruptured.\n\nMany artworks commissioned by Rudolf are unusually erotic. The emperor was the subject of a whispering campaign by his enemies in his family and the Catholic Church in the years before he was deposed. Sexual allegations may well have formed a part of the campaign against him.\n\nHistorians have traditionally blamed Rudolf's preoccupation with the arts, occult sciences, and other personal interests as the reason for the political disasters of his reign. More recently historians have re-evaluated this view and see his patronage of the arts and occult sciences as a triumph and key part of the Renaissance, while his political failures are seen as a legitimate attempt to create a unified Christian empire, which was undermined by the realities of religious, political and intellectual disintegrations of the time.\n\nAlthough raised in his uncle's Catholic court in Spain, Rudolf was tolerant of Protestantism and other religions including Judaism. He largely withdrew from Catholic observances, even in death denying last sacramental rites. He had little attachment to Protestants either, except as counter-weight to papal policies. He put his primary support behind conciliarists, irenicists and humanists. When the papacy instigated the Counter-Reformation, using agents sent to his court, Rudolf backed those who he thought were the most neutral in the debate, not taking a side or trying to effect restraint, thus leading to political chaos and threatening to provoke civil war.\n\nHis conflict with the Ottoman Empire was the final cause of his undoing. Unwilling to compromise with the Turks, and stubbornly determined that he could unify all of Christendom with a new Crusade, he started a long and indecisive war with the Turks in 1593. This war lasted till 1606, and was known as \"The Long War\". By 1604 his Hungarian subjects were exhausted by the war and revolted, led by Stephen Bocskay (Bocskai Uprising). In 1605 Rudolf was forced by his other family members to cede control of Hungarian affairs to his younger brother Archduke Matthias. Matthias by 1606 forged a difficult peace with the Hungarian rebels (Peace of Vienna) and the Turks (Peace of Zsitvatorok). Rudolf was angry with his brother's concessions, which he saw as giving away too much in order to further Matthias' hold on power. So Rudolf prepared to start a new war with the Turks. But Matthias rallied support from the disaffected Hungarians and forced Rudolf to cede the crowns of Hungary, Austria, and Moravia to him. At the same time, seeing a moment of royal weakness, Bohemian Protestants demanded greater religious liberty, which Rudolf granted in the \"Letter of Majesty\" in 1609. The Bohemians continued to press for further freedoms, and Rudolf used his army to repress them. The Bohemian Protestants then appealed to Matthias for help; Matthias' army then held Rudolf prisoner in his castle in Prague, until 1611, when Rudolf ceded the crown of Bohemia to his brother.\n\nRudolf died in 1612, nine months after he had been stripped of all effective power by his younger brother, except the empty title of Holy Roman Emperor, to which Matthias was elected five months later. In May 1618 with the event known as the Defenestration of Prague, the Protestant Bohemians, in defence of the rights granted them in the \"Letter of Majesty\", threw imperial officials out of the window and thus the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) started.\n\nRudolf moved the Habsburg capital from Vienna to Prague in 1583. Rudolf loved collecting paintings, and was often reported to sit and stare in rapture at a new work for hours on end. He spared no expense in acquiring great past masterworks, such as those of Dürer and Brueghel. He was also patron to some of the best contemporary artists, who mainly produced new works in the Northern Mannerist style, such as Bartholomeus Spranger, Hans von Aachen, Giambologna, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Aegidius Sadeler, Roelant Savery, and Adrian de Vries, as well as commissioning works from Italians like Veronese. Rudolf's collections were the most impressive in the Europe of his day, and the greatest collection of Northern Mannerist art ever assembled. The adjective Rudolfine, as in \"Rudolfine Mannerism\" is often used in art history to describe the style of the art he patronized.\n\nRudolf's love of collecting went far beyond paintings and sculptures. He commissioned decorative objects of all kinds and in particular mechanical moving devices. Ceremonial swords and musical instruments, clocks, water works, astrolabes, compasses, telescopes and other scientific instruments, were all produced for him by some of the best craftsmen in Europe.\n\nHe patronized natural philosophers such as the botanist Charles de l'Ecluse, and the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler both attended his court. Tycho Brahe developed the Rudolphine Tables (finished by Kepler, after Brahe's death), the first comprehensive table of data of the movements of the planets. As mentioned before, Rudolf also attracted some of the best scientific instrument makers of the time, such as Jost Bürgi, Erasmus Habermel and Hans Christoph Schissler. They had direct contact with the court astronomers and, through the financial support of the court, they were economically independent to develop scientific instruments and manufacturing techniques.\nThe poet Elizabeth Jane Weston, a writer of Renaissance Latin poetry, was also part of his court and wrote numerous odes to him.\n\nRudolf kept a menagerie of exotic animals, botanical gardens, and Europe's most extensive \"cabinet of curiosities\" (\"Kunstkammer\") incorporating \"the three kingdoms of nature and the works of man\". It was housed at Prague Castle, where between 1587 and 1605 he built the northern wing to house his growing collections. A lion and a tiger were allowed to roam the castle, documented by the account books which record compensation paid to survivors of attacks, or to family members of victims.\n\nRudolf was even alleged by one person to have owned the Voynich manuscript, a codex whose author and purpose, as well as the language and script and posited cipher remain unidentified to this day. According to hearsay passed on in a letter written by Johannes Marcus Marci in 1665, Rudolf was said to have acquired the manuscript at some unspecified time for 600 gold ducats. No evidence in support of this single piece of hearsay has ever been discovered. The Codex Gigas was also in his possessions. \n\nAs was typical of the time, Rudolf II had a portrait painted in the studio of the renowned Alonso Sanchez Coello. Completed in 1567 by Alonso Sanchez Coello, the portrait depicted Rudolf II at the age of 15. This painting can be seen at the Lobkowicz Palace in the Rozmberk room.\n\nBy 1597, the collection occupied three rooms of the incomplete northern wing. When building was completed in 1605, the collection was moved to the dedicated \"Kunstkammer\". \"Naturalia\" (minerals and gemstones) were arranged in a 37 cabinet display that had three vaulted chambers in front, each about 5.5 metres wide by 3 metres high and 60 metres long, connected to a main chamber 33 metres long. Large uncut gemstones were held in strong boxes.\n\nRudolf's \"Kunstkammer\" was not a typical \"cabinet of curiosities\" – a haphazard collection of unrelated specimens. Rather, the Rudolfine \"Kunstkammer\" was systematically arranged in an encyclopaedic fashion. In addition, Rudolf II employed his polyglot court physician, Anselmus Boetius de Boodt (\"c.\" 1550–1632), to curate the collection. De Boodt was an avid mineral collector. He travelled widely on collecting trips to the mining regions of Germany, Bohemia and Silesia, often accompanied by his Bohemian naturalist friend, Thaddaeus Hagecius. Between 1607 and 1611, De Boodt catalogued the \"Kunstkammer\", and in 1609 he published \"Gemmarum et Lapidum\", one of the finest mineralogical treatises of the 17th century.\nAs was customary at the time, the collection was private, but friends of the Emperor, artists, and professional scholars were allowed to study it. The collection became an invaluable research tool during the flowering of 17th-century European philosophy, the \"Age of Reason\".\n\nRudolf's successors did not appreciate the collection and the \"Kunstkammer\" gradually fell into disarray. Some 50 years after its establishment, most of the collection was packed into wooden crates and moved to Vienna. The collection remaining at Prague was looted during the last year of the Thirty Years War, by Swedish troops who sacked Prague Castle on 26 July 1648, also taking the best of the paintings, many of which later passed to the Orléans Collection after the death of Christina of Sweden. In 1782, the remainder of the collection was sold piecemeal to private parties by Joseph II. One of the surviving items from the \"Kunstkammer\" is a \"fine chair\" looted by the Swedes in 1648 and now owned by the Earl of Radnor at Longford Castle in England; others survive in museums.\n\nAstrology and alchemy were regarded as mainstream scientific fields in Renaissance Prague, and Rudolf was a firm devotee of both. His lifelong quest was to find the Philosopher's Stone and Rudolf spared no expense in bringing Europe's best alchemists to court, such as Edward Kelley and John Dee. Rudolf even performed his own experiments in a private alchemy laboratory. When Rudolf was a prince, Nostradamus prepared a horoscope which was dedicated to him as 'Prince and King'. In the 1590s Sendivogius was active at Rudolph's court. \n\nRudolf gave Prague a mystical reputation that persists in part to this day, with Alchemists' Alley on the grounds of Prague Castle a popular visiting place and tourist attraction.\n\nRudolf is also the ruler in many of the legends of the Golem of Prague, either because of, or simply adding to, his occult reputation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18777523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18777523", "title": "Sai On", "text": "Sai On\n\n' (1682–1761), or Cai Wen in Chinese, also known as ', was a scholar-bureaucrat official of the Ryūkyū Kingdom, serving as regent, instructor, and advisor to King Shō Kei. He is renowned for the many reforms he initiated and oversaw, and is among the most famous figures in Okinawan history. He edited \"Chūzan Seifu\", a rewrite of \"Chūzan Seikan\" by his father Sai Taku.\n\nSai On was born in Kumemura, the village within the major port city of Naha which served as the chief center of classical Chinese learning in Okinawa, and the source of the vast majority of the scholar-bureaucrats who were raised to serve in the administration of the kingdom. His father had likewise been a scholar-bureaucrat of Kumemura, educated in the Confucian classics, and had served on several tribute missions to China. Sai On's father wrote the \"Chūzan Seifu\" by rewriting the \"Chūzan Seikan\" in 1701. Unlike \"Chūzan Seikan\", which was written in Japanese Kanbun, \"Chūzan Seifu\" is written in Classical Chinese. Sai On edited \"Chūzan Seifu\" in 1724, and it is believed that this was to give the work a pro-Chinese point of view.\n\nAt the age of 27, Sai On traveled to Guangzhou in China, where he studied economics, geography, and political administration alongside the more traditional Chinese classics. Upon returning from China, Sai On was made instructor to the Crown Prince; upon the prince's accession to the throne as King Shō Kei in 1713, Sai On was elevated in position and power, and led the investiture mission to China in 1716. In 1728, he became a member of the \"Sanshikan\", the Council of Three chief royal advisors. Though Sai On was not of royal blood and so could not be named \"Sessei\" (a post which historian George Kerr translates as \"prime minister\"), reorganizations were undertaken within the government allowing Sai On extensive authority and powers. Under his guidance, a number of land reforms were put into place, including the reclamation of land for agriculture, relocation and establishment of settlements, irrigation, flood control, and the planting of trees. In a series of reforms very similar to those implemented in Japan around the same time, strict limitations were placed on farmers moving to the cities, and on the amount of craft work, such as woodworking and metalworking, which farmers were permitted to do. Thus, agricultural production was intensified and made more efficient while artisans were focused in the twin cities of Naha and Shuri. Within a few years of the beginning of the implementation of Sai On's economic reforms and construction, reclamation and conservation projects, the kingdom was producing more than ever before.\n\nIn addition, the \"anji\", hereditary lords of territories throughout the kingdom, were given stipends from the government in the form of rice, beginning in 1723. This tied them closer to the central government and also safeguarded to some extent their economic well-being, as they would no longer need to rely solely on inheritance for their relative wealth. Aristocrats were also encouraged to become artisans, with no loss of court rank or status, and in 1734, taxes upon artisans in the cities were eliminated, further encouraging an expansion of craft production. In addition, various forms of official government recognition for exemplary artisans, artists, and performers were introduced.\n\nOkinawa's demand for wood outstripped the ability of the forests to renew themselves on their own, naturally, and the combination of deforestation and rainy weather including regular typhoon seasons led to extensive erosion and landslides. Sai On is particularly known for the forestry and soil conservation efforts undertaken under his guidance to combat these problems. Particular trees and sections of forest throughout the islands are still today called　\"Sai On pines\" (蔡温松, \"Sai On matsu\"; 蔡温並木, \"Sai On namiki\"), and his essays on the subject of forestry and conservation remained so valued that the post-war United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands translated, published, and distributed them abroad in 1952. In addition to these essays, Sai On produced a number of other documents, including a handbook for administrative officials in the provinces entitled \"Yomui-kan\", and \"Ryokōnin Kokoroe\" (旅行人心得), or \"Travelers' Advice\", a guide for Okinawans abroad in China to help them in obscuring from the Chinese the relationship between Okinawa and Japan's Satsuma Domain.\n\nA rival government faction rose up against Sai On in 1734, accusing him of being too pro-Chinese, led by a pair of scholar-bureaucrats, Heshikiya Chōbin and Tomoyose Anjō. Before any plots against Sai On could be executed, however, Chōbin and fourteen others were arrested and put to death.\n\nSai On retired from his ministerial post in 1752, the year after Shō Kei's death, but remained influential until his own death at the age of 79 in 1761.\n"}

She is known for her \"Semi-Homemade\" cooking concept, which Lee describes as using 70 percent pre-packaged products and 30 percent fresh items.\n\nChristiansen was born in Santa Monica, California, the daughter of Vicky and Wayne Christiansen. When Sandra was 2, her mother had her and her younger sister Cindy live with their paternal grandmother, Lorraine. By 1972, the girls' parents had divorced; their mother remarried, moving them to Sumner, Washington. When Lee was 11, her mother divorced for a second time. Lee by this time had three additional siblings, Kimmy, Richie and Johnny. At 15, following a beating by her mother, Lee moved in with her boyfriend, Duane, and on June 30, 1982, left for Wisconsin to live with her father and his girlfriend. She graduated from Onalaska High School in Onalaska, Wisconsin, and later attended the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. She was raised as a Seventh-Day Adventist and later her family became Jehovah's Witness.\n\nIn December of her junior year, she left college to live near family in Malibu, California. She later attended a two week recreational course at Le Cordon Bleu in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada which she did not finish.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Lee created a product called \"Sandra Lee Kraft Kurtains\", a home-decorating tool that used a wire rack and sheets or other fabric samples to create decorative drapery. The product was sold via infomercials and cable shopping networks. Home-shopping network QVC hired her as on-air talent; in her first 18 months on the network, Lee sold $20 million worth of products.\n\n\"Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee\" premiered on the Food Network in 2003. Each episode contains an arts and crafts element, in which Lee decorates the table setting in accordance with the theme of the meal that she just prepared. She refers to these as \"tablescapes\". Lee's second Food Network series, \"Sandra's Money Saving Meals\", began airing on May 10, 2009.\nShe has released 25 books, including Sandra Lee \"Semi-Homemade: Cool Kids Cooking\" (October 2006) and a memoir, \"Made From Scratch\", which was released in November 2007. A magazine based on her show, \"Sandra Lee Semi-Homemade\", was released in 2009.\n\nIn 2012, Lee won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lifestyle/Culinary Host for Semi-Homemade Cooking.\n\nAlso in 2012, she started a new monthly lifestyle magazine in partnership with TV Guide. She is also starring in two new shows: \"Sandra’s Restaurant Remakes\" and \"Sandra Lee’s Taverns, Lounges & Clubs.\"\n\nIn November 2016, Lee won the Women's Entrepreneurship Day Pioneer Award held at the United Nations in New York City.\n\nWhen the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" ran a review of Lee's cookbook \"Semi-Homemade Cooking\" that criticized both her recipe and her \"Semi-Homemade\" concept,\nthe review's author received a response \"that was more impassioned than I anticipated\", with most readers agreeing with the article. However, a number of readers disagreed with the column. One reader wrote, \"Lots of people who don't want to take the time to shred a cup of carrots want to cook a good meal.\"\n\nKurt Soller, writing for \"Newsweek\", compared Lee's impact upon television cooking with that of Julia Child, noting that although Lee's show \"is the furthest from Child's methods\", both women \"filled a niche that hasn't yet been explored\".\n\nMuch of the criticism of Lee has coalesced around a recipe for \"Kwanzaa Cake\" that she demonstrated on a 2003 episode of \"Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee\". The recipe consisted of angel food cake topped with icing, cinnamon, apple pie filling, pumpkin seeds and corn nuts (all store-bought), with seven Kwanzaa candles then inserted into the cake.\n\nFood writer Anthony Bourdain, who was harshly critical of Lee in general, described the video clip of this segment of the show as \"eye searing\" and \"a war crime\". The cake was called \"scary\" by the \"Houston Chronicle\", and \"the most ghastly-sounding dish in Lee's culinary repertoire\" by \"Tulsa World\". \"Salon.com\" wrote that the video \"takes pride of place in the pantheon of hilarious culinary disaster videos\".\n\nCookbook author Denise Vivaldo, who claims to have ghostwritten recipes for many celebrity chefs, wrote a humorous post in \"The Huffington Post\" in December 2010 stating that she was responsible for the recipe (though she said that the candles were Lee's idea), and apologizing for it. She also wrote that Lee \"has incredibly bad food taste\". A week later, the post was removed, after Lee's lawyer threatened legal action. Lee has said this recipe is the only one of hers whose criticism she has taken to heart, and that the recipe was partly due to the Food Network dictating the show's content at the time.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005, she was married to KB Home CEO and philanthropist Bruce Karatz for whom she converted to Judaism. In the fall of 2005, Lee entered into a relationship with the future Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo. The two share homes in Chappaqua and Poughkeepsie.\n\nLee announced on May 12, 2015, that she had been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. By then she had undergone a lumpectomy, and was scheduled to have a double mastectomy later in the week. Governor Cuomo was to take some personal time to be with her during and after the surgery. On October 12, 2015, she was rushed to a hospital because of fluid buildup, believed to be a complication of her recovery, and was monitored closely in the next few days. Cuomo had been attending a Billy Joel concert at Nassau Coliseum, but left and went to the hospital. \nLee has been cancer free since mid-2016.\n\n"}

Sediqeh Dowlatabadi was a pioneer in the unveiling of women. In 1925, there was a debate within the intellectual community, newspapers and women's magazines about the unveiling of women as a method of modernizing Iran and increasing women's participation in society, and rumors that the government planned to introduce such a policy: though this reform did not come about, some women from intellectual circles started to appear unveiled in public for the first time, possibly with silent encouragement by the government, and Sediqeh Dowlatabadi is believed to have been the first woman to have done so. When the second Congress of Women of the East was arranged in Teheran in 1932, Princess Shams Pahlavi served as its president and Dowlatabadi as its secretary. When the shah banned the veil in 1936, Sediqeh Dowlatabadi was an active supporter of the reform, and engaged in the new women's committee Kanun-e banovan formed by the government and the shah's daughter Shams to unite women organisations and prepare women for unveiling.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15150919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15150919", "title": "The Prophesying Nun of Dresden", "text": "The Prophesying Nun of Dresden\n\nThe Prophecies of the Nun of Dresden, under the original Italian title of \"Le profezie della monaca di Dresda\", is a novel by Renzo Baschera which takes the form of an essay analyzing several manuscripts purportedly found at the beginning of the 19th century. These manuscripts contain prophecies about the last Popes, the great European dynasties, technological progress, several disasters and the end of time, from the end of the 17th century to the end of the 30th century.\n\nThe \"Prophecies of the Nun of Dresden\" begins with an introduction, which shows the few historical notes of the prophetic manuscripts. These writings, according to Baschera's novel, were mentioned for the first time by a certain Abbot Nicolas Holb in 1808 in Vienna. The author of the manuscripts, written in the form of letters, was a German nun and clairvoyant whose actual name is not known. Of her, it is only known that she was “a pious Religious born in Dresden in 1680 and died in 1706” and that “ . . . her convent was on the banks of the Elbe” River. Some of the letters were written in German, some more in Latin and the others in both languages. This is surprising, especially considering the humble origins of the nun, who is thought to be illiterate.\n\nIn the third edition of the novel, the author adds a premise which claims to interpret the contemporary events (1986) in the light of the writings of the Nun, expecting the fulfillment of the predictions by the end of the 20th century.\n\nIn the main section of the novel, the author analyzes the documents in his possession, a series of thirty-one letters written to the people who lived at the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century. Some of them are in good condition, some are very damaged and others are copied. The analysis is divided into three groups:\n\nLetters to the Kings and Popes:\nLetters to the Cardinals:\nLetters to other Religious of the Catholic Church:\nIn letters to the historical figures several major events are predicted to happen to them and later their descendants or their country. In letters to the others, religious events are predicted general concern that some historical developments, some disasters and some technical progress. Letters of the Nun of Dresden prophesy events through a period of time from the end of the 17th century to the end of the 30th century.\n\nThe paper ends with a brief analysis of a particular aspect: the characters speak in a voice that suggests to the nun almost all of what to write. At first, the authority of the nun is posted with this entry, as is the case for most of the clairvoyants; subsequently, unlike the others that kept the detachment from all their visions, the woman accepted more and more the presence of what became the “sweet voice” letters, even when it promised catastrophe.\n\nAccording to the author, like the Prophecies of St. Malachy, the Nun of Dresden even gives a motto for the Popes, but only for the last eleven of them:\n\nThe author points out that the name chosen by each of the several popes is connected to the sign prophesied by the motto. The author also notes a link between the color of the horses, according to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the historical period in which the pope lived:\n\n\nIn a letter to Frederick I of Prussia, the nun predicts that “the last Peter will come from your land”. Prussia is the name of a historical region that now lies between the borders of Lithuania, Russia and Poland with parts of eastern Germany.\n\nIn her letter to Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, the visionary German made several prophecies about the House of Savoy. The letter is divided into three parts. In the first part, the nun warns the Duke about his conduct and is more a moral poem than a prophecy. The second part contains the prophecies about the Duke himself: already at the beginning, the nun turns to Victor Amadeus II, calling him the \"future king\", as he would very soon become the “king of an island” (that did really happen in 1713, in Sicily), then the king of another island (that happened in 1720, in Sardinia), and the “king of the mountains” (which, however, did not happen).\n\nIn the third part of the letter, the prophecies of the House of Savoy are contained. Savoy's reign is likened to a parade of horse-drawn carriages. There are actually two. In the first of them, each carriage was pulled by eight smaller horses (i.e., the Kingdom of Sardinia) and, in the second, each carriage had five larger horses (i.e., the Kingdom of Italy). So far, the total of the rulers of the House of Savoy is eleven. Eight of them were the Kings of Sardinia, from Victor Amadeus II to Victor Emmanuel II, and the other four were the Kings of Italy, from Victor Emmanuel II to Umberto II. According to the author, the total would be eleven, if one counts twice Victor Emmanuel II, who was both the King of Sardinia and the King of Italy. The nun predicts that, between the fourth and fifth “big horse-drawn carriage” (i.e., between the fourth and fifth Kings of Italy), there would be a pause, during which the carriage was driven by “black horses”, which the author interprets as a republican or oligarchic government. According to the interpretation of this prophecy by Baschera, Italy would now be in this moment of pause so, in the future, there could be a fifth King of Italy, the twelfth and last king of the House of Savoy. He would be represented by a horse with a white cross and reign for a short time. \n\nThe nun gives an indication of the duration of both the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Kingdom of Italy, before the Republican break: the first would have a duration of “twelve times twelve years” (144, three years more than the actual total of 141 years), while the second would have a duration of \"the year upside down\" for the first king of Italy (who died at the age of almost 58 years, after the reign of little more than 85 years). The nun also includes, for the five Kings of Italy from the House of Savoy, how they would die:\nShe, as interpreted by the author, also prophesied that the fifth and last king of the House of Savoy of Italy would die in exile, a natural death.\n\n\n\nThe same author, on the same subject, has also written the following book:\n"}
