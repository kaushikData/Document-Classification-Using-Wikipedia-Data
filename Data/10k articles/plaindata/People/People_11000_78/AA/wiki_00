Psychical researchers were convinced that all her phenomena were fraudulent but some suggested she may have been in a dissociated state. Researchers found the phantom faces suspicious, commenting that they had a strong resemblance to her own face.\n\nBesinnet refused to sit with the magician Harry Houdini. She had been exposed as a fraud by an undercover magician Fulton Oursler. During the séance he heard the medium leaving her chair, moved his shoe over the seat and discovered she was not there. Oursler in his exposure wrote that Besinnet had easily performed the phenomenon herself by getting up and moving around the room making noises. He had studied ventriloquism and stated all the voices were her own. As for the faces and lights, he suggested they were masks and observed a flashlight and, on another occasion, a rag in her hand.\n\nBesinnet was also caught cheating by psychical researcher James Hewat McKenzie. In response, Besinnet claimed she was unconscious in her séances and had no knowledge of the events that took place. Hereward Carrington who investigated Besinnet wrote that \"my own sittings with this medium left me entirely unconvinced of their genuineness.\"\n\nIn Toledo, Ohio the spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle attended séances with Besinnet and claimed the faces were of his mother and nephew. Doyle endorsed her as a genuine materialization medium. This was disputed by other researchers who noted Besinnet had already been caught utilizing tricks by Oursler, but Doyle had ignored the exposure. Psychical researcher J. Malcolm Bird who had attended a séance with Doyle was also skeptical and concluded \"I saw these particular apparitions almost as well as well as he did... they were not sufficiently clear to be identified at all, save by a liberal contribution of desire and imagination\".\n\nJames H. Hyslop of the American Society for Psychical Research concluded after attending 70 sittings that Besinnet was responsible for the all phenomena during the séances but her trance control was a \"secondary personality\".\n"}

Although she had been issued a diplomatic passport as the daughter of Kabila, after her death the government claimed that she was unrelated to the former president.\n\nAimée Kabila Mulengela was said to be the natural daughter of President Laurent-Désiré Kabila and Zaïna Kibangula.\nShe would thus be the half-sister of President Joseph Kabila.\nShe was born on 24 July 1976 in Kipushi, Democratic Republic of Congo.\nLaurent-Désiré Kabila was assassinated on 16 January 2001 in Kinshasa and was succeeded ten days later by his son Joseph Kabila.\n\nAimée's brother, Etienne Taratibu Kabila, left Kinshasa secretly in January 2002 for South Africa.\nHe wanted to take Aimée with him but that was not possible since she was the mother of four children.\nOn 25 February 2005 she married Alain Mayemba Bamba, alias \"Barracuda\".\nA diplomatic passport was issued to her in the name \"Aimée Kabila\" on 7 April 2005.\n\nOn 30 December 2005 Aimée Kabila Mulengela was taken from her home in Kinshasa/Ngaliema by Special Services police and soldiers of the Military Detection of Anti-Homeland Activities (DEMIIAP) and detained for 52 days.\nA report by the non-governmental organization \"La voix des sans-voix\" (VSV: Voice of the Voiceless) said her ex-husband Alain Mayemba Bamba ordered the detention, which would have been supported by Sifa Mahanya, mother of President Joseph Kabila.\nThe day after her detention her six month old baby was taken from her in her cell, and disappeared.\nShe was released on 24 February 2006.\nProperty taken at the time of her arrest, including money, jewelry, passports and other documents, were not returned.\n\nAimée Kabila Mulengela was killed in front of her children at her home in Mont Ngafula, Kinshasa, in the early morning of 16 January 2008.\nThe morning before the killing the armed men in Congolese National Police uniforms who were posted to guard the home were removed.\nShe appears to have been tortured before being shot by two armed men who broke into her home.\nAccording to her children and neighbors several jeeps were parked outside the house at the time, and the body at the morgue showed stab wounds and marks of torture. \nShe was survived by six children: Astrida Kabila (aged 15), Branly Kabila (13), Petit-Aimé Kabila (10), Mechak Kabila (8), Victor Kabila (6) and Victorine Aline Bamba (3).\n\nBefore her murder Aimée Kabila had been asking questions about the future of the property of Laurent-Désiré Kabila and the identity of his heirs.\nShe said she felt threatened and asked for United Nations protection in the DRC.\nAimée's brother, Etienne Taratibu Kabila, denounced the assassination the next day from his place of exile in South Africa, accusing the presidential guard of the killing.\nHer family were subsequently subject to threats and intimidation that made them fear claiming the body and arranging a funeral.\n\nFloribert Chebeya, president of VSV, which was investigating the death, said he feared that the police were trying to put pressure on him by summoning him for a road accident that had happened almost a year earlier.\nFloribert Chebeya was killed on 3 June 2010. He had been ordered to meet the national police chief, and had texted his wife to say he was at the police headquarters for the meeting, but it was not known what happened next. His partially undressed body was later found on the back seat of his own car.\nChebeya was still investigating Aimee's death, and was involved in other activities that were unwelcome to the government.\n\nThe official story was that the two killers were simply thieves who had bought a gun from an army deserter or the police, and Aimée Kabila Mulengela had been shot accidentally.\nTwo suspects were arrested on 25 January 2008 and the assault was reenacted two days later.\nGeneral Oleko, Provincial Inspector of Police in Kinshasa, said during a press briefing that the victim was not connected to the presidential family and that he did not recognise that she bore the name of Kabila.\nAccording to Ambassador Théodore Mugalu, the victim was named Aimée Mulengela Koko, with a father from North Kivu and a mother from Equateur.\nThe name Aimée Kabila had been assumed falsely.\n\nOn 12 February 2013 the government spokesman and media minister Lambert Mende Omalanga said Etienne Kabila was involved in a conspiracy against the DRC that had been foiled by the South African authorities.\nHe said Etienne Kabila was actually Etienne Kitsa, son of Raphael Kianzoluka of Bandundu and Françoise Kitsa Kikapu of South Kivu.\nHe repeated that Aimée Mulengela Kabila was in fact Aimée Mulengela, daughter of a sergeant of the former Zairean National Gendarmerie based in Kipushi.\nShe had been awarded a diplomatic passport based on her claim to be the daughter of the former president.\nUsing this identity she started a household with Alain Barracuda, a patron of Congolese music who was trying to get closer to the presidential family.\nHe said that Barracuda, having found that he had been tricked into investing large sums of money based on her assumed identity, had arranged to eliminate her physically on the night of 15 January 2008.\nWhen asked about the possibility of using DNA tests to put the matter to rest Lambert Mende strongly rejected the option, saying it would be a waste of time and money.\n\n"}

He escaped from Communist-controlled Hungary at the age of 20 and moved to the United States where he finished his education. He was one of the founders and the CEO of Intel, helping transform the company into the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors.\n\nAs a result of his work at Intel, along with his books and professional articles, Grove had a considerable influence on electronics manufacturing industries worldwide. He has been called the \"guy who drove the growth phase\" of Silicon Valley. In 1997, \"Time\" magazine chose him as \"Man of the Year\", for being \"the person most responsible for the amazing growth in the power and the innovative potential of microchips.\" One source notes that by his accomplishments at Intel alone, he \"merits a place alongside the great business leaders of the 20th century.\"\n\nIn 2000, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease; he became a contributor to several foundations that sponsor research towards a cure. He died at his home on March 21, 2016; the cause of death was unspecified.\n\nGrove was born to a middle-class Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, the son of Maria and George Gróf. At the age of four he contracted scarlet fever, which was nearly fatal and caused partial hearing loss.\n\nWhen he was eight, the Nazis occupied Hungary and deported nearly 500,000 Jews to concentration camps, including Auschwitz. Its commandant, Rudolf Höss, said at his trial that he killed 400,000 Hungarian Jews in three months. To avoid being arrested, Grove and his mother took on false identities and were sheltered by friends. His father, however, was arrested and taken to an Eastern Labor Camp to do forced labor, and was reunited with his family only after the war.\n\nDuring the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when he was 20, he left his home and family and escaped across the border into Austria. Penniless and barely able to speak English, in 1957 he eventually made his way to the United States. He later changed his name to the anglicized Andrew S. Grove. Grove summarized his first twenty years of life in Hungary in his memoirs:\nSoon after arriving in the United States, in New York, in 1957, he met his future wife, Eva Kastan, who was a fellow refugee. They met while he held a job as a busboy and she was a waitress. They married in June 1958 and remained married until his death. They had two daughters, Karen Grove and Robie Spector, and eight grandchildren.\n\nEven though he arrived in the United States with little money, Grove retained a \"passion for learning.\" He earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the City College of New York in 1960, followed by a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1963.\n\nAfter completing his Ph.D. in 1963, Grove worked at Fairchild Semiconductor as a researcher, and by 1967 had become its assistant director of development. His work there made him familiar with the early development of integrated circuits, which would lead to the \"microcomputer revolution\" in the 1970s. In 1967, he wrote a college textbook on the subject, \"Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices.\"\nIn 1968, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore co-founded Intel, after they and Grove left Fairchild Semiconductor. Grove joined on the day of its incorporation, although was not a founder according to the company. Fellow Hungarian émigré Leslie L. Vadász was Intel's fourth employee. Grove worked initially as the company's director of engineering, and helped get its early manufacturing operations started. In 1983, he wrote a book, \"High Output Management,\" in which he described many of his methods and manufacturing concepts.\n\nInitially, Intel primarily manufactured dynamic memory chips, DRAMs. By 1985, with less demand for their memory, production problems, and the challenges created by Japanese \"dumping\" of memory chips at below-cost prices, Grove was forced to make radical changes. As a result, he chose to discontinue producing DRAMs and focus instead on manufacturing microprocessors. Grove played a key role in negotiating with IBM to use only Intel microprocessors in all their new personal computers.\n\nThe company's revenue increased from $2,672 in its first year to $20.8 billion in 1997. Grove was Intel's president in 1979, its CEO in 1987 and its chairman and CEO in 1997. He relinquished his CEO title in May 1998, having been diagnosed with prostate cancer a few years earlier, and remained chairman of the board until November 2004. Grove continued his work at Intel as a senior advisor and had been a lecturer at Stanford University. He reflected back upon Intel's growth through the years:\nGrove is credited with having transformed Intel from a manufacturer of memory chips into one of the world's dominant producers of microprocessors. During his tenure as CEO, Grove oversaw a 4,500% increase in Intel's market capitalization from $4 billion to $197 billion, making it the world's 7th largest company, with 64,000 employees. Most of the company's profits were reinvested in research and development, along with building new facilities, in order to produce improved and faster microprocessors.\n\nAs director of operations, manufacturing became Grove's primary focus and his management style relied heavily on his management concepts. As the company expanded and he was appointed chairman, he became more involved in strategic decision-making, including establishing markets for new products, coordinating manufacturing processes and developing new partnerships with smaller companies.\n\nGrove helped create the Intel Architecture Laboratory (IAL) in Oregon to ensure that software was developed in time to take advantage of their new microprocessors. Grove stated that \"you are making decisions about what the information technology world will want five years into the future ...\" He created a culture within Intel that allowed innovation to flourish. As CEO, he wanted his managers to always encourage experimentation and prepare for changes, making a case for the value of paranoia in business. He became known for his guiding motto: \"Only the paranoid survive,\" and wrote a management book with the same title.\n\nAccording to Grove, \"Business success contains the seeds of its own destruction,\" explaining that \"Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive.\" As a result, he urges senior executives to allow people to test new techniques, new products, new sales channels, and new customers, to be ready for unexpected shifts in business or technology. Grove biographer Jeremy Byman observes that Grove \"was the one person at Intel who refused to let the company rest on its laurels.\" Grove explains his reasoning:\nIntel Senior Vice President Ron Whittier notes that Grove preferred to keep open channels of communication between employees, and encouraged people to speak their minds: \"People here aren't afraid to speak up and debate with Andy.\" They termed this style \"constructive confrontation.\" According to Grove's successor at Intel, Craig Barrett, \"It's give and take, and anyone in the company can yell at him. He's not above it.\" Grove insisted that people be demanding on one another, which fostered an atmosphere of \"ruthless intelligence.\" About that philosophy, writes business author Ken Goldstein, \"you bought into it or got your walking papers.\"\n\nGrove's office was an cubicle like the other employees, as he disliked separate \"mahogany-paneled corner offices.\" He states, \"I've been living in cubicles since 1978 — and it hasn't hurt a whole lot.\" Preferring this egalitarian atmosphere, this made his work area accessible to anyone who walked by. There were no reserved parking spaces, and Grove parked wherever there was a space. This atmosphere at work was partly a reflection of his personal life. Some who have known him, such as venture capitalist Arthur Rock, have stated that \"he has no airs.\" Grove has lived modestly without expensive cars or an airplane.\n\nGrove was noted for making sure that important details were never missed, with one of his favorite sayings being, \"The devil is in the details.\" Intel Vice President Dennis Carter states that \"Andy is very disciplined, precise, and detail oriented ... But at the same time, he has an element of intuition and creativity that is fundamental to Intel's innovation.\" According to \"Industry Week\" magazine, Grove feared that the \"brilliance that sparked the creation of Intel\" during its early years, \"might come to nothing if somebody didn't pay attention to details.\" Carter recalls that Grove would even correct his spelling errors:\nOne of the earliest investors in Google, John Doerr, called Andy Grove the \"Father of OKRs\" in Doerr's 2018 book, \"Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.\" An acronym for Objectives and Key Results, it became central to Google's culture as a \"management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization.\" The objective is the clearly-defined goal, while the key results were the specific benchmarks to ensure achievement of that goal were \"measurable and verifiable.\"\n\nIn 1975, Doerr wrote of attending a course within Intel taught by Andy Grove, where he was introduced to the theory of OKRs. Grove explained his simple but effective perspective on management: \"The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it.\"\n\nLarry Page, the CEO of Alphabet and co-founder of Google, credited OKRs within the foreword to Doerr's book: \"OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They’ve helped make our crazily bold mission of 'organizing the world’s information' perhaps even achievable. They’ve kept me and the rest of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most.\"\n\nWhile Grove naturally supported helping technology startups, he also felt that America was wrong in thinking that those new companies would increase employment. \"Startups are a wonderful thing,\" he wrote in a 2010 article for \"Bloomberg\", \"but they cannot by themselves increase tech employment.\" Although many of those startups and entrepreneurs would achieve tremendous success and wealth, said Grove, he was more concerned with the overall negative effect on America: \"What kind of a society are we going to have if it consists of highly paid people doing high-value-added work—and masses of unemployed?\"\n\nHe felt that employment growth depended on those companies' ability or willingness to scale up within the U.S. According to Grove, Silicon Valley's \"innovation machine\" over the last few decades has not been adding many jobs, although American tech companies have instead been adding jobs in Asia \"like mad.\" He noted that while our investments in startups have increased dramatically, those investments have in fact resulted in fewer jobs: \"Simply put,\" he wrote, \"the U.S. has become wildly inefficient at creating American tech jobs.\" He therefore worked to keep Intel's manufacturing in the U.S., with the company having 90,000 employees in 2010. He explained the causes and effects of many business's growth plans:\n\nTo remedy the problem, he strongly believed that \"job creation\" should become America's number 1 objective, much as it is in Asian nations. Among the methods he felt were worth considering was the imposition of a tax on imported products, with the funds received then made available to help American companies scale their operations here. However, he also accepted the fact that his ideas would be controversial: \"If what I'm suggesting sounds protectionist, so be it.\" Or that those protectionist steps could lead to conflicts with our trade partners: \"If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars—fight to win.\" He added:\nGrove was also in the minority of high-tech leaders when he advocated taxing internet sales made to other states: \"I don't think electronic commerce needs federal or state subsidies in terms of tax advantages,\" he told a Congressional committee in 2000. At the same hearing, he also expressed his opinion about internet privacy, stating that \"personal data is a form of property and it's inevitable that governments will regulate property rights.\" He said that it would be better if the federal government established its own uniform privacy standards rather than have states create a patchwork of different laws.\n\nGrove was also a noted author and scientist. His first book on semiconductors, \"Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices\" (1967), has been used by leading universities. Another book he wrote on business operation methods, \"High Output Management\" (1983), has been translated into 11 languages. He also wrote over 40 technical papers and held several patents on semiconductor devices.\n\nGrove wrote \"Only the Paranoid Survive\", a business book, whose core message is that a company in pursuit of a stronger competitive advantage never rests.\n\nHe also taught graduate computer physics courses at the University of California, Berkeley and the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nIn 2005, Grove made the largest donation that the City College of New York (CUNY) has ever received. His grant of $26 million transformed the CCNY School of Engineering into the Grove School of Engineering.\n\nGrove was also instrumental, as a key fundraiser, in establishing the University of California, San Francisco's Mission Bay Campus, the largest ongoing biomedical construction project in the world. Chancellor Sam Hawgood said that Grove's \"generous and tireless support of UCSF has transformed our university and helped accelerate our research into breakthrough treatments and better patient care.\"\n\nAmong the research facilities which he helped fund were the UCSF Prostate Cancer Center, the Helen Diller Family Cancer Research Building, and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. He also promoted general surgery initiatives and supported various obstetrics and gynecology research programs.\n\nGrove was a longtime member of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), along with being one of its overseers and a member of its board of directors. He was also the founding supporter of the IRC's Pathways to Citizenship program. In 2010, the IRC honored him as one of ten distinguished refugees. In an interview in \"Esquire\" magazine in 2000, Grove encouraged the United States to be \"vigilant as a nation to have tolerance for difference, a tolerance for new people.\" He pointed out that immigration and immigrants are what made America what it is.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He had a brother named Vlasios.\n\nBorn Theodorus Annitsalichos, his father was a teacher. Both parents died when he was very young, and he and his brother were raised by a maternal aunt. He was sent to be educated in Niğde, where he stayed with a paternal aunt who was a teacher. She, in turn, arranged for him to stay with relatives in Smyrna, while he continued his education. Besides Greek and Church Studies, he learned Armenian, Turkish and some French.\n\nWhen he was about 26 years old he went to the Monastery of the Holy Forerunner of Phlavianai in Caesarea. Later he was tonsured a monk and took the name Arsenios. Metropolitan Paisios II sent him to Pharasa and the neighbouring villages as a priest, while he was also secretly teaching the Greek language to the children of the region, at that time belonging to the Ottoman Empire. In 1870, when he was thirty years old, he was consecrated an archimandrite.\n\nAfter ordination, he went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Upon his return to Pharasa, the villagers called him Hadjiephentis. He was the respected spiritual guide of the villagers and helped the people a lot together with the mayor of Pharasa, at that time the father of Saint Paisios of Mount Athos. He was claimed to have healed sick people who came to him, Christians and Muslims. He gave Paisios his own name at baptism despite the parents' wish to name the child after a grandfather.

He is also an unofficial volunteer firefighter and was awarded the Padma Shri in 2017 for helping fight fires in the city.\n\nAs a child Ganatra would rush after fire engines when he heard them and would start helping the firemen when he reached the scene of the fire. In 1982 Ganatra, then only 12 years old, lost his elder brother Narendra to a freak fire accident which occurred when a spark fell on fuel that his brother was handling while working on a motorcycle. His brother was admitted to hospital and succumbed to his injuries a little over a month later.\n\nGanatra, originally from Gujarat, has been offering his services as a fireman in the city of Kolkata, whose firefighting force of 1,258 firemen battled some 2,000 fires in 2014 and 1,600 fires in 2015. He is an electrician by trade and earns a meager salary, borrowing from his friends to make ends meet. He also helps the police manage traffic. \n\nGanatra does not have any formal training with regards to firefighting. He started out by helping firefighters do odd jobs but now has risen to the level of a professional firefighter. Over 40 years, Ganatra has assisted in more than 100 fires, working to put out the flames, rescue victims, and clear away debris. One of his most dramatic rescues was of a pregnant woman trapped on the fifth floor of a burning building. The woman was too scared to move, so Ganatra scaled the building to reach her and convince her to come down. Ganatra has suffered injuries several times while helping put out flames, and also risked his life to extract two unexploded cylinders from a burning warehouse on Strand Road.\n\nGanatra monitors the television news constantly and informs the fire department if a fire breaks out. Despite his contributions to the force he travels to the site by himself using public transport. In recognition of his efforts, the fire department has given him a rare steel volunteer card and a khaki uniform.\n"}

He is the host of \"The Chris Gethard Show\", a talk show based in New York City that began airing in 2011 and was cancelled in 2018. He also hosts the podcast \"Beautiful Stories From Anonymous People\".\n\nGethard grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, the son of Sally and Ken Gethard, and attended West Orange High School. He is of Irish descent.\n\nGethard is an improvisational actor who works largely out of Manhattan's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. He began taking classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in 2000 while he was a student at Rutgers University. He is in the longform improvisation team The Stepfathers. He organizes a monthly show entitled \"The Nights of Our Lives\". He has also been part of the UCB Theater's national touring company. An early noted work was entitled \"Darryl\", a one-man show where he portrayed troubled baseball player Darryl Strawberry.\n\nGethard also wrote the web series \"The Most Awkward Boy in the World\" which starred fellow Stepfathers member Zach Woods.\n\nGethard was featured on Variety magazine's \"Ten Comics to Watch in 2010\" list.\n\nGethard has appeared in multiple CollegeHumor.com videos. He has also appeared on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", \"Hope and Faith\" and Comedy Central's \"Crossballs\".\n\nIn April 2010, he was tapped as the lead, alongside Horatio Sanz and Chris Parnell, in the Comedy Central sitcom \"Big Lake\". In May 2012, during the CollegeHumor All-Nighter, Gethard announced he would be opening a strawberry farm in upper New Jersey.\n\nIn 2013, the Independent Film Channel asked Gethard to write a pilot based on his book, \"A Bad Idea I'm About to Do\". IFC gave Gethard a year, in addition to writing his pilot, to market for them at festivals and produce web content.\n\nGethard released his first comedy album, \"My Comedy Album\", on April 22, 2014 on New Jersey's Don Giovanni Records.\n\nIn August 2016 Gethard participated for the first time in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, performing his show \"Career Suicide\" dealing with his experiences of depression, suicide attempts and alcoholism. During his run at the festival, he also recorded an episode of Stuart Goldsmith's \"Comedian's Comedian Podcast\", which was published in December 2016.\n\nOn May 6, 2017 HBO broadcast \"Career Suicide,\" an evening of standup comedy based on Gethard's off-Broadway show of the same title. Produced by Judd Apatow, the HBO special has garnered praise from Time Magazine, NPR, the A.V. Club, USA Today, Entertainment Weekly, The Daily Beast, Paste Magazine, The Huffington Post and Splitsider.\n\nGethard hosted \"The Chris Gethard Show\", a talkshow that originally aired on New York City public-access and was streamed around the world on Gethard's website. The show began as a live piece at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in 2009. Gethard then went to Los Angeles to pitch a network version of the show, but ended up returning to New York City to produce it for public-access because he wanted to retain the chaotic, cheap feel of early MTV talk shows. The show has since grown to consist of both stage and filmed performances. It has developed a reputation for outrageous spectacle, often featuring awkward viewer calls, high-concept group segments and Gethard subjecting himself to abuse, including an episode where he hired a kickboxer to hit him if he failed to answer simple questions about his friends. As a child, Gethard admired comedians who seemed to be able to do whatever they wanted, such as Howard Stern, Andy Kaufman, and David Letterman. This interest influenced the style of \"The Chris Gethard Show\" and Gethard's comedic persona.\n\nThe show was entirely self-funded and none of the performers were paid for their time during its public access time. Though this largely surfaced as result of the style of Upright Citizens Brigade shows and the aesthetic of the show, Gethard had stated that he would not be opposed to the show being picked up by a television network. He met with a number of network producers, but the show was not picked up, the primary concern being its unpredictable nature and frequent swearing. In early 2014, Comedy Central ordered a pilot from TCGS, to be co-produced by Funny or Die, leading to a brief hiatus from the weekly program. The pilot was taped, but ultimately not picked up by Comedy Central. The show returned to MNN from April to January 2015. In its final MNN episode it was announced that the show had been picked up by Fusion, where it ran for two seasons.\n\nThroughout the show's many manifestations, it has attracted a number of celebrity guests including P. Diddy, Amy Poehler, Will Ferrell, Paul Giamatti, and Lena Dunham.\n\nAfter its run on Fusion, \"The Chris Gethard Show\" was picked up for a third season by truTV, and began airing live episodes in August 2017. In August 2018, Chris Gethard announced the show had been canceled and would not return for another season.\n\nGethard is currently the host of Earwolf's podcast \"Beautiful/Anonymous\", which first aired on March 15, 2016. The following is Earwolf's description of the show: \"1 phone call. 1 hour. No names. No holds barred. That’s the premise behind \"Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People\", hosted by comedian Chris Gethard...Every week, Chris opens the phone line to one anonymous caller, and he can’t hang up first, no matter what. From shocking confessions and family secrets to philosophical discussions and shameless self-promotion, anything can and will happen!\"\n\nGethard co-hosted Earwolf's podcast, \"In Your Dreams\", with Gary Richardson. The podcast first aired on December 12, 2016 with special guest comedian Aparna Nancherla, and the ninth and final episode aired on February 6, 2017.\n\nGethard is also the author of \"Weird NY\", a book detailing the ghost stories and urban legends of New York City, and \"A Bad Idea I'm About to Do\", a collection of stories from Gethard's life, which has been highlighted on This American Life. Previously, Gethard served as an editorial assistant for the popular \"Weird NJ\" and \"Weird US\" publications.\n\nGethard hitchhiked from Los Angeles to Bonnaroo (Tennessee) relying only on the good will of others to help him. He has a series of YouTube videos that document his trip. The videos include trips in vans and driving a firetruck.\n\n\"The Chris Gethard Show\" is well known for its audience interaction. One show featured a woman calling in to inquire about the purpose of the show. Gethard invited her to join them and she became a regular for four months. After this the notion of random, unknown fans becoming regular cast members became popular. The show continued this trend through its public access run, having a new \"random\" as a cast member for 15 episodes.\n\nGethard married Hallie Bulleit, band leader for \"The Chris Gethard Show\", on August 30, 2014 in Brooklyn, New York. The service was performed by fellow \"Chris Gethard Show\" cast member, Murf Meyer.\n\nHe is an avid fan of The Smiths and has two tattoos related to the band—Morrissey's signature on his right shoulder (based on an actual signature he got in marker on his arm), and \"It takes strength to be gentle and kind,\" a lyric from \"I Know It's Over,\" on his right biceps.\n\n\n"}

He is perhaps best known for his 1964 performance at the Newport Folk Festival with Gladius Thibodeaux and Vinus LeJeune, where the group received an enthusiastic response from over seventeen thousand audience members. He sang the song \"Parlez Nous à Boire\" in the 1981 cult film \"Southern Comfort\", in which he had a small role.\n\nDewey Balfa was born in Grand Louis, Louisiana, a small community west of Mamou.

In one scene, Balfa is shown with Nathan Abshire entertaining a group of school children. Balfa gives a short lecture concerning the origins of Cajun music:\n\n\"We are here to tell you a little bit about what a Cajun is. A Cajun is a person who his homeland was France. Went into Nova Scotia, at the time Acadia, and settled there and was there for about a hundred years, and afterwards the British took over the territory and then the French-speaking people, the French descendants, known as the Acadians, came down to the South-Western part of Louisiana, and that was back in 1755. So over all of these years, your language, and your music has been preserved from daddy to son or daddy to daughter or momma to daughter.\"\n\n\n\nSelected Filmography\n\n\n"}

His brother Carlos Gutíerrez Menoyo died in the [Presidential Palace Attack of March 13, 1957.\nGutiérrez Menoyo came from a Spanish family active in the Spanish Civil War and emigrated to Cuba following the victory of Francisco Franco′s forces with his family in 1945.\n\nIn Cuba in 1957, Eloy formed and commanded the rebel group Second National Front of Escambray, which fought against president Batista′s dictatorial rule alongside Fidel Castro′s 26 July Revolutionary Movement and the 13th of March Revolutionary Student Directorate. In March 1957, he and his brother, Carlos, were part of an attack on the Presidential Palace of Fulgencio Batista; his brother, Carlos, was killed in that attack. On January 3 of 1959, Eloy and his troops entered the City of Havana, Cuba and few days before Fidel Castro did and Eloy was hailed as one of the \"Commanders Of The Revolution\". Eloy's own army was absorbed into the army of Fidel Castro but Eloy was permitted to retain the rank of 'Major' which was the highest rank in Cuba at the time. However, Eloy and many of his senior officers were never offered a post in the Castro Administration. While being on the outside and looking in, Eloy grew dissatisfied with the Castro Administration and in September–October 1959, Eloy and some of his men from the old 1st Version of the Second National Front - which was formed in 1957 as a pro-Castro group - now form the 2nd Version of the Second National Front - which was an anti-Castro group.\n\nHowever, in January 1961, events took a turn against these anti-Castro 2nd Version members and now Eloy and about 12 military and civilian supporters took to a boat and fled to the USA. Eloy would settle in the City of Miami, Florida. While in Florida, Eloy helped form Alpha 66. Formed in January–February 1962, Alpha 66 was created just too late to take part in April 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion.\n\nHowever, after the death of John F.

Henry's father Alexander, a Yale University graduate, was a descendant of Captain Nicolas Martiau, the French Huguenot settler of Jamestown, Virginia and ancestor of President George Washington. Alexander was also an officer on Brig. Gen. John Coffee's staff during the Creek War of 1813 and 1814 in Alabama; his mother was a daughter of a prominent Virginia planter. The family had been wealthy, politically influential, and socially prominent in North Carolina before the American Revolution, but Alexander McCulloch had wasted much of his inheritance and was unable even to educate his sons. (Two of Henry McCulloch's older brothers briefly attended a school in Tennessee taught by their neighbor, Sam Houston.) After several moves, the family settled at Dyersburg, where one of their closest neighbors was David Crockett—a great influence on both McCulloch and his older brother, Ben McCulloch, who also would become a Confederate brigadier general.\n\nHenry McCulloch shared in his brother Ben's economic attempts in the 1830s, including transporting goods by raft on the Mississippi, once all the way to New Orleans. When Davy Crockett went to Texas in 1835, Henry McCulloch and his brother made plans to meet Crockett's Tennessee Boys at Nacogdoches on Christmas Day. However, Ben contracted measles and was bedridden for several weeks and while ill convinced his brother Henry to return to Tennessee in November 1835. Luckily, the illness kept them from arriving with Crockett at the Alamo.\n\nIn 1838, both Henry and Ben McCulloch were making a living as surveyors. They also made a reputations as Indian fighters. Both took part in the Battle Creek Fight against the Comanche Indians in Navarro County, also known as \"The Surveyors' Fight\". In 1839, Henry McCulloch was on the muster roll of Capt. Mathew Caldwell's \"Gonzales Rangers\". Also in 1839, Ben was elected to the Republic of Texas House of Representatives after a contentious campaign that included assorted slanders between the candidates. As a result, Ben fought a rifle duel with his opponent, Reuben Ross and received a permanently crippling wound in the arm. The matter was considered closed but it flared up again the following year, this time involving Henry, who killed Ross with a pistol.\n\nOn August 20, 1840, McCulloch married Jane Isabella Ashby, daughter of John Miller Ashby and Mary Harris Garnett of Kentucky, who had been early settlers in the DeWitt Colony, which was centered on Gonzales. They had twelve children, most of whom remained in Texas.\n\nLater in 1840, McCulloch took part in the Battle of Plum Creek, acting as a scout against the Comanches and being wounded. When a Mexican raiding force under Gen. Adrian Woll invested San Antonio in September 1842, he served as First Lieutenant of a company of volunteers from Seguin. He again operated as a scout, including infiltrating enemy lines, and commanded a spy company at the Battle of Salado Creek. With his brother, Ben, he subsequently took part in the failed Somervell expedition and both men were ordered to leave shortly before most of the Texans were captured at Mier, Mexico in Tamaulipas, December 25, 1842.\n\nHe was elected sheriff of Gonzales in 1843 and also opened a mercantile business there. The following year, he moved his family permanently to Seguin.\n\nThere are several letters written in the 1890s (now in the possession of the Texas State Library) in which McCulloch describes his (and his brother's) activities during the Texas Revolution and under the Republic.\n\nIn December 1847, McCulloch was in command of a Ranger company in Burnet County and established what became Fort Croghan. When the War with Mexico began, he took command of a volunteer company patrolling the same area of the western frontier against Indian raids. He continued this service after the war as captain of a company of Texas Mounted Volunteers out of Fort Murrill, and also operating a Ranger post in Kimble County.\n\nA few days after the convention voted for secession from the union on February 1, 1861 (though before the necessary referendum), the Texas Committee of Public Safety established a Provisional Army, in which McCulloch received a commission as colonel. On March 4, he was appointed commander of the 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment, also known (especially to its officers) as the 1st Texas Mounted Rifles. The unit was recruited from several counties in central Texas to serve for twelve months and was the first Texas cavalry regiment to enter Confederate service. Its mission was to maintain a line of patrol from the Red River southwest to the junction of the Concho and North Concho Rivers, a point near present-day San Angelo.\n\nMcCulloch was acknowledged by his superiors and others for his emphasis on precise discipline and gentlemanly conduct in his regiment. His training methods included complex cavalry and infantry maneuvers as well as sabre-fighting and the proper care of horses and equipment. Many Texas units maintained only lax rules of propriety and organization, but the 1st Texas remained a cohesive and loyal unit, disbanding only under the proper orders.\n\nAfter receiving word of the action at Fort Sumter, McCulloch moved five companies to confront any federal troops remaining in Texas who had not yet embarked at the port of Indianola, but en route he received orders from Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to intercept a federal force northwest of San Antonio. On May 9, McCulloch's troops, numbering some 1,300, captured the 8th U.S. Infantry near San Lucas Springs.\n\nLate in June, McCulloch crossed the Red River with Maj. Edward Burleson to ensure the friendliness (or at least the neutrality) of the Wichita and Caddo Indians, following this with a warning that any raids across the river into Texas would bring retaliation—and over the following year, there were in fact a number of engagements between elements of the 1st Texas and Indian raiding parties. The success of the Texas troops in suppressing these raids is shown in the fact that the number of raids actually decreased during 1861 and 1862 from the numbers reported in previous years.\n\nIn September 1861, McCulloch, now a brigadier general, assumed temporary command of the Department of Texas until the arrival of Brig. Gen. Paul O. Hébert, and in December was named to command the new Western Military District, comprising that part of the state west and south of San Antonio. Early the next year, he was ordered to assume co-command of Texas State Troops being sent to Arkansas.\n\nOn September 6, 1862, following the death near Little Rock of his co-commander, Allison Nelson of Waco, McCulloch took command of the new Texas Division and organized it into four brigades, ultimately taking command of the Third Brigade himself while the division as a whole was under the command of Maj. Gen. John G. Walker. The division was attached to the District of Arkansas, Trans-Mississippi Department, and by April 1863 it was in Louisiana, where it took part in the Red River Campaign, the Camden Expedition, and the Battle of Milliken's Bend, which was an early phase of the Vicksburg campaign. In July 1863, the division arrived in Alexandria, Louisiana, where McCulloch was replaced by Col. George M. Flournoy. McCulloch was approached as a candidate for governor of Texas late that summer, but declined in order to remain on active service.\n\nIn 1864 and 1865, McCulloch was again in north Texas and in charge of the Western Sub-District of Texas (the entire District now being under the command of Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder), where he was active not only in dealing with Indian raids but in pursuing and arresting Confederate deserters and bushwhackers. At the end of the war, on his return to his home in Seguin, he found it necessary to travel with an armed escort because of threats against his life by deserters.\n\nIn 1874, he was active early in the administration of Gov. Richard Coke, especially in helping to physically remove Edmund J. Davis from the executive offices. In 1876, as a reward for his services to Texas, he was appointed superintendent of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum (later the Texas School for the Deaf) in Austin. Though a respected military commander, he proved an inept civil administrator and a legislative investigation forced him to resign his position in 1879; he was succeeded in that office by Col. John S. \"Rip\" Ford, his old commander in the Rangers.\n\nThe retired general apparently enjoyed his retirement, frequently receiving distinguished visitors in his home, giving interviews and engaging in correspondence with inquiring historical writers, and was in regular demand as a speaker at July Fourth festivities throughout central Texas. He was also a trustee in the local Methodist Church. Henry E. McCulloch died March 12, 1895 at Rockport, Texas and was buried in San Geronimo Cemetery in Seguin. He received a full masonic funeral, having been an active freemason after the War in the Guadalupe County lodge. His widow, Jane Ashby McCulloch died in 1896.\n\nCamp Henry McCulloch was located at \"Nuner's Mott\", about four miles north of the present city limits of Victoria in Victoria County. It was the training site in the fall of 1861 for several infantry and cavalry companies of the 6th Texas Infantry Regiment, CSA (at the time when McCulloch was interim commander of the Department of Texas). A Texas state historical marker was erected at the site.\n\nThe Gen. Henry E. McCulloch Camp #843 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Texas Division, Central Texas Brigade, is located in Brownwood, Texas.\n\nHis wife, Jane Isabella Ashby McCulloch, was a sister of Sarah Ashby McClure and Euphemia Ashby King, two of the main characters Janice Woods Windle's historical novel \"True Women\", which was made into a TV movie.\n\n\n\n"}

The population of Indonesia according to the 2010 national census was 237.64 million, and it was estimated to reach 255.4 million in 2015. 51% live on the island of Java, the world's most populous island. Around 95% of Indonesians are Native Indonesians (formerly grouped as \"Pribumi\"), with Javanese forming the majority, while the other 5% are Indonesians with ancestry from foreign origin, such as Chinese Indonesians.\n\nAs of 2018, Indonesians make up 3.5% of world total population, and Indonesia is the fourth most populous country after China, India and the United States.\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since the 1967, for the decade ending in 2010, Indonesia's population growth was 1.49 percent. At that rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the present population of the United States and would - if the current US population did not rise - become the world's third biggest after China and India by 2043. The family planning already revitalised based on the 1967 program to avoid Indonesia becoming the world's third most populous country.\n\nWith a population of 150 million, Java is home to 51 percent of the Indonesian population, and is the most populous island on Earth. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the centre of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.\n\nOther major island of Indonesia are Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Papua that take other 49 percent of Indonesian population. There are also other small populated island(s) such as Bali, Bangka, Madura, Nias, Maluku, Lesser Sunda Islands, Riau Islands and others.\n\nThere are over 300 ethnic groups in Indonesia. 95% of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry.\n\nThe largest ethnic group in Indonesia is the Javanese who make up nearly 51% of the total population. The Javanese are concentrated on the island of Java but millions have migrated to other islands throughout the archipelago because of the transmigration program. The Sundanese, Malay, and Madurese are the next largest groups in the country. Many ethnic groups, particularly in Kalimantan and Papua, have only hundreds of members. Most of the local languages belong to Austronesian language family, although a significant number, particularly in Maluku Islands and West Papua belong to Papuan languages. The Chinese Indonesians population makes up a little less than 1% of the total Indonesian population according to the 2000 census. Some of these Indonesians of Chinese descent speak various Chinese dialects, most notably Hokkien and Hakka.\n\nThe classification of ethnic groups in Indonesia is not rigid and in some cases unclear due to migrations, cultural and linguistic influences; for example some may consider Bantenese and Cirebonese to be members of Javanese people, however some others argue that they are different ethnic groups altogether since they have their own distinct dialects. This is the same case with Baduy people that share many cultural similarities with the Sundanese people. An example of hybrid ethnicity is the Betawi people, descended not only from marriages between different peoples in Indonesia but also with foreign origin like Arab, Chinese and Indian migrants since the era of colonial Batavia (Jakarta).\n\nThe Indonesian language (\"bahasa Indonesia\" ) is the official language of Indonesia. It is a standardized register of Malay, an Austronesian language that has been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries. Most Indonesians also speak one of more than 700 indigenous languages.\n\nMost Indonesians, aside from speaking the national language, are fluent in another regional language (examples include Javanese, Sundanese and others), which are commonly used at home and within the local community. Most formal education, and nearly all national media and other forms of communication, are conducted in Indonesian. In East Timor, which was an Indonesian province from 1975 to 1999, Indonesian is recognised by the constitution as one of the two working languages (the other being English), alongside the official languages of Tetum and Portuguese.\n\nIndonesia is constitutionally a secular state and the first principle of Indonesia's philosophical foundation, Pancasila, is \"belief in the one and only God\". A number of different religions are practised in the country, and their collective influence on the country's political, economic and cultural life is significant. The Indonesian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. However, the government recognises only six official religions (Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism). Although based on data collected by the Indonesian Conference on Religion and Peace (ICRP), there are about 245 non-official religions in Indonesia. Indonesian law requires that every Indonesian citizen hold an identity card that identifies that person with one of these six religions, although citizens may be able to leave that section blank. Indonesia does not recognise agnosticism or atheism, and blasphemy is illegal. In the 2010 Indonesian census, 87.18% of Indonesians identified themselves as Muslim (with Sunnis more than 99%, Shias 0.5%, Ahmadis 0.2%), 6.96% Protestant, 2.91% Catholic, 1.69% Hindu, 0.72% Buddhist, 0.05% Confucianism, 0.13% other, and 0.38% unstated or not asked.\n\nIndonesia's political leadership has played an important role in the relations between groups, both positively and negatively, promoting mutual respect by affirming Pancasila but also promoting a Transmigration Program, which has caused a number of conflicts in the eastern region of the country.\n\nIndonesian literature can refer to literature produced in the Indonesian archipelago. It is also used to refer more broadly to literature produced in areas with common language roots based on the Malay language (of which Indonesian is one scion). This would extend the reach to the Maritime Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, but also other nations with a common language such as Malaysia and Brunei, as well as population within other nations such as the Malay people living in Singapore.\n\nThere are also works written in and about Indonesia in unrelated languages. There are several languages and several distinct but related literary traditions within the geographical boundaries of the modern nation of Indonesia. For example, the island of Java has its own Javanese pre-national cultural and literary history. There are also Sundanese, Balinese, and Batak or Madurese traditions. Indonesia also has a colonial history of Dutch, British and Japanese occupation, as well as a history of Islamic influence that brought its own texts, linguistic and literary influences. There is also an \"oral literature\" tradition in the area.\n\nThe phrase Indonesian literature is used in this article to refer to Indonesian as written in the nation of Indonesia, but also covers literature written in an earlier form of the Indonesian language i.e. Malay language written in the Dutch East Indies.\n\nThe Architecture of Indonesia reflects the diversity of cultural, historical and geographic influences that have shaped Indonesia as a whole. Invaders, colonizers, missionaries, merchants and traders brought cultural changes that had a profound effect on building styles and techniques.\n\nTraditionally, the most significant foreign influence has been Indian. However, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also played significant roles in shaping Indonesian architecture. Religious architecture varies from indigenous forms to mosques, temples, and churches. The sultans and other rulers built palaces. There is a substantial legacy of colonial architecture in Indonesian cities. Independent Indonesia has seen the development of new paradigms for postmodern and contemporary architecture.\n\nIndonesian cuisine is one of the most vibrant and colourful cuisines in the world, full of intense flavor. It is diverse, in part because Indonesia is composed of approximately 6,000 populated islands of the total 18,000 in the world's largest archipelago, with more than 300 ethnic groups calling Indonesia their home. Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences. Indonesia has around 5,350 traditional recipes, with 30 of them considered the most important.\n\nIndonesian cuisine varies greatly by region and has many different influences. Sumatran cuisine, for example, often has Middle Eastern and Indian influences, featuring curried meat and vegetables such as \"gulai\" and \"kari\", while Javanese cuisine is mostly indigenous, with some hint of Chinese influence. The cuisines of Eastern Indonesia are similar to Polynesian and Melanesian cuisine. Elements of Chinese cuisine can be seen in Indonesian cuisine: foods such as \"bakmi\" (noodles), \"bakso\" (meat or fish balls), and \"lumpia\" (spring rolls) have been completely assimilated.\n\nThe skin colour of Indonesian people ranges from fair skin with yellowish undertone to light brown to very dark brown or black skin colour. \n\nWriting in 1985, Archaeologist Peter Bellwood noted several theories for Indonesian ancestory including \"Australo-Melanesian and Mongoloid Evolution\". the \"Southern Mongoloid Replacement Model\" and the \"Indo-Malaysian Continuity Model\" concluding that \"research still has a long way to go in this region\".\n\nMost Indonesian people are genetically close to Asians while the more eastern one goes how more people show Melanesian affinity. Geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza claims that there is a genetic division between East and Southeast Asians. In a like manner, Zhou Jixu agrees that there is a physical difference between these two populations. Other geneticists have found evidence for four separate populations, carrying distinct sets of non-recombining Y chromosome lineages, within the traditional Mongoloid category: North Asians, Han Chinese, Japanese and Southeast Asians. The complexity of genetic data has led to doubt about the usefulness of the concept of a Mongoloid race itself, since distinctive East Asian features may represent separate lineages and arise from environmental adaptations or retention of common proto-Eurasian ancestral characteristics.\n\nNon-indigenous Indonesians:\n"}

Iwasaki began his career as an employee of the Tosa clan. The clan had business interests in many parts of Japan.\n\nIwasaki left for Edo (now Tokyo) aged nineteen for his education. He interrupted his studies a year later when his father was seriously injured in a dispute with the village headman. When the local magistrate refused to hear his case, Iwasaki accused him of corruption. Iwasaki was sent to prison for seven months. After his release, Iwasaki was without a job for a time before finding work as a teacher.\n\nReturning to Edo, he socialised with political activists and studied under the reformist Yoshida Toyo, who influenced him with ideas of opening and developing the then-closed nation through industry and foreign trade. Through Yoshida, he found work as a clerk for the Tosa government, and bought back his family's samurai status. He was promoted to the top position at the Tosa clan's trading office in Nagasaki, responsible for trading camphor oil and paper to buy ships, weapons, and ammunition.\n\nFollowing the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which forced the disbandment of the shogunate's business interests, Iwasaki travelled to Osaka and leased the trading rights for the Tosa clan's Tsukumo Trading Company. The company changed its name to Mitsubishi in 1873.\n\nIwasaki became president of Mitsubishi in March 1870. The name Mitsubishi is a compound of \"mitsu\" (\"three\") and \"hishi\" (literally, \"water chestnut\", often used in Japanese to denote a diamond or rhombus). Its emblem was a combination of the Iwasaki family crest, showing three overlapping lozenges, and the crest with three oak leaves, arranged in a threefold rotational symmetry, of the Yamauchi family, who were leaders of the Tosa clan, which controlled the part of Shikoku where Yatarō was born.\n\nIn 1874–1875, Iwasaki was contracted by the Japanese government to transport Japanese soldiers and war materials. The Japanese government purchased a number of ships for the Japanese Expedition of 1874 to Taiwan against Paiwan Aborigines in southeast Taiwan, and these ships were later given to Mitsubishi after the expedition was finished in 1875. This created strong links between Mitsubishi and the Japanese government that ensured the new company's success. In return, Mitsubishi supported the new Japanese government and transported troops who defeated the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877. Thus the success of Mitsubishi became intertwined with the rise of the modern Japanese state. \n\nSubsequently he invested in mining, ship repair, and finance. In 1884 he took a lease on the Nagasaki Shipyard, which allowed the company to undertake shipbuilding on a large scale, and renamed it Nagasaki Shipyard & Machinery Works.\n\nIwasaki Yatarō often gave dinners for dignitaries, spending a huge amount of money on these occasions, but he also made many friends who later helped him by doing favors.\n\nIwasaki died of stomach cancer aged 50, and was succeeded as the head of the family business first by his brother, and later his son, Hisaya.\n\nIwasaki serves as the secondary protagonist of the 49th NHK Taiga drama, \"Ryōmaden\", focusing on his activities during the Bakumatsu, and also serves as the framing narrator of the story. He is portrayed by Teruyuki Kagawa.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "733315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=733315", "title": "Ka-Zar (comics)", "text": "Ka-Zar (comics)\n\nKa-Zar ( ) is the name of two jungle-dwelling fictional comic book characters published in the United States. The first Ka-Zar was named David Rand, and debuted in 1936, first appearing in pulp magazines of the 1930s. In 1939 he was adapted for his second iteration, a comic book character for Timely Comics, the 1930s and 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. The second and more prominent Ka-Zar was named Kevin Plunder, and first appeared in 1965. He is a heroic character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nThe second Ka-Zar started as a similar character, but reminiscent of both Tarzan and of writer-artist Joe Kubert's 1950s caveman character, Tor. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in \"The X-Men\" #10 (March 1965), he lives in the dinosaur-populated Savage Land, which was hidden beneath Antarctica by extraterrestrials. The character was based on his pulp magazine namesake only to the extent that he used the same name and rough \"jungle lord\" concept, and Lee has admitted that he had never even read any of the original Ka-Zar stories.\n\nOriginally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the \"Lord of the Savage Land,\" a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.\n\nKa-Zar's first solo story was published in \"Marvel Super-Heroes\" #19 (1969), and the character had features in the black-and-white magazine \"Savage Tales\" and the color title \"Astonishing Tales\". He has had five self-titled series, the first published in 1970–1971 (three issues, mostly reprints), the second, which continued the storyline from \"Astonishing Tales\", in 1974-1977 (20 issues, subtitled \"Lord of the Hidden Jungle\") by Mike Friedrich, Gerry Conway, and Doug Moench, the third in 1981-1984, \"Ka-Zar the Savage\", (34 issues) by Bruce Jones and Mike Carlin, the fourth in 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by Mark Waid and the fifth in 2011 (5 issue miniseries) written by Paul Jenkins.\n\nKa-Zar is Kevin Reginald, Lord Plunder, born in Castle Plunder, Kentish Town, London, England. He is the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the English nobleman who discovered the Savage Land. After his mother had died and his father was killed by the barbaric Man-Ape natives of the Savage Land, Plunder was found and raised by the sabertooth tiger Zabu, who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a mutation caused by radioactive mists. \"Ka-Zar\" means \"Son of the Tiger\" in the language of the Man-Apes. Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners. Ka-Zar became an expert hunter, trapper, and fisherman, living off the wild land.\n\nIn the Savage Land, some territories are populated by several human or humanoid tribes, and while most of them are on friendly terms with Ka-Zar, some of them consider him an outlander and an enemy. He acts more like an unofficial general protector, preventing outside commercial exploitation, such as poaching and mining, as well as enforcing peace between tribes and serving as goodwill ambassador to friendly visitors.\n\nThe original X-Men discovered the Savage Land, and Ka-Zar encountered them, battling Maa-Gor for the first time. He then encountered Daredevil for the first time, and battled his brother Parnival, who had become the supervillain called the Plunderer. He first battled Magneto's Savage Land Mutates alongside the X-Men. He then encountered the Hulk for the first time, and battled Umbu the Unliving. He was once 'tricked' into confronting Spider-Man after J. Jonah Jameson convinced him that Spider-Man was a menace when the wall-crawler's memory was erased and he was tricked into working with Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man's memory was restored during the fight, with Ka-Zar subsequently apologizing for the mistake and proclaiming Spider-Man as the most valiant opponent he had ever fought. Ka-Zar then battled Kraven the Hunter for the first time. Shortly after this encounter, Ka-Zar encounters Zaladane and Garokk for the first time.\n\nAfter the Savage Land became known to outsiders after the visit by the X-Men, many people began traveling to the territory. Ka-Zar has also become romantically involved with female visitors, the first being S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Barbara Morse (who later became the Avenger named Mockingbird). He first battled A.I.M., and met the Man-Thing. He then met Spider-Man once again, and battled the extraterrestrial Gog. He next met the adventurer Shanna O'Hara. He battled Klaw, and visited other dimensions. He and his allies faded mysteriously from that other dimension, then teamed with the X-Men to battle Zaladane and a reborn Garokk.\n\nKa-Zar, during a search for the lost Zabu, later discovered Pangaea, an ancient refuge created by the Atlanteans. Ka-Zar and Shanna began to gradually fall in love. He then battles Belasco for the first time. After a meeting with A.I.M. spies disguised as scientists, Ka-Zar is shot in the head, but survives. He is flown to New York City, but escapes the plane at Kennedy Airport. With no memory and no ability to speak, he wanders New York, saving lives and fighting crime. His memory returns and he encounters Kraven The Hunter again, who has been released from prison by an A.I.M. agent to capture him. Saved by Shanna and Spider-Man, he is brought to the hospital where A.I.M. fakes his death in order to use him in a scheme. Escaping with Spider-Man's aid, he and Shanna return to the Savage Land. He later marries Shanna, who has taken the name Shanna the She-Devil. During the ceremony, a war (incited by the machinations of Belasco) breaks out in Pangea, which ends when Ka-Zar and Shanna are banished. His brother Parnival arrived in the Savage Land, searching for anti-metal Vibranium, and was apparently killed during his scheme (though much later turned up alive). During this scheme, a Nuwali transport device is uncovered, and Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu are transported to the Nuwali planet. The Nuwali use human adrenalin to poison their rivals, and also reveal to Shanna that she is pregnant.\n\nKa-Zar has teamed up with several of Marvel's heroes. The X-Men are recurrent visitors to the Savage Land and Ka-Zar has been a frequent ally, helping the mutant team defeat both inside and outside menaces such as Sauron and Magneto. He has met Spider-Man on several occasions, one of which involved stopping Stegron the Dinosaur Man from invading New York City with Savage Land dinosaurs. Ka-Zar has also assisted the Avengers in their attempt to repel the space conqueror Terminus, but while they rescued many natives, they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land. Ka-Zar was rescued by the Avengers, but left the Savage Land for the civilized world. Together, he and Shanna had a son named Matthew. The territory was later reconstructed by the High Evolutionary using Garokk, and Ka-Zar and Shanna returned with their newborn and resumed their previous roles.\n\nKa-Zar and Shanna separated for a time, but got back together before long. Ka-Zar fought and defeated Thanos in one of his many attempts to end life, and later sought the help of investigator Jessica Jones for assistance locating Zabu.\n\nShanna and Ka-Zar find Skrulls mining the rare metal vibranium in the Savage Land. Soon afterward as part of the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, a Skrull ship crashes in the Savage Land releasing earlier versions of modern superheroes (who claim to be the originals replaced by Skrulls for some time), and who have escaped. Shanna and Ka-Zar soon learn, however, that these are simply more Skrulls in disguise. Spider-Man soon encounters Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and some of the natives accusing them of being Skrulls. Just then, the Captain America from the ship attacked thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight the Captain America from the ship until it is hit by a dart that causes it to regress to a Skrull named Pit'o Nilli. He then later goes with the rest of the Avengers to New York City to help them fight off the Skrull invasion while Shanna stays behind with Zabu to fight off anymore Skrulls left in the Savage Land.\n\nKa-Zar later meets Reptil when he and Tigra have rescued Moon-Boy. After reuniting Moon-Boy with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.\n\nKa-Zar and Shanna later encounter the return of the Ethereals and end up fighting them when it comes to the Ethereals wanting the tribes of the Savage Land to be united with them.\n\nHe later teams with Skaar to protect the Savage Land from outside forces.\n\nKevin Plunder is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He utilizes a unique style of hand-to-hand combat shaped by years of surviving in the Savage Land. He has developed great skills in hunting, trapping, fishing, foraging, and general survival in the wild. He carries a Bowie knife, and occasionally uses a sling, bow and arrow, and other primitive weapons. He can also communicate with some animals.\n\nIt was revealed in \"Astonishing Tales\" #11, scripted by Roy Thomas, that Ka-Zar's and Zabu's physical abilities had been enhanced by passing through some mysterious mist. The mists later endowed other characters (Maa-Gor and El Tigre) with superhuman abilities.\n\nIn the \"Age of Ultron\" story, Ka-Zar was present in the Savage Land when the hero resistance against Ultron was relocated to the Savage Land. Ka-Zar leads them to a refuge area where they can formulate their next plan.\n\nA version of Kevin Plunder, named Kavin Plundarr, is Gotowar Konanegg a Captain Britain Corps member who featured in \"Mighty World Of Marvel\" vol. 2 #13 (1984).\n\nIn the \"Earth X\" series, Ka-Zar (as well as Shanna) have been mutated by Plague X into humanoid saber-toothed tigers. They play an integral part in \"Universe X\"- leading Captain America and the reborn Mar-Vell to the gateway to Limbo, and helping the X-Men and Wakandan refugees escape the cannibalistic hordes of Wendigo.\n\nHe appears in a What If story, where the Savage Land terraforming has taken over New York. He has a son, Matthew, but is appears that Zabu has been killed as his skull is seen on Ka-Zar's head and his pelt, a cape. Both he and Parnival sacrifice themselves to return New York to normal, with Shanna the only survivor of his \"family.\"\n\nIn the \"House of M\" reality, Kevin Plunder appears in a short article in \"The Pulse: House of M Special Edition\". The article explains that he has been granted asylum in the US and feature a picture of him alongside his faithful companion Zabu.\n\nIt is briefly noted in Marvel Zombies that a zombified Quicksilver managed to spread the virus to the Savage Land, infecting Ka-Zar and Zabu.\n\nKa-Zar appears in his Ultimate form on the final page of issue #3 of \"\", along with Ultimate Shanna. After the Ultimatum wave, they join the New Ultimates where they help to fight Loki.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Geddon\" storyline, there is a version of Ka-Zar who has traits that are amalgamated with Kraven the Hunter named Ka-Zar the Hunter. He is seen with Wilson Fisk when they are in the Savage Land poaching dinosaurs. It was mentioned by Ka-Zar that his father killed the last of the Man-Apes. He unknowingly sets off one of Savage Spider-Man's traps that nearly crushes Ka-Zar the Hunter who pushes Fisk out of the way.\n\n\n\n\nIGN listed Ka-Zar as the 84th-greatest comic book hero of all time, describing the character as Marvel's equivalent of Tarzan; IGN also compared Ka-Zar as the protector of his land with Namor being protector of the underwater king, with the only differences being that Ka-Zar isn't a total jerk and has a better loin cloth.\n\n"}

{"id": "211628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=211628", "title": "Kazakhs", "text": "Kazakhs\n\nThe Kazakhs (also spelled Kazaks, Qazaqs; , , , ; the English name is transliterated from Russian) are a Turkic people who mainly inhabit the southern part of Eastern Europe and the Ural mountains and northern parts of Central Asia (largely Kazakhstan, but also parts of Uzbekistan, China, Russia and Mongolia), the region also known as the Eurasian sub-continent. Kazakh identity is of medieval origin and was strongly shaped by the foundation of the Kazakh Khanate between 1456 and 1465, when several tribes under the rule of the sultans Zhanibek and Kerey departed from the Khanate of Abu'l-Khayr Khan.\n\nThe Kazakhs are descendants of the Turkic and medieval Mongol tribes – Argyns, Dughlats, Naimans, Jalairs, Keraits, Khazars, Qarluqs; and of the Kipchaks and Cumans, and other tribes such as the Huns and Nogais, and ancient Iranian nomads like the Sarmatians, Saka and Scythians who populated the territory between Siberia and the Black Sea before the 5th and 13th centuries AD.\n\nThe Kazakhs probably began using this name during either the 15th or 16th century. There are many theories on the origin of the word Kazakh or Qazaq. Some speculate that it comes from the Turkish verb ' (\"to wander\"), because the Kazakhs were wandering steppemen; or that it derives from the Proto-Turkic word ' (a wheeled cart used by the Kazakhs to transport their yurts and belongings).\n\nAnother theory on the origin of the word Kazakh (originally ') is that it comes from the ancient Turkic word ', first mentioned on the 8th century Turkic monument of Uyuk-Turan. According to the notable Turkic linguist Vasily Radlov and the orientalist Veniamin Yudin, the noun ' derives from the same root as the verb ' (\"to obtain\", \"to gain\"). Therefore, \"\" defines a type of person who seeks profit and gain.\n\nKazakh was a common term throughout medieval Central Asia, generally with regard to individuals or groups who had taken or achieved independence from a figure of authority. Timur described his own youth without directory authority as his (\"Qazaq-ness\"). At the time of the Uzbek nomads' Conquest of Central Asia, the Uzbek Abu'l-Khayr Khan had differences with the Chinggisid chiefs Giray/Kirey and Janibeg/Janibek, descendants of Urus Khan. \n\nThese differences probably resulted from the crushing defeat of Abu'l-Khayr Khan at the hands of the Qalmaqs. Kirey and Janibek moved with a large following of nomads to the region of Zhetysu/Semirechye on the border of Moghulistan and set up new pastures there with the blessing of the Moghul Chingisid Esen Buqa, who hoped for a buffer zone of protection against the expansion of the Oirats. It is not explicitly explained that this is why the later Kazakhs took the name permanently, but it is the only historically verifiable source of the ethnonym. The group under Kirey and Janibek are called in various sources Qazaqs and Uzbek-Qazaqs (those independent of the Uzbek khans). The Russians originally called the Kazakhs 'Kirgiz' and later Kirghiz-Kaisak to distinguish them from the Kyrgyz proper.\n\nIn the 17th century, Russian convention seeking to distinguish the Qazaqs of the steppes from the Cossacks of the Imperial Russian Army suggested spelling the final consonant with \"kh\" instead of \"q\" or \"k\", which was officially adopted by the USSR in 1936.\n\nThe Russian term Cossack probably comes from the same Kypchak etymological root: wanderer, brigand, independent free-booter.\n\nDue to their nomadic pastoral lifestyle, Kazakhs kept an epic tradition of oral history. The nation, which amalgamated nomadic tribes of various Kazakh origins, managed to preserve the distant memory of the original founding clans. It was important for a Kazakh to know his or her genealogical tree for no less than seven generations back (known as ', from the Arabic word ' – \"tree\").\n\nIn modern Kazakhstan, tribalism is fading away in business and government life. Still it is common for a Kazakh man or woman to ask another one which tribe he or she belongs to when getting acquainted with each other. Nowadays, it is more of a tradition than necessity. There is no hostility between tribes. Kazakhs, regardless of their tribal origin, consider themselves one nation.\n\nThose modern-day Kazakhs who yet remember their tribes know that their tribes belong to one of the three Zhuz (juz, roughly translatable as \"horde\" or \"hundred\"):\n\nThere is much debate surrounding the origins of the Hordes. Their age is unknown so far in extant historical texts, with the earliest mentions in the 17th century. The Turkologist Velyaminov-Zernov believed that it was the capture of the important cities of Tashkent, Yasi, and Sayram in 1598 by Tevvekel (Tauekel/Tavakkul) Khan that separated the Qazaqs, as only a portion of the Century possessed the cities. This theory suggests that the Qazaqs then divided among a wider territory after expanding from Zhetysu into most of the Dasht-i Qipchaq, with a focus on the trade available through the cities of the middle Syr Darya, of which Sayram and Yasi belonged.\n\nThe Kazakh language is a member of the Turkic language family, as are Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tatar, Uyghur, Turkish, Azeri, Turkmen, and many other living and historical languages spoken in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Xinjiang, and Siberia.\n\nKazakh belongs to the Kipchak (Northwestern) group of the Turkic language family. Kazakh is characterized, in distinction to other Turkic languages, by the presence of in place of reconstructed proto-Turkic and in place of ; furthermore, Kazakh has where other Turkic languages have .\n\nKazakh, like most of the Turkic language family lacks phonemic vowel length, and as such there is no distinction between long and short vowels.\n\nKazakh was written with the Arabic script during the 19th century, when a number of poets, educated in Islamic schools, incited revolt against Russia. Russia's response was to set up secular schools and devise a way of writing Kazakh with the Cyrillic alphabet, which was not widely accepted. By 1917, the Arabic script was reintroduced, even in schools and local government.\n\nIn 1927, a Kazakh nationalist movement sprang up but was soon suppressed. At the same time the Arabic script was banned and the Latin alphabet was imposed for writing Kazakh. The native Latin alphabet was in turn replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet in 1940 by soviet interventionists. Today, there are efforts to return to the Latin script.\n\nKazakh is a state (official) language in Kazakhstan. It is also spoken in the Ili region of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China, where the Arabic script is used, and in western parts of Mongolia (Bayan-Ölgii and Khovd province), where Cyrillic script is in use. European Kazakhs use the Latin alphabet.\n\nAncestors of modern Kazakhs believed in Shamanism and Tengrism, then Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Christianity including Church of the East. Islam was first introduced to ancestors of modern Kazakhs during the 8th century when the Arab missionaries entered Central Asia. Islam initially took hold in the southern portions of Turkestan and thereafter gradually spread northward. Islam also took root due to the zealous missionary work of Samanid rulers, notably in areas surrounding Taraz where a significant number of Turks accepted Islam. Additionally, in the late 14th century, the Golden Horde propagated Islam amongst the Kazakhs and other tribes. During the 18th century, Russian influence toward the region rapidly increased throughout Central Asia. Led by Catherine, the Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing Islam to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the region to preach to the Kazakhs whom the Russians viewed as \"savages\" and \"ignorant\" of morals and ethics. However, Russian policy gradually changed toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of collective consciousness. Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly elite Russian military institutions. In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring religious fervor by espousing pan-Turkism, though many were persecuted as a result. During the Soviet era, Muslim institutions survived only in areas where Kazakhs significantly outnumbered non-Muslims due to everyday Muslim practices. In an attempt to conform Kazakhs into Communist ideologies, gender relations and other aspects of the Kazakh culture were key targets of social change.\n\nIn more recent times however, Kazakhs have gradually employed a determined effort in revitalizing Islamic religious institutions after the fall of the Soviet Union. Some Kazakhs continue to identify with their Islamic faith, and even more devotedly in the countryside. Those who claim descent from the original Muslim soldiers and missionaries of the 8th century command substantial respect in their communities. Kazakh political figures have also stressed the need to sponsor Islamic awareness. For example, the Kazakh Foreign Affairs Minister, Marat Tazhin, recently emphasized that Kazakhstan attaches importance to the use of \"positive potential Islam, learning of its history, culture and heritage.\"\n\nPre-Islamic beliefs—the worship of the sky, of the ancestors, and of fire, for example—continued to a great extent to be preserved among the common people, however. The Kazakhs believed in the supernatural forces of good and evil spirits, of wood goblins and giants. To protect themselves from them, as well as from the evil eye, the Kazakhs wore protection beads and talismans. Shamanic beliefs are still widely preserved among the Kazakhs, as well as belief in the strength of the bearers of this worship—the shamans, which the Kazakhs call bakhsy. In contradistinction to the Siberian shamans, who used drums during their rituals, the Kazakh shamans, who could also be men or women, played (with a bow) on a stringed instrument similar to a large violin. At present both Islamic and pre-Islamic beliefs continue to be found among the Kazakhs, especially among the elderly. According to 2009 national census 39,172 Kazakhs are Christians.\n\nAccording to mitochondrial DNA studies (where sample consisted of only 246 individuals), the main maternal lineages of Kazakhs are: D (17.9%), C (16%), G (16%), A (3.25%), F (2.44%) of Eastern Eurasian origin (58%), and haplogroups H (14.1), T (5.5), J (3.6%), K (2.6%), U5 (3%), and others (12.2%) of western Eurasian origin (41%). An analysis of ancient Kazakhs found that East Asian haplogroups such as A and C did not begin to move into the Kazakh steppe region until around the time of the Xiongnu (1st millennia BCE), which is around the onset of the Sargat Culture as well .\n\nIn a sample of 54 Kazakhs and 119 Altaian Kazakh, the main paternal lineages of Kazakhs are: C (66.7% and 59.5%), O (9% and 26%), N (2% and 0%), J (4% and 0%), R (9% and 1%).\n\nIn a sample of 409 ethnic Kazakhs the main paternal lineages of Kazakhs are C, R, G, J, N, O, Q.\n\nAccording to a large-scale Kazakhstani study published in 2017, Kazakh males belong to Y-DNA haplogroups C2-M217 (658/1294 = 50.85%, including 322/1294 = 24.88% C-M401, 225/1294 = 17.39% C-M86, 80/1294 = 6.18% C-M407, and 31/1294 = 2.40% C-M217(xM401, M48, M407)), R-M207 (157/1294 = 12.13%, including 78/1294 = 6.03% R1a-M198, 41/1294 = 3.17% R1b-M478, 21/1294 = 1.62% R1b-M269, 13/1294 = 1.00% R2-M124 (predicted), and 4/1294 = 0.31% R-M207(xM198, M478, M269, M124)), O-M175 (140/1294 = 10.82%, including 122/1294 = 9.43% O-M134, 9/1294 = 0.70% O-M122(xM134), and 9/1294 = 0.70% O-M175(xM122)), J-M304 (106/1294 = 8.19%, including 53/1294 = 4.10% J2a-M410 (predicted), 50/1294 = 3.86% J1-M267 (predicted), and 3/1294 = 0.23% J-M304(xJ1, J2a)), N-M231 (69/1294 = 5.33%, including 49/1294 = 3.79% N-M46, 16/1294 = 1.24% N-P43, and 4/1294 = 0.31% N-M231(xP43, M46)), G-M201 (64/1294 = 4.95%, including 44/1294 = 3.40% G1-M285, 18/1294 = 1.39% G2-P287, and 2/1294 = 0.15% G-M201(xM285, P287)), Q-M242 (41/1294 = 3.17%), E-M35 (23/1294 = 1.78%), I-M170 (20/1294 = 1.55%, including 11/1294 = 0.85% I2a-L460 (predicted), 5/1294 = 0.39% I1-M253 (predicted), and 4/1294 = 0.31% I2b-L415 (predicted)), D-M174 (6/1294 = 0.46%), L-M20 (4/1294 = 0.31% (predicted)), H (3/1294 = 0.23% (predicted)), T (2/1294 = 0.15% (predicted)), and K* (1/1294 = 0.08%). However, the distribution was inhomogeneous for some Y-DNA haplogroups: Q-M242 was found predominantly among members of the Qangly tribe (27/40 = 67.50%), C-M407 was found predominantly among members of the Qongyrat tribe (64/95 = 67.37%), O-M134 was found predominantly among members of the Naiman tribe (102/155 = 65.81%), N-M46 was found predominantly among members of the Syrgeli tribe (21/32 = 65.63%), J1-M267 (predicted) was found predominantly among members of the Ysty tribe (36/57 = 63.16%), G1-M285 was found predominantly among members of the Argyn tribe (26/50 = 52.00%), R1b-M478 was found predominantly among members of the Qypshaq tribe (12/29 = 41.38%), and R1a-M198 was found with notable frequency among members of the Suan (13/41 = 31.71%) and Oshaqty (8/29 = 27.59%) tribes and among members of the Qoja caste of Islamic scholars and gentlemen (6/30 = 20.00%), although C-M401 was more common than R1a-M198 among members of the Suan and Oshaqty tribes (25/41 = 60.98% and 11/29 = 37.93%, respectively). Because of this lack of homogeneity among Kazakhs in regard to Y-chromosome DNA, the real percentage of present-day Kazakhs who belong to each Y-DNA haplogroup may differ from the percentages found in this study depending on the proportion of each tribe in the total population of Kazakhs.\n\nHistorical population of Kazakhs:\n\nIn Russia, the Kazakh population lives primarily in the regions bordering Kazakhstan. According to latest census (2002) there are 654,000 Kazakhs in Russia, most of whom are in the Astrakhan, Volgograd, Saratov, Samara, Orenburg, Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, Tyumen, Omsk, Novosibirsk, Altai Krai and Altai Republic regions. Though ethnically Kazakh, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, these people acquired Russian citizenship.\n\nKazakhs migrated into Dzungaria in the 18th century after the Dzungar genocide resulted in the native Buddhist Dzungar Oirat population being massacred.\n\nKazakhs, called Hāsàkè Zú in Chinese (哈萨克族; literally \"Kazakh people\" or \"Kazakh tribe\") are among 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. Thousands of Kazakhs fled to China during the 1932–1933 famine in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 30,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, Hui led by General Ma Bufang massacred their fellow Muslim Kazakhs, until there were 135 of them left.\n\nFrom Northern Xinjiang over 7,000 Kazakhs fled to the Tibetan-Qinghai plateau region via Gansu and were wreaking massive havoc so Ma Bufang solved the problem by relegating the Kazakhs into designated pastureland in Qinghai, but Hui, Tibetans, and Kazakhs in the region continued to clash against each other.\n\nTibetans attacked and fought against the Kazakhs as they entered Tibet via Gansu and Qinghai.\n\nIn northern Tibet Kazakhs clashed with Tibetan soldiers and then the Kazakhs were sent to Ladakh.\n\nTibetan troops robbed and killed Kazakhs 400 miles east of Lhasa at Chamdo when the Kazakhs were entering Tibet.\n\nIn 1934, 1935, and from 1936–1938 Qumil Eliqsan led approximately 18,000 Kerey Kazakhs to migrate to Gansu, entering Gansu and Qinghai.\n\nIn China there is one Kazakh autonomous prefecture, the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and three Kazakh autonomous counties: Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County in Gansu, Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County and Mori Kazakh Autonomous County in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Many Kazakhs in China are not fluent in Standard Chinese, instead speaking the Kazakh language. \"In that place wholly faraway\", based on a Kazakh folk song, is very popular outside the Kazakh regions, especially in the Far Eastern countries of China, Japan and Korea.\n\nIn the 19th century, the advance of the Russian Empire troops pushed Kazakhs to neighboring countries. In around 1860, part of the Middle Jüz Kazakhs came to Mongolia and were allowed to settle down in Bayan-Ölgii, Western Mongolia and for most of the 20th century they remained an isolated, tightly knit community.\nEthnic Kazakhs (so-called Altaic Kazakhs or Altai-Kazakhs) live predominantly in Western Mongolia in Bayan-Ölgii Province (88.7% of the total population) and Khovd Province (11.5% of the total population, living primarily in Khovd city, Khovd sum and Buyant sum). In addition, a number of Kazakh communities can be found in various cities and towns spread throughout the country. Some of the major population centers with a significant Kazakh presence include Ulaanbaatar (90% in khoroo #4 of Nalaikh düüreg, Töv and Selenge provinces, Erdenet, Darkhan, Bulgan, Sharyngol (17.1% of population total) and Berkh cities.\n400,000 Kazakhs live in Karakalpakstan and 100,000 in Tashkent province. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the vast majority of Kazakhs are returning to Kazakhstan, mainly to Manghistau Oblast. Most Kazakhs in Karakalpakstan are descendants of one of the branches of \"Junior juz\" (\"Kişi juz\") - Adai tribe.\n\nIran bought Kazakh slaves who were falsely masqueraded as Kalmyks by slave dealers from the Khiva and Turkmens.\n\nIranian Kazakhs live mainly in Golestan Province in northern Iran. According to ethnologue.org, in 1982 there were 3000 Kazakhs living in the city of Gorgan. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the number of Kazakhs in Iran decreased due to emigration to their historical motherland.\n\nAfghan Kypchaks are Aimak (Taimeni) tribe of Kazakh origin that can be found in Obi district to the east of the western Afghan province of Herat, between the rivers Farāh Rud and Hari Rud. Afghan Kypchaks, together with the Durzais and Kakar, two other tribes of Pushtun origin, constitute the Taymani tribe. There are approximately 440,000 Afghan Kipchaks.\n\nTurkey received refugees from among the Pakistan-based Kazakhs, Turkmen, Kirghiz, and Uzbeks numbering 3,800 originally from Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. Kayseri, Van, Amasya, Çiçekdağ, Gaziantep, Tokat, Urfa, and Serinyol received via Adana the Pakistan-based Kazakh, Turkmen, Kirghiz, and Uzbek refugees numbering 3,800 with UNHCR assistance.\n\nIn 1954 and 1969 Kazakhs migrated into Anatolia's Salihli, Develi and Altay regions. Turkey became home to refugee Kazakhs.\n\nThe Kazakh Turks Foundation (Kazak Türkleri Vakfı) is an organization of Kazakhs in Turkey.\n\nMany are skilled in the performance of Kazakh traditional songs. One of the most commonly used traditional musical instruments of the Kazakhs is the \"dombra\", a plucked lute with two strings. It is often used to accompany solo or group singing. Another popular instrument is \"kobyz\", a bow instrument played on the knees. Along with other instruments, these two instruments play a key role in the traditional Kazakh orchestra. A notable composer is Kurmangazy, who lived in the 19th century. After studying in Moscow, Gaziza Zhubanova became the first woman classical composer in Kazakhstan, whose compositions reflect Kazakh history and folklore. A notable singer of the Soviet epoch is Roza Rymbaeva, she was a star of the trans-Soviet-Union scale. A notable Kazakh rock band is Urker, performing in the genre of ethno-rock, which synthesises rock music with the traditional Kazakh music.\n\n\n"}

During their detention in the Ventas prison they were repeatedly tortured and humiliated, and conditions in the prison were considered inhumane and overcrowded. They were ultimately executed by firing squad against the wall of the East Cemetery (now la Almudena) on 5 August 1939. Many of their comrades at the prison recall that while they were being driven away by lorry to their deaths, they sang the \"Youthful Guardsmen\" (JSU's anthem) so as to be heard by their comrades who remained in jail.

Between the time of the 2008 strike in Mahalla al-Kubra and the onset of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, Mohemmad Adel enrolled in a training program directed by the Center for Non-Violent Action and Strategies, an entity founded by the Serbian pro-democracy youth movement Otpor!.\n\nMohammed Adel was tried by a Cairo misdemeanor court on charges of violating a controversial protest law and for allegedly assaulting police officers. On December 22, the court declared him to be guilty of violating the protest law, sentencing him and two other defendants, Ahmed Maher and Ahmed Douma, to three years of hard labor in prison, a requirement to pay a fine of LE50,000, and subjection to a three-year period of surveillance upon release from jail. Various Egyptian and international human rights organizations have condemned the trial as a symptom of a growing crackdown on pro-democracy and civil society activism; during the course of the trial, Amnesty International stated that the charges against Adel and other defendants \"may arise solely from their opposition activism\". Emad Hamdi, a member of the Egyptian Popular Current, condemned the verdict against Mohammed Adel, unfavorably juxtaposing the acquittals and light sentences given to Mubarak-era criminals with those being issued against revolutionary and democratic activists.\n\nIn the initial stages of the trial, Mohammed Adel was being tried in absentia. However, shortly before the verdict was announced, he was forcibly seized by police during the course of a raid on the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights. Police smashed some computers while confiscating other computers, electronic equipment, and documents. They also assaulted and detained a number of individuals present at the scene.\n\nHamdeen Sabahi has censured the court conviction sentencing Ahmed Maher, Mohamed Adel, and Ahmed Douma to three years in prison and a fine of LE50,000 and maintains that Interim President Adly Mansour should issue these and other detained individuals a pardon. The Constitution Party has expressed solidarity with the detainees and their families and requested that the interim President Adly Mansour issue a pardon to Ahmed Maher, Mohammed Adel, and Ahmed Douma, as well as to Loay Abdel Rahman, Omar Hussein, Islam Ahmed, and Nasser Ibrahim.\n\nAdel is strongly against the currently president Sisi. He describes his government as it injustice and bloody. Adel always calls for freedom for all detainees and prisoners activists.\n\nAdel now struggles against the decision of selling the two islands \"Tiran and Sanafir\" to the Saudi kingdom.\n\n\n"}

No other certain details are known about his life; Harnack's suggestion that he was identical with the Ptolemy spoken of by St. Justin is as yet unproved. It is not known when Ptolemy became a disciple of Valentinius, but Valentinius was active in the Egyptian city of Alexandria and in Rome. Ptolemy was, with Heracleon, the principal writer of the Italian or Western school of Valentinian Gnosticism, which was active in Rome, Italy, and Southern Gaul.\nPtolemy's works have reached us in an incomplete form as follows: \n\nThe latter is found in the works of Epiphanius. It was written in response to Flora's inquiry concerning the origin of the Law of the Old Testament. The Decalogue, Ptolemy states, cannot be attributed to the Supreme God, nor to the devil; indeed, the set of laws does not even proceed from a single law-giver. A part of it is the work of an inferior god, analogous to the gnostic demiurge; the second part is attributable to Moses, and the third part to the elders of the Jewish people. In addition, Ptolemy subdivides the part of the Decalogue ascribed to the inferior god into three further sections: \n\n\nThis part of the Decalogue includes such precepts as circumcision and fasting and was raised by the saviour from a sensible to a spiritual plane. The god who is the author of the law, insofar as it is not the product of human effort, is the demiurge who occupies a middle position between the Supreme God and the devil. He is the creator of the material universe, is neither perfect nor the author of evil, but ought to be called 'just' and benevolent to the extent of his abilities. \n\nIn his cosmogonic depiction of the universe, Ptolemy referred to an extensive system of aeons that emanated from a monadic spiritual source. Thirty of these, he believed, ruled the higher world, the \"pleroma\". This system became the basis of an exegesis which expounds the first Ogdoad of the Pleroma based on the prologue of John's gospel.\n\n\n"}

He participated in the Alsos Mission, which conducted a series of operations with the intent to place all uranium in Europe into Allied hands, and at the end of the war rounded up German atomic scientists to keep them out of the Soviet Union. He personally escorted half of the uranium-235 necessary for the Little Boy atomic bomb to the Pacific island of Tinian. He was also a key figure overseeing the construction of The Pentagon building. After the war he founded Furman Builders Inc., a construction company that built hundreds of structures, including the Potomac Mills shopping mall in Woodbridge, Virginia.\n\nRobert Ralph Furman was born on August 21, 1915, in Trenton, New Jersey, one of five sons of William and Leila Ficht Furman. His father was a bank teller, and his mother worked as a riveter during World War II. He attended Princeton University and graduated in 1937 with a degree in civil engineering. He then worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad and a construction company in New York.\n\nIn December 1940, Furman was activated as a member of the United States Army Reserve and assigned to the Quartermaster Corps Construction Division, where he worked for Colonel Leslie R. Groves, Jr., supervising the day-to-day construction of The Pentagon. When the building was completed in 1943, Groves was reassigned to the \"Manhattan Project\" and brought his aide, Furman, with him.\n\nIn August 1943 Furman was put in charge of an intelligence effort formed by Groves in response to concerns raised by atomic bomb project scientists about the German nuclear energy project. As director of intelligence, Furman was responsible for ascertaining the progress the Germans were making. In December 1943, Groves sent Furman to Britain to discuss the establishment of a London Liaison Office for the Manhattan Project and the British government, and to confer over coordinating the intelligence effort.\n\nFurman sent the spy Moe Berg to Switzerland to meet the head of the German project, Werner Heisenberg. After chatting with Heisenberg at a cocktail party, Berg concluded that the Germans were a long way behind the Allied effort. Furman travelled to Rome in June 1944, where he interviewed Italian scientists about the German project.\n\nWhen the Alsos Mission found documentation in office of Union Minière in Antwerp that indicated over 1,000 tons of refined uranium had been sent to Germany, but about 150 tons still remained at Olen, Belgium, Groves sent Furman back to Europe with orders to secure the Olen cache. The Alsos Mission located 68 tons there, but another 80 tons was missing, having been shipped to France in 1940 ahead of the German invasion of Belgium. Groves had the Olen uranium shipped to England and, ultimately, to the United States.\n\nDocumentation indicated that the missing uranium had been sent to Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Boris Pash's command reached Toulouse on October 1 and inspected a French Army arsenal with a Geiger counter. When the needle jumped near some barrels, they were inspected and found to be the 31 tons of uranium from Belgium. The 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company was released from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. The barrels were collected and transported to Marseilles, where Furman supervised their loading on a ship bound for the United States.\n\nIn April 1945, Furman participated in Operation Harborage. The Alsos Mission and the 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion occupied Haigerloch, where they found and destroyed a German experimental nuclear reactor, and recovered uranium and heavy water. The Alsos Mission took Heisenberg into custody on May 2. Furman supervised his detention and that of nine other German scientists, who were taken to Rheims, then Versailles, and finally to the country estate of Farm Hall in England, where their conversations were monitored and where they could not defect to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn July 1945, Furman personally escorted half of the uranium-235 necessary for the Little Boy atomic bomb to the Pacific island of Tinian. Accompanied by Captain James F. Nolan, a radiologist with Project Alberta, Furman set out by car from Santa Fe to Albuquerque on July 14, then travelled by air to Hamilton Field, California. The men boarded the cruiser at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, and crossed the Pacific to Tinian, arriving on July 26. A few days after leaving Tinian, the \"Indianapolis\" was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine with the loss of over 800 men.\n\nFurman left the army the year after the war ended and founded Furman Builders Inc. in Rockville, Maryland. The firm built hundreds of homes, schools and commercial buildings, including the Potomac Mills shopping mall in Woodbridge, Virginia, the Metropolitan Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., and the United States embassy in Nicaragua. He married Mary Eddy in 1952. They had four children: a son, David, and three daughters, Martha Keating, Julia Costello and Serena Furman.\n\nFor the most part, Furman kept quiet about his exploits during the war. He served as president of the local rotary club and sang baritone in a barbershop quartet. He retired in 1993, and died of metastatic melanoma on October 14, 2008 at Buckingham's Choice retirement community in Adamstown, Maryland at the age of 93.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "834604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=834604", "title": "Sam Hui", "text": "Sam Hui\n\nSamuel Hui Koon-kit (born 6 September 1948), usually known as Sam Hui, is a Hong Kong musician, singer, songwriter and actor. He is credited with popularising Cantopop both via the infusion of Western-style music and his usage of vernacular Cantonese rather than written vernacular Chinese in biting lyrics that addressed contemporary problems and concerns. Hui is considered by some to be the first major superstar of Cantopop, known as the God of Song.\n\nHui graduated from the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Hong Kong, Ying Wa College and St. Francis Xavier's College in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Hui and his two older brothers, Michael and Ricky, worked on several comedies in the early 1970s. Hui has also gained credit for popularising Cantopop, by incorporating the idiosyncrasies of Western popular music into the old Cantopop genre.\n\nHui started his career as a host on a youth music TV show on the TVB network. Sam and Michael Hui starred as the hosts in \"Hui Brothers Show\" (雙星報喜). At that time, he was the lead musician of a band The Lotus. In the early years of his career, Hui performed English songs that were popular in Britain and the United States. He wrote the theme songs for the comedies produced by his brother, Michael Hui, and started performing Cantonese songs.\n\nHui's music gained popular appeal, particularly with the working class, for its simplicity and the relevance of the lyrics. A prolific songwriter, a noted recurring theme in his music is that it often describes or humorously satirises Hong Kong society and events. One of his most popular songs during the mid-1970s was the theme song of the film \"The Private Eyes\", which humorously reflected on the harsh realities of middle and lower-income Hong Kongers. Others such as \"Song of Water Use\" (制水歌), which referenced the days of water rationing during the 1960s, and \"Could Not Care Less About 1997\" (話知你97), which encouraged Hong Kong people to adopt a \"carpe diem\" attitude instead of worrying about the imminent handover to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997, were more topical in nature and referenced local events. While some of his songs are lighthearted, others carried philosophical messages brought out through artful use of Chinese words that have multiple symbolism. Examples can be seen in his farewell song in 1992 and \"From the Heart of a Loafer\" (), where for Cantopop, the sophisticated language and messages were rare in the lyrics of contemporary artists.\n\nOn a personal note, Hui is closer to his middle brother Ricky than to their oldest brother Michael. Sam and Michael reportedly fell out with each other after their pre-1985 successes. However, in Michael's \"Chicken and Duck Talk\" (1988), Hui appeared in a short 1-minute cameo, playing the role of himself as master of ceremonies at the grand opening of Danny's Chicken, and contributed to its theme song for its end credits entitled \"You Have Your Say\" (你有你講). Then in 1990, the three brothers reunited in \"Front Page\", a lampoon on Hong Kong's sometimes over-zealous entertainment news industry. Hui also collaborated with several popular singers such as Leslie Cheung both musically and on-screen culminating in the hit single written by Hui and composed by Cheung entitled \"Silence is Golden\" (), which Cheung also sung as a solo track on his 1987 album, \"Hot Summer\", as well as the catchy tune, \"I've Never Been Afraid\" (我未驚過) in 1989 as the end theme for \"\".\n\nHui also starred in the \"Aces Go Places\", a series of Hong Kong action–comedies in the 1980s, with Karl Maka. Hui held a farewell concert in 1991 and 1992, in which he invited many music celebrities and officially declared that he would not be active in the movie industry nor in Cantopop in the future. He was once seriously injured while filming \"The Legend of Wisely\" in Tibet due to lack of oxygen, thereafter falling very ill and many of his fans pointed out that this near fatal accident may have been pivotal on his decision to retire as they superstitiously believed that he was haunted by a spirit.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Hui's father advised him to retire to avoid the stresses he endured from hosting concerts. Hui's \"lack of oxygen\" suffered on a previous film, was actually carbon monoxide poisoning. His mother purportedly also had reservations about his performing, including that he might injure himself on stage. A Hong Kong concert in 1990 supposedly marked his early retirement, however Hui then agreed to host a 42-show concert series. Around the time of the 30th show, Hui's father died but despite his grief, he continued to host. During 1991–1992, Hui hosted a total of 14 shows in Hong Kong preempting his actual retirement. He also hosted shows in Canada, in Vancouver, at the Pacific Coliseum, and Toronto, Ontario, which he dedicated to his late father. Despite reiterating his plans for retirement, Hui came back for a short stint in the movie \"Winner Takes All\" co-starring Nicholas Tse and Ruby Lin. This he maintained, was a result of being unable to ignore his heart's desire.\n\nWidely acclaimed as the \"God of Song\" in Hong Kong (the first singer to be so acknowledged), he decided to come out of retirement in 2004 and held multiple comeback concerts in which he was welcomed by a Hong Kong public at sell-out shows. In these concerts, he paid tribute to his recent passed close colleagues, Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui in 2003 and claimed that their deaths had influenced his decision to return to performing, culminating in his 2004 comeback song \"'04 Bless You\" (04' 祝福你). Hui performed in a concert in Kuala Lumpur on 19 and 20 February 2005 with his brother, Ricky Hui, and sons but has not made active plans for any follow-ups. He also performed in Vancouver on 15 December 2005 and in Singapore on 29 March 2008. In 2007, Hui signed with EC Music and released his first album in 17 years, named \"Life is Good\" ().\n\nHui is married to Filipino-American Rebecca \"Rebu\" Fleming, with whom he has two sons, Ryan and Scott. Ryan is also a singer-songwriter and has released several albums, while Scott has pursued a career in film, directing a few videos for his brother.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Typically, attendees knit, though others crochet (they are called 'Happy Hookers'), and still others engage in cross-stitching, embroidery, and other needlecraft. Nowadays, the groups have been analyzed by scholars as expressions of resistance to major political, social and technological change in Western societies. However, political discussion is not unusual at these events, and at least some participants are proponents of progressive, liberal, and/or leftist social and political change. Furthermore, the term Stitch ‘n' Bitch is now used by women from across the globe to connect with others in the virtual space seeing as the term has re-emerged in a world where the public sphere is the cyberspace.\n\nWith over 1460 registered Stitch ‘n Bitch groups in 289 cities worldwide, the social knitting movement has demarked itself as a popular social gathering for avid knitters.\n\n\"Stitch 'n Bitch\" is a name used by knitting groups that meet on a weekly or monthly basis at locations throughout the world. This use of the term originates as early as the Second World War. In 1999, Debbie Stoller started a Stitch 'n Bitch group in NYC's East Village, which was open to anyone who wanted to come to knit along or learn to knit. In 2000, she wrote about her groups in \"BUST\" magazine, of which she is the editor-in-chief. Brenda Janish read the article and started the Chicago Stitch 'n Bitch group. That article inspired Vickie Howell to start the Los Angeles Stitch 'n Bitch group and later the Austin Stitch 'n Bitch group. Like Stoller's original group, today's Stitch 'n Bitch clubs are generally casual groups of knitters who meet in public spaces such as bars or cafes for socializing and sharing knitting advice. These groups are free or small fee required memberships and open to the public, and are listed in a directory of worldwide knitting groups that was started by Janish and today is maintained by Stoller: Official Home of Stitch 'n Bitch. As of 2010, the site lists over 700 such groups.\n\nA book series by Debbie Stoller, includes \"Stitch 'n Bitch\" : The Knitter's Handbook\", \"Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker,\" and other titles. From 2005 to 2008, Stitch 'n Bitch was the focus of a trademark dispute. In June 2005, the company Sew Fast Sew Easy filed a trademark application for \"Stitch & Bitch\" to designate a line of knitting and sewing supplies. As of 2007 this application was suspended. In fall 2005, due to letters claiming trademark infringement from Sew Fast/Sew Easy's lawyers, knitting groups that had accounts with CafePress were forced to remove all items featuring the phrase \"Stitch 'n Bitch\". Local groups that communicated with each other through Yahoo! Groups were similarly forced to remove \"Stitch 'n Bitch\" from the name and description of their group. Some groups were deleted, but most groups were able to change their name on Yahoo! to SNB. In 2008, Sew Fast Sew Easy and Debbie Stoller reached a settlement in which Debbie Stoller retained the use of the mark in knitting while Sew Fast Sew Easy retains the use for sewing. Since then all four of Stoller's trademarks have now been registered. The Sew Fast Sew Easy store closed in 2012.\n\nIn recent years, the Stitch ‘n Bitch movement has been considered as a means of reclaiming women’s domestic work in feminist circles. Not only have groups officially been formed through website use, but groups of women on university campuses have also followed the trends in order to resist the taboo representation of the traditional woman.\n\nDr. Beth Ann Pentney, writing in Thirdspace journal, credited Stoller's publications with the rise of feminist knitting. Stoller introduced this approach to feminism to merge political involvement with a women’s community-building activity set in a Do-It-Yourself culture. As a response to Stoller, much scrutiny on the effectiveness of the reclamation of domestic arts as a political feminist act has been done. Some say that the reason of the reintroduction of knitting in modern social gatherings is mainly due to the increase in the search for individualism and the anti-consumerism attitude of our generation. With this said, it is important to denote the implication of technologies in the emergence of a “fabriculture” based on the reclamation of domestic arts and crafts. With the internet accessibility of online information and tips and tricks for knitters and crocheters, the traditionally personal practice of knitting can now be shared easily among strangers, and is open to public discussion and new ideas. These webs of knitters worldwide find affinities via a very modern technology opposing the traditional DIY nature of knitting.\n\n\n"}

He was diagnosed with AIDS in 1995. He currently serves as the Program Manager of the 50-Plus Network at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.\n\nCrisostomo grew up Catholic in a religious family. He attended church frequently and was an altar boy as well as a member of the church choir. While the church provided a sense of community, it also promoted intolerance of homosexuality. Eventually, this prompted Crisostomo to leave the church and his home.\n\nCrisostomo met his partner Jesse Solomon in 1988 in New York City. Solomon was a physical therapist who worked with severely disabled children as well as a personal trainer and yoga teacher. They moved to San Francisco in 1990 and were one of the first 50 same-sex couples to register at the San Francisco City Hall. Solomon passed on October 6, 1991 of HIV/AIDS.\n\nCrisostomo began doing HIV AIDS work in 1985 when he was in New York City. One of his jobs was at a club where many patrons began falling sick. He volunteered to do hospital visits for the terminally ill HIV/AIDS patients. Crisostomo himself contracted HIV in 1987 and was diagnosed with AIDS in 1995.\n\nIn 1992, Crisostomo became an HIV AIDS educator in the Asian Pacific Islanders LGBTQ community through the GAPA Community HIV Project (GCHP) and the Asian AIDS Project, which later merged to become the API Wellness Center. Guam's World AIDS day in 1992 was also the day that Crisostomo became the first Chamorro to publicly come out as living with AIDS. He continued to travel back to Guam and the Pacific area to provide assistance on HIV AIDS capacity building and service provision.\n\nIn 2001, Crisostomo moved from San Francisco to Guam to become the Executive Director of the Coral Life Foundation, a community-based organization working on HIV AIDS in the Asia-Pacific Area. Coral Life Foundation was the first NGO in the area to work on HIV AIDS. In that capacity, Crisostomo convened representatives from the six Pacific Island Jurisdictions which included AIDS directors, program staff, community stakeholders, along with capacity-building assistance providers funded by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to discuss the state of HIV prevention and care services in their respective jurisdictions. From these discussions PIJAAG was formed to advocate for the provision of quality HIV prevention and care services and to advise national, international, and local policy entities on HIV AIDS issues within the region. Under Crisostomo's leadership, PIJAAG successful advocacy led to a $600,000 increase in the region’s HIV Prevention budget, funding of 3 Planning Grants for Care Services and baseline awards for services to those Living with HIV. The Coral Life Foundation closed in 2002 and was replaced with GuaHAN Project, otherwise known as the Guam HIV/AIDS Network.\n\nCrisostomo later became the Executive Director of 7 Sisters, a broad-based alliance of regional Asia Pacific HIV/AIDS networks based in Thailand. He also served as UN AIDS Asia Pacific NGO Delegate from 2009-2010.\n\nCrisostomo currently facilitates the 50-Plus Network through the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. This network serves the gay, bi, and trans men community members who are 50 years or older in San Francisco through meetings twice a month and social gatherings.\n\nCrisostomo co-authored two academic papers on HIV AIDS.\n"}
{"id": "2109434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2109434", "title": "William Remington", "text": "William Remington\n\nWilliam Walter Remington (October 25, 1917 – November 24, 1954) was an economist employed in various federal government positions until his career was interrupted by accusations of espionage made by the Soviet spy and defector Elizabeth Bentley. He was convicted of perjury in connection with these charges in 1953, and murdered in prison in 1954.\n\nHe was born in New York City and raised in Ridgewood, in Bergen County, New Jersey, by Lillian Maude Sutherland (1888-1969) and Frederick C. Remington (1870–1956). His father worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.; his mother was an art teacher in New York. Remington was admitted to Dartmouth College at age 16, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude in 1939, and earned a Master's degree from Columbia University in 1940. Coming from a branch of the wealthy Remington family of Illion, New York, Remington's parents were demanding and he developed a somewhat unconventional and flamboyant personality. From an early age, he was drawn to radical leftist politics, and declared to his friends that he was a Communist when he was 15. In college, he became active with members of the Young Communist League, and later the Communist Party of the United States. In testimony, Remington stated that while he was a Republican when he entered college, he \"moved left quite rapidly\" and became a radical but was never a Communist Party or Young Communist League member at Dartmouth. Whether or not he ever officially joined the party later became a point of contention in his legal battles.\n\nRemington was employed in a number of posts, principally as an economist:\n\nFor his position with the Office of Price Administration, Remington was required to undergo a loyalty-security check, which began in 1941. He admitted having been active in Communist-allied groups such as the American Peace Mobilization, but denied any sympathy with communism and swore under oath that he was not and had never been a member of the Communist Party. His leftist affiliations raised concerns, but the investigation was superficial and his security clearance was approved.\n\nIn March 1942 and continuing for two years, Remington had occasional meetings with Elizabeth Bentley at which he passed her information. This material included data on airplane production and other matters concerning the aircraft industry, as well as some information on an experimental process for manufacturing synthetic rubber. Remington later claimed that he was unaware that Bentley was connected with the Communist Party, that he believed she was a journalist and researcher, and that the information he gave her was not secret. Bentley was a Communist and an espionage agent for the Soviet Union, who in 1945 broke with the Communists and became an informer for the FBI. She then implicated a number of her contacts, including Remington. Bentley's revelations of Soviet espionage activities in the United States received a great deal of press attention. She identified more than 80 Americans—including several employees of government offices—as working for the Soviets, of whom only William Remington was still working in a government position.\n\nActing on Bentley's information, the FBI began secret surveillance of Remington in late 1945. Remington was by this time disillusioned with communism and had broken off his relationships with radical organizations, so the investigation revealed nothing of interest.\nIn 1946, Remington was working with the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. From there he transferred in March 1947 to a position with the President's Council of Economic Advisers, where he was paid an annual salary of $10,305. Because the FBI was keeping Bentley's testimony and its investigation of Remington secret, it raised no objection, with the result that Remington remained in fairly high-level government posts.\n\nIn 1947, Remington was interviewed by the FBI and also questioned before a federal grand jury in New York City about the information he had given to Elizabeth Bentley. He testified that no secret information was involved, and the issue seemed to end there. In an apparent attempt to bolster belief in his innocence, Remington became an anti-communist informer from this time and for the following year. He sent the FBI information on over fifty people, only four of whom were connected with his own case. Most of those he named he had never met. He accused them of being Communists, isolationists, Negro nationalists, or \"extreme liberals.\" He also verbally attacked his wife Ann, from whom he was now estranged, and his mother-in-law Elizabeth Moos, both avowed Communists.\n\nAnother loyalty investigation of Remington was opened early in 1948, and in June, he was relieved of his duties pending the findings of that investigation. In July of that year, the \"New York World-Telegram\" published a series of articles about Elizabeth Bentley, and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations opened hearings to investigate her charges. At these hearings, Bentley made her accusations against Remington public and Remington in turn denied them. The \"Washington Post\" called him \"a boob...who was duped by clever Communist agents.\" At his loyalty review hearings, Remington downplayed his earlier connections with Communist and leftist organizations and claimed that his wife's adherence to Communist doctrine was the reason for the end of their marriage.\n\nWhile testifying before the Senate, Bentley was protected from libel suits. When she repeated her charge that Remington was a Communist on NBC Radio's \"Meet the Press\", he sued her and NBC for libel. At this point, Remington's case acquired considerable notoriety. When Remington's lawyers attempted to subpoena Bentley, she initially could not be found, prompting headlines of \"RED WITNESS \"MISSING\" AT 100-G SLANDER SUIT\" and the like. When she finally reappeared, she was subpoenaed for the libel suit. She refused to testify at Remington's loyalty hearing. The Loyalty Review Board noted that the only serious evidence against Remington was \"the uncorroborated statement of a woman who refuses to submit herself to cross-examination,\" and cleared Remington to return to his government post. The libel suit was settled out of court shortly thereafter, with NBC paying Remington $10,000.\n\nIn 1950, the FBI and the federal grand jury in New York City reopened their investigations of Remington and the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) opened a third. Because of continuing suspicions about him, Remington had been demoted at the Commerce Department, and his once-promising career in the Truman administration was stagnant. Ann Remington, now divorced from him, was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Initially reluctant, she testified that her husband had been a dues-paying member of the Communist Party, and that he had given secret information to Elizabeth Bentley while knowing that Bentley was a Communist. A few days later she recanted, and stated that she would claim marital privilege and refuse to testify against her ex-husband in any trial. The grand jury decided to indict Remington for committing perjury when he denied ever being a member of the Communist Party.\n\nRemington's first trial began in late December 1950. Roy Cohn, later to become famous as Joseph McCarthy's chief counsel and already a noted anti-communist, joined the prosecution's legal team. \"Elizabeth Bentley later supplied a wealth of detail about Remington's involvement with her and the espionage conspiracy. Remington's defense was that he had never handled any classified material, hence could not have given any to Miss Bentley. But she remembered all the facts about the rubber-from-garbage invention. We had searched through the archives and discovered the files on the process. We also found the aircraft schedules, which were set up exactly as she said, and inter office memos and tables of personnel which proved Remington had access to both these items. We also discovered Remington's application for a naval commission in which he specifically pointed out that he was, in his present position with the Commerce Department, entrusted with secret military information involving airplanes, armaments, radar, and the Manhattan Project (the atomic bomb).\" \n\nDuring the trial eleven witnesses claimed they knew Remington was a communist. This included Elizabeth Bentley, Ann Remington, Professor Howard Bridgeman of Tufts University, Kenneth McConnell, a Communist organizer in Knoxville, Rudolph Bertram and Christine Benson, who worked with him at the Tennessee Valley Authority and Paul Crouch, who provided him with copies of the southern edition of the communist newspaper, the Daily Worker.\n\nAnn Remington reversed herself again and testified that her ex-husband had been a Communist Party member and that he had knowingly given secret information to Elizabeth Bentley. Bentley testified, repeating her charge that Remington had given her secret information, saying with regard to the synthetic rubber formula, \"He said to me that...he thought that the Russians would need something very much like this.\" The prosecution also showed that Remington had handled secret documents that were somewhat similar to the aircraft production information that Bentley said she received from Remington.\n\nDuring the trial, the defense attorneys revealed that John Brunini, the foreman of the grand jury that indicted Remington, had a personal and financial relationship with Elizabeth Bentley and had agreed to co-author a book with her.\n\nRemington was convicted after a seven-week trial. Judge Gregory E. Noonan handed down a sentence of five years - the maximum for perjury - noting that Remington's act of perjury had involved disloyalty to his country. Remington's conviction was celebrated by many. A \"Washington Daily News\" editorial said: \"William W. Remington now joins the odiferous list of young Communist punks who wormed their way upward in the Government under the New Deal. He was sentenced to five years in prison, and he should serve every minute of it. In Russia, he would have been shot without trial.\"\n\nRemington's attorneys appealed the verdict, and the judicial panel hearing the case included Judge Learned Hand, one of America's most eminent jurists. The conviction was overturned on the grounds that Judge Noonan's instructions to the jury were too vague as to exactly what constituted \"membership\" in the Communist Party, and a new trial was ordered. Hand also criticized grand jury foreman John Brunini and Thomas Donegan, the assistant to the Attorney General who directed the grand jury investigation, for Brunini's relationship with Bentley and for \"judicial improprieties\" in their abusive treatment of both Ann and William Remington during questioning.\n\nInstead of retrying Remington under the existing indictment, the government presented a new one charging Remington with five counts of perjury based on his testimony during the first trial. The charge from the first trial, that he perjured himself when denying he had ever been a Communist Party member, was not included.\n\nThe second Remington trial began in January 1953 with Judge Vincent L. Leibell presiding. It lasted only eight days. The jury found Remington guilty of two counts, for lying when he said he had not given secret information to Elizabeth Bentley and that he did not know of the existence of the Young Communist League, which had a chapter at Dartmouth while Remington was a student there. Leibell sentenced Remington to three years in prison. While his attorneys prepared another appeal, Remington began his sentence at Danbury Federal Correctional Institution where he became friends with fellow prisoner, nonviolent action theorist Gene Sharp, before being transferred to Lewisburg. The appeals court upheld the original verdict, and in February 1954, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.\n\nOne of Remington's fellow inmates at Lewisburg was George McCoy, a violent man with an I.Q. of 61. McCoy was known to have made a number of angry remarks about Remington's communism. On the morning of November 22, 1954, McCoy convinced another inmate, 17-year-old juvenile delinquent Lewis Cagle, Jr., to join him in attacking Remington as he slept. Cagle used a piece of brick in a sock as a weapon, striking Remington four times on the head. Two days later, Remington died of his injuries. The prison warden described it to Remington's second wife as \"not a personal attack against Bill...but just the actions of a couple of hoodlums who got all worked up by...the publicity about Communists.\" The FBI stated that robbery was the motive for the crime. His funeral was held in Ridgewood, New Jersey on November 28, 1954.\n\nPress attention focused on whether more should have been done to protect him in prison, and whether his murder was motivated by anti-communism. When Cagle confessed, the FBI instructed him to describe the crime as if he and McCoy had been trying to rob Remington.\nWhen McCoy confessed four days later, he said he hated Remington for being a Communist and denied any robbery motive.\n\nWorried that Cagle and McCoy's confessions might be ruled inadmissible and afraid that a jury would be sympathetic towards men who murdered a Communist, U.S. attorney J. Julius Levy accepted pleas of second degree murder from McCoy and Cagle. They received life sentences.\n\nRemington's biographer Gary May concludes: \"Clearly, Remington was no political innocent duped by the Communists, and his conviction for perjury seems justified. Yet Remington was no pro-Soviet automaton, no slave to Party or ideology, and not even the FBI, at least privately, was willing to classify him as a Russian spy.\"\n\n\n"}
