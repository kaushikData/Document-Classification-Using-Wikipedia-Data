{"id": "2470797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2470797", "title": "Clarence Brandley", "text": "Clarence Brandley\n\nClarence Lee Brandley (September 24, 1951 – September 2, 2018) was an American man who was wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of Cheryl Dee Fergeson in 1981. Brandley was working as a janitor supervisor at Conroe High School in Conroe, Texas where Fergeson was a 16-year-old student athlete visiting the school from Bellville, Texas.\nBrandley was held for nine years on death row. After lengthy legal proceedings and community outcry that eventually ended in the Supreme Court of the United States, Clarence Brandley was freed in 1990. After his release, Brandley was involved in further legal proceedings over child support payments that had accrued over his time in prison, and ultimately with an unsuccessful $120 million lawsuit against various agencies of the State of Texas.\n\nCheryl Dee Fergeson, a 16-year-old junior at Bellville High School, was murdered on August 23, 1980. Fergeson was part of a school volleyball team playing a match against another high school in Conroe, Texas. Her body was found in the loft above the school auditorium.\n\nSuspicion immediately fell on two of the custodians, Brandley and Henry (Icky) Peace, who had found the body. During their joint interrogation — as Peace would recount — Texas Ranger Wesley Styles told them, \"One of you is going to have to hang for this\" and then, turning to Brandley, added, \"Since you're the nigger, you're elected.\"\n\nThe three claimed to have seen the victim enter a girls' restroom near the school gymnasium, and then to have seen Brandley walking toward the restroom with an armload of toilet paper. They claimed that they told Brandley there was a girl in the restroom, and that he replied that he was taking the toilet paper to the boys' restroom. They did not see him again until about 45 minutes later, after a search had begun for the missing student. The fourth white custodian, Peace, subsequently added that Brandley was insistent on immediately searching the loft and, when they found the body, calmly checked for a pulse and then notified the authorities. And all four said that only Brandley had keys to the auditorium where the body was found.\n\nBefore an all-white Montgomery County grand jury on August 28, 1980, five days after the crime, Brandley professed innocence. Although he contradicted his white co-workers in several respects, he acknowledged that he had disappeared for perhaps 30 minutes about the time the murder was believed to have occurred. He said he was in the custodian's office smoking and listening to music alone. He also testified that a number of other persons had master keys that would open the auditorium and, in any event, that doors near the stage usually were propped open with a two-by-four.\n\nBrandley went on trial in December 1980 before an all-white jury. There was no physical evidence linking him to the crime. Spermatozoa recovered from the victim's body had been destroyed — without having been tested to determine whether Brandley could have been its source. Moreover, a fresh blood spot had been found on the victim's blouse that had not come from her and could not have come from Brandley. The spot was Type A, but Brandley had Type O blood. One juror found the evidence insufficient to establish guilt, forcing Judge Sam Robertson, Jr. to declare a mistrial. The name of the holdout juror — William Shreck — became public knowledge, leading to anonymous harassing telephone calls. One man, whose anonymous communication was monitored by police, threatened Shreck, \"We're going to get you, nigger lover.\"\n\nAt Brandley's second trial in February 1981 before another all-white jury but a different judge, one of the original witnesses — John Sessum — was not called. Later it was discovered that the prosecution had decided not to use Sessum because he no longer was willing to support the other custodians' versions of events, even though he had been threatened with being charged with perjury if he refused to go along. However, the prosecution came up with a witness who had not testified previously. He was Danny Taylor, a junior at the school, who had worked briefly as a custodian but was fired before the crime. Taylor claimed that Brandley once had commented — after a group of white female students walked past them — \"If I got one of them alone, ain't no tellin' what I might do.\"\n\nDr. Joseph Jachimczyk, medical examiner for Harris County, testified that the victim had died of strangulation and that a belt belonging to Brandley was consistent with the ligature used in the crime. In closing argument, District attorney James Keeshan mentioned that Brandley had a second job at a funeral home and suggested that perhaps he was a necrophiliac and had raped Fergeson after she was dead — an argument that could not have been made in good faith because Keeshan had a report stating that Brandley only did odd jobs at the funeral home and had never been involved in the preparation of bodies for burial. The defense objected to Keeshan's remark as inflammatory, but Judge John Martin overruled the objection.\n\nEleven months after Brandley was convicted and sentenced to death, his appellate lawyers discovered that exculpatory evidence had disappeared while in the custody of the prosecution — including a Caucasian pubic hair and other hairs recovered from Fergeson's body that were neither hers nor Brandley's. Also missing were photographs taken of Brandley on the day of the crime showing that he was not wearing the belt that the prosecution claimed had been the murder weapon. The missing evidence was all the more troubling in light of the pretrial destruction of the spermatozoa.\n\nMuch was made of the willful destruction and disappearance of the potentially exculpatory evidence in Brandley's appellate briefs, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence without mentioning the issue. \"No reasonable hypothesis is presented by the evidence to even suggest that someone other than [Brandley] committed the crime\", said the court. Brandley V. Texas, 691 S.W.2d 699 (1985).\n\nBrenda Medina, who lived in the nearby town of Cut and Shoot, Texas, saw a television broadcast about the Brandley case. Saying she had been unaware of the case until then, she told a neighbor that her former live-in boyfriend — James Dexter Robinson — had told her in 1980 that he had committed such a crime. Robinson had previously worked as a janitor at Conroe High School. Medina said she had not believed Robinson at the time, but now it made sense. At the neighbor's suggestion, she went to see an attorney, who took her to see District Attorney Peter Speers III, who had succeeded Keeshan in the job when Keeshan ascended to the Texas District Court bench. Speers quickly concluded, or so he said, that Medina was unreliable — and, therefore, that he had no obligation to inform Brandley's lawyers. The private attorney she had consulted thought otherwise, however, and brought her to the attention of the defense.\n\nAfter obtaining Medina's sworn statement, Brandley's lawyers petitioned the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for a writ of \"habeas corpus\". The court ordered an evidentiary hearing, which was conducted by District Court Judge Ernest A. Coker.\n\nBefore calling Medina to testify at the evidentiary hearing, Brandley's defense team called Edward Payne, father-in-law of Gary Acreman, one of the school custodians who had testified at both Brandley trials and who was now suspected by the defense of having been a co-perpetrator of the crime with Robinson. Payne testified that Acreman had told him where Fergeson's clothes had been hidden two days before the authorities found them.\n\nAfter Medina related details of Robinson's purported confession, Brandley's lawyers called John Sessum, the custodian who had testified at the first trial but not the second. Sessum's testimony was in sharp contrast to what he had said at the first trial. He now said he had seen Acreman follow Cheryl Fergeson up a staircase leading to the auditorium and then heard her scream, \"No\" and \"Don't.\" Later that day, Acreman warned Sessum not to tell anyone what he had seen. But Sessum said he did tell someone — Wesley Styles, the Texas Ranger who was leading the investigation. That was a mistake. Styles, according to Sessum, responded by threatening him with arrest if he did not tell a story consistent with Acreman's.\n\nDespite the accumulation of new evidence, Judge Coker recommended that Brandley be denied a new trial — a recommendation perfunctorily accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeals on December 22, 1986. But by now civil rights activists, including Reverend Jew Don Boney, had coalesced and raised $80,000 to help finance further efforts on Brandley's behalf. The Rev. Boney was the Chairman of the Houston, Texas-based \"Coalition to Free Clarence Lee Brandley\" and spearheaded community efforts to have Brandley receive a fair trial. Boney was interviewed on numerous national news outlets and brought significant media and community attention to the case. National Advocate James McCloskey, of Centurion Ministries in Princeton, New Jersey, also took on the case.\n\nWorking with a private investigator, McCloskey soon obtained a video-taped statement from Acreman stating that Robinson had killed Cheryl Fergeson and that he had seen Robinson place her clothes in a dumpster where they were found; that is how Acreman knew where the clothes were before they were found. Although Acreman soon recanted that video statement, two witnesses had come forward attesting that they had heard Acreman say he knew who killed Fergeson, that it was not Brandley, but that he would never tell who did it. Based on these statements, with Brandley's execution only six days away, Coker granted a stay.\n\nAfter further investigation, Brandley's lawyers petitioned for another evidentiary hearing, which the Court of Criminal Appeals granted on June 30, 1987. The new hearing was conducted by Special State District Judge Perry Pickett. Robinson, Acerman, and Styles testified for the prosecution, each seeming to help rather than hurt Brandley's case.\n\nRobinson admitted he had told Brenda Medina in 1980 that he had killed the young woman in Conroe, but claimed he had said that only to frighten Medina. She had been pressuring him because she was pregnant, he said, and he simply wanted her to stop pestering him. Acreman stuck by what he had said at both trials, although he admitted that Robinson had been at Conroe High School the morning of the murder. Incidentally, Robinson and Acreman, unlike Brandley, had Type A blood — consistent with the spot on Fergeson's blouse.\n\nTexas Ranger Styles, while denying he had done anything improper, acknowledged that even before he had interviewed any witnesses, Brandley was his only suspect. When pressed about why he had not obtained a hair sample from Acreman to compare with the Caucasian pubic hair and other hairs found on the victim, Styles stammered, \"Let's say I didn't do it and it wasn't done, and why it wasn't done, I don't know.\"\n\nOn October 9, 1987, Judge Pickett recommended that the Court of Criminal Appeals grant Brandley a new trial, declaring: \"The litany of events graphically described by the witnesses, some of it chilling and shocking, leads me to the conclusion the pervasive shadow of darkness has obscured the light of fundamental decency and human rights.\" The Court of Criminal Appeals, after sitting on the case for 14 months, finally accepting Picket's recommendation with a sharply split en banc decision on December 13, 1989 (Ex Parte Brandley, 781 S.W.2d 886 (1989)).\n\nThe prosecution appealed, delaying disposition of the case another 10 months. But within hours of the U.S. Supreme Court's denial of certiorari on October 1, 1990 (Texas v. Brandley, 498 U.S. 817 (1990)), they dropped all charges. A few months later, Brandley was ordained as a Baptist minister, and a few months after that he was married. The officials involved in the case were not disciplined, nor did they apologize. Prosecutors in the case still insist they convicted the right man.\n\n"}
{"id": "5573019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5573019", "title": "Czech name", "text": "Czech name\n\nCzech names are composed of a given name and a surname. Czechs typically get one given name – additional names may be chosen by themselves upon baptism but they generally use one. With marriage, the bride typically adopts the bridegroom's surname.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, names are simply known as \"jména\" (\"names\") or, if the context requires it, \"křestní jména\" (\"Baptism names\"). The singular form is \"jméno\". Generally, a given name may have Christian roots or traditional Slavic pre-Christian origin (e.g. Milena, Dobromira, Jaroslav, Václav, Vojtěch).\n\nIn the past, it was common to give only officially recognized names to children, which were mostly adopted from extended Christian calendar. A special permission was necessary for other names; of course, there were exception for minorities, foreigners etc. Since the Velvet revolution in 1989, parents have had the right to give their child any name they wish, provided it is used somewhere in the world and is not insulting or demeaning. However, the common practice of last years is that most birth-record offices look for the name in the book \"Jak se bude vaše dítě jmenovat?\" (What is your child going to be called?), which is a semi-official list of \"allowed\" names. If the name is not found there, authorities are extremely unwilling to register the child's name.\n\nCzech parents remain somewhat conservative in their choices of baby names. In January 2004, the most popular boy's names were \"Jan\" (John), \"Jakub\" (Jacob or James) and \"Tomáš\" (Thomas). The most popular girl's names were \"Tereza\" (Theresa), \"Kateřina\" (Katherine) and \"Eliška\" (Liz or Elise). Throughout all the nine years, the name Tereza is ruling among girls born in January every year. There are much more girls of that name than those of the name on the second position. For six years, the second position belonged to little girls named Kateřina, who have lost recently to Eliška, later to Adéla and most recently to Karolína. Promotion of Eliška upwards to the most popular names was patient and slow, while Adéla kept near the top more steadily (during the last five years she kept the second to fourth position and only in 2007 she fell to the sixth). Quick jump in popularity belongs to Natálie, who remains for six years between the third and seventh position. Anna is celebrating her comeback to the fourth position (her fame was overshadowed only in 2002). Top positions were gradually cleaned out by Nikola (from the previous fourth position she left the first fifteen completely and later came back to around the tenth position). Kristýna holds tight among the top ten for eight years (the trend is, however, decreasing in the long term). Jumper of the last three years is probably Karolína (on the turn of the decades she kept right below the top ten, later her fame was waning, however, during recent years she jumped\ngradually to the sixth, seventh and even to the second position). Throughout the surveyed period, during the first four years popularity of Barbora was growing dynamically, but from 2003 she is on the tenth to fourteenth position. In the beginning of the period, Veronika was very popular; during five years she fell from the sixth position to the\ntwelfth and later came back to the top ten for a while in 2006. Lucie was in the bottom among the most popular names during the last nine years, however, recently she can be found in the end of the top ten list and her popularity seems to gradually increase.\n\nNames, like all nouns in the language, have grammatical cases; that is, they change depending on their role in the sentence. For example, one would say \"Pavel kouše sendvič\" (\"Paul bites a sandwich\"), but \"Pes kouše Pavla\" (\"A dog bites Paul\") and \"Pes ukousl Pavlovi prst\" (\"The dog bit Paul's finger off\"). Unlike the very closely related Slovak language, Czech has a vocative case, a form of a word used only when calling or addressing someone. For instance, one would say, \"Pavle, pozor pes!\" (Paul, watch out for the dog!).\n\nWhile Czechs share relatively few given names — roughly 260 names have a frequency above 500 in the Czech Republic — there are tens of thousands of Czech surnames (singular and plural: \"příjmení\"). These are similar in origin to English ones and may reflect:\n\nWhat is not shared with English but is similar to North American native languages is the extremely colorful nature of some Czech surnames, such as \"Brzobohatý\" (Soon to be rich), \"Volopich\" (Pricking an ox), \"Urvinitka\" (Tear a string), \"Rádsetoulal\" (Liked wandering around), \"Stojaspal\" (Slept standing), \"Vítámvás\" (I welcome you), \"Tenkrát\" (Back in those days), \"Schovajsa\" (Hide yourself!), \"Nebojsa\" (Don't be afraid!), \"Skočdopole\" (Jump in a field!), \"Vozihnoj\" (Driving with manure), \"Osolsobě\" (Salt for yourself!), \"Ventluka\" (Knocking outward), \"Nejezchleba\" (Don't eat bread!), \"Potměšil\" (He sewed in the dark), \"Přecechtěl\" (He wanted anyway), \"Drahokoupil\" (He bought costly), \"Nepovím\" (I'm not going to tell) or \"Blabla\".\n\nGerman surnames are also quite common in the Czech Republic; the country was part of the Austrian Empire before 1918 and had a large German population until World War II. Some of them got phonetically normalized and transcribed to Czech (\"Müller\" (miller) as well as \"Miler\"; \"Stein\" (Stone) as well as \"Štajn\", \"Schmied\" (Smith) as well as \"Šmíd\" (or \"Šmýd\"), Fritsch (Frič), Schlessinger (Šlesingr), etc. Some of them retain their original German surnames e. g. : Gottwald, Feiersinger, Dienstbier, Berger, Koller, Klaus, Franz, Forman, Ebermann, Lendl, Ulihrach, Gebauer, Kaberle, Vogelstanz, etc.\n\nMany of Czech surnames occur in a diminutive form, e. g. Sedlák – Sedláček, Polák → Poláček, Novák → Nováček, Zajíc → Zajíček, Němec → Němeček, Kalous → Kalousek, Havel → Havlík → Havlíček, Kovář → Kovařík → Kovaříček, Holub → Holoubek, Kocour → Kocourek, Cibula → Cibulka, Petržela → Petrželka, Chalupa → Chaloupka, Čáp → Čapek, Beran – Beránek\n\nThe most common Czech surnames are \"Novák\" (\"Newman\"), \"Svoboda\" (\"Freeman,\" literally \"Freedom\"), \"Novotný\" (same origin as \"Novák\"), \"Dvořák\" (from \"dvůr\", \"court\") and \"Černý\" (\"Black\").\n\nAs in English-speaking countries, Czech women traditionally receive their father's surname at birth and take their husband's name when they marry. However, the names are not exactly the same; the endings differ to fit into the Czech language's systems of gender adjectives. For example, the tennis players Cyril Suk and Helena Suková are brother and sister; \"Suková\" is the feminine form of \"Suk\". In fact, Czech female surnames are almost always feminine adjectives. There are several ways of forming them, depending on their male counterpart:\n\n\nA few Czech surnames do not differ for men and women in the nominative case (the case used for the subject of a sentence). Those include surnames whose male form is genitive plural, (e.g. \"Jirků\", \"Janků\") and those whose male form is an adjective with the suffix \"-í\" (e.g. \"Tachecí\", \"Jarní\"). Note that these are only identical in two of the seven grammatical cases; in the other five, the male and female forms differ, as per the soft adjective declension. The woman's surname is also not declined if it is of foreign origin and adding the suffix \"-ová\" would be awkward or unfeasible: Olga Walló, Blanka Matragi.\n\nOtherwise, \"-ová\" is still added, even when speaking of foreigners (\"Angela Merkelová\"). Because gender-marked suffixes are inherited in the Czech grammar and also because the gender of a person could be told straight from the surname regardless of the context, Czechs tend to add a feminine suffix to the surnames of Czech as well as foreign women surnames. Thus, e.g. American first lady Michelle Obama is referred to as \"Michelle Obamová\" in the Czech press. Science Fiction writer Ursula Le Guin appears in Czech translations as \"Ursula Le Guinová\". This phenomenon is not universal, however. In recent years, there has been lively discussion whether or not to change foreign female surnames in public use (such as in media references etc.). Supporters of abandoning this habit claim that adding a Czech female suffix to a foreign surname means deliberately changing a woman's name and is therefore both misleading and inconsiderate, whereas traditionalists point out that only by adding the suffix can the name be used as a flexible feminine adjective within a naturally sounding Czech sentence. Although the discussion continues, the majority of newspapers and other media use the \"adopted\" versions.\n\nUntil 2004, every woman who married in the Czech Republic and wanted to change her name had to adopt a feminine surname, unless her husband was a foreigner whose name ended in a vowel or she was a registered member of a Czech minority group, such as the Germans. A law passed in 2004 allows all foreign women, and Czech women who marry foreign men, to adopt their husband's exact surname.\n\nAs in English-speaking countries, some Czech women decide to keep their maiden name after marriage or adopt a double surname. A couple can also agree to both adopt the woman's surname, with the husband using the masculine form.\n\nSurnames that are nouns in the masculine singular:\n\nAll forms of the surname \"Novák\" are possessive adjectives in the plural; their endings depend on the gender and case.\n\nSurnames that are adjectives in the masculine singular:\n\nAll forms of the surname \"Novotný\" are adjectives in the plural; their endings depend on the gender and case. The form \"Novotných\" is in the genitive case.\n\n\n"}

Kohl is widely regarded as the \"father of the German reunification\" and as a principal architect of the Maastricht Treaty which established the European Union (EU) and the euro currency, and became the second person to be named an Honorary Citizen of Europe in 1998. Following his death, he was lauded by world leaders as \"the greatest European leader of the second half of the 20th century\" and was honoured with an unprecedented European Act of State in his honour in Strasbourg, France, attended by the leaders of the EU's nations and other current and former world leaders. Subsequently, a Catholic requiem mass was celebrated in the Speyer Cathedral in Speyer, Germany, before Kohl was interred in the nearby Old Cemetery.\n\nHelmut Kohl was survived by his two sons Walter Kohl and Peter Kohl, and by his grandchildren Johannes and Leyla Kohl. No member of the Kohl family—Kohl's children and grandchildren—participated in any of the ceremonies, owing to a feud with Kohl's controversial new wife Maike Kohl-Richter, who had among other things barred them from paying their respects to him at his house, ignored their wish for a ceremony in Berlin and their wish that Kohl should be interred alongside his parents and his wife of four decades Hannelore Kohl in the family tomb.\n\nDomestic\n\nInternational\n\nOrganization\n\nKohl was honoured with an unprecedented European act of state in his honour in Strasbourg, attended by the leaders of the EU's nations and other current and former world leaders. Planned as a \"grand ceremony\" co-organised by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council, it took place at the European Parliament on 1 July 2017. Speakers included Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, President of France Emmanuel Macron, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani, President of the European Council Donald Tusk and former President of the United States Bill Clinton.\n\nA Catholic requiem mass was celebrated in the Speyer Cathedral in Speyer, Germany. It was broadcast on television.\n\nThe Kohl family—Kohl's children and grandchildren—favoured a burial in the family tomb in Ludwigshafen where both of Kohl's parents, his grandparents and his wife of 41 years Hannelore Kohl are interred.\n\nKohl's controversial second wife Maike Kohl-Richter however insisted on a burial in a separate tomb in Speyer. After the Church had turned down her request to bury Kohl inside the Speyer Cathedral alongside several Holy Roman Emperors, she decided on a burial in the nearby Old Cemetery.\n\nControversy was caused when Helmut Kohl's controversial new wife Maike Kohl-Richter (formerly Richter) prevented Kohl's children and grandchildren from paying their respects to their deceased father and grandfather. In a statement to the media, Kohl's son Walter Kohl accused her of \"tasteless behaviour.\" Maike Richter was also criticized for attempting to take full control of the memorial ceremony in Strasbourg, and for denying Helmut Kohl a German act of state in Berlin, as desired by most German politicians, out of spite for Chancellor Angela Merkel. Richter, who is known for hard-right anti-immigrant views and for her support for Hungary's controversial Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, also attempted to bar Chancellor Merkel from speaking at the European memorial ceremony and wanted to have Orbán speaking instead. She only relented when told by confidantes that it would cause a scandal and be considered extremely inappropriate.\n\nThe Kohl family has declined to participate in the funeral in Speyer because they object to their father and grandfather not being interred next to his wife of 41 years, Hannelore Kohl. In his biography of his mother, Kohl's son Peter Kohl wrote that Maike Richter seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with his father and compared her to a stalker who had ensnared his father. The Kohl family, unlike Maike Richter, also supports a state ceremony in Berlin.\n"}

Her surname changed to Smith when she was about two years old, when her mother married her stepfather, and he adopted her. Dilana used singing as an escape from an unpleasant home scene, participating in school choir competitions and festivals, as well as church choir and fondue parties.\n\nWhen the opportunity presented itself, Dilana dropped everything and started performing full-time, from a travelling duo, to a mixture of bands in South Africa and the Netherlands. Moving to the Netherlands, she formed her own band, focusing more on original works and becoming one of the country's highest paid live performers.\n\nRecording her first album \"Wonderfool\" in 2000 led to four music videos, five singles and well over 200 gigs. She also sang the title tracks for two major motion pictures and performed in a festival in Belgium supporting Joe Cocker and Stuff, K's Choice and Heather Nova to a crowd of more than 100,000 people. Dilana also performed at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, with Dutch performers.\n\nDilana was one of the finalists on the CBS reality television show of season two of \"Rock Star\", where she finished runner-up to Lukas Rossi. The show is a competition in which the band chooses a lead singer from a group of contestants. Although Dilana received the most consistent praise for her performances of all the contestants, she came under fire from fans, her competition, and from Rock Star Supernova because of comments she made during a staged press conference, in which she was forthcoming with her opinion of her competitors. Although she apologised repeatedly for her remarks afterwards, it appears that her first \"bottom three\" appearance was a result of this controversy. The controversy seemed to die down by the end of the program; on the final night of voting, she was said to have received the highest number of votes at least at one point during the evening, and ended up with the second highest number overall. After the show, Gilby Clarke revealed that Lukas Rossi defeated Dilana because \"he made [their] music sound more like a band, whereas Dilana sounded like a singer, with Rock Star Supernova backing her.\"\n\nFollowing her participation on \"Rock Star\", Dilana performed various venues with fellow \"\" finalist Magni; with Magni, she won an FM957 People's Choice Award for \"Gig of the Year\" in January 2007. From November to December 2006, Dilana headlined her first independent tour in the United States, sponsored by Urok clothing, which also distributes and sells her new clothing line. From January to February 2007, she opened for the Rock Star Supernova tour, playing an acoustic set with Magni on guitar. While critics generally panned Rock Star Supernova, Dilana's performances were met with positive reception. Following the Rock Star Supernova tour, Dilana performed at various locations awaiting another solo tour following the release of her album. This included opening for the band Aerosmith on 28 April 2007 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. In 2008, she performed at several charity events for Livin' the Music in Nashville, Los Angeles, and Baton Rouge.\n\nDilana starred in her first movie entitled \"Angel Camouflaged\" which was filmed in Charleston, South Carolina on 23 October 2009. This was an independent project by a Beaufort, SC filmmaker. \"Angel Camouflaged\" was released on 28 July 2010.\n\nDilana new album \"Inside Out\" was digitally released on 17 November 2009. \"Inside Out\", originally entitled \"Darklight\", was recorded in Los Angeles and features No Doubt drummer Adrian Young, Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars and producer Dave Bassett. Although Dilana signed a contract with London-based Hurricane Records (Hurricane Music Group Ltd) in early 2008 [2] and was finished with recording her new album already in mid 2008, it was not released by said record company. In a later update from Dilana on hardrockhideout.com [3] she announced that not only did she get released from her contract with HMG due to the label's shutdown but also that the master recordings did not belong to her. Dilana then went into negotiations with Kabunk Records, LLC. Although Dilana was unable to sign a deal with Kabunk, the label did purchase the rights to the Inside Out album and will be releasing the album digitally.\n\nReception of the album has been initially, very positive. Music Reviewer Albert Watson, from Metromix music, writes,\n\nDilana has also released a series of singles, many of which will not be included on her debut album. Dilana has released covers of Johnny Cash's \"Ring of Fire\" and The Police classic \"Roxanne\". Dilana was also featured on a re-recording of \"Black\", a track on Gilby Clarke's best-of album released 30 January. Dilana also released a version of \"Killer Queen\"; her version was featured on the final episode of the UK edition of \"When Woman Rule The World\" and the Women's Tennis Championship on Versus TV Network (formerly OLN) in November 2007. On Tuesday, 9 June 2009, Dilana released an original entitled \"Hangover\" on the AO Recordings label via iTunes.\n\nIn 2009, Dilana began to receive some national exposure because of \"American Idol\" as two contestants on the show credit her during post-\"Idol\" interviews. \"American Idol\" Season 8 contestant Adam Lambert sang an arrangement of \"Ring of Fire\" very similar to the one Dilana performed. In an interview with Michael Slezak of \"Entertainment Weekly\", Adam says he liked Dilana's arrangement a lot and that it was a source of inspiration for his cover of the song. Adam's cover of \"Ring of Fire\" did not go unnoticed by Dilana nor her record label:\n\nAllison Iraheta, another \"American Idol\" Season 8 contestant, covered Dilana's song \"Holiday\" on her debut album, \"Just Like You\", slated for a 1 December 2009 release date. In an interview with Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music, who tells Allison that her cover of \"Holiday\" is the song on \"Just Like You\" she's most excited about because it's a cover of a Dilana song, said,\n\nLater in the same interview, Allison said, \"it is a little intimidating (to cover a song by someone you respect) at first cause I was like 'wow, this is so good,' but we're different.\" Dilana has said that Allison is \"the only chic I would ever want to cover my song,\" calling her \"so smart ... so talented\" and saying that she had a \"beautiful future ahead.\"\n\nDilana participated in The Voice Holland, season 7 (2016-2017) passing through the Blind Audition, The Battle rounds, but got sick on the day and left the show after The Knockout performance of \"It Must Have Been Love\". \n\n"}

Kunz has published around the world in Dutch, English, French, German, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n\nDora van Gelder was born at a sugar cane plantation named Krebet near Djombang city on East Java in the Dutch East Indies. Her father, Karel van Gelder, was a chemist who ran the sugar plantation, and her mother, born Melanie van Motman, was from a very well-to-do Dutch family as well. Both her parents had been members of the Theosophical Society since 1900 and from the age of 5 meditation became a daily routine. Dora claimed that since she was a child she interacted with ethereal beings and her mother was a strong believer in her clairvoyance. At eleven years old she moved to Mosman, a suburb of Sydney (Australia), to study with someone knowledgeable about her abilities, the then-Anglican clergyman and psychic C. W. Leadbeater, who taught her ways to increase her psychic skills.\n\nThrough Leadbeater she met Fritz Kunz, who used to accompany Leadbeater on his travels. In 1927, at the age of twenty-two, Dora moved with Kunz to the United States where they married in Chicago on May 16. She was still a Dutch citizen but sometime after the marriage became a naturalized American. Her husband became the principal of a scholastic foundation and she became president of a corporation related to pedagogic supplies. Soon after coming to the USA, the couple founded the first theosophical camp at Orcas Island in the state of Washington.\n\nFor many years, Dora dealt with new methods in healing, particularly therapeutic touch, which she co-developed in 1972 with Dr. Dolores Krieger, a nursing professor at New York University, which is said to promote healing, relaxation and lessen pain. Therapeutic touch, stated Kunz, has its origin from ancient Yogic texts written in Sanskrit, which describe it as a pranic healing method. The technique is taught in approximately eighty colleges and universities in the U.S., and in more than seventy countries.\n\nKunz philanthropically directed her clairvoyance towards helping physicians in complicated medical cases, in particular aiding in diagnoses through her capability of seeing the effects of diseases in the aura of the patients. More specifically she reported the existence of centers of energy in human body, also known as chakras, changing their colors according to diseases that affect matching endocrine glands. Her followers believed she was able to predict some illness as many as eighteen months before symptoms manifest themselves.\n\nIn 1975 Kunz became president of the Theosophical Society in America. In 1977 she published a book about her fairy experiences in her youth, \"The Real World of Fairies\", in which she stated that throughout her life she always kept in communication with nature spirits. According to her, in 1979 she saw fairies in Central Park in New York City, but due to the increasing pollution it was getting more difficult. Kunz claims that devas are intimately connected with a vital energy, transmitting force to preserve and heal the Earth. She said as more people get involved with environmental causes, the better are the chances of communication between humans and devas. In 1987 after completing twelve years as president of the Theosophical Society in America, she retired and devoted herself to lecturing and writing.\n\nThe healing method, the \"Therapeutic Touch\" conceived by Dolores Krieger and Dora Kunz in the early 1970s using the \"human energy field\"\nwas tested in 1996 by Emily Rosa. At age nine Rosa conceived and executed a scientific study of therapeutic touch which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998. It was a critique of all of the studies related to TT she could locate in nursing journals and elsewhere. This made Rosa the youngest person to have a research paper published in a peer reviewed medical journal. She concluded as her opinion:<br>\n\"The more rigorous the research design, the more detailed the statistical analysis, the less evidence that there is any observed—or observable—phenomenon.\" She just could not see it.\n\n\n\n"}

On attaining his Abitur, Friedrich-Wend joined the 1st Guards Infantry Division in 1902 and a year later the Kriegsschule in Engers. In 1906 he withdrew from the military with the rank of Lieutenant of Reserves.\n\nDuring his time in Vienna he had met his later wife, the Austrian Marie von Mayr-Melnhof (1884 -1960). Marie came from the family of the Barons of Mayr von Melnhof that had risen in society very rapidly some decades before; having been the peasants Mayr of the Melnhof, they succeeded in paving the way for the industrialisation of Styria, and thus acquired a vast fortune. This fortune was invested in large areas of forestry and formed the basis of the Mayr-Melnhof company today.\n\nWedding of Friedrich-Wend and Marie took place on 21 My 1904 at Liebenberg in the presence of the Emperor Wilhelm II. Because of the bride's Catholic confession, it had been a problematic union, as Wilhelm II had elevated his friend Philip zu Eulenberg to the rank of prince just a few years earlier in an attempt to create parity between the Catholic and Protestant peers of the empire. The impending marriage appeared to threaten this equilibrium, whereupon Wilhelm at first forbade it. The Emperor himself thereupon sought a solution by asking Pope Pius X to grant an exception. This led to the marriage being celebrated in both confessions and all the children were later baptised in the Protestant faith. Immediately thereafter, between 1904 and 1906 the so-called Lake House, was built for the young couple on the shores of a lake close to the family estate, the costs being met by the bridal dowry.\n\nAfter his wedding, Friedrich-Wend set out on a course of agricultural studies at the University of Halle, that he was, however, unable to complete. The dramatic events of Harden-Eulenburg affair involving his father in the period between 1907 and 1909 made it necessary for him to be present with his family, for the two older sons were often called upon to physically protect their father from the surge of Paparazzi. The family doctor, Wilhelm zur Linden, writes in his memoirs that he was still treating the after-effects of the shock in Friedrich-Wend in the year 1937. So at the age of 26, Friedrich-Wend took over full responsibility for the family affairs, erecting a brickworks the following year and beginning with the mechanisation of the agricultural estate.\n\nIn the course of the general mobilisation, he was called for active service in August 1914. His regiment advanced through Belgium and reached Ghent during the offensive, after which he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st. Class. Soon after this he was poisoned by locals. For months he could only take in fluids and only regained his health after many years. In June 1915 his younger brother, Botho Sigwart fell in Galicia when a shot pierced his lung. His death brought considerable consequences for the family, who had been close to Rudolf Steiner and received him as guest at Liebenberg estate occasionally since 1906. Sigwart had been an avid student of Anthroposophy together with two of his sisters, Tora and Lyki and with his sister-in-law, Marie, the wife of Friedrich-Wend. Soon after he died, they felt he was trying to communicate with them from the world beyond, made extensive notes and showed these to Rudolf Steiner. The three volumes \"Bridge Over the River\" give an account of these communications.\n\nAfter the First World War, things changed considerably also for the circumstances at Liebenberg, which was no longer competitive. Friedrich-Wend, heir to the title after the death of his father in 1921, engaged an external consultant in 1925, Rudolf, Baron of Engelhardt-Schönheyden, under whose management the estate was successfully upgraded. In 1926 Engelhardt married the daughter of his employer, Ingeborg, Countess zu Eulenburg and moved with her into one wing of the Lake House.\n\nAs a monarchist, Eulenburg was a member of and involved with the conservative German National People's Party (DNVP). He soon realised, however, that the influence of the large landowners could only be maintained if they had broad basis of support amongst the masses. He saw in the Nazi Party (NSDAP), that had already outdistanced the DNVP during the 1930 elections, a political force that could secure this broad popular consent. He therefore met with Adolf Hitler in 1931 in order to address the interests of the big landowners: \n\nAfter this conversation, Friedrich-Wend believed to have found in Hitler the right man to secure his aims. He thereupon wrote to the other landowners so as to encourage them to join the NSDAP: \n\nHe became a member of the party himself and the bulk of the population of Liebenberg later followed his example. His son-in-law, Baron von Engelhardt, had already some years earlier founded a Liebenberg branch of the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), organising field games and battle exercises.\n\nThe Eulenburg's neighbour on the next estate was Hermann Göring, who had built a country residence, Carinhall in the Schorfheide forest nearby. He would at times join the deer hunting on the Liebenberg estate. It was during one of these stays at Liebenberg that the niece of Eulenburg, Libertas Schulze-Boysen, who had spent the decisive years of her childhood with the family at Liebenberg, spoke to Göring on behalf of her fiancé, Harro Schulze-Boysen. He was in a subordinate position in Göring's Reichsluftfahrtministerium, the Ministry of Aviation, and shortly after this he was promoted. The couple were married in 1936 at Liebenberg. Six years later, Harro and Libertas were identified as the heads of the resistance group Rote Kapelle, by the Gestapo and executed in December 1942 at Plötzensee Prison.\n\nIn reaction, the only son of Friedrich-Wend, Wend, Count of Eulenburg (1908-1986), who had up to that point been classified as \"u.K.\" (indispensable), at once received his call-up papers to a Strafbattalion (penal battalion), unit that experienced an extraordinarily high rate of casualties, and was sent to the Eastern Front to combat partisans. His father continued ceaselessly to attempt to secure his transfer and Wend eventually was moved into a tank battalion that was completely wiped out during the Allied invasion of Salerno. He survived the war and was taken prisoner in April 1945 by American troops near Como.\n\nPrior to this, in 1941, Prince Eulenburg had already drawn the attention of the Nazi authorities when he signed a petition calling for the release of the priests of the Christian Community, who had been arrested as a body by the Gestapo on 10 June 1941, the churches prohibited and their property confiscated. Other notable signatories to the petition were the operatic soprano, Marta Fuchs, the two marine captains Helmuth von Ruckteschell and Hans Erdmenger together with his wife, as well as a few officials from some of the ministries. The priests had been released from captivity some two months later, but the signatories' names had been noted by the Gestapo.\n\nFriedrich-Wend and his wife fled in April 1945 as the last of the family to leave Liebenberg right before the invasion of the Red Army troops. They spent the next years on their estate of Gut Kaden in Schleswig-Holstein while the Soviet military administration of Germany confiscated their properties in Liebenberg and Häsen. The family estates of Hertefeld and Kolk, as well as the forestry and hunting estates of his wife Marie in Austria were either destroyed or occupied by refugees.\n\nBy 1947 Friedrich Wend had once again built up the revenue administration of the main estate, Hertefeld, while his son Wend re-established the agricultural concerns. When the last refugees had left the estate in Hinterstoder, Upper Austria the family could once again take possession of it. Prince Eulenburg devoted the last years of his life to his family and to the hunt until his death on 1 August 1963 at Hertefeld, where he lies buried next to his wife, Marie, who had preceded him in 1961.\n\nChildren:\nGrandchildren:\nGreat-grandchildren:\n\nHis great-uncle was the Prussian Minister of the Interior Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg, and other uncles the Prussian Prime Minister (1892-1894) and Minister of the Interior Botho zu Eulenburg and the royal Prussian Oberhofmarschall August zu Eulenburg. The composer Botho Sigwart zu Eulenburg was his younger brother. The resistance fighter Libertas Schulze-Boysen, who grew up at Schloss Liebenberg, was his niece.\n\n\n"}

Sabu attended, but did not graduate from, Washington Irving High School. He had been living in his late grandmother's apartment in the Riis Houses in New York City.\n\nOn March 6, 2012, Sabu was revealed to be Hector Xavier Monsegur in a series of articles written by Jana Winter and published by FoxNews.com.\n\nFederal agents arrested Monsegur on June 7, 2011. The following day, Monsegur agreed to become an informant for the FBI and to continue his \"Sabu\" persona. \"Since literally the day he was arrested, the defendant has been cooperating with the government proactively,\" sometimes staying up all night engaging in conversations with co-conspirators to help the government build cases against them, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Pastore said at a secret bail hearing on August 5, 2011. A few days after that bail hearing, Monsegur entered a guilty plea to 12 criminal charges, including multiple counts of conspiracy to engage in computer hacking, computer hacking in furtherance of fraud, conspiracy to commit access device fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. He faced up to 124 years in prison.\n\nAs an informant, Monsegur provided the FBI with details enabling the arrest of five other hackers associated with the groups Anonymous, LulzSec and Antisec. The FBI provided its own servers for the hacking to take place. Information Monsegur provided also resulted in the arrest of two UK hackers: James Jeffery and Ryan Cleary.\n\nThe FBI attempted to use Monsegur to entrap Nadim Kobeissi, author of the secure communication software Cryptocat, but without success.\n\nMonsegur maintained his pretense until March 6, 2012, even tweeting his \"opposition\" to the federal government until the very last. The final day's tweets included, \"The feds at this moment are scouring our lives without warrants. Without judges approval. This needs to change. Asap\" and \"The federal government is run by a bunch of fucking cowards. Don't give in to these people. Fight back. Stay strong\". On March 6, 2012, the FBI announced the arrests of five male suspects: two from Britain, two from Ireland and one from the U.S.\n\nSabu has not been explicitly linked to the group Anonymous. The extent of crossover between the members of such hacktivist groups, however, is uncertain. Anonymous reacted to Sabu's unmasking and betrayal of LulzSec on Twitter, \"#Anonymous is a hydra, cut off one head and we grow two back\".\n\nSteve Fishman of \"New York\" magazine said \"On the Internet, Monsegur was now a reviled figure. At Jacob Riis, it was a different story. Those who knew him growing up were shocked—he was always 'respectful,' they said. But also, they were a little proud. In their eyes, he was a kid from the projects who'd achieved a certain success. He'd gotten out, finally.\"\n\nA court filing made by prosecutors in late May 2014 revealed Monsegur had prevented 300 cyber attacks in the three years since 2011, including planned attacks on NASA, the U.S. military and media companies. \"Monsegur's consistent and corroborated historical information, coupled with his substantial proactive cooperation and other evidence developed in the case, contributed directly to the identification, prosecution, and conviction of eight of his major co-conspirators, including Jeremy Hammond, who at the time of his arrest was the FBI's number one cyber-criminal target in the world,\" a sentencing memo among the documents filed said.\n\nMonsegur served 7 months in prison after his arrest but had been free since then while awaiting sentencing. At his sentencing on May 27, 2014, he was given \"time served\" for co-operating with the FBI and set free under one year of probation.\n"}

Her time in India, while her husband was Governor of Madras, was inspirational to her for all three of these pursuits.\n\nBorn in Oakley Park, at Bromfield, Shropshire, into a landed and titled family, she was the daughter of Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis, and Barbara, granddaughter of William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis. Her family owned a property in London and significant estates in Wales and Shropshire. Her birthplace was sold to Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive, in 1771, so Lady Henrietta spent her teenage years at the family's ancestral home, Powis Castle.\n\nLady Henrietta married Lord Clive's eldest son and heir, Edward Clive, 1st Baron Clive, in 1784. The marriage was beneficial to both families; the bride's family had a prestigious name but considerable debts, while the groom accrued wealth built during Clive's military campaigns in India. The couple settled in Walcot Hall, at Lydbury North near Bishop's Castle, Shropshire. Their four children were:\n\n\nLady Clive inherited the Herbert estates upon the death of her brother, George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis, in 1801, when the Earldom became extinct.

Her husband survived her, dying in 1839.\n\nIn 1798, Lord Clive was appointed Governor of Madras. Lady Clive followed him to India where she started collecting rocks and minerals, as the first aristocratic woman to pursue that hobby. As her collection was growing, Lady Clive contacted prominent collectors and mineral dealers, such as James Sowerby, John MacCulloch and the Countess of Aylesford. Her records show that many specimens had been given to her by her children. The minerals in Lady Clive's collection, numbering up to 1,000, are arranged systematically by chemistry, as was usual in the early 19th century. In 1817, she organised her collection in two handwritten catalogues, using numbers to identify each specimen and helping the collection remain remarkably complete to this day. A quarter of the original collection is now kept at the National Museum Wales as one of the most important historic mineral collections, having been donated by her great-grandson, George Herbert, 4th Earl of Powis, in 1929.\n\nUpon arriving in India, Lady Powis also created a garden and kept a record of the plants in the area of Mysore and the Carnatic region.\n\nLady Clive's Journals are one of the very first written accounts of India by a British woman.

His father had moved to Panyu, Guangdong to take up an official post.\nHe was qualified as juren at 21 years of age. He studied in Japan starting in 1902, and joined the Tongmenghui (Chinese Revolutionary Alliance) in 1905 as an editor of the newspaper Min Bao. From 1907 to 1910, he participated in several armed revolutions. Shortly after the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, he was appointed the governor of Guangdong and chief secretary of the Provisional Government. He participated in the Second Revolution in 1913, and followed Sun Yat-sen to Japan after the failure of that revolution. There they established the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party). Hu lived in Guangdong between 1917 and 1921 and worked for Sun Yat-sen, as the minister of transportation first and principal consultant later.\n\nHu was elected to be a central executive committee member in the first conference of the Kuomintang in January, 1924. In September, he acted as vice generalissimo, when Sun Yat-sen left Guangzhou to Shaoguan. Sun died in Beijing in March, 1925, and Hu was one of the three most powerful figures in the Kuomintang. The other two were Wang Jingwei and Liao Zhongkai. Liao was assassinated in August of the same year, and Hu was suspected and arrested. After the Ninghan split in 1927, Hu supported Chiang Kai-shek and was head of the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing.\n\nLater on February 28, 1931, Hu was placed under house arrest by Chiang because of disputes over the new provisional constitution. Internal party pressure forced Chiang to release him. After that, Hu became a powerful leader in South China, holding three political principles of resistance: resistance against Japanese invasion and massacre, resistance against militarist Communists, and finally resistance against the self-proclaimed leader, Chiang Kai-shek. The anti-Chiang factions in the KMT converged on Guangzhou to set up a rival government. They demanded Chiang's resignation from his dual posts of president and premier. Civil war was averted by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Hu continued to rule southern China, the heartland of the KMT, with the help of Chen Jitang and the New Guangxi clique. There he attempted to create a model government free of corruption and cronyism to discredit Chiang's Nanjing regime.\n\nHu was an advocate of action against Japanese aggression, criticizing Chiang for \"his spineless failure to adopt a strong policy towards the foreign power which has torn and ravaged our homeland!\"\n\nHu visited Europe and stopped his political attack on Chiang Kai-shek in June, 1935. In the first session of the fifth conference of Kuomintang in December 1935, he was absently elected as the Chair of Central Committee of Common Affairs. Hu returned to China in January, 1936, and lived in Guangzhou until he died of cerebral hemorrhage on May 12, 1936.\n\nHis death sparked a crisis. Chiang wanted to replace Hu with loyal followers in southern China and end the autonomy the south enjoyed under Hu. As a result, Chen and the New Guangxi clique conspired to remove Chiang from office. In the so-called \"Liangguang Incident\", Chen was forced to resign as governor of Guangdong after Chiang bribed many of Chen's officers to defect and the conspiracy collapsed.\n\nHu's political philosophy was that one's individual rights are a function of one's membership in a nation.\n"}

In 1902 he started at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), where he obtained a law degree in 1907. Already as a student he had become interested in the Flemish movement, like his father Julius Hoste Sr. While he was a student, he was a member of \"Geen Taal, Geen Vrijheid\", and together with Nico Gunzburg and Frans Van Cauwelaert, he founded the \"Algemeen Vlaams Studentenbond\".\n\nAfter Hoste graduated, he worked shortly for the bar, but soon started working for the newspaper company founded by his father, which published newspapers such as Het Laatste Nieuws, \"De Vlaamsche Gazet van Brussel\" and \"De Zweep\" (a Flemish weekly). In 1909, he cofounded the \"Liberale Volksbond\" of the district Brussels. This organization was founded in reaction to the \"Franskiljonism\" of the Liberal Party of Brussels. In 1913, he also participated in the foundation of the Liberaal Vlaams Verbond.\n\nDuring World War I, he lived in the Netherlands. He worked for the newspaper \"De Vlaamsche Stem\" until it began German-sponsored activism. In reaction he and Frans Van Cauwelaert founded the newspaper \"Vrij België\". Together they also founded the \"Vlaams-Belgisch Verbond\", and worked on the \"minimumprogramma\" (E: minimum-program) to establish linguistic uniformity in Flanders (Dutch) and Wallonia (French), Dutch-language usage in Flanders for education, administration, justice and army. After the war this remained the program for the \"Vlaams-Belgisch Verbond\".\n\nAfter the war Hoste took over the management of the publishing company, and \"Het Laatste Nieuws\" became the most popular newspaper in Flanders. The success of the newspaper stood in strong contrast to the bad results for the liberals in Brussels in the elections of 1920. Julius Hoste would become president of the \"Algemene Belgische persbond\" (1935–1936), and secretary of the \"Verbond der Brusselse dagbladbestuurders\" (1939).\n\nIn 1935 he entered the political scene, and campaigned against the fascist parties Rex and VNV, and in 1936 became \"Minister of Education\" in the second government of Paul Van Zeeland. While he was in office, he founded the Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie voor Wetenschappen, Letteren en Schone Kunsten and a Dutch and French \"cultural council\" (1938).\n\nDuring World War II he stayed in Great Britain, where he became the under-secretary for education in the Belgian government in exile. After the war, he helped reestablish the \"Liberale Volksbond\" and the Liberaal Vlaams Verbond. In 1947, he was one of the main authors of the Oxford Manifesto on liberalism. In 1949 he was chosen as liberal senator for Brussels, which he remained until his death in 1954. As a politician he paid attention to the problems of the Belgian communities (Flanders and Wallonia) and world peace during the Cold War.\n\n"}

According to Hagin's testimony, he was born with a deformed heart and what was believed to be an incurable blood disease. He was not expected to live and at age 15 became paralyzed and bedridden. In April 1933 he converted to Christianity. During a dramatic conversion experience, he reported dying, due to the deformed heart, three times in 10 minutes, each time seeing the horrors of hell and then returning to life. He remained paralyzed after his conversion.\n\nOn August 8, 1934, he says he was raised from his deathbed by a revelation of \"faith in God's Word\" after reading Mark 11:23-24.\n\nThe Bible scripture in defined his ministry and was his most frequently quoted verse:\n\nIn 1936, he founded his first non-denominational church. He preached his first sermon as the pastor of a small, community Baptist church in Roland, Texas. In 1937, he became an Assemblies of God minister. During the next twelve years he pastored five Assemblies of God churches in Texas: in the cities of Tom Bean, Farmersville (twice), Talco, Greggton, and Van. Van, Texas was the last church he pastored before starting to travel.\n\nOn November 25, 1938 he married Oretha Rooker. They had two children.

His son Kenneth Wayne Hagin is currently the pastor of Rhema Bible Church and President of Kenneth Hagin Ministries.\n\nHagin began an itinerant ministry as a Bible teacher and evangelist in 1949 after an appearance by Jesus. He joined the Voice of Healing Revival in the U.S. with Oral Roberts, Gordon Lindsay and T. L. Osborn between 1947 and 1958. \n\nHagin was given full admission to the Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International (also known as the FGBMFI) which had been established in 1951.\n\nOn January 23, 1963, he formed the Kenneth E. Hagin Evangelistic Association (now Kenneth Hagin Ministries) in Garland, Texas. In September 1966, the ministry offices were moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma into a space previously used by T.L. Osborn. He started selling his sermons on reel-to-reel tape in 1966. In November of that year, he taught for the first time on radio on KSKY in Dallas. \n\nThe North Texas District Council of the Assemblies of God ordained him a minister in 1967. \n\nIn 1967, he began a regular radio broadcast that still continues as \"Faith Seminar of the Air.\" Teaching by his son, Rev.

{"id": "161230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161230", "title": "Lance Bass", "text": "Lance Bass\n\nJames Lance Bass (; born May 4, 1979) is an American singer, dancer, actor, film and television producer, and author. He grew up in Mississippi and rose to fame as the bass singer for the American pop boy band NSYNC. NSYNC's success led Bass to work in film and television. He starred in the 2001 film \"On the Line\", which his company, Bacon & Eggs, also produced. Bass later formed a second production company, Lance Bass Productions, as well as a now-defunct music management company, Free Lance Entertainment, a joint venture with Mercury Records.\n\nAfter completion of NSYNC's PopOdyssey Tour, Bass moved to Star City, Russia, in much publicized pursuit of a seat on a Soyuz space capsule. Bass was certified by both NASA and the Russian Space Program after several months of cosmonaut training, and planned to join the TMA-1 mission to the International Space Station. However, after his financial sponsors backed out, Bass was denied a seat on the mission.\n\nIn July 2006, Bass came out as gay in a cover story for \"People\" magazine. He was awarded the Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award in October 2006, and released an autobiography, \"Out of Sync\", in October 2007, which debuted on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list.\n\nJames Lance Bass was born in Laurel, Mississippi, to James Irvin Bass, Jr., a medical technologist, and Diane (née Pulliam), a middle school mathematics, English, and career discovery teacher. Along with his older sister, Stacy, Bass grew up in adjacent Ellisville, Mississippi, and was raised as a Southern Baptist. Bass has described his family as devoutly Christian and conservative and has said that his childhood was \"extremely happy\". As a young boy, Bass developed an interest in space, and at age 9 traveled to Cape Canaveral, Florida, with his father to watch his first live space shuttle launch. Of this experience Bass said, \"I was certain from then on that my future was to be involved with space.\" Shortly after, Bass attended space camp in Titusville, Florida, and aspired to attend college and study engineering, with the hope that he would one day work for NASA.\n\nWhen Bass was 11 years old, his father was transferred to a different hospital, and the family moved to Clinton, Mississippi Bass began singing in his Baptist church choir, and was encouraged to audition for local performance groups by his childhood best friend, Darren Dale, the youngest child of former longtime Mississippi Insurance Commissioner George Dale. Bass joined the Mississippi Show Stoppers, a statewide music group sponsored by the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum, and the Attaché Show Choir, a national-award-winning competitive show choir group at Clinton High School. He was also a member of a seven-man vocal group named Seven Card Stud, which competed at state fairs and performed at several social and political events for Senator Trent Lott.\n\nAt Clinton High School, Bass was elected vice president of his junior class and has said that he performed well in math and science. However, Bass later stated that his primary focus during high school was singing, and when looking back, he remembers \"hardly anything\" about academia.\n\nBass's music career has consisted primarily of his singing with NSYNC and running a small management company.\n\nIn 1995, during his junior year of high school, Bass received a call from Justin Timberlake and his mother, Lynn Harless, who asked Bass if he would be interested in auditioning for the pop group NSYNC after the group's original bass singer, Jason Galasso, had quit. Timberlake's vocal coach (who had worked with Bass during his time as a Mississippi Show Stopper) recommended Bass as a replacement. Bass was accepted into the group after auditioning in front of the other bandmembers and Lou Pearlman, and soon left school to move to Orlando, Florida, and rehearse full-time. Bass has said that he did not know how to dance before he joined NSYNC, and therefore found much of the group's choreography difficult to learn. According to an episode of VH1's \"Driven\", Jan Boltz, president of BMG's German division, offered NSYNC a recording contract under the condition that they replace Bass, whose dancing, he felt, \"wasn't at the same level as all the others.\" However, the other members of the group refused to accept the contract without Bass, and the group's manager, Johnny Wright, convinced Bolz that Bass's dancing would quickly improve. Bolz conceded, and the group soon moved to Munich, Germany to record their first album with BMG. 'N Sync began extensive touring in Europe, and Bass's mother quit her job to tour with the group as a chaperone, as Bass was still a minor.\n\nAfter gaining significant notability in Europe, NSYNC was signed to American record label RCA in 1997. The group's first single, \"I Want You Back\" began receiving major radio play in the United States, and NSYNC soon found themselves becoming an \"overnight sensation\", a period which Bass describes in his autobiography as \"the death of my own innocence\". Along with increasing fame and recognition in the United States the band also experienced a highly publicized legal battle with Pearlman, due to what the group believed were illicit business practices on his part. NSYNC sued Pearlman and his record company, Trans Continental, for defrauding the group of more than 50% of their earnings, rather than his original promise of only receiving one-sixth of the profits. The group threatened to leave and sign with Jive Records, which prompted Pearlman and RCA to countersue NSYNC for $150 million US, citing breach of contract. The injunction was thrown out of court and, after winning back their earnings, NSYNC signed with Jive.\n\nIn March 2000, NSYNC released \"No Strings Attached\", which became the fastest-selling record of all time, selling 1.1 million copies in its first day of release. In 2001, the group followed up with their \"Celebrity\" album, which scored the second highest first-week album sales ever, trumped only by the group's previous album. NSYNC went on to sell over 56 million records worldwide. In 2002, the group announced that they would be taking a \"hiatus\", during which Timberlake began to record solo material. 'N Sync has not recorded new material since, and Bass has stated that he feels the group has officially disbanded.\n\nIn 2007, Bass stated that he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 decision to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has also said that he has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has \"made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon.\" Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: \"At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I'm really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don't hate him at all. And I understand what he was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us.\"\n\nIn 2000, Bass formed a music management company named Free Lance Entertainment, which was a joint venture with Mercury Nashville, a division of Mercury Records. Vowing to keep the company \"a strictly family-run operation,\" Bass employed his parents and sister as talent scouts, and recruited childhood friend and aspiring country singer Meredith Edwards for the company's first release. Edwards began touring with NSYNC as an opening act in the fall of 2000, and Bass teamed up with MTV to hold a nationwide talent search for more artists later that year. However, Free Lance soon folded after disappointing sales of Edwards's debut album, \"Reach\".\n\nBass guest-starred on the WB drama series \"7th Heaven\", playing Rick Palmer, a love interest for Beverley Mitchell's character, Lucy. The following year, while NSYNC was in the midst of recording \"Celebrity\", Bass received his first starring role in the 2001 motion picture \"On The Line\". Bass played Kevin, a man who falls in love with a woman on a Chicago train and begins a search to find her again. The film was produced by Bass's production company, A Happy Place (later renamed Bacon & Eggs), and featured appearances by Jerry Stiller, Al Green, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, former WWE wrestler Chyna, and Bass's bandmates Timberlake, Kirkpatrick and Fatone, the latter in a major role. The film also featured a soundtrack which included previously unreleased songs by NSYNC and Britney Spears. Bass collaborated with Joey Fatone, Mandy Moore, Christian Burns and True Vibe (as the \"On The Line Allstars\") for the film's theme song, \"On The Line\".\n\nDespite heavy marketing towards NSYNC teen fans, the film was a commercial failure, grossing only $4.2 million US domestically despite its $10 million US budget. The film, along with Bass's acting, was also poorly received by critics. Bass later said that he felt the film's success was greatly hindered by its release date, which came one week after the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001. In his 2007 autobiography, Bass wrote, \"That was it – our film was finished... once the country went to war, there was no way our film was going to be on anyone's top-priority list.\"\n\nAfter \"On The Line\", Bass appeared in \"Zoolander\" and Wes Craven's \"Cursed\" as himself, and played a wedding singer in \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry\". Bass has also lent his voice to several animated television programs, such as \"Robot Chicken\" and Disney's \"Kim Possible\", \"Handy Manny\" and \"Higglytown Heroes\". In the video game realm, Bass voiced the \"Final Fantasy VII\" character Sephiroth in \"Kingdom Hearts\". On August 14, 2007, Bass began a six-month stint playing Corny Collins in the Broadway musical \"Hairspray\", coinciding with the play's five-year stage anniversary. He ended his run in \"Hairspray\" on January 6, 2008. Bass made an appearance in the 2008 film \"Tropic Thunder\". As a guest star in the 2013 \"Gravity Falls\" episode \"Boyz Crazy\", Bass plays in the boy band, Sev'ral Timez (which is a parody of NSYNC). In 2014, Bass guest starred on an episode of the Comedy Central series, \"Review\", in which he visited space along with the show's lead character.\n\nIn 2015, Bass joined season two of \"The Meredith Vieira Show\" as a full-time contributing panelist.\n\nBass and his mother competed with other duos in the FOX reality cooking series \"My Kitchen Rules\".\n\nBass was a contestant on Season 7 of \"Dancing with the Stars\", and was paired with swing dance champ Lacey Schwimmer. Bass and Schwimmer reached the grand finale in competition with Brooke Burke partnering with Derek Hough and Warren Sapp partnering with Kym Johnson. Lance Bass finished in third place with the title going to Burke.\n\nIn January 2001, Bass formed his first film production company, A Happy Place, with film producers Rich Hull, Wendy Thorlakson and Joe Anderson. The company was geared towards family-friendly films, and received the Movieguide award for \"Excellence in Family-Oriented Programming\" for its first feature film, \"On the Line\". After \"On The Line\", A Happy Place changed its name to Bacon & Eggs and produced its second feature film, \"Lovewrecked\", in 2005. The film debuted on the ABC Family Channel in January 2007, and starred Amanda Bynes, Chris Carmack and Jamie-Lynn Sigler, with Bass in a minor role. This too received mostly negative reviews.\n\nBass later formed a separate production company named Lance Bass Productions. On May 14, 2007, Brian Graden announced that Lance Bass Productions would be working with the Logo network in executive producing a reality television show about the music business. It was reported that the show will focus on the creation and development of an all-gay boy band. To date no such project has been developed or aired.\n\nIn 2008, Bass co-produced \"The Grand\", and Bass's company is reported to be developing a music docudrama about the life of rock bands on tour.\n\nIn October 2011, Bass debuted his own boy band called Heart2Heart. In August 2013, Bass became an executive producer of the documentary film \"Kidnapped for Christ\" along with Mike C. Manning. The film sheds light on controversial behavior modification methods used on children, sent there by their parents, at an Evangelical Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic. The film was sold to Showtime, to be released on television July 10, 2014.\n\nBass hosted \"Dirty Pop with Lance Bass\", a daily evening drive time radio show focusing on pop culture and entertainment news on OutQ, a LGBT-geared station on Sirius XM. Bass was also the host of the weekly \"Pop2Kountdown\" on Pop2K, which counts down the 30 biggest hits from that week from a different year in the 2000s.\n\nBass dated actress Danielle Fishel of TV's \"Boy Meets World\" throughout 1999 and 2000. Fishel stated that she was heavily invested in the relationship, commenting that she was \"so in love\" with Bass. Bass ended the relationship after one year, and continued to exclusively date women until he was 22.\n\nIn his autobiography, Bass documents two gay relationships that predated media speculation; one with a Miami, Florida, native named Jesse, with whom Bass lived for two years, and another with an Idaho native named Joe. Bass began dating \"Amazing Race\" winner Reichen Lehmkuhl in early 2006, a courtship that garnered tabloid coverage and led to Bass's decision to come out. Bass described his relationship with Lehmkuhl as \"very stable\"; however, the couple split several months later. Shortly after his split with Lehmkuhl, Bass briefly dated Brazilian model and LXTV host Pedro Andrade. From August 2007 to March 2008, Bass dated New York-based hairdresser Ben Thigpen. After a year and a half of dating, Bass became engaged to Michael Turchin in September 2013. Bass and Turchin married on December 20, 2014 in Los Angeles.\n\nIn a 2006 interview, Bass stated that he has Attention-Deficit Disorder. Bass's favorite music bands are Aerosmith, the Goo Goo Dolls, and Journey, and his favorite actress is Lucille Ball, whom he grew up watching on \"I Love Lucy\" re-runs. He is a self-described \"huge Dr. Seuss fan\", devoting an entire room in his Jackson, Mississippi estate to Seuss memorabilia. Bass has said that he is a Christian and that he regularly attends church, though he considers himself to be non-denominational. He is the godfather of former bandmate Joey Fatone's daughters, Briahna and Kloey. Bass and Fatone are best friends.\n\nBass came out as gay in a cover story for \"People\" magazine on July 26, 2006. There had been considerable media speculation about his orientation due to numerous paparazzi snapshots of him at gay bars and nightclubs, most notably during the preceding Independence Day weekend in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton had also been posting items on his website about Bass's orientation since September 2005, and New York gossip column \"Page Six\" ran a blurb on July 12, 2006, that reported a sighting of Bass at a gay bar with his then-boyfriend, Reichen Lehmkuhl. Bass's publicist, Ken Sunshine, chose to release the story exclusively to \"People\" magazine, who bumped actor Johnny Depp off that week's cover in favor of Bass. In his coming out interview, Bass stated,\n\nBass's announcement received a large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving \"overwhelming support\" from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as \"straight-acting\" in his \"People\" interview, stating, \"I call them the SAGs – the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer.\" This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with \"The Advocate\", Bass called his comment a \"mistake\" and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, \"Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed.\"\n\nBass found himself in the midst of further controversy later that year when he, along with then-boyfriend Reichen Lehmkuhl, was awarded the 2006 Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award on October 7, 2006. The \"Washington Blade\" printed a guest editorial from a long-time HRC supporter who claimed that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and that The Human Rights Campaign was simply capitalizing on Bass's fame to sell tickets. The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award, responding to critics by saying, \"Bass is the biggest music star since Melissa Etheridge to come out, and maybe some people think HRC should just ignore these moments of cultural significance, but his declaration did initiate a positive, national conversation that continues today.\"\n\nBass began dating painter and actor Michael Turchin in January 2011 and they became engaged in September 2013. They married on December 20, 2014 at the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. Former NSYNC bandmates Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and JC Chasez were in attendance; Justin Timberlake, who was then headlining his The 20/20 Experience World Tour, was not present. The ceremonial event was filmed and televised in a special E! presentation: \"Lance Loves Michael: The Lance Bass Wedding\" that aired on February 5, 2015. Bass and Turchin were the first same-sex couple to exchange vows on cable television. After four years of marriage, the couple decided to extend their family and have a child with the help of a surrogate.\n\nIn February 2002, Lena Banks, a space advocate and founder/producer of Think Tank Ink Productions, contacted Lance Bass to propose his involvement in her Youngest Person in Space project. Banks brought her longtime associate David Krieff of Destiny Productions on board and through a series of events in August 2002, Bass entered cosmonaut training in Star City, Russia. Bass was considered as the US host of a space competition show to be entitled \"The Big Mission\", which had been successful in Denmark, in which several contestants would go through rigorous training in order to win a seat on a Russian Soyuz space capsule. However, the game show concept was reconsidered, as the producers of the show decided it would be a much better idea to shoot a documentary of a celebrity actually training and going into space, and airing it on a major network. Lena Banks came up with the idea of the Youngest Person in Space many years before Dennis Tito had his historical flight. Through a series of events in early 2002 the chance of using Bass was presented when a colleague mentioned her space project to a friend and the friend's daughter shouted out, \"Lance Bass wants to go into space!\" The girl, who was an NSYNC fan, learned of Bass' lifelong dream of space travel when she read it online via a MTV forum. Lena Banks spoke to Lance Bass's management who then went to him with the proposal. \"At first he thought we were joking,\" Lena Banks remarks. \"I assured him it was for real; he accepted and we moved forward with the project.\"\n\nIn order to be admitted into training, Bass had to go through strenuous physicals that saved his life. It was discovered he had cardiac arrhythmia, and he agreed to undergo heart surgery to correct it. Prior to this, in 1999, he collapsed after a concert because of his condition. After several months of training, Bass received cosmonaut certification and went on to Houston's Johnson Space Center (JSC) to take part in astronaut training. He was scheduled to fly into space on the Soyuz TMA-1 mission that was to be launched on October 30, 2002. The capsule was scheduled to fly to the International Space Station and land in a desert in Kazakhstan.\n\nSeveral months before Bass was scheduled to fly, the original deal to air the documentary about Bass fell through. Bass's camp turned to MTV, who initially agreed to sponsor the trip but then backed out over \"payment, insurance, and indemnification issues.\" Shortly after, all of Bass's other sponsorships fell through, including one sponsor that pulled out because they worried about the image of their brand possibly being tarnished if Bass were to die on the mission. Bass was eventually rejected from the program, and was replaced on the flight by Russian cosmonauts Yury Lonchakov, Sergei Zalyotin and Belgium's Frank De Winne.\n\nIn 2003, Bass began serving as World Space Week's Youth Spokesman. Bass has stated that he believes young people becoming more interested in space exploration \"will help the future of our planet\". From 2003 to 2005, Bass spent World Space Week traveling to American high schools speaking with students about space exploration and encouraging them to explore careers in the fields of science and mathematics. Bass is a member of the National Space Society, a non-profit educational space advocacy organization founded by Dr. Wernher von Braun. Bass has served on the National Space Society's Board of governors since October 2004, alongside other space advocates such as actor Tom Hanks and author and futurist Sir Arthur C. Clarke. In a 2007 interview with \"GQ\" magazine, Bass stated that he \"absolutely\" still intends on going to space, and that he hopes to work on a space documentary. Bass has also retained fluency in Russian, which he was required to learn during his training.\n\nFollowing public response surrounding his coming out, Bass announced that he was releasing an autobiography. The book, entitled \"Out of Sync\", was published on October 23, 2007. It was co-written by \"The New York Times\" best-selling biographer Marc Eliot, who also wrote the book's introduction, and was published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment, a division of Simon & Schuster. The 208-page book covers what Bass describes as \"the first chapter\" in his life, from his childhood growing up in rural Mississippi, to his efforts to obtain a seat on a Russian space capsule and the proceeding financial issues he had with his sponsors, and culminating with Bass's decision to go public with his sexuality. The book includes details about boyfriends that he kept from family and friends, and recounts NSYNC's 2002 decision to go on an \"extended hiatus\". Bass stated that Justin Timberlake was the sole reason NSYNC did not get back together. \"Out of Sync\" debuted on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list for the week of November 11, 2007.\n\nBass has been involved with a number of charities during his career. In 2001, Bass founded The Lance Bass Foundation, a non-profit organization that was designed to meet the health needs of low-income children. In 2003, Bass donated $30,000 US to establish the Amber Pulliam Special Education Endowment at The University of Southern Mississippi. The endowment is in honor of his younger cousin, Amber Pulliam, who has Down syndrome, and was established to financially aid students from Mississippi's Pine Belt who plan a career in special education.\n\nAfter 2005's Hurricane Katrina, Bass launched \"uBid For Hurricane Relief\", a celebrity auction to benefit victims of the hurricane, with uBid.com. Proceeds from the auction were split between the Child Welfare League of America, The Brett Favre Fourward Foundation, and Ashton Kutcher's RockWorks Foundation. Many of Bass's family members in Mississippi were directly affected by the hurricane. That same year, Bass appeared on an episode of \"\" with a donation to a Russian woman to save a camp for disabled children in Russia.\n\nBass is a member of the Environmental Media Association's board of directors. He has also been involved with Animal Avengers, Shannon Elizabeth's animal rescue organization. He has two dogs which he adopted from a rescue shelter, both of whom he posed with in a PETA ad urging people to adopt rather than buy animals. In August 2007, Bass wrote a guest commentary for LOGO's \"Visible Vote '08\" blog, in which he expressed support for gay marriage. In September 2007, Bass participated in a series of GLAAD television advertisements promoting tolerance for the LGBT community. Bass has also been involved in fundraising for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.\n\n\nOfficial\n\nBiographical or discographical\n"}

His wife Lucy first appears in Christopher Bond's play. She is the faithful and loving wife of Benjamin Barker and mother of Johanna Barker, whose life is destroyed by the horrible Judge Turpin, who exiles her husband in order to have her all to himself. Soon afterward, Turpin rapes her, so she then poisons herself with arsenic. She does survive, but goes insane and disappears to live as a poor beggar, surviving on alms. Mistakenly believing her to be dead, Barker undertakes a long string of murders, with the ultimate goal of killing Turpin in order to avenge the destruction of his family.\n\nLucy Barker is the wife of Benjamin Barker, a barber in London's Fleet Street. They are happily married and have a new baby—Johanna Barker. Judge Turpin is immediately jealous of Benjamin because of Lucy's beauty and has Barker falsely arrested and exiled so that he may obtain her all for himself. Lucy ignores his pursuit, staying faithful to her husband, never once leaving home. Finally, she is lured to Turpin's estate, led to believe that the judge feels responsible for her plight and wants to help her.\n\nThis is not the case, however: Lucy arrives at Turpin's masquerade ball, where he drugs and rapes her. Lucy is so distraught that she attempts to kill herself with poison, but survives and is driven completely insane. She forgets everyone and everything she held dear and wanders the streets of London as a homeless beggar.\n\nWhen Benjamin Barker, under the alias of \"Sweeney Todd\", returns years later, Mrs. Lovett, who was in love with him, leads him to believe that Lucy is dead. Lucy shows evident distaste for Mrs. Lovett, calling her a witch and constantly hanging around her meat pie shop. Eventually, when Johanna is upstairs at the barber shop, Lucy pursues her up the stairs, believing Turpin's minion Beadle Bamford to be in Todd's shop. Todd then shows up and Lucy begins to recognize him. He, however, does not recognize her, cuts her throat and drops her body down the chute. Downstairs, after Todd has killed Judge Turpin, Lovett recognizes Lucy's body and scrambles to get rid of her.\n\nTodd enters and discovers that he had just killed his beloved wife, whereupon Lovett concedes that she lied to him because she was in love with him. Enraged, Todd throws Lovett in the oven to burn to death. Stricken with remorse, Todd holds Lucy's body and has his throat cut with his very own razor by Tobias Ragg, leaving them dead in each other's arms (in the film version, Todd willingly allows Tobias to cut his throat in revenge).\n\n\nIn the musical Lucy Barker sings only one song by herself and many others with other characters. The tracks were all composed by Stephen Sondheim. The tracks include:\n\n\n(* Edited for 2007 film)<br>\n"}
{"id": "84275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84275", "title": "Melissa Etheridge", "text": "Melissa Etheridge\n\nMelissa Lou Etheridge (born May 29, 1961) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and activist. Her self-titled debut album \"Melissa Etheridge\" was released in 1988 and became an underground success. The album peaked at No. 22 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and its lead single, \"Bring Me Some Water\", garnered Etheridge her first Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female. In 1993, Etheridge won her first Grammy award for her single \"Ain't It Heavy\" from her third album, \"Never Enough\". Later that year, she released what would become her mainstream breakthrough album, \"Yes I Am\". Its tracks \"I'm the Only One\" and \"Come to My Window\" both reached the top 30 in the United States, and the latter earned Etheridge her second Grammy award. \"Yes I Am\" peaked at No. 15 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and spent 138 weeks on the chart, earning a RIAA certification of 6x Platinum, her largest to date.\n\nIn October 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent surgery and chemotherapy. At the 2005 Grammy Awards, she made a return to the stage and, although bald from chemotherapy, performed a tribute to Janis Joplin with the song \"Piece of My Heart\". Etheridge's performance was widely lauded, with India.Arie writing \"I Am Not My Hair\" about Etheridge. Later that year, Etheridge released her first compilation album, \"\". The album was a success, peaking at No. 14 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and going Gold almost immediately. Her latest studio album is \"Memphis Rock and Soul\".\n\nEtheridge is known for her mixture of \"confessional lyrics, pop-based folk-rock, and raspy, smoky vocals.\" She has also been a gay and lesbian activist since her public coming out in January 1993. She has received fifteen Grammy Award nominations throughout her career, winning two, in 1993 and 1995. In 2007, she won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"I Need to Wake Up\" from the film \"An Inconvenient Truth\". In September 2011, Etheridge received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEtheridge was born in Leavenworth, Kansas, the younger of two girls of Elizabeth (Williamson), a computer consultant, and John Etheridge, an American Constitution teacher at Leavenworth High School. Her father was a high school psychology teacher, counselor and athletic director at her alma mater, Leavenworth High School. He died in August 1991. Her mother was a homemaker and a computer analyst and is now retired.\n\nEtheridge attended David Brewer School, which is still located at 17th and Osage Streets. She graduated in 1979 from Leavenworth High School (LHS) at 10th Avenue and Halderman. She was a member of the first \"Power and Life\" musical/dance group at LHS. Her childhood home was at 1902 Miami Street.\n\nEtheridge's interest in music began early; she picked up her first guitar at 8. She began to play in all-men country music groups throughout her teenage years, until she moved to Boston to attend Berklee College of Music.\n\nWhile at Berklee, Etheridge played the club circuit around Boston. After three semesters, Etheridge decided to drop out of Berklee and head to Los Angeles to attempt a career in music. Etheridge was discovered in a bar called Vermie's in Pasadena, CA. She had made some friends on a women's soccer team and those new friends came to see her play. One of the women was Karla Leopold, whose husband, Bill Leopold, was a manager in the music business. Karla convinced Bill to see her perform live. He was impressed, and has remained a pivotal part of Etheridge's career ever since. This, in addition to her gigs in lesbian bars around Los Angeles, led to her discovery by Island Records chief Chris Blackwell. She received a publishing deal to write songs for movies including the 1986 movie Weeds.\n\nIn 1985, prior to her signing, Etheridge sent her demo to Olivia Records, a lesbian record label, but was ultimately rejected. She saved the rejection letter, signed by \"the women of Olivia\", which was later featured in \"Intimate Portrait: Melissa Etheridge\", the Lifetime Television documentary of her life.\n\nAfter an unreleased first effort that was rejected by Island Records as being too polished and glossy, she completed her stripped-down self-titled debut in just four days. Her eponymous debut album \"Melissa Etheridge\", released in 1988, was an underground hit, and the single, \"Bring Me Some Water\", a hit on radio, was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nAt the time of the album's release, it was not generally known that Etheridge was a lesbian. While on the road promoting the album, she paused in Memphis, Tennessee, to be interviewed for the syndicated radio program \"Pulsebeat—Voice of the Heartland\", explaining the intensity of her music by saying: \"People think I'm really sad—or really angry. But my songs are written about the conflicts I have...I have no anger toward anyone else.\" She invited the radio syndication producer to attend her concert that night. He did and was surprised to find himself one of the few men in attendance.\n\nEtheridge followed up her first album's success by contributing background vocals to Don Henley's album \"The End of the Innocence\". She went into the studio and recorded her second album \"Brave and Crazy\" which was released in 1989.\n\n\"Brave and Crazy\" followed the same musical formula as her eponymous debut garnering a Grammy nomination. The album peaked at #22 on the \"Billboard\" charts (equal to her first album). Etheridge then went on the road, like one of her musical influences, Bruce Springsteen, and built a loyal fan base. Etheridge has covered his songs \"Thunder Road\" and \"Born to Run\" during live shows.\n\nIn 1992, Etheridge released her third album, \"Never Enough\". Similar to her prior two albums, \"Never Enough\" didn't reach the top of the charts peaking at #21 but gave Etheridge her first Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female for her single \"Ain't It Heavy\". \"Never Enough\" was considered a more personal and mature album from Etheridge at that time. With rumors circulating around her sexuality (Etheridge was not out yet at this point), the album seemed to inadvertently address these rumors.\n\nIn 1992, Etheridge established a performing arts scholarship at Leavenworth High School in honor of her father. She said her father used to \"spend his weekends driving me to Kansas City and all points around there so I could play in bands. I was underage so I couldn't have gone without him.\"\n\nOn September 21, 1993, after having come out publicly as a lesbian earlier in the year, Etheridge released \"Yes I Am\". The album would become her mainstream breakthrough album. Co-produced with Hugh Padgham, \"Yes I Am\" spent 138 weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200 charts and peaked at #15 and scored mainstream hits \"Come to My Window\" and her only \"Billboard\" Top 10 single \"I'm the Only One\", which also hit #1 on \"Billboard\"s Adult Contemporary chart. Sales-wise, \"Yes I Am\" earned a RIAA certification of 6× Platinum making it her biggest-selling album to date.\n\nEtheridge earned her second Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female for her single \"Come to My Window\", based on an unsettling scene in the classic box office smash Pavarotti film, \"Yes, Giorgio\". She also garnered two additional nominations in the Best Rock Song category for \"I'm the Only One\" and \"Come to My Window\", losing to Bruce Springsteen's \"Streets of Philadelphia\". \n\nIn 1993, Etheridge boycotted playing shows in Colorado over its passage of Amendment 2.\n\nIn a visit to Leavenworth in November 1994, she performed a benefit concert for a new park to be built near the high school. A ball field at the park will be named after her father. While she was here, she also donated money to help refurbish the Performing Arts Center in Leavenworth at 401 Delaware.\n\nIn 1994, Etheridge played a cover version of \"Burning Love\" live in Memphis, during the \"It's Now Or Never, The Tribute To Elvis\".\n\nAlso in 1994, she was honored by VH-1 for her work with the AIDS organization L.A. Shanti. During the televised occasion, she highlighted the appearance with a performance of \"I'm the Only One\" and a duet with Sammy Hagar covering The Rolling Stones' song, \"Honky Tonk Woman.\"\n\nThe album's fifth single, \"If I Wanted To\", debuted in February 1995 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at No. 25, the highest debut for a single in 1995.\n\nThe success of \"Yes I Am\" helped increase sales of Etheridge's earlier albums. In 1995, \"Melissa Etheridge\" earned a RIAA certification of 2× Platinum, while \"Never Enough\" earned a RIAA certification of Platinum.\n\nEtheridge's follow-up to \"Yes I Am\" was the moderately successful \"Your Little Secret\". The album was not as well received by critics as Etheridge's prior recordings. Featuring a lead single of the same name, \"Your Little Secret\" is the highest charting album of Etheridge's career, having reached #6 on the \"Billboard\" album charts; however, the album spent only 41 weeks on the chart. The album produced two Top 40 singles \"I Want to Come Over\" (\"Billboard\" #22, \"RPM\" #1) and \"Nowhere to Go\" (\"Billboard\" #40) and earned a RIAA certification of 2× Platinum, less than \"Yes I Am.\"\n\nIn 1996, Etheridge won an ASCAP Songwriter of the Year award. She also took a lengthy break from the music business to concentrate on her domestic arrangements. She also recorded \"Sin Tener A Donde Ir (Nowhere to Go)\" for the AIDS benefit album \"\" produced by the Red Hot Organization.\n\nShe appeared on Sesame Street, where she sang \"Like The Way U Do\", as she danced with a big red letter \"U\". \n\nIn 1997, she appeared as herself on the sitcom \"Ellen\" on \"The Puppy Episode\".\n\nEtheridge returned to the music charts with the release of \"Breakdown\" in October 1999. \"Breakdown\" peaked at #12 on the Billboard charts and spent 18 weeks in the charts. Despite this, \"Breakdown\" was the only album of Etheridge's career to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album (losing to Santana's \"Supernatural\"). In addition, her single \"Angels Would Fall\" was nominated in two categories: Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female (losing to Sheryl Crow) and Best Rock Song (losing to the Red Hot Chili Peppers) in 2000. A year later, another single from the album--\"Enough of Me\"—was nominated for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female (also losing to Sheryl Crow). The album earned a RIAA certification of Gold, but sold less copies than Etheridge's prior five albums.\n\nThe year 2001 saw the release of \"Skin\", an album she described as \"the closest I've ever come to recording a concept album. It has a beginning, middle and end. It's a journey.\" \"Skin\" garnered generally positive reviews with Metacritic scoring the album 73/100 from 9 reviews. Recorded after her breakup with partner Julie Cypher, \"Skin\" was described as \"[a] harrowing, clearly autobiographical dissection of a decaying relationship.\" Despite positive reviews, \"Skin\" sold less than 500,000 copies. On the Billboard charts, it peaked at #9 but dropped out of the Top 200 after just 12 weeks. The single \"I Want to Be in Love\" was nominated for the Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female (losing to Lucinda Williams). The video clip of this song starred Jennifer Aniston.\n\nIn 2002, Etheridge released an autobiography entitled \"The Truth Is: My Life in Love and Music.\"\n\nEtheridge began 2004 with the release of her eighth album \"Lucky\" on February 10. Etheridge was now in a new relationship with actress Tammy Lynn Michaels, whom she had begun dating in 2001. \"Lucky\" performed similarly to \"Skin\", selling fewer than 500,000 copies, peaking on the Billboard charts at #15 and spending 13 weeks on the charts. It also garnered a Grammy nomination for Etheridge's cover of the Greenwheel song \"Breathe\" for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo (losing to Bruce Springsteen).\n\nIn October 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer. At the 2005 Grammy Awards (the same ceremony for which \"Breathe\" was nominated), she made a return to the stage and, although bald from chemotherapy, performed a tribute to Janis Joplin with the song \"Piece of My Heart\". Etheridge's performance was lauded in song in India.Arie's \"I Am Not My Hair\".\n\nOn September 10, 2005, Etheridge participated in , a telethon in support for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. ReAct Now, part of an ongoing effort by MTV, VH1, CMT, seeks to raise funds for the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and America's Second Harvest. Etheridge introduced a new song specially written for the occasion called \"Four Days\". The a cappella song included themes and images that were on the news during the aftermath of the hurricane. Other charities she supports include The Dream Foundation and Love Our Children USA.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, Etheridge appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" to perform her song \"I Run for Life\".\n\nEtheridge wrote \"I Need to Wake Up\" for the film documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\", which won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 2006. The song was released only on the enhanced version of her greatest hits album, \"\".\n\nEtheridge was also a judge for the 5th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.\n\nIn August 2006, Melissa also produced and sang the vocal tracks on the Brother Bear 2 soundtrack, including collaborations with Josh Kelley.\n\nOn July 7, 2007, Etheridge performed at the Giants Stadium on the American leg of Live Earth. Etheridge performed the songs \"Imagine That\" and \"What Happens Tomorrow\" from \"The Awakening\", her tenth album, released on September 25, 2007, as well as the song \"I Need To Wake Up\" before introducing Al Gore. On December 11, 2007, she performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, together with a variety of artists, a concert which was broadcast live to over 100 countries. In addition, she performed at the U.S. 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 27, 2008.\n\nIn July 2009, Etheridge announced through her website that she and John Shanks would begin recording her 11th studio album the following summer. This was the first time since 1999 Etheridge and Shanks were the only ones involved in the production of a project.\nEtheridge was featured in UniGlobe Entertainment's breast cancer docudrama titled \"1 a Minute\" released in 2010. The documentary is being made by actress Namrata Singh Gujral and will also feature breast cancer survivors Olivia Newton-John, Diahann Carroll, Namrata Singh Gujral, Mumtaz and Jaclyn Smith as well as William Baldwin, Daniel Baldwin and Priya Dutt. The feature is narrated by Kelly McGillis. The film will also star Bárbara Mori, Lisa Ray, Deepak Chopra and Morgan Brittany.\n\nEtheridge also held a private listening party hosted at Michele Clark 's Sunset Sessions in 2010. She debuted her new album \"Fearless Love\" at the event held at the Rancho Bernardo Inn where she did a question and answer and played an acoustic set of her new singles in front of convention attendees and about 50 listeners of host station KPRI/San Diego.\n\nEtheridge performed her title track \"Fearless Love\" from her new album and \"Come to My Window\" from 1993 on the April 27, 2010, airing of \"Dancing With the Stars\" on ABC.\n\nEtheridge performed the role of St. Jimmy in Green Day's hit Broadway musical, American Idiot from February 1–6, 2011.\n\nEtheridge said in July 2011 that she is writing songs for a musical that her partner, Linda Wallem, is writing.\n\nEtheridge played her first Pride event on Saturday, June 9, 2012 at Pittsburgh Pride's – Pride in the Street.

The single was released on iTunes on January 28, 2014.\n\nIn 2014, she was one of the performers at the opening ceremonies of WorldPride in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, alongside Tom Robinson, Deborah Cox and Steve Grand.\n\nOn July 1, 2014 she released \"Take My Number\", the first single from her 13th studio album \"This Is M.E.\". The cover art for the album is a mosaic that includes pictures submitted by fans. Melissa explains the album cover on her official website: \"Because my fans are such a huge part of ME, and I wouldn't be ME without YOU, I took photos submitted by my fans and turned it into my album cover.\" The album was released on September 30, 2014.\n\nOn June 9, 2015 she released a live album titled: \"A Little Bit of Me: Live In L.A.\".

Etheridge supported Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign and since her coming out has been a gay rights activist. She is also an advocate for environmental issues and in 2006, she toured the US and Canada using biodiesel.\n\nEtheridge had a long-term partnership with Julie Cypher, and their relationship received coverage in \"The Advocate\", when an interview with editor Judy Wieder done in Amsterdam, \"The Great Dyke Hope,\" was released in July 1994. In it, Etheridge answered Wieder's questions about why the couple wanted to have children: \"I think one of the many fears people have about homosexuality is around children. I think that the more gay parents raise good, strong, compassionate people, the better the world will be.\" During this partnership, Cypher gave birth to two children, Bailey Jean, born February 10, 1997, and Beckett, born November 1998, fathered by sperm donor David Crosby. In 2000, Cypher began to reconsider her sexuality and on September 19, 2000, Etheridge and Cypher announced they were separating. In 2001, Etheridge documented her breakup with Cypher and other experiences in her memoir.\n\nIn 2002, Etheridge began dating actress Tammy Lynn Michaels.

On April 15, 2010 Etheridge and Michaels announced they had separated. In May 2012 it was announced that their two-year child support battle had been settled.\n\nIn October 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent chemotherapy. In October 2005, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Etheridge appeared on \"Dateline NBC\" with Michaels to discuss her struggle with cancer. By the time of the interview, Etheridge's hair had grown back after being lost during chemotherapy. She said that her partner had been very supportive during her illness. Etheridge also discussed using medicinal marijuana while she was receiving the chemotherapy. She said that the drug improved her mood and increased her appetite.

Marijuana is legal in the state of California.\n\nEtheridge supported Barack Obama's decision to have Pastor Rick Warren speak at his 2009 Presidential inauguration, believing that he can sponsor dialogue to bridge the gap between gay and straight Christians. She stated in her column at \"The Huffington Post\" that \"Sure, there are plenty of hateful people who will always hold on to their bigotry like a child to a blanket. But there are also good people out there, Christian and otherwise, that are beginning to listen.\"\n\nIn 2013, Etheridge called Angelina Jolie's choice to have a double mastectomy to avoid breast cancer a \"fearful\" and not \"brave\" choice. Etheridge told the \"Washington Blade\" in an interview that \"my belief is that cancer comes from inside you and so much of it has to do with the environment of your body...It's the stress that will turn that gene on or not...I really encourage people to go a lot longer and further before coming to that conclusion.\" According to Andrea Geduld, the director of the Breast Health Resource Center at Mt. Sinai Hospital, she told KMBZ.com that Etheridge's comments were out of line and that she finds Etheridge's criticism of Jolie puzzling, given that Jolie's choice to have a double mastectomy couldn't have been an easy one, \"we wouldn't criticize someone for wearing a seatbelt to reduce the risk of dying in an accident, so I'm not sure why we would criticize someone for having a mastectomy when we know it cuts their risk of getting cancer.\" Experts also caution that some of Etheridge's statements are not accurate.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with CNN after the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in \"United States v. Windsor\" and \"Hollingsworth v. Perry\", Etheridge stated that she planned to marry her partner Linda Wallem. The couple married on May 31, 2014 in San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California, two days after they both turned 53.\n\nEtheridge was featured on a 2015 episode of \"Who Do You Think You Are?\"\n\nStarting in 2014, Etheridge partnered with a California medical marijuana dispensary to make cannabis-infused wine. Etheridge and Greenway Compassionate Relief in Santa Cruz started small, making a few barrels of reds infused with CBDTHC's medical non-high inducing counterpartthat sold quickly. \"The vineyards were afraid the white wines would turn green and that no one would want to drink a green wine,\" Etheridge said.

{"id": "53662859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53662859", "title": "Miki Hanada", "text": "Miki Hanada\n\n\"In this Japanese name, the family name is Hanada.\"\n\nHanada Miki (花田　ミキ, 9 September 1914 – 1 August 2006) is a Japanese researcher of health nursing and health advisor.\n\nShe devoted herself to saving lives and health of people in Aomori Prefecture after the WWII, making efforts in building the educational institute for nurses, resolving towns and villages without health nurses from the standpoint of health administration, and establishing the system of rescue and nursing in remote areas. Her attitude has been handed down to a number of people who engage in nursing in Aomori even in Heisei period. Having worked as a military nurse during the war, she is known as a person who kept on telling her experiences during the war through self-published books　because of an unwavering belief that \"everything that stands against life is evil\".\n\nAfter graduating from Aomori Hirosaki Girls' High School (later Aomori Prefectural Hirosaki Chuo High School), she had to give up the further study because of the financial difficulty of her family and decided to be independent as a nurse. After gaining her career in Japanese Red Cross Society (JRCS) and Morioka Nursing School, she started to work for Aomori Branch of JRCS in 1934. She was called up as a military nurse after the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, thus she spent almost all her youth in the battlefields.\n\nIn 1942, she suffered from tuberculosis and typhoid fever on the hospital ships then went into the Hiroshima Military Hospital (later Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital). Although she had not chosen to be a nurse due to humanitarianism, she was impressed with devoted nursing by a nurse while hospitalized there, which greatly changed her thought of health nursing.\n\nShe returned to the military after recovering from the typhoid fever. Gradually she agonized herself with the death of many soldiers and the reality that soldiers who recovered from wounds in the hospital go to their death again, she harbored her resentment against war itself finally concluding that \"everything that stands against life is evil\". At least by way of resisting the war, she continued to send the wills of soldiers dying in bed to their families without being noticed by the inspectors.\n\nThe following year, 1943, she returned home because her tuberculosis was not cured. After studying hard, she got the certifications of a teacher of nursing and of a health nurse. She became the head nurse of the nursing school in Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital which opened in the same year in Hachinohe and started to live in the residential hall together with her students.\n\nIn 1947, when the Association of Japanese Midwives, Nurses and Health Nurses (later Japanese Nursing Association) was established as one of the reforms of nursing by GHQ, she undertook the foundation of its branch in Aomori. Although she suffered from opposition by people who still had their old thoughts before WWII, Grace Elizabeth Alt (1905–1978), who was in Japan as a head nurse of the department of public health in GHQ, gave her a tremendous boost in it. Within the year, their hard work reached fruition and The Association of Japanese Midwives, Nurses, and Health Nurses in Aomori (later Aomori Prefectural Association of Nursing.) was established The following words from Alt to Hanada greatly encouraged her while struggling with the hardship because of postwar shortage in hospitals and in the education of nurses. In 1949, the outbreak of polio occurred in Hachinohe. The vaccine had not been developed in those days, and newspapers reported that phenomenon was a rare case in the world. Hanada, receiving the request from the doctor who was in charge of it, went to Tokyo for studying the treatment. She got the information materials of Kenny Method which was effective in Australia from GHQ with the help for JRCS. Curing people in Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital every day, she introduced the method to the public through newspaper articles. \n\nIn the reform of nursing at the postwar time, Hanada continued to studying American style nursing to find that education of nurses in Japan is far behind America. In order to have the society recognize nurses as a profession, she tried to establish an educational institute of nursing, following the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery in London. Her desire was achieved by opening the Aomori-ken Koto Kango Gakuin (later Aomori University of Health and Welfare). However, there was only one applicant at first, which proved that Hanada's thought had hardly been accepted to the public yet. A newspaper article titled \"Hated Prefectural College of Nursing\" denounced her building an unnecessary, nonurgent school. She visited high schools around Aomori in order to attract students by introducing Florence Nightingale with her handmade picture-story shows and to explain the importance of nursing education. Thanks to her efforts, the school had 38 applicants the following year. Hanada also worked there as a teacher.\n\nAccompanying the establishment of this prefectural institute, the Nursing Unite of Medical Department was founded in Aomori Prefectural Government. Hanada was asked to be the unit chief because she was the very person who proposed to establish the educational institute. In 1950, a year before the College of Nursing opened, she quit the Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital and started to work in the Government. This post was the top hierarchy in the educational system of nursing in Aomori. The fact that a woman from outside of the Prefectural Government got the position of a unit chief for the first time attracted tremendous interest amongst mass media at that time, not only because women in those days rarely had a position title but also because even male officers with more than 10 years' experiences had difficulty in getting the position like hers.\n\nIn 1955, Hanada visited Iwate Prefecture to study the health action by Iwate National Health Insurance Organization regarding Society-Managed Health Insurance had been active for a long time outstandingly in Tohoku Area. After returning, she cooperated with the same organization in Aomori to contribute to spreading their actions. While working on it, she discussed the health problems with the residents to realize the need to send health nurses around Aomori, following the examples like Kochi where the problems had successfully been resolved.\n\nIn 1964, in order to resolve the infant mortality rate of Aomori that was the highest in Japan those days, Hanada started a campaign called \"Mottara Korosuna Undo (the Never Kill If You Get Pregnant Campaign)\" together with health nurses and midwives. She gave mothers bleached cotton to support their wombs if they notify their pregnancy to the Prefectural Government early for the purpose of raising awareness of not having fetuses die. This community-based campaign enabled health nurses to build relationships while visiting households steadily and honestly.\n\nIn those days, approximately half of all the towns or villages in Aomori, especially remote areas, had no health nurse because of difficult financial situations of such communities and lack of health nurses who hoped to work there. In order to resolve this problem, Haken Hoken-fu Seido (The Temporary Health Nurse System) devised by Hanada began in 1965. This system allowed graduates from Prefectural College of Nursing to be employed as officials of Aomori Prefecture and sent to each town or village with traveling expenses paid by the government. This system increased the number of health nurses who accepted to work for remote areas as their period of toleration for some years before going back to cities. Moreover, some of them married and settled in their places of appointment to keep working there. Although 29 towns and villages had no health nurse in 1962, the establishment of the system of sending at least 2 of them in these areas in 1971 allowed all areas in Aomori Prefecture to have health nurses. It is said that the maintenance of this system of health nursing was impossible without the leadership of both Hanada and Takeuchi Shunkichi, who was the local governor in those days and had similar experiences to Hanada as a war correspondent.\n\nHanada retired the Aomori Prefectural Government in 1973. Her position as the Health Nursing Supervisor at retirement was the highest of all female governors those days. She won the Public Health Award held by Dai-ichi Life Group in the same year, and To-o Award by To-o Daily Press in the following year.\n\nAfter retiring the local government, Hanada worked as a freelance researcher of health nursing. In 1950, she got the position of the head of Aogiri-kai in Japan Red Cross in Aomori (hereafter Aogiri-kai), a mutual support organization composed of unmarried women who studied nursing in JRCS, where she made her active base. She actively accepted many requests of lectures and interviews.\n\nIn order to counter the threat from aging society, Hanada started Kango Ginko (Nursing Bank) organized by Aogiri-kai in 1980. The system was to have elderly people help work each other through the special tickets instead of money, where Hanada announced herself as the president. Although it was a pioneering system, it did not take its root in the society. In the following year, Aogiri-kai, the Association of Social Workers in Health Services of Aomori, and the Federation of Regional Women's Organization in Aomori cooperated starting telephone counseling services for senior citizens called \"Koreisha 110 ban (number 110 for senior citizens)\". This system developed later, resulting in organizing \"Volunteer Ajisai\", where the three organizations and the branch office of Japanese Nursing Association collaborate with each other. Hanada also worked as its caretaker.\n\nIn 1994, Hanada was nominated for Florence Nightingale Medal. Even though this is the most prestigious award in the world as a nurse, she rejected to receive it. She told the reason in the bulletin of Aogiri-kai titled \"Aogiri-kai Dayori\" as a previous military nurse and a person who experienced the WWII as below;Within the same year, she self-published the collection of her war stories as a military nurse, \"Kataritsugitai\" (I Want To Hand This Down). Also in 1997, she published the Tanka collection titled \"Oki Nao Kiezu\" (Fire Has Not Yet Disappeared), hoping to tell many people her experiences of the war. It was hard to transmit experiences of the war as memories of it was gradually fading after half a century of the postwar period. Despite that, she continued to self-publishing her war stories and sent them to her friends.\n\nIn 1998, Hanada resigned the head of Aogiri-kai on account of old age. She stayed away from people who were in close relationships before, only keeping in touch with them by exchanging letters. It is said this was because she did not like to show old and weak herself to people.\n\nIn 2006, Hanada died for the liver cancer at the age of 91. She was unmarried throughout her life because she lost the chance because of the war. Based on her will, her body was given to the Faculty of Medicine in Hirosaki University and the funeral was not held. Her last words as a pacifist, which was sent to her younger brother, was published in her obituary in To-o Daily Press and impressed the readers.\n\nHanada and Satoe Kamimura, who led health nursing in Kochi Prefecture in Showa era, were called \"Miki Hanada in Aomori for the East, Satoe Kamimura in Kochi for the West\". They were also called \"Emperor Kamimura for the West, Emperor Hanada for the East\" by people who engaged in nursing in those days because of their leadership and humanity. Compared with Kamimura, Hanada is remarkable in that she seriously regarded the action by local residents and labor movement by health nurses. This is because of their different career experiences; when Kamimura started to work as a health nurse, the purpose of the work had already been unified for cooperation in the all-out war, while Hanada had been an expert in nursing activities before the unique health nursing system in Aomori Prefecture started.\n\nOn the other hand, since she regarded the residents and labors seriously, she often clashed not only with the administration when working for the hospital but also with the top management and the government when working for Aomori Prefectural Government. When she tried to improve the working condition of nurses in the hospital, the doctors taunted her to be so Americanized. When the innovative councilors criticized the way of governing health nursing in Aomori prefectural assembly, the false rumor that Hanada stirred them to do it flew. Hanada herself was severely told off by her boss even though she knew nothing. She also clashed with her boss when tackling on the health nursing in remote areas, which made her write resignation letters several times. It is said that she endured these hardships remembering the encouragement across the border by Grace Elizabeth Alt in GHQ.\n\nThe previous nurses in Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital describe Hanada as a person who always thought of nurses as their head in the prewar era when the social position of women was low and working women were received prejudice; One of Hanada's students in Aomori-ken Koto Kango Gakuin, who later worked as a professor in Aomori University of Health and Welfare, Faculty of Health Science, Department of Nursing, told the feature of her lectures like below;The Chief of public health department of Aomori Prefectural Government in those days called her \"giant\", evaluating her activities there like below;\"Mottara Korosuna Undo\" promoted by her in Aomori Prefectural Government was worth Nobel Prize in that the campaign remarkably contributed to the reduction of infant death rates by improving the local nursing services. However, there were contrary opinions that the word \"Korosuna (Never kill)\" was too direct and shocking for a slogan. Additionally, some criticized distributing bleached cotton as bribing women with stuff they want, others insisted that Aomori Prefecture was regarded as the representative of backward prefecture because the bleached cotton was thought to be out of date.\n\nThe system to send health nurses formulated by Hanada in the following year called \"Aomori Method\" was paid a special attention to and highly evaluated all over Japan. After this system was established, no town or village suffered from the tough situation without health medical services. Despite that, the system was hard to be accepted by the personnel department and the general affairs department in the prefectural government because it had to employ health nurses, who each town and village normally should have employed by themselves.\n\nThe \"Nurse Bank\", which she formulated as the resolution of aging society after retiring the prefectural government, was paid much attention to by mass media since the system was pioneering. However, the reason for its unsuccess is indicated as following; that it was not the right time; that the leader had already retired the official; and that she lacked people who could always assist her. Despite that, both the Association of Social Workers in Health Services of Aomori and the Federation of Regional Women's Organization in Aomori were interested in the \"Nurse Bank\" as a supportive system for aged people, joining \"Koreisha 110 ban\" which had the same purpose.\n\n\"Koreisha 110 ban\" was reputed to make multiplier effects on account of cooperation of three different types of associations and organizations. Some customers those says made full use of the counseling service, talking for 40 minutes. It was rare in those days for several different parties to cooperate with each other but Hanada bridged them with her caring personality, according to the vice president of the Association of Social workers in Health Services of Aomori at the time. The Social Welfare Council in Aomori has the similar service \"Fukushi Anshin Denwa (Welfare and Security Hot Line)\", whose predecessor is \"Koreisha 110 ban\" run by Hanada.\n\n"}

An agent of Z Special Unit was to be landed on the north coast of Java to recruit more men who would give active assistance to the allied cause.\nThe operation was conceived in January 1944 but owing to the shortage of available submarines and the priority of Operation Hornbill it was delayed. When Hornbill was aborted arrangements were made for the mission to commence in February 1945.\n\nThe agent chosen was Q272298 Private John Charles Buxton of “Z” Special Unit. Buxton was born in Semarang to an English father and Javanese mother and escaped to Australia from Japanese occupied Java in 1943 aboard a lugger. As he was familiar with the area, Buxton would probably have more success than Operation Tiger, which was a series of operations conducted by the Netherlands East Indies Forces Intelligence Service (NEIFIS), almost all ended in disaster.\nThe insertion into Japanese occupied Java was to be carried out on 24 February 1945 along the coast near Ujung Piring (Cape Piring) not far from the town of Jepara and approximately 80km north east of Semarang. HMS Telemachus arrived at the location but owing to bad weather after 3 days Lt Cdr W D A King RN abandoned the landing and proceeded with the patrol before returning to Fremantle via Darwin where Buxton was disembarked on 30 March 1945.\n\nOn 12 May 1945 Buxton left Fremantle aboard USS Blueback (Lt Cdr M K Clementson USN). He was successfully inserted at Cape Piring on 19 May 1945 and after obtaining identity documents made his way to Semarang.

Wilmshurst reported these findings to Sterling-Winthrop, who asked him to suppress the data. He refused, and they retaliated by threatening litigation. He continued the research and published his adverse findings in abstracts and conference presentations, until Sterling-Winthrop staff removed all stocks of the drug from the hospital pharmacy. A review by the Netherlands Committee for the Evaluation of Medicine found substantial discrepancies between the record cards of Wilmshurst's group and those submitted by Sterling-Winthrop. Wilmshurst showed that they had falsified the records, suppressing the adverse events he had reported. He then contacted the UK's Committee for the Safety of Medicines and discovered that Sterling-Winthrop had also failed to report the adverse events to the UK; they had also threatened the UK Government with closure of a large manufacturing plant in the UK. Sterling-Winthrop subsequently reported over 1,400 adverse events to the US Federal Food and Drug Administration, and terminated research and marketing in the US, while continuing to market the drug in the developing world. Finally, after a substantial \"Guardian\" feature, they withdrew the oral drug entirely in 1986. In 2003 he was given the Health Watch Award for this work.\n\nIn 2000, Wilmshurst published a paper linking migraine to patent foramen ovale, a common cardiac condition affecting up to one in four people. This led NMT Medical to develop a PFO closure device branded STARflex. Wilmshurst was recruited as part of the \"Migraine Intervention with STARflex Technology\" (MIST) trial. The number of patients and potential value of the market (estimated in excess of $15bn) drove NMT's stock price to $25/share. A substantial discrepancy emerged between echocardiogram result interpretations of the implanting cardiologists and Wilmshurst's review. Wilmshurst reported a significantly higher proportion (one in three versus four in sixty-five) with residual cardiac shunts. An independent review backed Wilmshurst's figures. Less than a fortnight after returning from a conference in Washington where he discussed his results, Wilmshurst was contacted by lawyers for NMT making accusations of \"seriously defamatory allegations\". The first NMT libel suit was lodged in 2007, and drew media attention. NMT served four separate writs on Wilmshurst. The courts demanded that they lodge £200,000 due to their parlous financial state and the likelihood of failing in the action. NMT declared bankruptcy after pursuing Wilmshurst for over three years.\n\nIn light of the Hadiza Bawa-Garba case, Dr Peter Wilmhurst has both referred himself to the GMC, as well as asking the regulatory body to both remove himself from the register, and scrutinise his medical practice. This is due to the ongoing concern felt by medical practitioners in England with the GMC's outcome and appeal (successfully won) against Bawa-Garba. Multiple parties have been concerned about the outcome of this hearing, as well as the repercussions on current medical practice.\n\nWilmshurst's experience, along with British Chiropractic Association v Singh, have been cited as catalysts for the UK's libel reform campaign, leading to the Defamation Act 2013.\n"}

{"id": "1053913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1053913", "title": "Samuel Parris", "text": "Samuel Parris\n\nSamuel Parris (1653February 27, 1720) was the Puritan minister in Salem, Massachusetts during the Salem witch trials. He was also the father of one of the afflicted girls, and the uncle of another.\n\nSamuel Parris, son of Thomas Parris, was born in London, England to a family of modest financial success and religious nonconformity. Samuel immigrated to Boston in the early 1660s, where he attended Harvard College at his father's behest. When his father died in 1673, Samuel left Harvard to take up his inheritance in Barbados, where he maintained a sugar plantation.\n\nIn 1680, after a hurricane hit Barbados, damaging much of his property, Parris sold a little of his land and returned to Boston, where he brought his slave Tituba and married Elizabeth Eldridge. Eldridge was noted by many as being incredibly beautiful, and was said to be one of the most beautiful women in Salem Village. Together they had three children, Thomas Parris, Elizabeth Parris, and Susannah Parris. Although the plantation supported his merchant ventures, Parris was dissatisfied with his lack of financial security and began to look to the ministry. In July 1689, he became minister of Salem Village (now Danvers), Massachusetts.\n\nSalem Village was a contentious place to live and was known to be quarrelsome by neighbouring towns and villages. Its dispersed settlement pattern may have resulted in a lack of a sense of common purpose that may have united more orderly and arranged communities. Parris was the fourth minister appointed in a series of unsuccessful attempts to keep a permanent minister. James Bayley (1673–79) and George Burroughs (1680–83) each stayed only a few years, departing after the congregation failed to pay their full rates. Deodat Lawson (1684–88) left with less contention. Further tension was caused by Parris' delay in accepting the position and his inability to resolve his parishioners' disputes. There were also disputes over Parris' compensation. In October 1691, the town decided to stop paying his wages. The issue was further antagonized by Parris' perceived arrogance when he purchased gold candlesticks for the meetinghouse and new vessels for the sacraments. These issues, and others that were more personal between the villagers, continued to grow unabated.\n\nThe events which led to the Salem witch trials began when Parris' daughter, Betty, and her cousin, Abigail Williams, accused Parris' slave Tituba of witchcraft. Parris beat Tituba until she confessed herself a witch, and John Indian, her husband, began accusing others. The delusion spread, many were apprehended, most of whom were imprisoned. During the 16-month duration of the Salem witch trials phenomenon, 19 persons were hanged, and one, Giles Corey, was pressed to death.\n\nDuring a 1692 sermon, Parris declared that \"as in our text [John 6:10] there was one [devil] among the 12 [disciples]… so in our churches God knows how many Devils there are,\" encouraging antagonistic villagers to locate and destroy \"witches\" who, as it happened, were frequently individuals with whom Parris and his key allies, the Putnam family, had taken umbrage.\n\nAs Parris had been an active prosecutor in the witchcraft cases, in 1693, his parish brought charges against Parris for his part in the trials. Parris apologized in his essay \"Meditations for Peace\", which he presented in November 1694. Increase Mather led a church council which then vindicated him.\n\nParris was then involved in a dispute with his congregation over parsonage land he had seized to compensate himself for salary he was owed. The dispute found its way to an Ipswich court, which, in 1697, ordered his salary to be paid and the land to be returned. By 1696, however, he had found his situation untenable. He resigned that year and left Salem. Records in the \"Suffolk Deeds\" indicate it likely he returned to business in Boston in 1697.\n\nHis wife Elizabeth died in 1696. In 1699, he remarried, to Dorothy Noyes, in Sudbury. He preached two or three years at Stow. He then moved to Concord (1704/05). He also preached six months in Dunstable in 1711. He died on February 27, 1720, in Sudbury.\n\nParris features in Arthur Miller's play \"The Crucible,\" set against the backdrop of the witch trials. In the play, his daughter Elizabeth Parris is the first to become ill because of supposed and she is accused of witchcraft. In the 1957 and 1996 film adaptations of Miller's play, he was portrayed by Jean Debucourt and Bruce Davison, respectively.\n\nParris is also a character in \"Tituba of Salem Village\" by Ann Petry, another work of fiction relating to the witch trials.\n\nIn the novel \"Supernatural: One Year Gone\", Parris is portrayed as having been manipulated by the real witches into starting the trials and also manipulated the girls to accuse his enemies and rivals to get rid of them. At the end of the novel, after the truth is revealed, he swears to put an end to the innocent women.\n\n\nAttribution\n\n"}

He was the older brother of Piano Red. Their nicknames were derived from both men being albinos. The brothers were separated by almost a generation and never recorded together. Speckled Red and Piano Red both played in a raucous goodtime barrelhouse boogie-woogie style, although Speckled Red played slow blues more often. Both recorded versions of \"The Right String (But the Wrong Yo-Yo)\", Speckled Red in 1930 and Piano Red, who had a hit with the song 20 years later.\n\nPrior to his birth the family had moved for brief periods to Detroit, Michigan, and then Atlanta, Georgia, after his father violated Jim Crow laws, before settling in Hampton, Georgia. The family, consisting of Perryman and seven brothers and sisters, had little musical background. Speckled Red was a self-taught piano player, influenced primarily by his idol Fishtail and by Charlie Spand, James Hemingway and William Ezell and initially inspired by Paul Seminole in a movie theatre. He also learned to play the organ at his church.\n\nBy his mid-teens he was playing house parties and juke joints. He moved back to Detroit in his mid-20s to play anywhere he could, including nightclubs and brothels, and was noticed by a Brunswick Records talent scout just before he left for Memphis, Tennessee, where he was located by Jim Jackson. It was here that he had his first recording sessions, resulting in two classics for Brunswick, \"Wilkins Street Stomp\" and the hit \"The Dirty Dozens\". Although the lyrics were sung rather than spoken, with its elaborate wordplay and earthy subject matter, \"The Dirty Dozens\" is considered in some respects a precursor of rap music.\n\n\"I want all you women to fall in line<br>\n\"And shake yo shimmy like i'm shakin' mine<br>\n\"You shake yo shimmy and you shake it fast<br>\n\"If you can't shake the shimmy, shake yo' yas yas yas\"<br>\n<br>\n\"You a dirty mistreater, a robber and a cheater<br>\n\"Stick you in a dozens and yo pappy is yo cousin<br>\n\"And yo mama do the lawdylawd\"\n\nThe following year, 1930, he recorded again, this time in Chicago, Illinois, resulting in most notably \"The Dirty Dozens No. 2,\" which was not nearly as successful and the pianist was without a contract or label and again playing making the rounds at Memphis venues and in St. Louis bars. His 1938 session work in Aurora, Illinois, with the slide guitar player Robert Nighthawk and the mandolinist Willie Hatcher for Bluebird Records, was steady and long but also unsuccessful, and sometime in the 1940s he moved back to St. Louis and continued his career of playing in taverns. He also worked as a laborer in a public produce market until servicemen returned home to heavy lifting jobs.\n\nCharlie O'Brien, a St. Louis policeman and something of a blues aficionado who applied many of his professional investigative methods to track down old bluesmen during the 1950s, \"rediscovered\" Speckled Red on December 14, 1954, who subsequently was signed to Delmark Records as the label's first blues artist. He experienced a small revival of interest in his music during the late 1950s and 1960s, his abilities still considerable, and worked around the St. Louis-area jazz scene, regularly as the intermission pianist for the Dixie Stompers, performing concerts with Dixie Mantinee and the St. Louis Jazz Club, played the Goldenrod Showboat, and played the University of Chicago Folk Festival in 1961, went to Dayton, Ohio, with Gene Mayl's Dixieland Rhythm Kings, and toured Europe in 1959 with Chris Barber. Several recordings were made in 1956 and 1957 for the Tone, Delmark, Folkways, and Storyville record labels.\n\nHis age, however, had become a factor, and the remainder of the 1960s saw scattered performances. He died of cancer on January 2, 1973, in St. Louis, at the age of 80.\n\n\n"}

The historian Nikephoros Gregoras erroneously calls her \"Maria\" in one passage. In January 1346, to cement her father's alliance with the rising Ottoman emirate and to prevent the Ottomans from giving their aid to the Empress-regent Anna of Savoy during the ongoing civil war, she was betrothed to the Ottoman ruler, Orhan Gazi. The marriage took place in the summer of the same year. Her parents and sisters escorted her to Selymbria, where Orhan's representatives, including grandees of his court and a cavalry regiment, arrived on a fleet of 30 ships. A ceremony was held at Selymbria, where Orhan's envoys received her and escorted her to the Ottoman lands in Bithynia, across the Marmara Sea, where the actual wedding took place.\n\nTheodora remained a Christian after her marriage, and was active in supporting the Christians living under Ottoman rule. In 1347 she gave birth to her only son, Şehzade Halil, who was captured by Genoese pirates for ransom while still only a child. The Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos was instrumental in his eventual release. Later, Halil married Irene, a daughter of John V Palaiologos and Theodora's sister, Helena Kantakouzene.\n\nExcept for a three-day sojourn in Constantinople in February 1347, in the aftermath of her father's victory in the civil war, Theodora remained at the Ottoman court until Orhan's death in 1362. After that, she apparently returned to Constantinople, where she lived with her sister, the Empress Helena, in the palace. She is last known to have been held imprisoned at Galata during the brief reign of Andronikos IV Palaiologos there in 1379–81.\n\nA fictionalised form of her character is the subject of Bertrice Small's novel \"Adora\", published 1980.\n\n"}

During his life, he fought against social discrimination, racism and homophobia.\n\nFrom the 2000s until his death, he was a controversial figure in the eyes of the public and fought against opponents of homosexuality and homosexual psychopath theorists. Throughout his school years, he had been pushed away from a similar peer group. In December 2002, he planned to leave school in order to attend Seil High School. From 1999 to 2003, he was active in the anti-LGBT discrimination movement, the LGBT rights movement, and homophobia opposition movement. In 2001, he debuted in literary world, involving himself in poetry, writing and columnist activities also, but mainly poetry. He received much discrimination and was the victim of prejudice, because of his sexual identity. In 2002, he joined the Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea, and was also a peace activist and a conscientious objector to military service. Up until his death, he wrote more poetry and prose, but his work was rejected, as he was gay.\n\nAfter 2000 he was involved in a LGBT human rights, anti-discrimination, disability rights, and an anti-war peace movement.\n\nOn April 26, 2003, Yun drank two Korean distilled spirits and hanged himself, as a result of the homophobia and closed-mindedness in South Korea. Because of his death, obscene words against homosexual and transgender individuals were revoked and protection was somewhat implemented through the South Korean Youth Protection Act (청소년 보호법). He wrote under the pen name Yook Woo Dang (육우당, 六友堂, \"home of six friends\") and Seolheon (설헌, 雪軒) and was also known by his nickname Midong (미동, 美童, beautiful boy) or Donghwa(동화, 童花, Boy flower). His Catholic baptismal name was \"Antonio\".\n\nHyon-seok was born in 1984, at Bupyong, Incheon. He was born into a devoted Roman Catholic family, and was baptised with the name \"Antonio\". His family were school teachers. He was bullied throughout his school years, and eventually dropped out of Incheon High School in 2002. As a result of this bullying, he often took tranquillisers, and sleeping pills. In 1999, Yun was part of discussions and disputes on the Internet forums, and endured a great deal of homophobia until his death. Yun created an Interpia 98 homepage, but his website was visited by an internet terrorist, and due to personal attacks in 2002, he closed his homepage.\n\nHe awoke to his sexual identity during his time in middle school. He was recognized for his sexual identity problems, and as a result of this, he was picked on. Later he was excluded by his peer group and his neighbourhood due to discrimination. On October 8, 2002, he was sent to a psychiatric clinic by his family, despite his emphatic claims that he was not a psychopath. He was dependent on green tea (녹차), rosary, tobacco, alcohol, foundation and hypnotics, which became known metaphorically as his \"six friends\" as Korean writer Kwak Byong-chan was based on his one nickname \"Yook Woo-dang\", which also means \"six friends\" in the Hangul language. In his last years of life, it was Yun's favorite phrase for the majority of his activity and content, and was used as a signature.\n\nHis family disapproved of his homosexuality and pressured him to be heterosexual, but Yun said, \"I can't be heterosexual and don't want to be heterosexual.\" He was thoroughly isolated, about which he would complain in his diary. In October 2002, one diary entry from Yun said, \"I do not think I'm abnormal. In this world born and living right-handed, also naturally left-handed is born and living. This road exists as also another road exists. Most persons use the well-worn path, but I have to go on a lone desolate path.\" He enjoyed reading, \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" and \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\".\n\nDuring his adolescence, he tried to drown his pain in writing and also went to volunteer in orphanages and disabled groups. Some famous quotes from his works include the following:\n\nAnother famous poem by Yun, \"Reborn\", reads:\n\nYun hinted of the censorship present in South Korean society through his many works and stories. He often embedded satire within his poems, prose, novels and social criticism, yet still sang softly about love.\n\nAfter completing elementary school, Yun wrote poetry and prose, but the majority of his work was given the notoriety to not be seen or read, due to his sexual identity. In his writings, he openly confessed his disappointment in prejudices and conventions, superstition and the remnants of blind faith, and the tradition of clinging to old customs, which strongly dominated the lives of many in South Korea.\n\nHe harbored ill feelings towards South Korean political leaders due to the institutionalized homophobia rampant in South Korea, and because the majority of South Korean political figures were opposed to homosexuality, feeling that it violated traditional social norms and values.\n\nHe was deeply upset by the assertion by political figures that his work violated traditional Korean social mores, due to the conservative attitudes prevalent in South Korean society.\n\nFrom March 1, 2000, he attended Seil High-school in Bupyeong-gu. However, in December 2002, he dropped out of high school. After leaving school, he moved to the Dongdaemun District in Seoul and became involved in the literary and LGBT activist scene. Due to the widespread criticism of the homosexual themes in his writings, especially by fundamental Christians, he was unable to write under his real name despite wanting to do so. Instead he used the pseudonym Yook Woo Dang, a reference to the six objects he relied on most - green tea, cosmetic foundation, alcohol, tobacco, rosary beads and sleeping pills.\n\nAfter the year 2000, Yun objected to the theory that HIV and related infections are directly transmitted by homosexuals, who were considered to be vectors for the virus. In his objection, he stated that the theory was a groundless assumption. Early on in the movement, he was a person who persuaded people that homophobia was unacceptable and fought against discriminatory objections to homosexuality on the internet. In January 2002, he became a long-distance activist. In January 2001, he joined the D Sijo(시조 詩調) poet club and W Sijo poet club, with a rank as a student member. He continued his activity and contributed many writings, including poetry, to Sijo for a period of two years. In February 2001, he joined and later worked for the organization Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea. He also became a conscientious objector to Korea's conscription military service. Yun emphasised that viewing homosexuality as sinful and denying acceptance for homosexuals as 'children of God' is wrong, whereas some Conservative Christian groups' ideology viewed it as anti-biblical activity.\n\nIn autumn of 2002, Yun sought after more volunteers or full-time employees for the Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea. His earnest desires were approved for March of the following year.\n\nIn January 2003, he was hired to work in a gay bar in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. However, due to anxiety, he soon retired from the job. Afterwards, parallel with several part-time jobs, he committed to become a civil and human rights activist. On March 24, 2003, he became a full-time employee of Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea. He participated in media censorship-opposition movements. Yun was repetitively insistent, particularly with some South Koreans who were intent on trampling many artists, entertainers and writers, even though pop culture was fresh with a variety of creativity and various artists. They were condemned in the name of morals and ethics.\n\nYun was an LGBT rights activist, and during this time participated in the abolition movement of LGBT and LGBT related media which was regarded as \"youth Harmful media specified\"(청소년 유해 매체).
