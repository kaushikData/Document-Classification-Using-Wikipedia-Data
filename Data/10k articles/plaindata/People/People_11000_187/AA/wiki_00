The most important holy sites of the religion are the Seven Shrines of Abkhazia, each one having its own priestly clan, where rituals and prayers began to be solemnly restored from the 1990s onwards.\n\nAccording to the 2003 census, 8% of the population of Abkhazia adheres to Abkhaz neopaganism. On 3 August 2012 the Council of Priests of Abkhazia was formally constituted in Sukhumi. The possibility of making the Abkhaz native religion one of the state religions was discussed in the following months.\n\nThe traditional Abkhaz religion was actually never completely wiped out; circles of priests, whose activity was kept secret, passed on traditional knowledge and rites in the times when Christianity and Islam became dominant in the region, and later in Soviet times of anti-religion.\n\nSince the 1980s, and later in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Abkhaz native religion was resurrected by the joint efforts of priests who began to resurface, rural people reactivating local rituals, and urban intellectuals supporting Paganism as an integral part for a reawakening of the Abkhaz ethnic and cultural identity.\n\nA turning point for the revival of the Abkhaz native religion came with the Georgian–Abkhazian conflict. With tensions growing, more and more Abkhazians began associating Orthodox Christianity with the Georgians, and chose to reject it, turning to the native gods. The eventual victory of Abkhazia in the 1992–93 war with Georgia catalyzed the Neopagan revival. Many Abkhaz believe that their national god Dydrypsh awarded them the victory.\n\nSince then the Abkhaz native religion has been protected by Abkhaz authorities. Government officials took part in a bull sacrifice in October 1993 celebrated to thank the Lord Dydrypsh for the victory over the Georgians, and since then they regularly take part in worship rituals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35044656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35044656", "title": "Anton Bacalbașa", "text": "Anton Bacalbașa\n\nAnton Costache Bacalbașa (, commonly known as Toni or Tony Bacalbașa, pen names Rigolo, Wunderkind, , Jus., Wus., Zig. etc.; February 21, 1865 – October 1, 1899) was a Romanian political journalist, humorist and politician, chiefly remembered for his antimilitaristic series \"Moș Teacă\". Together with his brothers Ioan and Constantin, he entered public life as a republican and socialist militant. For a while, his career was intertwined with that of Marxist doyen Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who inspired in him the idea of a socialist art addressed to the masses. He was himself a popularizer of Marxist ideas, and one of the first Marxist intellectuals in Romanian political history.\n\nAfter 1893, Bacalbașa was at the center of Marxist politics, as an executive of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR). While active within the socialist movement and making his essential contributions to Romanian comediography, Toni joined Ion Luca Caragiale, his close friend, in editing the satirical magazine \"Moftul Român\". He helped Constantin Mille to turn \"Adevărul\" daily into a socialist tribune, serving as its editor and directing its short-lived literary supplement (\"Adevărul Literar\"). His choice of subjects and his perceived harshness were the subject of several controversies, and, in 1894, he defended the \"Adevărul\" office building from rioting anti-socialist students. Over the following years, Bacalbașa drifted away from both \"Adevărul\" and the PSDMR, switching his allegiance to the political club formed around Nicolae Fleva.\n\nAt the time of his death, aged 34, Bacalbașa had served in the Assembly of Deputies as a representative of the Conservative Party. Despite this change in politics, he is mainly credited for his early contributions to Romanian literature, most of which reflect his critique of the political mainstream in the monarchical era. He created the stereotype of the cruel, violent and incompetent officer, and brought to public attention the hazing of young recruits.\n\nBacalbașa was a native of Brăila, where his father Costache was serving as Police chief. The family traced its origins to Gorj County, changing their name from \"Telescu\" to \"Bacalbașa\" (literally, \"head of the grocers\") when one of them became leader of a guild in Galați. Costache had a military career in autonomous Wallachia, from 1834 to 1841, then settled in Brăila with his wife Aneta; they had thirteen children, seven of whom died before reaching maturity. According to literary historian George Călinescu, the exact date of Anton's birth is a mystery, but, judging by one of Toni's poems, may be February 21, 1865.\n\nAuthors note that Toni was a passionate and extrovert person, but with a generally weak constitution. Born prematurely, he was reputedly an epileptic. In one of his later poems, Bacalbașa describes himself as unattractive, uncouth, \"wax-faced, dead-eyed\", and pessimistic.\n\nThe boy had difficulties completing his education. He attended school only up to the 8th grade, and, upon turning 17, volunteered for service in the Romanian Land Forces, where he became a Sergeant. He preserved a bittersweet record of his army service, reflected in both \"Moș Teacă\" and some memoirs of military life. According to his own account, he was insulted by a senior officer for not reporting to him concerning the suicide of one recruit; he avenged himself by punching his superior in front of the entire company. Bacalbașa faced a court-martial but, since the recruits refused to report him, was merely demoted.\n\nAfter leaving the Land Forces, he moved to the capital, Bucharest, where he began associating with the left-liberal, Radical and socialist milieus. He was, by various accounts, a good public speaker, who knew how to address the workers, but who avoided issues of doctrine and made ample use of \"mean gibes\" against the politicians in power. Bacalbașa and his brothers became interested in socialist politics at a time when the local socialist movement was taking its first steps. In 1879, Constantin established a leftist magazine, called \"Drepturile Omului\" (\"Human Rights\").\n\nThe Romanian socialist clubs, which first held congress during that year, were still undecided about which school of thought should inspire their agenda: Marxism, Lassallism, Anarchism and Nihilism each had adherents in Romania. The proponents of a non-violent and liberal Marxism, as theorized political refugee Dobrogeanu-Gherea, eventually won the day, and the socialist clubs began constructing programs for a collectivist economy. Anton Bacalbașa had an essential contribution in this process. After 1881, he joined the Marxist group around \"Contemporanul\" magazine. His 1883 brochure, \"Capitalul\", was the first ever introduction to, and summary of, Karl Marx's \"Das Kapital\". Bacalbașa's literary ambitions were satisfied the same year. Some of his poems saw print in the magazine \"Literatorul\", which was put out in Bucharest by writer Alexandru Macedonski.\n\nConstantin Bacalbașa continued to take the initiative when it came to publicizing Gherea's cause. His 1883 magazine \"Emanciparea\" (\"The Emancipation\") made history for circulating portions of Jules Guesde's version of the \"socialist catechism\". As the years progressed, Anton himself joined in the effort: in 1887, he became the editorial director of \"Desrobirea\" (also translatable as \"The Emancipation\"), which advertised itself as a voice of the \"working men party\" (\"partidul lucrătorilor\").\n\nAnton Bacalbașa ran for a seat in the Assembly of Deputies (Ilfov County, 3rd College), during the election of October 1888, picking up just 6 votes. By then, Dobrogeanu-Gherea and his pupils had caught negative attention from the governing Conservative Party, and especially from the Conservatives' political-literary faction, \"Junimea\". In 1889, by means of the socialist press, Bacalbașa popularized the rumor that a Conservative-\"Junimist\" cabinet was working on expelling Gherea from the country. Gherea himself was alarmed by this, and requested an audience with \"Junimea\" leader and Education Minister Titu Maiorescu. Maiorescu reassured Gherea that his followers had no intention of sabotaging the socialist clubs in this disputable manner.\n\nAround that time, Toni and his brothers became members of the Democratic Radical Party, a short-lived and eclectic liberal faction, whose founder and leader was the ex-\"Junimist\" George Panu. Constantin was afterward the publisher of Panu's political newspaper, \"Lupta\". Panu and his men tried to negotiate an alliance against the National Liberal Party (PNL), which had for long been the nominal leftist side of Romania's two-party system. Their program included a promise that the outgoing PNL Prime Minister, Ion Brătianu, would be made to face trial. The PNL's George D. Pallade reported with sarcasm that Panu's promise to fight corruption \"with the Bacalbașas\" could only bring his party votes from \"the naive\".\n\nBoth Toni and Constantin were press delegates to the 1890 Congress of Students in Botoșani, a major affair which involved both Conservatives and socialists. In June 1891, \"Bacalbașa Anton\" was also announced as one of the leading contributors to the literary magazine \"Ecoul Sĕptĕmânii\" (\"The Weekly Echo\"), alongside a gathering of journalists and social activists: Traian Demetrescu, Saniel Grossman, Gheorghe \"din Moldova\" Kernbach, Dumitru Teleor, Maica Smara, Berman Goldner-Giordano etc. Also joining them were draftsmen Nicolae Vermont and Constantin Jiquidi.\n\nToni was later inducted into the Marxist club formed by Constantin Mille at Sotir Hall, Bucharest, and lectured for the public on a weekly basis. Author Constantin Kirițescu, who joined the Sotir group as a 17-year-old, recalls that both men \"carried the brunt\" of organizing and educating the socialist sympathizers. According to journalist I. Felea, Toni, who \"resembled Ferdinand Lassalle in looks and speech\", was a favorite of the Bucharest workers, and made an impression on them by touching the issue of penniless senior citizens. Bacalbașa himself did not have a stable domicile, and slept on the tables at Sotir. By 1893, Kirițescu notes, the task of representing \"Marxist orthodoxy\" had fallen on a new arrival, Ioan Nădejde; the \"occult leader\" Dobrogeanu-Gherea, already \"an invalid\", was rarely visiting the club, and was losing support among the rank and file. Two other figures, Alexandru Ionescu and Alexandru Georgescu, represented the working class on the Sotir presidium, but they were both in the process of becoming prosperous businessmen.\n\nBeginning in early 1892, Toni centered his activity on the industrial hub of Ploiești, where he became managing editor of \"Democrația Socială\" (\"Social Democracy\"). The weekly paper was financed by a lawyer and entrepreneur, Alexandru Radovici, and was originally apolitical, but moved to the left once Bacalbașa took over. He himself lived for a while in the city, and, like Radovici, sat on the Ploiești Workers' Club Executive Committee. \"Democrația Socială\" became a rather important voice for the socialist movement, receiving collaborations from Gherea, Demetrescu, Mille, I. Nădejde, Sofia Nădejde, O. Carp and George Diamandy. According to historian Paul D. Popescu, the editorial opinion was divisible into three factions: Gherea was the evolutionary socialist, Radovici the liberal democrat; Toni, who made a lasting impression among the readers, represented the far left, prophesying the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nAround that date, Anton Bacalbașa endorsed didactic art, as envisaged by Gherea. The socialists were unnerved by Conservative theorists, who countered with the principle of art for art's sake. Initially, this was a direct dispute with \"Junimea\" and Maiorescu. Cultural historian Z. Ornea thus notes that, while Dobrogeanu-Gherea kept silent, his young pupils launched \"a veritable anti-\"Junimist\" campaign\"; among those he lists in this category are Bacalbașa, Demetrescu, S. Nădejde and Garabet Ibrăileanu, along with Dimitrie Anghel, Emil Fagure, Raicu Ionescu-Rion, Henric Sanielevici, Constantin Stere and Avram Steuerman-Rodion. At \"Democrația Socială\", Toni wrote in favor of a workers' art, inspired by the sheer realities of industrial life, and published, in addition to his own short prose, fragments from various socially minded authors—Mór Jókai, Guy de Maupassant, Mircea Rosetti, Ivan Turgenev, Émile Zola etc.\n\nThe busiest part of Toni Bacalbașa's short career covers the years 1893–1894. He had by then befriended the influential satirist Caragiale, and, with him, began work on the humorous gazette \"Moftul Român\". The two authors had different backgrounds: to Bacalbașa's socialism, Caragiale opposed a conservatism formed during his stay with \"Junimea\". Literary historian Tudor Vianu notes that, in a cheerful manner, \"Moftul\" reflected that \"Junimist\" agenda, skeptical toward all cultural innovation. According to philologist Ștefan Cazimir, the magazine was mainly a parody of the neoromantic and modern kitsch, prevalent in the \"fin de siècle\". Its title translates into \"The Romanian Trifle\" or \"The Romanian Nonsense\", referencing one's uppity answer to things presented as new: \"moft!\" (in the same sense of \"bollocks!\"). \"Moftul\" editorials had it that \"moft!\" was a national characteristic, what \"spleen\" is to the English, \"chauvinism\" to the Hungarians, and \"Nihilism\" to the Russians.\n\nCaragiale's paper was in large part poking fun at the nationalist and traditionalist current in Romanian literature, parodying stories about peasant life. A predilect victim was the nationalist scholar and Caragiale critic Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, his life's work of gathering etymological data ridiculed as \"the \"Magnum Mophtologicum\"\". Also featured were Caragiale's first jibes against the Symbolist movement, including lampoons of Bacalbașa's former patron, Alexandru Macedonski. Lastly, \"Moftul Român\" taunted some \"Junimist\" colleagues, including Maiorescu—whom it depicted as a libertine and a seducer of schoolgirls.\n\nAccording to one account, Caragiale himself visited Sotir, where he lectured about the causes and consequences of human stupidity. \"Moftul Român\" did host the occasional socialist article, including an unsigned tribute to May Day, most likely written by Bacalbașa himself. The pieces were many times anonymous, and it is occasionally difficult for researchers to distinguish between Caragiale and Bacalbașa's articles. According to Caragiale expert Șerban Cioculescu, the differences are mostly in style and orthographic preference: Caragiale still used the antiquated Romanian letters \"ĕ\" and \"ê\", while Toni had updated his writing to the latest norms.\n\nIn parallel, Toni completed the first collection of \"Moș Teacă\" stories, printed in Bucharest with the subtitle \"Din cazarmă\" (\"From the Boot Camp\"). Addressing an ethnic Romanian readership in Transylvania and other parts of Austria-Hungary, the cultural journal \"Familia\" introduced Bacalbașa as an active participant to \"the discussion on art\", and reported that the book \"enjoyed an unusually great success\" in a Romanian context.\n\nAfter prolonged debates and negotiations, the various socialist assemblies fused with each other, creating, in March 1893, the PSDMR. It has been described as Romania's \"first nation-wide working-class party\", and called itself \"the vanguard of socialism\" in Romania. Toni Bacalbașa was not delegated by Bucharest to represent the Sotir circle at the original PSDMR Congress, and \"Moftul Român\" published a piece attacking Nădejde for having organized that meeting behind closed doors. He may still have been present at that reunion, representing another club. Toni was also a noted guest at the Sotir meeting acknowledging the party's establishment, addressing a packed hall.\n\nHis political role was recognized by his peers, who nominated him for the Commission drafting the party program, then elected him on the party's governing body (the General Council). Bacalbașa was one of the six people elected by the congress into a ten-member delegation to the Second International's Zurich Congress, but was replaced at the last minute. Meanwhile, superseded by the PSDMR's own press (\"Lumea Nouă\", \"Munca\"), \"Democrația Socială\" closed down. Also in 1893, Constantin Mille took over leadership of the republican daily \"Adevărul\", making it the informal PSDMR platform. Toni was appointed as one of the paper's editors, and authored what is probably the first-ever interview in Romanian media history. The other Bacalbașas were also enlisted by \"Adevărul\": Constantin was one of the main editors; Ioan was famous as the gossip columnist (and infamous for never using commas).\n\nAs noted by journalist Ilie Ighel in \"Familia\", there was a swift transition from republicanism to socialism, effected when some of the old staff left \"Adevărul\". He wrote: \"[instead,] a sinister character emerges, in the person of Anton Bacalbașa, the graduate of two gymnasium classes, along with other unknown celebrities [...]. It is certain that such transitions from one stance to the other have disgusted the cultured public, giving birth to a deep resentment for this sheet that, once taken over by Anton Bacalbașa, did not embrace scientific socialism, [...] but proceeded to insult with brutality all those things that are notable in industry, commerce, finance\". In retrospect, Constantin Bacalbașa also admitted that the socialist takeover was made possible because Alexandru Beldiman, the newspaper's owner, was \"weak-willed\".\nToni was a noisy presence at \"Adevărul\", and for this reason did not get along with Beldiman. According to one account, he and Beldiman got into a war of nerves, interrupting each other's activities with the sound of bells—moving from standard handbells to heavy cowbells. Toni was later assigned to lead the \"Adevărul Literar\" cultural supplement, which gave him the opportunity to engage in major debates over literary theory. Călinescu describes enterprise as reflecting \"the socialist spirit\". When Caragiale lost his position as a civil servant and fell back on money earned with his restaurant, Toni attempted to stir an anti-government reaction among the general public. His publicity stunt, taken up by \"Adevărul Literar\", was a faux obituary, announcing that, if stripped of a salary, Caragiale was (as good as) dead.\n\nSeveral sources note that Bacalbașa was a harsh reviewer of literary works, who made sure to point out the flaws of literary debutantes. In the end, \"Adevărul Literar\" received contributions from, among others, Demetrescu, Constantin Stere (with the pen name \"Un observator ipohondru\", \"A Hypochondriac Observer\"), H. Sanielevici, Simion Sanielevici, Ion Gorun and Artur Stavri. Also featured, on his debut, was the aspiring humorist George Ranetti, who received the signature \"Namuna\", and who referred to Bacalbașa as \"my literary godfather\".\n\nBacalbașa's efforts were again mainly dedicated to the promotion of didactic art. The main cultural battle was no longer carried between the PSDMR and \"Junimea\", but between the socialist and non-socialist advocates of didacticism. \"Adevărul Literar\" directed its passion against author Alexandru Vlahuță and his journal \"Vieața\", whose pro-didactic agenda was more right-wing than Mille's. Vlahuță was already outraged by Caragiale's unsigned parodies in \"Moftul\", calling them the work of \"some stupid parvenu\". His conflict with the Gherea socialists was, according to Călinescu, rather pointless, since Bacalbașa is \"only apparently an adversary of Vlahuță's\". The debate nevertheless grew into a mutual animosity. In one of his letters, Vlahuță feigns shock at the discovery that Toni has judged him to be \"talentless\".\n\nThe dispute over such issues grew more heated as others joined in. According to Kirițescu, Toni's debate with Doctor Alceu Urechia, an anti-didacticist, degenerated into \"a suburbanite airing of dirty laundry\"; while Cosco writes that their quarrel was \"a waste of humor\". When Gherea was challenged from the left by a pseudonymous author, \"I. Saint Pierre\", Bacalbașa and his journal reacted with vehemence, debating over this issue with Steuerman-Rodion, a more moderate socialist chronicler. Yet another target for Toni's criticism was the old historian and novelist Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, who, still grieving for his daughter Iulia, allowed himself to be entirely absorbed into the polemic. Bacalbașa was widely credited as the winner of this collateral dispute, and even Hasdeu was pleasantly surprised by his talents, recommending him as Romania's only genuine journalist.\n\nToni's socialist disciples prolonged the scandal, publishing an offshoot of \"Moftul\", entirely dedicated to satirizing the anti-PSDMR coalition, and titled \"Putregaiul Român\" (\"The Romanian Rot\"). Bacalbașa's political and artistic preoccupations formed the basis for three new books, all printed in 1894. One was dedicated to, and named after, his conference on the topic of \"art for art's sake\" (\"Artă pentru artă\"). Another one was a social pamphlet, \"Bătaia în armată\" (\"Beatings in the Army\"). The third was a selection of novellas, \"Din viața militară\" (\"From the Military Life\"). Also in 1894, Toni and Radovici made new visits to Ploiești, where they recruited members for the socialist movement.\n\nTogether with Mille and other \"Adevărul\" socialists, Toni was openly courting the much larger PNL. In early 1894, he wrote an \"Adevărul\" piece, calling on the PNL to move further to the left, by \"openly embracing the democratic ideals.\" The offer of a liberal-socialist alliance was announced by the PSDMR's own program, but ignored by the PNL; as a result of this attitude, the PSDMR's Diamandy even suggested an alliance with the governing Conservatives. Bacalbașa, Mille and Beldiman were all present at a January 1894 conference, which aimed to coalesce the left into a pressure group for universal suffrage. It reached out to the Radicals and liberal democrats at \"Românul\" and \"Evenimentul\" newspapers, and then to independent agrarian activists (Vasile Kogǎlniceanu, Constantin Dobrescu-Argeș), but, a few months later, broke down into competing factions. On January 24, Toni published in \"Adevărul\" a fairy-tale-like lampoon directed at the Romanian King Carol I of Romania and at his designated successor Ferdinand, caricatured as the \"avaricious\" emperor and the repulsive \"Urechilă\" (\"Floppy Ears\").\n\nA serious scandal erupted in June 1894, when the socialists found themselves targeted by nationalist students mobs, who objected to the PSDMR's alleged snubbing of the Romanians of Transylvania. The demonstrations soon degenerated into an attack on private institutions, including the \"Adevărul\" headquarters. According to the hostile account of Ilie Ighel, this was the public's way of punishing Bacalbașa's proletarian internationalism. \"Familia\" also reported that the students had originally asked Bacalbașa to tone down his agenda, to which he allegedly replied: \"Get out, you dastards!\" Reportedly, the rioters were violently dispersed by the \"Adevărul\" typographers. The Police intervened in the squabble, and placed the \"Adevărul\" building under armed guard. Arrest warrants were issued for the \"Adevărul\" staff: Mille and Alexandru Ionescu were taken into custody and released a short while after, whereas Bacalbașa absconded.\n\nMille's group found a friend in Constantin Stere, by then a maverick member of the PNL, who began maneuvering against the PNL's right-wing from the inside. Managing a literary sheet put out by the pro-PNL \"Evenimentul\", Stere supported \"Adevărul\" in its campaign for literary didacticism, and organized rallies of solidarity with the Bucharest socialists. This happened just as Toni was publishing satirical pieces targeting \"Evenimentul\" owner George A. Scorțescu, which left Stere in an awkward position. Stere was consequently accused by \"Evenimentul\" of being a spy and a tool for the Conservatives. The incidents were reviewed with caution by \"Adevărul\", whose panelists feared that a Conservative conspiracy was in the making, but Toni also criticized the PNL papers for suggesting the same.\n\nWhen Stere challenged Scorțescu to a duel, Bacalbașa covered the affair for \"Adevărul\". Although he condemned Scorțescu's editorial policy, Toni advised Stere to withdraw his demand for satisfaction, or else \"all the crooks and vermin will only have to learn how to duel and that's how the press will be banned from taking a stand.\" In his column of October 1, when he discussed the Conservatives' decision to expel all \"trouble-making\" students, he admitted that the complications of the affair surpassed his power of understanding: \"I could not say [who is right] anymore, there's a sort of black confusion in my mind\".\n\nThe friendship between Bacalbașa and Mille had soured over those months, and Toni soon left \"Adevărul\" for good. It is possible that this rift occurred because of Beldiman, who ceded his stock to Mille without even considering Bacalbașa for a successor. The issue was of interest to the entire socialist movement, since \"Adevărul\" vied for attention with the same niche of the working public. One of Stere's colleagues, the socialist N. Quinezu, denounced Anton Bacalbașa for being in a conflict of interest, for holding a PSDMR office while still working at \"Adevărul\", and for vetoing funds for the PSDMR sheet \"Lumea Nouă\". On September 25, 1894, Bacalbașa presented his resignation from the PSDMR Council. He also reconciled with \"Familia\", where he published his sketch story \"La garda pieții\" (\"Guarding the Marketplace\", December 1894). \"Adevărul Literar\" went out of business on February 13, 1895, and Mille found himself expelled from the PSDMR after the Third Party Congress of April.\n\nDuring that year, Toni was still active in the party, writing for \"Lumea Nouă\" and upholding Gherea's political line. His articles touched a sensitive subject: the Law on Mining, passed by the \"Junimist\" Prime Minister Petre P. Carp, which did away with the PNL's protectionism and greatly increased foreign investment in the Romanian economy. The PSDMR, committed to the Marxist theory on the relations of production, supported the law as a step forward into capitalism, but also criticized it for not allowing a state monopoly on mines. Also that year, Bacalbașa dueled with a certain Bogdanovici, having Caragiale as his witness. The event is remembered in literature because Caragiale, using his trademark black humor, called on the duelers to fire their pistols from a distance of ten paces.\n\nEventually, Bacalbașa formalized his split with the socialist party. From 1896, both he and his rival Scorțescu were members of a PNL splinter group, presided upon by lawyer Nicolae Fleva. He served the \"Flevist\" cause as a writer for \"Dreptatea\" daily, then as a public speaker, organizing rallies at Dacia Hall and agitating the public for the reinstatement of Ghenadie Petrescu as Metropolitan-Primate. All three Bacalbașas, together with Fleva and the \"Lumea Nouă\" socialists (represented by A. Ionescu), also protested when PNL Prime Minister Dimitrie Sturdza expelled Aromanian refugees for having questioned his Balkans policy. Soon, Toni embarked on an additional venture, creating a satirical magazine named after (and featuring stories with) \"Moș Teacă\". In its first series, the periodical hosted a lampoon piece by the young leftist writer Gala Galaction and Toni's own satirical portrait of Caragiale as a political opportunist, gravitating between the \"Junimists\" and George Panu's Radicals.\n\nThe journalist settled down to a family life, marrying Alexandrina Scărișoreanu (who was ten years his younger). He also accepted an offer from Transylvania's \"Vatra\" magazine (co-edited by Caragiale) to set up its satirical supplement \"Hazul\" (\"Fun\"), but the venture failed to interest the public and was abandoned. On March 22, 1898, Bacalbașa began reissuing \"Moș Teacă\", introduced as \"Jurnal Țivil și Cazon\" (\"Civilian and Military Newspaper\"). One of its preferred targets was Mille, referred to in the paper as \"Millu Crocodilu\" (\"Mill[e] the Crocodile\"). The co-author of such material was Ranetti-Namuna, who arrived there after a stint at \"Lupta\".\n\nDuring 1899, Bacalbașa followed Fleva's group as it merged into the Conservative Party. His presence alongside Maiorescu was recorded with displeasure by the \"Junimist\" Ioan Slavici, as one of the reasons why Conservative politics had become ineffectual. A Conservative cabinet was called to power, with Fleva as the Agriculture Minister, and Bacalbașa ran in the general election of 1899, earning an Ilfov County seat in the Assembly of Deputies. Toni still pursued his literary interests: together with \"Constantin Ivan\" (the common pseudonym of his two brothers), he wrote the 3-act political revue \"Pardon!\".\n\nThis was to be his last known endeavor: on October 1, 1899, having contracted bacterial pneumonia, Bacalbașa died, and was buried at Bellu cemetery. Public mourning was taken up by both Fleva and Caragiale. According to the former: \"Through every sort of trouble, through every storm I ever had to cross into, I felt strong knowing that Anton Bacalbașa was with me. It is to his talent, his heart and his friendship that I owe the best years of my public life.\" The same year, the PSDMR itself disappeared from the scene: Ioan Nădejde and his \"generous ones\" faction denounced socialist politics as too feeble for the Romanian context, and joined the PNL, leaving a minority, under C. Z. Buzdugan, I. C. Frimu and Christian Rakovsky, to establish a more radical workers' party (embryo of the post-1910 Social Democratic Party).\n\nDuring his 1890s polemics, Anton Bacalbașa explained at length what his vision of didacticism meant. His stated belief was that: \"In all of our works, that which is alive first and foremost is ourselves.\" Nevertheless, George Călinescu writes, Toni \"was far from pouring socialism over everything\", and believed that poetry in particular should be apolitical. As early as 1894, Avram Steuerman-Rodion noted that the \"Adevărul Literar\" editor had been straying away from Dobrogeanu-Gherea's didactic path.\n\n\"Moș Teacă\", which endures as Bacalbașa's best liked series, is a tragicomic account of military life. The eponymous hero is a grotesque Army Captain, who is comically illiterate but savage in his treatment of the recruits. The reader never learns his actual name, but only his nickname, literally \"Old Man Scabbard\", but also rendered as \"Captain Scabbard\" (Bacalbașa hints that derogatory nicknames were commonly used by the recruits when referring to their unpopular superiors). It is generally held that Toni's anti-hero is in large part inspired by a standard of French literature, in particular by Charles Leroy's \"Col. Ramollot\" and Henry Monnier's \"Joseph Prudhomme\". This interpretation is nuanced by researcher Constantin Ciopraga, who argues: \"As a former army volunteer, the future journalist Bacalbașa did not need the French model proposed by Charles Leroy in \"Le Colonel Ramollot\"; he was directly familiarized with the Prussian spirit of yesteryear.\"\n\nMoș Teacă has lived all his life in the army, having been a drummer boy by vocation. His obtuse nature greatly disturbs his understanding of civilian affairs: when he is informed that the Dâmbovița River has swelled, he asks, \"Who gave the order for this?\" He provides his men with incomprehensible advice on how to march, instructs them how to make a polite retreat if the enemy catches them without a weapon, and, while on maneuvers on the Prut River, orders them to combat the epizootic with a verbal inspection of the cattle.\n\nTeacă and the other infantry officers are especially violent toward the recruits, and use a wide inventory of corporal punishments, on an advancing scale. In addition to hitting the young soldiers (with their bare knuckles, with sword belts, or with sticks), they force some to run around for hours with a \"bitch\" (the regimental Maxim gun) on their back, or to hold aim while staring directly into the sun. In \"La garda pieții\", the soldiers react badly to injustice and stage a protest, but their effort is ultimately wasted by intrigues. Other categories of servicemen are also touched by Bacalbașa's wit. His stories show military medicine as a grim spectacle: the physicians are either criminally incompetent or sadistic, driving recruits to the brink of suicide. The elite cavalry (\"Roșiori\") show particular restraint in public, but are merciless in dealing with their young subordinates.\n\nArmy men were generally irritated by Bacalbașa's comedy. Some ten years after the author's death, General Brătianu commented that Moș Teacă was the stuff of imagination, and propaganda \"for the naive\". Toni himself probably intended to make Teacă reach beyond the topic of antimilitarism. As he explained, Teacă might just as well be active in environments other than the boot camp, from the marketplace to the Senate of Romania. In order to ridicule his colleagues in the media, Bacalbașa created an alternative character, the self-seeking newspaperman \"Spanachidi\" (said to have been based on a real-life model).\n\nBacalbașa's other humorous works are scattered. Călinescu describes him as a restless \"buffoon\" and \"an unpretentious journalist\", but acknowledges that his French wit and verve have raised the level of Romania's media. Toni's parodies of Symbolism, published in \"Moftul Român\", are described by Cioculescu as even better than those signed by Caragiale, since they hit closer to \"the mark\". Many of his other written contributions are homographic one-line jokes, or samples of absurd humor in the \"épater la bourgeoisie\" tradition, while his memoirs record the involuntarily humorous rhyming of a poet-soldier. Călinescu finds them amusing but, in large part, copied from the French prankster Alfred Jarry (\"the technique of \"Ubuesque\" humorists\"). Both Anton and Constantin Bacalbașa were also early pioneers of the Romanian epigram genre, which the former helped popularize at \"Moftul\".\n\nSome of Bacalbașa's writings are of a more restrained nature, and even include somber pieces. A younger colleague, C. Cosco, recalled: \"We [journalists] knew that, under his ferocious sarcasm, under his biting wit, he was hiding the sentimentality of a German maiden.\" In his more serious poems, Toni follows the model set by \"Junimea\"s Mihai Eminescu. In a controversial article he wrote in 1890, Toni asserted that Eminescu was a unique genius, who did not fit in with any school of literature.\n\nFollowing Toni's death, Alexandrina Bacalbașa remarried, to the Transylvanian literato Nerva Hodoș. She survived her second husband by several decades. When she died, in 1954, she was buried next to her first husband.\n\nA final \"Moș Teacă\" almanac was put out in 1900, featuring the sketch \"Ion prostul\" (\"Stupid Ion\"), which, although believed by the publisher to be Bacalbașa's work, may in fact be a forgotten contribution by Caragiale. At around that time, George Ranetti also tried to revive \"Moș Teacă\" magazine, and continued to write humorous pieces in the manner introduced by Caragiale and Toni (a subject-matter that Călinescu has named \"Moftology\"). \"Moș Teacă\" grew in scope, and began publishing satires of Christianity. These earned it a poor reputation in the media, created a political controversy, and nearly resulted in a trial of Ranetti. Additionally, Ranetti used one of Bacalbașa's final texts as preface to a collection of jokes, which saw print in 1901. Caragiale also revived \"Moftul Român\" for a second series, wherein he continued to poke fun at the Symbolists and awarded a special prize to the stupidest literary work sent in for publishing.\n\nThe Bacalbașa genre had other significant effects on Romanian literature, and in particular on comedy-writing. \"Moș Teacă\" proved influential for the work of other Romanian writers, who were active in the interwar period: Gheorghe Brăescu, then Neagu Rădulescu. The name itself was virtually turned into a common noun (\"un moș teacă\"), applied to army men who are thought to display the same characteristics as Bacalbașa's anti-hero. In Romanian cuisine, the writer's name was given to a \"delicatessen\" variety of smoked ham.\n\nIn addition to Kirițescu and Cosco's notes, Toni was the subject of a 1924 monograph by socialist critic Barbu Lăzăreanu, and of a 1938 memoir by his \"Adevărul\" acquaintance Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan. In the 1930s, the aged Constantin Stere wrote his deceased friend into the autobiographical novel \"În preajma revoluției\", as \"Toni Baclava\".\n\nAfter 1948, Bacalbașa's republicanism made him a favorite of the communist regime. In the 1950s, his anti-monarchic work was central to the Romanian curriculum, alongside selected pieces by other hand-picked republicans-socialists (N. D. Cocea, Traian Demetrescu, Dumitru Theodor Neculuță, Alexandru Toma). However, the anonymous \"Moftul Român\" articles which were evidently pro-socialist, and which are most likely Toni's contributions, were attributed to Caragiale by official authors such as Camil Petrescu. This was a counter-factual effort of transforming the \"Junimist\" writer into a champion of the left.\n\n"}
{"id": "151440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151440", "title": "Benjamin Henry Latrobe", "text": "Benjamin Henry Latrobe\n\nBenjamin Henry Boneval Latrobe (May 1, 1764 – September 3, 1820) was a British neoclassical architect who emigrated to the United States. He was one of the first formally trained, professional architects in the new United States, drawing on influences from his travels in Italy, as well as British and French Neoclassical architects such as Claude Nicolas Ledoux. In his thirties, he emigrated to the new United States and designed the United States Capitol, on \"Capitol Hill\" in Washington, D.C., as well as the Old Baltimore Cathedral or The Baltimore Basilica, (later renamed the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary). It is the first Roman Catholic Cathedral constructed in the United States. Latrobe also designed the largest structure in America at the time, the \"Merchants' Exchange\" in Baltimore. With extensive balconied atriums through the wings and a large central rotunda under a low dome which dominated the city, it was completed in 1820 after five years of work and endured into the early twentieth century.\n\nLatrobe emigrated in 1796, initially settling in Virginia where he worked on the Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond. Latrobe then moved to Philadelphia where he established his practice. In 1803, he was hired as Surveyor of the Public Buildings of the United States, and spent much of the next fourteen years working on projects in the new national capital of Washington, D.C., (in the newly-laid out Federal capital of the District of Columbia) where he served as the second Architect of the Capitol. He also was responsible for the design of the White House porticos. Latrobe spent the later years of his life in New Orleans, Louisiana working on a waterworks project, and died there in 1820 from yellow fever.\n\nLatrobe has been called the \"father of American architecture\". He was the uncle of Charles La Trobe, who was the first Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria in Australia.\n\nLatrobe was born on May 1, 1764, at the Fulneck Moravian Settlement, near Pudsey in the city of Leeds, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. His parents were the Reverend Benjamin Latrobe, a leader of the Moravian Church who was of Huguenot (French Protestant) ancestry, and Anna Margaretta Antes to a German father and maternal Dutch descent. Antes was born in the American colony of Pennsylvania, but was sent to England by her father, a wealthy landowner, to attend a Moravian school at Fulneck.\n\nLatrobe's father, who was responsible for all Moravian schools and establishments in Britain, had an extensive circle of friends in the higher ranks of society. He stressed the importance of education, scholarship, and the value of social exchange; while Latrobe's mother instilled in her son a curiosity and interest in America. From a young age, Benjamin Henry Latrobe enjoyed drawing landscapes and buildings. He was a brother of Moravian leader and musical composer Christian Ignatius Latrobe.\n\nIn 1776, at the age of twelve, Latrobe was sent away to a Moravian School at Niesky in Upper Lusatia, near the border of the German principalities of Saxony and Prussia, where his brother was studying. At age eighteen, he spent several months traveling around Germany, and then joined the Royal Prussian Army, becoming close friends with a distinguished officer in the United States Army. Latrobe also may have served briefly in the Austrian Imperial Army, and suffered some injuries or illness. After recovering, he embarked on a continental \"Grand Tour\", visiting eastern Saxony, Paris, Italy, and other places. Through his education and travels, Latrobe mastered German, French, ancient and modern Greek, and Latin. He had advanced ability in Italian and Spanish and some knowledge of Hebrew. Latrobe was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.\n\nHis son, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, II, (sometimes referred to as \"Junior\"), also worked as a civil engineer. In 1827, he joined the newly organized Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and designed the longest, most challenging bridge on its initial route: the curving Thomas Viaduct, (the third of four multi-arched \"viaducts\"). \n\nAnother son, John Hazlehurst Boneval Latrobe (1803–91), was a noted civic leader, lawyer, author, historian, artist, inventor, intellectual, and social activist in Maryland. \n\nA grandson, Charles Hazlehurst Latrobe (1834–1902), Benjamin Henry Latrobe II's son, a Confederate soldier, also continued the tradition of architect and engineer, building bridges for the city and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Latrobe Park in south Baltimore is named for the family, as is Latrobe Park, New Orleans, in the French Quarter.\n\nLatrobe returned to England in 1784, and was apprenticed to John Smeaton, an engineer known for designing Eddystone Lighthouse. Then in 1787 or 1788, he worked in the office of neoclassical architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell for a brief time. In 1790, Latrobe was appointed Surveyor of the Public Offices in London, and established his own private practice in 1791. Latrobe was commissioned in 1792 to design Hammerwood Lodge, near East Grinstead in Sussex, his first independent work, and he designed nearby Ashdown House in 1793. Latrobe was involved in construction of the Basingstoke Canal in Surrey, together with engineers John Smeaton and William Jessop. In spring 1793, Latrobe was hired to plan improvements to the River Blackwater from Maldon to Beeleigh, so that the port of Maldon could compete with the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation, which bypassed the town. The project lasted until early 1795, when Parliament denied approval of his plan. Latrobe had problems getting payment for his work on the project, and faced bankruptcy.\n\nIn February 1790, Latrobe married Lydia Sellon, and they lived a busy social life in London. The couple had a daughter (Lydia Sellon Latrobe) and a son (Henry Sellon Boneval Latrobe), before she died giving birth during November 1793. Lydia had inherited her father's wealth, which in turn was to be left to the children through a trust with the children's uncles, but never ended up going to the children. In 1795, Latrobe suffered a breakdown and decided to emigrate to America, departing on November 25 aboard the \"Eliza\".\n\nIn America, Latrobe was known for his series of topological and landscape watercolors; the series started with a view of the White Cliffs of the south coast of England viewed from the \"Eliza\". The series was preceded by a watercolor of East Grinstead, dated September 8, 1795.\n\nLatrobe arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, in mid-March 1796 after a harrowing four-month journey aboard the ship, which was plagued with food shortages under near-starvation conditions. Latrobe initially spent time in Norfolk, where he designed the \"William Pennock House,\" then set out for Richmond in April 1796. Soon after arriving in Virginia, Latrobe became friends with Bushrod Washington, nephew of President George Washington, along with Edmund Randolph and other notable figures. Through Bushrod Washington, Latrobe was able to pay a visit to Mount Vernon to meet with the president in the summer of 1796.\n\nLatrobe's first major project in the United States was the State Penitentiary in Richmond, commissioned in 1797. The penitentiary included many innovative ideas in penal reform, then being espoused by Thomas Jefferson and various other figures, including cells arranged in a semicircle, similar, but not identical to Jeremy Bentham's panopticon, that allowed for easy surveillance, as well as improved living conditions for sanitation and ventilation. He also pioneered the use of solitary confinement in the Richmond penitentiary. While in Virginia, Latrobe worked on the Green Spring mansion near Williamsburg, which had been built by Governor Sir William Berkeley in the seventeenth century but fell into disrepair after the American Revolutionary War. Latrobe created designs for Fort Nelson in Virginia in 1798. He also made drawings for a number of houses that were not built, including the \"Mill Hill\" plantation house near Richmond.\n\nAfter spending a year in Virginia, the novelty of being in a new place wore off, and Latrobe was lonely and restless in Virginia. Giambattista Scandella, a friend, suggested Philadelphia as an ideal location for him. In April 1798, Latrobe visited Philadelphia for the first time, meeting with Bank of Pennsylvania president Samuel J. Fox, and presented to him a design for a new bank building. At the time, the political climate in Philadelphia was quite different than Virginia, with a strong division between the Federalists and Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans, along with anti-French sentiment, thus the city was not entirely welcoming for Latrobe. On his way to Philadelphia, Latrobe passed through the national capital city of Washington, D.C., then under construction (congress and the president would not arrive until the year 1800), where he met with the first architect of the capitol, William Thornton, and viewed the United States Capitol for the first time. He stopped by Washington again on his way back to Richmond. Latrobe remained in Richmond, Virginia, until November 1798, when his design was selected for the Bank of Pennsylvania. He moved to Philadelphia, so that he could supervise the construction, although he continued to do occasional projects for clients in Virginia.\n\nBy the time he arrived in Philadelphia, Latrobe's two friends, Scandella and Volney, had left due to concerns regarding the Alien and Sedition Acts, but Latrobe made friends with some of their acquaintances at the American Philosophical Society. Latrobe submitted several papers to the society, on his geology and natural history observations, and became a member of the society. With his charming personality, Latrobe quickly made other friends among the influential financial and business families in Philadelphia, and became close friends with Nicholas Roosevelt, a talented steam-engine builder who would help Latrobe in his waterworks projects.\n\nLatrobe's first major project in Philadelphia was to design the Bank of Pennsylvania, which was the first example of Greek Revival architecture in the United States. It was demolished in 1870. This commission is what convinced him to set up his practice in Philadelphia, where he developed his reputation.\n\nLatrobe also was hired to design the Center Square Water Works in Philadelphia. The Pump House, located on the common at Broad and Market Streets (now the site of Philadelphia City Hall), was designed by Latrobe in a Greek Revival style. It drew water from the Schuylkill River, a mile away, and contained two steam engines that pumped it into wooden tanks in its tower. Gravity then fed the water by wooden mains into houses and businesses. Following his work on the Philadelphia water works project, Latrobe worked as an engineer of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.\n\nIn addition to Greek Revival designs, Latrobe also used Gothic Revival designs in many of his works, including the 1799 design of Sedgeley, a country mansion in Philadelphia. The Gothic Revival style was used in Latrobe's design of the Philadelphia Bank building as well, which was built in 1807 and demolished in 1836. As a young architect, Robert Mills worked as an assistant with Latrobe from 1803 until 1808 when he set up his own practice.\n\nWhile in Philadelphia, Latrobe married Mary Elizabeth Hazlehurst (1771–1841), in 1800. The couple had several children together.\n\nIn the United States, Latrobe quickly achieved eminence as the first professional architect working in the country. Latrobe was a friend of Thomas Jefferson, likely influencing Jefferson's design for the University of Virginia. Latrobe also knew James Monroe, as well as New Orleans architect and pirate, Barthelemy Lafon, was Aaron Burr's preferred architect, and he trained architect William Strickland.\n\nIn 1803, Jefferson hired Latrobe as Surveyor of the Public Buildings of the United States, and to work as superintendent of construction of the United States Capitol. As construction of the capitol was already underway, Latrobe was tasked to work with William Thornton's plans, which Latrobe criticized. In an 1803 letter to Vice President Aaron Burr, he characterized the plans and work done as \"faulty construction\". Nonetheless, President Thomas Jefferson insisted that Latrobe follow Thornton's design for the capitol.\n\nAlthough Latrobe's major work was overseeing construction of the United States Capitol, he also was responsible for numerous other projects in Washington. In 1804, became chief engineer in the United States Navy. As chief surveyor, Latrobe was responsible for the Washington Canal. Latrobe faced bureaucratic hurdles in moving forward with the canal, with the directors of the company rejecting his request for stone locks. Instead, the canal was built with wooden locks, which were subsequently destroyed in a heavy storm in 1811. Latrobe also designed the main gate of the Washington Navy Yard. Latrobe worked on other transportation projects in Washington, D.C., including the Washington and Alexandria Turnpike, which connected Washington with Alexandria, as well as a road connecting with Frederick, Maryland, and a third road, the Columbia Turnpike going through Bladensburg to Baltimore. Latrobe also provided consulting on the construction of the Washington Bridge across the Potomac River in a way that would not impede navigation and commerce to Georgetown.\n\nBenjamin Latrobe was responsible for several other projects located around Lafayette Square, including St. John's Episcopal Church, Decatur House, and the White House porticos. Private homes designed by Latrobe include commissions by John P. Van Ness and Peter Casanove.\n\nIn June 1812, construction of the Capitol came to a halt with the outbreak of the War of 1812 and the failure of the First Bank of the United States. During the war, Latrobe relocated to Pittsburgh, and returned to Washington in 1815, as Architect of the Capitol, charged with responsibility of rebuilding the capitol after it was destroyed in the war. Latrobe was given more freedom in rebuilding the capitol, to apply his own design elements for the interior. Through much of Latrobe's time in Washington, he remained involved with his private practice to some extent and with other projects in Philadelphia and elsewhere. His clerk of works, John Lenthal, often urged Latrobe to spend more time in Washington.\n\nBy 1817, Latrobe had provided President James Monroe with complete drawings for the entire building. He resigned as Architect of the Capitol on November 20, 1817, and without this major commission, Latrobe faced difficulties and was forced into bankruptcy. Latrobe left Washington, for Baltimore in January 1818.\n\nLatrobe left Washington with pessimism, with the city's design contradicting many of his ideals. Latrobe disliked the Baroque-style plan for the city, and other aspects of L'Enfant's plan, and resented having to conform to Thornton's plans for the Capitol Building. One of the greatest problems with the overall city plan, in the view of Latrobe, was its vast interior distances, and Latrobe considered the Washington Canal as a key factor that, if successful, could help alleviate this issue. Latrobe also had concerns about the city's economic potential, and argued for constructing a road connecting Washington with Frederick to the northwest to enhance economic commerce through Washington.\n\nLatrobe also worked on projects in Baltimore, including the Old Baltimore Cathedral or Baltimore Basilica, the surviving first Roman Catholic Cathedral constructed in the United States, commissioned by John Carroll, first Bishop in America for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baltimore. Construction of the old Baltimore Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary (later elevated to a Basilica) on Cathedral Hill at Cathedral Street, between West Franklin and Mulberry Streets, commenced in 1806 and the incomplete building was opened in 1821, after several financial setbacks slowed construction.\n\nLatrobe also worked on the \"Baltimore Exchange\" (also known as the \"Merchants' Exchange\") project beginning in 1816 to 1819/21/?? – which became the largest domed building in America – an originally planned H-shaped, four-story building facing South Gay Street with its north wing along Second (later Water) Street and its south wing along East Lombard Street. A large, impressive rotunda lay under the low dome with a catwalk promenade along the second-floor level of the interior atrium, with space for various federal offices of the Customs Service, U. S. Courthouse, Post Office, and a branch of the Bank of the United States; other wings housing an early location of City Hall with offices for the municipal government of Baltimore; and offices for shipping companies, brokers, attorneys, and other maritime businesses. On the western wing side (adjacent to Commerce Street), the \"Exchange Hotel\" of five stories was constructed, which lasted until 1870 when it was replaced by an annex for the Post Office.\n\nAs years went by, the city government moved out in 1830 to a temporary City Hall of its own at the old Peale Museum farther north on Holliday Street (until 1875, when the block-sized current City Hall was dedicated); a new U. S. Courthouse was constructed in 1862–65 (dedicated in 1860??), with President James Buchanan in attendance, at the northwest corner of East Fayette and North Streets (now Guilford Avenue) – site of old colonial, twin-spired First Presbyterian Church; and in 1889 a newer Federal Courthouse, along with a General Post Office, of Italian Renaissance-style with nine towers including a large central clock tower, for the embellishment of the city, was constructed on the east side of Battle Monument Square at North Calvert and East Fayette Streets. This was west of the older Civil War-era U. S. courthouse, which was razed in 1907 for an eastern extension-annex of the 1889 Federal Courthouse and Post Office. \n\nLatrobe's landmark structure, a block north of the waterfront and wharves of \"the Basin\" (now the \"Inner Harbor\") on the northern shore of the northwest branch of the Patapsco River, which forms Baltimore Harbor, was the site of a number of important events in the nineteenth century, including the 1865 viewing of President Abraham Lincoln's coffin in the rotunda under the low dome, midway in the funeral procession through the streets of the city on its one-day stop in Baltimore, during its week-long journey by train through Northern cities and to Springfield, Illinois, for burial.\n\nThe \"Exchange\" formed the largest commercial structure in America and one of the most important landmarks in nineteenth-century Baltimore. It lasted until unfortunately, being razed around 1902. It was replaced by the beaux-arts classical granite and marble structure of a new U. S. Customs House, for which the cornerstone was laid in 1903. Although the Great Baltimore Fire of February 7–8, 1904, swept over the unfinished foundation along with the entire central business district, construction resumed. The building was dedicated in 1906 and is noted for the beautiful historical maritime murals in its massive \"Call Room\" in the seldom-seen interior. Over the years, additional Treasury and Justice Departmental units and agencies have used that building for offices and security details. It was also the location of significant protest demonstrations against the Selective Service System and against U. S. involvement in the Vietnam War, during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nLatrobe also had hopes of generating more financial capital to use for the waterworks project, completing that project in 1818. He left for New Orleans, Louisiana, in December 1818, arriving on January 10, 1819.\n\nLatrobe saw great potential for growth in New Orleans, situated at the mouth of the Mississippi River, with the advent of the steamboat and great interest in steamboat technology. Latrobe's first project in New Orleans was the first New Orleans United States Customs building, constructed in 1807.\n\nIn 1810 Latrobe sent his son, Henry Sellon \"Boneval\" Latrobe, to the city to present a plan for a waterworks system to the New Orleans city council. Latrobe's plan for the waterworks system was based on that of Philadelphia, which he earlier designed. The system in Philadelphia was created as a response to yellow fever epidemics affecting the city. Latrobe's system used steam pumps to move water from the Schuylkill River to a reservoir, located upstream; so that gravity could be used to transmit the water from there to residents in the city. The New Orleans waterworks project also was designed to desalinate water, using steam-powered pumps. While in New Orleans, Latrobe's son participated in the Battle of New Orleans and took on other projects including building a lighthouse, a new Charity Hospital, and the French Opera House.\n\nNew Orleans agreed to commission the waterworks project in 1811, although Latrobe was not ready to take on the project immediately and faced financial problems in securing enough investors for the project. His work on the United States Capitol was completed shortly before the War of 1812 started, ending his source of steady income. During the war Latrobe unsuccessfully tried several wartime schemes to make money, including some steamboat projects. In 1814, Latrobe partnered with Robert Fulton in a steamship venture based at Pittsburgh. While in Pittsburgh, Latrobe designed and built a theater for the Circus of Pepin and Breschard. After the U. S. Capitol and White House were burned by the British Army, Latrobe remained in Washington to help with rebuilding, and Latrobe's son took on much of the work for the New Orleans waterworks project.\n\nLatrobe faced further delays trying to get an engine built for the waterworks, which he finally accomplished in 1819. The process of designing and constructing the waterworks system in New Orleans spanned eleven years. In addition to this project, Latrobe designed the central tower of the St. Louis Cathedral, which was his last architectural project. \n\nLatrobe died September 3, 1820, from yellow fever, while working in Louisiana. He was buried in the Protestant section of the Saint Louis Cemetery in New Orleans, where his eldest son, architect Henry Sellon Boneval Latrobe (1792–1817), was buried three years earlier, having also succumbed to yellow fever.\n\nWhile studying in Germany, Latrobe was mentored by Baron Karl von Schachmann, a classical scholar interested in art and collecting. Around 1783, Latrobe made the decision to become an architect, a decision influenced by the baron. While Latrobe was in Germany, a new architectural movement, led by Carl Gotthard Langhans and others, was emerging with return to more Classical or Vitruvian designs.\n\nIn 1784, Latrobe set off on a Grand Tour around Europe, visiting Paris where the Panthéon, a church dedicated to St. Genevieve, was nearing completion. The Panthéon in Paris, designed by Jacques Germain Soufflot and Jean-Baptiste Rondelet, represented an early example of Neoclassicism. At that time, Claude Nicolas Ledoux was designing numerous houses in France, in Neoclassical style. Latrobe also visited Rome, where he was impressed by the Roman Pantheon and other ancient structures with Greek influence. Influential architects in Britain, at the time when Latrobe returned in 1784, adhered to a number of different styles. Sir William Chambers was at the forefront, designing in Palladianism style, while Chambers' rival, Robert Adam's designs had Roman influence, in a style known as Adam style. Latrobe was not interested in either the Palladian nor Adam style, but Neoclassicalism also was being introduced to Great Britain at the time by George Dance the Younger. Other British architects, including John Soane and Henry Holland, also designed in the Neoclassical style while Latrobe was in London.\n\nDuring his European tour, Latrobe gathered ideas on how American cities should be designed. He suggested city blocks be laid out as thin rectangles, with the long side of the blocks oriented east-west so that as many houses as possible could face south. For a city to succeed, he thought it needed to be established only in places with good prospects for commerce and industrial growth, and with a good water supply. \n\nPublic health was another key consideration of Latrobe, who believed that the eastern shores of rivers were unhealthy, due to prevailing direction of the wind, and recommended cities be built on the western shores of rivers.\n\nLatrobe brought from England influences of British Neoclassicism, and was able to combine it with styles introduced by Thomas Jefferson, to devise an American Greek Revival style. John Summerson described the Bank of Pennsylvania, as an example of how Latrobe \"married English Neo-Classicism to Jeffersonian Neo-Classicism [and] ... from that moment, the classical revival in America took on a national form\". The American form of Greek Revival architecture that Latrobe developed became associated with political ideals of democracy—a meaning that was less apparent in Britain. The direct link between the Greek Revival architecture and American democracy has been disputed by recent scholars such as W. Barksdale Maynard, who sees the Greek Revival as an international phenomenon.\n\nWhen Latrobe began private practice in England, his first projects were alterations to existing houses, designing Hammerwood Park, and designing Ashdown House, East Sussex. Alterations completed early in his career may have included Tanton Hall, Sheffield Park, Frimley, and Teston Hall, although these homes have since been altered and it is difficult now to isolate Latrobe's work in the current designs. His designs were simpler than was typical at the time, and had influences of Robert Adam. Features in his designs often included as part of the front porticos, Greek ionic columns, as used in Ashdown House, or doric columns, seen in Hammerwood Park.\n\nLatrobe continued to design houses after he emigrated to the United States, mostly using Greek Revival designs. Four houses still stand that Latrobe designed: the Decatur House in Washington, D.C.; Adena in Chillicothe, Ohio; the Pope Villa in Lexington, Kentucky; and the Sedgeley Porter's house in Philadelphia. As one of Latrobe's most avant-garde designs, the Pope Villa has national significance for its unique design. He also introduced Gothic Revival architecture to the United States with the design of Sedgeley. The mansion was built in 1799 and demolished in 1857; however, the stone Porter's house at Sedgeley remains as his only extant building in Philadelphia. A theme seen in many of Latrobe's designs is plans with squarish-dimensions and a central, multi-story hall with a cupola to provide lighting, which was contrary to the popular trend of the time of building houses with long narrow plans.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4318522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4318522", "title": "Critical Art Ensemble", "text": "Critical Art Ensemble\n\nCritical Art Ensemble (CAE) is a collective of five tactical media practitioners of various specializations including computer graphics and web design, film/video, photography, text art, book art, and performance. For CAE, tactical media is situational, ephemeral, and self-terminating. It encourages the use of any media that will engage a particular socio-political context in order to create molecular interventions and semiotic shocks that collectively could diminish the rising intensity of authoritarian culture.\nSince its formation in 1987 in Tallahassee, Florida, CAE has been frequently invited to exhibit and perform projects examining issues surrounding information, communications and bio-technologies by museums and other cultural institutions. These include the Whitney Museum and the New Museum in NYC; the Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; the ICA, London; the MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; the London Museum of Natural History; Kunsthalle Luzern, and dOCUMENTA 13.\n\nThe collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages.\n\nIts work has been covered by art journals, including Artforum, Kunstforum, and The Drama Review. Critical Art Ensemble is the recipient of awards, including the 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of Artistic Expression Grant, the 2004 John Lansdown Award for Multimedia, and the 2004 Leonardo New Horizons Award for Innovation.\n\nFormed in 1987, CAE's focus has been on the exploration of the intersections between art, critical theory, technology, and political activism. In 1986, Steve Kurtz and Steve Barnes began a collaboration to make low-tech videos with students. They credited each person who contributed to the productions under the signature of Critical Art Ensemble. During the summer of 1987, the group transformed into a broad-based artist and activist collective with six core members: Steve Kurtz, Steve Barnes, Dorian Burr, Beverly Schlee, Ricardo Dominguez (professor) and Hope Kurtz. In 1987, the group's first multimedia exhibitions were held at Club Nu in Miami and Pappy's Lounge in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1988, the group's first events are produced: \"Political Art In Florida?\" in collaboration with Group Material, and \"Frontier Production\" in collaboration with Thomas Lawson. In 1988-89, CAE begin to release their books of plagiarist text poetry (of which there are six in all). In 1989, the group collaborate with Gran Fury to release \"Cultural Vaccines\", a multimedia event in Tallahassee, Florida, which critiques U.S. policy on HIV. In 1990, the group collaborated with Prostitutes of New York to create \"Peep Show\" which premiered at Window on Gaines in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nIn 1991, a body of work titled \"Fiesta Critica\" was developed in Indiantown, Florida, with local migrant workers; addressing Floridian agricultural labour relations. CAE produces an Easter fiesta platform to show the works. In 1992, the group produces \"Exit Culture\" as a series of works developed for Highway Culture. They also propose \"The Electronic Disturbance\" to Autonomedia publishers. In 1993, the group is invited to perform their first appearance in Europe at the Audio/Visual Experimental festival in the Netherlands. They complete the associational documentary series \"Apocalypse and Utopia\". In 1994, Autonomedia publishes \"The Electronic Disturbance\" and construction begins to create CAE's website Critical Art Ensemble. CAE projects begin to appear in both real and virtual forms as the \"Useless Technology\" project is performed as street action and launched online. The concept of electronic civil disobedience is introduced at the \"Terminal Futures\" conference in London. In 1995, the concept of the data body is introduced in lectures at the Ars Electronica. The group tours around Europe with the performance of \"Body Count\".\n\nIn 1996, Autonomedia publishes \"Electronic Civil Disobedience\" (the companion text to \"The Electronic Disturbance\"), and research begins for the book \"Flesh Machine\". In 1997, the group tours \"Flesh Frontiers and Shareholder's Briefing\". Castelvecchi publishes the Italian translation of \"The Electronic Disturbance\". The group goes to Documenta X in Kassel, Germany to begin the editing and conceptualizing process for the book \"README: Ascii Culture and the Revenge of Knowledge\" at Hybrid Workspace. The performance of \"Flesh Machine\" is toured, premiering in Vienna and closing in Helsinki at Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in summer 1998. L'Eclat publishes the French anthology of CAE's writings titled \"La Resistance Electronique\". In 1998, Autonomedia publishes \"Flesh Machine\" and the German translation is published by Passagen. The group's street action occurs in Sheffield, UK, with the performance of \"The International Campaign for Free Alcohol and Tobacco for the Unemployed\". Castelvecchi publishes the Italian translation of \"Electronic Civil Disobedience\". In 1999, \"The Society for Reproductive Anachronisms\" is premiered at Rutgers University in the student cafeteria. Work begins on \"Cult of the New Eve\" (CoNE) and is premiered at St. Clara Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. A new book project is begun, entitled \"Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media\". In 2000, Autonomedia publishes \"Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media\" and the German anthology of CAE's writings on electronic media is published by Passagen.\n\nThe group has exhibited and performed at diverse venues internationally, ranging from the street, to the museum, to the internet. Museum exhibitions include the Whitney Museum and The New Museum in NYC; The Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; The ICA, London; The MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; and The London Museum of Natural History. Critical Art Ensemble\n\nFree Range Grain was a performance-based project which tested foods to contest the global food trade system. The project used basic molecular biology techniques over a 72-hour period to test foods that others deemed suspicious of \"contamination\" even when the authorities were guarding against them. This performance sought to explore biotechnology and the science behind it, as the artists felt it was \"one of the most misunderstood areas of production in the cultural landscape\".\n\nIn its performances, CAE creates various performative identities, such as that of a group of scientists or a corporation. Instead of using fancy, high-tech machinery they use 'high school lab equipment as well as common household supplies and groceries', which brings the scientific difficulty down to a level at which the public can understand and engage with because the worlds of science and technology in the modern world are 'increasingly privatised'. This playful style, however, contrasts with the groups numerous books and manifestos which have an analytical focus.\n\nNicola Triscott is the founder of The Arts Catalyst. In her writings about the CAE, she states that their participatory theatre 'aims to involve the public in the processes of biotechnology in order to contribute to the development of an informed and critical public discourse on contemporary bioscience'. This provides people with knowledge of how science can be interesting and that it can be misused if in the wrong hands. Their works have ranged from genetically modified food, the Human Genome Project (CoNE), reproductive technologies, genetic screening and transgenics. The way they approach this style is through directly engaging with the science and presenting techniques generally unknown to the public in a performative way.\n\nThe collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages. Its books include: \"The Electronic Disturbance\" (1994), \"Electronic Civil Disobedience & Other Unpopular Ideas\" (1996), \"Flesh Machine: Cyborgs, Designer Babies, & New Eugenic Consciousness\" (1998), \"Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media\" (2001), \"Molecular Invasion\" (2002), \"Marching Plague\" (2006), and the project book \"Disturbances\" (2012).\n\nCAE is noted for having written the article Nomadic Power and Cultural Resistance, in which CAE argues that with the creation of the internet the power of the elite has become mobile to the extent that it is difficult for a dissident to directly confront the authority, comparing the untrackable, elusive mobility to that of the Scythians. They demolished the idea that power cannot corrupt and co-opt network and hypertext technologies, that such technologies have a predetermined and manifest destiny of freedom. CAE goes on to observe that occupation theory itself is challenged by cyberspace and the difficulties it presents in terms of focusing a group effort against one authority as opposed to a singular hacker, fiddling with code. An important distinction is made that when rebellious acts are carried out by an individual as opposed to a group in singularity, that the dissenter is seen as a vandal instead of a protester. The article mentions that resistance in the form posters, pamphleteering, street theater and public art have been useful in the past but now that the public is electronically engaged one must bring their resistance methods online.\n\nIn correlation to CAE's work \"Molecular Invasion (2002)\" the collective hosted an exhibit about genetically modified crops. They planted Monsanto's genetically modified seeds that were designed to be immune to Monsanto's commercial pesticide roundup (Glyphosate). They successfully grew these crops in their exhibit however once the plants were fully grown they applied an enzyme inhibitor that was reverse engineered to the plants that eradicated the protection that these crops had against the pesticide. The plants quickly died. This exhibit was a statement against genetically modified foods.\n\nIn 1999, CAE began a new project to draw attention to the ways in which scientific discourses surrounding biotechnologies drew upon promissory religious rhetoric. This participatory performance was titled \"Cult of the New Eve\" (or CoNE when abbreviated) and included a \"communion\" using a random library of the entire genome of the first female donor to the Human Genome Project taken from a blood sample. CAE spliced the genome and inserted it into yeast, which was then placed into host wafers and beer given to audience members who were willing to participate. The genome from the donor is intended to represent a 'New Eve… a sacrosant Messiah'. The project also offers public and online preaching, baptisms, communion, sacred theological and cosmological texts and prophecies.\n\nCAE created a performance titled \"GenTerra\" which raised issues surrounding ethics and safety in performative science. This was done through an investigation into creating transgenic life forms and seeing the consequences of potentially releasing them into the environment. It was the audience members who had to decide whether the bacteria was harmful or not in a game of 'genetic Russian roulette'. Triscott states through her own experience of participating in the performance that members of the audience were given the opportunity to grow and store their own bacteria, with full instructions and guidance. With the aid of a spinning machine, bacteria were spun with only one of ten chambers holding active bacteria. The purpose of \"GenTerrra\" is to 'introduce bioproducts to the audience, and demonstrate the practical applications of such research, such as disease treatment and xenotransplantation'. As CAE wear lab-coats and appear as professional scientists, they simulate actual biotechnology corporations, emphasizing their intentions even further.\n\nCAE attributes the collective's longevity to their structure which has contributed to positive attitudes throughout the group. The number of members, ranging from three to eight and known as a 'cellular structure' has managed to be sustained without members feeling alienated. As each member has the opportunity to show off their individual strengths and weaknesses, the risk of conflict and mistrust is reduced. They do not believe in equality; rather that every member has 'a voice in the production process [of a project]; however the member with the greatest expertise in the area has authority over the final product'.\n\nCAE has also stated that amateurs have the ability to see through dominant paradigms, are more free to recombine elements of paradigms thought long dead, and can apply everyday life experience to their deliberations. Most important, however, amateurs are not invested in institutional systems of knowledge production and policy construction, and hence do not have irresistible forces guiding the outcome of their process…'.\n\n'Since 2006, CAE has changed the focus of its work towards a critique of US defense policy, and has moved away from its interrogation of biotechnology'.\n\nIn 2004, one of its founders, Steve Kurtz, was arrested on suspicion of bioterrorism. On the morning of 11 May 2004, he woke to find that his wife Hope had died in her sleep. He called 911. Police became suspicious after noticing his biology lab which he kept in his own home. They contacted the FBI and Kurtz was detained for 24 hours before being interrogated and his house searched for biohazardous materials. The house was given the all clear, yet a week later, Kurtz's CAE collaborators were ordered to appear before a grand jury to investigate possible violations of the law regarding biological weapons. The jury met in July 2004 and cleared Kurtz of all \"bioterrorism\" charges, however the FBI continued to press charges against the artist and the case dragged on for four years. The case was widely covered in the US and international press, and sparked outrage among artists and scientists worldwide. A website was created for people to donate money to help Kurtz pay his mounting legal fees. The case was dismissed in 2008. -- CAE DEFENSE FUND -- According to Nicola Triscott, the FBI 'thought they had a situation out of which they could manufacture a terrorism case, which potentially brought great personal rewards', based upon the 'Lackawanna Six Sleeper Cell' case where six Yemeni Americans were convicted of supporting al-Qaeda\n\nCritical Art Ensemble is the recipient of awards, including the 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of Artistic Expression Grant UB Art Professor \"Strange Culture\" Case Goes to Court | WBFO, the 2004 John Lansdown Award for Multimedia , and the 2004 Leonardo New Horizons Award for Innovation.

{"id": "23002805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23002805", "title": "Drug lord", "text": "Drug lord\n\nA drug lord, drug baron, kingpin, or narcotrafficker is a high ranking crime boss who controls a sizable network of people involved in the illegal drug trade. Such figures are often difficult to bring to justice, as they are normally not directly in possession of something illegal, but are insulated from the actual trade in drugs by several layers of underlings. The prosecution of drug lords is therefore usually the result of carefully planned infiltration into their networks, often using informants from within the organization.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Guzmán is the most significant drug lord in history. He is well known for his use of sophisticated tunnels—similar to the one located in Douglas, Arizona—to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into the United States in the early 1990s. In 1993, a 7.3-ton shipment of his cocaine, concealed in cans of chili peppers and destined for the United States, was seized in Tecate, Baja California. That same year he barely escaped an ambush by the Tijuana Cartel led by Ramon Arellano Felix and his gunmen. After being captured in Guatemala, he was jailed in 1993 and in 1995 he was moved to the maximum-security prison called Puente Grande, but paid his way out of prison and hid in a laundry van as it drove through the gates. On 22 February 2014, Guzmán was arrested again. \nHe is considered a folk hero in the narcotics world, celebrated by musicians who write and perform \"narcocorridos\" (drug ballads) extolling his exploits. For example, Los Traviezos recorded a ballad extolling his life on the run. In July 2015, Guzman escaped a second time from a maximum-security prison through a hole in a shower floor that led to a mile-long tunnel, ending at a nearby house. A large-scale manhunt ensued. On 8 January 2016, Guzmán was captured by the Mexican Marines.\n\nJorge Alberto Rodríguez, also known as Don Cholito, is a notorious Colombian-Puerto Rican drug lord from the Bronx, New York, who headed The 400 criminal organization, a dismantled secret cell of the Cali Cartel. Pulled into the drug trade at age 12, he left home at age 14 to begin working for his father, Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, who headed the Cali Cartel. Within six years he had made hundreds of millions by shipping drugs from Colombia to nearly every U.S. state. He was one of the most-ruthless international drug lords unknown to law enforcement or governments. During that time, the nation's murder rate and cocaine-related hospital emergencies doubled. He was arrested in 1990 in Tallahassee, Florida and sentenced to a 25-year prison term for a number of federal violations. Following his conviction, Rodriguez continued to operate his illicit business from behind bars, importing as much as into the U.S. every month and ordering numerous murders of informants, witnesses, and law-enforcement officials in the U.S. and Colombia. He reigned and flourished while incarcerated until he was placed in court-ordered high-security isolation in 1994.\n\nPablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (December 1, 1949 – December 2, 1993) was a Colombian drug overlord. Often referred to as the \"World's Greatest Outlaw\", Escobar was perhaps the most elusive cocaine trafficker to have ever existed. In 1989 \"Forbes\" magazine declared Escobar as the seventh-richest man in the world, with an estimated personal fortune of US$25 billion. In 1986, he attempted to enter Colombian politics. It is said that Pablo Escobar once burnt two million dollars in cash to keep warm while on the run.\n\nGriselda Blanco (1943–2012), known as the \"Godmother of Cocaine\", was a drug lord who operated between Miami and Colombia during the 1970s and 1980s. During the height of her operation, she smuggled nearly of cocaine into the U.S. every month through a network in south Florida. She was noted for her ruthlessness and use of extreme violence, employing tactics such as publicly assassinating people in broad daylight, bayoneting a rival trafficker inside Miami International Airport, and inventing the drive-by motorcycle shooting execution method. It was estimated that she was responsible for the homicides of 200 people in Colombia, Florida, New York, and California. Arrested in 1985 for drug-trafficking charges, she was subsequently convicted and spent almost 20 years in a U.S. prison. She was killed by motorcycle hitmen in Colombia on 3 September 2012 as she was coming out of a butcher's shop.\n\nPablo Escobar started to buy cocaine from Roberto Suárez in the 1970s when he had just created the Medellín cartel. Suárez started building cocaine laboratories in the middle of the Bolivian Amazon jungle and in the zone of \"Los Yungas\" in the end of the 1960s and created the first cocaine cartel in Bolivia called \"La Corporación\". At first, the Medellin cartel bought cocaine at $8,000 per kilogram ($3,600/lb). La Corporación then sold cocaine-based paste to Colombian cartels, and they finished and distributed it in the east of the United States. The finished cocaine was sold directly to Mexican cartels for distribution in the west of the United States. Suárez received untold amounts of money, but as detectives and journalists discovered the corruption between Bolivia and the U.S., the empire Suárez built began to fall. Suárez was arrested by the DEA in 1988, and Escobar took over of the production and distribution of 80% of the world's cocaine.\n\nRick Ross (born January 28, 1960), \"Freeway\" Ricky Ross, is a convicted drug-trafficker best known for the drug empire he presided over in Los Angeles in the early 1980s. The nickname \"Freeway\" came from Ross growing up next to the 110 Harbor Freeway. During the height of his drug dealing, Ross was said to have made \"$2 million in one day.\" According to the \"Oakland Tribune\", \"In the course of his rise, prosecutors estimate that Ross transported several tons of cocaine to New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, and made more than $600 million in the process.\"\n\nIn 1998, Ross was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of purchasing more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent during a sting operation. Ross became the subject of controversy later that year when a series of articles by journalist Gary Webb in the \"San Jose Mercury News\" revealed a connection between Ross's main cocaine source, Danilo Blandon, and the CIA as part of the Iran–Contra affair. Ross's case went before the federal court of appeals and his sentence was reduced to 20 years. He was later moved to a halfway house in March 2009 and released from custody on September 29, 2009.\n\nIn June 2014, Ross released his book, \"Freeway Rick Ross: The Untold Autobiography\", co-written by crime-writer Cathy Scott.\n\nFor more than a decade, Panamanian Manuel Noriega was a highly paid CIA asset and collaborator, despite knowledge by U.S. drug authorities as early as 1971 that the general was heavily involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. Noriega facilitated \"guns-for-drugs\" flights for the Nicaraguan Contras, whom the U.S. were heavily supporting: providing protection and pilots, safe havens for drug cartel officials, and discreet banking facilities. He was arrested in 1990.\n\nAs the top drug-trafficker in Mexico, Amado Carrillo (1956–1997) was transporting four times more cocaine to the U.S. than any other trafficker, building a fortune of over $25 billion. He was called El Señor de Los Cielos (\"The Lord of the Skies\") for his use of over 22 private 727 jet airliners to transport Colombian cocaine to municipal airports and dirt airstrips around Mexico, including Juárez. In the months before his death, the DEA described Carrillo as the most-powerful drug trafficker of his era, and many analysts claimed profits neared $25 billion, making him one of the world's wealthiest men.\n\nArellano Félix was a Mexican drug trafficker linked to the Tijuana drug cartel (a.k.a. the Arellano-Félix Organization). Arellano Félix was allegedly one of the most ruthless members of the cartel and was a suspect in various murders. He had been linked by Mexican police to the 1997 massacre of twelve members of a family outside of Ensenada, Baja California. The family was related to a drug dealer that had an unpaid debt to the Arellano Félix Cartel. On September 18, 1997, Arellano Félix was placed on the FBI's ten most-wanted list. In a sealed indictment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, he was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and marijuana.\n\nIsmael Zambada García is a drug smuggler in Mexico. Mexico's top anti-drug prosecutor, José Santiago Vasconcelos, called Zambada \"drug dealer No. 1\" and said the fugitive has become more powerful as his fellow kingpins have fallen, including one who was allegedly killed on Zambada's orders.\n\nKlaas Bruinsma (1953–1991) was a major Dutch drug lord, shot to death by mafia member and former police officer Martin Hoogland. Bruinsma was known as \"De Lange\" (\"the tall one\") and as \"De Dominee\" (\"the preacher\") because of his black clothing and his habit of lecturing others.\n\nMarcos Arturo Beltrán Leyva (September 27, 1961 – December 16, 2009) was the leader of the Mexican drug-trafficking organization known as the Beltrán-Leyva Cartel, which is headed by the Beltrán Leyva brothers: Marcos Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo and Héctor. The cartel was engaged in cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine production, transportation, and wholesaling. It controlled numerous drug-trafficking corridors into the U.S. and was also responsible for human smuggling, money laundering, extortion, kidnapping, murder, contract killing, torture, gun-running, and other acts of violence in Mexico. The organization was connected with the assassinations of numerous Mexican law-enforcement officials.\n\nFrank Lucas is a former heroin dealer and organized crime boss who operated in Harlem, New York during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was known for cutting out middlemen in the drug trade and buying heroin directly from his source in the Golden Triangle. Lucas boasted that he smuggled heroin using the coffins of dead American servicemen, but this claim is denied by his South Asian associate, Leslie \"Ike\" Atkinson. His career was dramatized in the 2007 feature film \"American Gangster\" starring Denzel Washington.\n\nLeroy Antonio \"Nicky\" Barnes (born October 15, 1933) is a former drug lord and crime boss of the notorious African-American crime organization known as The Council, which controlled the heroin trade in Harlem, New York during the 1970s. In 2007 he released a book, \"Mr Untouchable\", written with Tom Folsom, and a documentary DVD of the same name, about his life. In the 2007 film \"American Gangster\", Barnes is portrayed by Cuba Gooding, Jr.\n\nZhenli Ye Gon (traditional Chinese: 葉真理; born January 31, 1963, Shanghai, People's Republic of China) is a Mexican businessman of Chinese origin accused of trafficking pseudoephedrine into Mexico from Asia. At the time of his arrest, he had $207 million cash and 18 million Mexican pesos in his house. He claimed that he was forced by Javier Lozano Alarcón, putatively identified as the Secretary of Labor, to keep it at his home and that this money would be used during Felipe Calderón's presidential campaign in 2006. He is the legal representative of Unimed Pharm Chem México. The charges against him were dismissed with prejudice in August 2009 as a result of the efforts of his attorneys, Manuel J. Retureta and A. Eduardo Balarezo.\n\nMichael Christopher Coke (born 13 March 1969), a.k.a. Dudus, is a Jamaican drug lord and the leader of the Shower Posse gang. He is the youngest son of drug lord Lester Lloyd Coke whose extradition had also, prior to his 1992 death in a Jamaican prison cell, been requested by the U.S. Until the younger Coke's handover to U.S. forces on 24 June 2010, \"Dudus\" served as the \"de facto\" leader of Tivoli Gardens in the city of Kingston; prior to his 2010 capture Jamaican police were unable to enter this neighborhood without community consent.\n\nThe son of a prominent drug lord, Coke grew up wealthy, going to school with children of the country's political elite. Ruling the gang where his father left off, he became a leader in the community of Tivoli Gardens, distributing money to the area's poor, creating employment, and setting up community centers.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. began requesting his extradition, and in May 2010, a recalcitrant Government of Jamaica issued a warrant. That same month the government took steps to capture Coke. In a run-up to Coke's arrest, more than 70 people–all but one of them civilians–died in a 24 May 2010 raid of Tivoli Gardens. He was arrested at a Jamaican checkpoint on 22 June 2010.\n\nDemetrius Flenory is known as one of the co-founders of the Black Mafia Family, a Detroit-based drug-trafficking organization involving the large-scale distribution of cocaine throughout the U.S. from 1990 to 2005. There are currently plans to produce a film based upon his career.\n\nFollowing the death of Pablo Escobar in 1993, significant changes occurred in the structure or drug trade, departing from massive cartels such as Juan David Ochoa's Medellín cartel. Drug lords have begun breaking the large cartels into much smaller organizations. In so doing, they decreased the number of people involved and shrank their role as targets—most likely in an attempt to avoid the fate of their predecessors. With newer technology, drug lords are able to manage their operations more effectively from behind the scenes, keeping themselves out of the spotlight and off the FBI and DEA wanted lists. These smaller cartels are slowly proving to be safer and more profitable for those involved.\n\nUp until the demise of Pablo Escobar, in many instances, drug lords essentially ran the governments of the locations they controlled through bribery and assassination. However, this way of controlling their operations is becoming less prevalent. One of the most-notorious examples of the treatment given to drug lords is in the incarceration of Escobar. Although Escobar was, after turning himself in, jailed for his participation in drug trafficking in Colombia, the \"jail\" in which he was captive was a million-dollar palace built with his own funds. Another famous crime lord who enjoyed lightened jail life was Al Capone, who continued to run his business from his jail cell, which contained tables, chairs, a bed, flowers, and paintings. For drug lords of the past, jail often served as a way to avoid further persecution.\n\nIn recent times, drug lords seldomly control local and regional governments, having less influence over their surroundings and their ability to continue to run their businesses from jail.\n\nAnother trend that has been emerging in the last decade is a willingness of local authorities to cooperate with foreign nations, most notably the U.S., in an effort to apprehend and incarcerate drug lords. Recently, especially in the last five years, countries have been more willing to extradite their drug lords to face charges in other countries, an act that not only benefits them directly but also gives them favor with foreign governments. Mexico extradited 63 drug dealers to the U.S. in 2006. However, extradition may be prohibited if the person faces the death penalty.\n\n\n"}

He is known for defrauding Nelson Sakaguchi, a Director at Brazil's Banco Noroeste based in São Paulo, of $242 million, $191 million in cash and the remainder in the form of outstanding interest, between 1995 and 1998. His accomplices were Emmanuel Ofolue, Nzeribe Okoli, and Obum Osakwe, along with the husband and wife duo, Christian Ikechukwu Anajemba and Amaka Anajemba, with Christian later being assassinated. After Nick Leeson's trading losses at Barings Bank, and the looting of the Iraqi Central Bank by Qusay Hussein, the crime was the third largest in banking history. After a large-scale attack on a town in Nigeria in August 2016, Nwude was alleged to be a ringleader and was arrested on murder charges. He remains in custody.\n\nNwude impersonated Paul Ogwuma, then Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, and successfully convinced Sakaguchi to \"invest\" in a new airport in the nation's capital, Abuja, in exchange for a $10 million commission. In August 1997, the Spanish Banco Santander wanted to take over the Banco Noroeste Brazil. The fraud was uncovered after a December 1997 joint board meeting, in which an official from Santander inquired about why a large sum of money, two-fifths of Noroeste's total value and half of their capital, was sitting in the Cayman Islands unmonitored. This led to criminal investigations in Brazil, Britain, Nigeria, Switzerland, and the United States. To guarantee the sale to Santander, the Simonsen and Cochrane families, the owners of Banco Noroeste, paid the $242 million bill themselves. However, Banco Noroeste collapsed in 2001.\n\nAt the request of Olusegun Obasanjo, President of Nigeria, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was created by the Nigerian Parliament in 2002. In February 2004, Amaka Anajemba, Emmanuel Nwude, Emmanuel Ofolue, Nzeribe Okoli, and Obum Osakwe, with Christian Anajemba deceased at this point, were all arrested and charged in the Abuja High Court with 86 counts of \"fraudulently seeking advance fees\" and 15 counts of bribery related to the case. They pleaded not guilty. They were immediately warned off of bribing the court staff by Abuja High Court Judge Lawal Gumi, after he alleged that money was going around. The defense team assured that \"nothing would be done to bring scandal to the administration of justice.\" Four Nigerian companies, Fynbaz, Emrus, Ocean Marketing and the African Shelter Bureau also faced charges and pleaded not guilty. In July 2004, Judge Lawal Gumi threw out the case, claiming that since the crime did not take place in Abuja, he had no jurisdiction, and said that the proper place for the case would be the Lagos High Court. The defendants were immediately rearrested after stepping outside the courthouse and the case was moved to Lagos. In 2005, Nwudel attempted to bribe Nuhu Ribadu, then head of the commission, with $75,000 cash. He was charged in connection with the attempted bribery in addition to the attempted kidnapping of a prosecution witness. In July 2005, Amaka Anajemba admitted to helping Anajemba and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison and ordered to repay $25.5 million. \n\nDuring Nwude's trial, there was a bomb scare that caused the courthouse to be evacuated. Emmanuel Nwude and Nzeribe Okoli pleaded guilty after testimony from Sakaguchi in hopes of a more lenient sentence, and were sentenced to 29 years in prison collectively, with Nwude receiving five concurrent sentences of five years, totaling 25, and Okoli receiving four. The entirety of Nwude's assets were confiscated to be returned to the victim and a $10 million fine was imposed to be paid to the Nigerian federal government. It was the first major conviction for the EFCC. He was released from prison in 2006.\n\nNwude filed a lawsuit to recover his seized assets after he was released from prison, on the grounds that some of the assets were acquired before the offense was committed. He has already reclaimed at least $52 Million. As of May 8, 2015, the matter is being heard by the Lagos Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn August 19, 2016, the town of Ukpo in the Dunukofia area was attacked by over 200 people, apparently due to a land dispute with the neighboring Abagana community. Four policemen were shot, and Emmanuel Okafor, a security guard at a construction site, was killed. The Anambra State Police Command alleged that Emmanuel Nwude was a ringleader, and arrested him on 27 charges including murder, attempted murder, and terrorist attacks. His case has been adjourned until January 16, 2017. He is currently being held at Akwa Prison in Anambra State, where there is fear of a jailbreak due to Nwude's wealth and status.\n\n"}

There he became a wealthy entrepreneur, helping in the development of hospitals and medical centres, and in sports projects, including the Ice Palace ice skating rink in Tehran.\n\nIn 1979, after the Iranian Revolution, he was sent to Evin Prison. Following his release in 1982, he moved to the United States.\n\nHe married Lucile, a Belgian, and they had four children: Ardeshir, Babak, Camila, and Lila, who committed suicide while he was imprisoned.

He advanced this position in a guest editorial in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology in 1983.\n\nIn 1992, he authored \"Your Body's Many Cries for Water\". In this book, Batmanghelidj asserts that chronic dehydration is the root cause of most pain and many ailments, opposing the use of drugs to cure conditions that he claimed could instead be addressed by increased water consumption.\n\nHe has claimed elsewhere that water provides energy for the body and brain, by splitting into its component hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nBatmanghelidj's ideas about water curing all diseases have been criticized as quackery by medical experts. He also drew criticism for his HIV/AIDS denialism. Physician Harriet Hall has described Batmanghelidj as a \"crank who believed dehydration is the main cause of disease. He promoted his Water Cure, which was not based on any scientific evidence.\"\n\nHis ideas have been criticized by Stephen Barrett, co-founder of the National Council Against Health Fraud and the webmaster of Quackwatch, on several grounds, including a lack of any documented peer-reviewed research and exaggerated claims about the number of patients treated successfully. He further questions that Batmanghelidj has practiced medicine in the United States, pointing to his lack of registration as a physician. He was licensed as a naturopath.\n\n\n"}

Before being captured by the French, he was struck eight times on the head with a sabre, the wounds being prominent for the rest of his life. After return to England, he became involved in a millennialist movement and came to believe that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ would be advanced if he himself were killed by the British government. He therefore resolved, in conspiracy with Bannister Truelock, to attempt the assassination of the King and bring about his own judicial execution.\n\nOn the evening of 15 May 1800, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, during the playing of the national anthem, Hadfield fired a pistol at the King standing in the royal box but missed. Hadfield was tried for high treason and was defended by Thomas Erskine, the leading barrister of that era. Hadfield pleaded insanity but the standard of the day for a successful plea was that the defendant must be \"lost to all sense … incapable of forming a judgement upon the consequences of the act which he is about to do\". Hadfield's planning of the shooting appeared to contradict such a claim. Due to the 1795 Treason Act, there was little distinction between plotting treason and actually committing treason, thus Erskine chose to challenge the insanity test, instead contending that delusion \"unaccompanied by frenzy or raving madness [was] the true character of insanity\". Two surgeons and a physician testified that the delusions were the consequence of his earlier head injuries. The judge, Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon, at this point halted the trial declaring that the verdict \"was clearly an acquittal\" but \"the prisoner, for his own sake, and for the sake of society at large, must not be discharged\".\n\nUp to that time, defendants acquitted by reason of insanity had faced no certain fate and had often been released back to the safe-keeping of their families. Parliament speedily passed the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 to provide for the indefinite detention of insane defendants (and the Treason Act 1800 to make it easier to prosecute people for attempts on the life of the king). Hadfield later inspired further use of pleading insanity several years later during the case of Colonel Edward Despard. Hadfield was detained in Bethlem Royal Hospital for the rest of his life, save for a short period when he escaped. He was recaptured at Dover attempting to flee to France and was briefly held at Newgate Prison before being transferred to the new insane asylum Bethlehem Hospital (or Bedlam, as it was known). He died there of tuberculosis in 1841. \n\nHadfield's story is depicted in the BBC TV period legal drama series in episode 1 of the third series of \"Garrow's Law\", in which William Garrow is portrayed as his barrister - however several changes were made from the generally accepted historical facts.\n\n"}

There were 14 Remonstrants who were summoned, in effect as defendants. There were also some observers, who had no voting status.\nListings are usually given according to a traditional ordering for the provinces that begins with Gelderland; for the provincial synods Holland was divided into two, North and South. In the sources both Latinised names and spelling variants occur. Lists of those nominated to participate in some capacity differ from those who signed the final Acts of the Synod. Figures vary a little, but one total given is for 102 official participants. The outcome of the Synod was the most significant single event in the Calvinist-Arminian debate.\n\nThe Dutch members of the Synod were divided up by provincial synods (for the clerics and elders as delegates), or by provinces (for the lay members). Allowing for Holland as exception, the delegates were divided into ten \"colleges\": one for each of seven provinces, plus Drenthe; one for theological faculties; and one for the Walloon churches.\n\n\nThe commissioners by province were:\n\nOf these Gregorius, van Honaert, Krombout, and Ysbrands were doctors of both laws. The list of commissioners later signing the Acts of the Synod is somewhat different.\n\nA number of prominent Remonstrant ministers were cited to appear before the Synod, around 10% of the 200 identified Remonstrants at that time in the Dutch Reformed Church. Of those, a number were deprived of their church posts before the proceedings, which formed the latter part of the political and religious struggle that had been triggered in 1618, and which came to a head after the Synod closed. Only three Remonstrants were among the delegates (from Utrecht, two ministers and a church elder). Simon Episcopius emerged as leader of the group of Remonstrants who were summoned. His efforts to secure participation in the debates of the Synod for the group failed after extensive procedural discussion; the summoned Remonstrants were, however, required to remain in Dordrecht. With one exception they refused to subscribe to the required declaration at the end of the Synod, were expelled from the Church, and banished. In total around 70 Remonstrant ministers were banished in the aftermath of the Synod.\n\nThe 14 Remonstrants banished by the Synod were:\n\n\n(These are the Latinised names as given, correcting two spellings.) Apart from the Utrecht representative ministers who were Remonstrants–Frederici and Naeranus–these clergy were therefore not full participants in the Synod at any point.\n\nA baseline list of 13 names in \"Historie der Remonstranten\" (1774) by Jacobus Regenboog is of those Remonstrants who were summoned (and omitting the delegates Frederici and Naeranus from the Utrecht provincial synod):\n\n\nIt was Henricus Leo who was the sole Remonstrant of these summoned who signed the Act of Cessation (\"acte van stilstand\") as required by the Synod, and escaped banishment. His absence from the first list gives numbers that tally.\n\nThere is a longer listing in the works of John Hales of those Remonstrants who were cited by the Synod (21 names, but 20 if Joannes Arnoldi and Corvinus are duplicates); this list includes names of ministers who were by other means removed from their posts. The breakdown by provinces is:\n\n\nGoulartius (Simon Goulart the Younger of Geneva, 1575–1628) the Remonstrant was the son of Simon Goulart of Senlis (1543–1628). Though summoned he had already been dismissed from his post.\n\nThere were 27 delegates who attended from outside the Dutch provinces. Two replacements were made during the Synod.\n\nThere was some consideration given to invitations to clergy from Reformed churches in the German principalities and cities of the Empire, with a view to being selective and distinguishing among types of nominally Calvinist church. Invitations were issued to: the Palatinate, Brandenburg, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, East Friesland, Hanau. Anhalt was excluded. John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg declined to send a delegation; the Calvinist–Lutheran relationship in Brandenburg was fragile, and a diplomatic excuse was made. It was later alleged that Anhalt was not invited, for fear that the delegation would be pro-Remonstrant.\n\nFrom France: None because the French government prohibited their attendance. A set of empty chairs was set up in the assembly in honor of the absent French Huguenots. Four delegates had been chosen by the National Synod: Daniel Chamier, Jean Chauve, Pierre Du Moulin and André Rivet.\n\n"}

{"id": "317497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317497", "title": "Lloyd L. Gaines", "text": "Lloyd L. Gaines\n\nLloyd Lionel Gaines (1911, Water Valley, Mississippi – disappeared March 19, 1939, Chicago) was the plaintiff in \"Gaines v. Canada\" (1938), one of the most important court cases in the U.S. civil rights movement in the 1930s. After being denied admission to the University of Missouri School of Law because he was black and refusing the university's offer to pay for him to attend another neighboring state's law school with no racial restriction, he filed suit. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled in his favor, holding that the separate but equal doctrine required that Missouri either admit him or set up a separate law school for Black students.\n\nThe Missouri General Assembly chose the latter option, converting a former cosmetology school in St. Louis to the Lincoln University School of Law, to which other, mostly black, students were admitted. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which had supported Gaines' suit, planned to file another suit challenging the adequacy of the new law school. While he waited for classes to begin, Gaines traveled between St. Louis, Kansas City and Chicago looking for work, doing odd jobs and giving speeches before local NAACP chapters. One night in Chicago he left the fraternity house where he was staying to buy stamps and never returned.\n\nGaines' disappearance was not noted immediately, since he would frequently travel on his own for long periods of time without informing anyone. Only in the autumn of that year, when the NAACP's lawyers were unable to locate him to take depositions for a rehearing in state court, did a serious search begin. It failed, and the suit was dismissed. While most of his family believed at the time that he had been murdered in retaliation for his legal victory, there has been some speculation that Gaines had tired of his role in the civil rights movement and simply went elsewhere, either New York or Mexico City, to start a new life. In 2007 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agreed to look into the case, among many other unsolved missing persons cases related to the civil rights era.\n\nDespite his unknown fate, Gaines has been honored by the University of Missouri School of Law and the state. The Black Culture Center at the University of Missouri and a law scholarship at the law school are named for him and another black student initially denied admission, and in 2006 he was granted an honorary law degree. The state bar association followed with a posthumous law license. A portrait of Gaines hangs in the University of Missouri law school building.\n\nBorn in 1911 in Water Valley, Mississippi, Gaines moved with his mother and siblings to St. Louis in 1926 after the death of his father, settling in the city's Central West End neighborhood. He did well academically, and was a valedictorian at Vashon High School. After winning a $250 ($ in modern dollars) scholarship in an essay contest, he went to college and graduated with honors from Lincoln University in Jefferson City, the state's undergraduate institution for African Americans, with a bachelor's degree in history. He made up the difference between the scholarship and the college's tuition by selling magazines on the street. He was president of the senior class and a brother in the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. \n\nIn 1936, he applied for admission to the law school at the University of Missouri, encouraged by Lorenzo Greene, a Lincoln University professor at the time and veteran civil rights activist. Accounts vary as to whether Gaines did this purely on his own initiative or was encouraged by the NAACP simply to have a plaintiff, without any real interest of his own in attending law school. When St. Louis lawyer Sidney Redmond, one of the three dozen African Americans then admitted to the Missouri bar, informed Charles Hamilton Houston, who was leading the NAACP's legal effort against the segregationist Jim Crow laws, that Gaines was willing to be a plaintiff, Houston at first asked him whether he could find someone else. Houston later yielded when it was apparent Gaines was the only available plaintiff, but never explained what his initial objections might have been.\n\nThe law school's registrar, Sy Woodson Canada, had denied Gaines' admission on racial grounds although he was otherwise qualified for admission to the law school. The official policy of the State of Missouri was to pay the \"out of state\" expenses for education of African Americans who wished to study law until such time as demand was sufficient to build a separate law school within the State of Missouri for them. Gaines and his lawyers argued that lawyers educated out of state lost the benefit of courses that were specific to Missouri law, and the connections and firsthand experience of the state's courts an in-state legal education would offer.\n\nGaines and his lawyers were not hoping to overturn the \"separate but equal\" standard set out by the Court's 1896 \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" decision allowing legal racial segregation, but to subtly undermine it by holding states that did segregate along racial lines to the \"equal\" part of the doctrine. They targeted graduate and professional public institutions of higher learning, which, unlike most other segregated facilities, were few in number and under centralized state control. Once segregationist states realized they had a choice between expensive duplication of such institutions for a small group of African Americans and integration of their existing facilities, they would choose the latter and voluntarily integrate. Houston also believed that since such schools served small portions of the population, attempts to integrate them would arouse less public opposition than efforts to integrate elementary and secondary schools would. Lastly, judges had themselves been educated in them and could better understand the impact of inequalities on students.\n\nThey were encouraged by a 1936 case, \"University of Maryland v. Murray\", in which Houston and Thurgood Marshall had persuaded the Maryland Court of Appeals, that state's highest court, that the University of Maryland could not meet its constitutional burden of equal treatment by offering to reimburse him for tuition out of state instead of allowing him to attend the university, which as an African American he was barred by the university's administration from doing. In Missouri Gaines was likely as well to be offered reimbursement for his out-of-state tuition; however, the racial bar to attendance took the form of a state law instead of an administrative regulation. They hoped to get the Supreme Court to hear the case and establish a precedent.\n\nHouston, Redmond and Gaines left St. Louis before dawn one summer day that year to drive to Columbia for the trial at Boone County courthouse. They arrived as the courthouse was beginning to open for the morning. Due to that summer's severe drought, many of the white farmers in the surrounding communities were there, waiting to make applications for relief. Some went into the courtroom to take in the unusual sight of African American lawyers arguing a case.\n\nThey were joined by one hundred current University of Missouri law students, reporters, and a few local African Americans. Two recent lynchings had discouraged most of the local black community from attending, despite efforts to the contrary by the local NAACP chapters. They sat among the whites, since none of the courtroom facilities were segregated. Even the lawyers for both sides shared a table, and shook hands before the case.\n\nBy the time trial was to begin, the heat outside had already exceeded . The crowds and poor ventilation made it even hotter in the courtroom, and Judge W.M. Dinwiddie suggested that he and the lawyers conduct proceedings with their jackets off. Houston claimed Gaines' exclusion from the law school solely on racial grounds violated his constitutional rights. For the state, William Hogsett conceded that Gaines was an excellent and qualified student with a right to a legal education, as long as it was somewhere other than the law school, since it was public policy of the state, codified in the constitution and laws enacted by its legislature elected by the people, that African American students not be allowed to attend Missouri law school.\n\nGaines testified on his own behalf, and various state and university officials for their side. They claimed that admitting African Americans, the only applicants specifically barred regardless of other qualifications, would be \"an unhappy thing\" for both them and other students. William Masterson, dean of the University of Missouri School of Law, claimed not to know details of the admissions process or the school's budget on cross-examination.\n\nHogsett presented his case for the audience, some of whom nodded in sympathy with his arguments, while Houston concentrated on getting facts in the record for the appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the only venue where he expected and wanted to prevail. He never seriously expected to win at trial, and indeed two weeks later Dinwiddie decided the case for the state. The judge did not write an opinion explaining his holding, and Gaines appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court.\n\nThe state's highest court heard the arguments near the end of the year. While normally it sat in two divisions, the case was considered so important that all seven justices were present. Two months later, it upheld Judge Dinwiddie. Justice William Francis Frank reiterated the court's earlier holdings for segregation, that it was to the advantage of blacks as well as whites. In Gaines's case, he held that the separate but equal standard was satisfied by the availability of an out-of-state legal education at state expense. \"Equality is not identity of privileges,\" he wrote.\n\nHouston and Redmond successfully petitioned to the United States Supreme Court for \"certiorari\". Now known as \"Gaines v. Canada\", the case was argued on November 9, 1938. Houston said the state's offer to pay for Gaines to attend law school out of state could not guarantee him a legal education equal to that offered white students.\n\nA month later a 6-2 majority ordered the State of Missouri either to admit Gaines to the University of Missouri School of Law or to provide another school of equal stature within the state borders. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote for the majority:\nThe case articulated an important rule of law in the sequence of NAACP cases leading to the eventual desegregation order: that any academic program that a state provided to whites had to have an equivalent available to blacks. The \"Gaines\" holding helped lay the foundation for the landmark 1954 ruling in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", which ordered all public schools desegregated and overturned \"Plessy\" by holding that separate facilities were inherently unequal.\n\nSince the Supreme Court had ordered the Missouri Supreme Court to rehear the case in light of its ruling, Gaines' legal battle was not over. Historian Gary Lavergne describes Gaines during this period as \"high-maintenance\". He sought out media attention, then complained about how stressful it was being the center of attention. Heman Marion Sweatt, later the plaintiff in another desegregation case heard by the Supreme Court, worked with Gaines at the University of Michigan, where the NAACP had paid for him to attend graduate school in the meantime, and reportedly found him \"rather arrogant.\"\n\nAfter working as a clerk for the Works Progress Administration in Michigan and completing a master's degree in economics, Gaines returned to Missouri in anticipation of the proceedings there, set to begin in August. The Missouri legislature hastily passed a bill appropriating $275,000 ($ in modern dollars) to convert an old beauty school in St. Louis into the new Lincoln University School of Law, in the hope that would satisfy the court. The NAACP planned to challenge the establishment of the new law school as still inadequate compared to the resources of the existing University of Missouri School of Law. Gaines, who would still need to pay his law school tuition as well as his daily living expenses, looked for work in the meantime. Between the continuing Depression and segregation, he had to settle for work at a gas station. He gave speeches to local NAACP chapters and church groups for donations, telling them \"I am ready, willing and able to enroll in the law department at the University of Missouri in September, and I have the fullest intention of doing so,\" but still had to borrow money from his brother George for everyday expenses.\n\nGaines quit the job at the gas station when he discovered the owner was purposely mislabeling low-grade fuel as high-grade, fearing he might be caught up in the legal consequences should the fraud be discovered. After taking a train across the state to Kansas City to give a speech to the local NAACP chapter and look, unsuccessfully, for work, he boarded another train for Chicago. There he reunited with the Page family, friends and neighbors from his youth in the Central West End, and stayed at a local YMCA.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Gaines looked for work and visited with the Pages. While he maintained at public appearances that he was determined to continue his court case until its end and to attend the University of Missouri School of Law, in private he was becoming increasingly ambivalent. His mother said that he had decided not to go, as they both believed it was \"too dangerous.\" Nancy Page later recalled asking Gaines directly about this. \"His answer wasn't straightforward, and if I remember correctly, he said something like this: 'If I don't go, I will have at least made it possible for some other boy or girl to go.'\"\n\nIn his last letter to his mother, dated March 3, he expressed similar sentiments:\n\nGaines had begun the letter by telling her that he had come to Chicago \"hoping to find it possible to make my own way\" and ended it, \"Should I forget to write for a time, don't worry about it. I can look after myself OK\".\n\nGaines also wrote that his accommodations at the YMCA were paid through March 7 and if he stayed in Chicago beyond that date, he would have to make \"other arrangements.\" After that, brothers at an Alpha Phi Alpha house took him in. He continued to have dinner at the Pages' home.\n\nNancy Page said that Gaines had told her he'd taken a job at a department store. A reporter later found that although he had been hired, he never reported for what would have been his first day of work. In the last days that she had contact with Gaines, Page said he seemed \"to be running away from something.\" Gaines's family members and descendants believe he -and possibly the family as a whole- had received death threats, and given their background in rural Mississippi, they would have been too fearful to report the threats to the police.\n\nGaines's financial woes continued so the Alpha Phi Alpha brothers took up a collection for him. Gaines promised the Pages that he would repay their generosity by taking them out to dinner on the night of March 19 but he never got the chance to do so. Earlier that evening, Gaines told the house attendant that he was going out to buy stamps although the weather was cold and wet. Gaines never returned and no one ever reported seeing him again. His ultimate fate remains unknown.\n\nGaines left behind a duffel bag filled with dirty clothing at the fraternity house when he disappeared. Since he had had a history of leaving for days at a time with little or no notice to his friends and family, and often kept to himself, his absence seemed unremarkable at first. No report was made to the police in either Chicago or St. Louis.\n\nHis disappearance finally became an issue several months later. In August, Houston and Sidney Redmond went looking for him as they began to argue his case at the Missouri Supreme Court's rehearing. They could not locate him, and Redmond recalled that the Gaines family was neither concerned nor very helpful in trying to do so. The Lincoln University School of Law in St. Louis opened in late September to pickets denouncing it as a segregationist sham. While 30 students who had been admitted since it was created showed up, Gaines was not among them. Since only Gaines had been denied admission to the University of Missouri School of Law, only he had standing to pursue the case before the Supreme Court of Missouri, and the case could not proceed without him.\n\nNear the end of the year the NAACP began a frantic effort to find him. There were rumors that he had been killed or committed suicide, along with rumors that he had been paid off to disappear and was either living in Mexico City or teaching school in New York. The story received widespread media attention, and his picture was published in newspapers across the country with a plea for anyone with information to contact the NAACP. No credible leads were received. In his 1948 memoirs, NAACP president Walter White said, \"He has been variously reported in Mexico, apparently supplied with ample funds, and in other parts of North America.\"\n\nGary Lavergne notes that Houston, Marshall and Redmond never publicly called for an investigation of the disappearance or stated that they believed Gaines had met with foul play. Since extrajudicial abductions and murders of African Americans who challenged segregation were not unheard of at the time, and the three lawyers frequently spoke out and demanded investigations when they believed they had occurred, he thinks that they had no such evidence and believed that the erratic Gaines, whom they knew to have grown resentful of the NAACP and his role in the lawsuit, had purposely dropped out of sight. Fifty years later, near the end of his own career as a Supreme Court justice, Marshall recalled the case in terms that suggest this assessment: \"The sonofabitch just never contacted us again.\"\n\nIn January 1940, the state of Missouri moved to dismiss the case due to the absence of the plaintiff. Houston and Redmond did not oppose the motion, and it was granted.\n\nNo law enforcement agency of the era formally investigated Gaines's disappearance. It had not been reported to any of them, and many African Americans distrusted the police. J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who took a very suspicious view of the civil rights movement, wrote in an internal memo in 1940 that he did not believe the case fell under the FBI's jurisdiction.\n\nWith the onset of World War II, other concerns displaced the Gaines case for most of the 1940s. The only other official record relating to the case released by the FBI was a 1970 letter from Hoover to an unidentified member of the public, thanking them for their interest in the case but reiterating his position from 30 years earlier that he did not believe the FBI had any jurisdiction to investigate. Two media outlets looked into the case a half-century apart, \"Ebony\" in the 1950s and \"The Riverfront Times\" in the 2000s.\n\n\"Ebony\" reporter Edward T. Clayton revisited Gaines and his disappearance in 1951. It has been described as the most thorough investigation of the case. Clayton retraced Gaines's movements in the months between the Supreme Court ruling and his trip to Chicago. Many who knew Gaines were still alive, such as his family in St. Louis and fraternity brothers in Chicago, and he interviewed them.\n\nHe found little new information, but was able to draw a fuller portrait of Gaines that revealed the young man's disillusionment with his activist path. Callie Gaines, bedridden in her attic, shared her last conversation with him in which both of them realized that he wouldn't actually be following through and enrolling in the University of Missouri School of Law. She said that he had sent her a final postcard saying, \"Goodbye. If you don't hear from me anymore you know I'll be all right.\" She had heard all the rumors about him turning up in Mexico or New York. \"But nobody knows any more than we do.\" One of his sisters believed he was still alive. The family has never sought to have him declared legally dead.\n\nGaines's brother George, who had kept loaning Lloyd spending money at that time, said that at the time of his disappearance Lloyd had owed him $500. He was particularly bitter about the NAACP for, in his opinion, exploiting Lloyd. \"That organization—the N-A-A-C-P or whatever it was—had him going around here making speeches,\" Gaines told Clayton, \"but when he got ready to go to Kansas City, I had to let him have $10 so he could get himself a white shirt.\" Sidney Redmond agreed that the Gaines family \"doesn't seem too much concerned—and never was as I recall\" about finding him due to their resentment of the civil rights' organization's role in pushing Lloyd Gaines into the public eye without adequately providing for or protecting him.\n\nGeorge Gaines did, however, provide Clayton with Gaines's letters home, including the last one, almost two weeks before he disappeared. In it, Gaines again laments the insufficient support he received from his fellow African Americans and wishes he were just a regular, unknown person again. It, like the postcard, concludes with a suggestion that he may be out of touch for a while. All of them have since been digitized and are currently online at the University of Missouri's digital archives.\n\nIn Chicago, Clayton talked to the Alpha Phi Alpha brothers among whom Gaines had spent his last known days and the Pages, his family friends from St. Louis. The former could offer little beyond pinning down the precise date of his disappearance and the duffel bag of dirty laundry he left behind. Two who claimed Gaines had sent them postcards from Mexico were unable to corroborate their accounts with the actual postcards.\n\nThe Pages shared the details of Gaines's increasingly anxious state of mind in March 1939. Nancy Page did not inquire closely, out of respect for his privacy, but could tell something was bothering him. She reported a conversation with Gaines in which he was at best ambivalent about continuing the legal case and attending the University of Missouri School of Law. From her Clayton found out about the job Gaines had accepted, and found through his own research that Gaines had never actually started work there.\n\nSt Louis' alternative weekly newspaper, \"The Riverfront Times\", revisited the case in 2007, well over 60 years after his disappearance. By that time Gaines had received honors (some described as posthumous) and the FBI had accepted the case as the oldest of nearly one hundred civil-rights era disappearances referred to it by the NAACP. His immediate family and all others who had worked or socialized with him during that time were dead. Reporter Chad Garrison spoke with George Gaines, a nephew of Lloyd's who was one of only two surviving family members who had been alive when Lloyd disappeared, although he had only been an infant at the time, and other, younger descendants.\n\nGeorge Gaines said his family had rarely spoken of Lloyd during his childhood in the 1940s, but when they did it was usually in highly positive terms. \"Lloyd was always held in high regard as a person who set a positive example and stood up for what was right\", he recalled. He had assumed that his uncle had died, and only when he read the \"Ebony\" article did he learn that Lloyd's true fate was unknown.\n\nWhile Garrison mostly reiterated Clayton's reporting, finding no new facts about the disappearance itself or Gaines's time in Chicago, he found more direct evidence that Gaines might indeed have fled to Mexico and lived out his life there. Sid Reedy, a University City librarian who had been an Alpha Phi Alpha brother at Lincoln University as well, told Garrison that after becoming fascinated by the case in the late 1970s, he had sought out Lorenzo Greene, Gaines's mentor at Lincoln University and an esteemed civil rights activist and intellectual. Greene told Reedy that while on a visit to Mexico City in the late 1940s he had made contact with Lloyd Gaines.\n\nGreene, who died in 1988, claimed to have spoken on the telephone with Gaines, whose voice he recognized instantly, several times. The two made plans to have dinner together, but Gaines did not show up. Greene told Reedy that Gaines had indeed \"grown tired of the fight ... He had some business in Mexico City and apparently did well financially.\"\n\nGarrison reported that Greene's son, Lorenzo Thomas Greene, said his father had also told him of the encounter. He said the older man always hoped Gaines would return. But because of his experience with the FBI while active in the civil-rights movement during those years, he did not report it. \"There wasn't a lot of trust there,\" said the son. \"Even if my father went to them with that information, I really don't think they would have cared.\"\n\nSome of Gaines's relatives were willing to accept that he lived out his life in Mexico, as opposed to the alternative scenarios. \"It's better than being buried in a basement somewhere—Jimmy Hoffa style,\" said Paulette Mosby-Smith, one of Gaines's great-nieces. Others believe that would have been against his nature. \"It's hard for me to believe that he went to Mexico and accepted a big payoff,\" George Gaines told Garrison. \"That's not the same man who presented himself during the trial. I don't believe he would compromise his integrity like that.\" Another great-niece, Tracy Berry, who went to law school herself and became a federal prosecutor, agrees:\n\nShe has since told \"The New York Times\" that she believes her great-uncle was murdered.\n\nAlthough they had never had Lloyd Gaines declared legally dead, the family nevertheless erected a monument to him in a Missouri cemetery in 1999. \"His legacy didn't so much make me want to go to law school,\" says Tracy Berry. \"But I think he did instill the legacy of education in our family. It's expected that you go to college. He started the fight that made it all possible.\" The \"Louisville Defender\", that city's African American newspaper, expressed similar sentiments in a December 1939 editorial: \"[W]hether Gaines has been bribed, intimidated or worse, should certainly have little permanent effect on the struggle for equal rights and social justice in connection with Negro education in the South ... [where] Negroes are already hammering upon the doors of graduate schools hitherto closed to them, with increasing persistence.\"\n\n\"I remember the \"Gaines\" case as one of our greatest legal victories,\" said Thurgood Marshall, who argued \"Brown v. Board of Education\" before the Supreme Court and was later that body's first African American justice. \"But I have never lost the pain of having so many people spend so much time and money on him, just to have him disappear.\"\n\nEven without having forced the issue at the Missouri Supreme Court, and without challenging the separate but equal doctrine, \"Gaines\" \"[made] constitutional compliance in the absence of integration difficult to achieve,\" according to historian Gary Lavergne. He cited three aspects of the decision:\n\nNAACP lawyer Charles Hamilton Houston had hoped that the effect of similar court rulings that gave segregationist states a choice between full integration or duplication of programs for students of different races would lead many of them to choose the less expensive former option. But without Gaines, he could not carry through the next stage of his plan in the Missouri Supreme Court.\n\nIn the short term the abrupt dismissal of the case forced by Gaines's disappearance was a setback for all efforts to legally challenge segregation. The NAACP's resources were depleted after having spent $25,000 ($ in modern dollars) on the case. New plaintiffs, already difficult to find in the depressed economy, couldn't be supported by the organization. Lincoln University School of Law, the only tangible result of the case, was closed by the mid-1950s due to lack of students. When World War II, which had already begun in Europe, swept in the United States two years later, the civil-rights struggle was suspended for the duration.\n\nHouston, ill with the tuberculosis that would end his life a decade later, resigned from the NAACP to return to private practice. Marshall took over for him, a change of personnel that ultimately benefited the desegregation legal effort after the war, when the organization found more plaintiffs and challenged segregationist policies in public graduate schools with cases like \"Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.\", \"Sweatt v. Painter\" and \"McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents\". The University of Missouri School of Law, bowing to pressure from the student body, finally admitted its first African American student in 1951. Three years later the desegregation effort climaxed with \"Brown\", overturning \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" and the separate but equal doctrine forever.\n\nIn the years after \"Brown\", when desegregation became a reality but tensions over it persisted, Gaines's story became a cautionary tale at the University of Missouri. In a 2004 paper, LeeAnn Whites, a professor of Civil War history at the school, repeated a version of it in which Gaines had been on his way to enroll at the school as an undergraduate and had disappeared from a train traveling across the state, with the implication that he was murdered. Gerald M. Boyd, a St. Louis native and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the \"New York Times\" who was one of a few hundred black students at the University of Missouri in the early 1970s, recalls hearing Gaines's story early in his time there, when he was confronted by open displays of racial prejudice such as the university's \"Confederate Rock\". \"Whatever his fate\", he wrote in his memoirs, \"in the eyes of blacks, the university bore the brunt of the blame.\" \nThe University of Missouri, and particularly the University of Missouri School of Law, began recognizing Gaines near the end of the 20th century, despite his never having been formally admitted as a student. It began with a scholarship in his name in 1995. In 2001, the school's African American center was named for Gaines and another early African American who challenged the school's color bar in court. A portrait of Gaines also hangs in a prominent public place in the law school building.\n\nThose honors were supplemented in 2006 when the law school awarded him an honorary degree in Law. The Supreme Court of Missouri, which had denied Gaines's admission almost 70 years before, and the state bar association granted him an honorary posthumous law license. It has been suggested that if Gaines were still alive (he would have turned 95 in 2006) and reappeared, those awards would allow him to practice law in the State of Missouri.\n\n\n\n"}

First taking up singing in a church choir, she quit her job when she was 19 years old to pursue a career as a vocalist. Beginning with support from other established musicians, M'Pongo eventually began writing her own compositions, often utilising feminist themes.\n\nAimee Françoise M'Pongo Langu was born on 27 August 1956 in Boma, Belgian Congo, the second daughter in a family of seven children. Her father, Gilbert Pongo, was a soldier, while her mother was the director of a girls' education center. At the age of four M'Pongo contracted polio and was paralysed by a shot of penicillin. She crawled until she was trained to use a prosthesis in 1962, allowing her to walk. As a child, M'Pongo attended a church where her father was a cantor and began singing for the choir.\n\nM'Pongo also sang in her secondary school choir and, when she graduated, she moved to Kinshasa and enrolled in a shorthand typing course. Afterwards she took a job as an executive secretary at a firm. When she wasn't working she looked for show-business contracts, introducing herself as M'Pongo Love, a name her parents had reportedly used for her since her childhood.\n\nIn December 1975 when she was 19 years of age, M'Pongo met saxophonist Empompo Loway, who resolved to help her develop a singing career and persuaded her to leave her secretary job. After an initial failure to secure M'Pongo patronage, the two met band manager Ngwango Isionoma, who agreed to supply them with money to start her career.\n\nLoway assisted her in forming a band, Tcheke Tcheke Love, and composed her first songs. M'Pongo debuted with the song \"Pas possible Maty\" and soon thereafter delivered her first concert at the Ciné Palladium in Kinshasa. Throughout 1977 she performed with an additional backing group, Les Ya tupa’s (with members such as Ray Lema, Félix Manuaku Waku, and Alfred Nzimbi), singing compositions by Mayaula Mayoni, Simaro Lutumba, and Souzy Kaseya. Her rendition of Mayaula's \"Ndaya\" became a hit success in Kinshasa, especially among local women.\n\nM'Pongo soon began composing and arranging her own music. In 1980 she ended her professional relationship with Empompo to work independently, subsequently moving to Paris. She later produced music under her own label, \"Love’s Music\". Later in life she contracted cerebral meningitis in Gabon. She was at her home in Binza, Kinshasa, planning to make a career comeback when her condition worsened and in December 1989 she was admitted to a local clinic. Her older brother told the media that she had suffered a \"strong attack\", not specifying her illness. She died on 15 January 1990 and was survived by three daughters.\n\nM'Pongo sang in a clear, slightly nasal voice and utilised precise intonations. During her performances she braced herself on the sides of the stage to compensate for her physical disability. Compared to her contemporaries, M'Pongo was the most feminist of all women soukous singers and actively criticised polygamy and the practice of keeping mistresses in her music. In a 1989 interview she explained her feminist views:I sing about women's problems, I try to give them courage...and I will stop singing when the relations between men and women in Africa become problem free. But what African man doesn't have a mistress? In addition to a hard life, women have a lot to endure. I have a feminist duty to see they fight, that they defend themselves, that they hold their heads high, that they take independent women as examples...We must know how to say what we are, we African women, without fearing all the modernism we need to assimilate.\n\n\n"}

Zatko, better known as Mudge, is a network security expert, open source programmer, writer, and a hacker. He was the most prominent member of the high-profile hacker think tank the L0pht as well as the long-lived computer and culture hacking cooperative the Cult of the Dead Cow.\n\nWhile involved with the L0pht, Mudge contributed significantly to disclosure and education on information and security vulnerabilities. In addition to pioneering buffer overflow work, the security advisories he released contained early examples of flaws in the following areas: code injection, race condition, side-channel attack, exploitation of embedded systems, and cryptanalysis of commercial systems. He was the original author of the password cracking software L0phtCrack.\n\nIn 2010 Mudge accepted a position as a program manager at DARPA where he oversaw cyber security research. In 2013 Mudge went to work for Google in their Advanced Technology & Projects division.\n\nBorn in December 1970, Mudge graduated from the Berklee College of Music at the top of his class and is an adept guitar player.\n\nMudge was responsible for early research into a type of security vulnerability known as the buffer overflow. In 1995 he published \"How to Write Buffer Overflows\", one of the first papers on the topic. He published some of the first security advisories and research demonstrating early vulnerabilities in Unix such as code injection, side-channel attacks, and information leaks, and was a leader in the full disclosure movement. He was the initial author of security tools L0phtCrack, AntiSniff, and l0phtwatch.\n\nMudge was one of the first people from the hacker community to reach out and build relationships with government and industry. In demand as a public speaker, he spoke at hacker conferences such as DEF CON and academic conferences such as USENIX. Mudge has also been a member of Cult of the Dead Cow since 1996.\n\nHe was one of the seven L0pht members who testified before a Senate committee in 1998 about the serious vulnerabilities of the Internet at that time. The L0pht became the computer security consultancy @stake in 1999, and Mudge became the vice president of research and development and later chief scientist.\n\nIn 2000, after the first crippling Internet distributed denial-of-service attacks, he was invited to meet with President Bill Clinton at a security summit alongside cabinet members and industry executives.\n\nIn 2004 he became a division scientist at government contractor BBN Technologies, where he originally worked in the 1990s, and also joined the technical advisory board of NFR Security. In 2010, it was announced that he would be project manager of a DARPA project focused on directing research in cyber security. In 2013 he announced that he would leave DARPA for a position at Google ATAP. In 2015 Zatko announced on Twitter he would join a project called #CyberUL, a testing organisation for computer security inspired by Underwriters Laboratories, mandated by the White House.\n\nOn 11 August 2007 he married Sarah Lieberman, a co-worker at BBN.\n\nAt DARPA he created the Cyber Analytical Framework the agency used to evaluate DoD investments in offensive and defensive cyber security. During his tenure he ran at least three DoD programs known as Military Networking Protocol (MNP), Cyber-Insider Threat (CINDER), and Cyber Fast Track (CFT).\n\nMilitary Networking Protocol (MNP) provided network prioritization with full user-level attribution for military computer networks.\n\nCyber-Insider Threat (CINDER) focused on identifying cyber espionage conducted by virtual insider threats such as future variants of Stuxnet or Duqu. CINDER is often mistakenly associated with WikiLeaks in the media. This is possibly due to the confusion between DARPA programs focused on identifying human insider threat such as ADAMS and the identification of software espionage posed by malware in the CINDER program. This issue was clarified by Mudge in his Defcon 2011 keynote at 46 minutes and 11 seconds into the talk.\n\nCyber Fast Track (CFT) provided resources and funding to security research, including programs run by hackers, hackerspaces, and makerlabs. The program provided an alternative to traditional government contracting vehicles that was accessible to individuals and small companies previously unable to work within the cumbersome and complicated DARPA process. The novel contracting effort had an averaging time of 7 days from receipt of proposal to funding being provided to the proposing research organization. The program was initially announced at Shmoocon during his 2011 keynote.\n\n\n\nMudge published numerous papers and advisories detailing security problems across different applications and operating systems and was a pioneering champion of full disclosure.\n\n"}

He is known for his role in filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court of India against the Chief Minister of the Government of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, concerning Modi's alleged role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. He falsely claimed to have attended a meeting, during which Modi allegedly asked top police officials to let Hindus vent out their anger against the Muslims. However, the Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India concluded that Bhatt did not attend this meeting, and dismissed his allegations.\n\nIn 2015, Bhatt was removed from the police service, on the ground of \"unauthorised absence\". In October 2015, the Supreme Court quashed Bhatt's plea for constituting a special investigation team (SIT) for cases filed against him by Gujarat Government. The court lifted a stay on his trial in these cases and asked him to face prosecution. The court observed that, \"Bhatt was in active touch with leaders of rival political party, was being tutored by NGOs, was involved in politics and activism of creating pressure, even upon 3-judge bench of this court, amicus and many others\".\n\nSanjiv Bhatt is a Gujarati. He earned an M. Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 1985. He is married to Shweta Bhatt.\n\nBhatt joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 1988, and was allotted the Gujarat cadre. In 1990, as the Additional Superintendent of Police, he detained 150 people in order to control a riot in Jamnagar district. Prabhudas Vaishnani, one of the detainees, died of kidney failure a few days later, after being hospitalised. His brother lodged an FIR against Bhatt and six other policemen, alleging that he had been tortured in police custody. Another man, Vijaysinh Bhatti, alleged that he had been beaten up by Bhatt.\n\nIn 1996, as the Superintendent of Police (SP) of Banaskantha district, he was accused of falsely framing a Rajasthan-based lawyer in a narcotics case. It was alleged that Bhatt maliciously filed nearly 40 petitions in the high courts of Rajasthan and Gujarat as well as before the apex court to delay action against him. The Bar association members have alleged that Bhatt got himself appointed the Gujarat government's officer in-charge for the special appeal petition pending in the SC. They pointed out that Bhatt is using the Gujarat government as a shield to save himself but is also misusing the public money to fight the crimes he committed.\n\nHe was accused in another custodial torture case in 1998.\n\nFrom December 1999 to September 2002, he worked as Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence in the State Intelligence Bureau at Gandhinagar. He was responsible for looking after the state's internal security, border and coastal security, and security of vital installations. He was also responsible for the Chief Minister Narendra Modi's security. During this period, the Godhra train burning and the subsequent Hindu-Muslim riots led to over a thousand deaths in February-March 2002.\n\nOn 9 September 2002, Narendra Modi allegedly mocked the high Muslim birth rates during a speech at Bahucharaji. Though Modi denied making such remarks, the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) sought a report from the State Government. Modi's Principal Secretary P K Mishra told \"The Indian Express\" that the State Government had no recordings or transcripts of the speech, and therefore, could not send these to the NCM. However, the State Intelligence Bureau provided the NCM a copy of Modi's speech, which had been recorded as part of routine procedure. Subsequently, the Modi government transferred the Bureau's senior officials on 'punishment postings'. The officers transferred included Sanjiv Bhatt, R. B. Sreekumar and E. Radhakrishnan. Bhatt was posted as principal of the State Reserve Police Training College.\n\nIn 2003, Bhatt was posted as the superintendent of Sabarmati central jail. There, he became very popular among the prisoners. He introduced desserts like gajar ka halwa on the jail menu. He also posted undertrials in Godhra train burning case on a jail committee. Two months after his appointment, he was transferred for being too friendly with the prisoners and bestowing favours upon them. On 18 November 2003, nearly half of the 4000 prisoners went on a hunger strike to protest his transfer. Six convicts slashed their wrists in protest.\n\nBy 2007, Bhatt's colleagues from the 1988 batch had been promoted to the rank of Inspector-general of police (IGP). However, Bhatt had stayed at the SP level for a decade without any promotion, because of the pending criminal cases and departmental inquiries against him.\n\nAfter the 2002 riots, a group of social activists had formed the \"Concerned Citizens Tribunal\" to analyze the riots. Gujarat's home minister Haren Pandya allegedly told this tribunal that Modi had organised a meeting at the Chief Minister's residence on 27 February 2002, after the Godhra train burning, in which over 50 Hindu pilgrims died. According to Pandya, in this meeting, Modi had asked the police officials not to come in the way of \"the Hindu backlash\". Pandya had named a number of police officials who attended this meeting; Bhatt was not among these. Pandya was later assassinated by unidentified men.\n\nOn 14 April 2011, 9 years after the riots, Bhatt filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court of India, making similar allegations. According to Bhatt, at this meeting on 27 February 2002, Modi asked top police officials to let Hindus \"vent out their anger\" against the Muslims. He said that the meeting determined to bring the bodies of the Hindu pilgrims to Ahmedabad prior to cremation, and that he had cautioned against this, fearing religious violence. According to him, Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Hindu nationalist Bajarang Dal were stirring tensions in the city, and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had proposed a bandh (an illegal general strike). Bhatt claimed that the then Director General of Police, K. Chakravarthi, and the city Police Commissioner, P. C. Pandey, had raised concerns regarding the manpower available to deal with this, and both men advised that it was not wise for the bodies to be taken to Ahmedabad. Bhatt also says that he sent some fax messages to major officials soon after the meeting ended and that these referred to the meeting itself, the decision regarding the bodies of the dead and the growing activity of the BJP and Bajrang Dal. Subsequently, riots occurred in which around 1000 people died, three-quarters of whom were Muslim. Described as a whistleblower both by some of the Indian media and some pressure groups, Bhatt has since referred to the events as \"state-sponsored riots\" and has alleged both that Modi told his officials to be \"indifferent\" towards rioters and said that Muslims needed to be \"taught a lesson\".\n\nIn his affidavit, Bhatt mentioned six witnesses, who could testify his presence in the alleged meeting held at Modi's residence. He claimed that he had traveled to Modi's residence in the official car of K. Chakravarthi, which was being driven by Tarachand Yadav; Bhatt's own driver Constable KD Panth followed them in Bhatt's official car. Bhatt's affidavit was signed by KD Panth, whose statement supported Bhatt's presence at the alleged meeting. On 24 June 2011, Panth filed an FIR against Bhatt, alleging that Bhatt had threatened him and forced him to sign a false affidavit. Panth alleged that Bhatt took him to residence of Arjun Modhwadia, the state president of the opposition party, Indian National Congress. He further alleged that Modhwadia asked him to obey Bhatt. Panth claimed that he was on leave in February 2002, when the riots broke out, and had already told this to the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT). Chakravarthi also denied that Bhatt was present in the meeting.\n\nHowever, Tarachand Yadav supported Bhatt, stating that he had driven Bhatt to Modi's bungalow, and that Panth had been with them. He also supported Bhatt's claim that he travelled there with Chakrabarthy.\n\nWhen questioned why he had not made these revelations earlier, Bhatt stated that in 2004, he \"started sending out feelers\" that he wanted to be cross-examined by the Nanavati Commission, but the Commission had not called him. In May 2011, Bhatt repeated the allegations made in his affidavit when he was called to give evidence to the NMC. Prior to this appearance and in order to support the statements that he would make during it, Bhatt had attempted to obtain documents as evidence from the police and the State Intelligence Bureau, as well as from the SIT hearing. He again requested this information in December 2011, claiming that it was needed in order that it could be placed on the official record. These requests for information failed, and Bhatt alleged that this was because the Modi government opposed them because it was involved in a \"cover up\". In 2012, he alleged that the NMC had consistently refused to demand production of the documents, despite Bhatt's belief that it has the legal powers to do so.\n\nBhatt's ex-boss R. B. Sreekumar stated that Bhatt had never told him about his presence at the meeting during these nine years. But he told the Nanavati Commission that in 2002, the Modi government had asked the State Intelligence Bureau to tap Haren Pandya's phone to confirm that he was the minister who talked to the \"Concerned Citizens Tribunal\". \n\nIn March 2008, the Supreme Court had appointed a Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by former Central Bureau of Investigation chief R. K. Raghavan, to investigate cases relating to the various incidents that had occurred during the 2002 riots. One of those who died in the Gulbarg Society massacre that formed a part of the riots was Ehsan Jaffri, the former Indian National Congress Member of Parliament. His widow, Zakia Jaffri, subsequently became concerned about the involvement of senior officials in allegedly aiding and abetting the rioters and by the lack of legal action against them by the police. She petitioned the Court, alleging criminal conspiracy, a \"deliberate and intentional failure\" to protect life and property, and failure to fulfil their constitutional duty. In 2009, the Court responded by directing the SIT to investigate the actions of Modi and 62 other people, including Pandey and some VHP leaders. Bhatt presented evidence to this particular SIT investigation in 2009.\n\nIn his 2011 affidavit, Bhatt accused the SIT of trying to \"hide the truth behind the riots\". Bhatt alleged that a mole in SIT leaked information to the Modi Government, through Gujarat's additional advocate general Tushar Mehta. Mehta and Bhatt were good friends since the 1980s, until 2010. Bhatt claimed that he happened to access Mehta's account to book two vacations for their families: one to Goa in September 2009 and another to the US in May-June 2010. At that time, he claims, he saw emails from SIT in Mehta's inbox. Mehta alleged that their friendship ended because of something that happened during their 2010 vacation in the US; he refused to go into details calling it a personal affair. In August 2011, Mehta lodged a complaint against Bhatt, accusing him of hacking into his email account. Bhatt's wife Shweta denied the accusation, stating that her husband only helped Mehta because the latter was not good with computers.\n\nThe Court had previously appointed Raju Ramachandran to act as \"amicus curiae\" (friend of the court). Ramachandran had reviewed the original confidential SIT report that had been submitted in November 2010. His report was also confidential but prompted the Court to order the SIT to conduct a self-review. That self-review had been submitted in April 2011 and the Court referred this for consideration by Ramachandran in May, which was also when it refused to accept Bhatt's affidavit.\n\nIn June 2011, Bhatt filed a Public-interest litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court, calling for an independent agency to investigate the riots or, alternatively, for the case to be transferred outside Gujarat. Bhatt also alleged that his emails had been hacked and filed a complaint against the state alleging that they had been leaked from the SIT.\n\nOn 13 October 2015, a bench comprising Supreme Court Chief Justice H L Dattu and Justice Arun Mishra ruled Bhatt's allegations against the SIT as totally \"false and baseless\". It further rebuked Bhatt, ruling that \"He had exchanged e-mails with rival political party leaders and was being tutored by the lawyer of an NGO and its activist... The petitioner has even sent e-mails to influence the judicial proceedings of a 3-Judge Bench of this court and has tried to influence the amicus curiae.\"\n\nOn 8 August 2011, the Gujarat government suspended Bhatt, accusing him of unauthorised absence from duty, not appearing before an inquiry committee and using his official car while not on duty.\n\nBhatt claimed that he was unable to report for work because he was required to attend various legal and investigatory hearings, including those of Nanavati-Mehta Commission (NMC) — originally known as the Nanavati-Shah Commission — which had been established by the government of Gujarat.\n\nThe Gujarat government had originally appealed the court to drop charges against Bhatt and other policemen in the 1990 custodial death case. However, after Bhatt's affidavit against Modi, the Government withdrew its application, and the court initiated criminal proceedings against the policemen. On 18 September, the Gujarat Home Ministry chargesheeted Bhatt in the 1990 police atrocity case. On 27 September 2011, Bhatt appeared before the Gujarat High Court in the police atrocity case against him in Jamnagar district. During the hearing, he told the Court that Narendra Modi and his former Home Minister Amit Shah had pressurised him to destroy crucial evidence in the Haren Pandya murder case.\n\nIn a fresh affidavit, Bhatt made detailed allegations against Modi and Shah. He claimed that while posted as Superintendent of the Sabarmati Jail in 2003, he had met Asgar Ali, an accused in the Haren Pandya murder case. Ali allegedly told him that Pandya had been killed by Tulsiram Prajapati (who was later killed in a fake encounter in 2006). Bhatt claimed that he had immediately informed Home Minister Amit Shah about this revelation, but Shah asked him to destroy all documentary evidence related to this matter. He claimed that he had been removed as the Jail Superintendent because he had refused to obey Shah.\n\nOn 30 September 2011, Bhatt was arrested, following an investigation into KD Panth's FIR. Bhatt alleged that Panth was following \"diktats\" from the Modi government, an allegation denied by Panth. Bhatt's arrest was condemned by the Congress leaders and human rights activists, who accused the Modi government of persecuting Bhatt. The arrest gave rise to protests at places such as Ahmedabad, Delhi and Bangalore. The Gujarat IPS Officers Association also expressed their support for Bhatt and his family, although this was far from being unanimous and was downplayed by various senior officers. Bhatt has referred to being harassed by members of the Gujarat police.\n\nOn 17 October 2011, Bhatt was granted bail by a local court in Ahmedabad, on condition that he continue to cooperate with investigations into the allegations laid against him. His bail application had been opposed by the Modi government. The Supreme Court suspended the case in April 2012, with Bhatt arguing that the arrest was \"politically motivated\".\n\nBhatt was among those who refused to accept an award offered by the Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar Academy in 2011. This was because one of the co-awardees, Jagdish Tytler, is alleged to have been involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.\n\nIn November 2012, Bhatt and six other policemen were charged with murder in the 1990 custodial death case of Prabhudas Vaishnani.\n\nA former BBC journalist, Shubhranshu Choudhary, filed an affidavit in November 2011 that supported the claim that Bhatt was present at the 2002 meeting. In the same month, he requested that the SIT allow his testimony to be recorded in the presence of a magistrate as he believed that his earlier statements to it had been distorted. He made several similar requests thereafter.\n\nIn January 2012, the SIT demanded the original copy of the fax messages that Bhatt claimed to have sent after the 2002 meeting and which, according to Bhatt, substantiated his presence at the meeting. Bhatt said that he had already provided the evidence in 2009 and again in 2011. He also noted that the SIT could get the information from the SIB records, and he claimed that the SIT was failing to interview police officials who could testify to his movements on the night in question. This was not the first occasion that he had alleged the SIT was reluctant to examine key witnesses who could verify his whereabouts at the time of the meeting.\n\nBhatt has produced evidence of police inaction to SIT chairman along with a letter which had details of deployment of police, SRP and RAF in the state, areas under curfew, types of crimes committed during the riots, etc. In that letter he also alleged delayed deployment of army. He insisted that those documents were intended for the sole purpose of ensuring that crucial evidence is not disregarded or concealed by the SIT with a view to screen powerful and influential offenders from legal punishment\". Bhatt in a letter written to SIT alleged that the probe team didn’t exhume the bodies from well of Naroday Patia despite strong evidences catered by him to support his claim. He also complained that Ahmedabad police commissioner P. C. Pandey was alerted on the same.\n\nIn February 2012, Bhatt accused the SIT of destroying evidence in collusion with the Gujarat government. Bhatt has once again written to the NMC seeking state intelligence and police records, documents and log books pertaining to Godhra riots as he thought the remaining records too may be destroyed by the Government.\n\nHe also claimed before the panel that Modi was wantonly giving misleading answers and unfortunately the investigation officer didn’t contradict him with all evidences that were available at his disposal.\n\nBhatt suggested in March 2012 that the final report of the NMC should be submitted to the governor of Gujarat rather than to its chief minister, Modi. He also thought that the earlier NMC report, which concerned the Godhra train incident and had been produced in 2008, should be recalled from the chief minister and presented instead to the governor. The basis for his request was that Modi's actions formed a part of the terms of reference of the enquiry and that \"\"no person shall be a judge in his own cause\". He also criticised the earlier report, in which the NMC had exonerated Modi of any wrongdoing in relation to the riots. Bhatt believed that the NMC lacked the official authority to make such a statement. He also criticised the failure of the NMC to summon Modi to appear before it, and a few days later he requested that Modi should be summoned on the basis of an affidavit that had been filed with the Commission by the late Amarsinh Chaudhary, a former Gujarat Chief Minister, in 2002. Bhatt claimed that the affidavit showed that Chaudhary had met with Modi during the period of the riots because he was concerned about reports of events in the Gulbarg Society, including the situation of Ehsan Zafri. According to Bhatt, the affidavit records that Chaudhary had found Modi to be not very \"responsive\" when they met and that he had received reports that the police were not acting as they should during the events.\n\nBhatt had filed a plea before the Supreme Court seeking a special investigative probe into two First Information Reports filed against him by the Gujarat Police. The first FIR was for forcing his official driver, K D Panth, a subordinate officer, to file a false affidavit that he had transported Bhatt on 27 February 2002 to Chief Minister Narendra Modi's residence where Bhatt alleged that Modi had instructed officers to allow riots following the Godhra train carnage. The second FIR was that he had hacked the email of a law enforcement official, namely Tushar Mehta, then additional advocate general of Gujarat. In his plea before the court, Bhatt asserted that both FIRs filed against him were politically motivated and should be probed by a Supreme Court monitored investigative team to uncover abuse of power by the Modi government.\n\nOn 13 October 2015, a bench comprising Chief Justice H L Dattu and Justice Arun Mishra dismissed Bhatt's plea and ordered a speedy trial to be conducted in both cases. It used email evidence to rule that Bhatt had deliberately colluded with leaders of the opposition Congress Party, NGO activists and certain elements in the media to furnish false evidence about his attendance at the 27 February 2002 meeting chaired by Modi so that he could falsely allege that Modi had incited riots.\"The exchange of emails which are self-explanatory indicate that the petitioner was in active touch with leaders of rival political party, NGOs, their lawyers, tried to play media card, and was being tutored by NGOs. The manner in which he acted is apparent from the aforesaid emails and need not be repeated. Petitioner had probably forgotten that he was senior IPS officer,\" the bench said. Referring to his past conduct, the bench said there were three departmental inquiries pending against him and he was also accused of committing atrocities on peaceful and innocent villagers in Jamjodhpur which resulted in the death of one person. The court said Bhatt had also invoked the provisions of TADA during his tenure. Moreover, the Court condemned Bhatt's conduct as underhanded and unbefitting of a senior police officer. \n\nThe Supreme Court on 14th Oct. 2015 cleared the way for criminal prosecution of sacked IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt for allegedly hacking the email account of the then additional advocate general of Gujarat Tushar Mehta and for forcing a junior police official to file a false affidavit in a Gujarat riots case.\n\nBhatt’s allegation on inaction of police officers upon instruction from Modi was also supported by K. S. Subramanian who was a member of fact finding team led by former Supreme Court Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer. His conclusion was the outcome of his interaction with former Gujarat police chief Chakravarthy and P.C. Pandey who was then Ahmedabad police commissioner.\n\nAt a convention marking the tenth anniversary of the Godhra, Bhatt said that he is unable to see any justice for the victims of riots. Bhatt was issued summon by National Commission for Minorities along with other retired and serving police officers of Gujarat to testify the role of Modi to bring out the truth of 27 February 2002 meeting which held at Modi’s home. The summon was issued to Bhatt on the basis of a complaint filed by Niyazbibi Malek,\n\nBhatt contacted Pratibha Patil, the Indian President, in April 2012. He sought a probe against Modi. He has requested the centre to appoint two member commission to enquire the role and conduct of Modi, his officials and police officers in the Godhra massacre. He also demanded an investigation into the government’s measures on the rehabilitation for victims.\n\nThe SIT released all details of its investigations related to the Jaffri complaint of complicity on 7 May 2012, following deposition of its final report with the courts. The release included the two reports of Ramachandran, the \"amicus\", that had been submitted in January and July 2011. The documents revealed that the SIT believed that Bhatt had not been present at the meeting and that this was supported both by statements from those who had been present and by analysis of Bhatt's telephone records, which suggested that he was in Ahmedabad at the time. The SIT also found that the fax message that Bhatt claimed to have sent never existed and he concocted it later and the signatures of his superior officers were forged. Their preliminary report did note that there was a lack of credibility among the witnesses present at the meeting, some of whom had retired and were claiming either a loss of memory or had been in receipt of retirement benefits that might impact upon their neutrality. In addition, the SIT considered Bhatt to be an unreliable witness who had attempted to coach other witnesses, had not provided adequate explanation for his nine-year silence regarding the events surrounding the meeting and had been imprecise in his description of the events. They also though that he had \"an axe to grind\" against the state.\n\nThe Ramachandran reviews painted a different picture. He queried how the SIT could rely on the testimony of witnesses who were present at the meeting when the investigation had itself raised doubts concerning their credibility, and he provided a rationale that could explain Bhatt's presence despite his relatively low rank. He also disputed the SIT conclusions regarding the telephone records analysis and said that the matter of presence needed to be tested in court because the evidence available was insufficient to discount Bhatt's claim. Bhatt had claimed that there were two meetings on the day in question, at different times. Ramachandran's reports also showed that he thought that, if they were true, the alleged statements made by Modi were actionable in law and that the veracity of those allegations should also be tested in court. Ramachandran accepted that Bhatt had not acted in a manner consistent with his official duties but noted that \n\nThere were other differences of opinion between the SIT and Ramachandran but there were also points upon which they agreed. One of these was that the murdered Haren Pandya, who had been the Gujarat Home Minister at the time of the riots but later had a falling out with Modi, could not have been at the meeting and therefore could not have vouched for Bhatt's presence there, as had been claimed by a former judge in February 2012.\n\nShweta Bhatt contested unsuccessfully against Modi in the 2012 state assembly elections.\n\nAfter the official release of the Amicus curiae’s report, \"The Times of India\" described Bhatt as pivot in the case against Modi. Bhatt criticised the published SIT report on the Godhra attack, claiming that the SIT was shielding Modi. Besides his deposition before NCM, Bhatt has filed an affidavit in National Commission of Minorities (NCM).In his affidavit Bhatt has asked the rights panel to initiate action against the SIT headed by R K Raghavan for incorrectly recording his statements or tweaking them to give a clean chit to Chief Minister Narendra Modi.\nHe also alleged that certain very crucial portions of his statement, including the timings of extremely consequential meetings with the chief minister Narendra Modi on 27 February & 28 February 2002, have either been incorrectly recorded or deliberately tweaked by the SIT, possibly with the ulterior motive and intent of shielding certain powerful persons including the chief minister from legal punishment.\n\nConcerns have been raised at various times regarding the personal safety of Bhatt. At the time of filing his Supreme Court affidavit in April 2011, Bhatt requested the Court for protection and the Gujarat government assured the Supreme Court that it would provide personal safety arrangements. This situation had arisen because Bhatt believed that the SIT had passed on his testimony to the state government and thus he feared for the security of himself and his family.\n\nHis wife, Shweta, alleged that there was harassment during the period that he spent in jail under arrest in October 2011. She requested that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) of the Government of India intervene to ensure that both he and his family were protected. The MHA instructed the government of Gujarat accordingly.\n\nBhatt had been provided with two personal guards but considered this to be insufficient. In November 2011 he requested improved security, including provision of a bullet proof car. He repeated his demands in February 2012, when he also raised objections on personal safety grounds to a request from the Gujarat police that he should return his service revolver.\n\nIn November 2013 Bhatt alleged that city police was not providing him adequate security, and there was an increased threat to his and his family members' lives from the \"right-wing fundamentalists and the supporters of Narendra Modi\". Earlier, Bhatt had alleged that his security had been downsized. The office of Commissioner of Police Shivanand Jha said that after the assessment of threat perception, it was decided that Bhatt should be provided with two armed personal security officers. However, Bhatt wrote to the commissioner, saying that he was being \"provided with only one armed PSO\".\n\nBhatt was removed from the IPS on 19 August 2015 on the ground of \"unauthorised absence\".\n\n"}

His parents were Anna Louisa, née de la Hooke (1824–1907) and Alfred William Otter (1815–1866), both English immigrants who married in Ontario on 15 September 1842. He began his military career in the Non-Permanent Active Militia in Toronto in 1864. Captain William Otter was Adjutant of the Queen's Own Rifles of Toronto in 1866. He first saw combat with them at the Battle of Ridgeway during the Fenian Raids.\n\nHe joined the Permanent Force as an infantry officer when Canada established its own professional infantry unit in 1883. On May 2, 1885, he led a Canadian force of more than 300 in the Battle of Cut Knife against Poundmaker's Cree Indians. Otter's tactics were ineffective against the defending warriors, forcing him to retreat.\n\nIn 1890, Otter founded the Royal Canadian Military Institute as a body for \"the promotion and fostering of military art, science and literature in Canada.\" The Gen Sir William Otter Papers are selected from those presented at events organized by the Defence Studies Committee of the Royal Canadian Military Institute.\n\nHe was appointed as the first Commanding Officer of the Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in 1893.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Otter commanded the Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry at the time of the Second Boer War, during which he played an important part in the Battle of Paardeburg. Otter commanded the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion of The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in South Africa, where they were considered by many British officers to be the best infantry battalion in the country. He became the first Canadian-born officer to command Canada's military in 1908, and he retired in 1910 as a full general. Otter had the reputation of being something of a martinet – due mainly to his desire that the young Canadian Army should not show up badly when compared to British troops.\n\nHe wrote \"The Guide: A Manual for the Canadian Militia (Infantry) Embracing the Interior Economy, Duties, Discipline, Drills and Parades, Dress, Books, and Correspondence of a Battalion with Regulations for Marches, Transport & Encampment, Also Forms & Bugle Calls\" in 1914, which includes sections on discipline, courts martial, offences, complaints, and defaulters.\n\nDuring the First World War he came out of retirement to command operations for the internment of enemy nationals resident in Canada.\n\nOtter headed the Otter Commission. The Otter Commission was tasked to establish links of perpetuation from the units of Canadian Expeditionary Force back to the institutionally separate units of the Canadian Militia in the years following the First World War. This establishment of perpetuation, based primarily on geographical connections through original recruiting areas of the CEF battalions, provided a basis by which the achievements and battle honours of the CEF units transferred back to the units of the standing Militia. Without this work of the Otter Commission the CEF and its achievements would have had no continuance with existing units of the Canadian Army today.\n\nGeneral Sir William Otter died on 6 May 1929.\n\nOtter was initiated into the Ionic Lodge of Freemasonry in Toronto in February 1869. He became Worshipful Master in 1873.\n\nOtter Squadron, composed of University Training Plan Non Commissioned Member Officer Cadets, at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, was named in his honour.\n\nOtter was the grandfather of Canadian Military historian Desmond Morton.\n\n\n"}

The watch, called the Titan Edge was introduced in 2002.\n\nAfter Titan's success, Desai founded Tanishq, a jewelry brand.
