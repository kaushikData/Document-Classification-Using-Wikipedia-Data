He is also an essayist, as well as having written poetry, short stories, and books for children.\n\nAyi Kwei Armah was born in the port city of Sekondi-Takoradi in Ghana to Fante-speaking parents, descending on his father's side from a royal family in the Ga nation. From 1953 to 1958 Armah attended the Prince of Wales's College (now better known as Achimota School), and won a scholarship to study in the United States, where he was between 1959 and 1963. He attended Groton School in Groton, MA, and after graduating he entered Harvard University, receiving a degree in sociology. He then moved to Algeria and worked as a translator for the magazine \"Révolution Africaine\". In 1964, he returned to Ghana, where he was a scriptwriter for Ghana Television and later taught English at the Navrongo Secondary School.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1968, he was editor of \"Jeune Afrique\" magazine in Paris. From 1968 to 1970, Armah studied at Columbia University, obtaining his MFA in creative writing. In the 1970s, he worked as a teacher in East Africa, at the College of National Education, Chang'ombe, Tanzania, and at the National University of Lesotho. He subsequently taught at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Cornell University, and at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He has lived in Dakar, Senegal, since the 1980s.\n\nIn the village of Popenguine, about 70 km from Dakar, he established his own publishing house, Per Ankh: the African Publication Collective, through which his own books are now available.\n\nBeginning his career as a writer in the 1960s, Armah published poems and short stories in the Ghanaian magazine \"Okyeame\", and in \"Harper's Magazine\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", and \"New African\". His first novel, \"The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born\", was published in 1968, and tells the story of a nameless man who struggles to reconcile himself with the reality of post-independence Ghana.\n\nIn \"Fragments\" (1970), the protagonist, Baako, is a \"been-to\" - a man who has been to the United States and received his education there. Back in Ghana he is regarded with superstitious awe as a link to the Western lifestyle. Baako's grandmother Naana, a blind-seer, stands in living contact with the ancestors. Under the strain of the unfulfilled expectations Baako finally breaks. As in his first novel, Armah contrasts the two worlds of materialism and moral values, corruption and dreams, two worlds of integrity and social pressure.\n\n\"Why Are We So Blest?\" (1972) was set largely in an American university, and focused on a student, Modin Dofu, who has dropped out of Harvard. Disillusioned Modin is torn between independence and Western values. He meets a Portuguese black African named Solo, who has already suffered a mental breakdown, and a white American girl, Aimée Reitsch. Solo, the rejected writer, keeps a diary, which is the substance of the novel. Aimée's frigidity and devotion to the revolution leads finally to destruction, when Modin is killed in the desert by OAS revolutionaries.\n\nThe trans-Atlantic and African slave trades are the subject of Armah's \"Two Thousand Seasons\" (1973), in which a pluralized communal voice speaks through the history of Africa, its wet and dry seasons, from a period of one thousand years. Arab and European oppressors are portrayed as \"predators,\" \"destroyers,\" and \"zombies\". The novel is written in allegorical tone, and shifts from autobiographical and realistic details to philosophical pondering, prophesying a new age.\n\n\"The Healers\" (1979) mixed fact and fiction about the fall of the Ashanti Empire. The healers in question are traditional medicine practitioners who see fragmentation as the lethal disease of Africa.\n\nArmah remained silent as a novelist for a long period until 1995, when he published \"Osiris Rising\", depicting a radical educational reform group that reinstates ancient Egypt at the centre of its curriculum.\n\nBelonging to the generation of African writers after Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka, Armah has been said to \"epitomize an era of intense despair.\" Armah's later work in particular has evoked strong reaction from many critics. While \"Two Thousand Seasons\" has been called dull and verbose, or the product of a \"philosophy of paranoia, an anti-racist racism – in short, Negritude reborn\" Soyinka has written that Armah's vision \"frees itself of borrowed philosophies in its search for unifying, harmonizing ideal for a distinctive humanity.\"\n\nAs an essayist, Armah has dealt with the identity and predicament of Africa. His main concern is for the creation of a pan-African agency that will embrace all the diverse cultures and languages of the continent. Armah has called for the adoption of Kiswahili as the continental language.\n\nNovels\nFor children\nNon-fiction\n\n\n\n"}

His mother Angiolina Orzali was a seamstress from the town of Collodi from which he took the stage-name and his father, Domenico Lorenzini was a cook and both worked for the Marquis Ginori Lisci. Collodi was the eldest in the family and he had 10 siblings but seven died at a young age. He spent most of his childhood in the town of Collodi where his mother was born. He lived there with his grandmother. After attending primary school, he was sent to study at a seminary called Colle Val d'Elsa. An account explained that Ginori offered financial aid but the boy found that he did not want to be a priest so he continued his education at the College of the Scolopi Fathers in Florence. Two years later, he started working at the bookstore Libreria Piatti, where he assisted Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist.\n\nDuring the Italian wars of Independence in 1848 and 1860 Collodi served as a volunteer with the Tuscan army. His active interest in political matters may be seen in his earliest literary works as well as in the founding of the satirical newspaper \"Il Lampione\" in 1853. This newspaper was censored by order of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1854 he published his second newspaper, \"Lo scaramuccia\" (\"The Controversy\"). Lorenzini's first publications were in his periodicals. A debut came in 1856 with the play \"Gli amici di casa\" and parodic guidebook \"Un romanzo in vapore\", both in 1856. By 1860, he published his first notable work called \"Il signor Alberi ha ragione!\" (Mr. Alberi Is Right!), which outlined his political and cultural vision of Italy. This is the text where Lorenzini started using the Collodi pseudonym, which was taken from his mother's hometown.\n\nCollodi had also begun intense activity on other political newspapers such as \"Il Fanfulla\"; at the same time he was employed by the Censorship Commission for the Theatre. During this period he composed various satirical sketches and stories (sometimes simply by collating earlier articles), including \"Macchiette\" (1880), \"Occhi e nasi\" (1881), \"Storie allegre\" (1887).\n\nCollodi became disenchanted with Italian politics afterward so he turned to children's literature and his first works involved translating French fairy tales into Italian. In 1875, for instance, he completed \"Racconti delle fate\", a translation of French fairy tales by Perrault. In 1876 Lorenzini wrote \"Giannettino\" (inspired by Alessandro Luigi Parravicini's \"Giannetto\"), the \"Minuzzolo\", and \"Il viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino\", a pedagogic series which explored the unification of Italy through the ironic thoughts and actions of the character Giannettino.\n\nLorenzini became fascinated by the idea of using an amiable, rascally character as a means of expressing his own convictions through allegory. In 1880 he began writing \"Storia di un burattino\" (\"Story of a Marionette\"), also called \"Le avventure di Pinocchio\", which was published weekly in \"Il Giornale per i Bambini\", the first Italian newspaper for children. Pinocchio was adapted into a 1940 film by Disney \n\nLorenzini died in Florence in 1890.\n\n"}

Scarver (born July 6, 1969) is an American convicted murderer who is best known for murdering serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer at Columbia Correctional Institution, Portage, Wisconsin, in 1994. Scarver used a 20-inch (51 cm) metal bar he removed from a piece of exercise equipment in the prison weight room to beat Dahmer and another convicted murderer, Jesse Anderson. Both Dahmer and Anderson died later from their injuries. Scarver was sentenced to two further life sentences for the killings. \nScarver is the second of five children and was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He attended James Madison High School before dropping out in the eleventh grade. Eventually his mother forced him to leave the house because of his increasing alcoholism.\n\nScarver was hired as a trainee carpenter in a Wisconsin Conservation Corps job program. He said that he had been promised by Edward Patts, a supervisor, that upon completion of this program he would be hired full-time, but Patts was dismissed, and as a result, Scarver's full-time position never materialized.\n\nOn June 1, 1990, Scarver went to the Wisconsin Conservation Corps training program office and found Steve Lohman, the supervisor who had replaced Edward Patts. Scarver demanded money from Lohman. When Scarver received only $15 from Lohman, Scarver shot Lohman in the head. At the same time, he demanded money from site manager John Feyen. According to authorities, Scarver said, \"Do you think I'm kidding, Mr. Hitler? I need more money.\" Scarver shot Lohman twice more before Feyen was able to run away after giving a $3,000 check to Scarver. \n\nScarver was convicted and sentenced to life in prison and sent to the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin, in 1992. While imprisoned, he complained of experiencing messianic delusions, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n\nOn the morning of November 28, 1994, Scarver was assigned to a work detail with two other inmates, Jesse Anderson and Jeffrey Dahmer, that included cleaning the prison gymnasium toilet. When corrections officers left the three unsupervised, Scarver beat the other two men with a metal bar that he had removed from a piece of exercise equipment in the prison weight room. When he returned to his cell early, an officer asked him why he was not still working. During that time two officers found Dahmer and Anderson. Scarver said that Dahmer had taunted other inmates by constructing \"severed limbs\" out of food and ketchup.\n\nDahmer was pronounced dead while on the way to the hospital, while Anderson died two days later. After being found competent to stand trial, Scarver received two more life sentences for these murders.\n\nIn 2005, Scarver brought a federal civil rights suit against officials of the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility in which he argued that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, contrary to his constitutional rights. Scarver stated that he spent 16 months in solitary confinement as a result of the Dahmer killing. A district court judge dismissed the suit against several of the defendants and ruled that the actions of the remaining officials could not be considered unlawful. Scarver unsuccessfully appealed the decision in 2006. Later, federal district court judge Barbara Crabb ordered that Scarver and about three dozen other seriously mentally ill inmates be relocated from the Wisconsin facility. Scarver was eventually relocated to the Centennial Correctional Facility in Colorado.\n\nIn 2012, an agent representing Scarver announced that Scarver was willing to write a tell-all book about the killing of Dahmer.\n\nIn 2015, Jamie Schram of the \"New York Post\" reported that Scarver had believed that Dahmer was unrepentant for his crimes. Schram reported that Dahmer would taunt fellow inmates by shaping his prison food into severed limbs and drizzling packets of ketchup on them to simulate blood. It also reported that, although Scarver had not interacted with Dahmer before killing him, he knew that Dahmer was very unpopular with fellow inmates and had seen him get into several altercations with other prisoners. Scarver was reported to have said that he was revolted by Dahmer's crimes and that he carried in his pocket a news article detailing the atrocities. Immediately before murdering Dahmer, Scarver allegedly presented the newspaper clipping to him and asked him whether the account was true. Scarver was reported to have said that prison staff left him alone with Dahmer because they wanted Dahmer dead and they knew that Scarver hated him. In a 2015 blog post, however, Scarver disputed some of these statements.\n\n"}

It differs from the flag because this latter uses fesses. It is one of the oldest coats of arms in Europe dating back to a seal of Raymond Berengar IV, Count of Barcelona and Prince of Aragon, from 1150.\n\nToday, this symbol has been adopted and/or included in their arms by several former territories related to the Crown of Aragon, like the arms of Spain, which wears it in its third quarter whereas the kings of Spain are heirs of those of Aragon; the shield of Andorra, which also shows it in its third quarter. It is also the main element of the arms of the present Spanish Autonomous Communities of Catalonia, Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands; the fourth quarter of the Spanish Autonomous Community of Aragon; of the French regions of Languedoc-Roussillon (Department of the Pyrénées-Orientales, whose territory regroups the old province of Roussillon and French Cerdagne); and in the Italian provinces of Reggio de Calabria, Catanzaro in Calabria and Lecce in Apulia. It figures also in numerous located municipal blazons in the territories of the Crown, either by explicit concession of the king, or because they were cities or towns of \"realengo\" (that is, directly dependent on the Crown and subject to no kind of manorialism); and others outside it, in which case the symbol is because of the presence of the king or knights of the Crown at some moment of their local history.\n\nThe blazon of the arms is: \"Or, four pallets of gules\". In heraldry, the escutcheon is commonly known as that of the \"of Aragon\".\n\nThese pallets of gules are commonly named in popular usage and culture as the \"red bars\" or the \"four bars\".\n\nIt has been described on the Middle Ages armorials as in \"Armorial du Hérault Vermandois\", 1285–1300, as that of the King of Aragon, naming specifically Peter III as one of the bearers, is described as \"These are the arms of the Counts of Barcelona who acquired Aragón by marriage (...)\", the one of Count of Barcelona is the same \"or three pallets gules\", the arms of the King of Majorca are those of Aragon, with the coat of arms of James II, King of Majorca being \"or four pallets gules a bend azure\" and the one of the King of Ternacle \"d Aragon et Ternacle en flanquiet lun dedans lautre (...) Per pale or four pallets gules and argent (...)\". The coat of arms with the four red pales on a gold background appears on several other coats of arms, named as \"of Aragon\".\n\nAlso mentioned in Armorial de Gelre, 1370–1395, the coat of arms of Peter IV \"Die Coninc v[on] Arragoen\" is golden with four pallers of gulets or the Armorial d'Urfé, 1380, \"sont les armes de le Conte de Cathalogne\", and in armorial de Charolais, 1425, \"arms conte de Barselongne\" and armorial Le Blanq (sources from 1420–1450) \"venant des contes de Barselone\", armorial Wijnbergen, King of Aragon \"or four pallets gules\"\n\nOriginally it was the familiar emblem of the Kings of Aragon and Counts of Barcelona. In 1137, when Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged by dynastic union by the marriage of Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona and Petronila of Aragon, these titles were finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. Slowly the various entities and territories over which the House of Aragon-Barcelona ruled and came to rule came to be called the Crown of Aragon.\n\n\"The new ruler of the united dynasty (Raymond Berenger IV of Barcelona) called himself count of Barcelona and \"prince\" of Aragón.\"\n\nThe son of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronila, Alfonso II, inherited both the titles of King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona, in a style that would be maintained by all its successors to the crown. Thus, this union was made while respecting the existing institutions and parliaments of both territories.\n\nIt constitutes the third quarter section of the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Spain.\n\nThe oldest \"evidence\" where the arms can be seen is from 1150, in a seal of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The seal evidence is disputed by some Aragonese authors who claim that the first documented evidence dates from the time of Alfonso II (king of Aragon and count of Barcelona) reign\n\nAs a pre-heraldic symbol, the \"red bars\" on a yellow background are found on the Romanesque tombs of Barcelona's Count Ramon Berenguer II Cap d'estopes, who died in 1082, and his great-grandmother Ermessenda, who died in 1058, wife of Count Ramon Borrell I, both of whose tombs were at the portico of the old Romanesque Cathedral of Girona; it is not sure that the 15 bars of gold appearing in a painting are contemporary to the tombs. It is a proof that relates the arms to the Counts of Barcelona lineage and the pre-heraldic forms indicate pre-heraldic times, before the second Third of the 12th century.\n\nThe exact origin of the \"four bars\" symbol is obscure, and for long it has been explained by legends, now proven false. The first undisputed evidences are from the Alfonso II (king of Aragon and count of Barcelona) reign.\n\nEven though a purely Aragonese origin for the \"four bars\" symbol has been proposed, the main point held by Aragonese authors (Fatás, Ubieto, Montaner), partially supported by some Catalan historians like Ferran de Segarra, is that the key evidence for the Catalan origin, the Marseilles seals, is dubious. The lines in the monochrome Marseilles seals are interpreted as mere scratchings by some, and as representation of a shield reinforcement by others. This theory was rejected by Aragonese member of the International Heraldry Academy Faustino Menéndez-Pidal.\n\nA second point put forward by Aragonese authors is that Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona was the \"de facto\" ruler of Aragon, even if only his son Alfonso II would become \"de jure\" king of Aragon. Therefore, any symbol associated with Ramon Berenguer IV can also be attributed to the then budding Crown of Aragon.\n\nThe autonomous communities of Aragon, Balearic Islands, Catalonia and the Valencian Community together with some cities such as Barcelona, also include these arms.\n\n\n\n"}

Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center office in Jerusalem, is the coordinator of Nazi war crimes research worldwide for the Wiesenthal Center and the author of its annual \"Status Report\" on the worldwide investigation and prosecution of Nazi war criminals which includes a list of \"most wanted\" Nazi war criminals. \nBorn in New York City, Zuroff moved to Israel in 1970 after completing his undergraduate degree in history (with honors) at Yeshiva University and high school studies at Yeshiva University High School for Boys. He obtained an M.A. degree in Holocaust studies at the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University, where he also completed his Ph.D., which chronicles the response of Orthodox Jewry in the United States to the Holocaust and focuses on the rescue attempts launched by the Vaad ha-Hatzala rescue committee established by American Orthodox rabbis in 1939.\n\nIn 2000, Yeshiva University Press and KTAV Publishing House published his study of the history of the Vaad ha-Hatzala, which was awarded an Egit Grant for Holocaust and Jewish Resistance Literature by the Israeli General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) and also received the 1999-2000 Samuel Belkin Literary Award for the best book published by a Yeshiva University alumnus in the field of Jewish studies.\n\nIn 1978, he was invited to be the first director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, where he played a leading role in establishing the Center’s library and archives and was historical advisor for the Center’s Academy award-winning documentary \"Genocide\". He returned to Israel in 1980, where he served as a researcher for the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Special Investigations. His efforts assisted in the preparation of cases against numerous Nazi war criminals living in the United States.\n\nHe rejoined the Wiesenthal Center in 1986 and uncovered the postwar escape of hundreds of Nazi war criminals to Australia, Canada, Great Britain and other countries. He continued to coordinate the center's international efforts to bring Holocaust perpetrators to justice. These efforts have influenced the passage of special laws in Canada (1987), Australia (1989) and Great Britain (1991) which enable the prosecution in those countries of Nazi war criminals.\n\nSince the dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the fall of Communism, Zuroff has played a major role in the efforts to convince Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia and other post-Communist societies to confront the widespread complicity of their nationals in the crimes of the Holocaust and to prosecute local Nazi collaborators. His public advocacy on these issues has been instrumental in the submission by Lithuania and Latvia of indictments (Lileikis, Gimžauskas, Dailidė) and/or extradition requests (Kalējs, Gecas) against local Holocaust perpetrators.\n\nIn 1993, Zuroff was appointed by the then Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to serve on the joint Israeli-Lithuanian commission of inquiry established to deal with pardons issued by the authorities of Lithuania, which had recently regained independence, to people suspected of Nazi war crimes, which has succeeded to date in achieving the cancellation by the Lithuanian authorities of approximately 200 rehabilitations granted to individuals who had participated in the murder of Jews during the Holocaust. In 2000 he claimed to have exposed the rehabilitations granted by the government of Latvia to alleged Nazi war criminals and has led the efforts to cancel these pardons.\n\nZuroff played an important role in the exposure, arrest, extradition and prosecution of Dinko Šakić, the former commandant of the Ustasha concentration camp Jasenovac. In early October 1999, Šakić, who lived for more than 50 years in Argentina, was sentenced in Zagreb to 20 years’ imprisonment (which was the maximum penalty under Croatian law at the time) for his crimes in the first-ever trial of a Nazi war criminal in a post-Communist country.\nIn his book \"Occupation: Nazi-Hunter; The Continuing Search for the Perpetrators of the Holocaust\" (KTAV; Hoboken, 1994), Zuroff chronicles the belated efforts to prosecute Nazi war criminals in western democracies and explains the rationale for such efforts several decades after the crimes. The book was published in German by Ahriman Verlag. Starting in June 1999, Zuroff's activities as a Nazi-hunter were the subject of several television documentaries. The first, entitled \"The Nazi-Hunter\", was produced by ZDF (German Channel 2) in 1999; the second, entitled \"The Last Nazi-Hunter\", was produced by SWR (German Channel 1-regional station) in 2004 and the third, \"The Final Hunt for the Nazis\", by France 3 (Channel 3), was broadcast in December 2005.\n\nIn 2002, together with Aryeh Rubin, the founder of the Targum Shlishi Foundation of Miami, Florida, Zuroff launched Operation Last Chance, which offers financial rewards for information which will facilitate the prosecution and punishment of Nazi war criminals. To date, the project has been initiated in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia (all in 2002); Poland, Romania, Austria (2003); Croatia, Hungary (2004) and Germany (2005). On January 15, 2008, the prize was increased from $10,000 to $25,000.\n\nHis second book on the hunt for Nazi war criminals, \"Chasseur de nazis\" (Paris: Michel-Lafon, 2008), written together with French journalist Alexandre Duyck, continues with the story of the renewed efforts spearheaded by Zuroff to hold Holocaust perpetrators accountable, especially in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Union and the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, and focuses on the results achieved by \"Operation: Last Chance\". That book was published in Serbian by the Zavod za udzbenike publishing company under the title \"Lovac na naciste\" in 2009 and in Polish by Wydawnictwo Dolnoslaskie under the title \"Lowca Nazistow\" in 2010.\n\nZuroff almost completely rewrote the French book about Operation Last Chance in a volume published in English in 2009 by Palgrave Macmillan: \"Operation Last Chance: One Man's Quest to Bring Nazi Criminals to Justice\". That book was published in German by Prospero Verlag in late 2011 under the title \"Operation Last Chance; Im Fadenkreuz des \"Nazi Jaegers\"\" and updated versions were published in 2012 in Serbian, Hungarian, and Finnish. In 2013, Propero Verlag published an updated German version.\n\nIn 2006, his exposure in Budapest of convicted but unpunished Hungarian gendarme war criminal Dr. Sándor Képíró, who was said to be among the officers responsible for the mass murder of approximately 2,000 civilians in the city of Novi Sad, led to a criminal investigation against him, with his trial opening on May 5, 2011. A lawsuit by Képíró against Zuroff for libel, was denied. On July 18, 2011, the first-degree judgment declared Sándor Képíró's innocence, but the prosecution appealed against the sentence. Kepiro died in early September 2011, before the appeal was heard. Charles Zentai, who is accused of murdering an 18-year-old Jew, was located by Zuroff and the Hungarian government asked for his extradition from Australia to stand trial in Budapest. After the not guilty verdict, László Karsai, the leading Hungarian Holocaust historian and son of a Holocaust survivor, criticized Zuroff by saying:\nZuroff, continued the hunt for the Nazi war criminal Aribert Heim after Simon Wiesenthal died in 2005. On July 6, 2008, Zuroff headed to South America as part of a public campaign to capture Aribert Heim. He elaborated on July 15, 2008, that he was sure Heim was alive and the groundwork had been laid to capture him within weeks. In fall 2009, his hunt for Aribert Heim, who committed war crimes in the Mauthausen concentration camp, was the subject of a BBC documentary entitled \"The Search for Dr. Death\", and a fifth documentary \"Tzayad ha-Natzim ha-Acharon (The Last Nazi-Hunter)\", was broadcast on Israeli Channel 10 on Holocaust Memorial Day in 2012.\n\nZuroff was lukewarm in his reaction to the reported death of Heim in Cairo in 1992. He observed in February 2009 that:\nZuroff concedes, however, that Heim had undoubtedly lived in hiding in Egypt. Aribert Heim had reportedly killed \"hundreds of inmates at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria by injecting gasoline into their hearts and performing surgery and severing organs without anaesthesia\" notes Zuroff. In a 2011 interview he called Heim, \"his biggest failure.\" In the light of fresh revelations about the extent to which the CIA and West German intelligence co-operated with Nazi criminals after the war, Zuroff said he thought it quite possible that Heim worked for West German intelligence and that this may have been the reason that he was never prosecuted.\n\nOver the years Zuroff has published more than 350 articles on various topics relating to the Holocaust, as well as other issues of concern in the Jewish world. His publications have appeared in scholarly journals such as \"Yad Vashem Studies\", \"Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual\", \"Jewish Political Studies Review\", and \"American Jewish History\", as well as in the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Sueddeutsche Zeitung\" (Germany), \"die Tageszeitung\" (Germany), \"Profil\"(Austria), \"Boston Globe\", \"Jerusalem Post\", \"Tikkun\", \"Jerusalem Report\", \"Maariv\", \"Haaretz\", \"Yediot Achronot\", \"The Jewish Chronicle\", \"Eretz Acheret\", and other publications.\n\nZuroff has lectured extensively to audiences all over the world regarding the efforts to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. During the years 1992-1999, he served in the Education Corps of the Israeli Defense Forces (reserves) and lectured to thousands of soldiers about his work.\n\nIn 1995 and 1996, Zuroff was invited to Rwanda to assist the local authorities in their efforts to bring to justice the perpetrators of the genocide which took place in that country in spring 1994, and he has served as an official advisor to the Rwandan government.\n\nIn recognition of his efforts as a Nazi-hunter and Holocaust scholar, Zuroff was nominated by Serbian President Boris Tadić and the members of parliament of the Democratic Party of Serbia as a candidate for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nOn January 22, 2009, he was granted the honorary citizenship of the Serbian city of Novi Sad, in appreciation for the exposure of Sándor Képíró, who allegedly helped organize the murder of the city's Jews.\n\nOn January 15, 2010, Zuroff was decorated with the Order of Duke Trpimir by Croatian President Stjepan Mesić for special contributions against historical revisionism and for the reaffirming of antifascist foundations of the modern Republic of Croatia.\n\nOn February 16, 2017, the President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolic awarded the Gold Medal for Merit to Dr. Efraim Zuroff for \"exceptional achievements\" and his \"selfless dedication to defending the truth about the suffering of Jews, and also Serbs, Roma and other nations during World War II\".\n\nHe has four children and 12 grandchildren.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3551941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3551941", "title": "Gaetano Crocco", "text": "Gaetano Crocco\n\nGaetano Arturo Crocco (26 October 1877 – 19 January 1968) was an Italian scientist and aeronautics pioneer, the founder of the Italian Rocket Society, and went on to become Italy's leading space scientist. He was born in Naples.\n\nIn 1927, Crocco begun working with solid-propellant rockets and, in 1929, designed and built the first liquid-propellant rocket motors in Italy. He began work with monopropellants (fuel and oxidizer combined in one chemical liquid) in 1932, making him one of the first researchers in this field.\n\nAs head of the School of Aeronautics of the University of Rome, he performed research on flight mechanics, structural design, and high-altitude flight in addition to his work in rocket propulsion.\n\nBecause of his early efforts in aeronautics, Italian satellites were launched starting in the 1960s.\nThe San Marco programme was a cooperative effort of NASA and the Italian Space Commission, with NASA providing launch vehicles, use of its facilities, and training of Italian personnel.\n\nG.A. Crocco is a pioner both in aeronautics and astronautics. In 1898 he was serving in the Italian Army Engineers Corps in the Wireless Dept. when he met Captain Maurizio Moris. Moris, heading a Specialists Brigade, was deeply interested in the new field of aeronautics: he took Crocco in his staff starting a lifelong cooperation. At the time the Specialists Brigade was testing anchored balloons on the Bracciano Lake, north of Rome. Since 1904 Crocco started experimenting with airships. In 1906, together with Ottavio Ricaldoni he developed Airship 1 featuring a revolutionary semi-rigid flexible structure. On October 31, 1908, piloting an improved version of the airship, the N1, supplied with a rudder and direction indicators, Crocco flew from Vigna di Valle to Rome and back, covering 50 miles in one hour and a half. N1 was the first airship ever to fly over Rome at an attitude of 500 mt (1500 ft). In 1912 Crocco and Rinaldoni tested an hydroplane on the Bracciano lake while experimenting with airships together with other researchers (one of them, Umberto Nobile, would become eventually a famous polar explorer). In the meantime Crocco kept studying propellers’ shapes and sections and in 1914 drew plans for a closed-circuit wind tunnel to be built in Rome. In 1923 Crocco started studying space flight, jet propulsion and rocket fuels. In 1927 the Aeronautic Experimental Institute where Crocco was working, obtained a 200,000 ItL financing (equivalent to today’s 1million Euro) to develop black-powder-fuelled rockets to be tested later in a BPD firing range at Segni, east of Rome. He moved onto research on liquid fuels, drawing plans for the first Italian-built combustion chamber, tested in 1930 with the help of his son, Luigi Crocco. The outbreak of WWii and lack of financing confined Crocco to academic activities: he directed the Aeronautic Engineering School from 1935 to 1942 and then again from 1948 to 1952, when Luigi Broglio succeeded him in the post. In those years Crocco wrote hundreds of papers and patented so many inventions that his students used to say in mock poetry \"Everything I use or see, Oh my Crocco is made by thee.\" \n\nAfter WW II Crocco went back to his old passions, missiles and astronautics, creating in 1950 an informative course on superior ballistics within the Aeronautic Engineering School. In the inaugural speech he spoke extensively on man-made satellites and rocket trajectories. In 1951 he founded the Italian Rocket Association (AIR) to rally all the fans of the new astronautic science. In 1951, a full decade before the Gagarin space flight, he held a meeting on the problems of a manned spaceship re-entry in the atmosphere. Later on he devised a parallel-stage rocket, a method more rarely applied than tandem stages. \n\nIn 1956 Crocco, more than 80 years old, produced what is considered his most important contribution to world astronautics: in his “One-Year Exploration-Trip Earth-Mars-Venus-Earth” paper presented at the Seventh Congress of the International Astronautical Federation IAF, Rome, in 1956, he suggested exploiting the Mars and Venus gravitational fields as propelling forces to cut dramatically the travelling time of a space capsule. This ‘gravitational slingshot’ or ‘gravity assist’ or ‘swing-by’ method was such that the NASA recommended the study of his theories and especially his swing-by maneuvers contracting firms working on interplanetary flight and its perspectives.\n\nBasing his calculations on Hohmann’s orbit, the sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke had stated once that an Earth to Mars flight with a minimum fuel consumption would require at least 259 days. Then another 425 days should elapse on the Red Planet to re-align the planets so as to travel back again in 259 days. Crocco deemed this period too long and drew his own calculations exploiting Mars gravity pull to fly over the planet without landing. Mars gravity would deflect the spaceship’s trajectory towards the Earth cutting the flight’s overall length to less than a year, the only objection being the poor quality of data gathered passing over Mars at an altitude of more than a million miles. But, Crocco added, should the spaceship be re-directed towards Venus and not the Earth, it would fly over Mars at a much closer range: observation by the astronauts would be much more satisfactory, and moreover they could observe Venus as well, still keeping the trip’s time under a year. He calculated 113 days from Earth to Mars, 154 to reach Venus from Mars and 98 days from Venus back to Earth and affirmed that the first occasion for this ‘Crocco Grand Tour’ would be occurring in 1971. Such missions have not been attempted but many interplanetary space probes have used similar gravity assist manoeuvres.\n\n\n"}

Van der Wouwer, and Arthur Morren, a wealthy merchant of grain in Antwerp, was born in Ekeren, the northern district of Antwerp, during the reign of King Leopold II. He grew up in a bourgeois and Francophile family. His upbringing included an artistic education. The painter and friend of the family Emile Claus who taught him and his brothers several times a week served as his first mentor. In 1888 Claus convinced Arthur Morren to enter his son at the Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen but he left after a short time, disliking the conformist teaching methods.\n\nIn 1888 he moved to Paris, where he frequented the studios of Alfred Roll, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Eugène Carrière. He began working in an Impressionist style. In 1889 Morren was acquainted with Henry van de Velde. Thanks to van de Velde, he attended the trade fairs in Brussels, the exhibitions of the Société des Vingt, the art exhibitions of the freelance painters in Paris (Third French Republic) and the Belgian and foreign artists of the Avantgarde. Under the influence of Henry van de Velde, Morren made some works between 1890 and 1892, featuring closely and regularly spaced dots of contrasting color, conforming to pointilist theories of the French painter Georges Seurat.\n\nIn the summer of 1892, eschewing the shortened painting process which was associated with Neo-Impressionism, he began to work in a more spontaneous manner, creating more space for emotions. Influenced by the ideas of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland painters William Morris and Walter Crane, both advocates of applied art, he took part between 1893 and 1900 in the creation of jewelry, articles of daily use, wallpaper, etc. During this time, he also completed his artistic training in Paris. He was active in the Atelier of French painters Alfred Philippe Roll, Eugène Carrière, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Henri Gervex. He became one of the most eager admirers of the French Impressionists. After three years in Paris he returned to Antwerp where he participated in several avant-garde groups, particularly Als ik Kan, L’Association pour l’Art, La Libre Esthétique and Eenigen. In the latter he was a founder-member in 1902. Morren created light-flooded paintings, exhibited at the fairs La Libre Esthétique in Brussels, the 'Vie et Lumière', and at numerous international exhibitions between 1895 and 1913. Contributing to Luminism he reached the summit of his second major artistic period between 1904 and 1907 (\" Le mois des roses et L'été \") which ended on the eve of the World War One.\n\nIn 1897 he married Juliette Melges. The couple lived in Antwerp for ten years before moving to Brussels in 1910. He also acquired a property in France, near the town Saint-Germain-en-Laye. It was in this idyllic environment, not far from the estates of the French painters Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard whom he visited several times where he spent most of his time. Towards 1913, he entered a new creative period. The colors in his new works were more subdued. He used grated rough pigment and pastels. Morren remained faithful to impressionist ideals and did not participate in new trends, such as Cubism or Expressionism. He dealt with the scenes of everyday life ('La pergola', 1929), interiors, still lifes (\" Pivoines \", 1919), landscapes and portraits. His palette became darker and his paintings developed a solemnity and clarity of expression ('Le sommeil', 1922).\n\nHe returned to Belgium in 1926 exhibiting works from his entire creative period in the Galerie Georges Giroux in Brussels. The press unanimously praised the retrospective but it drew less attention from the public. In 1931 a new retrospective took place at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles. This time the exhibition was a great success and attracted a wide audience.\n\nIn a letter of 1934 he wrote that he had destroyed or altered some of his earlier works. In his last creative period (\" période de synthèse \") he turned to a smooth painting style. The lacquer layer used is thin and distributed over a large area similar to a watercolor. If some form of Impressionism occasionally appeared in the landscapes, it showed less glimmer. Color was increasingly used independently of the play of light and shadows disappeared. More emphasis was placed on the aesthetics of the transient with constantly changing color variations (\" Le bâton de rouge \", 1941).\n\nIn 1936 his wife died. A year later, he married Orpha Demets (Born November 1911). George Morren died in his home in Brussels on the 21st of November 1941 during his preparation for a new retrospective at the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels. This took place in April 1942. It was overshadowed by the German occupation during the Second World War.\n\n\n"}

He arrives at his court at Celliwig but is denied by the Glewlwyd, the chief porter. Culhwch threatens to wreak havoc unless he is granted entry to the court and, eventually, Glewlwyd relents. In a bombastic speech given in this tale, Glewlwyd recounts his history to Arthur, in which he claims to have been in different exotic locations across the world and Otherworld, often alongside Arthur:\n\nThis passage is closely related to the narrative of the tenth-century poem ; \"What man is the porter,\" in which Glewlwyd is the titular gatekeeper of fortress to which Arthur and his men are seeking admittance. To prove their right of entry Arthur relates the feats and achievements of his men; particularly those of Cai and Bedwyr.\n\nLater on in \"Culhwch ac Olwen\", Glewlwyd leads his servants during the hunt for the man-turned-boar, Twrch Trwyth, and three of them, Huandaw, Gogigwr and Penpingion, are killed in the process, mortally wounded by the quarry. Glewlwyd is left with Llaesgymyn, \"a man who was no use to anyone\" as his sole remaining servant.\n\nGlewlwyd is named twice in the Welsh Triads. He is listed as one of the twenty-four ordained knights of Arthur's court and is regarded as one of the \"Three Offensive Knights of Arthur’s Court\", alongside Sanddef and Morfran. They are known as the offensive knights because it is \"repugnant to anyone to refuse them anything: Sanddef because of his beauty, Morfran because of his ugliness, and Glewlwyd because of his size and his strength and his ferocity.\" He is further named as the lover of Dyfyr Golden-Hair, one of the Three Famous Maidens of Arthur's Court.\n\nIn \"The Lady of the Fountain\", the tale of the knight Owain, Glewlwyd is present at Arthur's court at Caerleon, once again in the role of gatekeeper, \"greeting guests and foreigners, beginning to honour them, telling them the customs and habits of the court, and informing those who had the right to go to the hall or chamber or who merited lodging.\" In the romance of \"Geraint fab Erbin\", Glewlwyd is once again chief gatekeeper at Caerleon, although it is stated \"he did not trouble himself over this service except on one of the three important festivals.\" During the rest of the year, his duties are shared by his seven assistants: Gryn, Penpingion, Llaesgymyn, Gogyfwlch, Gwrddnei Cat-Eye, Drem ap Dremidydd and Clust fab Clusfeinydd.\n\nGlewlwyd is further mentioned in satirical fifteenth or sixteenth parody, \"Araith Iolo Goch\", in which a certain \"amorous-mannered, grief-pallored, pale-cheeked youth\" from Gwynedd seeks the heart of a maiden from Powys. In a conversation between the lady and her suitor, Glewlwyd's great strength is alluded to. Glewlwyd is described as \"the man who lifted the cauldron down from the fire with one hand in the court of Toron of the three islands of Britain, with the sliced meat of seven oxen boiling in it\". Whether or not this refers to a genuine tradition concerning Glewlwyd's exploits, or is merely an invention on the author's part, is unknown.\n"}
{"id": "13244371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13244371", "title": "Greek name", "text": "Greek name\n\nIn the modern world, personal names among people of Greek language and culture generally consist of a given name, a patronymic and a family name. \n\nAncient Greeks generally had a single name, often qualified with a patronymic, a clan or tribe, or a place of origin. Married women were identified by the name of their husbands, not their fathers.\n\nHereditary family names or surnames began to be used by élites in the Byzantine period. Well into the 9th century, they were rare. But by the 11th and 12th centuries, élite families often used family names. Family names came from placenames, nicknames, or occupations.\n\nIt is not clear when stable family surnames became widely used. Though élite families often had stable family names, many of the \"last names\" used by Greeks into the 19th century were either patronymics or nicknames. It is also possible that family names were simply not recorded because Ottoman administrative practice preferred patronymics, and did not require surnames.\n\nIn the 19th century, patronymic surnames became common.\n\nFor personal names, from the first century CE until the nineteenth century CE, pagan names from antiquity were mostly replaced by names from Christian scriptures and tradition. With the Modern Greek Enlightenment and the development of Greek nationalism, names from antiquity became popular again.\n\nFamily names may be patronymic in origin or else based on occupation, location, or personal characteristic. These origins are often indicated by prefixes or suffixes. Traditionally a woman used a feminine version of her father's family name, replacing it with a feminine version of her husband's family name on marriage. In modern Greece, a woman keeps her father's family name for life but may use a husband's name. \n\nIn official documents in modern Greece, people are given three names: a given name, a patronymic and a family name. \n\nUntil the late 18th century, almost all Christian Greeks were named for [[Saint#Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox saints]] from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments and early [[Christian]] tradition. Since then, names of both deities and mortals from antiquity have been popular as well.\n\nMale names usually end in -ας, -ης, and -ος, but sometimes ancient forms are also used. Female names almost always end in -α and -η, though a few end in -ώ with -ου being possible.\n\nSince antiquity, there has been a strong tradition of naming the first son after the paternal grandfather and the second after the maternal grandfather. This results in a continuation of names in the family line.\n\nThere is a strong clustering of first names by locality according to patron saints, famous churches or monasteries. Examples include:\n\nWhen Greek names are used in other languages, they are sometimes rendered phonetically, such as \"Eleni\" for Ἑλένη, and sometimes by their equivalents, like \"Helen\" in English or \"Hélène\" in French. In the United States, there are also [[Anglicization of names#Greek given names|conventional anglicizations]] based on phonetic similarity rather than etymology, for example James or Jimmy for Δημήτρης/Dimitris (nickname Ντίμης/Dimi, hence Jimmy), when the English name James is a derivative of Ἰάκωβος/ Iakovos.\n\nGreek family names are most commonly patronymics but may also be based on occupation, personal characteristics or location. The [[feminine gender|feminine]] version is usually the [[genitive case|genitive]] of the family name of the woman's father or husband; so, for example, Mr. Yannatos and Mrs. [[Savina Yannatou|Yannatou]].\n\nAs a result of their codification in the Modern Greek state, surnames have [[Katharevousa]] forms even though Katharevousa is no longer the official standard. Thus, the Ancient Greek name Eleutherios forms the Modern Greek proper name Lefteris. In the past, people in speaking used the family name followed by the given name, so John Eleutherios was called Leftero-giannis. In modern practice he is called Giannis Eleftheriou, where Giannis is the popular form of the formal Ioannis but Eleftheriou is an archaic genitive. For women the surname is usually a Katharevousa genitive of a male name, whereas back in Byzantine times there were separate feminine forms of male surnames, such as \"Palaiologína\" for \"Palaiológos\" which nowadays would be \"Palaiológou\".\n\nIn the past, women would change their surname on first marrying to that of their husband in the genitive case, so marking the change of dependence to husband from father. In early Modern Greek society, women were named with \"-aina\" as a feminine suffix on the husband's given name, for example \"Giorgaina\" signifing \"wife of George\". Nowadays, a woman's surname does not change upon marriage but she can use the husband's surname socially. Children usually receive the paternal surname, though some children receive the maternal surname in addition or exclusively.\n\nIn official documents, the father's name in the genitive will be inserted between a person's first and last names. For example, if John Papadopoulos has a daughter named Mary and a son named Andrew, they will be referred to as \"María Ioánnou Papadopoúlou\" and \"Andréas Ioánnou Papadópoulos\". If Mary then marries George Demetriádes, she may retain her original name or choose to be called \"María Geōrgíou Demetriádou\".

After graduating in 1899, Haseltine went to Munich Academy in Germany to study drawing and then to the Académie Julian in Paris, France where he studied painting.\n\nAfter his first piece of sculpture met with success, he pursued that artistic avenue. Inspired by the gathering of artists from around the world to the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, Haseltine chose to make Paris his home for the next thirty-five years until the German occupation of France during World War II. He moved to the United States where he remained until 1947 at which time he returned to France.\n\nHaseltine sculpted a variety of animals but is best known for his equestrian sculptures, most notably the 1934 life-size statue of the thoroughbred race horse Man o' War at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky and \"George Washington on Horseback\", Gilded bronze statue at the Washington National Cathedral made in 1959. He also traveled to India, where he made an oversized statue of one of the ancestors of the Maharaja of Nawanagar, Jam Shri Rawalji in 1933. It can still be seen there. He replicated many of his large works in table-top sizes. The author of a number of books on animalier art, Haseltine was well connected in American upper class society and did a three-year project to create a work for heiress Barbara Hutton. This project included two horses heads which were gilded bronze, with precious and semi precious stones. After her death the heads disappeared and resurfaced a few years ago at an auction in New York.\n\nDuring the time he lived in Paris at the Impasse Raffet (XVIeme Quartier) near the Rue Jasmin, he led a very colourful life. Attached to American Embassy, Paris, 1914-1915, Decorated Chevalier Legion of Honor in 1922, He entertained a lot of guests in his beautiful house, which was once depicted in the French Magazine \"Maison & Jardin\". Amongst his guests were Arthur Rubinstein, Cary Grant, Teddy Roosevelt Jr and Charles Lindbergh. He also had a lot of contacts to highest Russian Royalty. His wife, the former Madeleine Keith, was born in England and died in 1979 in Paris. The house was subsequently sold to the owner of Paris Match. His daughter Helen Heather Haseltine married an Austrian Count by the name of Paul Maria Prosper Toggenburg (b. 09-04-1904 in Trento, d.02-07-1964 in Ritten, Trentino-Südtirol, Italy) so becoming Gräfin Toggenburg, her descendants live in Italy and Austria now. By his son, William Marshall, he has two grandchildren, of which one, Carla, is a well-respected sculptor in her own right.\n\nHerbert Haseltine died in Paris, in 1962. He was buried at the Protestant Cemetery Caius Cestius in Rome, where are also the graves of his parents, of his brothers Stanley Lane, Charles Marshall and his sister Mildred princess Rospigliosi.\n\n\n\n"}

During this time they met many of the guiding lights of the mid-1960s cultural movement and presaged what are commonly thought of as hippies with odd behavior, tie-dyed and red, white and blue clothing, and renunciation of normal society, which they dubbed The Establishment. Tom Wolfe chronicled their early escapades in \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\"; Wolfe also documents a notorious 1966 trip on \"Further\" from Mexico through Houston, stopping to visit Kesey's friend, novelist Larry McMurtry. Kesey was in flight from a drug charge at the time.\nNotable members of the group include Kesey's best friend Ken Babbs, Carolyn \"Mountain Girl\" Garcia, Lee Quarnstrom, and Neal Cassady. Stewart Brand, Dorothy Fadiman, Paul Foster, Dale Kesey (his cousin), George Walker, the Warlocks (now known as the Grateful Dead), Del Close (then a lighting designer for the Grateful Dead), Wavy Gravy, Paul Krassner, and Kentucky Fab Five writers Ed McClanahan and Gurney Norman (who overlapped with Kesey and Babbs as creative writing graduate students at Stanford University) were associated with the group to varying degrees.\n\nThese events are also documented by one of the original pranksters, Lee Quarnstrom, in his memoir, \"When I Was a Dynamiter\".\n\nIn an interview on BBC World Service in August 2014, Ken Babbs suggested that the name \"The Merry Pranksters\" was his idea:\n\nAlthough a great many friends and associates spent time with Kesey at his La Honda, California ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Francisco, the core group of 14 people who became the 'Merry Band of Pranksters' that drove across the country in 1964 were:\n\nOther on-again, off-again Pranksters—who did not participate in the first cross-country journey (but may have the later trips) -- include but are not limited to:\n\nOn June 17, 1964, Kesey and 13 Merry Pranksters boarded \"Furthur\" at Kesey's ranch in La Honda, California, and set off eastward. Kesey wanted to see what would happen when hallucinogenic-inspired spontaneity confronted what he saw as the banality and conformity of American society. Ken Babbs has suggested that the bus trip reversed the historic American westward movement.\n\nThe trip's original purpose was to celebrate the publication of Kesey's novel \"Sometimes a Great Notion\" (1964) and to visit the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. The Pranksters were enthusiastic users of marijuana, amphetamines, and LSD, and in the process of their journey are said to have \"turned on\" many people by introducing them to these drugs.\n\nThe psychedelically painted bus's stated destination — \"further\" — was the Merry Pranksters' goal: a destination that could be reached only through the expansion of one's own perception of reality.\n\nNovelist Robert Stone, who met the bus on its arrival in New York, wrote in his memoir \"\" (2007) that those accompanying Kesey on the trip were Neal Cassady (described by Stone as \"the world's greatest driver, who could roll a joint while backing a 1937 Packard onto the lip of the Grand Canyon\"), Ken Babbs (\"fresh from the Nam, full of radio nomenclature, and with a command voice that put cops to flight\"), Jane Burton (\"a pregnant young philosophy professor who declined no challenges\"), George Walker, Sandy Lehmann-Haupt (dis-MOUNT), Mike Hagen (Mal Function), Ron Bevirt (Hassler), Chuck Kesey, Dale Kesey, John Babbs, Steve Lambrecht and Paula Sundstren (aka Gretchin Fetchin, Slime Queen).\n\nZane Kesey and Simon Babbs edited the video and audio clips made by the Pranksters on the trip to produce a DVD (1999) called simply \"The Acid Test\", which is distributed by Key-z Productions.\n\nKesey and the Pranksters also had a relationship with the outlaw motorcycle gang the Hells Angels, whom Kesey introduced to LSD. The details of their relationship are documented in Wolfe's above-mentioned book, in Hunter S. Thompson's book, \"\" (1966), and in Allen Ginsberg's poem about the Kesey/Angels relationship, titled \"First Party at Ken Kesey's with Hell's Angels\" (December 1965).\n\nIn 1969, \"Further\" and the Pranksters (minus Kesey) attended the Woodstock rock festival. In the same year, they attended the Texas Pop Festival at Lewisville, Texas.\n\nKesey's \"Demon Box\" (1986), a collection of short pieces, several about the Merry Pranksters, was a critical success. A subsequent novel, \"Sailor Song\" (1992), was not, with critics complaining it was too spacey for comprehension. In 1994, Kesey toured with the Pranksters, performing \"Twister: A Ritual Reality in Three Quarters Plus Overtime if Necessary\", a play he wrote in 1989 about the millennium, influenced by L. Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz works.\n\nThe Merry Pranksters filmed and audiotaped much of what they did on their bus trips. Some of this material has surfaced in documentaries, including the BBC's \"Dancing In the Street\". Some Pranksters have released footage on their own, and a version of the film edited by Kesey is available through his son Zane's website. On August 14, 1997, Kesey appeared with the Merry Pranksters at a Phish concert during a performance of the song \"Colonel Forbin's Ascent\" from the album \"The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday\" (1987).\nKesey and the Pranksters also helped stage The Enit Festival, held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium on November 22, 1997, with Jane's Addiction, Funky Tekno Tribe, Goldie, and Res Fest rounding out the bill.\n\nThe original Prankster bus is at Kesey's farm in Oregon. In November 2005, it was pulled out of the swamp by Zane Kesey and family and a group of the original Merry Pranksters with the intent of restoring it. The Smithsonian Institution sought to acquire the bus, which is no longer operable, but Kesey refused, and attempted, unsuccessfully, to prank the Smithsonian by passing off a phony bus.\n\nKesey died of complications due to liver cancer in November 2001. Ken Babbs attempts to keep the Prankster spirit alive through his Skypilot Club website, a spoof of 1950s comic book clubs that encourages psychedelic ideals and \"mind-expanding\" experiences, particularly through immersion in love.\n\nOn December 10, 2003, Babbs hosted a memorial to Kesey with String Cheese Incident and various other old and new Pranksters. It was held at the McDonald Theatre in Eugene, Oregon. The proceeds helped to raise money for the \"Ken Kesey Memorial\" sculpture designed by Peter Helzer. The bronze sculpture depicted a life-size Kesey reading to three children while seated on a curved granite bench covered with quotations from Kesey's novels \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1962) and \"Sometimes a Great Notion\" (1964). (Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Brian Lanker supplied the image.) Other benefactors for the project include Bob Weir, Paul Newman (who starred in the 1971 film adaptation of \"Sometimes a Great Notion\") and Michael Douglas (who produced the 1975 film version of \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\").\n\nIn 2005, Zane Kesey asked a friend, Matthew Rick, also known as Shady Backflash, to put on a 40th anniversary of his father's Acid Tests. Matthew gathered a small group of promoters, including Rob Robinson from New York, to help him produce the event, which was held in Las Vegas on October 31, 2005. It was known as AT40. Zane has hosted several Acid Test parties since then, including the 2011 Pop Quiz AT in Oakland CA.\n\nAlex Gibney and Alison Ellwood directed a documentary film \"Magic Trip\" (2011) about the Merry Pranksters, which was released on August 5, 2011.\n\nIn April 2014, Zane, along with friend Derek Stevens, announced a Kickstarter to fund a 50th anniversary Furthur Bus Trip, offering donors a chance to ride \"Further\". The fundraiser was successful, and the trip took place between June and September 2014. Over 100 participants were invited to ride on legs of the trip as a new batch of Merry Pranksters. The 2014 journey was over 15,000 miles, 53 different events, took place in 29 different states and was 75 days of Merry Prankster mayhem and fun on the road. A group of filmmakers from Canada are producing a documentary about the project slated for release in 2016 under the title \"Going Furthur\".\n\n \n"}

In April 1982, a confrontation occurred between his group and the police in which his brother Mokhtar was shot; this incident convinced him that violence was called for.\n\nIn July 1982, Bouyali took to the maquis, with significant support in local towns, particularly Larbaa. The \"Group for Defense against the Illicit\" announced its transformation into the Algerian Islamic Armed Movement (MAIA). According to the government, it planned a variety of attacks, including the assassination of the Prime Minister, which were forestalled by the arrest of 23 of its members in mid-December. Further arrests were made in January 1983. However, Bouyali himself evaded the security forces, and fled abroad (probably either Iran or Libya).\n\nIn May 1984, the government released some 92 of his supporters. Within a few months, he returned, reestablished his contacts, reconstituted the MAIA in February 1985, and began fighting again. In August, the group mounted two prominent operations - an armed robbery at a factory in Algiers on the 21st, and an attack on a police barracks in Soumaa on the 27th, killing a police cadet and taking weaponry. They painted the phrase \"Allah the Avenger is with us!\" across the gates of the barracks at Soumaa, to indicate that their motive was not simple criminality. Over the next two years, his group would continue its campaign, inflicting losses on government forces when pursued, but more generally targeting institutions it saw as un-Islamic, such as girls' schools, libraries, restaurants, and cinemas. On February 3, 1987, Bouyali finally fell in an ambush by the security services, and the movement was destroyed. Its surviving members were put on trial in July, with 5 of the 202 tried receiving the death penalty and 15 acquitted. The last of these were released on July 29, 1990. In 1991, several of these, led by Abdelkader Chebouti, reconstituted the organization as the Armed Islamic Movement. Shortly afterwards, some, such as Mansour Meliani, split with it to found the notably more violent Armed Islamic Group.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1338911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1338911", "title": "Paul Masson", "text": "Paul Masson\n\nPaul Masson (1859 – 1940) was an early pioneer of California viticulture and successful popularizer of Californian sparkling wine.\n\nMasson emigrated from the Burgundy region of France in 1878 to California, United States, where he met Charles Lefranc, one of a number of French immigrants who had expanded the viticulture introduced into the Santa Clara Valley by the Catholic mission fathers. Masson went back to France in 1880, but later returned to California due to the depression in the French wine industry caused by the Phylloxera plague. According to the Paul Masson company web site, in 1892 Masson's first sparkling wine under the name \"champagne\" was introduced at Almaden, and Masson eventually became known as the \"Champagne King of California\". Masson is buried at Oak Hill Memorial Park in San Jose.\n\nMasson shifted part of his production to the Santa Cruz Mountains above Saratoga, California and built his \"chateau\" on a knob overlooking the Santa Clara Valley in 1905. Now known as \"The Mountain Winery\", the Paul Masson Mountain Winery is on the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places, though it ceased making wines in 1952. Instead, it serves as a conferencing and events venue - various events are held at the winery, such as concert series, weddings, and other special events. A famous chess tournament was held there annually for a number of years in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Around 2000, the then-current owners of the site hired winemaker Jeffrey Patterson to restart winemaking on site. The vineyards were reestablished at the Mountain Winery in 2004.\n\nThe Paul Masson brand is best remembered for its 1978-1981 marketing association with actor-director Orson Welles, who promised for Masson: \"We will sell no wine before its time.\" An infamous, widely circulated and much-parodied outtake for one commercial from the campaign features Welles attempting to deliver his lines while severely inebriated. Welles was eventually fired as a spokesman for the brand in 1981, after answering a question about Paul Masson on a TV chat show, saying that he was now on a diet and so no longer drank wine; he was (briefly) replaced as spokesman by Sir John Gielgud.\n\nDespite the ads' success at the time, the Paul Masson brand has suffered from a long-term image problem, particularly since its founder's death in 1940, in being synonymous with low-end wines. As \"The New York Times\" observed in 1990: \"While many consumers know them - who can forget Orson Welles's breathy incantation of 'We will sell no wine before its time' for Masson - they lack cachet.\"\n\nIn the 1970s NASA bought Masson Rare Cream Sherry for a Skylab mission and packaged some for testing on a \"zero-G\" aircraft. Unfortunately, the smell quickly permeated the cabin making astronauts physically sick, and public pressure over taking alcohol into space led NASA to abandon their plans.\n\nThe Paul Masson winery and brand were owned for many years by The Seagram Company, Ltd, the global wine and spirits company (along with minority share owners). In the 1980s, Seagram also acquired the Taylor California Cellars brand (and production facilities) from Coca-Cola, based on the premise promoted by then Seagram Strategic Planning head, Mary Cunningham, that the only way to succeed in the wine business was to approach Gallo's massive sales volume. Over the next twenty years, the wine industry would dramatically segment itself with, essentially, all the large volume brands falling by the wayside. Internal competition and resulting cannibalization dramatically reduced the combined sales of Paul Masson and Taylor (as it did with Almaden and Inglenook, also owned by a single parent company).\n\nThese changes meant that the Paul Masson brand was sold to Vintners International in 1987.\n\nVintners was in turn purchased by the Centera Wine Company (formerly \"Canandaigua\") of New York in 1993, as part of Vintner's bankruptcy proceedings. Canandaigua was then renamed Constellation Brands in 2000.\n\nIn 2008, Wine Group LLC of San Francisco purchased the Paul Masson winery, which had ceased making wine in 1952, and now serves as a conferencing and events center. Wine Group LLC subsequently removed the Paul Masson name and renamed it \"The Mountain Winery\". Wine Group LLC also purchased two California wine brands from Constellation Brands, including the Paul Masson table wine range, currently consisting of three types of bottle sold - white, red, and rosé, made from grapes grown elsewhere in California. Meanwhile, Constellation Brands in New York continues to manufacture and sell the profitable Paul Masson brandies.\n"}

Morton Shand, was an English journalist, architecture critic (an early proponent of modernism), wine and food writer, entrepreneur and pomologist. He is also the paternal grandfather of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales.\n\nShand, the son of the writer and barrister Alexander Faulkner Shand and his wife Augusta Mary Coates, was born in Kensington, London. He was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, as well as studying at the Sorbonne, Paris, and in Heidelberg, Germany.\n\nShand was married four times. His first marriage was to Edith Marguerite Harrington in April 1916, with whom he had a son, Bruce Shand, father to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. They divorced in 1920.\n\nShand's second marriage was to Alys Fabre-Tonnerre, in 1920, with whom he had a daughter named Sylvia. They divorced in 1926, his wife having petitioned on the grounds of his adultery.\n\nShand's third marriage was to Georgette Thérèse Edmée Avril, who he married a month after the divorce decree for his second marriage was granted. They divorced in 1931, without having had any children.\n\nShand's fourth marriage was to Sybil Mary Sissons (previously Mrs. Slee) in 1931, with whom he had one daughter named Elspeth. Elspeth married Geoffrey Howe, later Baron Howe of Aberavon, who was then a lawyer and later a politician. Elspeth became a life peer in her own right as \"Baroness Howe of Idlicote\". Shand's step-daughter, Mary (Sybil's daughter from her first husband naval Commander John Ambrose Slee) married architect Sir James Stirling.\n\nShand died on 30 April 1960 (age 72) in Lyon, France. The poet John Betjeman and the French wine expert André Simon wrote addenda to Shand's obituary in \"The Times\".\n\nShand studied history at King's College, Cambridge, gaining his MA in 1914. Shand served in the First World War with the Royal Fusiliers regiment, and immediately afterwards, due to his fluent French and German, he was appointed as superintendent of all German prisoners' camps in France.\n\nAlready in 1914 he had translated from German to English Arthur Schnitzler's play \"Liebelei\", under the title \"Playing with Love\". Though his first major publications from that time were on food and wine, he began to also build a reputation as an architecture critic, working in particular for \"Architectural Review\", where he had been influential in steering the journal's then proprietor and sometimes editor Hubert de Cronin Hastings in favour of modernism.\n\nWhile living in Lyon, France, in the early 1920s, he was invited by the editor of the \"Architectural Association Journal\" to review the Exposition Internationale des Artes Décoratifs in Paris of 1925. In reviewing the exposition, he coined the term \"Swedish grace\" to describe the Scandinavian design of the time, evident in the work of among others Gunnar Asplund, though by that time a new, modernist architecture and design was emerging, as evident at the exposition in the work of its prime mover Le Corbusier.\n\nShand's first book on architecture, \"Modern Theatres and Cinemas\" was published in 1930 and featured many of those buildings he had encountered in Germany during the late 1920s, arguing that there the cinema had emerged as a separate design typology, not an adaptation of traditional theatre design.\n\nShand was befriended by some of the leading figures in European modernist architecture, including Peter Behrens, Le Corbusier, head of the Bauhaus Walter Gropius, Alvar Aalto and Swiss historian-critic Sigfried Giedion, keeping correspondence with each of them. He also developed close links with architects back in the UK, encouraging their participation in the modernist debate. Shand translated from German to English Gropius's 1925 book \"Die neue Architektur und das Bauhaus\", published in 1930 as \"The New Architecture and the Bauhaus\". Shand with furniture designer and entrepreneur Jack Pritchard helped with Gropius's emigration from Germany to the UK in 1934.\n\nLe Corbusier and Giedion had been prime movers in the foundation of the Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) in 1928, in the promotion of the cause of modernist architecture and town planning. Giedion was its first and only general secretary. There had been no British participants in the first CIAM conference in 1928. But in January 1929 Shand wrote to Gropius suggesting Howard Robinson, head of the Architectural Association school of architecture and Shand's own cousin, as the British CIAM representative. When this did not work out, Shand recommended Japan-born, Canada-educated architect Wells Coates. Shand, together with architects Coates, Maxwell Fry and F. R. S. Yorke were the founding members of the MARS Group (Modern Architectural Research Group), which operated from 1933 to 1937. The group came into existence at the prompting of Giedion, after Shand wrote to him. Shand, Coates, Yorke and three other members of the Mars Group attended their first CIAM congress in 1933, which took place on board an ocean-going liner journeying from Marseilles to Athens in July that year.\n\nA series of articles under the title \"Scenario for a Human Drama\", in \"Architectural Review\" of 1934–5, was Shand's attempt to document and place the contemporary architecture in Europe. In seven parts it set out ideas on the evolution of Continental modernism.\n\nShand was sued for bankruptcy in March 1933, with the court case taking place in August that year. That same year, however, with Geoffrey Boumphrey, he founded a company Finmar to import Finnish architect Alvar Aalto's furniture into the UK, for the purposes of which he set up an exhibition of Aalto's furniture and experimental wood reliefs at the Fortnum & Mason department store in London. In 1935 he visited Finland with Jack Pritchard and Graham Reid and saw Aalto's Paimio Sanatorium and the Artek furniture factory which made the furniture sold in the UK by Finmar.\n\nDespite his early enthusiasm for modernism in design and architecture, by the late 1950s he was far more critical towards the results of modern architecture, writing that:\nShand demonstrated his knowledge of food and wine in articles and books published during the 1920s. He set out his viewpoint at the beginning of the 300-page \"A Book of Food\" (1927): \"This is frankly a book of prejudices, for all food is a question of likes and dislikes. One may be tolerant about religion, politics, and a hundred and one other things, but not about the food that one eats.\"\n\n\n"}

Following their name change in 2004, the Chicken Heads have since focused more on multi-media projects centered on this mythology, including music videos, concept albums, YouTube skits, stage plays, a role-playing computer game and an independently-produced television pilot.\n\nTo date, the band has released three studio albums and one compilation under the name \"Radioactive Chicken Heads\", with one studio album, one EP and six self-produced demo cassettes released during their time as \"Joe and the Chicken Heads\". Their most recent album, \"Tales From The Coop\", was released in October 2017.\n\nIn a rare out-of-character interview, lead singer Carrot Topp explained that the genesis of the Radioactive Chicken Heads began with two comic books he had written as a teenager, one about a gang of mutant vegetables called The Vegamatics and another called \"Joe and the Chicken Heads\" about a kid named Joe who sings with a rock band made up of headless chickens. After discovering the comedy metal band Green Jellÿ, a group renowned for their use of puppets and costumes, Carrot Topp ultimately decided to apply these concepts and visuals to a rock band combining elements of both comic books, creating the band's distinctive masks and props himself.\n\nJoe and the Chicken Heads were officially formed in late 1993, though the band didn't play their first show until February 26, 1994, at a Bar Mitzvah in Orange, California. Despite recording several demo tapes and appearing on numerous local compilations during the mid-1990s, the Chicken Heads performed few live shows until the arrival of the late 1990s ska revival helped the band attract a wider following within the Orange County's booming ska and punk scene, sharing the stage with such notable ska acts as Link 80, Slow Gherkin and Bim Skala Bim and receiving regular airplay on KUCIs influential Ska Parade radio show, which hosted many up and coming local ska and punk bands. The band's outrageous costumes and live shows soon began attracting publicity both positive and negative from local papers and zines including \"OC Weekly\", \"LA Weekly\", \"The Daily Trojan\", \"X-TRA\" and \"Maximumrocknroll\", with \"Thrasher\" magazine inexplicably describing them as \"more fun than a shopping spree in a Mexican supermarket\".\n\nIn late 1997, following a staged altercation with The Aquabats, the Chicken Heads waged a mock rivalry against the costumed superhero-themed band, a feud which was even covered in the \"OC Weekly\" newspaper at a time when both bands were experiencing notable local popularity. Though this rivalry never reached its fruition onstage, the Chicken Heads received a jokingly disparaging reference on the Ska Parade's infamous \"GWAR vs. The Aquabats\" radio skit the same year, wherein Aquabats lead singer The MC Bat Commander, turning down an offer to save the world because his band won't get paid, remarks \"with that kind of motivation, you can probably get Joe and the Chicken Heads\".\n\nIn 1998, the Chicken Heads made their national television debut playing the song \"Pest Control\" on a Halloween-themed episode of \"Extreme Gong\", a short-lived revival of the 1970s \"Gong Show\" game show which aired on the Game Show Network. Although the band were \"gonged\" mid-performance, signifying that the call-in voters disapproved of their act and wanted them to stop, the Chicken Heads finished their song anyway, claiming that they were playing so loud that they couldn't hear the gong.\n\nJoe and the Chicken Heads independently released their first and only album \"Keep on Cluckin\" in May 2000, featuring 26 songs which had been recorded over the span of three years. In wake of the album's release, the Chicken Heads began playing shows with much more frequency, forming a touring relationship with their original inspirations Green Jellÿ while also sharing bills with punk bands including the Angry Samoans, D.I., Litmus Green and The Briefs. In May 2002, the band released their final work as Joe and the Chicken Heads, a five-track mini CD single entitled \"Family Album\".\n\nAfter a period of time performing as \"The Rock N' Roll Chicken Heads\" and \"The Chicken Heads\", Joe and the Chicken Heads permanently changed their name to \"The Radioactive Chicken Heads\" in mid-2004. According to their website, the \"official\" tongue-in-cheek reason behind the name change was due to \"new government regulations which require all radioactive farm products to be labeled clearly\".\n\nThe Radioactive Chicken Heads self-released their first album under their new name, \"Growing Mold\", in March 2005. Mixed, engineered and featuring instrumental contributions by avant-garde composer Ego Plum, \"Growing Mold\" eschewed the skacore influence of the band's early work in favor of exploring more eclectic and experimental musical territory, resulting in a combination of sounds \"(un)Leash\" magazine described as \"like early Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo meets Dead Kennedys meets gothabilly monster mash\". While \"Growing Mold\" never reached the radar of any major music publications, the album was praised by local university papers and alternative weeklies, with UC Riversides \"Highlander\" dubbing the Chicken Heads \"one of the best bands you've probably never heard of\" and \"OC Weekly\" calling the album \"funny\" and \"amusingly campy\", while the single \"I Eat Kids\", a cover of a Barry Louis Polisar song, was selected for airplay on the nationally syndicated Dr. Demento Show.\n\nIn November 2006, the Chicken Heads made another brief appearance on national television when they were invited to perform on an episode of \"The Tyra Banks Show\" as part of an \"America's Got Talent\" spoof called \"Tyra's Got Talent\", which featured weird and unusual talent acts. According to Carrot Topp, the Chicken Heads were actually a last minute replacement for another act, an Elvis impersonator in a chicken suit called \"Elvis Poultry\", who couldn't make the shoot. The band performed the song \"Our Last Song\" before a mostly confused studio audience, ultimately losing out to John the Running Painter, a painter on a treadmill, by an audience vote of 73% to 27%.\n\nFollowing further local touring within Southern California's club circuit, the Chicken Heads self-released their third album \"Music for Mutants\" in the summer of 2008, finding the band returning to a more aggressive punk rock sound. In promotion of the album, the Chicken Heads embarked on their first national tour supporting Green Jellÿ and hard rock band Rosemary's Billygoat on what was called the \"Hollywood Freak Show\", a tour spanning nearly sixty shows in thirty states. During this tour, all three bands toured as the same amalgamated line-up of musicians, virtually changing only the costumes and lead singers between sets.\n\nAround this time, the Chicken Heads began focusing on producing music videos showcasing the band's prop work and theatricality. Between 2007 and 2010, four music videos were independently filmed for the songs \"I Looked Into the Mirror\", \"Pest Control\", \"Badd Bunny\" and \"I Eat Kids\", each one heavily featuring elaborate puppetry, costuming and cartoonish set design. This period also found the Chicken Heads receiving new exposure in low-budget horror films, recording on Count Smokulas song \"Poultrygeist\" for the soundtrack to the 2008 Troma Entertainment production \"\" and writing the theme song to the horror comedy \"Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer\", which featured stop-motion animated cameos from the band members during the film's opening credits sequence.\n\nIn 2009, the Chicken Heads released \"Poultry Uprising\", a 14-song collection of rarities and unreleased tracks dating as far back to the band's earliest years as Joe and the Chicken Heads. The same year, lead singer Carrot Topp produced a compilation album on the Chicken Heads' own label Snail Sounds Records entitled \"We're Not Kidding!\", a tribute to children's musician Barry Louis Polisar, featuring sixty artists including The Vespers, DeLeon, Rebecca Loebe, Tor Hyams, In the Audience and a duet between Polisar and the Chicken Heads. \"We're Not Kidding!\" received high praise from children's publications, winning the 2010 Parents' Choice Award.\n\nThe Chicken Heads launched an Indiegogo campaign in November 2011 to help fund production on both a 15-minute prospective television pilot based on the band's fictional exploits and the release of a DVD including music videos and a live concert performance filmed in 2008. Although the campaign ultimately failed to meet its funding goal, the band continued work on numerous projects over the next two years, filming seven more music videos for both the band's original songs, including \"Deviled Egg\", directed by Hollywood special effects artist Jim Ojala, which was highlighted on horror channel Fearnet as their \"Music Video of the Week\", and humorous punk rock covers of popular songs, most notably the Imagine Dragons Grammy Award-winning song \"Radioactive\", which was released as a single. In July 2013, the Chicken Heads self-released \"Badd Bunny Breakout\", a comedic RPG computer game based on the band's characters and mythology and featuring a soundtrack of 16-bit remixes of the group's songs.\n\nThe Chicken Heads appeared once again on national television in 2012 when they were featured on a segment of the TLC reality show \"My Crazy Obsession\" which focused on Zizi Howell, a woman obsessed with carrots. Howell was filmed going to a Chicken Heads concert at a Freak Show Wrestling event in Las Vegas, where she joined the band onstage and conducted a brief interview with Carrot Topp.\nIn December 2014, the Chicken Heads released a parody cover of Elvis Presleys \"Burning Love\", re-written as the Hanukkah-themed \"Burning Latke\". \"Heeb\", a satirical Jewish magazine, singled it out as one of the \"Worst Hanukkah Videos Of 2014\", criticizing the \"too obvious\" parody lyrics but nevertheless praising the rest of the Chicken Heads' work as \"genuinely fun\". The Chicken Heads spent most of 2015 touring sporadically, including a three-show engagement in Lima, Peru in May. The band received further international attention when Polish radio network Antyradio ranked the Chicken Heads #18 on their list of the \"Top 20 Rock and Metal Freaks\", a list of costumed and theatrical rock bands, and in 2014 \"OC Weekly\" ranked them ninth on their list of the top ten horror punk bands. In 2014 and 2015, the band appeared on KNBCs \"1st Look\" and KABC-TVs \"Eye on LA\", respectively, on local interest shows highlighting the California Institute of Abnormalarts, both of which featured the Chicken Heads performing on the venue's stage in specially-recorded segments.\n\nOn March 28, 2015, The Steve Allen Theater hosted \"The Radioactive Chicken Heads Tanksgiving Special\", a surrealist three-act comedy play featuring the music of and live accompaniment by the Chicken Heads, written and directed by composer and frequent Chicken Heads collaborator Ego Plum. Set in a dystopian alternate history where Colonel Sanders is depicted as an imperialist dictator presiding over a land where rock music is outlawed, the play follows a quartet of Chicken Head puppets who discover and subsequently learn to play rock and roll music in an attempt to overthrow Sanders' regime. In addition to the Chicken Heads, the play's cast included GWARs Hunter Jackson (as his Techno Destructo persona), Haunted Garages Dukey Flyswatter and Mike Odd of Rosemary's Billygoat and Mac Sabbath in speaking roles.\n\nOn August 14, 2017, the Chicken Heads appeared on the ABC revival of \"The Gong Show\", marking the band's second appearance on a \"Gong Show\" incarnation following 1998's \"Extreme Gong\". The band performed a cover of The Trashmens 1963 hit \"Surfin' Bird\", but were gonged after 41 seconds by guest judge Jack Black. The same day, the Chicken Heads released a music video of their recording of \"Surfin' Bird\" to YouTube.\n\nAfter several years in production, the Chicken Heads independently released their fourth album \"Tales From The Coop\" on October 13, 2017. Produced by the Chicken Heads, Dave Klein, Jeff Forrest and Star Mendoza, \"Tales From The Coop\" takes the form of a concept album centered on the band's fictional backstory and menagerie of villains, featuring musical guest appearances from Klein, Dukey Flyswatter, Dominique Lenore Persi, Count Smokula and Ronald Osbourne, as well as a songwriting co-credit by Sleepy Brown of Organized Noise.\n\nOver the last twenty years, the Chicken Heads have featured an erratic and frequently rotating line-up of musicians and instrumentalists, and have performed with as many as four to twelve musicians at a time over the course of their career. The band has sometimes included upwards of three guitarists on stage and often utilize a keyboardist and/or an accordionist, while their horn section, when present, has ranged from a three-piece ensemble of trumpet, trombone and saxophone to a single trumpet. At one point in 1998, the band even included a violinist as part of their stage show. As of 2017, the band maintains a steadier line-up of between six and eight musicians, typically featuring a trumpeter and keyboardist, along with an additional one or two members on costume accompaniment.\n\nOriginally inspired by comedy metal bands Green Jellÿ and GWAR, the Chicken Heads' first incarnation as Joe and the Chicken Heads produced their most abrasive material, boasting a sound predominantly grounded in heavy metal and hardcore and mixed with elements of ska punk and funk rock. Contemporary reviews of the band's shows drew comparisons such as \"Fishbone meets GWAR\" or \"GWAR meets The Aquabats\", while some reviewers coined unique terms like \"doom ska\" and \"chicken-doom-ska-rock\" to describe their mix of styles.\n\nFollowing their name change to The Radioactive Chicken Heads, the band began transitioning into a less thrashy and more melodic style of punk rock, emphasizing an offbeat eclectic edge inspired by the likes of The Residents and Oingo Boingo, while also expanding their sound into occasional one-off genre experiments in styles ranging from reggae to rockabilly. The Chicken Heads' 2005 album \"Growing Mold\" featured a mix of punk, rock and blues songs interspersed with accordion and marimba-driven instrumentals, while their 2008 follow-up \"Music for Mutants\" returned to an entirely punk, rock and metal-oriented sound although with an increased use of keyboards and brass instruments. The \"OC Weekly\" has described the band's current style as a cross \"between GWAR and The B-52s...a sound that might work well scoring a John Waters, Ed Wood or Russ Meyer film\", while \"Loudwire\" summarized them as \"the Dead Kennedys on acid\".\n\nLyrically, the Chicken Heads have cited song parodist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic and children's musician Barry Louis Polisar as primary influences, and incorporate a similar style of puns and absurdist humor into their songwriting. Many of the band's songs center around their fictional backstory as mutant chickens, sometimes focusing on specific band members and stage villains, or references to bird-related popular culture such as \"Headless Mike\", an ode to the 1940s carnival attraction Mike the Headless Chicken. During their \"Joe\" era, the band performed many parody versions of popular punk rock songs, including \"Put the Cheese Away (Keep It Refrigerated)\", a spoof of The Offsprings \"Come Out and Play (Keep 'Em Separated)\", and \"Just for the Taste of It\", which repurposed Rancids \"Salvation\" into a commercial jingle for Diet Coke.\n\nHaving initially originated as a comic book concept, The Radioactive Chicken Heads have maintained an elaborate fictional narrative regarding the origins and universe of their characters, detailed and expanded upon through their official press biographies, in-character interviews, song lyrics, music videos, video game and television pilot.\nThe Chicken Heads' origin stories can be separated into two distinct eras, delineated by the band's name change from \"Joe and the Chicken Heads\" into \"The Radioactive Chicken Heads\". As \"Joe and the Chicken Heads\", the group's story began on Uncle Max's farm, an otherwise normal California farm located underneath a series of high-tension electromagnetic power lines and regularly subject to government-led experiments in genetic engineering which produced massively-sized sentient vegetables, among which was the seven-foot tall carrot, Carrot Topp. Finding themselves bored with farm life, Carrot Topp and the other mutant vegetables started a punk rock band called The Vegematics, an endeavor which soon ended in tragedy when Badd Bunny, a rabbit mutated into an evil ten-ton beast by the same radiation, broke into their rehearsal space and devoured most of the members.\n\nThe following Spring, Badd Bunny sabotaged Uncle Max's annual Easter egg hunt by beating up the Easter Bunny and planting dozens of \"genetically modified super-sized-mega-jumbo eggs\" around the farm, hatching an army of gigantic mutant chickens. Max's nephew, a slightly unbalanced farmhand named Joe, saw a lucrative business opportunity and taught each of the chicken beasts how to play instruments, eventually debuting on the county fair circuit as the nation's premiere man/chicken musical combo: \"Joe and the Chicken Heads\". Ultimately, the rising tensions of \"artistic differences\" within the band drove Joe to behead his bandmates and sell their meaty bodies to an unnamed \"Colonel\", leaving Carrot Topp to save his poultry pals by taking their heads and sewing them onto an assortment of human bodies he collected from the dumpster behind the local cryogenics lab, starting a whole new band bent on rock and roll stardom.\n\nAlthough elements of the Chicken Heads' original origin story served as the basis for the 2013 video game \"Badd Bunny Breakout\", the band's official backstory was almost entirely retconned following their name change to \"The Radioactive Chicken Heads\" in 2004, completely removing the character of Joe and the setting of Uncle Max's farm. As most thoroughly detailed in \"Tales From The Coop\" and \"The Radioactive Chicken Heads Show\", Carrot Topp and the Chicken Heads are instead presented as the accidental creations of Dr. Baron Von Kluckinstein, a maniacal mad scientist conducting experiments on vegetables and poultry to make super-sized \"frankenfoods\". Kept as prisoners in his secret laboratory, the Chicken Heads eventually break out to live freely as a vegetable/poultry punk band, all the while fighting off Dr. Kluckinstein's sizable menagerie of monsters and creatures ordered to bring them back to captivity.\n\nIn a similar vein to other bands with fictionalized personas like GWAR and The Aquabats, the Chicken Heads are known for staging wild, theatrical live shows utilizing various props and costumed characters tying loosely into their thematic aesthetic. Due to the band members' attempt to retain anonymity, the Chicken Heads are rarely seen without their trademark masks and costumes and never grant interviews outside of their character personas, and thus always perform in full costume; although Carrot Topp sings while holding a dynamic microphone, a wireless headset microphone is used on the inside of his mask to provide voice clarity.\n\nEvery Chicken Heads show regularly features a host of extraneous characters outside of the main musicians, including both non-musician members who dance and interact with the audience during the band's set and \"villains\" who appear onstage to engage Carrot Topp in staged combat. These villains are mostly specific to the songs being played by the band, such as Badd Bunny and Liquid Fat appearing during their respective eponymous songs or \"Chucky Cheeze\" for \"Pest Control\", or thematically match the subject of the song, such as \"Evil Carrot\", a skeletal version of Carrot Topp, who appears during the song \"I Looked Into the Mirror\".\n\nIn addition to traditional music venues and festivals, the Chicken Heads have also performed within a wide variety of unconventional events and settings. Most notably, the band have been featured musical guests at Sinn Bodhis Freakshow Wrestling throughout California and Nevada, as well as musical lead-ins for the award-winning Los Angeles production of and select theatrical engagements of Richard Elfmans 1980 film \"Forbidden Zone\", often performing alongside Elfman himself. The Chicken Heads have also remained a common fixture at the California Institute of Abnormalarts, a North Hollywood nightclub and museum famous for its extensive sideshow and carnival memorabilia which exclusively hosts offbeat musical groups, burlesque and freak shows, having first played there in 2000 and having since been featured in the venue's numerous promotional materials and media coverage.\n\nOn July 13, 2013, the Chicken Heads, in collaboration with independent game company Patient Corgi, released \"Badd Bunny Breakout\", a role-playing computer game modeled and styled after classic Super Nintendo-era RPGs such as \"Final Fantasy\" and \"Chrono Trigger\". First announced on the band's website on September 6, 2012, \"Badd Bunny Breakout\" spent roughly a year in development, designed by Ian Luckey and Colleen Luckey with creative input by the Chicken Heads. The game was released as a free digital download on Patient Corgi's website, with a limited pressing of \"Collector's Edition\" CD-ROMs being made available through the Chicken Heads' website and live shows.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Badd Bunny Breakout\" consists primarily of SNES-inspired 16-bit remixes of the Chicken Heads' songs, composed by co-developer Ian Luckey, a member of the San Diego video game music cover band Kirby's Dream Band. A 49-track soundtrack album was packaged with the CD-ROM release and also made available for free download through both Patient Corgi's website and the Chicken Heads' Bandcamp account.\n\nIn promotion of the game, the Chicken Heads hosted and performed at a game release party at the Nerdist Theater inside Los Angeles' Meltdown Comics on the day of \"Badd Bunny Breakout\"s release, where the game was displayed for public play. The following week, the band performed a set at the 2013 Gam3rcon, an independent gaming convention which coincides with the San Diego Comic-Con International, playing to an audience of roughly 3000 attendees. The Chicken Heads subsequently performed at the 2014 and 2015 Gam3rcons, and has since shared bills with several video game-themed bands, most notably having performed several times each with The Protomen, The Megas and Mega Ran.\n\nProduction on a Radioactive Chicken Heads-themed television pilot began as early as late 2011, when the band - with video director Kyle Caraher - launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to help finance \"Behind the Mutants\", a documentary-styled short about the origins of the Chicken Heads, as well as the release of a DVD with never before seen footage. The campaign was promoted by a video interview between the series' antagonist, Dr. Baron von Kluckinstein (played by artist Thom Foolery), and actress Allison Scagliotti, though no mention was made if Scagliotti had any further involvement with the project.\n\nUltimately, the campaign only raised $1,537 of its desired $5,000 goal; though the Chicken Heads confirmed through Indiegogo that the amount was still enough to start pre-production, filming took place intermittently over a period of five years. During this time, the format of the pilot was significantly altered from its original mockumentary style into three individual segments based on the band's songs. In an Indiegogo update dated June 22, 2017, the band finally announced that principal photography was wrapped and post-production work was near completion. Throughout June and July 2017, the Chicken Heads released three promotional music videos edited together from footage from the three segments of the pilot: \"The Sky is Falling\", \"Pox\" and \"Bird Brain\".\n\nOn October 14, 2017, \"The Radioactive Chicken Heads Show\" received its world premiere as part of the OC Film Fiesta film festival in the Chicken Heads' hometown of Santa Ana, California, where several of the members appeared following the screening to host an in-character Q&A and perform a brief acoustic set. The next week, the pilot was screened as part of the Planet 9 Film Festival at the California Institute of Abnormalarts in North Hollywood, where it was also accompanied by an acoustic set by the Chicken Heads. Finally, the pilot was released to YouTube in individual segments on November 21 (\"Bird Brain\"), December 23 (\"Pox\") and January 22, 2018 (\"The Sky is Falling\"). As of 2018, there has been no official announcement as to whether or not further episodes will be filmed.\n\nThe following is a list of segments which, as of January 2018, comprise the episodes of \"The Radioactive Chicken Heads Show\":\n\nSince their original inception, the Chicken Heads have preferred to operate under complete anonymity, presenting themselves as a band of specific characters rather than costumed musicians; as such, there are no real names publicly attributed to the band members past or present, instead only the characters they portray. However, over the course of their decades-long career as a band, the Chicken Heads have experienced countless fluctuations in their typically five to ten-member line-up, and thus different characters play or used to play different instruments than the ones listed below.\n\nThe following roster reflects the Chicken Heads' current line-up as of 2017, according to both the liner notes of \"Tales From The Coop\" and subsequent updates to their official social media, while the timelines are those of the characters rather than the musician(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17380298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17380298", "title": "Robert Mugabe", "text": "Robert Mugabe\n\nRobert Gabriel Mugabe (; ; born 21 February 1924) is a Zimbabwean revolutionary and politician who served as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1987 and then as President from 1987 to 2017. He chaired the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) group from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party, the ZANU – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF), from 1980 to 2017. Ideologically an African nationalist, during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a Marxist–Leninist, although after the 1990s self-identified only as a socialist. His policies have been described as Mugabeism.\nMugabe was born to a poor Shona family in Kutama, Southern Rhodesia. Following an education at Kutama College and the University of Fort Hare, he worked as a school teacher in Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Ghana. Angered that Southern Rhodesia was a British colony governed by a white minority, Mugabe embraced Marxism and joined African nationalist protests calling for an independent black-led state. After making anti-government comments, he was convicted of sedition and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. On release, he fled to Mozambique, established his leadership of ZANU, and oversaw ZANU's role in the Rhodesian Bush War, fighting Ian Smith's predominantly white government. He reluctantly took part in the peace negotiations brokered by the United Kingdom that resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement. The agreement dismantled the short-lived Zimbabwe Rhodesia and resulted in the 1980 general election, at which Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory. Mugabe's administration expanded healthcare and education and—despite his Marxist rhetoric and professed desire for a socialist society—adhered largely to mainstream, conservative economic policies. His calls for racial reconciliation failed to stem growing white flight.\nRelations with Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) declined, with Mugabe's government crushing ZAPU-linked opposition in Matabeleland during the Gukurahundi between 1982 and 1985; at least 10,000 people, mostly Ndebele civilians, were killed by Mugabe's Fifth Brigade. Internationally, he sent troops into the Second Congo War and chaired the Non-Aligned Movement (1986–89), the Organisation of African Unity (1997–98), and the African Union (2015–16). Pursuing decolonisation, Mugabe emphasised the redistribution of land controlled by white farmers to landless blacks, initially on a \"willing seller-willing buyer\" basis. Frustrated at the slow rate of redistribution, from 2000 he encouraged the violent seizure of white-owned land. Food production was severely impacted, leading to famine, drastic economic decline, and international sanctions. Opposition to Mugabe grew, although he was re-elected in 2002, 2008, and 2013 through campaigns dominated by violence, electoral fraud, and nationalistic appeals to his rural Shona voter base. In 2017, members of his own party ousted him in a coup, replacing him with former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\nHaving dominated Zimbabwe's politics for nearly four decades, Mugabe has been a controversial and divisive figure. He has been praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped to free Zimbabwe from British colonialism, imperialism and white minority rule. Conversely, he has been accused of being a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, widespread corruption, anti-white racism, human rights abuses and crimes against humanity.\n\nRobert Gabriel Mugabe was born on 21 February 1924 at the Kutama Mission village in Southern Rhodesia's Zvimba District. His father, Gabriel Matibiri, was a carpenter while his mother Bona taught Christian catechism to the village children. They had been trained in their professions by the Jesuits, the Roman Catholic apostolic order which had established the mission. Bona and Gabriel had six children: Miteri (Michael), Raphael, Robert, Dhonandhe (Donald), Sabina, and Bridgette. They belonged to the Zezuru clan, one of the smallest branches of the Shona tribe. Mugabe's paternal grandfather was Constantine Karigamombe, alias \"Matibiri\", a strong powerful figure, who served King Lobengula in the 19th century. The Jesuits were strict disciplinarians and under their influence Mugabe developed an intense self-discipline, while also becoming a devout Catholic. Mugabe excelled at school, where he was a secretive and solitary child, preferring to read alone rather than playing sport or socialising with other children. He was taunted by many of the other children, who regarded him as a coward and a mother's boy.\n\nCirca 1930, Gabriel had an argument with one of the Jesuits, and as a result the Mugabe family were expelled from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubiere. They settled in a village about seven miles away, although the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living with relatives in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home at weekends. Around the same time, Robert's older brother Raphael died, likely of diarrhoea. In early 1934, Robert's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned maize. Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment at Bulawayo. He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring.\n\nLoubiere died shortly after and was replaced by an Irishman, Father Jerome O'Hea, who welcomed the Mugabe family to return to Kutama. In contrast to the racism that permeated Southern Rhodesian society, under O'Hea's leadership the Kutama Mission preached an ethos of racial equality. O'Hea nurtured the young Mugabe; shortly before his death in 1970 he described the latter as having \"an exceptional mind and an exceptional heart\". As well as helping provide Mugabe with a Christian education, O'Hea taught him about the Irish War of Independence, in which Irish revolutionaries had overthrown the British imperial regime. After completing six years of elementary education, in 1941 Mugabe was offered a place on a teacher training course at Kutama College; Mugabe's mother could not afford the tuition fees, which were paid in part by his grandfather and in part by O'Hea. As part of this education, Mugabe began teaching at his old school, thus earning £2 per month, which he used to support his family. In 1944, Gabriel returned to Kutama with his three new children, but died shortly after, leaving Robert to take financial responsibility for both his three siblings and three half-siblings. Having attained a teaching diploma, Mugabe left Kutama in 1945.\n\nOver the following years, Mugabe taught at various schools around Southern Rhodesia, among them the Dadaya Mission school in Shabani. There is no evidence that Mugabe was involved in political activity at the time, and did not participate in the country's 1948 general strike. In 1949 he won a scholarship to study at the University of Fort Hare in South Africa's Eastern Cape. There he joined the African National Congress, and attended African nationalist meetings, where he met a number of Jewish South African communists who introduced him to Marxist ideas. He later related that despite this exposure to Marxism, his biggest influence at the time were the actions of Mahatma Gandhi during the Indian independence movement. In 1952, he left the university with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English literature. In later years he described his time at Fort Hare as the \"turning-point\" in his life.\nMugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia in 1952, by which time—he later related— he was \"completely hostile to the [colonialist] system\". Here, his first job was as a teacher at the Driefontein Roman Catholic Mission School near Umvuma. In 1953 he relocated to the Highfield Government School in Salisbury's Harari township and in 1954 to the Mambo Township Government School in Gwelo. Meanwhile, he gained a Bachelor of Education degree by correspondence from the University of South Africa, and ordered a number of Marxist tracts—among them Karl Marx's \"\" and Friedrich Engels' \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\"—from a London mail-order company. Despite his growing interest in politics, he was not active in any political movement. He joined a number of inter-racial groups, such as the Capricorn Africa Society, through which he mixed with both black and white Rhodesians. Guy Clutton-Brock, who knew Mugabe through this group, later noted that he was \"an extraordinary young man\" who could be \"a bit of a cold fish at times\" but \"could talk about Elvis Presley or Bing Crosby as easily as politics\".\n\nFrom 1955 to 1958, Mugabe lived in neighbouring Northern Rhodesia, where he worked at Chalimbana Teacher Training College in Lusaka. There he continued his education by working on a second degree by correspondence, this time a Bachelor of Administration from the University of London International Programmes through distance and learning. In Northern Rhodesia, he was taken in for a time by the family of Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom Mugabe inspired to join the liberation movement and who would later go on to be President of Zimbabwe. In 1958, Mugabe moved to Ghana to work at St Mary's Teacher Training College in Takoradi. He taught at Apowa Secondary School, also at Takoradi, after obtaining his local certification at Achimota College (1958–1960), where he met his first wife, Sally Hayfron. According to Mugabe, \"I went [to Ghana] as an adventurist. I wanted to see what it would be like in an independent African state\". Ghana had been the first African state to gain independence from European colonial powers and under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah underwent a range of African nationalist reforms; Mugabe revelled in this environment. In tandem with his teaching, Mugabe attended the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute in Winneba. Mugabe later claimed that it was in Ghana that he finally embraced Marxism. He also began a relationship with a Ghanaian woman, Sally Hayfron, who worked at the college and shared his political interests.\n\nWhile Mugabe was teaching abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement was established in Southern Rhodesia. This was first led by Joshua Nkomo's Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, founded in September 1957 and then banned by the colonial government in February 1959. This was replaced by the more radically oriented National Democratic Party (NDP), founded in January 1960. In May 1960, Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him. The pair had planned for their visit to be short, however Mugabe's friend, the African nationalist Leopold Takawira, urged them to stay.\n\nIn July 1960, Takawira and two other NDP officials were arrested; in protest, Mugabe joined a demonstration of 7,000 people who planned to march from Highfield to the Prime Minister's office in Salisbury. The demonstration was stopped by riot police outside Stoddart Hall in Harare township. By midday the next day, the crowd had grown to 40,000 and a makeshift platform had been erected for speakers. Having become a much-respected figure through his profession, his possession of three degrees, and his travels abroad, Mugabe was among those invited to speak to the crowd. Following this event, Mugabe decided to devote himself full-time to activism, resigning his teaching post in Ghana (after having served two years of the four-year teaching contract). He chaired the first NDP congress, held in October 1960, assisted by Chitepo on the procedural aspects. Mugabe was elected the party's publicity secretary. Mugabe consciously injected emotionalism into the NDP's African nationalism, hoping to broaden its support among the wider population by appealing to traditional cultural values. He helped to form the NDP Youth Wing and encouraged the incorporation of ancestral prayers, traditional costume, and female ululation into its meetings. In February 1961 he married Hayfron in a Roman Catholic ceremony conducted in Salisbury; she had converted to Catholicism to make this possible.\n\nThe British government held a Salisbury conference in 1961 to determine Southern Rhodesia's future. Nkomo led an NDP delegation, which hoped that the British would support the creation of an independent state governed by the black majority. Representatives of the country's white minority—who then controlled Southern Rhodesia's government—were opposed to this, promoting continued white minority rule. Following negotiations, Nkomo agreed to a proposal which would allow the black population representation through 15 of the 65 seats in the country's parliament. Mugabe and others in the NDP were furious at Nkomo's compromise. Following the conference, Southern Rhodesia's African nationalist movement fell into disarray. Mugabe spoke at a number of NDP rallies before the party was banned by the government in December 1961. Many of its members re-grouped as the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) several days later, with Mugabe appointed as ZAPU's publicity secretary and general secretary.\n\nRacial violence was growing in the country, with aggrieved black Africans targeting the white community. Mugabe deemed such conflict a necessary tactic in the overthrow of British colonial dominance and white minority rule. This contrasted with Nkomo's view that African nationalists should focus on international diplomacy to encourage the British government to grant their demands. Nine months after it had been founded, ZAPU was also banned by the government, and in September 1962 Mugabe and other senior party officials were arrested and restricted to their home districts for three months. Both Mugabe and his wife were in trouble with the law; he had been charged with making subversive statements in a public speech and awarded bail before his trial. Hayfron had been sentenced to two years imprisonment—suspended for 15 months—for a speech in which she declared that the British Queen Elizabeth II \"can go to hell\".\n\nThe rise of African nationalism generated a white backlash in Southern Rhodesia, with the right-wing Rhodesian Front winning the December 1962 general election. The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full independence from the United Kingdom. Mugabe met with colleagues at his house in Salisbury's Highbury district, where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned, it was time to move towards armed resistance. Both he and others rejected Nkomo's proposal that they establish a government-in-exile in Dar es Salaam. He and Hayfron skipped bail to attend a ZAPU meeting in the Tanganyikan city. There, the party leadership met Tanganyika's President, Julius Nyerere, who also dismissed the idea of a government-in-exile and urged ZAPU to organise their resistance to white minority rule within Southern Rhodesia itself.\n\nIn August, Hayfron gave birth to Mugabe's son, whom they named Nhamodzenyika, a Shona term meaning \"suffering country\". Mugabe insisted that she take their son back to Ghana, while he decided to return to Southern Rhodesia. There, African nationalists opposed to Nkomo's leadership had established a new party, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), in August; Ndabaningi Sithole became the group's president, while appointing Mugabe to be the group's secretary-general \"in absentia\". Nkomo responded by forming his own group, the People's Caretaker Council, which was widely referred to as \"ZAPU\" after its predecessor. ZAPU and ZANU violently opposed one another and soon gang warfare broke out between their rival memberships.\n\nMugabe was arrested on his return to Southern Rhodesia in December 1963. His trial lasted from January to March 1964, during which he refused to retract the subversive statements that he had publicly made. In March 1964 he was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment. Mugabe was first imprisoned at Salisbury Maximum Security Prison, before being moved to the Wha Wha detention centre and then the Sikombela detention centre in Que Que. At the latter, he organised study classes for the inmates, teaching them basic literacy, maths, and English. Sympathetic black warders smuggled messages from Mugabe and other members of the ZANU executive committee to activists outside the prison. At the executive's bidding, ZANU activist Herbert Chitepo had organised a small guerrilla force in Lusaka. In April 1966 it carried out a failed attempt to destroy power pylons at Sinoia, and shortly after attacked a white-owned farm near Hartley, killing its inhabitants. The government responded by returning the members of the ZANU executive, including Mugabe, to Salisbury Prison in 1966. There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping on the concrete floor due to overcrowding; Mugabe shared his cell with Sithole, Enos Nkala, and Edgar Tekere. He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying. During this period he gained several further degrees from the University of London: a masters in economics, a bachelor of administration, and two law degrees.\nWhile imprisoned, Mugabe learned that his son had died of encephalitis at the age of three. Mugabe was grief-stricken and requested a leave of absence to visit his wife in Ghana. He never forgave the prison authorities for refusing this request. Claims have also circulated among those who knew him at the time that Mugabe was subjected to both physical and mental torture during his imprisonment. According to Father Emmanuel Ribeiro, who was Mugabe's priest during his imprisonment, Mugabe got through the experience \"partly through the strength of his spirituality\" but also because his \"real strength was study and helping others to learn\".\n\nWhile Mugabe was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government—now under the leadership of Ian Smith—banned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement. Smith's government made a unilateral declaration of independence from the United Kingdom in November 1965, renaming Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia; the UK refused to recognise the legitimacy of this and imposed economic sanctions on the country.\n\nIn 1972, the African nationalists launched a guerrilla war against Smith's government. Among the revolutionaries, it was known as the \"Second Chimurenga\". Paramilitary groups based themselves in neighbouring Tanzania and Zambia, although many of their fighters were inadequately armed and trained. ZANU's military wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), consisted largely of Shona. It was based in neighbouring Mozambique and gained funds from the People's Republic of China. ZAPU's military wing, the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), was instead funded by the Soviet Union, was based in Zambia, and consisted largely of Ndebele.\n\nMugabe and other senior ZANU members had growing doubts about Sithole's leadership, deeming him increasingly irritable and irrational. In October 1968 Sithole had tried to smuggle a message out of the prison commanding ZANU activists to assassinate Smith. His plan was discovered and he was put on trial in January 1969; desperate to avoid a death sentence, he declared that he renounced violence and his previous ideological commitments. Mugabe denounced Sithole's \"treachery\" in rejecting ZANU's cause, and the executive removed him as ZANU President in a vote of no confidence, selecting Mugabe as his successor. In November 1974, the ZANU executive voted to suspend Sithole's membership of the organisation.\n\nFearing that the guerrilla war would spread south, the South African government pressured Rhodesia to advance the process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina at her home in Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.\n\nIn March 1975, Mugabe resolved to leave Rhodesia for Mozambique, ambitious to take control of ZANU's guerrilla campaign. After his friend Maurice Nyagumbo was arrested, he feared the same fate but was hidden from the authorities by Ribeiro. Ribeiro and a sympathetic nun then assisted him and Edgar Tekere in smuggling themselves into Mozambique. Mugabe remained in exile there for two years. Mozambique's Marxist President Samora Machel was sceptical of Mugabe's leadership abilities and was unsure whether to recognise him as ZANU's legitimate leader. Machel gave him a house in Quelimane although kept him under partial house arrest, with Mugabe requiring permission to travel. It would be almost a year before Machel accepted Mugabe's leadership of ZANU.\n\nMugabe travelled to various ZANLA camps in Mozambique to build support among its officers. By mid-1976, he had secured the allegiance of ZANLA's military commanders and established himself as the most prominent guerrilla leader battling Smith's regime. In August 1977, he was officially declared ZANU President at a meeting of the party's central committee held in Chimoio. \nDuring the war, Mugabe remained suspicious of many of ZANLA's commanders and had a number of them imprisoned. In 1977 he imprisoned his former second-in-command, Wilfred Mhanda, for suspected disloyalty. After Tongogara was killed in a car accident in 1979, there were suggestions made that Mugabe may have had some involvement in it, although these rumours were never substantiated.\n\nMugabe remained aloof from the day-to-day military operations of ZANLA, which he entrusted to Josiah Tongogara. In January 1976, ZANLA launched its first major infiltration from Mozambique, with nearly 1000 guerrillas crossing the border to attack white-owned farms and stores. In response, Smith's government enlisted all men under the age of 35, expanding the Rhodesian army by 50%. ZANLA's attacks forced large numbers of white landowners to abandon their farms; their now-unemployed black workers joined ZANLA in their thousands. By 1979, ZANLA were in a position to attack a number of Rhodesian cities. Over the course of the war, at least 30,000 people were killed. As a proportion of their wider population, the whites lost a higher number of fatalities, and by the latter part of the decade the guerrillas were winning.\nMugabe focused on the propaganda war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts. In these, he presented himself as a Marxist-Leninist, speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Fidel Castro. Despite his Marxist views, Mugabe's meetings with Soviet representatives were unproductive, for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle. His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions. He also sought support from Western nations, visiting Western embassies in Mozambique, and travelled to both Western states like Italy and Switzerland and Marxist-governed states like the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.\n\nMugabe called for the overthrow of Rhodesia's predominantly white government, the execution of Smith and his \"criminal gang\", the expropriation of white-owned land, and the transformation of Rhodesia into a one-party Marxist state. He repeatedly called for violence against the country's white minority, referring to white Rhodesians as \"blood-sucking exploiters\", \"sadistic killers\", and \"hard-core racists\". In one typical example, taken from a 1978 radio address, Mugabe declared: \"Let us hammer [the white man] to defeat. Let us blow up his citadel. Let us give him no time to rest. Let us chase him in every corner. Let us rid our home of this settler vermin\". For Mugabe, armed struggle was an essential part of the establishment of a new state. In contrast to other black nationalist leaders like Nkomo, Mugabe opposed a negotiated settlement with Smith's government. In October 1976 ZANU nevertheless established a joint-platform with ZAPU known as the Patriotic Front.\nIn September 1978 Mugabe met with Nkomo in Lusaka. He was angry with the latter's secret attempts to negotiate with Smith.\n\nUnder pressure from South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, Smith accepted in principle that white minority rule could not be prolonged indefinitely. He oversaw the 1979 general election which resulted in Abel Muzorewa, a politically moderate black bishop, being elected Prime Minister of the reconstituted Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Both ZANU and ZAPU had boycotted the election, which did not receive international recognition. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979, held in Lusaka, the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher surprised delegates by announcing that the UK would officially recognise the country's independence if it transitioned to democratic majority rule.\nThe negotiations took place at Lancaster House in London and were led by the Conservative Party politician Peter Carington. Mugabe refused to attend these London peace talks, opposing the idea of a negotiated as opposed to military solution to the Rhodesian War. Machel insisted that he must, threatening to end Mozambican support for the ZANU-PF if he did not. Mugabe arrived in London in September 1979. There, he and Nkomo presented themselves as part of the \"Patriotic Front\" but established separate headquarters in the city. At the conference the pair were divided in their attitude; Nkomo wanted to present himself as a moderate while Mugabe played up to his image as a Marxist revolutionary, with Carington exploiting this division. Throughout the negotiations, Mugabe did not trust the British and believed that they were manipulating events to their own advantage.\n\nThe Lancaster House Agreement called for all participants in the Rhodesian Bush War to agree to a ceasefire, with a British governor, Christopher Soames, arriving in Rhodesia to oversee an election in which the various factions could compete as political parties. It outlined a plan for a transition to formal independence as a sovereign republic under black-majority rule, also maintaining that Rhodesia would be renamed Zimbabwe, a name adopted from the Iron Age archaeological site of Great Zimbabwe. The agreement also ensured that the country's white minority retained many of its economic and political privileges, with 20 seats to be reserved for whites in the new Parliament. By insisting on the need for a democratic black majority government, Carington was able to convince Mugabe to compromise on the other main issue of the conference, that of land ownership. Mugabe agreed to the protection of the white community's privately owned property on the condition that the UK and US governments provide financial assistance allowing the Zimbabwean government to purchase much land for redistribution among blacks. \nMugabe was opposed to the idea of a ceasefire, but under pressure from Machel he agreed to it. Mugabe signed the agreement, although felt cheated, remaining disappointed that he had never achieved a military victory over the Rhodesian forces.\n\nReturning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe was greeted by a supportive crowd. He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb. Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any white flight after the election would cause economic damage as it had in Mozambique. Accordingly, during his electoral campaign Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric. Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting. He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). Predictions were made that ZANU-PF would win the election on the basis of the country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%. For many in the white community and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.\nDuring the campaign, Mugabe survived two assassination attempts. In the first, which took place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden wall. In the second, on 10 February, a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade as he left a Fort Victoria rally. Mugabe himself was unharmed. Mugabe accused the Rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks. In an attempt to quell the possibility that Rhodesia's security forces would launch a coup to prevent the election, Mugabe met with Peter Walls, the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, and asked him to remain in his position in the event of a ZANU-PF victory. At the time Walls refused.\n\nThe electoral campaign was marred by widespread voter intimidation, perpetrated by Nkomo's ZAPU, Abel Muzorewa's United African National Council (UANC), and Mugabe's ZANU-PF. Commenting on ZANU-PF's activities in eastern Rhodesia, Nkomo complained that \"the word \"intimidation\" is mild. People are being terrorised. It is \"terror\".\" Reacting to ZANU-PF's acts of voter intimidation, Mugabe was called before Soames at Government House. Mugabe regarded the meeting as a British attempt to thwart his electoral campaign. Under the terms of the negotiation, Soames had the power to disqualify any political party guilty of voter intimidation. Rhodesia's security services, Nkomo, Muzorewa, and some of his own advisers all called on Soames to disqualify ZANU-PF. After deliberation, Soames disagreed, believing that ZANU-PF were sure to win the election and that disqualifying them would wreck any chance of an orderly transition of power.\n\nIn the February election, ZANU-PF secured 63% of the national vote, gaining 57 of the 80 parliamentary seats allocated for black parties and providing them with an absolute majority. ZAPU had gained 20 seats, and UANC had three. Mugabe was elected MP for the Salisbury constituency of Highfield. Attempting to calm panic and prevent white flight, Mugabe appeared on television and called for national unity, stability, and law and order, insisting that the pensions of white civil servants would be guaranteed and that private property would be protected.\n\nMugabe took his oath of office on 17 April 1980. He gave a speech at Salisbury's Rufaro Stadium announcing that Rhodesia would be renamed \"Zimbabwe\" and pledged racial reconciliation. Soames aided Mugabe in bringing about an orderly transition of power; for this Mugabe remained grateful, describing Soames as a good friend. Mugabe unsuccessfully urged Soames to remain in Zimbabwe for several more years, and also failed to convince the UK to assume a two-year \"guiding role\" for his government because most ZANU-PF members lacked experience in governing. Although ZANU-PF's absolute parliamentary majority allowed them to rule alone, Mugabe created a government of national unity by inviting members of rival parties to join his cabinet. Mugabe moved into the Premier's residence in Salisbury, which he left furnished in the same style as Smith had left it.\n\nAcross the country, statues of Cecil Rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after prominent colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists. In 1982 Salisbury was renamed Harare. Mugabe employed North Korean architects to design Heroes' Acre, a monument and complex in western Harare to commemorate the struggle against minority rule. Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that a stable and prosperous Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule. The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25 million three-year aid package. The UK financed a land reform program, and provided military advisers to aid the integration of the guerrilla armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a new Zimbabwean military. Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army, although there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups. As Prime Minister, Mugabe retained Walls as the head of the armed forces.\n\nMugabe's government continued to make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, although did not take concrete steps in that direction. In contrast to Mugabe's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment. In office, Mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions. From 1980 to 1990, the country's economy grew by an average of 2.7% a year, but this was outstripped by population growth and real income declined. The unemployment rate rose, reaching 26% in 1990. The government ran a budget deficit year-on-year that averaged at 10% of the country's gross domestic product. Under Mugabe's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending. In 1980, Zimbabwe had just 177 secondary schools, by 2000 this number had risen to 1,548. During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the best records in Africa. Levels of child immunisation were raised from 25% of the population to 92%.\n\nA new leadership elite were formed, who often expressed their newfound status through purchasing large houses and expensive cars, sending their children to private schools, and obtaining farms and businesses. To contain their excesses, in 1984 Mugabe drew up a \"leadership code\" which prohibited any senior figures from obtaining more than one salary or owning over 50-acres of agricultural land. There were exceptions, with Mugabe giving permission to General Solomon Mujuru to expand his business empire, resulting in him becoming one of the Zimbabwe's wealthiest people. Growing corruption among the socio-economic elite generated resentment among the wider population, much of which was living in poverty.\nZANU-PF also sought to establish its own business empire, founding the M&S Syndicate in 1980 and the Zidoo Holdings in 1981. By 1992, the party had fixed assets and businesses worth an estimated Z$500 million (US$75 million). In 1980, ZANU-PF used Nigerian funds to set up the Mass Media Trust, through which they bought out a South African company that owned most of Zimbabwe's newspapers. The white editors of these newspapers were sacked and replaced by government appointees. These media outlets subsequently became a source of the party's propaganda.\n\nAt independence, 39% of Zimbabwe's land was under the ownership of around 6000 white large-scale commercial farmers, while 4% was owned by black small-scale commercial farmers, and 41% was 'communal land' where 4 million people lived, often in overcrowded conditions. The Lancaster House agreement ensured that until 1990, the sale of land could only take place on a \"willing seller-willing buyer\" basis. The only permitted exceptions were if the land was \"underutilised\" or needed for a public purpose, in which case the government could compulsorily purchase it while fully compensating the owner. This meant that Mugabe's government was largely restricted to purchasing land which was of poor quality. Its targets was to resettle 18,000 black families on 2.5 million acres of white-owned land over three years. This would cost £30 million (US$60 million), half of which was to be provided by the UK government as per the Lancaster House Agreement.\n\nIn 1986, Mugabe became chair of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a position that he retained until 1989. As the leader of one of the Front Line States, the countries bordering apartheid South Africa, he gained credibility within the anti-apartheid movement.\n\nMugabe initially emphasised racial reconciliation and he was keen to build a good relationship with white Zimbabweans. He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property. He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government, met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity. With the end of the war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved during the early years of Mugabe's regime. In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.\n\nNevertheless, many white Zimbabweans complained that they were the victims of racial discrimination. Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children would be unable to secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 17,000 whites—approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population—emigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.\nIn December 1981, a bomb struck ZANU-PF headquarters, killing seven and injuring 124. Mugabe blamed South African-backed white militants. He criticised \"reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements\" in the white community, stating that despite the fact that they had faced no punishment for their past actions, they rejected racial reconciliation and \"are acting in collusion with South Africa to harm our racial relations, to destroy our unity, to sabotage our economy, and to overthrow the popularly elected government I lead\". Increasingly he criticised not only the militants but the entire white community for holding a monopoly on \"Zimbabwe's economic power\". This was a view echoed by many government ministers and the government-controlled media. One of these ministers, Tekere, was involved in an incident in which he and seven armed men stormed a white-owned farmhouse, killing an elderly farmer; they alleged that in doing so they were foiling a coup attempt. Tekere was acquitted of murder although Mugabe dropped him from the cabinet.\n\nRacial mistrust and suspicion continued to grow. In December 1981, the elderly white MP Wally Stuttaford was accused of being a South African agent, arrested, and tortured, generating anger among whites. In July 1982, South African-backed white militants destroyed 13 aircraft at Thornhill. A number of white military officers were accused of complicity, arrested, and tortured. They were put on trial but cleared by judges, after which they were immediately re-arrested. Their case generated an international outcry, which Mugabe criticised, stating that the case only gained such attention because the accused were white. His defence of torture and contempt for legal procedures damaged his international standing. White flight continued to grow, and within three years of Mugabe's Premiership half of all white Zimbabweans had emigrated. In the 1985 election, Smith's Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe won 15 of the 20 seats allocated for white Zimbabweans. Mugabe was outraged by this result, lambasting white Zimbabweans for not repenting \"in any way\" by continuing to support Smith and other white politicians who had committed \"horrors against the people of Zimbabwe\".\n\nUnder the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a ceremonial role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana. Mugabe had previously offered the position to Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs. Although working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo. Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more. In contrast, some ZANU-PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state. Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly adamant that there should be a crackdown on ZAPU. After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes between the two parties broke out in the city.\n\nIn January 1981, Mugabe demoted Nkomo in a cabinet reshuffle; the latter warned that this would anger ZAPU supporters. In February, violence between ZAPU and ZANU-PF supporters broke out among the battalion stationed at Ntabazindune, soon spreading to other army bases, resulting in 300 deaths. An arms cache featuring land mines and anti-aircraft missiles were then discovered at Ascot Farm, which was part-owned by Nkomo. Mugabe cited this as evidence that ZAPU were plotting a coup, an allegation that Nkomo denied. Likening Nkomo to \"a cobra in the house\", Mugabe sacked him from the government, and ZAPU-owned businesses, farms, and properties were seized.\n\nMembers of both ZANLA and ZIPRA had deserted their positions and engaged in banditry. In Matabeleland, ZIPRA deserters who came to be known as \"dissenters\" engaged in robbery, holding up buses, and attacking farm houses, creating an environment of growing lawlessness. These dissidents received support from South Africa through its Operation Mute, by which it hoped to further destabilise Zimbabwe. The government often conflated ZIPRA with the dissenters, although Nkomo denounced the dissidents and their South African supporters. Mugabe authorised the police and army to crack down on the Matabeleland dissenters, declaring that state officers would be granted legal immunity for any \"extra-legal\" actions they may perform while doing so. During 1982 he had established the Fifth Brigade, an elite armed force trained by the North Koreans; membership was drawn largely from Shona-speaking ZANLA soldiers and were answerable directly to Mugabe. In January 1983, the Fifth Brigade were deployed in the region, overseeing a campaign of beatings, arson, public executions, and massacres of those accused of being sympathetic to the dissidents. The scale of the violence was greater than that witnessed in the Rhodesian War. Interrogation centres were established where people were tortured. Mugabe acknowledged that civilians would be persecuted in the violence, claiming that \"we can't tell who is a dissident and who is not\". The ensuing events became known as the \"Gukurahundi\", a Shona word meaning \"wind that sweeps away the chaff before the rains\".\nIn 1984 the Gukurahundi spread to Matabelelend South, an area then in its third year of drought. The Fifth Brigade closed all stores, halted all deliveries, and imposed a curfew, exacerbating starvation for a period of two months. The Bishop of Bulawayo accused Mugabe of overseeing a project of systematic starvation. When a Roman Catholic delegation provided Mugabe with a dossier listing atrocities committed by the Fifth Brigade, Mugabe refuted all its allegations and accused the clergy of being disloyal to Zimbabwe. He had the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe's suppressed. In 1985, an Amnesty International report on the Gukurahundi was dismissed by Mugabe as \"a heap of lies\". Over the course of four years, approximately 10,000 civilians had been killed, and many others had been beaten and tortured. Genocide Watch later estimated that approximately 20,000 had been killed.\n\nMargaret Thatcher's UK government was aware of the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger Mugabe and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans. The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President Ronald Reagan welcoming Mugabe to the White House in September 1983. In October 1983, Mugabe attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi, where no participating states mentioned the Gukurahundi. In 2000, Mugabe acknowledged that the mass killings had happened, stating that it was \"an act of madness ... it was wrong and both sides were to blame\". Meredith argued however that Mugabe and his ZANU-PF were solely to blame for the massacres. Various Mugabe biographers have seen the Gukurahundi as a deliberate attempt to eliminate ZAPU and its support base to advance his desire for a ZANU-PF one-party state.\n\nThere was further violence in the build-up to the 1985 election, with ZAPU supporters facing harassment from ZANU-PF Youth Brigades. Despite this intimidation, ZAPU won all 15 of the parliamentary seats in Matabeleland. Mugabe then appointed Nkala as the new police minister. Nkala subsequently detained over 100 ZAPU officials, including five of its MPs and the Mayor of Bulawayo, banned the party from holding rallies or meetings, closed all of their offices, and dissolved all of the district councils that they controlled. To avoid further violence, in December 1987 Nkomo signed a Unity Accord in which ZAPU was officially disbanded and its leadership merged into ZANU-PF. The merger between the two parties left ZANU-PF with 99 of the 100 seats in parliament, and established Zimbabwe as a \"de facto\" one-party state.\n\nIn late 1987, Zimbabwe's parliament amended the constitution. On 30 December it declared Mugabe to be executive President, a new position that combined the roles of head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. This position gave him the power to dissolve parliament, declare martial law, and run for an unlimited number of terms. According to his biographer Martin Meredith, Mugabe now had \"a virtual stranglehold on government machinery and unlimited opportunities to exercise patronage\". The constitutional amendments also abolished the twenty parliamentary seats reserved for white representatives, and left parliament less relevant and independent.\n\nIn the build-up to the 1990 election, parliamentary reforms increased the number of seats to 120; of these, twenty were to be appointed by the President and ten by the Council of Chiefs. This measure made it more difficult for any opposition to Mugabe to gain a parliamentary majority. The main opposition party in that election were the Zimbabwe Unity Movement (ZUM), launched in April 1989 by Tekere; although a longstanding friend of Mugabe, Tekere accused him of betraying the revolution and establishing a dictatorship. ZANU-PF propaganda made threats against those considering voting ZUM in the election; one television advert featured images of a car crash with the statement \"This is one way to die. Another is to vote ZUM. Don't commit suicide, vote ZANU-PF and live.\" In the election, Mugabe was re-elected President with nearly 80% of the vote, while ZANU-PF secured 116 of the 119 available parliamentary seats.\n\nAlthough Mugabe had long hoped to convert Zimbabwe into a one-party state, in 1990 he officially \"postponed\" these plans as both Mozambique and many Eastern Bloc states transitioned from one-party states to multi-party republics. Following the collapse of the Marxist-Leninist regimes in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, in 1991 ZANU-PF removed references to \"Marxism-Leninism\" and \"scientific socialism\" in its material, although Mugabe maintained that \"socialism remains our sworn ideology\". That year, Mugabe pledged himself to free market economics and accepted a structural adjustment programme provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This economic reform package called for Zimbabwe to privatise state assets and reduce import tariffs; Mugabe's government implemented some although not all of its recommendations. The reforms encouraged employers to cut their wages, generating growing opposition from the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions.\nBy 1990, 52,000 black families had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient to deal with the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 black families on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.\n\nConcerns about the proposed measure—particularly its denial of the right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.\n\nIn January 1992, Mugabe's wife died. In April 1995, \"Horizon\" magazine revealed that Mugabe had secretly been having an affair with his secretary Grace Marufu since 1987 and that she had borne him a son and a daughter. His secret revealed, Mugabe decided to hold a much-publicised wedding. 12,000 people were invited to the August 1996 ceremony, which took place in Kutama and was orchestrated by the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe, Patrick Chakaipa. The ceremony was controversial among the Catholic community because of the adulterous nature of Mugabe and Marufu's relationship. To house his family, Mugabe then built a new mansion at Borrowdale. In the 1995 parliamentary election—which saw a low turnout of 31.7%—ZANU-PF gained 147 out of 150 seats. Following the election, Mugabe expanded his cabinet from 29 to 42 ministers while the government adopted a 133% pay rise for MPs.\n\nOver the course of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy steadily deteriorated. By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled. By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50%. As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans—the greater part of the nation's skilled workforce—had left the country. In 1997 there were growing demands for pensions from those who had fought for the guerrilla armies in the revolutionary war, and in August 1997 Mugabe put together a pension package that would cost the county ZD 4.2 billion. To finance this pension scheme, Mugabe's government proposed new taxes, but a general strike was called in protest in December 1997; amid protest from ZANU-PF itself, Mugabe's government abandoned the taxes. In January 1998, riots about lack of access to food broke out in Harare; the army was deployed to restore order, with at least ten killed and hundreds injured.\n\nMugabe increasingly blamed the country's economic problems on Western nations and the white Zimbabwean minority, who still controlled most of its commercial agriculture, mines, and manufacturing industry. He called on supporters \"to strike fear in the hearts of the white man, our real enemy\", and accused his black opponents of being dupes of the whites. Amid growing internal opposition to his government, he remained determined to stay in power. He revived the regular use of revolutionary rhetoric and sought to reassert his credentials as an important revolutionary leader.\n\nMugabe also developed a growing preoccupation with homosexuality, lambasting it as an \"un-African\" import from Europe. He described gay people as being \"guilty of sub-human behaviour\", and of being \"worse than dogs and pigs\". This attitude may have stemmed in part from his strong conservative values but also from an awareness that militant homophobia would distract attention from the country's problems. In August 1995, he was due to open a human rights-themed Zimbabwe International Book Fair in Harare but refused to do so until a stall run by the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe group was evicted.\nIn 1996, Mugabe was appointed chair of the defence arm of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Without consulting parliament, in August 1998 he ordered Zimbabwean troops into the Congo to side with President Laurent Kabila in the Second Congo War. He initially committed 3000 troops to the operation, although this gradually rose to 11,000. He also persuaded Angola and Namibia to commit troops to the conflict. Involvement in the war cost Zimbabwe an approximate US$1 million a day, contributing to its economic problems. Opinion polls demonstrated that it was unpopular among Zimbabwe's population. However, several Zimbabwean businesses profited, having been given mining and timber concessions and preferential trade terms in minerals from Kabila's government.\n\nIn January 1999, 23 military officers were arrested for plotting a coup against Mugabe. The government sought to hide this, although it was reported on by journalists from \"The Standard\". The military subsequently illegally arrested the journalists and tortured them. This brought international condemnation, with the EU and seven donor nations issuing protest notes. Lawyers and human rights activists protested outside parliament until being dispersed by riot police, and the country's Supreme Court judges issued a letter condemning the military's actions. In response, Mugabe publicly defended the use of extra-legal arrest and torture.\n\nIn 1997, Tony Blair was elected Prime Minister of the UK; his New Labour government expressed reticence toward restarting the land resettlement payments promised by the Lancaster House Agreement, with minister Clare Short rejecting the idea that the UK had any moral obligation to fund land redistribution. This attitude fuelled anti-imperialist sentiment across Africa. In October 1999, Mugabe visited Britain; in London, the human rights activist Peter Tatchell attempted to place him under citizen's arrest. Mugabe believed that the British government had deliberately engineered the incident to embarrass him. It further damaged Anglo-Zimbabwean relations, with Mugabe expressing scorn for what he called \"Blair and company\". In May 2000, the UK froze all development aid to Zimbabwe. In December 1999, the IMF terminated financial support for Zimbabwe, citing economic mismanagement and widespread corruption as impediments to reform.\n\nTo meet growing demand for constitutional reform, in April 1999 Mugabe's government appointed a 400-member Constitutional Commission to draft a new constitution which could be put to a referendum. The National Constitutional Assembly—a pro-reform pressure group established in 1997—expressed concern that this commission was not independent of the government, noting that Mugabe had the power to amend or reject the draft. The NCA called for the draft constitution to be rejected, and in a February 2000 referendum it was, with 53% against to 44% in favour; turnout was under 25%. It was ZANU-PF's first major electoral defeat in twenty years. Mugabe was furious, and blamed the white minority for orchestrating his defeat, referring to them as \"enemies of Zimbabwe\".\n\nThe June 2000 parliamentary elections were Zimbabwe's most important since 1980. Sixteen parties took part, although the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)—led by trade unionist Morgan Tsvangirai—was particularly successful. During the election campaign, MDC activists were regularly harassed and in some cases killed. The Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum documented 27 murders, 27 rapes, 2466 assaults, and 617 abductions, with 10,000 people displaced by violence; the majority, although not all, of these actions were carried out by ZANU-PF supporters. Observers from the European Union (EU) ruled that the election was neither free nor fair. The vote produced 48% and 62 parliamentary seats for ZANU-PF and 47% and 57 parliamentary seats for the MDC. For the first time, ZANU-PF were denied the two-thirds parliamentary majority required to push through constitutional change. ZANU-PF had relied heavily on their support base in rural Shona-speaking areas, and retained only one urban constituency.\n\nIn February 2000, the land invasions began as armed gangs attacked and occupied white-owned farms. The government referred to the attackers as \"war veterans\" although the majority were unemployed youth too young to have fought in the Rhodesian War. Mugabe claimed that the attacks were a spontaneous uprising against white land owners, although the government had paid Z$20 million to Chenjerai Hunzvi's War Veterans Association to lead the land invasion campaign and ZANU-PF officials, police, and military figures were all involved in facilitating it. Some of Mugabe's colleagues described the invasions as retribution for the white community's alleged involvement in securing the success of the 'no' vote in the recent referendum. Mugabe justified the seizures by the fact that this land had been seized by white settlers from the indigenous African population in the 1890s. He portrayed the invasions as a struggle against colonialism and alleged that the UK was trying to overthrow his government. In May 2000, he issued a decree under the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act which empowered the government to seize farms without providing compensation, insisting that it was the British government that should make these payments.\n\nIn March 2000, Zimbabwe's High Court ruled that the land invasions were illegal; they nevertheless continued, and Mugabe began vilifying Zimbabwe's judiciary. After the Supreme Court also backed this decision, the government called on its judges to resign, successfully pressuring chief justice Anthony Gubbay to do so. ZANU-PF member Godfrey Chidyausiku was appointed to replace him, while the number of Supreme Court judges was expanded from five to eight; the three additional seats went to pro-Mugabe figures. The first act of the new Supreme Court was to reverse the previous declaration that the land seizures were illegal. In November 2001, Mugabe issued a presidential decree permitting the expropriation of virtually all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe without compensation.\nThe farm seizures were often violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, with many of their employees experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their lack of access to fertiliser.\n\nThe farm invasions severely impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe had produced over two million tons of maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000. By October 2003, Human Rights Watch reported that half of the country's population were food insecure, lacking enough food to meet basic needs. By 2009, 75% of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. In 2000, the country's GDP was US$7.4 billion; by 2005 this had declined to US$3.4 billion. Inflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000% and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.\n\nOther sectors of society were negatively affected too. By 2005, an estimated 80% of Zimbabwe's population were unemployed, and by 2008 only 20% of children were in schooling. The breakdown of water supplies and sewage systems resulted in a cholera outbreak in late 2008, with over 98,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe between August 2008 and mid-July 2009. The ruined economy also impacted the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country; by 2008 the HIV/AIDS rate for individuals aged between 15 and 49 was 15.3%. In 2007, the World Health Organization declared the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe to be 34 for women and 36 for men, down from 63 and 54 respectively in 1997. The country's lucrative tourist industry was decimated, and there was a rise in poaching, including of endangered species. Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem; he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.\n\nIn October 2000, the MDC's MPs attempted to impeach Mugabe, although were thwarted by the Speaker of the House, Mugabe-loyalist Emmerson Mnangagwa.\nZANU-PF increasingly equated itself with Zimbabwean patriotism, with MDC supporters being portrayed as traitors and enemies of Zimbabwe. The party presented itself as being on the progressive side of history, with the MDC representing a counter-revolutionary force that seeks to undermine the achievements of the ZANU-PF revolution and of decolonisation itself. Mugabe claimed that the build-up to the 2002 presidential election represented \"the third Chimurenga\" and that it would set Zimbabwe free from its colonial heritage. In the build-up to the election, the government changed the electoral rules and regulations to improve Mugabe's chances of victory. New security legislation was introduced making it illegal to criticise the President. The defence force commander, General Zvinavashe, stated that the military would not recognise any election result other than a Mugabe victory. The EU withdrew its observers from the country, stating that the vote was neither free nor fair.\nThe election resulted in Mugabe securing 56% of the vote to Tsvangerai's 42%. In the aftermath of the election Mugabe declared that the state-owned Grain Marketing Board had the sole right to import and distribute grain, with the state distributors giving food to ZANU-PF supporters while withholding it from those suspected of backing the MDC. In 2005, Mugabe instituted Operation Murambatsvina (\"Operation Drive Out the Rubbish\"), a project of forced slum clearance; a UN report estimated that 700,000 were left homeless.\nSince the inhabitants of the shantytowns overwhelmingly voted MDC, many alleged that the bulldozing was politically motivated.\nMugabe's actions brought strong criticism. The Zimbabwe Council of Churches accused him of plunging the country into \"a de facto state of warfare\" to stay in power. Several Southern African states remonstrated with him at a summit in Harare in September 2001. In 2002, the British Commonwealth expelled Zimbabwe from among its ranks; Mugabe blamed this on anti-black racism, a view echoed by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki. Mbeki favoured a policy of \"quiet diplomacy\" in dealing with Mugabe, and prevented the African Union (AU) from introducing sanctions against him. The Africa-Europe Summit, scheduled to take place in Lisbon in April 2003, was deferred repeatedly because African leaders refused to attend while Mugabe was banned; it eventually took place in 2007 with Mugabe in attendance. In 2004, the EU imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on Mugabe. It extended these sanctions in 2008, with the US government introducing further sanctions this same year. The US and UK introduced a resolution at the UN Security Council calling for an arms embargo of Zimbabwe alongside an asset freeze and travel ban of Mugabe and other government figures; it was vetoed by Russia and China. In 2009, the SADC demanded that Western states lift their targeted sanctions against Mugabe and his government. ZANU-PF presented the sanctions as a form of Western neo-colonialism and blamed the West for Zimbabwe's economic problems.\n\nBritish prime minister Tony Blair had an antagonistic relationship with Mugabe and allegedly planned regime change in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s as pressure intensified for Mugabe to step down. British General Charles Guthrie, the Chief of the Defence Staff, revealed in 2007 that he and Blair had discussed the invasion of Zimbabwe. However, Guthrie advised against military action: \"Hold hard, you'll make it worse.\" In 2013, South African President Thabo Mbeki said that Blair had also pressured South Africa to join in a \"regime change scheme, even to the point of using military force\" in Zimbabwe. Mbeki refused because he felt that \"Mugabe is part of the solution to this problem.\" However, a spokesman for Blair said that \"he never asked anyone to plan or take part in any such military intervention.\"\n\nIn March 2008, the parliamentary and presidential elections were held. In the former, ZANU-PF secured 97 seats to the MDC's 99 and the rival MDC – Ncube's 9. In May, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission announced the presidential vote results, confirming that Tsvangirai secured 47.9%, to Mugabe's 43.2%. As neither candidate secured 50%, a run-off vote was scheduled.\nMugabe saw his defeat as an unacceptable personal humiliation. He deemed it a victory for his Western, and in particular British, detractors, whom he believed were working with Tsvangirai to end his political career. ZANU-PF claimed that the MDC had rigged the election.\n\nAfter the election, Mugabe's government deployed its 'war veterans' in a violent campaign against Tsvangirai supporters. Between March and June 2008, at least 153 MDC supporters were killed. \nThere were reports of women affiliated with the MDC being subjected to gang rape by Mugabe supporters. Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans were internally displaced by the violence. These actions brought international condemnation of Mugabe's government. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon expressed concern about the violence, which was also unanimously condemned by the UN Security Council, which declared that a free and fair election was \"impossible\". 40 senior African leaders—among them Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan, and Jerry Rawlings—signed an open letter calling for an end to the violence.\n\nIn response to the violence, Tsangirai pulled out of the run-off. In the second round, Mugabe was pronounced victor with 85.5% of the vote, and immediately re-inaugurated as President. The SADC oversaw the establishment of a power-sharing agreement; brokered by Mbeke, it was signed in September 2008. \nUnder the agreement, Mugabe remained President while Tsvangerai became Prime Minister and the MDC's Arthur Mutambara became Vice Prime Minister. The cabinet was equally divided among MDC and ZANU-PF members. ZANU-PF nevertheless displayed unwillingness to share power, and were anxious to prevent any sweeping political changes. \nUnder the power-sharing agreement, a number of limited reforms were passed. In early 2009, Mugabe's government declared that—to combat rampant inflation—it would recognise U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency. This helped to stabilise prices. ZANU-PF blogged many of the proposed reforms although a new constitution was passed in March 2013.\n\nDeclaring that he would \"fight like a wounded animal\" for re-election, Mugabe approached the 2013 elections believing that it would be his last. He hoped that a decisive electoral victory would secure his legacy, signal his triumph over his Western critics, and irreparably damage Tsvangirai's credibility. The opposition parties believed that this election was their best chance for ousting Mugabe. They portrayed him as a feeble old man who was being told what to do by the military, although at least one academic observer argued that this was untrue.\n\nIn contrast to 2008, there was no organised dissent against Mugabe within ZANU-PF. The party elite decided to avoid the violence that had marred 2008's election so as not to undermine its credibility, particularly in the eyes of the SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference. Mugabe called upon supporters to avoid violence, and attended far fewer rallies than in past elections, in part because of his advanced age and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger. The ZANU-PF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members of the electorate to encourage them to vote for the party.\n\nZANU-PF won a landslide victory, with 61% of the presidential vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views out of fear of reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it had been just as corrupt as ZANU-PF. ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights.\nIn February 2014, Mugabe underwent a cataract operation in Singapore; on return he celebrated his ninetieth birthday at a Marondera football stadium. In December 2014, Mugabe fired his Vice-President, Joice Mujuru, accusing her of plotting his overthrow. In January 2015, Mugabe was elected as the Chairperson of the African Union (AU). In November 2015, he announced his intention to run for re-election as Zimbabwe's President in 2018, at the age of 94, and was accepted as the ZANU-PF candidate. In February 2016, Mugabe said he had no plans for retirement and would remain in power \"until God says 'come'\". In February 2017, right after his 93rd birthday, Mugabe stated he would not retire nor pick a successor, even though he said he would let his party choose a successor if it saw fit. In May 2017, Mugabe took a weeklong trip to Cancún, Mexico, ostensibly to attend a three-day conference on disaster risk reduction, eliciting criticism of wasteful spending from opposition figures. He made three medical trips to Singapore in 2017, and Grace Mugabe called on him to name a successor.\n\nIn October 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) appointed Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador; this attracted criticism from both the Zimbabwean opposition and various foreign governments given the poor state of the Zimbabwean health system. Responding to the outcry, WHO revoked Mugabe's appointment a day later.  In response, foreign minister Walter Mzembi said the United Nations system should be reformed.\n\nOn 6 November 2017, Mugabe sacked his first vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. This fueled speculation that he intended to name Grace his successor. Grace was very unpopular with the ZANU-PF old guard. On 15 November 2017, the Zimbabwe National Army placed Mugabe under house arrest as part of what it described as an action against \"criminals\" in Mugabe's circle.\n\nOn 19 November, he was sacked as leader of ZANU-PF, and Mnangagwa was appointed in his place. The party also gave Mugabe an ultimatum–resign by noon the following day, or it would introduce an impeachment resolution against him. In a nationally televised speech that night, Mugabe refused to say that he would resign. In response, ZANU-PF deputies introduced an impeachment resolution on 21 November 2017, which was seconded by the MDC-T. The constitution stipulated that removing a president from office required a two-thirds majority of both the House of Assembly and Senate in a joint sitting. However, with both major parties supporting the motion, Mugabe's impeachment and removal appeared all but certain.\n\nAs per the constitution, both chambers met in joint session to debate the resolution. The debate took place at a conference centre, since Parliament House was not large enough for a joint sitting. Hours after the debate began, the Speaker of the House of Assembly read a letter from Mugabe announcing that he had resigned, effective immediately. Mugabe and his wife negotiated a deal before his resignation, under which he and his kin are exempted from prosecution, his business interests will remain untouched, and he is set to receive a payment of at least $10 million. In July 2018, the Zimbabwe Supreme Court ruled that Mugabe had resigned voluntarily, despite some of the ex-president's subsequent comments.\n\nMugabe was given full diplomatic status in late December 2017 and was entitled to a house, up to 23 staff members, and personal vehicles, according to a government gazette. In his first interview since being removed from presidency, Mugabe stated on 15 March 2018 that he was ousted in a \"coup d'état\" which must be undone. He stated that he would not work with Mnangagwa and termed his presidency as \"illegal\" and \"unconstitutional\". In a lawsuit brought by two political parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Revolutionary Freedom Fighters, and others, the court found that the resignation was legal, and that Mnangagwa, as vice president, duly took over the presidency. As Zimbabweans prepared to participate in the country's first election without Mugabe in almost 30 years, on the eve of the election on 29 July 2018, Mugabe made a surprise press conference where he stated his wish not to vote for President Mnangagwa and ZANU-PF, the party he founded. Instead, he expressed his wish to vote his long time rival party, the MDC of Nelson Chamisa.\n\nMugabe embraced African nationalism and anti-colonialism during the 1960s. Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni characterised \"Mugabeism\" as a populist movement that was \"marked by ideological simplicity, emptiness, vagueness, imprecision, and multi-class character\", further noting that it was \"a broad church\". He also characterised it as a form of \"left-nationalism\", which consistently railed against imperialism and colonialism. He also argued that it was a form of nativism, which was permeated by a strong \"cult of victimisation\" in which a binary view was propagated where Africa was a \"victim\" and the West was its \"tormentor\". He suggested that it had been influenced by a wide range of ideologies, among them forms of Marxism like Stalinism and Maoism, as well as African nationalist ideologies like Nkrumaism, \"Ujamaa\", Garveyism, \"Négritude\", Pan-Africanism, and African neo-traditionalism.\nMugabism sought to deal with the problem of white settler racism by engaging in a project of reverse racism that sought to deny white Zimbabweans citizenship by constantly referring to them as \"\"amabhunu\"/Boers\", thus enabling their removal from their land.\n\nZANU-PF claimed that it was influenced by Marxism–Leninism although Onslow and Redding stated that in contrast to the Marxist emphasis on the urban proletariat as the main force of socio-economic change, Mugabe's party accorded that role to the rural peasantry. As a result of this pro-rural view, they argued, Mugabe and the ZANU-PF demonstrated an anti-urban bias. The English academic Claire Palley met Mugabe in 1962, later noting that \"he struck me as not so much a doctrinaire Marxist but an old-fashioned African nationalist\", while Tekere claimed that for Mugabe, Marxism-Leninism was \"just rhetoric\" with \"no genuine vision or belief behind it\". Carington noted that while Mugabe used Marxist rhetoric during the Lancaster House negotiations, \"of course he didn't actually practice what he preached, did he? Once in office he became a capitalist\". \nMugabe has stated that \"socialism has to be much more Christian than capitalism\". The Zimbabwean scholar George Shire described Mugabe's policies as being \"broadly-speaking\" social-democratic.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Mugabe indicated his desire to transform Zimbabwe from a multi-party state into a one-party state. In 1984 he stated that \"the one-party state is more in keeping with African tradition. It makes for greater unity for the people. It puts all opinions under one umbrella, whether these opinions are radical or reactionary\". The political scientist Sue Onslow and historian Sean Redding stated that Zimbabwe's situation was \"more complex than pure venial dictatorship\", but that it was an \"ideo-dictatorship\".\n\nNdlovu-Gatsheni argued that since the mid-1990s, Mugabe's rhetoric and speeches came to be dominated by three main themes: an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of belonging and patriotism. References to the Rhodesian Bush War featured prominently in Mugabe's speeches. The scholar of African studies Abiodun Alao noted that Mugabe was determined to \"take advantage of the past in order to secure a firm grip on national security\".\n\nDavid Blair stated that \"Mugabe's collected writings amount to nothing more than crude Marxism, couched in the ponderous English of the mission school\", remarking that they were heavily informed by Karl Marx, Mao Zedong, and Frantz Fanon, and displayed little originality. Blair noted that Mugabe's writings called for \"command economics in a peasant society, mixed with anti-colonial nationalism\", and that in this he held \"the same opinions as almost every other African guerrilla leader\" of that period. Mugabe argued that following the overthrow of European colonial regimes, Western countries continued to keep African countries in a state of subservience because they desired the continent's natural resources while preventing it from industrialising.\n\nMugabe is of average height, measuring a little over , and exhibits what his biographer David Blair described as \"curious, effeminate mannerisms\". Mugabe took great care with his appearance, typically wearing a three-piece suit, and insisting that members of his cabinet dressed in a similar Anglophile fashion. On taking power in 1980, Mugabe's hallmark was his wide-rimmed glasses, and he was also known for his tiny moustache. Unlike a number of other African leaders, Mugabe did not seek to mythologise his childhood. He avoided smoking and drinking, and—according to his first biographers, David Smith and Colin Simpson—had \"enormous affection for children\". During his early life he had an operation on his genitals which generated rumours that he had only one testicle or half a penis; such rumours were used by opponents to ridicule him and by supporters to bolster the claim that he was willing to make severe sacrifices for the revolutionary cause.\n\nMugabe spoke English fluently with an adopted English accent when pronouncing certain words. He was also a fan of the English game of cricket, stating that \"cricket civilizes people and creates good gentlemen\". David Blair noted that this cultivation of British traits suggested that Mugabe respected and perhaps admired Britain while at the same time resenting and loathing the country. Holland suggested that these Anglophile traits arose in early life, as Mugabe—who had long experienced the anti-black racism of Rhodesian society—\"grasped Englishness as an antidote\" to the \"self-loathing\" induced by societal racism.\n\nThe academic Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that Mugabe was \"an extremely complex figure, not easily captured by conventional categories\". Similarly, David Blair described him as an \"exceptionally complex personality\". Smith and Simpson noted that the Zimbabwean leader had been \"a serious young man, something of a loner, diligent, hard-working, a voracious reader who used every minute of his time, not much given to laughter: but above all, single-minded\". Blair commented that Mugabe's \"self-discipline, intelligence and appetite for hard work were remarkable\", adding that his \"prime characteristics\" were \"ruthlessness and resilience\". Blair argued that Mugabe shared many character traits with Ian Smith, stating that they were both \"proud, brave, stubborn, charismatic, deluded fantasists\".\n\nMeredith described Mugabe as having a \"soft-spoken demeanour, ... broad intellect, and ... articulate manner\", all of which disguised his \"hardened and single-minded ambition\". Ndlovu-Gatsheni characterised him as \"one of the most charismatic African leaders\", highlighting that he was \"very eloquent\" and was able to make \"fine speeches\". Jonathan Moyo, who briefly served as Mugabe's information minister before falling out with him, stated that the President could \"express himself well, that is his great strength\".\nTendi stated that although he had a natural wittiness, Mugabe often hid this behind \"an outwardly pensive and austere manner and his penchant for ceremony and tradition\". Heidi Holland suggested that due to his \"dysfunctional\" upbringing, Mugabe had a \"fragile self-image\", describing him as \"a man cut off from his feelings, devoid of ordinary warmth and humanity\". According to her, Mugabe had a \"marked emotional immaturity\", and was homophobic, as well as racist and xenophobic.\n\nAccording to Meredith, Mugabe presented himself as \"articulate, thoughtful, and conciliatory\" after his 1980 election victory. Blair noted that at this period of his career, Mugabe displayed \"genuine magnanimity and moral courage\" despite his \"intense personal reasons for feeling bitterness and hatred\" toward the members of the former regime. Following his dealing with Mugabe during the 1979 negotiations, Michael Pallister, head of the British Foreign Office, described Mugabe as having \"a very sharp, sometimes rather aggressive, and unpleasant manner\". The British diplomat Peter Longworth stated that in private, Mugabe was \"very charming and very articulate and he's not devoid of humour. It's very difficult to relate the man you meet with the man ranting on television\". Norman stated that \"I always found him personable and honourable in his dealings. He also had a warm side to him which I saw quite clearly sometimes\".\n\nColin Legum, a journalist with \"The Observer\", argued that Mugabe had a \"paranoidal personality\", in that while he did not suffer from clinical paranoia, he did behave in a paranoid fashion when placed under severe and sustained pressure. Mugabe biographer Andrew Norman suggested that the leader may have suffered from antisocial personality disorder.\nSeveral Mugabe biographers have observed that he had an obsession with accruing power. According to Meredith, \"power for Mugabe was not a means to an end, but the end itself.\" Conversely, Onslow and Redding suggested that Mugabe's craving for power stemmed from \"ideological and personal reasons\" and his belief in the illegitimacy of his political opposition. Denis Norman, a white politician who served in Mugabe's cabinet for many years, commented that \"Mugabe isn't a flashy man driven by wealth but he does enjoy power. That's always been his motivation\".\n\nAccording to Holland, Mugabe's first wife, Sally Hayfron, was Mugabe's \"confidante and only real friend\", being \"one of the few people who could challenge Mugabe's ideas without offending him\".\n\nTheir only son, Michael Nhamodzenyika Mugabe, born 27 September 1963, died on 26 December 1966 from cerebral malaria in Ghana where Sally was working while Mugabe was in prison. Sally Mugabe was a trained teacher who asserted her position as an independent political activist and campaigner.\n\nMugabe called on Zimbabwe's media to refer to his wife as \"Amai\" (\"Mother of the Nation\"), although many Zimbabweans resented the fact that she was a foreigner. She was appointed as the head of ZANU-PF's women's league, and was involved in a number of charitable operations, although was widely regarded as corrupt in these dealings. During Mugabe's premiership she suffered from renal failure, and initially had to travel to Britain for dialysis until Soames arranged for a dialysis machine to be sent to Zimbabwe.\n\nWhile married to Hayfron, in 1987 Mugabe began an extra-marital affair with his secretary, Grace Marufu; she was 41 years his junior and at the time was married to Stanley Goreraza. In 1988 she bore Mugabe a daughter, Bona, and in 1990 a son, Robert. The relationship was kept secret from the Zimbabwean public, although Hayfron was aware of it.\nAccording to her niece Patricia Bekele, with whom she was particularly close, Hayfron was not happy that Mugabe had an affair with Marufu but \"she did what she used to tell me to do: 'Talk to your pillow if you have problems in your marriage. Never, ever, humiliate your husband.' Her motto was to carry on in gracious style\". Hayfron died in 1992 from a chronic kidney ailment.\n\nFollowing Hayfron's death in 1992, Mugabe and Marufu were married in a large Catholic wedding ceremony in August 1996.\nAs First Lady of Zimbabwe, Grace gained a reputation for indulging her love of luxury, with a particular interest in shopping, clothes, and jewelry. These lavish shopping sprees have led to her receiving the nickname \"Gucci Grace\". She too developed a reputation for corruption. In 1997, Grace Mugabe gave birth to the couple's third child, Chatunga Bellarmine.\n\nRobert Mugabe Junior and his younger brother Chatunga Bellarmine are known for posting their lavish lifestyle on social media, which has drawn accusations from Tendai Biti that they are wasting Zimbabwean taxpayers' money.\n\nBy the twenty-first century, Mugabe was regarded as one of the world's most controversial political leaders. According to \"The Black Scholar\" journal, \"depending on who you listen to ... Mugabe is either one of the world's great tyrants or a fearless nationalist who has incurred the wrath of the West.\" He has been widely described as a \"dictator\", a \"tyrant\", and a \"threat\", and has been referred to as one of Africa's \"most brutal\" leaders. At the same time he continued to be regarded as a hero in many Third World countries and received a warm reception when travelling throughout Africa. For many in Southern Africa, he remained one of the \"grand old men\" of the African liberation movement.\n\nAccording to Ndlovu-Gatsheni, within ZANU-PF, Mugabe was regarded as a \"demi-god\" who was feared and rarely challenged. Within the ZANU movement, a cult of personality began to be developed around Mugabe during the Bush War and was consolidated after 1980. Mugabe had a considerable following within Zimbabwe, with David Blair noting that \"it would be wrong to imply that he lacked genuine popularity\" in the country. Holland believed that the \"great majority\" of Zimbabwe's population supported him \"enthusiastically\" during the first twenty years of his regime. His strongholds of support were Zimbabwe's Shona-dominated regions of Mashonaland, Manicaland, and Masvingo, while he remained far less popular in the non-Shona areas of Matabeleland and Bulawayo, and among the Zimbabwean diaspora living abroad.\n\nAt the time of his 1980 election victory, Mugabe was internationally acclaimed as a revolutionary hero who was embracing racial reconciliation, and for the first decade of his governance he was widely regarded as \"one of post-colonial Africa's most progressive leaders\". David Blair argued that while Mugabe did exhibit a \"conciliatory phase\" between March 1980 and February 1982, his rule was otherwise \"dominated by a ruthless quest to crush his opponents and remain in office at whatever cost\". In 2011, the scholar Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that \"Mugabe is often presented in the international media as the epitome of the popular leader gone awry: the independence struggle hero who seemed initially a progressive egalitarian, but has gradually been corrupted through his attachment to power during a long and increasingly repressive spell in office.\" Tendi argued that this was a misleading assessment, because Mugabe had displayed repressive tendencies from his early years in office, namely through the repression of ZAPU in Matabeleland. Abiodun Alao concurred, suggesting that Mugabe's approach had not changed over the course of his leadership, but merely that international attention had intensified in the twenty-first century.\nFor many Africans, Mugabe exposed the double standards of Western countries; the latter had turned a blind eye to the massacre of over 20,000 black Ndebele civilians in the Gukarakundi but strongly censured the Zimbabwean government when a small number of white farmers were killed during the land seizures.\nDuring the guerrilla war, Ian Smith referred to Mugabe as \"the apostle of Satan\". George Shire expressed the view that there was \"a strong racist animus\" against Mugabe within Zimbabwe, and that this had typically been overlooked by Western media representations of the country. Mugabe has himself been accused of racism; John Sentamu, the Uganda-born Archbishop of York in the United Kingdom, called Mugabe \"the worst kind of racist dictator\", for having \"targeted the whites for their apparent riches\". They have been denounced as racist against Zimbabwe's white minority. Desmond Tutu stated that Mugabe became \"increasingly insecure, he's hitting out. One just wants to weep. It's very sad.\" South African President Nelson Mandela was also critical of Mugabe, referring to him as a politician who \"despise[s] the very people who put [him] in power and think[s] it's a privilege to be there for eternity\".\n\nWriting for the \"Human Rights Quarterly\", Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann claimed that there was \"clear evidence that Mugabe was guilty of crimes against humanity\". In 2009, Gregory Stanton, then President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and Helen Fein, then Executive Director of the Institute for the Study of Genocide, published a letter in \"The New York Times\" stating that there was sufficient evidence of crimes against humanity to bring Mugabe to trial in front of the International Criminal Court. Australia and New Zealand had previously called for this in 2005, and a number of Zimbabwean NGOs did so in 2006.\n\nA 2005 article from the New American titled \"Democide in Zimbabwe\" says that Mugabe reduced the population of Zimbabwe a few millions in just a few years.\n\nIn 1994, Mugabe received an honorary knighthood from the British state; this was stripped from him at the advice of the UK government in 2008. Mugabe holds several honorary degrees and doctorates from international universities, awarded to him in the 1980s; at least three of these have since been revoked. In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever to be stripped of an honorary degree by a British university, when the University of Edinburgh withdrew the degree awarded to him in 1984. On 12 June 2008, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Board of Trustees voted to revoke the law degree awarded to Mugabe in 1986; this is the first time one of its honorary degrees has been revoked.\n\n"}
{"id": "260910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=260910", "title": "Roger Sherman", "text": "Roger Sherman\n\nRoger Sherman (April 19, 1721 – July 23, 1793) was an early American statesman and lawyer, as well as a Founding Father of the United States. He is the only person to have signed all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution.\n\nBorn in Newton, Massachusetts, Sherman established a legal career in Litchfield County, Connecticut despite a lack of formal education. After a period in the Connecticut House of Representatives, he served as a Justice of the Superior Court of Connecticut from 1766 to 1789. He represented Connecticut at the Continental Congress and signed the Continental Association, which provided for a boycott against Britain following the imposition of the Intolerable Acts. He was also a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence. He later signed both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution. In 1784, he was elected as the first mayor of New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nSherman served as a delegate to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, which produced the United States Constitution. After Benjamin Franklin, he was the oldest delegate present at the convention. Along with James Wilson, he proposed the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted three-fifths of the slave population for the purposes of representation in the United States House of Representatives and the Electoral College. He favored granting the federal government power to raise revenue and regulate commerce, but initially opposed efforts to supplant the Articles of Confederation with a new constitution. He ultimately came to support the establishment of a new constitution, and proposed the Connecticut Compromise, which won the approval of both the larger states and the smaller states.\n\nAfter the ratification of the Constitution, Sherman represented Connecticut in the United States House of Representatives from 1789 to 1791. He served in the United States Senate from 1791 to his death in 1793.\n\nSherman was born into a farm family located in Newton, Massachusetts, near Boston. His father was William and mother Mehetabel Sherman. Mehetabel's father was Benjamin Wellington and her mother was Elizabeth Sweetman, whose christening date was March 4, 1687 (or 1688), and she died on April 12, 1776. William and Mehetabel had seven children, William Jr., Mehetabel, Roger (1721), Elizabeth (married James Buck), Nathaniel (became a Reverend), Josiah (also became a Reverend), and Rebecca (married Joseph Hartwell Jr.). After Elizabeth was born (1723), the Shermans left Newton and settled in the south precinct of Dorchester, that three years later became the township of Stoughton and located south of Boston, when Roger was two. William married Rebecca Cutler on July 15, 1714. Josiah was Chaplain of the 7th Connecticut from January 1 to December 6, 1777.\n\nThe part of Stoughton where Sherman grew up became part of Canton in 1797. Sherman's education did not extend beyond his father's library and grammar school, and his early career was spent as a shoe-maker. However, he had an aptitude for learning, and access to a good library owned by his father, as well as a Harvard-educated parish minister, the Rev. Samuel Dunbar, who took him under his wing.\n\nIn 1743, due to his father's death, Sherman moved (on foot) with his mother and siblings to New Milford, Connecticut, where in partnership with his brother William (wife Ruth), he opened the town's first store. He very quickly introduced himself in civil and religious affairs, rapidly becoming one of the town's leading citizens and eventually town clerk of New Milford. Due to his mathematical skill he became county surveyor of New Haven County in 1745, and began providing astronomical calculations for almanacs in 1759.\n\nRoger Sherman was married two times and had a total of fifteen children with thirteen reaching adulthood.\n\nSherman married Elizabeth on November 17, 1749. She was born August 31, 1726, in Stoughton, her father was Deacon Joseph Hartwell (born August 11, 1698, died February 6, 1786) and her mother was Mary Hartwell (née Tolman), who was born on October 4, 1697, and died on November 10, 1782. They were married by Samuel Dunbar and had seven children. Elizabeth died on October 19, 1760.\n\nSherman married Rebecca (also spelled Rebekah) Prescott on May 12, 1763. She was born on May 20, 1742, in Danvers, Essex County, Massachusetts. They had eight children, Rebecca; married and then Elizabeth; married same Simeon Baldwin, Roger, Mehetabel (1st), Mehetabel (2nd); married Jeremiah Evarts, Oliver, Martha; married Jeremiah Day, and Sarah; married Samuel Hoar. The first Mehitabel and Oliver both died in infancy. Rebecca died in August 1814.\n\nA son, Roger Sherman Jr. (1768–1856), a 1787 graduate of Yale College served in the Connecticut General Assembly in 1810–1811.\n\nA daughter, Rebeca Sherman, was married to Simeon Baldwin, whose career included service in the United States Congress (1803–1806), as an Associate Judge of the Connecticut Superior Court, 1806–1817, and who became Mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, in 1826. Following the death of Rebecca Sherman, Baldwin married another of Roger Sherman's daughters, Elizabeth Sherman Burr. His daughter, Mehetabel Sherman Barnes married Jeremiah Evarts, who served as treasurer and secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. His daughter Martha Sherman married Jeremiah Day, who was President of Yale University from 1817 to 1846. Another daughter, Sarah Sherman, married Samuel Hoar, who was a member of the Massachusetts state legislature and the U.S. Congress.\n\nGrandfathers before Henry Sherman (the older) were Thomas (10th generation), John (9th generation), and Thomas Sherman (8th generation).\n\nSherman is especially notable in United States history for being the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Association, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution. Robert Morris, who did not sign the Articles of Association, signed the other three. John Dickinson also signed three, the Continental Association, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution. He was involved with the Declaration of Independence but abstained, hoping for a reconciliation with Britain.\n\nDespite the fact that Sherman had no formal legal training, he was urged to read for the bar exam by a local lawyer and was admitted to the Bar of Litchfield, Connecticut in 1754, during which he wrote A Caveat Against Injustice and was chosen to represent New Milford in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1755 to 1758 and from 1760 to 1761.\n\nSherman was appointed justice of the peace in 1762 and judge of the court of common pleas in 1765. During 1766, Sherman was first elected to the Governor's Council of the Connecticut General Assembly, where he served until 1785.\n\nSherman served as Justice of the Superior Court of Connecticut from 1766 to 1789, when he left to become a member of the United States Congress.\nSherman was also appointed treasurer of Yale College, and awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree. He was a professor of religion for many years, and engaged in lengthy correspondences with some of the theologians of the time.\n\nDuring February 1776, Sherman, George Wythe, and John Adams were members of a committee responsible for establishing guidelines for U.S. embassy officials in Canada with the committee instructions that included, \"You are to declare that we hold sacred the rights of conscience, and may promise to the whole people, solemnly in our name, the free and undisturbed exercise of their religion. And...that all civil rights and the rights to hold office were to be extended to persons of any Christian denomination.\"\n\nIn 1784 he was elected Mayor of New Haven, which office he held until his death.\n\nIn 1790 both Sherman and Richard Law were appointed to revise the confused and archaic Connecticut statutes, which they accomplished.\n\nThroughout his life, Sherman was a major benefactor of Yale College, acting as the university's treasurer for many years and promoting construction of a college chapel. Roger Sherman died in 1793.\n\nRoger Sherman was one of the most influential members of the Constitutional Convention. He is not well known for his actions at the Convention because he was a \"terse, ineloquent speaker\" who never kept a personal record of his experience, unlike other prominent figures at the convention such as James Madison, and at 66 years of age, Sherman was the second eldest member at the convention following Benjamin Franklin (who was 81 years old at the time). Yet as one of the most active members of the Convention, Sherman made motions or seconds in reference to the Virginia Plan 160 times. His opponent Madison made motions or seconds 177 times.\n\nRoger Sherman came into the Convention without the intention of creating a new constitution. Sherman, an original signer of the Articles of Confederation, saw the convention as a means to modify the already existing government. Part of his stance was concerned with the public appeal. He defended amending the articles declaring that it was in the best interest of the people and the most probable way the people would accept changes to a constitution. Sherman saw no reason for a bicameral legislature, as proposed by the Virginia Plan. \"The problem with the old government was not that it had acted foolishly or threatened anybody's liberties, but that it had simply been unable to enforce its decrees\". Sherman further advanced the idea that the national government simply needed a way to raise revenue and regulate commerce. Sherman was a big defender of a unicameral legislature. He defended the unicameral legislature of the Articles of Confederation by stating that the large states had not \"suffered at the hands of small states on account of the rule of equal voting\". Ultimately, when Sherman saw his initial goals of the convention as unattainable he organized compromises and deals in order to enact some of his desirable legislation.\n\nSherman was from a particularly isolationist state – Connecticut operated almost without much need from other states, using its own ports to trade with the West Indies instead of utilizing ports in Boston – and feared that \"...the mass of people lacked sufficient wisdom to govern themselves and thus wished no branch of the federal government to be elected directly by the people\".\nSherman, Elbridge Gerry (himself later recognized as the namesake of American political gerrymandering) and others were of the shared opinion that the elected composition of the national government should be reserved for the vote of state officials and not for election by the will of the people. Sherman was wary of allowing ordinary citizen participation in national government and stated that the people \"should have as little to do as may be about the Government. They want information and are constantly liable to be misled\".\n\nThe two proposed options for the formation of the legislative branch emerged in the deliberations. One was to form a bicameral legislature in which both chambers had representation proportional to the population of the states, which was supported by the Virginia plan. The second was to modify the unicameral legislature that had equal representation from all of the states, which was supported by the New Jersey plan. Roger Sherman was a devout supporter of a unicameral legislature, but when he saw that goal as unattainable he motioned to compromise. In terms of modes of election \"Sherman moved to allow each state legislature to elect its own senators\". Additionally, in the house Sherman originally proposed that the suffrage of the House of Representatives should be figured according to the \"numbers of free inhabitants\" in each state.\n\nDuring the Constitutional Convention of 1787, summoned into existence to amend the Articles of Confederation, Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth offered what came to be called the Great Compromise or Connecticut Compromise.\n\nIn this plan, designed to be acceptable to both large and small states, the people would be represented proportionally in one branch of the legislature, called the House of Representatives (the lower legislative house). The states would be represented in another house called the Senate (the upper house). In the lower house, each state had a representative for every one delegate. In the upper house each state was guaranteed two senators, regardless of its size.\n\nSherman is also memorable for his stance against paper money with his authoring of and his later opposition to James Madison over the \"Bill of Rights\" amendments to the U.S. Constitution in his belief that these amendments would diminish the role and power of the states over the people.\n\nMr. Wilson & Mr. Sherman moved to insert after the words \"coin money\" the words \"nor emit bills of credit, nor make any thing but gold & silver coin a tender in payment of debts\" making these prohibitions absolute, instead of making the measures allowable (as in the XIII art) with the consent of the Legislature of the U.S. ... Mr. Sherman thought this a favorable crisis for crushing paper money. If the consent of the Legislature could authorize emissions of it, the friends of paper money would make every exertion to get into the Legislature in order to license it.\"\n\nIn terms of the executive Sherman had very little interest in giving the executive much authority. Sherman suggested that no constitutional provision needed be made for the executive because it was \"nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the Legislature into effect\".\n\nOriginally opposed to slavery due to his personal beliefs and puritan views, Sherman used the issue of slavery as a tool for negotiation and alliance. Sherman was of the opinion that slavery was already gradually being abolished and the trend was moving southward. Sherman saw that the issue of slavery could be one that threatened the success of the constitutional convention. Therefore, Sherman decided to help pass legislation to benefit slave states in order to obtain unlikely allies from South Carolina. The two forces joined together because they both, due to the economies of their home states, benefitted from there being no export tax.\n\nSherman opposed appointment of fellow signer Gouverneur Morris as minister to France because he considered that high-living Patriot to be of an \"irreligious nature\".\n\nSherman was instrumental in securing the addition of \"or to the people\" in the wording of the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and caused the cent to be used in the financial system. In a letter to Oliver Wolcott (May 21, 1777) he wrote, \"I think it dangerous to admit citizens not connected to the army to be tried by a Court Martial\".\n\nSherman died in his sleep on July 23, 1793, after a two-month illness diagnosed as typhoid fever. The \"Gazette of the United States\" (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), August 17, 1793, p. 508, reported an alternate diagnosis, \"He was taken ill about the middle of May last, and from that time declined till his death. His physician supposed his disorder to be seated in his liver.\"\n\nHe was buried in New Haven Green. In 1821, when that cemetery was relocated, his remains were moved to the Grove Street Cemetery.\n\nNumerous of Roger Sherman's descendants achieved prominence.\n\nA son, Roger Sherman, Jr. (1768–1856), a 1787 graduate of Yale College, served in the Connecticut General Assembly in 1810–1811.\n\nHis nephew Roger Minott Sherman served as a Connecticut State Representative, 1798; Connecticut State Senator (CT), 1814–1818; and as Judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court, 1840–1844.\n\nHis daughter Rebecca Sherman was married to Simeon Baldwin, US Representative from Connecticut, 1803–1806, and an Associate Judge of the Connecticut Superior Court, 1806–1817, and who later became Mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, in 1826. Following the death of Rebecca Sherman, Baldwin married Rebecca's sister Elizabeth Sherman Burr. Daughter Martha was married to Jeremiah Day who was the President of Yale University from 1817 to 1846. Daughter Mehitabel Sherman was to married Jeremiah Evarts who was secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. His daughter Sarah Sherman was married to Samuel Hoar, who was a member of the Massachusetts state legislature and U.S. Representative from Massachusetts 1835–1837.\n\nThree grandsons Roger Sherman Baldwin, George F. Hoar, and William M. Evarts all served in the U.S. Senate. Baldwin also served as Governor of Connecticut. Evarts also served as United States Secretary of State and United States Attorney General, he was succeeded in that office by a fourth Sherman grandson who served as Massachusetts Supreme Court Chief Justice and United States Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar, who was also the brother George F. Hoar. A fifth grandson Sherman Day served in the California State Senate, 1855–1856; was United States Surveyor General, California, 1868–1871; and was an original trustees of the University of California.\n\nGreat-granddaughter Elizabeth Thacher Kent was an environmentalist and women's suffrage activist. Kent was married to William Kent, U.S. Representative from California 1913 to 1917, who authored the bill establishing the National Park Service and donated the land for Mount Tamalpias State Park and Muir Woods. Great-great-great grandson Theodore Sherman Palmer was also an environmentalist, serving as the vice-president of the American Society of Mammalogists from 1928 to 1934, and a co-founder of the National Audubon Society.\n\nGreat-granddaughter Elizabeth Follansbee was the first woman appointed to a medical school faculty in California, and practiced in Los Angeles from 1883 until soon before her death in 1917.\n\nGreat-grandson Simeon Eben Baldwin was a justice of Connecticut state supreme court, 1897–1907; chief justice of Connecticut Supreme Court, 1907–1910; Governor of Connecticut, 1911–1915; candidate for Democratic nomination for President, 1912; and candidate for U.S. Senator from Connecticut, 1914; Henry Sherman Boutell was a U.S. Representatives from Illinois, 1903–1911; Roger Sherman Greene was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Washington Territory, 1870–1879; Sherman Hoar was a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts, 1891–1893; Rockwood Hoar was a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts, 1905–1906; Edward Baldwin Whitney, was a justice of the First District New York State Supreme Court, 1909–1911; and Sherman Day Thacher was the founder and first headmaster of the elite private boarding school The Thacher School in Ojai, California.\n\nGreat-great-grandsons Roger Kent was Chairman of the California Democratic State Central Committee; and Sherman Kent was one of the founders of the Central Intelligence Agency, pioneering many methods of intelligence analysis. See Sherman Kent School for Intelligence Analysis; and another Roger Sherman Hoar was a Massachusetts state senator and assistant Attorney General.\n\nHusband of his great-great-granddaughter Mabel Wellington White, Henry L. Stimson was Secretary of War under President Taft, Secretary of State under President Hoover, and Secretary of War under both Presidents Roosevelt and Truman. Stimson was the major decision-maker on the atomic bomb and both Presidents followed his advice about using it as the weapon that led to the ultimate end of World War II. Mabel's sister Elizabeth Selden Rogers was chairman of the Advisory Council of the National Woman's Party and its Legislative Chairman for New York, and was one of the most forceful speakers in the \"Prison Special\" bus tour across the country; during which suffragists spoke of their experience in jail. Rogers was arrested, as part of the Silent Sentinels protest, on July 14, 1917, for picketing in front of the United States White House, and was sentenced to sixty days in Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia; but she was quickly pardoned by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson after just three days.\n\nGreat-great-great grandson Archibald Cox served as a U.S. Solicitor General and special prosecutor during President Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal; he was the great-grandson of William M. Evarts.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She comes from a traditional, religious family and grew up in a strict Muslim household. Begum has said she \"grew up caught between two cultures - my traditional culture and values and education and travel and sport.\"\n\nBegum's paternal grandfather moved to the United Kingdom from Sylhet, Bangladesh, to fight for the British in the Second World War.

{"id": "16730989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16730989", "title": "Tom Stevenson", "text": "Tom Stevenson\n\nTom Stevenson (born 1951) is a British author who has been writing about wine for more than 30 years. Described by his colleagues as one of today's most prolific wine authors, Stevenson is regarded as the world's leading authority on Champagne. He has written 23 books, the most important of which have been published internationally by more than 50 publishers and translated into over 25 languages. In 1986, his book \"Champagne\" became the first wine book to win four literary awards, establishing Stevenson's reputation as a serious author, a fastidious researcher with a talent for divining future issues, and a critic bold enough to take on the establishment.\n\nAlthough Stevenson's first writings on wine were published in \"Decanter\" in the late 1970s, a magazine for which he still writes, he was a more prolific contributor to \"WINE Magazine\" for consumers and \"Wine & Spirit International\" for the trade (both since merged into \"Wine & Spirit\") during the 1980s and 1990s. At the time he was well known for his monthly \"Fizz File\" column in \"WINE Magazine\", and for being the sole author of the award winning annual Champagne supplements for both of these magazines.\n\nIn 1998, his \"Christie's World Encyclopedia of Champagne & Sparkling Wine\" became the only wine book to warrant a leader in a UK national newspaper (\"The Guardian\", 14 October 1998), when he published for the first time ever a 17th-century document proving that the English used a second fermentation to convert still wines into sparkling at least six years before Dom Pérignon arrived at the Abbey of Hautvillers, and almost 40 years before the French claim that sparkling Champagne was invented.\n\nStevenson is also regarded as one of the world’s leading experts on Alsace wine. In 1987 he was elected a \"confrère oenophile\" of the Confrérie Saint Etienne, when he was the sole person amongst the Alsace wine producers and other experts present to identify a 50-year-old wine made from Sylvaner. In 1994 Stevenson's 600-page \"The Wines of Alsace\" won the Veuve Clicquot Book of the Year award in the USA and caused Malcolm Gluck, then wine correspondent of \"The Guardian\", to declare that \"It is not simply the best book about Alsace wines ever written, or the most penetrating book about a French wine region ever written; it is the greatest wine book ever written, period\".\n\nStevenson is also the author of several more wide-ranging publications, including \"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\", which is required reading for both Master of Wine and Master Sommelier examinations, and has been published and revised continuously since 1988. In this book, Stevenson has shown that he has the gift of taking vast quantities of knowledge and experience and translating them into lucid, sparkling prose, easily graspable by the novice, yet still interesting and instructive to the connoisseur. With \"The Oxford Companion to Wine\", \"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\" is regarded as one of the essential wine reference books in English.\n\nIn addition to the books authored by Stevenson, he conceived and edited the annual \"Wine Report\", described by Jancis Robinson, MW as \"the most significant entirely new wine book to emerge in 2003\". In August 2009 it was announced by publisher Dorling Kindersley that the 2009 edition of \"Wine Report\" was to be the last, citing that the sales figures were insufficient to justify the fees of the guide's 45 writers, among them Clive Coates, MW and Anthony Rose. \"Wine Report\" was the recipient of \"Best in World\" prizes three times at the Gourmand International Awards, and in 2006 it became the only wine book to be inducted into Gourmand's Hall of Fame (a feat unmatched by other wine books until 2007 when joined by \"The World Atlas of Wine\" and \"Bordeaux et ses Vins\").\n\nOver and above these awards, Stevenson has personally won 31 literary prizes, including \"Wine writer of the year\" three times and the coveted Wine Literary Award, America's only lifetime achievement award for wine writing.\n\nStevenson has been chairman of Champagne and Alsace panels at the \"\"Decanter\" World Wine Awards\" since its inception, and has judged at other major competitions in France, Germany, Greece, Australia and the USA. He presents the Christie's Champagne Masterclass in London ever year (taking it to Singapore one year). He sporadically writes at wine-pages.com, and once away an entire edition of his \"Champagne & Sparkling Wine Guide\" simply because it was late coming out. His Aromas and Flavors resource lists the active chemical compounds responsible for common aromas in wine and has been described as the most helpful tool for delineating wine's attributes since Dr. Anne Noble's Aroma Wheel was devised at UC Davis in 1990.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "501161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=501161", "title": "Will H. Hays", "text": "Will H. Hays\n\nWilliam Harrison Hays Sr. (; November 5, 1879 – March 7, 1954) was a United States politician, chairman of the Republican National Committee (1918–21), U.S. Postmaster General (1921–22), and, from 1922–1945, the first chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). He became the namesake of the 1930 Motion Picture Production Code, informally (and inaccurately) referred to as the Hays Code, which spelled out a set of moral guidelines for the self-censorship of content in Hollywood cinema.\n\nHays was born in Sullivan, Indiana, on November 5, 1879, and attended Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana. He was the manager of Warren G. Harding's successful campaign for the Presidency of the United States in the 1920 election and was subsequently appointed Postmaster General. While serving in the Harding Administration, he became peripherally involved in the Teapot Dome scandal.\n\nOilman Harry Ford Sinclair devised a scheme in which twenty-five cents was diverted from the sale of every barrel of oil sold from the oil field leases that were the focus of the Teapot Dome scandal. Sinclair testified that he \"loaned\" Will H. Hays, then-chairman of the Republican National Committee, $185,000 worth of Liberty Bonds, later getting back $100,000. Sinclair also gave Hays $75,000 as an outright gift to the Committee. At the time, Hays was attempting to pay off the 1920 Republican campaign debt. Hays later approached a number of wealthy men and told them that if they would contribute to pay down the Committee's debt, he would reimburse them for their contributions with Liberty Bonds.\n\nIn 1924, after his resignation from the Harding administration, and while he was serving as President of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Hays was called to testify before the Senate Committee on Public Lands. When asked how much money Sinclair had contributed to the Republican Party, Hays testified that his contribution was $75,000. In 1928, after more details of Sinclair's scheme had emerged, Hays was called to testify again. Hays then told the full story of Sinclair's contribution, including the donation of $185,000 in Liberty Bonds and the $75,000 cash contribution. He stated that he had not mentioned the bonds in his earlier testimony because the Committee \"had not asked about any bonds.\" While there was some public perception that Hays was attempting to conceal Sinclair's large contribution to the Republican National Committee, he testified that he was \"using the bonds to raise money for the deficit.\" \n\nHays resigned his cabinet position on January 14, 1922, to become Chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) shortly after the organization's founding. He began his new job, at a $35,360 annual salary (), on March 6 of that year. There was speculation that he would be paid between $100,000 and $150,000 a year.\n\nThe goal of the organization was to renovate the image of the movie industry in the wake of the scandal surrounding the alleged rape and murder of model and actress Virginia Rappe, of which film star Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle was accused, and amid growing calls by religious groups for federal censorship of the movies. Hiring Hays to \"clean up the pictures\" was, at least in part, a public relations ploy and much was made of his conservative credentials, including his roles as a Presbyterian deacon and past chairman of the Republican Party.\n\nIn his new position in Hollywood, Hays' main roles were to persuade individual state censor boards not to ban specific films outright and to reduce the financial impact of the boards' cuts and edits. At that time, the studios were required by state laws to pay the censor boards for each foot of film excised and for each title card edited; in addition, studios also had the expense of duplicating and distributing separate versions of each censored film for the state or states that adhered to a particular board's decisions.\nHays attempted to reduce studio costs (and improve the industry's image in general) by advising individual studios on how to produce movies to reduce the likelihood that the film would be cut. Each board kept its \"standards\" secret (if, indeed, they had any standardization at all), so Hays was forced to intuit what would or would not be permitted by each board. At first he applied what he called \"The Formula\" but it was not particularly successful; from that he developed a set of guidelines he called \"The Don'ts and Be Carefuls\". In general his efforts at pre-release self-censorship were unsuccessful in quieting calls for federal censorship.\n\nCatholic bishops and lay people tended to be leery of federal censorship and favored the Hays approach of self-censorship; these included the outspoken Catholic layman Martin J. Quigley, publisher of \"Exhibitors Herald-World\" (a trade magazine for independent exhibitors). For several months in 1929, Martin Quigley, Joseph Breen, Father Daniel A. Lord S.J., Father FitzGeorge Dinneen S.J., and Father Wilfred Parsons (editor of Catholic publication \"America\") discussed the desirability of a new and more stringent code of behavior for the movies. With the blessing of Cardinal George W. Mundelein of Chicago, Father Lord authored the code, which later became known as \"The Production Code\", \"The Code\", and \"The Hays Code\". It was presented to Will Hays in 1930 who said, \"My eyes nearly popped out when I read it. This was the very thing I had been looking for\".\n\nThe studio heads were less enthusiastic but they agreed to make The Code the rule of the industry, albeit with many loopholes that allowed studio producers to override the Hays Office's application of it. From 1930 to 1934, the Production Code was only slightly effective in fighting back calls for federal censorship. However, things came to a head in 1934 with widespread threats of Catholic boycotts of \"immoral\" movies, as well as reduced funding from Catholic financiers such as A. P. Giannini of the Bank of America. As a result, the studios granted MPPDA full authority to enforce the Production Code on all studios, creating a relatively strict regime of self-censorship which endured for decades. (The Code was set aside in the 1960s when the MPAA adopted the age-based rating system in force today.) Also in 1934, to deal with \"inappropriate\" industry personnel, alongside the Code's concern with the industry's output, Hays created a list of 117 names of performers whose personal lives he thought made them unfit to appear in films.\n\nHays' philosophy might best be summed up by a statement he reportedly made to a movie director: \"When you make a woman cross her legs in the films, maybe you don't need to see how she can cross them and stay within the law; but how low she can cross them and still be interesting\".\n\nHays faced much international pressure to block film scripts and scenes offensive to foreign nations. Many European nations imposed quotas designed to boost domestic productions over Hollywood imports. A key accomplishment of Hays was his work with the U.S. government, particularly the State Department and the Department of Commerce, in maintaining Hollywood's domination of overseas movie markets.\n\nWhen the entertainment industry started to take off in the early 1920s, thousands of people flocked to Hollywood with hopes of becoming the next big star. These hopefuls were called \"extras\" because they were the extra people who filled out scenes. The main way to find work at this time was to wait outside the gates of studios, hoping production would hire you on the spot. With little regulation on hiring film extras, many people were exploited while looking for work. In an effort to fix the employment issues and exploitation that plagued the industry, Hays commissioned several studies of the employment conditions in Hollywood. After reviewing the results of the studies, Hays created the Central Casting Corporation in 1925 as a way to regulate the hiring of extras in Hollywood.\n\nAfter his retirement, Will H. Hays returned to Sullivan, Indiana, where he died on March 7, 1954. His widow died in 1960.\n\nThe Production Code enumerated three \"General Principles\":\n\n\nSpecific restrictions were spelled out as \"Particular Applications\" of these principles:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "559053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=559053", "title": "William Samuel Johnson", "text": "William Samuel Johnson\n\nWilliam Samuel Johnson (October 7, 1727 – November 14, 1819) was an early American statesman who was notable for signing the United States Constitution, for representing Connecticut in the United States Senate, and for serving as the third president of King's College now known as Columbia University.\n\nWilliam Samuel Johnson was born in Stratford, Connecticut, on October 7, 1727 to Samuel Johnson, a well-known Anglican clergyman and later president of King's (Columbia) College, and Johnson's first wife, Charity Floyd Nicoll. Johnson received his primary education at home. He then graduated from Yale College in 1744, going on to receive a master's degree from his alma mater in 1747 (as well as an honorary degree from Harvard the same year). Although Johnson's father urged him to enter the clergy, Johnson decided to pursue a legal career.Self educated in law he quickly established various business connections. Johnson also held a commission in the Connecticut colonial militia for over 20 years, earning the rank of colonel. He also served in the lower house of the Connecticut legislature years 1761 and 1765. He was also a member of the colonys supreme court years 1772–74. William Samuel Johnson, also attended the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 and served on the committee that addressed the King arguing the right of the colonies to decide tax policies for themselves.\n\nAlthough his father urged him to enter the clergy, Johnson decided instead to pursue a legal career. Self-educated in the law, he quickly developed an important clientele and established business connections extending beyond the boundaries of his native colony. He also held a commission in the Connecticut colonial militia for over 20 years, rising to the rank of colonel, and he served in the lower house of the Connecticut Legislature (1761 and 1765) and in the upper house (1766 and 1771–75). Additionally, he was a member of the colony's Supreme Court (1772–74).\n\nHe was first attracted to the Patriot cause by what he and his associates considered Parliament's unwarranted interference in the government of the colonies. He attended the Stamp Act Congress in 1765, and served on the committee that drafted an address to the King arguing the right of the colonies to decide tax policies for themselves. He opposed the Townshend Acts passed by Parliament in 1767 to pay for the French and Indian War and supported the non-importation agreements devised by the colonies to protest taxation without representation.\n\nJohnson lived in London from 1767 to 1771, serving as Connecticut's agent in its attempt to settle the colony's title to Indian lands. He sharply criticized British policy toward the colonies. His experience in Britain convinced him that Britain's policy was shaped more by ignorance of American conditions and not through the sinister designs of a wicked government, as many Patriots alleged. As the Patriots became more radical in their demands, Johnson found it difficult to commit himself wholeheartedly to the cause. Although he believed British policy unwise, he found it difficult to break his own connections with the mother country. A scholar of international renown, he had many friends in Britain and among the American Loyalists. As the famous English author, Samuel Johnson, said of him, \"Of all those whom the various accidents of life have brought within my notice, there is scarce anyone whose acquaintance I have more desired to cultivate than yours.\" He was also bound to Britain by religious and professional ties. He enjoyed close associations with the Anglican Church in England and with the scholarly community at Oxford, which awarded him an honorary degree in 1766.\n\nFearing the consequences of independence for both the colonies and the mother country, Johnson sought to avoid extremism and to reach a compromise on the outstanding political differences between the protagonists. He rejected his election to the First Continental Congress, a move strongly criticized by the Patriots, who removed him from his militia command. He was also strongly criticized when, seeking an end to the fighting after Lexington and Concord, he personally visited the British commander, General Thomas Gage. The incident led to his arrest for communicating with the enemy, but the charges were eventually dropped. He felt that the American Revolution was not necessary and that independence would be bad for everyone concerned.\n\nOnce independence was achieved, Johnson felt free to participate in the government of the new nation, serving in the Congress of the Confederation (1785–1787). His influence as a delegate was recognized by his contemporaries. Jeremiah Wadsworth wrote of him to a friend, \"Dr. Johnson has, I believe, much more influence than either you or myself. The Southern Delegates are vastly fond of him.\" In 1785, the Vermont Republic granted Johnson a town in the former King's College Tract in thanks for representing the interests of Vermont before the Continental Congress. The town of Johnson, Vermont, the small university Johnson State College, and Johnson Street in Madison, Wisconsin bear his name.\n\nIn 1787, Johnson played a major role as one of the Philadelphia Convention's delegates. His eloquent speeches on the subject of representation carried great weight during the debate. He looked to a strong federal government to protect the rights of Connecticut and the other small states from encroachment by their more powerful neighbors. He supported the New Jersey Plan, which called for equal representation of the states in the national legislature.\n\nIn general, he favored extension of federal authority. He argued that the judicial power \"ought to extend to equity as well as law\" (the words \"in law and equity\" were adopted at his motion). The inflexibility of the law had to be tempered by fairness. He denied that there could be treason against a separate state since sovereignty was \"in the Union.\" He opposed prohibition of any ex post facto law, one which made an act a criminal offense retroactively, because such prohibition implied \"an improper suspicion of the National Legislature.\"\n\nJohnson was influential even in the final stages of framing the Constitution. He gave his fullest support to the Connecticut Compromise, which foreshadowed the final Great Compromise, with a national legislature with a Senate that provided equal representation for all states and a House of Representatives based on population. He also served on and chaired the five-member Committee of Style, which framed the final form of the document.\n\nIn \"Miracle at Philadelphia\", Catherine Drinker Bowen called Johnson \"the perfect man to preside over these four masters of argument and political strategy [i.e. fellow committee members Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, James Madison, and Rufus King]... His presence on the committee must have been reassuring; the doctor's quiet manner disarmed.\"\n\n"}

Thereafter he has been credited for his solo work as Yoni Wolf.\n\nPrior to the founding of the band Why? in 2004, Wolf had also been a member of numerous other groups, including Greenthink, Clouddead, Reaching Quiet and Hymie's Basement.\n\nWolf was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to Messianic Jewish parents. Before his first year in high school, he discovered an old 4-track in his father's synagogue and began to experiment musically. His forays into rapping, drumming, and poetry followed.\n\nIn 1997, while attending art school at the University of Cincinnati, Wolf met fellow student Adam Drucker, aka Doseone, at the semifinals of Scribble Jam. Along with Doseone, Mr. Dibbs and his brother Josiah Wolf, he formed the live improvisational group Apogee. The partnership of Wolf and Doseone continued for many years under many guises.\nIn 1998 the duo released the album \"It's Not Easy Being...\" under the name Greenthink. In 1999, with an expansive roster of featured guests, they released the second Greenthink record \"Blindfold\", after which they expanded to a trio with the addition of producer Odd Nosdam and adopted the name Clouddead. In the same year Wolf released his first solo album under the name Why?, entitled \"Part Time People Cage... or Part Time Key?\".\n\nBeginning in 2000, Clouddead released a series of six 10\" vinyl singles on Mush Records. In 2001 these singles were compiled on CD and released as the group's self-titled debut album.\n\nFollowing the release of his album \"Oaklandazulasylum\" in 2003, Wolf enlisted Josiah Wolf on drums, Matt Meldon on guitar, and Doug McDiarmid as a multi-instrumentalist. Wolf decided to transfer his alias onto the new band, and Why? was officially formed.\n\nIn 2005, Why? released their debut album \"Elephant Eyelash\". The album deviated considerably from the sound of Wolf's prior solo work. The group toured much of 2005 in support of the album as a four-piece. However, by the time of their May 2006 tour with Islands, the group had become a three-piece, as Meldon moved to an island off the coast of Seattle to live with his girlfriend.\n\nFor their second album \"Alopecia\", Why? asked their fans to contribute photographs of their palms for the album's artwork. They released \"The Hollows\" as the first single, with two different European and US versions, featuring remixes and covers by Boards of Canada, Xiu Xiu, Dntel, Half-handed Cloud, Dump and Islands. \"Alopecia\" was released in 2008 to very positive reviews.\n\nIn 2009, Why? released their third album \"Eskimo Snow\". The ten songs on the album were recorded during the \"Alopecia\" sessions and are described by Wolf as \"the least hip-hop out of anything I've ever been involved with.\"\n\nOn June 27, 2012, the band announced via Stereogum that they would be releasing their new EP \"Sod in the Seed\" on August 13 on City Slang. In the same article they premiered the title track. The song is more upbeat than any of the tracks on \"Eskimo Snow\" and contains rapping, which had been absent on the previous album.\n\nThe band released their fourth album, \"Mumps, Etc.\" on October 9, 2012.\n\nWolf suffers from Crohn's disease and many of his lyrics describe his efforts to cope with the illness.\n\nWolf has produced tracks for other MCs. He produced several tracks for fellow Anticon co-founder Pedestrian's album \"\" in 2005. He also produced several tracks for Serengeti's album \"Family and Friends\", as well as providing backup vocals, in 2011.\n\nWolf has released many albums as a member of groups including Reaching Quiet, Hymie's Basement, Miss Ohio's Nameless and Object Beings. He has collaborated with Doseone, Odd Nosdam, Fog among others. In 2017, he convinced his label to put out The Ophelias' debut LP, and he produced their sophomore LP, \"Almost\", the following year which was also released on Joyful Noise.\n\nSolo\n\nWhy?\n\nClouddead \n\nGreenthink \n\nOther collaborations \n\n"}

Soon after it was founded the Y.P.C.U. focused its attention on missionary work. It was instrumental in the founding of new southern churches and the creation of a Post Office Mission for the distribution of religious literature.\n\nInitially organized as an auxiliary to the Universalist General Convention, the Y.P.C.U. developed an independent identity. It held its own yearly conventions, published a magazine (\"Onward\"), implemented funding mechanisms and elected officers.\n\nIn 1941, the Young People's Christian Union was re-organized as the Universalist Youth Fellowship. In 1953, the Universalists and Unitarian youth organizations merged to form the Liberal Religious Youth (LRY). After the merger in 1961 of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America, LRY was re-organized as the Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU).\n\nThe inspiration for the Young People's Christian Union can be traced to the founding of the Young Men's Christian Association (Y.M.C.A.) in England.\n\nGeorge Williams after entering the drapery business in 1841 formed a mutual improvement society with fellow workers. The aim of the society was Bible study and support of missionary efforts. Three year later, Williams and twelve other young men formalized the mission of their support group as the “improvement of the spiritual condition of young men engaged in the drapery and other trades.” Membership was later extended to anyone who was “a member of a Christian church” or gave “sufficient evidence of his being a converted character.” They called their new society the Young Men's Christian Association (Y.M.C.A.).\n\nBy 1855 there were 8,500 Y.M.C.A members in Great Britain. The American version of the Y.M.C.A. soon spread during a period of heightened religious activity called the Third Great Awakening (1850s – 1900).\n\nIn 1860, Rev. Dr. Theodore L. Cuyler, minister of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York, became aware of the success of the Y.M.C.A. to gather young men for prayer meetings, but that the Y.M.C.A. had not succeeded in organizing them for more sustained Christian work in the church. To address this situation, on November 6, 1867, Rev. Cuyler organized the Young People's Association (YPA). Cuyler's YPA was designed to focus the energy of young men on long term church work such as “the conversion of souls, the development of Christian character and the training of converts in religious work.”\n\nSome years later, Rev. Dr. Francis E. Clark, pastor of the Williston Congregational Church in Portland, Maine, visited the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church. In 1892 he reflected back on his impression of the Young People's Association stating it “was certainly an inspiration to the first Christian Endeavor Society.”\n\nDuring a monthly Week of Prayer, Rev. Clark observed that similar to the Y.M.C.A. model, the Week of Prayer gathered young people for Christian devotion but afterwards they soon departed. Clark had relied for years upon prevailing wisdom that entertainment, mutual improvement and literary societies would sustain young people's interest in Christian church work. After five year of such efforts, Rev. Clark had little to show.\n\nClark abandoned the “low expectations” model and opted instead to raise the expectations of the religious obligations of young people. His youth organization would be first and foremost a Christian society. Musical soirees and literary readings may follow, but they would be subordinate to the larger mission of seeking the kingdom of God. On February 2, 1881 Rev. Clark proposed his new society and secured the signature of forty to fifty young people to the constitution of an organization called the Christian Endeavor Society.\n\nAdditional societies soon followed in Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts. The absence of a denomination designation enabled a Christian Endeavor Society to be organized within any church denomination. Five years after the organization of the first Christian Endeavor Society, there were 850 societies representing eight denominations from 33 states and seven countries.\n\nOthers followed Rev. Clark's model, but created youth groups that were specifically denominationally branded: the Baptist Young's People's Union (1891), the Luther League (1896), the Universalist Young People's Christian Union (1889), the Unitarian Young People's Religious Union (1896) and the Methodist Epworth League (1899).\n\nThe Universalists, not having made any earlier effort to create a unifying national youth organization, discovered that within the denomination there were more than 120 young people's societies including 38 Christian Endeavor Societies and others with names such as “Christian Union,” “Christian Culture,” and “Christian Work.”\n\nThis situation was addressed at the 1886 Chicago General Convention with a proposal to create a national youth society called the Young People's Missionary Association (Y.P M.A.). The proposal called for the formation of parish level associations designed as auxiliaries to state conventions. After the convention, the Y.P.M.A. saw some initial success. More than 20 such organizations were formed, but the Y.P.M.A. did not have wide appeal. Existing youth groups resisted joining the Y.P.M.A. preferring to retain their individual social or literary charters.\n\nTwo years later, in 1888, Rev. Stephen H. Roblin revived the idea of a distinctively Universalist nationwide youth group.\n\nShortly after his ordination in 1882, Rev. Roblin assumed the pastorate at the Universalist church in Victor, New York. His experience with his church's Christian Endeavor Society as well as his personal connection with Rev. L.B. Fisher and James D. Tillinghast, publishers of a New York State monthly journal called the \"Universalist Union\", would contribute to the reboot of a Universalist youth organization.\n\nSix years later, in 1888, Rev. Roblin had relocated to Michigan to assume the pastorate of the Universalist church in Bay City. Since his new church did not have a youth group, Rev. Roblin appointed Alfred J. Cardall to form a Christian Endeavor Society. Also closely associated with the formation of this Christian Endeavor Society was Albert G. Grier, a principal in the local school system.\n\nAs he organized his local youth group Roblin became curious about denominational support for a revised national youth society. Roblin recruited Cardall and Grier, who has just formed the local Bay City Christian Endeavor Society, and Fisher and Tillinghast, publishers of the \"Universalist Union\", to conduct a correspondence campaign. They contacted Universalist youth groups to ascertain their interest in a Universalist national youth organization. If interested, youth groups were encouraged to send delegates to an organizing meeting to take place a day before the General Convention in Lynn, Massachusetts.\n\nOn October 22, 1889, 131 delegates representing 56 societies from 13 states attended the First National Convention of Universalist Young People. By-laws and a constitution for the Young People's Christian Union (Y.P.C.U.) were drafted. The mission of the Y.P.C.U. was “to promote an earnest Christian life among young people of the Universalist Church, and the sympathetic union of all young people’s societies in their efforts to make themselves more useful in the service of God.” The \"Universalist Union\" was adopted as the official press organ of the Y.P.C.U.\n\nThe Lynn General Convention approved the youth group's by-laws and constitution. There was, however, those who opposed the formation of the youth group arguing that no intermediate organization should stand between the church and its people. The opposition insisted that youth groups must be designated as auxiliaries or subordinates to the General Convention and adult supervision must be exercised over the Y.P.C.U.\n\nNonetheless, over time, the new youth group acquired the profile of an independent organization. In 1893, The Y.P.C.U. assumed responsibility for the publication of the \"Universalist Union,\" changing the name to \"Onward,\" and modified the format from a monthly to weekly magazine. By 1894 the Y.P.C.U. began holding their conventions independently from those of the General Convention. The Y.P.C.U. also acquired other independent trappings such Y.P.C.U. branded colors (blue for truth, white for purity), motto (For Christ and His Church), hymn (\"Follow the Gleam\") and watchword (Onward!).\n\nDespite having a national profile, the Y.P.C.U. was at its core a local institution. Churches sponsored a local Y.P.C.U. group that, in turn, was affiliated with a state Y.P.C.U. organization. The local groups could then voluntarily affiliate with the national organization. Also loosely defined was the term \"young.\" It was not uncommon in the early days of the Y.P.C.U. for individuals in their thirties or older to be a member of the local Y.P.C.U. For the truly young, a Junior Y.P.C.U. concept was introduced in 1894 with Mary Grace Canfield being appointed as its first national superintendent. Finally, to provide an organizational structure for young Universalists who did not have a local church community, the Union at Large concept was introduced in 1892 with Sarah B. Hammond being appointed its first national superintendent.\n\nAt its first convention in Rochester, New York in 1890, the Y.P.C.U. turned its focus to missionary work. This focus on missionary work shaped the actions taken by the Y.P.C.U. in the following years by the appointment of its first missionary, Rev. William H. McGlauflin; granting its secretary a salary; adopting a temperance position; organizing a Post Office Mission for the distribution of religious literature; establishing a funding mechanism called the Two Cent a Week for Missions; explicitly denominationally rebranding the group by appending \"of the Universalist Church\" to the group's name; and the appointment of Rev. Quillen H. Shinn as their National Organizer.\n\nThe first missionary action taken by the Y.P.C.U. was accepting the responsibility to build of a new Universalist church in Harriman, Tennessee.\n\nDespite being operational for only one year, building a new church, given the economic situation in Harriman, was a plausible objective for the Y.P.C.U. Harriman was barely a town in early 1890, but growth was almost assured. Northern businessmen through the Tennessee Land Company were making substantial investments in Harriman to exploit abundant coal, iron, timber and limestone resources. Rev. Henry L. Canfield, State Superintendent of Churches and Sunday Schools of Ohio and Rev. C. Ellwood Nash, then pastor at a Universalist church in Akron, Ohio encouraged the Harriman missionary project. They argued that in Harriman the Universalists would be the religious vanguard in a burgeoning new city instead of trailing along as late-comers \n\nFurthermore, Rev. Nash had visited Harriman prior to the Rochester convention. Nash was aware that there were a number of Universalists already in the area and that other conditions in Harriman were favorable to Y.P.C.U. The East Tennessee Land Company, for example, provided Nash two land lots for a Universalist church. The town's charter with its explicit prohibition on liquor closely aligned with Y.P.C.U. temperance sensibilities. This commitment to temperance was further fortified by the East Tennessee Land Company's plan to construct an institute of higher learning in the city called The American Temperance University.\n\nAdding to these social and economic incentives was financial support offered by Ferdinand Schumacher. A rich German immigrant known as the “oatmeal king,” Schumacher, from Ohio, was a Universalist and temperance advocate. Schumacker pledged $1,000 to the church building fund if the Universalists raised $4,000.\n\nThe cornerstone to the Grace Universalist Church in Harriman was laid on December 2, 1891. The church was formally dedicated on Easter Sunday, April 17, 1892 with a sermon preached by Rev. Henry L. Canfield. By 1895, the debt free church had 140 members. The Y.P.C.U. would soon deliver the deed of the church to the General Convention and turn its attention to its next missionary effort in Atlanta.\n\nAs the Y.P.C.U. turned its attention to Atlanta in 1895, the fortunes of the Grace Universalist Church reflected the economic downward trajectory of Harriman. Church membership decreased after its first pastor, Rev. W.H. McGlauflin, departed. More misfortune befell the church when McGlauflin's replacement, Rev. Harry Lawrence Veazey and his wife tragically died in New York State. Rev. Charles R. East, the next pastor, became disheartened and departed. Eleven years after its dedication, even the ever-optimistic Rev. Shinn declared the church dead. An ex-Baptist who joined the Universalist church, Rev. John M. Rasanke, attempted to revive the church, but he too departed in 1904. Several years of dormancy followed.\n\nAfter World War I, the Universalist Women's National Missionary Association (WNMA) took over responsibility for Tennessee. The WNMA reported in the October issue of the \"Universalist Leader\" that the Harriman church, once on the dormant list, was now active with Rev. William E. Manning serving as pastor. However, it would have been more accurate to report that Rev. Manning had only included Harriman on his 1920 – 1921 missionary circuit. The WNMA abandoned the church property in 1923 and the General Convention trustees sold the property in 1927 for $2,500. The old church building was torn down in 1932.\n\nIn the summer f 1879, Rev. W.C. Bowman attempted to establish a Universalist church in Atlanta. The Universalists had a presence in the Georgia countryside, but had not established a presence in any urban city. Bowman's missionary work continued until 1881 when he severed his connection with the Universalists and joined the city's spiritualism movement. Rev. D.B. Clayton, who had moved to Atlanta from his South Carolina home to assist Bowman, continued services until the summer of 1882. Afterwards there was no active Universalist presence in the city. Also in 1882, the Unitarians began active missionary work in Atlanta that provided Universalists a temporary religious home.\n\nIn 1895, emboldened by their apparent success in Harriman, the Y.P.C.U. turned its attention to Atlanta, Georgia. Three ministers were recruited to raise a Universalist church in Atlanta: Rev. Shinn, then the new Y.P.C.U. National Organizer, Rev. D.B. Clayton, who had been involved in the city's initial missionary work and Rev. McGlauflin, the Y.P.C.U. Southern Missionary and former Harriman pastor. They succeeded and established First Universalist Church of Atlanta in 1895 with Rev. McGlauflin becoming the first pastor of the new church.\n\nIn 1897, to encourage fund raising for a new church building, the Y.P.C.U. pledged to raise $4.00 for each dollar raised by Atlanta's Universalists. The Y.P.C.U. was also instrumental in retiring the $2,500 mortgage on the building lot. On July 15, 1900, the Universalists dedicated a new church building at 16 East Harris Street.\n\nThe Y.P.C.U. invested over $16,000 in the Atlanta effort and subsequently transferred the property deed to the Georgia Universalist convention.\n\nRev. W.H. McGlauflin remained pastor of the Atlanta church for nine years. He resigned in 1904 to become the superintendent the Universalist churches in Minnesota. After Rev. McGlauflin most pastorates lasted between one and two years. The only exception was the pastorate of Rev. E. Dean Ellenwood who served the church from 1905 to 1913.\n\nDespite the growth of Atlanta's population, the Atlanta Universalist congregation remained small.\n\nDriven by the general weakness of Atlanta's two liberal churches, the Unitarians and Universalists merged in 1918. The combined congregation, named the Liberal Christian Church, chose the Unitarian church building on West Peachtree Street as their common home. The Universalist church on East Harris Street was sold in April 1920. The Unitarian-Universalist congregation continued until 1951 when the congregation collapsed.\n\nIn 1952, the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America renewed efforts in Atlanta. A new church called the United Liberal Church was established in 1954 and witnessed rapid growth. The church was later renamed the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta.\n\nShortly after the dedication of the Atlanta church, at its 1901 Rochester Convention the Y.P.C.U. selected St. Paul, Minnesota and Little Rock, Arkansas as their next missionary projects. Like Atlanta, St. Paul had seen earlier Universalist missionary activity that was unable to sustain a permanent presence.\n\nThe First Universalist Society of St. Paul was incorporated in 1865. Rev. Herman A. Bisbee briefly served as the society's first minister before he accepted a call in November 1866 to the Universalist church in nearby St. Anthony, Minnesota. Nonetheless, the First Universalist Society of St. Paul continued to operate.\n\nIn June 1866 the society purchased land on Wabasha Street. In October 1867 ground for a new church was broken and by January 1869 the basement of the building was sufficiently completed to allow services to be held. The building was completed and formally dedicated October 1, 1872. The society, however, was unable to sustain operations. In 1879 The \"Universalist Register\" began listing the St. Paul society as dormant.\n\nThe Universalist church property was sold in 1881 to the French Catholics also known as the St. Louis Church. and the St. Paul Universalist society virtually disappeared.\n\nIn early 1886, the society was revived when Rev. L.D. Boynton from Minneapolis conducted Sunday services in an old Baptist Church on Wacouta Street two to three times a month. In December in that same year, Rev. W.S. Vail assumed the pastorate of the small St. Paul society. Rev. Vail's seven-year ministry significantly raised the fortunes of the Universalists. Upon Rev. Vail's resignation in November 1893, \"The Universalist Register\" yearbook showed that the once moribund society now counted 125 families among its flock.\n\nWith Rev. Vail's departure, the society once again experienced a period of near dormancy. From 1895 to 1900, \"The Universalist Register\" showed either no minister or simply dropped the society from its inventory of churches. However, based on a review of newspaper announcements in the \"St. Paul Globe\" during this period, the Ladies Aid Society of the First Universalist Church continued to hold the small liberal community together.\n\nA prelude to another revival of the St. Paul society occurred in the summer of 1898. While on his summer break from his pastorate of the Atlanta Unitarian church, Rev. Vail, the former St. Paul pastor, provided pulpit supply for St. Paul's People's Church. At a reception held for Rev. Vail, over 150 people attended and there was discussion of formally reorganizing the society. A hopeful sign was that even without a permanent minister, local Universalists had raised a “goodly sum” of money to establish a permanent Universalist presence in the city.\n\nFollowing the selection of St. Paul as a missionary project, the Y.P.C.U. organ \"Onward\" announced on August 6, 1901 that Rev. Henry B. Taylor had accepted the pastorate to the fledgling St. Paul society. Unioners were implored to support this new missionary project. “Unless every member of our Union consecrates himself as a helper by a Two-Cents-a-Week pledge….the good work will not hasten forward as we desire.” \n\nDuring Rev. Taylor's pastorate (1901 – 1908) the Y.P.C.U. provided funds for the minister's salary, helped reduce the churches indebtedness and raised additional funds for the purchase of church property at the corner of Ashland and Mackubin. In 1909 the Y.P.C.U. held their convention at the larger the Church of the Redeemer in Minneapolis. The Unioners traveled to St. Paul for the dedication of the new church now under the pastorate of Rev. Thomas S. Robjent.\n\nOver the course of their missionary effort in St.Paul, the Y.P.C.U. contributed more than $16,000.\n\nIn 1916, the Y.P.C.U. executive board voted to transfer the oversight of the St. Paul church to the trustees of the Universalist General Convention. The General Convention, in turn, requested that the Y.P.C.U. assume missionary responsibilities for the Los Angeles, California church. This exchange ended the Y.P.C.U involvement with St. Paul.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Unioners at their 1901 Rochester Convention had selected St. Paul and Little Rock as their missionary projects.\n\nFive years prior to the Y.P.C.U. intervention in 1896, Rev. Shinn had conducted missionary work in Little Rock. Shinn's missionary work typically focused on establishing Universalist structures such as a Sunday school and Ladies Universalist Society as a prelude to placing a permanent minister. Notices posted in the \"Daily Arkansas Gazette\" showed that Universalist Sunday school was regularly held in 1899 in rented space at the Congregational Church at the corner of Eleventh and Main Streets.\n\nIn 1902, Rev. F.L. Carrier was recruited by the Y.P.C.U. to serve as minister to the Little Rock church At the time the church had 29 members. The Y.P.C.U. also committed to contributing $500 a year to the pastor's salary.\n\nRev. Carrier held regular Sunday services in the rented space in the Congregational Church on Eleventh and Main until December 1903 when the Congregational Church sold the building to the Universalists. Thereafter, newspaper articles referred to this building as the Universalist Church on Eleventh and Main.\n\nIn 1904, Rev. Carrier resigned and was succeeded by Rev. Athalia Lizzie Johnson Irwin an Arkansas native. Rev. Athalia L.J. Irwin was born in 1862 to the Baptist faith, but left that denomination by July 1898. Befriending Rev. Q.H. Shinn she was encouraged to became a Universalist minister. Her first church in Pensacola, Florida ordained her in 1902. In October 1904, she left her Pensacola church to assume the pastorate in Little Rock.\n\nThe Y.P.C.U. continued its financial support by providing money for the minister's salary and $6,000 toward a building fund. In 1905 a small chapel was constructed at the corner of Thirteenth and Center Streets. This chapel became known as the Cottage Chapel.\n\nRev. Athalia L.J. Irwin was a gifted writer and orator. The local newspaper frequently printed summaries of her sermons with titles such as \"The God We Believe In\" and \"The Bible We Accept\". However, she garnered the most press coverage when she challenged her brother, Rev. M. Gray Johnson, a Baptist minister from Ohio to a debate in the Cottage Chapel. When debating the topic “The Christ We Would Follow,” Rev. Irwin energetically rejected the doctrine of the Trinity “as unreasonable and as something which Christ never meant to imply.” She went on to emphasis God's love and that God “wills that not any should perish, but that all should come to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus.”\n\nIn spite of her many talents, the Little Rock church remained small. When Rev. Irwin departed in September 1908, there were fewer than 40 members. The Universalist State Superintendent Rev. G.E. Cunningham filled the empty pulpit, vowing to remain until a successor was found. Rev. Cunningham continued to provide pastoral services to the small society until he moved to Illinois in late 1912.\n\nRev. H.C. Ledyard succeeded Cunningham and remained as the pastor for three years, departing in December 1915. Lay members and guest speakers conducted Sunday services for several years, . By mid 1919, Sunday services ceased. The Cottage Chapel, now referred to as the First Universalist Church, was only being used as rental space for third party events.\n\nBy 1922, there was no mention of the First Universalist church in local newspapers. The church property was sold in 1930. In 1950, a new Universalist society was established and became known as the Unitarian Universalist Church of Little Rock.\n\nIn 1909 the Y.P.C.U. turned its missionary zeal toward Chattanooga, Tennessee, which was the last major church building effort by the youth group.\n\nAs early as 1895 Rev. McGlauflin, the Southern Missionary in Harriman, Tennessee had visited Chattanooga, but no permanent church was founded. Rev. Q.H. Shinn, who visited Chattanooga just a few months prior to his death in September 1907, launched a new church in that city chartered with 32 members. For 17 months the new church was without a permanent minister. Atlanta's Rev. E. Dean Ellenwood, the Universalist General Superintendent, Rev. H.W. McGlauflin and other ministers offered temporary preaching services.\n\nIn late November 1908 under the direction of McGlauflin, Rev. L.R. Robinson was installed as the joint pastor for the Harriman and Chattanooga churches. Since there was a parsonage in Harriman, that city was selected as the pastor's home.\n\nRobinson was born into a Methodist Episcopal family but came to Universalism through his reading of the Bible. “I found so many Scriptural passages that seemed to clearly teach the final harmony of all souls with God.” Robinson requested Universalist literature from the Post Office Mission and later met Rev. H.W. McGlauflin. Encouraged by McGlauflin, Robinson, in the fall of 1908, accepted a position to serve the Universalist churches in Harriman and Chattanooga.\n\nRobinson provided Sunday service two times a month in Chattanooga. Under his ministry membership grew and financial obligations were addressed. In February 1910, the Y.P.C.U. selected Rev. L. R. Robinson as their “consecrated missionary” in Chattanooga and Robinson moved to that city accordingly.\n\nAbout the time that Robinson was exploring fellowship with the Universalists, Chattanooga became the focal point of a multi-year search for a site to build a church to honor Rev. Q.H. Shinn who had died in late 1907. Southern Universalists quickly established the Shinn Memorial Association to raise funds for the construction of a church in a southern state to commemorate Shinn's southern missionary work. The selection process continued for several years with the Y.P.C.U. supporting Chattanooga.\n\nIn 1911, four possible locations for the construction of a Shinn Memorial church were discussed at the General Convention: Houston, Texas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Chattanooga, Tennessee and Rocky Mount, North Carolina. At the convention the Y.P.C.U. continued its support for Chattanooga arguing that it was in this city “where the Union is supporting a promising mission.”\n\nOn July 7, 1914 it was announced that Chattanooga had been selected at the site for the Shinn Memorial Church. Three weeks later, a front-page article in the August 1, 1914 edition of \"Onward\", Unioners were implored “Let the slogan ‘Chattanooga and Work’ be ours for the coming year. This Y.P.C.U. ‘Chattanooga and Work’ campaign was designed to raise the thousands of dollars still needed for the Shinn Memorial Church building fund.\n\nServices were first held in the new Shinn Memorial Church in the summer 1916. The church was dedicated during the 1917 Y.P.C.U. convention held in that city.\n\nWith the construction of the new church, one of Shinn's lifetime ambitions was finally realized. In 1917, a School of Evangelism was opened. The goal of the school was to provide ministerial training to those who were unable to attend regular Universalist theological schools. The school continued to operate until the 1930s.\n\nThe church also became the headquarters in 1919 for the Southern Universalist Young People's Institute. The institute's summer programs were designed to train workers for service in Sunday schools, young people's societies and missionary work. A year later the Y.P.C.U. turned over its roll in the institute to the Universalist's Women's National Missionary Association (WNMA). In 1925 when the pastor of the Chattanooga church, Rev. George A. Gay, moved to Camp Hill, Alabama, he took the institute with him. The institute, however, returned to Chattanooga in 1930.\n\nIn spite of starting with a surplus of funds after the church was built, the congregation frequently had financial trouble and had to depend on denominational aid. It had trouble finding and keeping good ministers, and its lay leadership was frequently divided. In its final years, it ignored the interest in establishing a Unitarian fellowship in Chattanooga. By 1951, there were only four active members, and services were suspended. The congregation is last listed in the Universalist Directory for 1956 - 1957.\n\nWithin three years of its formation in 1892 at their Reading, Pennsylvania convention, Rev. Shinn urged the Y.P.C.U. to organize a Post Office Mission. The Post Office Mission was designed to supplement the influence of Universalist ministers and the denomination's periodicals. In a front-page article in the February 1895 edition of \"Onward\" it was argued that, “The voice of the minister is heard but a few feet from the pulpit, and the message of the denomination through our papers reaches almost exclusively those who are already acquainted with the message, and is even reaching too few of them. To extend the light into the dark places and to proclaim the gospel of our church where hitherto no voice has been raised in its behalf is the sphere of this mission.” The Post Office Mission was primarily organized at a local level. Local societies were tasked with identifying names for mailings with the national organization providing oversight coordination.\n\nUnderstanding the opportunities inherent in the 1895 Atlanta Cotton Exposition and 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition, booths were secured by the Post Office Mission at both events to distribute literature and collect names for the mailing list.\n\nThe Atlanta Cotton Exposition coincided with the resumption of missionary work in Atlanta and the Y.P.C.U. Post Office Mission embarked on a “Shall We Bombard Atlanta?” campaign. “From all over the South people are gathering, and in the month of December the exposition grounds will be thronged. How can we reach this multitude and plant in their minds some seed of Universalist philosophy?” Not only was literature distributed at the Exposition booth, but 187 names were also added to the Post Office Mission mailing list. \nThe Post Office Mission relied on local Y.P.C.U. societies not only to maintain mailing lists but to cover the cost of postage and other distribution expenses. To defray their overall cost, the Y.P.C.U. Post Office Mission relied on the Universalist Publishing House to provide the literature at little or no cost. The cost for the production of the literature having been covered by a bequest from the late entertainer and showman, P.T. Barnum, and other donations.\n\nThe national level Post Office Mission leadership encouraged local Unions to maintain literature tables or racks in the vestibule of their churches. Local societies were additionally encouraged to find public places such as railway stations where literature could be made available to the public. Unioners were implored that “Through the Post Office Mission everyone who takes up the work becomes a heralder of the truth.”\n\nInterest and support for the Y.P.C.U. Post Office Mission declined by the earlier 1920s. Contributing to the decline was the continued need for local funds and the inability to concretely measure the Post Office Mission's success. The national level Post Office Mission Superintendent Clifford R. Stetson noted in October 1920 that “the Post Office Mission could not be measured in definite terms.” He went on to recommend that the function of the Post Office Mission “to sow the seed, trusting that the fruit would follow” be transferred to another department called the Union-at-Large. The Union at Large had been formed in 1892 to support Universalist youth in areas where no local Y.P.C.U. chapter had been formed. Following the transfer, the Y.P.C.U. Post Office Mission ceased to exist.\n\nThe 41st annual Y.P.C.U. convention held in the United Liberal Church of Atlanta, a joint Unitarian-Universalist congregation, was “one of tension and crisis from beginning to end.” The youth group faced shrinking membership, increasing deficits, an uncertain future for \"Onward\" and needed to answer the question of merger with the Unitarian Young People's Religious Union (Y.P.R.U.).\n\nThe problem with \"Onward\" was addressed by changing its format back to a monthly magazine with a four-page limit focused on news bulletins and less on “abstract articles…little read and little needed.”\n\nAction was taken with considerable opposition to change the convention from an annual to a biennial format. In 1933 the Y.P.C.U. had its lowest individual membership of less than 2,000 with less than 100 local unions and only 10 junior unions.\n\nAlso in the early 1930s Max A. Kapp president of the Universalist's Y.P.C.U. and Dana Greeley president of the Unitarian Y.P.R.U. discussed a merger or federation of the two groups. However, no action was taken until the Unitarians made an overt offer to merge in 1935. Opposition was strong within the Y.P.C.U. It was argued that the Unitarian Y.P.R.U was no better equipped to address youth needs. The Universalists voted to defer action for another year. The deferral period actually continued for many years with no definitive merger action being taken during World War II (1941-1945.)\n\nThe Y.P.C.U. continued an internal examination. In 1941 at the poorly attended Y.P.C.U. convention in Oak Park, Illinois, the youth group reorganized as the Universalist Youth Fellowship (UYF). The re-organized youth group introduced several changes. Its membership focus was narrowed to youth between 13 and 25. The new organization would no longer appeal to state unions for funding. Rather, funding would be based on investment income and other funds raised by the Universalist Church of America Unified Appeal.\n\nManpower demands from World War II significantly diminished the UYF leadership ranks that came primarily from those preparing for the ministry at Tufts College. Work with youth and students understandably came to a virtual standstill. The UYF budget for 1943-1944 was just $3,300.\n\nDespite demurring on the 1935 proposal to merge, the Universalist and Unitarian youth did act jointly. In late 1945 they cooperated on the publication on two small magazine-size digests called \"Youth for Action\" that focused on social service. In the fall of 1945, as the bi-monthly publication of \"Onward\" came to an end, they also conducted a two-year experiment with a joint publication called \"The Young Liberal\". This post war Universalist – Unitarian publication became a platform supporting relief efforts in devastated European countries. The publication regularly contained appeals to feed starving Czech and Dutch people and photographs of students rebuilding Stalingrad. In 1947 the Universalists withdrew their support from the magazine that then had only 200 subscribers.\n\nThe Universalists in that same year turned their attention to the publication of \"The Youth Leader\". The publication changed formats several times but lasted three years beyond the formal merger of the Universalists and Unitarians in 1961.\n\nTen years prior to the merger of the Universalists and Unitarians, the two denominational youth groups took final steps toward merger at a convention held in 1951 at Lake Winnepesaukee, New Hampshire. Three years later, in 1953, the two youth groups completed the merger discussions started in 1935 and formed the Liberal Religious Youth (LRY).\n\nAfter the merger in 1961 of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America, LRY was re-organized as the Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU).\n"}

{"id": "732725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=732725", "title": "Zhu Yu (artist)", "text": "Zhu Yu (artist)\n\nZhu Yu ( 朱昱 b. 1970) is a performance artist living in Beijing, China. Zhu graduated from the Affiliated High School of the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1991. His work deals with subjects of contemporary art.\n\nZhu Yu is often termed the most controversial and criticized artist in China. Zhu graduated from the Affiliated High School of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1991. His contemporary performance art raises questions about moral agendas, and draws an audience through its shock value. His artwork often encompasses the human body. He is categorized by some critics as an artist of the “cadaver school,” which consists of artists who tend to use human body parts in their work. Yu's most famous piece of conceptual art, titled \"Eating People,\" was performed at a Shanghai arts festival in 2000. It consisted of him cooking and eating what is alleged to be a human fetus. The picture, circulated on the internet via e-mail in 2001, provoked investigations by both the FBI and Scotland Yard. It was intended as \"shock art\". Snopes and other urban legend sites have said the \"fetus\" used by Zhu Yu was most likely constructed from a duck's body and a doll head. Other images from another art exhibit were falsely circulated along with Zhu Yu's photos and claimed to be evidence of fetus soup. The piece's cannibalistic theme caused a stir in Britain when Yu's work was featured on a Channel 4 documentary exploring Chinese Contemporary Art in 2003. In response to the public reaction, Mr. Yu stated, \"No religion forbids cannibalism. Nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people. I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it\". Yu has claimed that he used an actual fetus which was stolen from a medical school. He was prosecuted for his deeds.\n\nImages from the piece have also been used in anti-Chinese propaganda, disseminated by e-mail with a short text attached explaining the images show China's \"hottest food\" and that dead fetuses can be bought for 10-12,000 Yen (approximately US$100 - US$120). Recipients are encouraged to forward the mail, and the explanatory text is written in both English and Korean script. The Turkistan Islamic Party claimed that \"Muslim children in Turkistan\" were eaten by the Chinese, showing the faked pictures by Zhu Yu and photos of fake fetuses from an art exhibit.\n\nZhu Yu has been involved in many group exhibitions including Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies & Delusion in Beijing (January 1999), and The Third Guangzhou Triennial in Guangzhou (September 2008), which involved 181 artists from 40 countries.\nMost notable is his work at the Fuck Off Exhibit curated by Ai Weiwei and Feng Boyi in Shanghai, 2000. This controversial exhibit hosted 48 contemporary avant-garde artists. This is where his most controversial piece of performance art “Eating People” appeared. Among his other solo exhibitions are Plaything (Long March Space, Beijing 2010) and Leftover (Xin Beijing Art Gallery, Beijing, 2007).\n\nThe Foundation of All Epistemology: This work appeared in the 1998 group exhibition \"It’s All Right\" in Shanghai. For this piece, Zhu Yu cut and boiled five human brains which were purchased from a local hospital. He placed them in neatly labeled jars that he then signed with his own name. Zhu put these jars of brains up for sale in a market that sponsored the exhibit. He ended up selling 15 bottles each for the price of 98 yuans.\n\nEating People: In his performance art piece Eating People, Zhu photographs himself cooking and eating a human fetus that he divided into five parts. Zhu says that “I herewith announce my intention and my aim to eat people as a protest against mankind’s moral idea that he/she cannot eat people.” In further response to Zhu’s bold performance, The Ministry of Culture cited a menace to social order and the spiritual health of the Chinese people, and banned exhibitions involving culture, animal abuse, corpses, and overt violence and sexuality. However, this piece did not even appear at the exhibit; The night before the exhibition, Ai Weiwei collaborated with Zhu and the photographs were removed from the gallery. This piece was thought particularly controversial, and organizers did not want to risk government censorship for the rest of the exhibit. The response to this work stemmed from its appearance on the internet shortly after. \"Eating People\" appeared in Malaysia's \"Perdan Weekly\" without caption and generated the question of whether eating babies was accepted in Asia on various myth-debunking websites.\n\nPocket Theology: Appearing in the 1999 group exhibition \"Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies & Delusion\" in Beijing, curated by Wu Meichun and Qiu Zhije. A long coiling rope was gripped by a severed, decomposing arm which was suspended by a meat hook. This display was held in a small room in the basement that was being rented by a group of Chinese artists who organize the exhibition. Viewers were forced to walk over the rope which filled the entire space.\n\nSkin Graft: This performance art installation appeared in the 2000 exhibition \"Infatuation with Injury\" organized by Li Xianting. In the exhibit, Zhu uses his own flesh as a canvas. Photos were shown of trunk of a quartered pig lying on a hospital bed. Zhu grafted a piece of his own skin onto a section of damaged skin from the pig. Two photos of this process appeared in the exhibit; one that showed the surgical process, and another which featured the artist sewing his own skin onto the pig carcass. Zhu stood by the exhibit and lifted his shirt to show the scar which stood as evidence of the procedure.\n\nLeftover: This series was exhibited by the Xin Beijing Art Gallery at the China International Gallery Exposition. Zhu photographed plates that held bits of leftover food, and then painted those images on canvas with oil. Eight paintings appeared at the Xin Beijing Art Gallery.\n\nZhu Yu’s most recent works follow his ideas with the Leftover exhibit, in which he paints highly detailed portraits of mundane objects. His series “Stain,” features a bird’s-eye view of teacups that contain the dregs of tea leaves. The next series, “Pebble,” appeared at Zhu’s solo exhibition \"Play Thing\", at the Long March Space in Beijing, 2010. This is another series of highly detailed, realistic paintings that show individual pebbles, each featuring a slightly different hue or shape. This work implies that all life can be reduced to a pebble, a simple object from which much meaning can be derived.\n\n\"Long March Space- Beijing@Sh Contemporary 2011\": September 2011, Shanghai Exhibition Center, Shanghai\n\n\"“Top Events” 3rd Session- Poster Exhibition\": September–October 2011, TOP Contemporary Art Center, Shanghai\n\n\"Long March Space@Art Beijing 2011 Contemporary Art Fair\": April–May 2011, National Agriculture Exhibition Center, Beijing\n\n\"Long March Space@ShContemporary 2010 Shanghai Art Fait International\": September 2010, Shanghai Exhibition Center, Shanghai\n\n\"Discoveries\": Re-Value@ShContemporary 2010 Shanghai Art Fair International: September 2010, Shanghai Exhibition Center, Shanghai\n\n\"Great Performance\": August- October 2010, Pace Beijing, Beijing\n\n\"Play Thing\"(Solo): April–May 2010, Long March Project, Beijing\n\n\"Jungle\": A Close-up Focus on Chinese Contemporary Art Trends: March–May 2010, Platform Chinga Contemporary Art Institute Space A, Beijing\n\n\"Contemporary Art Exhibition in Songjiang\": September 2009, Shanghai Songjiang Creative Studio, Shanghai\n\n\"Blackboard\": May–June 2009, ShanghART Gallery, Shanghai\n\n\"Xin Beijing Art Gallery@ShContemporary 08\": September 2008, Shanghai Exhibition Center\n\n\"“Insomnia” Photographs Exhibition\": September 2008, BizArt Center, Shanghai\n\n\"The Third Guanzhou Triennial\": September–November 2008, Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou\n\n\"Portraying Food\": June–July 2008, Walsh Gallery, Chicago\n\n\"Illegal Construction II\": March–May 2008, Long March Project, Beijing\n\n\"Retrospective Exhibition I\": January 2008, Xin Beijing Art Gallery, Beijing\n\n\"Exit/Entrance\": September–October 2007, Xin Beijing Art Gallery, Beijing\n\n\"Xin Beijing Art Gallery@ShContemporary 07\": September 2007, Shanghai Exhibition Center, Shanghai\n\n\"Leftover\" (Solo): August 2007, Xin Beijing Art Gallery, Beijing\n\n\"NONO\": April–June 2007, Long March Project, Beijing\n\n\"It’s All Right\": December 2006, BizArt Center, Shanghai\n\n\"One Project Composed of 100 Projects\" (Solo): May 2006, BizArt Center, Shanghai\n\n\"Conspire\": November–January 2005/2006, TS1 Gallery, Beijing\n\n\"Internal Injuries Part 1\": July–September 2005, Primo Marella Gallery, Beijing\n\n\"Dial 62721232\": 2004, BizArt Center, Beijing\n\n\"Nasty\": October 2003, BizArt Center, Beijing\n\n\"Mushroom, Or Utopia\": November–December 2002, The Bund Museum, Shanghai\n\n\"Fan Mingzhen and Fan Mingzhen\": November 2002, BizArt Center, Beijing\n\n\"Fuck Off\": November 2000, Shanghai Eastlink Gallery, Shanghai\n\n\"It’s All Right\": January 1998-December 2006, BizArt Center, Beijing\n\n\n"}
