{"id": "1438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1438", "title": "Absalom", "text": "Absalom\n\nAbsalom (, \"Avshalom\", \"father of peace\"), according to the Hebrew Bible, was the third son of David, King of Israel with Maacah, daughter of Talmai, King of Geshur.\n\nAbsalom, David's third son, by Maacah, was born in Hebron. He moved at an early age along with the transfer of the capital to Jerusalem, where he spent most of his life. He was a great favorite of his father, and of the people. His charming manners, personal beauty, insinuating ways, love of pomp, and royal pretensions, captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning. He lived in great style, drove in a magnificent chariot, and had fifty men run before him.\n\nLittle is known of Absalom's family life, but the biblical narrative states that he had three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar . From the language of , \"I have no son to keep my name in remembrance\", it is inferred that his sons died at an early age.\n\nAbsalom's sister, who was also called Tamar, was raped by Amnon, who was their half-brother. Amnon was also David's eldest son. After the rape, Absalom waited two years, and then avenged Tamar by sending his servants to murder a drunken Amnon at a feast, to which Absalom had invited all the king's sons ().\n\nAfter this murder Absalom fled to Talmai, who was the king of Geshur and Absalom's maternal grandfather (see also or ). It was not until three years later that Absalom was fully reinstated in his father's favour and finally returned to Jerusalem (see Joab).\n\nWhile at Jerusalem, Absalom built support for himself by speaking to those who came to King David for justice, saying, “See, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you\", perhaps reflecting flaws in the judicial system of the United Monarchy. \"If only I were the judge of the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice.\" He made gestures of flattery by kissing those who bowed before him instead of accepting supplication. He \"stole the hearts of the people of Israel\".\n\nAfter four years he declared himself king, raised a revolt at Hebron, the former capital, and slept with his father's concubines. All Israel and Judah flocked to him, and David, attended only by the Cherethites and Pelethites and his former bodyguard, which had followed him from Gath, found it expedient to flee. The priests Zadok and Abiathar remained in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as David's spies. Absalom reached the capital and consulted with the renowned Ahithophel (sometimes spelled Achitophel).\n\nDavid took refuge from Absalom's forces beyond the Jordan River. However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, Hushai, to infiltrate Absalom's court and subvert it. Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahithophel's advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack. This gave David critical time to prepare his own troops for the battle.\n\nA fateful battle was fought in the Wood of Ephraim (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom's army was completely routed. Absalom's head was caught in the boughs of an oak tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it. He was discovered there still alive by one of David's men, who reported this to Joab, the king's commander. Joab, accustomed to avenging himself, took this opportunity to even the score with Absalom. Absalom had once set Joab's field on fire and then made Amasa Captain of the Host instead of Joab. Killing Absalom was against David's explicit command, \"Beware that none touch the young man Absalom\". Joab killed Absalom with three darts through the heart.\n\nWhen David heard that Absalom was killed, although not how he was killed, he greatly sorrowed.\nDavid withdrew to the city (Mahanaim) in mourning, until Joab roused him from \"the extravagance of his grief\" and called on him to fulfil his duty to his people.\n\nAbsalom had erected a monument near Jerusalem to perpetuate his name:\n\nNow Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.\n\nAn ancient monument in the Kidron Valley near the Old City of Jerusalem, known as the Tomb of Absalom or Absalom's Pillar and traditionally identified as the monument of the biblical narrative, is now dated by modern archeologists to the first century AD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4040023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4040023", "title": "Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid", "text": "Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid\n\nAbu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Nu'man al-'Ukbari al-Baghdadi, known as al-Shaykh al-Mufid (Persian: شیخ مفید) and Ibn al-Mu'allim (c.9481022 CE), was a prominent Twelver Shia theologian. His father was a teacher (\"mu'allim\"), hence the name Ibn al-Mu'allim. The title \"al-Mufid\" was given to him either by Muhammad al-Mahdi, the twelfth Shia Imam, or by al-Rummani, a Sunni scholar, after a conversation with him. The leader of the Shia community, he was a \"Mutikallim\", theologian, and Shia jurist.\n\nHe was taught by Al-Shaykh al-Saduq, Ibn Qulawayh, Abu Abdallah al-Basri and al-Rummani, and Sharif al-Murtaza and Shaykh Tusi were among his students. Only 10 of his 200 works have survived, among which are \"Amali\", \"Al-Irshad\", \"Al-Muqni'ah\", and \"Tashih al-Itiqadat\".\n\nAl-Mufid was born in 'Ukbara, a small town to the north of Baghdad, on 11th Dhul Qa'dah in 336 Hijra. According to Shaykh Tusi, however, he was born in 338AH, and later migrated with his father to Baghdad, where the Shia Buwayhids were ruling. He studied with Ibn Babawayh.\n\nSharif al-Murtaza and Shaykh Tusi were among his students. His career coincided with that of the Mu'tazili theologian and leader of the Bahshamiyya school, 'Abd al-Jabbar. Al-Mufid was often attacked, and his library and school were destroyed.\n\nHe was also called Ibn Muallim, meaning \"son of the teacher\"; Muallim was his father. Among his teachers were the Shia theologian Abu Ali al-Iskafi, Abu Abdallah al-Marzubani, Abu Abdallah al-Basri, Abu al-Hassan, and Ali ibn Isa al-Rummani.\n\nCommonly known as the leader of the Shia, Al-Mufid is regarded as the most famous scholar of the Buyid period and an eminent jurist, mainly due to his contributions in the field of kalam. According to Ibn al-Nadim, who knew al-Mufid personally, he was the head of the Shia \"Mutekallimun\" in the field of kalam, and al-Tawhidi, who was also personally familiar with al-Mufid, described him as \"eloquent and skillful at dialectic (\"jadal\")\". His skill in polemical debate was such that he was said to be capable of convincing his opponents \"that a wooden column was actually gold\". He was taught the Islamic science of hadith by Al-Shaykh al-Saduq.\n\nIt is said that al-Mufid earned his name \"al-Mufid\" as a result of a dispute about the relative merits of two events, the Ghadir Khumm and the Cave. Al-Mufid participated in a lecture given by Isa al-Rummani, where in a response to a question al-Rummani claimed that Ghadir Khum was based merely on \"riwayah\" (transmitted tradition), while the story of the Cave was based on \"diraya\" (knowledge). After the lecture, al-Mufid visited al-Rummani and asked him about Talha and Zubayr, who had rebelled against Ali, \"a legitimate Imam\". Al-Rummani responded that they had repented, and al-Mufid claimed that their repenting was merely based on \"riwaya\". Al-Rummani then sent al-Mufid to al-Basri, with a note nicknaming the bearer \"al-Mufid\" (\"the Instructor\"). However, according to Ibn Shahr Ashub, in his \"Ma'alimul Ulamaa\", the name was given to him by Muhammad al-Mahdi, the twelfth Shia Imam.\n\nTaught by Abdallah al-Basri, the Mutazili theologian and hanafi jurist, al-Mufid adopted many theological opinions. Macdermott believes that al-Mufid's theology is closer to the old Baghdad school of Mutazilism than to Abdul Jabbar's late Basran system. His methodology is closer to that of the Baghdad school, and he seems to have followed the Baghdad school and Mutazilism in his views concerning such questions as God's unity and justice. However, al-Mufid differs from Mutazilism on the problem of Imamate and the position of grave sin in this life. Al-Mufid tried to defend the role of reasonhe described it as Al-Nazarand also disputed for the truth and put away faults with the help of argument and proofs. Also, al-Mufid believed that the task of a theologian was according to reason and argument. His views were adopted by his pupils, 'Abd al-Jabbar and Sharif al-Murtaza.\n\nAl-Mufid defined God's unity in this way: According to al-Mufid, all believers in God's unity, save for \"some eccentric anthropomorphists\", agree with this. Like Mutazilis, al-Mufid rejected \"the simple realism of the Ash'arite theory of attribution\". However, al-Mufid and 'Abd al-Jabbar give different explanations of what an attribute is, and whether it is in an object or in the mind.\n\nAccording to al-Mufid, there is an absolute necessity for prophets, since in order to know God and moral principles man needs revelation, and he noted that \"every apostle (\"rasul\") is a prophet but every prophet (\"nabi\") is not an apostle\". Although he took care to make a distinction between an apostle and a prophet as the Quran does, he did not believe that there was a difference in their functions, which enabled him to put the Imams on the level of the prophets and the apostles except in terms of their names.\n\nAl-Mufid defined the \"Imamiya\" as those who believe in the necessity of Imamah, Ismah and personal \"nass\", i.e., personal designation. He tended to the belief that the Imams are superior to all the prophets and apostles, with the exception of Muhammad. According to al-Mufid, Imams can \"take the place of the prophets in enforcing judgments, seeing to the execution of the legal penalties, safeguarding the Law, and educating mankind\", a definition which makes an Imam not only \"the head of the community in administrative, judicial, and military matters\", but an \"authoritative teacher of mankind\". This attitude regarding Shia Imam is the basis of other teaching in Mufid theology such as Imam’s immunity from sin and error, the necessity of having an imam in all the times and the way the Imam should be designated.\n\nOn a number of occasions al-Mufid was a critical of his teacher, Al-Shaykh al-Saduq, and his \"Tashih al-Itiqadat\" was a correction of al-Saduq's \"Risalat al-Itaqadat\". Not limiting himself to theological matters, al-Mufid rejected al-Saduq's resort to \"akhbar al-ahad\" (single tradition), particularly when a legal statement is to be issued. However, he did not object to al-Saduq's views concerning the extent of the Quran; he only criticized his views on the nature of the Quran. Unlike al-Saduq, al-Mufid accepted \"religious and speculative theology\". While al-Saduq allowed controversy \"only in the form of quoting and explaining the words of God, the Prophet, and the Imams\", reporting a tradition from Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam of Shia, al-Mufid believed that there were two kinds of disputationnamely, \"true\" and \"vain\".\n\nShaykh al-Mufid is said to have written 200 works, of which only a few more than ten have survived. Some of his works are as follows:\n\n\nAl-Mufid received two Tawqees by Muhammad al-Mahdi during major occultation.\n\nAl-Mufid died on the third day of Ramadan in 413AH. According to the Shia writer Shaykh Tusi, \"The day of his death drew the largest crowd ever seen in any funeral, and both friends and foes wept uncontrollably\". He remained buried in his own house for two years, after which his body was moved to Al Kadhimiya Mosque and buried next to his teacher, Ibn Qulawayh al-Qummi. His grave is near the feet of two of the Shia Imams, Musa al-Kadhim and his grandson Muhammad al-Jawad.\n\nThe ninth day of Azar in Iran's official calendar is the commemoration day of Shaykh al-Mufid.\nAn image of Mofid has been shown as imaginary in a paint.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2543", "title": "Alexander Kerensky", "text": "Alexander Kerensky\n\nAlexander Fyodorovich Kerensky (, ; Russian: Александръ Ѳедоровичъ Керенскій; 4 May 1881 – 11 June 1970) was a Russian lawyer and revolutionist who was a key political figure in the Russian Revolution of 1917. After the February Revolution of 1917, he joined the newly formed Russian Provisional Government, first as Minister of Justice, then as Minister of War, and after July as the government's second Minister-Chairman. A leader of the moderate-socialist Trudoviks faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, he was also vice-chairman of the powerful Petrograd Soviet. On 7 November, his government was overthrown by the Lenin-led Bolsheviks in the October Revolution. He spent the remainder of his life in exile, in Paris and New York City, and worked for the Hoover Institution.\n\nAlexander Kerensky was born in Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk) on the Volga River on 4 May 1881 and was the eldest son in the family. His father, Fyodor Mikhailovich Kerensky, was a teacher and director of the local gymnasium and was later promoted to Inspector of public schools. His maternal grandfather was head of the Topographical Bureau of the Kazan Military District. His mother, Nadezhda Aleksandrovna (née Adler), (the first-name Nadezhda meaning \"Hope\"; her patronymic last or \"maiden\" name was Kalmykova), was the daughter of a former serf who had had to purchase his freedom before serfdom was abolished in 1861. He subsequently embarked upon a mercantile career, in which he prospered, allowing him to move his business to Moscow, where he continued his success, becoming a wealthy Moscow merchant.\n\nKerensky's father was the teacher of Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin), and members of the Kerensky and Ulyanov families were friends. In 1889, when Kerensky was eight, the family moved to Tashkent, where his father had been appointed the main inspector of public schools (superintendent). Alexander graduated with honours in 1899. The same year he entered St. Petersburg University, where he studied history and philology. The next year he switched to law. He earned his law degree in 1904 and married Olga Lvovna Baranovskaya, the daughter of a Russian general, the same year. Kerensky joined the Narodnik movement and worked as a legal counsel to victims of the Revolution of 1905. At the end of 1904, he was jailed on suspicion of belonging to a militant group. Afterwards he gained a reputation for his work as a defence lawyer in a number of political trials of revolutionaries.\n\nIn 1912, Kerensky became widely known when he visited the goldfields at the Lena River and published material about the Lena Minefields incident. In the same year, Kerensky was elected to the Fourth Duma as a member of the Trudoviks, a moderate, non-Marxist labour party founded by Alexis Aladin that was associated with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and joined a Freemason society uniting the anti-monarchy forces that strived for the democratic renewal of Russia. In fact, the Socialist Revolutionary Party bought Kerensky a house, as he otherwise wouldn't be elective for the Duma, according to the Russian property-laws. He then soon became a significant Duma member of the \"Progressive Block\", which included several Socialist Parties, Mensheviks, and Liberals - but not the Bolsheviks. He was a brilliant orator and skilled parliamentary leader of the socialist opposition to the government of Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nOn May 28, 1914, Kerensky appealed to Rodzianko with a request from the Council of elders to inform the Tsar that to succeed in war he must:\n1) change his domestic policy,\n2) proclaim a General Amnesty for political prisoners,\n3) restore the Constitution of Finland,\n4) declare the autonomy of Poland,\n5) provide national minorities autonomy in the field of culture,\n6) abolish restrictions against Jews,\n7) end religious intolerance,\n8) stop the harassment of legal trade union organizations.\n\nKerensky was an active member of the irregular Freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia's Peoples, which derived from the Grand Orient of France. Kerensky was Secretary General of the Grand Orient of Russia's Peoples and stood down following his ascent to government in July 1917. He was succeeded by Menshevik, Alexander Halpern.\n\nIn response to bitter resentments held against the imperial favourite Grigori Rasputin in the midst of Russia's failing effort in World War I, Kerensky, at the opening of the Duma on 2 November 1916, called the imperial ministers \"hired assassins\" and \"cowards\", and alleged that they were \"guided by the contemptible Grishka Rasputin!\" Grand Duke Nikolai Mikhailovich, Prince Lvov, and general Mikhail Alekseyev attempted to persuade the emperor Nicholas II to send away the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, Rasputin's steadfast patron, either to the Livadia Palace in Yalta or to England. Mikhail Rodzianko, Zinaida Yusupova (the mother of Felix Yusupov), Alexandra's sister Elisabeth, Grand Duchess Victoria and the empress's mother-in-law Maria Feodorovna also tried to influence and pressure the imperial couple to remove Rasputin from his position of influence within the imperial household, but without success. According to Kerensky, Rasputin had terrorised the empress by threatening to return to his native village.\n\nMonarchists murdered Rasputin in December 1916, burying him near the imperial residence in Tsarskoye Selo. Shortly after the February Revolution of 1917, Kerensky ordered soldiers to re-bury the corpse at an unmarked spot in the countryside. However, the truck broke down or was forced to stop because of the snow on Lesnoe Road outside of St. Petersburg. It is likely the corpse was incinerated (between 3 and 7 in the morning) in the cauldrons of the nearby boiler shop of the Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University, including the coffin, without leaving a single trace.\n\nWhen the February Revolution broke out in 1917, Kerensky together with Pavel Milyukov was one of its most prominent leaders. As one of the Duma's most well-known spacers from the monarchy and as a lawyer and defender of many revolutionaries, Kerensky became a member of the Provisional Committee of the State Duma and was elected vice-chairman of the newly formed Petrograd Soviet. These two instances, the Duma and the Petrograd Soviet, or their respective executive committees rather, soon became each other's antagonists on most matters except regarding the end of the Tsar's autocracy.\n\nThe Petrograd Soviet counted 3000-4000 members, and as their meetings drowned in a blur of everlasting orations, soon the Executive committee of Petrograd Soviet or Ispolkom was formed. Ispolkom was a self-appointed committee, with three members from all parties represented in the Soviet. Kerensky was one of them, representing the Social Revolutionary party.\n\nOn 1.March 1917, without any consultation with the government, Ispolkom declared the infamous Order No. 1, intended for the 160.000 men strong Petrograd garrison only, but which became interpreted to be valid also at the front. The order stipulated that all military units should form committees like the Petrograd Soviet. This led to confusion and \"striping of officers\", further \"Order number 3\" stipulated that the military, in every political perspective, was subordinated to Ispolkom. The ideas came from a group of Socialists and aimed to make the officers without power aside from the war. The socialist intellectuals believed the officers to be the most likely counterrevolutionary elements. Kerensky's role in these orders are unclear, but he participated in the decisions. But just like he before the revolution had defended many who disliked the Tsar, he now saved the lives of many of the Tsar's civil servants about to be lynched by mobs\n\nAlso, the Duma formed an executive committee which eventually became the so-called Russian Provisional Government. As there was little trust between Ispolkom and this Government, and as Kerensky was about to accept becoming Attorney General in the Provisional Government, he held a most passionate speech, not to the Ispolkom, but to the entire Petrograd Soviet. He then swore, as Minister never to fail the democratic values, and ended his speech with the words \"I cannot live without the people. In the moment you begin to doubt me, then kill me\". The huge majority (workers and soldiers) gave him great applause, and Kerensky now became the first and \"the only one\" that participated in both the Provisional Government and the Ispolkom. As a link between Ispolkom and the Provisional Government, the quite ambitious Kerensky could benefit from this position.\nAfter the first government crisis over Pavel Milyukov's secret note re-committing Russia to its original war aims on 2–4 May, Kerensky became the Minister of War and the dominant figure in the newly formed socialist-liberal coalition government. On 10 May (Julian calendar), Kerensky started for the front and visited one division after another, urging the men to do their duty. His speeches were impressive and convincing for the moment, but had little lasting effect. Under Allied pressure to continue the war, he launched what became known as the Kerensky Offensive against the Austro-Hungarian/German South Army on 17 June (Julian Calendar). At first successful, the offensive was soon stopped and then thrown back by a strong counter-attack. The Russian army suffered heavy losses, and it was clear from the many incidents of desertion, sabotage, and mutiny that the army was no longer willing to attack.\n\nKerensky was heavily criticised by the military for his liberal policies, which included stripping officers of their mandates and handing over control to revolutionary inclined \"soldier committees\" instead; the abolition of the death penalty; and allowing revolutionary agitators to be present at the front. Many officers jokingly referred to commander-in-chief Kerensky as \"persuader-in-chief.\"\n\nOn 2 July 1917, the first coalition collapsed over the question of Ukraine's autonomy. Following the July Days unrest in Petrograd and suppression of the Bolsheviks, Kerensky succeeded Prince Lvov as Russia's Prime Minister. Following the Kornilov Affair, an attempted military coup d'état at the end of August, and the resignation of the other ministers, he appointed himself Supreme Commander-in-Chief as well.\n\nKerensky's next move, on 15 September, was to proclaim Russia a republic, which was contrary to the non-socialists' understanding that the Provisional Government should hold power only until a Constituent Assembly should meet to decide Russia's form of government, but which was in line with the long proclaimed aim of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. He formed a five-member Directory, which consisted of himself, minister of foreign affairs Mikhail Tereshchenko, minister of war General Verkhovsky, minister of the navy Admiral Dmitry Verderevsky and minister of post and telegraph Nikitin. He retained his post in the final coalition government in October 1917 until it was overthrown by the Bolsheviks.\nKerensky's major challenge was that Russia was exhausted after three years of its participation in World War I, while the provisional government offered little motivation for a victory outside of continuing Russia's obligations towards its allies. Russia's continued involvement in the war was not popular among the lower and middle classes, and especially not popular among the soldiers. They had all believed that Russia would stop fighting when the Provisional Government took power, and now they felt deceived. Furthermore, Vladimir Lenin and his Bolshevik party were promising \"peace, land, and bread\" under a communist system. The army was disintegrating owing to a lack of discipline, leading to desertion in large numbers. By autumn 1917, an estimated two million men had unofficially left the army.\n\nKerensky and the other political leaders continued Russia's involvement in World War I, thinking nothing but a glorious victory was the only road forward. Fearing that the economy, already under huge stress from the war effort, might become increasingly unstable if vital supplies from France and the United Kingdom were cut off. The dilemma of whether to withdraw was a great one, and Kerensky's inconsistent and impractical policies further destabilised the army and the country at large.\n\nFurthermore, Kerensky adopted a policy that isolated the right-wing conservatives, both democratic and monarchist-oriented. His philosophy of \"no enemies to the left\" greatly empowered the Bolsheviks and gave them a free hand, allowing them to take over the military arm or \"voyenka\" of the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets. His arrest of Lavr Kornilov and other officers left him without strong allies against the Bolsheviks, who ended up being Kerensky's strongest and most determined adversaries, as opposed to the right wing, which evolved into the White movement.\n\nDuring the Kornilov Affair, Kerensky had distributed arms to the Petrograd workers, and by November most of these armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks. On 1917, the Bolsheviks launched the second Russian revolution of the year. Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city. Only one small force, a subdivision of the 2nd company of the First Petrograd Women's Battalion, also known as The Women's Death Battalion, was willing to fight for the government against the Bolsheviks, but this force was overwhelmed by the numerically superior pro-Bolshevik forces, defeated, and captured. The Bolsheviks took less than 20 hours to seize the government.\n\nKerensky escaped the Bolsheviks and fled to Pskov, where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to re-take the city. His troops managed to capture Tsarskoe Selo but were beaten the next day at Pulkovo. Kerensky narrowly escaped, and he spent the next few weeks in hiding before fleeing the country, eventually arriving in France. During the Russian Civil War, he supported neither side, as he opposed both the Bolshevik regime and the White Movement.\n\nKerensky was married to Olga Lvovna Baranovskaya and they had two sons, Oleg and Gleb, whom both went on to become engineers. Kerensky's grandson (also named Oleg) played his grandfather's role in the 1981 film \"Reds\". Kerensky and Olga were divorced in 1939 and soon after he settled in Paris, and while visiting the United States he met and married 1939 the Australian former journalist Lydia Ellen \"Nell\" Tritton (1899–1946). The marriage took place in Martins Creek, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen Germany invaded France in 1940, they emigrated to the United States. After the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Kerensky offered his support to Joseph Stalin. When his wife Nell became terminally ill in 1945, Kerensky travelled with her to Brisbane, Australia, and lived there with her family. She suffered a stroke in February 1946, and he remained there until her death on 10 April 1946. Kerensky returned to the United States, where he spent the rest of his life.\n\nKerensky eventually settled in New York City living on the Upper East Side on 91st Street near Central Park but spent much of his time at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in California, where he both used and contributed to the Institution's huge archive on Russian history, and where he taught graduate courses. He wrote and broadcast extensively on Russian politics and history.\nKerensky died of arteriosclerotic heart disease at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City in 1970, one of the last surviving major participants in the turbulent events of 1917. The local Russian Orthodox Churches in New York City refused to grant Kerensky burial, because of his association with Freemasonry and because they saw him as largely responsible for the Bolsheviks seizing power. A Serbian Orthodox Church also refused burial. Kerensky's body was flown to London, where he was buried at the non-denominational Putney Vale Cemetery.\n\n\nKerensky was portrayed in the 1971 film Nicholas and Alexandra by John McEnery.\n\n\n\n"}

Barayev was a martial arts fan in his youth, and became a police officer in 1990 at the age of just 16. In 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent declaration of independence Chechnya from the Russian Federation, he became a personal bodyguard to his uncle, Vakha Arsanov, the future vice president. Barayev also protected Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, with whom he formed a close personal relationship, and Sultan Geliskhanov, director of Chechnya's State Security Department. In 1994 the First Chechen War began, where Barayev fought on the Chechen separatist side, and it was during this time he committed his first act of kidnapping when he and his men abducted for ransom a group of 29 Russian engineers from a power plant near the Chechen capital, Grozny.\n\nThe war ended in 1996, with a Chechen separatist victory establishing a \"de facto\" independent Chechnya. Barayev formed the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, where he and his associates became infamous for their alleged part in a wave of lawlessness which swept the devastated country. Crimes include including brutal killings and kidnappings as well as suspected involvement in two failed attempts to assassinate the Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov, and the successful assassinations of the Chechen interior minister Nasrudi Bazhiyev, and Shadid Bargishev, head of the newly formed anti-abduction service. The group, based around the town of Urus-Martan, were linked to a series of high-profile crimes including the notorious murder of six foreign Red Cross employees shot dead in the hospital of Novye Atagi in September 1996, as well as the kidnappings of Yelena Masyuk, a Russian NTV journalist and personal friend of President Maskhadov, and Valenti Vlasov, Russian president Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya. Other high-profile hostages allegedly kidnapped by Barayev included the ORT journalists Roman Pereveztsyev and Vladislav Tibelius, an Italian journalist Mauro Galligani, British children-aid workers Camilla Carr and Jon James (during a failed operation to rescue them, the Chechen anti-kidnap unit commandos engaged in a deadly clash with \"unknown terrorists\", unofficially Salman Raduyev's men; they were eventually ransomed by Boris Berezovsky) and others.\n\nIn 1997, Maskhadov signed a decree putting Barayev and his Special Purpose Islamic Regiment under the command of the Chechen interior ministry. Barayev, who also held the post of deputy commander of the National Guards, however refused to obey the order. When six of his men were detained in Ingushetia, Barayev attacked an Ingush police post and took hostages; one of them was killed and the rest were prisoner-swapped. Two more of his men were captured in Chechnya and made to confess to kidnappings on the state TV. His militia and some Islamist allies from Shariah Security forces fought with the Chechen government forces in a large-scale gun battle in the city of Gudermes in the summer of 1998. Between 50 and around 80 people were killed in the mutiny. The SPIR was not disarmed, but Barayev was stripped of his rank of Brigade General and declared as the \"enemy of Ichkeria and the Chechen people\". In December 1998, Barayev proclaimed the Supreme Council of Islamic Jamaats, dug trenches around Urus-Martan and threatened to attack targets across and outside of Chechnya if Maskhadov tried to fight them.\n\nA commonly accusation against Barayev regarded the late 1998 abduction and beheading of four foreign mobile phone engineers. It was claimed that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) outbid the employers of kidnapped British engineers to get them decapitated by Barayev and his gang rather than be released; supposedly, the video and photographic materials of their executions fed the FSB anti-western propaganda efforts at beginning of Second Chechen War. \n\nA former Russian hostage Abdurakhman Adukhov told the BBC that Barayev told him it was actually Osama bin Laden who paid him $30m for the atrocity, outbidding the ransom offer of $10m. Barayev himself denied that his group kidnapped and killed the foreigners.\n\nIn August 1999, Russia launched the Second Chechen War in response to the Invasion of Dagestan by the Islamic International Brigade. Dagestan borders Chechnya to the east, and as part of the operation Russian troops entered Chechnya on 1 October to restore federal control over the country, effectively ending its \"de facto\" independence. In March 2000, during the early phase of the war, Barayev reportedly betrayed the Chechen field commander Ruslan Gelayev to the Russian military forces, resulting in the massacre of Gelayev's forces in the Battle of Komsomolskoye. According to another version, Barayev and his men merely bribed their way out of Komsomolskoye while leaving Gelayev and his people to their fate. The incident led to the declaration of revenge on the part of Gelayev, whose fighters then blew up several houses belonging to Barayev in his home village of Alkhan-Kala near Grozny, killed a number of his men, and even attempted to assassinate Barayev in Ingushetia. According to federal authorities, more than 40 Chechens died as a result of these clashes.\n\nChechen surgeon Khassan Baiev, who amputated a portion of the leg of Shamil Basayev after his injury on a minefield, also had operated on Salman Raduyev and Arbi Barayev himself, however Barayev promised to kill him because he would also help wounded Russian soldiers. Baiev described Barayev as \"a born killer, and his men were desperados with blood vendettas proclaimed against them for murder. They joined Barayev for protection against the avengers in an endless cycle of violence. ... He owned a stable of expensive foreign cars, had several wives, and moved around with an escort of twenty to thirty guards. Everyone assumed that he was in the pay of Russian intelligence. Relatives of Arbi Barayev publicly denounced him for his crimes, saying that the family announced in the courtyard of the mosque that if anyone killed him, they would relinquish all claims. There would be no blood revenge.\" Facing death threats from Barayev as well as from the federal side, Baiev was eventually forced to seek political asylum in the United States. \n\nFollowing the Russian occupation of most of Chechnya, Barayev freely lived in Alkhan-Kala and frequently passed through Russian Army checkpoints without any problems, using identity papers of an FSB officer, and was also not included in the lists of people wanted \"for participation in illegal armed groups\". Once arrested, Barayev was said to be instantly released by the demand of Beslan Gantamirov, then the leading figure in the pro-Moscow government. In May 2000, the Russian military intelligence GRU officer leaked papers about Barayev's affiliation with FSB to a Chechen journalist. In April 2001, Barayev's men allegedly ambushed and killed Viktor Popkov, a Russian dissident working in Chechnya as an aid worker and human rights activist since 1995, in the close vicinity of a military roadblock. According to the United States Department of State, Barayev sent a group of his fighters to train in Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan in the spring of the same year.\n\nOn June 22, 2001, Barayev was reported killed during a raid by the Russian military special forces on Alkhan-Kala. According to a Russian military spokesman, 17 Chechens and at least one soldier were killed in the operation. The Russian media had reported his death several previous times, but every time he re-emerged unscathed; however, this time, the Kavkaz Center announced that \"Special Islamic commander Arbi Barayev has become a martyr.\" According to another version of Barayev's death, the GRU decided to eliminate him after the suspicious death of FSB chief Vice-Admiral German Ugryumov, who allegedly provided cover for Barayev. In a well-prepared five-day operation, GRU agents recruited from Chechens in a blood feud with Barayev searched for him in Alkhan-Kala and then stormed a local FSB base where he ran for cover, killing an FSB agent in the process. Barayev was allegedly captured alive and then tortured to death. His body was given to his immediate family for a funeral (in contrast, when Maskhadov was killed in 2005, he was buried by the Russians in an unmarked secret grave), he was however barred from being buried in his home village by the local people.\n\nIn October 2002, the continuation of the SPIR carried out the Moscow theater hostage crisis, led by Barayev's 22-year-old nephew and successor Movsar and featured his widow Zura Barayeva, both of whom died in the attack. The remnants of Barayev's group were reportedly integrated into the mainstream rebel forces following the theatre seizure.\n\n\n"}

Blackwell (July 30, 1942 – January 2, 2013) was an American Chickasaw Nation diplomat and lawyer, who served as the first Ambassador of the Chickasaw Nation to the United States of America from 1995 until his death in 2013. Blackwell, who represented the Chickasaw Nation of the U.S. state of Oklahoma, was the first Ambassador of any Native American tribal government to the government of the United States.\n\nBlackwell was born at Concho Indian Hospital in El Reno, Oklahoma, on July 30, 1942. He was raised in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. His ancestry included Choctaw as well as Chickasaw. As a boy, he spent most summers with his grandparents, who were educators employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) on the North Plains and New Mexico. This experience formed his deep ties to Picuris Pueblo in New Mexico and Loneman School on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Heals became fluent in Lakota, as well as the Chickasaw and Choctaw languages. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts in education from East Central State College (present-day East Central University) in 1964, where he was named \"Student of the Year\" in 1964, served as editor of the college's newspaper, and was the founding president of the Epsilon Omega chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. After receiving his degree, he taught English at Window Rock High School in Fort Defiance, Arizona.\n\nIn 1972, Blackwell received a law degree from the University of New Mexico School of Law. He held a position as a staff attorney at the American Indian Law Center from 1972 to 1974 after graduating from law school. Blackwell then served as the Associate Director of the Special Scholarship Program in Law for American Indians from 1974 until 1977. He simultaneously became a Assistant Dean and Adjunct Professor at the University of New Mexico School of Law, his alma mater, from 1974 to 1977 as well.\n\nIn 1979, Blackwell founded a group that was later named Native Affairs and Development Group and in 1985 relocated to Washington, D. C.\n\nIn 1990, Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby appointed Blackwell as delegate to the United States. He would serve as delegate until 1995, when Governor Anoatubby would elevate him to ambassador.\n\nThe decision to send Blackwell to Washington D.C. as the Chickasaw delegate (from 1990-1995) and then ambassador (1995-2013) came after discussions between Anoatubby and Blackwell. According to Governor Anoatubby, \"We agreed that there was a need for the tribes to revive a tradition of diplomatic relations with other governments...Appointment of an official ambassador helped to reinforce the formal government-to-government relationship the Chickasaw Nation had with the federal government. Over the years, Charles did a tremendous job of helping that relationship grow and improve.\"\n\nIn 1995, Governor Anoatubby appointed Blackwell as the first Ambassador of the Chickasaw Nation to the United States. Blackwell was not only the first Native American Ambassador to the U.S., but also the first tribal ambassador from any Native American government to the United States. He took office at a 1995 ceremony held in Washington. Blackwell held the ambassadorship, which is based in Washington D.C., from 1995 until his death in office in January 2013.\n\nDuring his tenure, Blackwell became a prominent advocate for Native American education, health and economic issues. Blackwell founded the First American Business Center, headquartered in Washington D.C. which promotes Native American economic development and entrepreneurship. He also served within the Western Governor's States Drought Coordination Council from 1995 to 1997. Ambassador Blackwell contributed to the Chickasaw Times as a frequent columnist.\n\nIn 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton appointed Blackwell to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. He served on as the Council's only Native American member from 1997 until 2001.\n\nBlackwell died in office in Washington D.C. on January 2, 2013, at the age of 70. The cause of death was \"...of respiratory complications following surgery.\" Chickasaw Governor Bill Anoatubby released a statement praising Blackwell, \"Charles Blackwell embodied all the best qualities of a diplomat and statesman as the Chickasaw Nation Ambassador to the United States. He brought a tremendous level of wisdom, integrity, knowledge and passion to his duties as our emissary in Washington...As one who was fortunate enough to call Charles my friend, it is with great sadness that my condolences go out to his family and other close friends. This is a sad day for the entire Chickasaw Nation, as we have lost an irreplaceable friend and unrivaled advocate.\" An official memorial service was held at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington on January 26, 2013.\n\n"}

{"id": "58419785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58419785", "title": "Elena Nicoladis", "text": "Elena Nicoladis\n\nElena Nicoladis is a professor in science and psychology for the University of Alberta in Canada. She is interested in how children acquire language as either monolinguals or bilinguals. She continues to do her research on the acquisition of the language and the morphology. Bilinguals hear less of each language than monolinguals so her interest is more focused on them because of their disadvantage in acquiring language.\n\nElena Nicoladis is responsible for researching the use of gestures in language for those who seem to struggle with language. This includes: the elderly, a child learning their first language or someone learning their second language to become bilingual. Nicoladis and her colleagues were able to develop hypotheses around this subject and came up with some questions and answers that pertain. Their findings were that the use of gestures is found in the various groups to replace or aid in the absence and weak portions of an individual's language. Individuals use gestures called iconic or symbolic gestures which are gestures to depict the subject at hand without having to say a word. In other words they use this as their reference to what they are trying to convey to the audience. An example of an iconic gesture is when a child is flapping their hand to indicate a butterfly or when someone is moving their index finger and middle finger back and forth to represent someone walking (Nicoladis 2002). Ironically, the findings were that the people with more speaking experience, including: elders, deaf people, and bilinguals, used more iconic gestures in their speaking. Bilinguals use more iconic gestures in their native or stronger language and tend to use more conventional gestures. This was demonstrated using five second language with French as their first language and five with Swedish as their first language. (Nicoladis 2002). The main point out of this study is that gestures do help with the message that language tries to convey but the types of gestures and use is different for everyone. This does not necessarily mean that it is for assisting the absence or weakness of speech, rather that gestures are based on the higher proficiency of the language.\n\nNicoladis examines the syntactic awareness (children’s ability arrange words and phrases) of monolingual and bilingual children. She assesses their syntax through the grammatical accuracy of their sentences and by administering a vocabulary test. The study of syntactic awareness and judgment consisted of 39 French-English bilingual children and 51 English monolingual children all from Alberta, Canada. This study was intended to test two different predictions (Foursha-Stevenson, and Nicoladis). The first was that bilinguals were better aware of syntactic awareness compared to monolinguals. Nicoladis made this prediction because children have been shown to have experience assessing words and sentence arrangements from the age of two. This experience helps their language development because they have more practice with the language compared to monolinguals. Her second prediction was whether bilingual children’s judgment of what is grammatically correct could be influenced by their other language. In the article Early emergence of syntactic awareness and cross-linguistic influence in bilingual children’s judgments, Nicoladis concludes that bilinguals produced higher accuracy scores compared to monolinguals (Foursha-Stevenson, and Nicoladis). However, on the grammatical accuracy, monolinguals scored higher on vocabulary tests (Foursha-Stevenson, and Nicoladis). Bilinguals must be able to differentiate between two different languages which enhances their attention for language choice. The results also indicated that language variability leads to greater susceptibility for cross-linguistic influence. Meaning that children’s judgment of what is acceptable syntactic structure can be influenced by the other language they speak. Children tend to link the two together when trying to determine acceptable syntactic structure.\n\nIn her study of bilingualism, Nicoladis investigated the effects of whether children who speak more than one language experience what is called “cross-linguistic influence”, which is when one language spoken by a bi/multi-lingual individual affects the way they use grammar in other languages. Examples of this behavior would be different placements of object clitics in French-English bilinguals (Hulk, 1997), object dropping in Dutch-French and German-Italian bilinguals (Hulk and Muller, 2000), and verb-object compounds in French-English bilinguals (Nicoladis, 2003). The study was performed with 89 children of preschool age (3;3-5;7), consisting of French-English bilinguals, English monolinguals, and French monolinguals. It found that its original hypothesis, that cross-linguistic transfer would occur in children due to structural overlap or ambiguity, was correct by showing that French-English bilingual children will reverse post-nominal adjectives more often than monolingual children. This objective of this study was not only to demonstrate that bilingual children engage in this behavior, but to close a gap of knowledge within bilingual research. Prior to this, studies had only been performed on experimental speech of children rather than the spontaneous. This study was performed with its focus primarily on the spontaneous speech of bilingual children.\n\nNicoladis makes the claim that bilingual children are not disadvantaged but delayed in their language development since they are learning two languages simultaneously (Paradis & Genesee, 1996). Therefore, their vocabulary is much richer in one language over the other, an issue mono-linguistic speakers don't have. However, a longitudinal study of both monolingual and bilingual children would test if that assumption is warranted. Because of the diversity of child bilinguals, there are few studies that can address the possibility that young bilinguals might be delayed in language acquisition. Nicoladis also found that bilingualism doesn’t necessarily lead to delays in morphosyntactic acquisition. The main goal of this study was to test contrastively predictions of both the single‐ and dual‐route model for French‐English bilingual children's past tense production. As opposed to monolinguals, bilinguals are more likely to use perfect forms like “have seen” when they actually mean “saw” because of the influence of the periphrastic past tense in French; similarly, bilinguals are more likely to use single‐word imperfect forms in French rather than the compound past. Nicoladis et al. (2007) found no evidence of these forms of crosslinguistic transfer in their study on narrative. As a result, she infers that crosslinguistic transfer is not likely to affect the results of the study; that is, the bilingual children can be expected to be acquiring the past tense like monolinguals in their two languages.\n"}

{"id": "475322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=475322", "title": "Exorcist", "text": "Exorcist\n\nIn some religions, an exorcist is a person who is believed to be able to cast out the devil or other demons. A priest, a nun, a monk, a healer, a shaman or other specially prepared or instructed person can be an exorcist. An exorcist is a person who performs the ridding of demons or other supernatural beings who are alleged to have possessed a person, or (sometimes) a building or even an object.\n\nIn a Roman Catholic context, \"exorcist\" may refer to a cleric who has been ordained into the minor order of exorcist, or a priest who has been mandated to perform the rite of solemn exorcism.\n\nSince at least the third century, the Latin Church has formally ordained men to the minor order of exorcist. Text previously attributed to a fourth Council of Carthage (398), now identified as a collection called \"Statuta Ecclesiæ Antiqua\", prescribes in its seventh canon the rite of ordination of such an exorcist: the bishop is to give him the book containing the formulae of exorcism, saying, \"Receive, and commit to memory, and possess the power of imposing hands on energumens, whether baptized or catechumens\".\n\nThese exorcists routinely performed ceremonies over adults and infants preparing to be baptised. Authors such as Eusebius (3rd century) and Augustine (4th century) provide details of these minor exorcisms: Eusebius mentions the imposition of hands and prayer. Augustine noted that rites of exorcism by exsufflation (breathing upon the candidate) were also performed for the baptism of infants.\n\nThe office of Exorcist was not a part of the sacrament of Holy Orders but as a sacramental was instead first conferred on those who had the special charism to perform its duties and later to those studying for the priesthood. By the twentieth century, the order had become purely ceremonial. As a minor order, exorcists wore the surplice.\n\nIn 1972, the minor orders were reformed; men preparing to be ordained as Catholic priests or deacons would no longer receive the minor order of exorcist; the minor orders of lector and acolyte were retained, but redesignated as \"ministries\". It was left open to the Catholic bishops of individual countries to petition the Vatican to establish a \"ministry of exorcist\" if it seemed useful in that nation.\n\nThe rite of conferral continues in societies that use the 1962 (or earlier) form of the Roman Rite, such as the Priestly Fraternity of St Peter, Society of St. Pius X, and also among groups not in communion with the current Bishop of Rome, such as the Society of St Pius V. Some believe that attainment of the position of Acolyte in post-Council practices implies ordination to the minor orders which used to be below it, such as Exorcist and Porter, although this has not been officially defined (although Canon Law section 1009 does specifically state that the only \"orders are the episcopate, the priesthood and the diaconate\").\n\nThe Eastern Churches did not establish a minor order of exorcist, but simply recognised the calling of lay or ordained members of the faithful who had the appropriate spiritual gifts. In principle, every Christian has the power to command demons and drive them out in the name of Christ.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: \"Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has received the power and office of exorcizing\". The 1917 Code of Canon Law explicitly stated that the solemn exorcism of a person believed to be possessed may only be performed with the express authorisation of the local bishop or equivalent; 'this permission is only to be given to priests of the highest repute'. The revised 1983 Code of Canon Law similarly stated that the bishop is 'to give this permission only to a presbyter who has piety, knowledge, prudence, and integrity of life.'\n\nThe Catholic Church's Rite of Exorcism was revised in 1999. Paragraph 13 of its introduction states that a priest can be appointed by the local Bishop either for a single act of exorcism, or to the permanent position of 'exorcist'. The Rite then specifies that whenever it uses the word \"exorcist\" without qualification, it indicates a priest mandated in this way.\nAmong notable exorcists, Gabriele Amorth served as chief exorcist of the Diocese of Rome; he was the founder of the International Association of Exorcists.\n\nBeliefs and practices pertaining to the practice of exorcism are prominently connected with the ancient Dravidians in the south. Of the four Vedas (holy books of the Hindus), the Atharva Veda is said to contain the secrets related to magic and medicine. Many of the rituals described in this book are for casting out demons and evil spirits. These beliefs are particularly strong and practiced in West Bengal, Odisha and southern states like Kerala.\n\nVaishnava traditions also employ a recitation of names of Lord Narasimha and reading scriptures (notably Bhagavata Purana) aloud. According to Gita Mahatmya of Padma Purana, reading the 3rd, 7th and 8th chapter of Bhagavad Gita and mentally offering the result to departed persons helps them to get released from their ghostly situation. Kirtan, continuous playing of mantras, keeping scriptures and holy pictures of the deities (Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Shakti etc. but especially of Narasimha) in the house, burning incense offered during a puja, sprinkling water from holy rivers, and blowing conches used in \"puja\" are other effective practices.\n\nMain Puranic resource on ghost- and death-related information is Garuda Purana.\n\n\n"}

In May 2002, he assisted in his mother's own suicide (\"we gave her the drugs\") following a five-year fight with breast cancer.\n\nWhile Newsom later reflected that he did not have an easy childhood, he attended kindergarten and first grade at the French American bilingual school in San Francisco. He eventually transferred because of severe dyslexia that still affects him. His dyslexia has made it difficult for him to write, spell, read and work with numbers. He attended third through fifth grades at Notre Dame des Victoires, where he was placed in remedial reading classes. In high school, Newsom played basketball and baseball and graduated from Redwood High School in 1985. Newsom was an outfielder in baseball and his baseball skills placed him on the cover of the \"Marin Independent Journal\".\n\nTessa Newsom worked three jobs to support Gavin and his sister Hilary Newsom Callan, who is the president of the PlumpJack Group, named after the opera \"Plump Jack\" composed by family friend Gordon Getty. In an interview with \"The San Francisco Chronicle\", his sister recalled Christmas holidays when their mother told them there wouldn't be any gifts. Tessa opened their home to foster children, instilling in Newsom the importance of public service. His father's finances were strapped in part because of his tendency to give away his earnings. Newsom worked several jobs in high school to help support his family.\n\nNewsom attended Santa Clara University on a partial baseball scholarship, where he graduated in 1989 with a B.S. in political science. Newsom was a left-handed pitcher for Santa Clara, but he threw his arm out after two years and hasn't thrown a baseball since. He lived in the Alameda Apartments, which he later compared to living in a hotel. He later reflected on his education fondly, crediting the Jesuit approach of Santa Clara that he said has helped him become an independent thinker who questions orthodoxy. While in school, Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in Rome.\n\nNewsom's aunt was married to Ron Pelosi, the brother-in-law of former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOn May 14, 1991, Newsom and his investors created the company PlumpJack Associates L.P. In 1992, the group started the PlumpJack Winery with the financial help of his family friend Gordon Getty. PlumpJack was the name of an opera written by Getty, who invested in 10 of Newsom's 11 businesses. Getty told the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" that he treated Newsom like a son and invested in his first business venture because of that relationship. According to Getty, later business investments were because of \"the success of the first.\"\n\nOne of Newsom's early interactions with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Health Department requirement to install a sink at his PlumpJack wine store. The Health Department argued that wine was a food and required the store to install a $27,000 sink in the carpeted wine shop on the grounds that the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed supervisor, he told the \"San Francisco Examiner\": \"That's the kind of bureaucratic malaise I'm going to be working through.\"\n\nThe business grew to an enterprise with more than 700 employees. The PlumpJack Cafe Partners L.P. opened the PlumpJack Café, also on Fillmore Street, in 1993. Between 1993 and 2000, Newsom and his investors opened several other businesses that included the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn with a PlumpJack Café (1994), a winery in Napa Valley (1995), the Balboa Café Bar and Grill (1995), the PlumpJack Development Fund L.P. (1996), the MatrixFillmore Bar (1998), PlumpJack Wines shop Noe Valley branch (1999), PlumpJackSport retail clothing (2000), and a second Balboa Café at Squaw Valley (2000). Newsom's investments included five restaurants and two retail clothing stores. Newsom's annual income was greater than $429,000 from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, his business holdings were valued at more than $6.9 million. Newsom gave a monthly $50 gift certificate to PlumpJack employees whose business ideas failed, because in his view, \"There can be no success without failure.\"\n\nNewsom sold his share of his San Francisco businesses when he became mayor in 2004. He maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco that included the PlumpJack Winery in Oakville, California, new PlumpJack-owned Cade Winery in Angwin, California, and the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn. He is currently the president in absentia of Airelle Wines Inc., which is connected to the PlumpJack Winery in Napa County. Newsom earned between $141,000 and $251,000 in 2007 from his business interests. In February 2006, he paid $2,350,000 for his residence in the Russian Hill neighborhood, which he put on the market in April 2009, for $2,995,000.\n\nNewsom's first political experience came when he volunteered for Willie Brown's successful campaign for mayor in 1995. Newsom hosted a private fundraiser at his PlumpJack Café. In 1996, Brown appointed Newsom to a vacant seat on the Parking and Traffic Commission, and he was later elected president of the commission. In 1997, Brown appointed him to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors seat vacated by Kevin Shelley. At the time, he became the youngest member of San Francisco's board of supervisors and also, like Shelley before him, the board's only heterosexual Caucasian male.\nNewsom was sworn in by his father and pledged to bring his business experience to the board. Brown called Newsom \"part of the future generation of leaders of this great city.\" Newsom described himself as a \"social liberal and a fiscal watchdog.\" Newsom was subsequently elected to a full four-year term to the board in 1998. In 1999, San Francisco's voters chose to exchange at-large elections to the board for the previous district system and Newsom was reelected in 2000 and in 2002 to represent the second district, which includes the Pacific Heights, Marina, Cow Hollow, Sea Cliff, and Laurel Heights. He faced no opposition in his 2002 reelection. His district had the highest income level and the highest Republican registration in San Francisco. In 2000, Newsom paid $500 to the San Francisco Republican Party to be on the party's endorsement slate.\nAs a San Francisco Supervisor, Newsom gained public attention for his role in advocating reform of the city's Municipal Railway (\"Muni\"). He was one of two supervisors endorsed by Rescue Muni, a transit riders group, in his 1998 reelection. He sponsored Proposition B to require Muni and other city departments to develop detailed customer service plans. The measure passed with 56.6% of the vote. Newsom sponsored a ballot measure from Rescue Muni; a version of the measure was approved by voters in November 1999.\n\nNewsom also supported allowing restaurants to serve alcohol at their outdoor tables, banning tobacco advertisements visible from the streets, stiffer penalties for landlords, and a resolution to commend Colin Powell for raising money for youth programs that was defeated. Newsom's support for business interests at times strained his relationship with labor leaders.\n\nDuring Newsom's time as supervisor, he supported housing projects through public–private partnerships to increase homeownership and affordable housing in San Francisco. Newsom supported HOPE, a failed local ballot measure that would have allowed an increased condo-conversion rate if a certain percentage of tenants within a building were buying their units. As a candidate for mayor, he supported building 10,000 new housing units to create 15,000 new construction jobs.\n\nAs supervisor, Newsom had as his centerpiece a voter initiative called Care Not Cash (Measure N), which offered care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists for the homeless in lieu of direct cash aid from the state's general assistance program. Many homeless rights advocates protested against the initiative. The successfully passed ballot measure raised the political profile of Gavin Newsom and provided the volunteers, donors, and campaign staff that helped make him a leading contender for the mayorship in 2003.\n\nNewsom placed first in the November 4, 2003, general election in a nine-person field. Newsom received 41.9 percent of the vote to Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez's 19.6 in the first round of balloting, but he faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff when many of the city's liberal groups coalesced around Gonzalez. The race was partisan with attacks against Gonzalez for his support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election and attacks against Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate mailer in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported. Democratic leadership felt that they needed to reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the 2003 recall election to Arnold Schwarzenegger. National figures from the Democratic Party, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson, campaigned on Newsom's behalf. Five supervisors endorsed Gonzalez while Newsom received the endorsement of Willie Brown.\n\nNewsom won the runoff race, capturing 53 percent of the vote to Gonzalez's 47 percent and winning by 11,000 votes. Newsom ran as a business-friendly centrist Democrat and a moderate in San Francisco politics; some of his opponents called him conservative. Newsom claimed he was a centrist in the Dianne Feinstein mold. He ran on the slogan \"great cities, great ideas\" and presented over 21 policy papers. He pledged to continue working on San Francisco's homelessness issue.\n\nNewsom was sworn in as mayor on January 3, 2004. He called for unity among the city's political factions and promised to address the issues of potholes, public schools, and affordable housing. Newsom said he was \"a different kind of leader\" who \"isn't afraid to solve even the toughest problems.\"\n\nSan Francisco's progressive community attempted to find a candidate to run a strong campaign against Newsom. Supervisors Ross Mirkarimi and Chris Daly considered running against Newsom, but both declined. Matt Gonzalez also decided not to challenge Newsom.\n\nWhen the August 10, 2007, filing deadline passed, the discussion around San Francisco shifted to talk about Newsom's second term. He was challenged in the election by 13 candidates that included George Davis, a nudist activist, and Michael Powers, owner of the Power Exchange sex club. Conservative former supervisor Tony Hall withdrew by early September due to lack of support.\n\nThe \"San Francisco Chronicle\" declared in August 2007 that Newsom faced no \"serious threat to his reelection bid\", having raised $1.6 million for his reelection campaign by early August. He won re-election on November 6, 2007 with over 72% of the vote. Upon taking office for a second term, Newsom promised to focus on the environment, homelessness, health care, education, housing, and rebuilding San Francisco General Hospital.\n\nAs mayor, Newsom focused on development projects in Hunters Point and Treasure Island. He signed the Healthy San Francisco Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with universal healthcare. In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, in violation of the state law passed in 2000.\n\nImplementation of Care Not Cash began on July 1, 2004. As part of his Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more homeless people were given permanent shelter in the city. , about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic homelessness include the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project Homeless Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line in front of the Westin St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.\n\nIn 2005, Newsom pushed for a state law to allow communities in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The animal control agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California.\n\nIn 2009, Newsom came under attack from the San Francisco Democratic Party for his failure to implement the City of San Francisco's sanctuary city rule, under which the city was to not assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Instead, he was sending immigrant suspects, including youths, to ICE before they were even given their day in court.\n\nIn 2009, Newsom received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and three other public officials for his commitment to making healthful food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families. In 2008, he had hosted the Urban Rural Roundtable to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy affordable food, and he secured $8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program, which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes. He signed a menu-labeling bill into law, requiring that chain restaurants print nutrition information on their menus. In 2010, Newsom was named \"America's Most Social Mayor\" by Samepoint, based on analysis of the social media profiles of mayors from the 100 largest cities in the United States. That same year, Newsom was removed from the San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee, because, according to SFCDCC chairman Aaron Peskin, Newsom no longer resided in the city.\n\nIn 2002, then-San Francisco Supervisor Newsom promoted the Care Not Cash program which cut county general assistance programs to be replaced with housing and other forms of service. He also promoted a 2003 ban (Proposition M: Aggressive Solicitation Ban) on aggressive panhandling which included a ban for panhandling on public transportation and near ATMs. It also prohibited repeatedly soliciting money, blocking the way, touching or following a person while soliciting, or intentionally trying to intimidate.\n\nOn June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom pledged to fix San Francisco's homeless problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated that people who were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people being sent to the home of a willing family member or friend through the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.\n\nIn 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, in violation of the then-current state law. In August 2004, the Supreme Court of California annulled the marriages that Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law at that time. Still, Newsom's unexpected move brought national attention to the issues of gay marriage, solidifying political support for Newsom in San Francisco and in the gay community.\n\nDuring the 2008 election, Newsom was a prominent and vocal opponent of Proposition 8, the ballot initiative to reverse the California Supreme Court ruling that there was a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Proposition 8 supporters released a commercial featuring Newsom saying the following words in a speech regarding same-sex marriage: \"This door's wide open now. It's going to happen, whether you like it or not.\" Some observers noted that polls shifted in favor of Proposition 8 following the release of the commercial; this, in turn, led to speculation that Newsom had inadvertently played a role in the passage of the amendment.\n\nIn April 2009, Newsom announced his intention to run for governor of California in the 2010 election. In September 2009, he received the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton. During the campaign, Newsom remarked that, if elected, he'd like to be referred to as \"The Gavinator\" (a reference to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's nickname, \"The Governator\"). Throughout the campaign, however, Newsom suffered low poll numbers, trailing Democratic frontrunner Jerry Brown by more than 20 points in most polls. In October 2009, Newsom dropped out of the gubernatorial race.\n\nIn February 2010, Newsom filed initial paperwork to run for lieutenant governor, and officially announced his candidacy in March. He received the Democratic nomination in June, and won the election on November 2, 2010. Newsom was sworn in as lieutenant governor on January 10, 2011. The one-week delay was to ensure that a successor as mayor of San Francisco was chosen before he left office. Edwin M. Lee, the city administrator, took office the day after Newsom was sworn in as lieutenant governor. In May 2012, he debuted on Current TV as the host of \"The Gavin Newsom Show\". In 2012, Newsom drew criticism for his negative view of California's state capital Sacramento.\n\nOn November 4, 2014, Newsom was re-elected as lieutenant governor of California, defeating Republican Ron Nehring with 57.2% of the vote. His second term began on January 5, 2015, the same date when Governor Brown was sworn in for a second term after his re-election.\n\nNewsom released his first book, \"Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government\", on February 7, 2013. The book discusses the Gov 2.0 movement that is taking place across the United States. Following the release of \"Citizenville\", Newsom began to work with the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at the University of California, Berkeley on the California Report Card (CRC). The CRC is a mobile-optimized platform that allows California residents to \"grade\" their state on six timely issues. The CRC exemplifies ideas presented in Newsom's \"Citizenville\", encouraging direct public involvement in government affairs via modern technology.\n\nIn 2015, Newsom partnered with the Institute for Advanced Technology and Public Policy at California Polytechnic State University to launch Digital Democracy, an online tool that uses facial and voice recognition to enable users to navigate California legislative proceedings.\n\nIn November 2015, Newsom joined then-Long Beach City College Superintendent Eloy Oakley in an op-ed calling for the creation of the California College Promise, which would create partnerships between public schools, public universities and employers and offer a free community college education. Throughout 2016, Newsom joined Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf at the launch of the Oakland Promise and then-Second Lady Jill Biden and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti at the launch of the LA Promise. In June 2016, the Lieutenant Governor helped secure $15 million in the state budget to support the creation of promise programs throughout the state.\n\nIn December 2015, Newsom called on the University of California to reclassify computer science courses as a core academic class in order to incentivize more high schools to offer computer science curriculum. Newsom sponsored successful legislation signed by Governor Brown in September 2016, that began the planning process for expanding computer science education to all California students, beginning as early as kindergarten.\n\nIn 2016, the Lieutenant Governor passed a series of reforms at the University of California to provide student-athletes with additional academic and injury-related support, and to ensure that contracts for athletic directors and coaches emphasized academic progress. This came in response to several athletics programs, including the University of California - Berkeley's football team, which garnered the lowest graduation rates in the country.\n\nIn 2014, Newsom was the only statewide politician to endorse California Proposition 47, a piece of legislation that decriminalized nonviolent offenses like drug and property crimes, turning them into misdemeanors as opposed to felonies.\n\nIn July 2015, Newsom released the final report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy, which he had convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013. The report's recommendations to regulate marijuana were intended to inform a legalization measure on the November 2016 ballot. Newsom supported the resulting measure, Proposition 64, which legalized cannabis use and cultivation for California state residents who are 21 or older.\n\nIn response to pro-enforcement statements made by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Newsom sent a letter on February 24, 2017, to Attorney General Sessions and President Trump, urging them not to increase federal enforcement against recreational cannabis firms opening up in California. He wrote, \"The government must not strip the legal and publicly supported industry of its business and hand it back to drug cartels and criminals ... Dealers don't card kids. I urge you and your administration to work in partnership with California and the other eight states that have legalized recreational marijuana for adult use in a way that will let us enforce our state laws that protect the public and our children, while targeting the bad actors.\" Newsom responded to comments by Spicer which compared cannabis to opioids saying, \"Unlike marijuana, opioids represent an addictive and harmful substance, and I would welcome your administration's focused efforts on tackling this particular public health crisis.\"\n\nNewsom supported a failed measure in 2012 that sought to end capital punishment in California. He claimed the initiative would save California millions of dollars, citing statistics that California had spent $5 billion since 1978 to execute just 13 people.\n\nNewsom also supported failed Proposition 62 in 2016, which also would have repealed the death penalty in California. He argued that Prop 62 would get rid of a system \"that is administered with troubling racial disparities.\" He also stated that the death penalty was fundamentally immoral and did not deter crime.\n\nOn February 11, 2015, Newsom announced that he was opening a campaign account for governor in the 2018 elections, allowing him to raise funds for a campaign to succeed Jerry Brown as the fortieth Governor of California. On June 5, 2018, he finished in the top two of the nonpartisan blanket primary, and defeated Republican John H. Cox in the gubernatorial election on November 6.\n\nNewsom was baptized and reared in his father's Roman Catholic faith. He describes himself as an \"Irish Catholic rebel [...] in some respects, but one that still has tremendous admiration for the Church and very strong faith.\" When asked about the current state of the Catholic Church, he said the church was in crisis. Newsom said he stays with the Church because of his \"strong connection to a greater purpose, and [...] higher being [...]\" Newsom identifies himself as a practicing Catholic, stating that he has a \"strong sense of faith that is perennial: day in and day out.\"\n\nIn December 2001, Newsom married Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former San Francisco prosecutor and legal commentator for Court TV, CNN, and MSNBC and later became a prominent personality on Fox News Channel. The couple married at Saint Ignatius Catholic Church on the campus of the University of San Francisco, where Guilfoyle attended law school. The couple appeared in the September 2004 issue of \"Harper's Bazaar\", a fashion magazine, in a spread of them at the Getty Villa with the title the \"New Kennedys.\" In January 2005, they jointly filed for divorce, citing \"difficulties due to their careers on opposite coasts.\" Their divorce was finalized on February 28, 2006.\n\nIn 2005, Newsom was selected as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.\n\nIn January 2007, it was revealed that Newsom had had a romantic relationship in mid-2005 with Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the wife of his then campaign manager and former deputy chief of staff, Alex Tourk. Tourk filed for divorce shortly after the revelation and left Newsom's campaign and administration. Newsom's affair with Rippey-Tourk impacted his popularity with male voters, who viewed the adultery as a betrayal of a close friend and ally.\n\nIn September 2006, Newsom began dating film director Jennifer Siebel. In February 2007, he announced he would seek treatment for alcohol abuse. In December 2007, Newsom and Siebel announced their engagement, and they were married in Stevensville, Montana, in July 2008. In September 2009, Siebel gave birth to a girl, Montana Tessa Newsom. Siebel gave birth to a son, Hunter Siebel Newsom, on June 12, 2011, their daughter Brooklynn on July 3, 2013 and on February 26, 2016, the Newsoms announced the birth of second son, Dutch.\n\nIn 2012, Newsom and his family moved out of San Francisco and bought a house in Kentfield, California in Marin County.\n\n"}

{"id": "4722979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4722979", "title": "Janitor (Scrubs)", "text": "Janitor (Scrubs)\n\nThe Janitor is a fictional character, played by actor Neil Flynn in the American comedy-drama \"Scrubs\". Though he is a janitor at Sacred Heart, he is rarely referred to as \"the\" janitor, but rather just called Janitor.\n\nNeil Flynn was originally billed as a recurring guest star throughout Season 1, although he appeared in all 24 episodes of that season. He was promoted to a series regular beginning with Season 2 and remained a regular through to Season 8. He made his final appearance in the Season 9 premiere, \"Our First Day of School\", as a guest star.\n\nJanitor appeared in every episode during the first eight seasons except Season 2's \"My Lucky Day\" and Season 8's \"My Last Words\", \"My Absence\" and \"My Full Moon\".\n\nIn the series' pilot episode, protagonist J.D. sees Janitor fixing a sliding door that is stuck, and suggests someone might have stuck a penny in the door. Janitor immediately accuses J.D. of sabotaging the door, and swears revenge. For the rest of the series, Janitor makes it his personal mission to torment J.D. with insults, mind games and practical jokes. In the season eight finale, J.D. admits to accidentally sticking the penny in the door; Janitor replies he saw J.D. do it and began torturing him because he failed a \"test of character\" by keeping silent about it. Some of Janitor's practical jokes have been on the severe side, such as destroying J.D.'s bike (twice), trapping him in a water tower, stranding him in the middle of nowhere, and tricking him into robbing a couple's house.\n\nNeil Flynn has said: \n\nIt is suggested in the episode \"His Story III\" that he is in some way responsible for a medical intern named Jill having a child.\n\nDuring the first six seasons he has a crush on Dr. Elliot Reid, but in season seven he meets his future wife Lady, and they get married the following season.\n\nIn the first episode of season 9, a flashback is seen of Janitor's last appearance the day after J.D. leaves Sacred Heart. Janitor believes that J.D. is simply hiding, as a practical joke, and will reappear. When Turk convinces him that J.D. has left for good, Janitor hands over his mop to Turk and leaves, never to be seen again.\n\nConcrete information about Janitor's personal history is sparse and is confounded by his penchant for giving outrageous (and often conflicting) accounts of his past. Many of the stories he has told J.D. are patently absurd, some bordering on the surreal or fantastical.\n\nHe has claimed that his parents are also his siblings, has made multiple conflicting accounts of having been married and having children, has claimed that, in college, he came close to a world record in the 100m hurdles race, and has given an explanation for learning sign language so convoluted that he asks to have it read back to him when J.D. asks if any part of it is true. His childhood and family life are equally mysterious. The occasional flashback sequences imply that his parents were fastidious and mildly abusive. One flashback implies the loss of a stuffed animal in the \"clutter\" of his bedroom led him to take on a janitorial career. He also claims that his great-grandfather was the Civil War general Ambrose Burnside (mispronounced \"Burnsides\"). However, it is hinted on some occasions that Janitor's anecdotes are at times true to some degree, e.g. he does show a considerable skill in hurdles racing in the same episode in which he claims to almost have broken said world record.\n\nJanitor speaks Spanish, Korean, German, Italian and American Sign Language. When the hospital support staff wants dental coverage, he becomes their spokesman.\n\nOn occasion Janitor indicates he does little actual work. He tells J.D. that he spends only an hour and a half a day performing his duties at work. He does, however, defend his sanitary responsibilities in the hospital whenever J.D. questions him about it, and he takes great pride in the cleanliness of the hospital's floors.\n\nAlthough he spends most of the series harassing J.D., on occasion Janitor will torment other characters such as Christopher Turk. This is usually in response to a perceived wrong, such as another character creating a mess in the hospital or disrespecting him.\n\nSeveral episodes show Janitor pretending to be a doctor (\"Dr. Ján Ĩtor\") and he also greatly enjoys one occasion when he is asked to assist during a medical emergency. On one occasion, he uses a set of broken defibrillator paddles to pretend to revive a patient (in reality, a pair of pillows and a mop). He also pretends to be the chief of medicine when the real chief, Bob Kelso, is away.\n\nJanitor shows a softer side on several occasions. He harbors a schoolboy crush on Elliot Reid, to whom he usually refers as \"Blonde Doctor\". He has also shown genuine compassion for the hospital's patients; in one episode he spends the day talking to a patient with Locked-in syndrome just to keep him company. In another, he joins the others in saying a heartfelt farewell to Nurse Laverne Roberts, who dies of injuries suffered in a car accident. Later, as the hospital mourns Laverne's passing at a bar, Janitor buys them a round of drinks and raises his glass in salute. He later reveals he and Kelso had both slept with Laverne.\n\nFlynn had a small role in \"The Fugitive\". The show's writers took advantage of this, placing Janitor (in his fictional role) as the real actor in the film. J.D. notices this as he watches the movie. When J.D. confronts Janitor, he (eventually) admits that it really was him- after J.D. explains that he wanted it to be Janitor as it would show him to be more than a bitter wretch but a man who once had hopes and dreams, even if they didn't work out- but admonishes him not to tell anyone.\n\nJanitor's father is portrayed as having treated him the way a drill instructor would treat a new recruit. (His father is played by actor R. Lee Ermey, who famously played a drill instructor in \"Full Metal Jacket\".) However, Janitor later tells J.D. that his father died when he was young. When J.D. remembers meeting his father, Janitor responds mysteriously that \"You met \"a man\".\"\n\nAt the beginning of the eighth season, Maddox fires Janitor for pulling a prank on J.D. that could have resulted in serious injury. At the end of the episode, he is replaced. He is rehired due to a clerical error.\n\nJanitor is the self-appointed leader of the \"Brain Trust\", an unofficial club at the hospital that consists of a rotating cast of Sacred Heart staff members such as hospital lawyer Ted Buckland, surgeon Todd \"The Todd\" Quinlan, Dr. Doug Murphy (whom Janitor calls \"Nervous Guy\"), and Lloyd Slawski, a delivery man. The Brain Trust originally had three other members, but Janitor became fed up with them during lunch, and joined the table behind him where the new members were sitting.\n\nThe mystery of Janitor's name is a running gag throughout the series. In several episodes, he calls himself \"Janitor\" (even in his own mind), and in many episodes he refers to himself as \"Doctor Ján Ĩtor\".\n\nIn \"My Hero\", Janitor chastises J.D. for not even knowing his name while Janitor knows many personal details about J.D.'s life (though it's later shown Janitor has been breaking into J.D.'s locker and reading his journal). When J.D. protests that he does in fact know Janitor's real name, Janitor asks him to say it aloud and quickly claps his hand over his name badge so J.D. can't read it.\n\nIn \"My Manhood\", Janitor tells Dr. Cox \"I've been called a great many horrible names in my life: backstabber, zebra poacher, Josh...\"\n\nIn the beginning of the eighth season, when Sacred Heart's new Chief of Medicine, Dr. Maddox (played by Courteney Cox Arquette), asks what Janitor's name is, he chuckles and makes reference to the fact she's new, alluding to the fact that she's oblivious to the fact even the longest-standing members of staff don't know his name. She examines his name tag only to find it says \"The Janitor.\"\n\nBill Lawrence gave a hint toward Janitor's name at a speech at The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia on January 29, 2009. He said that the only clue he had given was that Janitor's name is the same as the janitor on \"Clone High\" (Glenn, voiced by Neil Flynn).\n\nIn the Season 8 finale Janitor tells J.D. that his name is Glenn Matthews; \"My Finale\" was the series finale, in which Janitor's real name would be revealed. When J.D. asks why Janitor is revealing his name only now, Janitor points out that J.D. has never before asked what his name is, and proves that J.D. has already forgotten it. However just a few seconds later, someone else walks by and calls Janitor by another name, \"Tommy,\" to which he responds.\n\nIn a Twitter post on April 5, 2011, Bill Lawrence confirmed that Janitor was telling the truth when he revealed his name as Glenn Matthews.\n\nAs revealed in the DVD commentary on several episodes, the Janitor character was initially to be used as a figment of J.D.'s imagination if the show had been canceled during the first season or the first half of the second. This would have been revealed to the audience in the finale.\n\nFrom the beginning of Season 2, Flynn joins the rest of the main cast appearing in the show's extended opening credits, but the credits were changed back due to objections by NBC, who wanted longer episodes instead. However, he was still acknowledged as a main cast member by the producers as of the second season. Since the start of season two, Janitor has had encounters with most of the other regular characters. He has even had an entire episode (\"His Story III\") devoted mostly to him. Along with this, in the season 1 episode \"My Bad\", Elliott throws coffee on the floor and as Janitor looks up in anger she seemingly engages with him and sarcastically says \"sorry\".\n\nFlynn is an improv comedian and, as such, ad-libs many of his lines. Although it is often stated that Flynn ad-libs all of his lines, on several parts of the Season One DVD commentaries and special features, both Flynn and series creator Bill Lawrence say that it is generally a mix of ad-libbed lines and the original script, with Flynn usually building on the original lines. Lawrence has also said that the rest of the cast followed Flynn's lead and that he (Lawrence) would occasionally enter the rehearsal room with no idea what scene was taking place due to its lack of resemblance to the original script. Janitor's alter ego, Dr. Ján Ĩtor, is a happy consequence of one such moment of inspiration. Sam Lloyd once commented on Flynn's improvising: \"I opened my script up once and it said 'Janitor: Whatever Neil says,' and I just started laughing.\"\n\nFlynn originally auditioned for the role of Dr. Cox (which ultimately went to John C. McGinley). However, Lawrence asked Flynn if he would consider another part: the mysterious custodian who makes tormenting J.D. his life's work.\n\nThe role of Janitor was originally devised as a one-time gag in the series' pilot episode, Lawrence admitted: \"When we watched the pilot, we knew instantly we had to keep this guy around.\"\n\nIn flashback scenes of Janitor's childhood, he is played by Brandon Waters.\n"}

{"id": "4967479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4967479", "title": "José María Pino Suárez", "text": "José María Pino Suárez\n\nJosé María Pino Suárez (; 8 September 1869 – 19 February 1913) was a Mexican statesman, jurist, poet, journalist and revolutionary who served as the seventh and last Vice President of Mexico from 1911 until shortly before his assassination in 1913. In 1969, he was awarded the Belisario Domínguez Medal post mortem. He dedicated his short life to fighting for democracy and advocating against social injustices in Mexico.\n\nBorn in the southern state of Tabasco, he moved at a very young age to Mérida, Yucatán, to pursue his education. Shortly after graduating from law school, he established a law firm and began to write poetry, for which he was later offered a seat in the Spanish Academy. As an entrepreneur, he also established the newspaper \"El Peninsular\" in which he made the public aware of the social injustices occurring in the Yucatán peninsula at the time. Joining the pro-democratic cause of Francisco I. Madero, José Maria Pino Suárez was important in establishing the Antireelectionist party in the south of the Republic. Fighting against the political oligarchy that controlled Yucatán, and to which he belonged through family and business ties, he was declared a candidate of the Antireelectionist party as Governor of Yucatán but was soon arrested by order of the official party. Fleeing from arrest, he joined presidential candidate Madero (himself fleeing from the oppression of the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz) in the United States.) There Pino Suárez helped to draft the Plan of San Luis Potosí, which declared the 1910 presidential elections to be null and void, and ignited the Mexican Revolution. Under the plan, Madero was declared substitute president and in his cabinet, Pino Suárez was declared Minister of Justice.\n\nFollowing the capture of Ciudad Juárez by revolutionary troops, Pino Suárez was one of the key negotiators and signers of the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez, which led to Porfirio Díaz resigning as president on 25 May 1911, and the end of his 30-year-long dictatorship. Returning to Yucatán, Pino Suárez was declared interim governor by the local assembly after the resignation of Enrique Muñoz Arristegui. In the special elections of 1911 he won a majority of votes and was sworn in as Constitutional Governor of Yucatán. His term, however was short. Soon after his victory the Progressive Constitutional Party (a successor of the Antireelectionist party) nominated him as vice presidential running mate of Madero. On 15 October 1911, he won the vice-presidency with a comfortable majority and he was subsequently sworn in on 6 November by the Congress of the Union. In 1912 alongside the Vice-presidency, he was also selected as Minister of Education and Fine Arts.\n\nIn 1913, during the events of the Ten Tragic Days, a group of convicted army officers escaped from prison and launched a military coup against the President. Although at first the coup was unsuccessful in taking over the seat of the executive, Palacio Nacional, and was contained to one small area of the centre of Mexico City known as La Ciudadela, soon the General appointed to quash the rebellion, Victoriano Huerta entered into negotiations with the American Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson and with the rebels. Turning sides, Huerta soon captured the unsuspecting President and his entire cabinet. Pino Suárez who has been urged by many to flee the capital along with his family in case things came to worse, decided to remain by the side of the President while the usurpation was dealt with. Held in captivity along with the President in Palacio Nacional, both men were forced at gun point and under false premises to resign to their respective posts. Shortly thereafter, both were assassinated, provoking a national and international outcry that led to them becoming national martyrs. Pino Suárez has been labelled \"el caballero de la lealtad\" (the loyal gentleman) for his steadfastness to the President in such a difficult situation. Outrage for their deaths, was a main catalyst behind President Woodrow Wilson's decision to order the United States occupation of Veracruz in 1914, and in causing the fall of the unpopular Huerta Dictatorship, the last military dictatorship in Mexican history. Their sacrifice ultimately paved the way for the establishment of democracy in Mexico and for the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution.\n\nPino Suárez was born on 8 September 1869 in Tenosique, Tabasco, to Alfredo Pino Camára and Josefa Baltasara Suárez. He was a direct descendant of war hero Pedro Sainz de Baranda who famously led the capitulation of the fort of San Juan de Ulúa in 1825, thus conquering the last Spanish foothold in Mexican territory, and effectively ending the Mexican War of Independence. Other members of the distinguished Baranda family include two of Sainz de Baranda's sons, Joaquín Baranda and Pedro Baranda who were Pino Suárez's uncles. The former was a gifted historian, politician and writer who held the Governorship of Campeche on several occasions, as well as being appointed Minister of Justice by President Manuel González, a position he would hold for nearly twenty years thereafter. The latter, General Pedro Baranda would play a crucial role in the existence of the states of Campeche and Morelos, distinguishing himself as the first Governor of the latter. During the War of Reform, General Pedro Barranda supported President Benito Juárez. Another uncle of José Maria Pino Suárez was Joaquín Demetrio Casasús, a prominent jurist, economist, politician and writer. The grandparents of Pino Suárez were (paternally) Tomás Pino and Perfecta Salvatiel. On the maternal branch, his grandparents were José Eusebio Suárez and Baltasara Abreu. At a young adolescent age, Pino Suárez left Tenosique for Yucatán, where he studied at the Catholic School of San Idelfonso, which followed a programme closely linked to the French Lycée. On 12 September 1894, Pino concluded his legal studies at the Escuela Nacional de Jurisprudencia de Yucatán.\n\nFrom a young age Pino Suárez was a member of the Literary Academy founded in 1875 in Mérida. Here he would read and be influenced by the works of such figures such as Edgar Allan Poe, Victor Hugo, Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred de Vigny, Alfred de Musset, Théophile Gautier, Honoré de Balzac, George Sand, Charles Dickens, Lord Byron and Eça de Queiroz, among others. Pino Suárez acclaimed poetic works would first be published in the magazine \"Piminenta y Mostaza\", which included further collaborations from other recognized literary figures such as Manuel Sales Cepeda, Fernando Juanes and José I Novelo (who would later serve as the personal private secretary of Pino Suárez.)\n\nSeveral of Pino Suárez's poetic works were included in the book \"Los Trovadores de Mexico\" published in Barcelona. This would catch the eye of prominent members of the Real Academia Española, the Academy of the Spanish Language, of which he would later be a part. Two of his most famous books, \"Melancolias\" (1905) and \"Procelerias\" (1908) are anthologies of his distinguished poetic works. It should be noted, that much of Pino Suárez's early literary career was done simultaneously to his legal career. For three years from 1896–1899, Pino Suárez practised in his own legal firm in the capital before returning to Yucatán to carry out commercial activities with his wealthy father-in-law, Raymundo Camara-Luján. It was after his return to Yucatán that Pino Suárez's political career began with his founding of the newspaper, \"El Peninsular\". His newspaper soon caught the public eye for its criticism of the Diaz dictatorship and for the bad treatment of workers in the Henequen plantations of Yucatán. At a time of close censorship, it was favoured by many for its veracity and independence. Not surprisingly, in 1905, \" El Peninsular\" was closed by the Government of Yucatán, and Pino Suárez faced prosecution. It was at this time that he retired to his large sugar plantations of \"Polyuc\". While exiled in his hacienda, he wrote several other works of poetry including \"Sursum\" and the poem he dedicated to his various sons and daughters.\n\nWhile Pino Suárez's was in \"Polyuc\" from 1906 to 1909, the name of Francisco I. Madero first came to the light with his publication of the book \"La Sucesión Presidencial en 1910\" (1908). In this book Madero - himself a member of one of the richest families of Mexico - criticized President Porfirio Díaz who had for over three decades ruled as a dictator. Madero established in his book the necessity for clean elections in 1910, and for an end to the practice of re-election, which throughout Mexican history had seen a series of caudillos perpetuating power. Among these caudillos were figures such as General Antonio López de Santa Anna and Porfirio Díaz. Madero's stirring book lead to the foundation of an Antireelectionist party. In 1910, they would try to take power by constitutional means, thus returning democracy to the Mexican Republic. This party included prominent public figures such as José Vasconcelos, Paulino Martínez, Emilio Vásquez Gómez, Toribio Esquivel Obregón, Felix F. Palavicini and Luis Cabrera among others. The Antireelectionists began political activities in the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, and Yucatán.\nIt was during the 1909 visit of Madero to Yucatán, that the two met for the first time. Pino Suárez soon became President of the Antireelectionist Party in Yucatán, where the conditions were propitious for the growth of the party. Here Pino Suárez enlisted the aid of distinguished figures and personal friends, among them Calixto Maldonando, head of the freemasons. By 1910, the power of the party in Yucatán had grown to such a degree that by 1910, Pino Suárez would be elected Governor of Yucatán.\n\nWhen the sitting governor of Yucatán, Olegario Molina (himself a relative of Pino Suárez's spouse), resigned the governorship to become a cabinet minister, he was replaced by Enrique Muñoz Arrístegui, who was selected as interim governor until the upcoming elections of 1910. Soon, the public began to gossip of Muñoz Arrístegui as the Díaz-backed candidate. In those days, presidential backing was an assurance of victory, and so it was to be. With Muñoz as governor, soon the anti-reelectionist leaders were arrested. Pino Suárez, the anti-reelectionist candidate, managed to flee Yucatán. The anti-reelectionists were the only opposition to the dictatorship. With this, and other electoral fraud, Muñoz Arrestegui managed to cling on to power.\n\nPino Suárez escaped to his native Tabasco, and afterwards to the United States where he would meet with Madero. On 15 April, as the day of the elections came closer and closer, the members of the Antireelectionist club and of the Nationalist Democratic Party met under the chairmanship of Pino Suárez. It was at that convention, that Madero came out as the presidential nominee of the Antireelectionist Party, and Francisco Vázquez Gómez as the vice presidential nominee. José María Pino Suárez came out of the convention as a nominee for the Supreme Court of Justice. This convention was followed by rallies, speeches, and propaganda, which were swiftly ended with the order of President Díaz for the arrest of Madero on 7 June. The Antireelectionists had tried to gain power legally and pacifically but the Government had not allowed them to follow this strategy. Thus, Madero and his party were faced with no option but revolution, as Madero proclaimed \"force must be met by force!\".\n\nAt around the same time that Madero was arrested, people in Valladolid, Yucatán, held a massive protest against the electoral fraud of Muñoz Arrestegui. Pino Suárez's duty was to return to his native south and penetrate Yucatán with the ideas of democracy. Although Pino Suárez had to flee to British Honduras (Belize) in order to escape prosecution from the government, from outside of the country he still led the revolution in the south. In this manner while Madero ignited revolution from prison in the north, Pino Suárez assured victory in the south.\n\nShortly after the imprisonment of Madero and the exile of Pino Suárez, President Díaz won the presidency for yet another term. It was at around this time that Madero, with the help of his very wealthy and influential father, managed to escape prison in San Luis Potosí, and flee across the border to San Antonio, Texas. It was there in the United States that he issued the plan of San Luis Potosí calling the Mexican people to raise arms against oppression, effectively beginning the Mexican Revolution. In the plan of San Luis, Madero was quick to declare the elections of 1910 giving victory to Díaz to be null and void and declared himself to be the rightful president, thus forming a government in Ciudad Juárez. Pino Suárez was invited to join this government as Minister of Justice. Thus risking his own life, Pino Suárez went to Ciudad Juárez with Madero. The fall of Ciudad Juárez was a step too far for President Díaz. In May 1911, he called a council for peace. Representing the revolutionary cause in this council were Madero, Vázquez Gómez and Pino Suárez, while the government was represented by the Secretary of Finance José Yves Limantour. The council called for the resignation of Díaz, and of his vice president, Ramón Corral and for new and fair elections to be held later in 1911. Until these elections were held, the council agreed that León de la Barra, the current Secretary of Foreign Affairs would remain as interim President. Under the Constitution of 1857, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs was to succeed the vice president in the line of succession if the latter resigned. After giving up power Díaz left Mexico on 31 May for exile in Paris. Several members of his cabinet and close associates also followed him to exile in Europe.\n\nFollowing the council of peace, several porfirian governors who had won by electoral fraud resigned. Among them was Muñoz Arrestegui, Pino Suárez's old rival to the governorship. With Muñoz gone the people called on to Pino Suárez to serve as interim Governor of Yucatán. Once in power, Pino Suárez set about calling for several reforms to a province that had suffered heavily during the revolution. Among these reforms was a law to reform rural education, which among other things decreed pensions for teachers and attempted to help stop illiteracy in the country. Several prisoners who had committed minor crimes and showed to be reeducated were also pardoned as a sign of good will and justice. This went hand in hand with other legal reforms to stop several corrupt practices, and fight vengeful justice. Steps were quickly taken for agrarian reform, although this would be a process that would last a long time. Pino Suárez also called for the protection of lobster, which was quickly becoming extinct. For an interim Governor, these reforms were several. However, Pino Suárez promised to do more should he be elected to governorship in elections to be held later that year. At last he was Governor of Yucatán by the will of the people.\n\nNevertheless, his time in office was short, for in November 1911 he would resign this post to become Vice President of the Republic, leaving behind his brother in law, Nicolás Camára Vales, to remain as Governor of Yucatán in his absence.\n\nAlthough the convention of 1910 presided by Pino Suárez had nominated Madero as President and Vázquez Gómez as Vice President, the situation by 1911 had changed. Causing much controversy, the convention of the newly created Progressive Constitutional Party (formerly the Antireelectionist Party) nominated Pino Suárez to be their Vice Presidential candidate instead of Vasquez Gomez. Winning the cleanest election in Mexican history by a clear and comfortable majority, by November Madero and Pino Suárez were inaugurated President and Vice President of the Republic by popular mandate. In February 1912, Madero also appointed him simultaneously to the cabinet post of \"Secretario de Educacion y Bellas Artes\" (Secretary of Education and the Arts). In such a post, Pino Suárez showed his real concern for education as a necessity for the progress of the nation. He would work tirelessly to bring literacy to the most remote parts of the country, a job for which he was later praised by his 20th century successor José Vasconcelos. Pino Suárez education system called for a secular and intensive programme funded by the state. During his time as Secretary of Education, the Escuela Libre de Derecho was formed as a break away from the National School of Jurisprudence, which was headed by Pino Suárez appointed rector, Luis Cabrera.\n\nThe Revolution of 1910 had been thought of as a means of overthrowing the dictator and establishing democracy. However, the result of it was very different from the intention causing widespread social upheaval. Although Madero tried to govern in the most constitutional, just and democratic of ways, several reactionary elements within the country wanted a return to the ways of the old Díaz dictatorship. With Porfirio Díaz a broken man exiled in Europe, his nephew, Félix Díaz was seen as a natural successor. Throughout Madero's government several rebellions were crushed and their leaders jailed. However, Madero never sanctioned the death penalty for any of the usurpers. In 1913, General Manuel Mondragón attacked the prison where rebels Bernardo Reyes and Félix Díaz were held, with the purpose of liberating them. With these three Generals allied against the Government, the ten tragic days (\"la decena trágica\") would begin.\n\nAccompanied by Pino Suárez, Gustavo Madero and the cabinet, Madero personally lead an army from the Castle of Chapultepec, where he resided, to the National Palace, the seat of the executive, which was being attacked by the usurping generals. Soon the usurpers were forced to retire to la ciudadela, and area storing ammunition, here they would hold out against the Government. At this point Madero committed a mistake that would cost him his life: he appointed the seemingly loyal General Victoriano Huerta to head his army. Pino Suárez had never trusted Huerta, and soon his suspicions were to be proved correct when Huerta turned against Madero. With the help and support of the United States Ambassador, Henry Lane Wilson, Huerta would take over the National Palace. Pino Suárez at this time was offered to retire to the Hacienda of a close friend, but he would stay loyal to Madero to the very end. Both Madero and Pino Suárez had for long refused to resign the job the people had elected them to lead. However, now prisoners of Huerta, there was no chance of their Government continuing. With the false promise that they would be allowed exile along with their families to Cuba, Madero and Pino Suárez resigned their respective jobs. The resignation, however, were not given to Huerta but to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Pedro Lascurain. He was instructed not to hand the resignations over until Madero and Pino Suárez were aboard the cruiser \"Cuba\", which would take them to exile in the island of Cuba along with their families.\n\nHowever, Lascurain was too weak-willed to refuse Huerta the presidency he craved, and so he handed the resignations over to the Congress of the Union. The Congress, held hostage at gun point by Huerta's men accepted the resignation. Following the resignation of the President and Vice President, Lascurain himself, as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, succeeded to the Presidency. He would last a mere 45 minutes (the shortest term in history), only long enough to appoint Huerta as Secretary of the Interior, the next rank in the step of succession. Upon Lascurain's resignation, Huerta succeeded to the Presidency.\n\nNo longer President and Vice President, Madero and Pino Suárez held few hopes of being allowed their promised exile. Before his death, Pino Suárez is quoted as saying in his last letter ever written, addressed to Serapio Rendón \"we shall be greater in death than we were ever in life\". This proved to be true. They had attempted to establish democracy, and now their reward was to be death. On 22 February 1913, Madero and Pino Suárez were assassinated before the Palace of Lecumberri, while allegedly attempting to escape. It is well known that in fact the assassination had been ordered the night before by Huerta.\n\nPino Suárez died leaving several children orphans, and his young wife a widow. His body is now buried in the Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres, along with several of his ancestors, after having died in the pursuit of liberty and democracy for Mexico. Not surprisingly, to this day, he is considered a national hero and several streets and public places in Mexico are named after him, including a main street in central Mexico City where the Supreme Court of Justice Building is situated and Pino Suárez station on the Mexico City Metro. He was the last vice president of Mexico.\n\nIn 1896, Pino Suárez married María Camara Vales, a scion of the old Camara family of \"noble and impeccable lineage\", which are part of the divine caste of Yucatán. They were a happy couple and had six children, all of whom were orphaned after the infamous events of \"la decena trágica\". The oldest María (Mimi), was 15, the youngest, Jordelia was 3 months old. Their other children were Alfredo, José Abigail, Aida, and Hortensia. Widowed and peniless (the revolution had consumed all of their family's assets and estates), María Carmen Vales was forced to go to Yucatán, where her brother, Nicolás Camára Vales, was Governor (her husband's successor). In 1969, María Camara Vales was honoured with the Belisario Domínguez Medal of Honor by the Mexican Congress. Ambassador Ismael Moreno Pino is his grandson.\n\n"}

Soon he became known as one of Russia's leading libertarians. He led a working group on tax and currency within the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and pressed for changes in tax policy, which ultimately included adoption of a flat 13 percent tax rate. In Russia, he was a strong opponent of government intervention in the economy, a view that put him at odds with President Vladimir Putin. Soon Bendukidze sold his stake and moved back to Georgia.\n\nAfter the Rose Revolution, shortly after returning from Russia, he was appointed as Minister of Economy by former President Mikheil Saakashvili and the late Prime Minister Zurab Jvania in 2004. He served as Georgian Minister of Economy (June–December 2004), Minister for Reform Coordination (December 2004 – January 2008) and Head of the Chancellery of Government of Georgia (February 2008 – February 2009) and was the author of liberal reforms that overhauled Georgia's post-Soviet economy.\n\nAfter the appointment Bendukidze, Georgia experienced a yearly 9.3% economic growth in 2004–2007 and almost four times more foreign investments. The government managed to decrease the taxes fourfold, the number of licenses by 90% and to liberalize the labour market.\n\nHe created a charity called the Knowledge Foundation, and he was the force behind the establishment of the Free University of Tbilisi and the Agricultural University of Georgia.\n\nBendukidze took an active role in helping the new government of Ukraine, amid its confrontation with Russia.\n\nBendukidze was born in Tbilisi, USSR, and graduated from the Department of Biology of Tbilisi State University in 1977 and from the Postgraduate School of the Moscow State University in 1980. From 1981 to 1985, he worked for the \"Institute of Biology and Physiology of Micro-organisms\" in Puschino. From 1985 to 1988, he worked as the head of the \"Laboratory for Molecular Genetics\" at the \"Institute of Biotechnology\".\n\nBendukidze has a daughter – Anastasia Goncharova (1990– ) – who adopted the surname of her father. She took over the Knowledge Fund management from 2016, and married Ivan Mkheidze in 2017 .\nIn March 1999, Bendukidze married Natalia Zolotova, who has 2 sons from the previous marriage; her first husband died., however the couple lived separately after 2004, since Kakha Bendukidze returned to Georgia\n\nWith the onset of Perestroika, Bendukidze created a small business called \"Bioprocess\". In 1993, during the Voucher Privatization, campaign he bought stock in Uralmash. Bendukidze became a board member and later, Director-General of this company. After merging Uralmash with Izhora Plants in 1996, Bendukidze became chairman and CEO (Director-General) of the merged company, \"Objedinennie Mashinostroitelnie Zavody\" (OMZ). Under Bendukidze, OMZ became one of Russia's largest heavy engineering companies and he was one of the top twenty business leaders with an influential voice on economic policy.\n\nBy 2004 the Russian government under President Vladimir Putin had tightened its grip on strategic industries. According to Boris Berezovsky: \"Bendukidze does not belong to Putin's circle of friends and he understood sooner than everyone else that everything would be taken away from him... Bendukidze by far hasn't exhausted his potential but right now the Russian authorities do not need such talented people\". Thus, he decided to move to his native Georgia. In March 2004, he left the position of Chairman of the OMZ and later sold his interest in the company. On 2 June 2004, he became Minister for Economics of Georgia.\n\nBendukidze returned to Georgia after the Rose Revolution victory, having been appointed Minister of Economy in the new Saakashvili cabinet. Since 14 December 2004 to 31 January 2008, he was State Minister for Reform Co-ordination, coordinating government efforts to liberalize the economy.\n\nThe \"Economist\" said of Bendukidze: \"Mr Bendukidze made his name and fortune as an industrialist in neighboring Russia, putting together the country's biggest heavy-engineering group, OMZ, before returning to his native Georgia in June of this year with a mandate to reverse more than a decade of post-Soviet decay. He insists that he was taken by surprise when Georgia's president, Mikhail Saakashvili, and Prime Minister, Zurab Zhvania, nobbled him for a chat in the course of a private visit he made to Tbilisi in May, and then offered him a ministerial job the same evening. But having said yes, he is cracking ahead, doing everything that businessmen must dream of making governments do. He says that Georgia should be ready to sell 'everything that can be sold, except its conscience, and that is just the start.'\"\n\nHe was known as a committed libertarian and strong supporter of market economy, deregulation and privatization, stating that the Georgian government should sell everything except its honor. During 2004–2007, under his leadership, Georgia became the top-reforming country in the world, according to the World Bank's \"Doing Business\" report. In particular, Georgia jumped from 137th to 11th on the ease of doing business scale, ahead of Germany and France.\n\nBendukidze was pivotal in the libertarian reforms launched under Saakashvili, including one of the least restrictive labour codes, the lowest flat income tax rates (12%) and some of the lowest customs rates worldwide, along with the drastic reduction of licenses and permits for business.\n\nIn the January 2008 cabinet reshuffle, Bendukidze became Head of the State Chancellery. During his tenure, he was considered one of the most influential Georgian politicians, although he was not popular amongst opposition in the administration. He was criticized for repealing anti-monopoly legislation and introducing a liberal labor code. The opposition accused him of trying to sell off each of Georgia's strategic assets; such as sea ports, entire railway system, gas supply network, forests, etc.\n\nIn February 2009 Bendukidze retired from the public service to focus on tertiary education in Georgia, through the Knowledge Fund – a non-profit, charitable organization, founded by Bendukidze in 2007 to set up and support the Free University of Tbilisi and Agricultural University of Georgia. Between 2007 and 2012 Bendukidze had invested over 50 million USD to the Knowledge Fund – an unprecedented volume of private investment in tertiary education in Georgia. \n\nIn September 2014 the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko created the National Reforms Council to support state reforms and strategic development process. Kakha Bendukidze acts as a member of National Reforms Council 's Advisory Board along with the leading reformers of Northern and Central European countries: Valdis Dombrovskis – former Prime Minister of Latvia, Leszek Balcerowicz – former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Poland and Ivan Mikloš – former Finance Minister of Slovakia. The main task of the Advisory Board is to provide efficient proposals on the implementation of reforms in Ukraine based on the international experience. Advisory board closely cooperates with the Executive Board of the Council which includes Prime Minister of Ukraine, Speaker of the Parliament and the Head of the National Bank.\n\nSomewhat earlier, in May 2014 Bendukidze also accepted the invitation of the President of Ukraine to become a member of the Economic Advisory Council. In an interview shortly after his appointment, Bendukidze said that Ukraine \"has to take courageous steps to transform the economy.\" Proposed reforms included changes in tax system and a tough fight against corruption.\n\nThe head of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko expressed condolences over the death of his Advisor, former Minister of economic reforms of Georgia Kakha Bendukidze.\n\nBendukidze died on the 13 November 2014 in the InterContinental Hotel on Park Lane in London, after undergoing a stent heart surgery in Zurich a week prior. The former president of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili had expressed interest for Bendukidze to be buried on mount Mtatsminda in Tbilisi, in the Pantheon of public figures and writers of Georgia, but the wish of the family was that Bendukidze be buried next to his mother's grave in the Kukia Cemetery in Tbilisi.\n\n\n"}

Butler was considered an over-educated bookworm by her family, who resided at the Butler family seat Kilkenny Castle. She spoke French and was educated in a convent in France. Her mother tried to make her join a convent because she was remaining a spinster.\n\nSarah Ponsonby (1755 – 9 December 1831) lived with relatives in Woodstock, County Kilkenny, Ireland. She was a second cousin of Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough, and thus a second cousin once removed of his daughter Lady Caroline Lamb.\n\nTheir families lived 15 miles (25 km) from each other. They met in 1768, and quickly became close. Over the years they formulated a plan for a private rural retreat. It was their dream to live an unconventional life together.\n\nRather than face the possibility of being forced into unwanted marriages, they left County Kilkenny together in April 1778. Their families hunted them down and forcefully tried to make them give up their plans—but in vain. They moved to Wales with a servant, Mary Caryll, who lived and worked for them without pay for the rest of her life, and who was buried in the same plot and memorialized on the same grave marker.\n\nPutting their plan into motion, they undertook a picturesque tour of the Welsh countryside, eventually settling in North Wales. Living first in a rented home in the village of Llangollen, they moved in 1780 to a small cottage just outside the village they called Plas Newydd or \"new mansion\". They proceeded to live according to their self-devised system, though they could rely on only a modest income from intolerant relatives, and eventually a civil list pension. They \"improved\" Plas Newydd in the Gothic style with Welsh oak paneling, pointed arches, stained glass windows, and an extensive library, in which they received their many guests. They hired a gardener, a footman and two maids. This led to significant debt, and they had to rely on the generosity of friends.\n\nThey devoted their time to hosting a range of friends and curious visitors, extensive correspondence, private studies of literature and languages, and improving their estate. Over the years they added a circular stone dairy and created a sumptuous garden. Eleanor kept a diary of their activities. Llangollen people simply referred to them as \"the ladies\".\n\nAfter a couple of years, their life attracted the interest of the outside world. Their house became a haven for visitors travelling between Dublin and London, including writers such as Anna Seward, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott, but also the military leader the Duke of Wellington and the industrialist Josiah Wedgwood; aristocratic novelist Caroline Lamb, who was born a Ponsonby, came to visit too. Anne Lister from Yorkshire visited the couple, and was possibly inspired by their relationship to informally \"marry\" her own lover. Even travellers from continental Europe had heard of the couple and came to visit them, for instance Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, the German nobleman and landscape designer, wrote admiringly about them.\n\nThe ladies were known throughout Britain, but have been said to have led \"a rather unexciting life\". Queen Charlotte wanted to see their cottage and persuaded King George III to grant them a pension. Eventually their families came to tolerate them.\n\nButler and Ponsonby lived together for 50 years. Their books and glassware carried both sets of initials and their letters were jointly signed. Towards the end of their lives, they both dressed in black riding habits and men's top hats; some visitors thought it was eccentric and outdated – especially the hair powder – but neighbors thought the clothes were practical for living outdoors.\n\nRumors that they were in a sexual relationship floated around during their lives, and in 1791, a magazine described them and implied that they were in a sexual relationship. According to Patricia Hampl, they were appalled by this idea, and objected to the magazine's characterization to the point of consulting Edmund Burke over the possibility of suing the magazine for libel.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the writings of their contemporary Anne Lister, there is nothing in their extensive correspondence or diaries that indicates a sexual relationship. Some consider Butler and Ponsonby's relationship to be a Boston marriage, or a romantic relationship between two women who chose to live together and have \"marriage-like relationships\". Others conclude that the two had a non-sexual romantic friendship. Norena Shopland says that modern attitudes designed to distinguish same-sex relationships from a romantic friendship indicate they had a sexual relationship. According to Fiona Brideoake, the description of queer is more appropriate than the anachronistic and specific label of lesbian, particularly as queerness is a broad concept and significantly defined by its difference from typicality. Fiona Brideoake also writes that their relationship was celebrated by other people as a form of mourning the relationships that they could not form.\n\nMary Caryll died in 1809. Eleanor Butler died in 1829 at the age of 90. Sarah Ponsonby died two years later, age 76. They are all buried together at St Collen's Church in Llangollen. Plas Newydd is now a museum run by Denbighshire County Council. \n\nButler's Hill, near Plas Newydd, is named in honour of Eleanor Butler. The Ponsonby Arms public house, a Grade II listed building on Mill Street in Llangollen, claims to take its name from Sarah Ponsonby.\n\n\n\n"}

Although narrowly failing to make the summit of Makalu (8,462 m/27,765 ft), they nevertheless put the finances together to attempt K2 (8,611 m/28,268 ft) in 1986 with a small team consisting of themselves, Polish climber Wanda Rutkiewicz and French climber Michel Parmentier.\n\nThe start to the Barrards' K2 expedition was not a promising one: Maurice and Liliane \"had left their entire expedition budget -- thousands of dollars plus airline tickets and passports on the backseat of a taxi!\" Everything was sorted out in due course, and the Barrards, Wanda Rutkiewicz and Parmentier arrived at the K2 motel at about the same time as Alan Rouse's British expedition, then headed to Base Camp.\n\nThe Barrards' expedition ascended the mountain very slowly, spending nights at 6300, 7100, 7700, 7900, and 8300 meters (20,669; 23,294; 25,262; 25,919; and 27,250 feet, respectively) on the climb. They spent their last night before their summit attempt bivouacked with a tent but no sleeping bags. The Barrards, Rutkiewicz, and Parmentier all summited successfully by 11:00am on June 23, 1986. Wanda Rutkiewicz was the first female ascender of K2, a mere 30 minutes before Liliane Barrard. Both women summited K2 without using supplemental oxygen. \n\nThe four climbers descended only as far as their bivouac site from the night before, near the Bottleneck (a treacherous terrain feature at around 8,300 m/27,250 feet). The Barrards and their group had run out of fuel for their stoves (which are necessary to melt snow for water in order to prevent dehydration at high altitude). Parmentier descended first, to try and borrow some stove fuel from a nearby pair of Basque climbers, Mari Abrego and Josema Casimiro. The others descended after him. Rutkiewicz caught up with Parmentier; the Barrards lagged behind. The Basque climbers had also run out of gas, and accompanied Parmentier and Rutkiewicz back to the French Camp Three, at 7800m/25,600 feet.\n\nRutkiewicz and the Basques continued down the mountain, and Parmentier waited for the Barrards to reach Camp Three. The weather was deteriorating. A French climber climbing with an Italian expedition, Benoît Chamoux, tried to convince Parmentier to come down, without success, and left him a radio before turning around and heading back toward Base Camp. Eventually Parmentier, who had tried to wait for some sign of the Barrards, began to descend, in white-out conditions and gale-force winds. Parmentier was eventually guided down the mountainside via radio directions from Base Camp, about 3000m/9,843 feet below, based on the few landmarks he could find in the blizzard.\n\nRutkiewicz, suffering from frostbite, and Parmentier both reached Base Camp alive. The Barrards were never seen alive again. The morning after summiting, Maurice had been very tired, and he and Liliane had left their tent after their climbing partners. It was windy and visibility was poor. The most likely scenarios are that the Barrards wandered off-route in the storm; that they fell; or that they collapsed from exhaustion and possible hypoxia.\n\nA month later a Korean team found Liliane's body on a snow field at around , nearly lower than where she was last seen; Maurice's body was not found until 1998 on the glacier just above Base Camp, and both are now buried at the Gilkey Memorial at the base of K2.\n\n\n\n"}

Often dubbed as a voice of the revolution and a champion of women’s rights, her activism covered a wide range of activities, as an Alexandrian scholar and friend notes: \"There was not a single struggle that was off limits for Mahienour: human rights, student rights, women’s rights, labor strikes, legal aid, anti-police brutality, housing for the poor, corruption, anti-military trials, heritage preservation, right to the public space, state-led land reclamation from the poor, climate change, street children’s rights, Syrian refugees; the list goes on...Mahienour was always there, sleeping next to Syrian refugees in police stations to ensure they did not get tortured or deported, advocating for the twenty-one female supporters of the Brotherhood who were sentenced (and later acquitted) to eleven years in jail, and locating missing persons through the security labyrinth. Mahienour would rush to defend the victim’s rights—regardless of affiliation—and attend the funeral of people she had never met. Her very presence sent a message that this issue really mattered and raised protestors’ morale.\"El-Masry was sentenced to two years in prison for violating Egypt’s controversial protest law before having her sentence reduced to six months. The young activist had participated in a protest on December 3, 2013 to call for justice and retribution for Khaled Saeed, the man who was tortured to death in June 2010 and later became one of the symbols of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. She was released in September 2014, only to be sentenced on a different charge, in May 2015, when under the Morsi presidency, El-Masry and a group of lawyers started a sit-in in front of El-Raml police station in Alexandria, demanding an official apology from the Ministry of Interior regarding the injury of their fellow lawyer at the hands of police personnel. The lawyers were then arrested and accused of attempting to break into the police station. An acquittal hearing for El-Masry and her colleagues was made in December 2015 but was unsuccessful.

He critically contributed to the development of the city of San Cristóbal during the 20th century. Martín Marciales Moncada was one of the few financially successful Venezuelan entrepreneurs who was never involved in politics. President Velásquez referred to him as a “rarely seen prophet in his own land.” Historian Luis Hernández Contreras researched Martín Marciales Moncada’s personal and public life and published his biography in a three-volume tome entitled \"Martín Marciales, hijo\", which includes a prologue written by former Venezuelan President Ramón J. Velásquez. Martín Marciales Moncada was one of very few recipients of the Order Francisco de Miranda, Knight Grand Cross (1st Class), the highest rank of the order. It was the only time President Velasquez traveled outside of the capital city to grant the National Order to a citizen.\n\nMartín Marciales Jaime, Martín Marciales Moncada’s father, was a revolutionary in favor of Juan Pablo Peñaloza, the opposition leader to both Cipriano Castro and Juan Vicente Gómez. The opposition were then called “Yellow Liberals.” Martin Marciales Jaime was a carpenter who hid weapons in secret compartments in the furniture he made. The weapons were intended to arm the forces of the so-called “Yellow Revolutionaries” who hoped to oust then dictator Juan Vicente Gómez from power.\n\nWhen Martín Marciales Moncada was eight years old, his father was sent to prison at El Castillo de San Carlos due to his revolutionary activities. The entire family relocated closer to the prison so they could visit and assist Martin Marciales Jaime. At that time, Martín Marciales Moncada started working to help support his family. He and his mother opened a small shop where they sold groceries and basic goods. Martín Marciales Moncada graduated from elementary school, but did not continue his education.\n\nAs a young teenager, Martín Marciales Moncada started working as a traveling merchant. He sold spare parts for vehicles, including tires, as well as other goods. In his early twenties, Martín Marciales Moncada returned to San Cristóbal. There, he bought from his father and began managing a Chevrolet car dealership.\n\nDuring this time, the Germans dominated most of local commerce in the area using their own monetary system; they paid local farmers with custom-made tokens, which could only be used in German-owned shops and businesses. As such, there was no real local currency in circulation. Martín Marciales Moncada played major role in disentangling the local economy from the German influenced system of tokens.\n\nLater, at the age of 28, Martín Marciales Moncada began directly importing General Motors vehicles to San Cristóbal, and was one of two major importers of GM vehicles in the country. This business effort allowed Martín Marciales Moncada to develop enough financial power to contribute significantly to the city’s development. Martín Marciales Moncada’s biographer, Luis Hernández Contreras, described these efforts as Martín Marciales Moncada’s “own diverse ways of being useful.”\n\nOn April 7, 1945, Martín Marciales Moncada married Marina González Romero. The couple had four children: Marcial, Mariana, Mariela, and Mario. Marina still resides in San Cristóbal and is a renowned philanthropist and artist.\n\nMartín Marciales Moncada either founded or co-founded the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was a founding member of the Rotary Club.

Many local people reported occasions in which he personally saved their lives as a volunteer firefighter.\n\nMartín Marciales Moncada used raffle proceeds to help rebuild the Basilica of Our Lady of Consolation, Táriba. He contributed to the raffle by donating two houses, three cars, and ninety sewing machines, which were used as raffle prizes. All proceeds went directly to the Basilica.

MacDonald novel \"The Executioners\". He was portrayed by Robert Mitchum in \"Cape Fear\" and Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese's remake.\n\nIn both film versions of MacDonald's novel, Cady is a criminal with an obsessive grudge against an attorney named Sam Bowden (played by Gregory Peck in the first film and by Nick Nolte in the remake) who sent him to prison for rape. While in prison, Cady teaches himself to read as he nurtures his hatred of Bowden, made especially intense when his wife divorces him and takes their child. Upon his release, he terrorizes Bowden and his family, stalking his wife at their house and attempting to seduce Bowden's teenaged daughter. After Bowden's failed attempts to get rid of Cady with bribery and a restraining order, he hires street thugs to rough Cady up, which only succeeds in making him angrier and more determined to make sure Bowden \"learns all about loss\". Cady tracks the family to its summer home in the titular North Carolina beach town of Cape Fear and nearly kills them all. In the climax of the first film, Bowden puts Cady under citizen's arrest; in the second, Cady apparently drowns after a fight with Bowden.\n\nSignificant differences are seen between the way in which Cady is portrayed in the original film and the remake. Mitchum's characterization is that of a sleazy, degenerate con artist, while De Niro's is of a homicidal sociopath, who viciously attacks everything and everyone Bowden holds dear (he even beats and rapes one of Bowden's colleagues). The remake also sheds some light on Cady's background, revealing he grew up in a rural Pentecostal family who handled snakes and drank strychnine to achieve religious ecstasy. \n\nAlso, many differences occur in the films' portrayals of Cady and Bowden's relationship. In the first film, Bowden merely testified against Cady in court. In the remake, Bowden was Cady's attorney who deliberately suppressed evidence which may have lightened Cady's sentence or granted him an acquittal. Most notably, Cady's fate differs in the two films. In the 1962 version, Bowden manages to grab his revolver and shoot Cady in the leg during a fight between the two men. Rather than finish him off, Bowden spares Cady so he will be forced to spend the rest of his life in jail.\nIn the remake, Bowden is able to handcuff Cady's ankle to a railing in the houseboat before it hits submerged rocks and begins to break apart. The two exchange blows with rocks, and Bowden savagely attempts to bring a large rock down on Cady's head. Before he can do so, though, Cady is washed out into the river, still cuffed to part of the houseboat, madly crying out and speaking in tongues, and Bowden then watches as Cady is pulled to the bottom of the river and drowns.\n\nIn the novel by John D. MacDonald, Sam testified against Max back in World War II, since he witnessed the latter raping a fourteen-year-old girl when he was stationed in Australia. Max was sentenced to life at a hard labor prison camp but was released thirteen years later. Max nurtured his grudge against Sam during his time which exacerbated due to his wife divorcing him and his only son dying in an accident. Unlike the films, Max refers to Sam as \"lieutenant\" instead of \"counselor\".\n\nMax's background differs from the films in that he hails from West Virginia and has three brothers, all of whom were criminals (with one killed during a prison riot). They are not religious zealots like in the 1991 film. However, in the book, Max is very much a violent psychopath who has no remorse for anything he does which includes, among many other despicable acts, shooting one of Sam's children with a rifle. He is determined to kill Sam \"six times\". \n\nCady's fate in the book is being shot by Sam as he flees from their home after attacking Sam's wife. In the wee hours of the morning during a police search, his body is found in the woods behind the Bowden home. He died of excessive blood loss from two of Sam's shots.\n\n\n"}

Wark is known for their writings on media theory, critical theory, new media, and the Situationist International. Their best known works are \"A Hacker Manifesto\" and \"Gamer Theory\". They are Professor of Media and Cultural Studies at The New School in New York City.\n\nTheir preferred pronouns are they/them/their.\n\nKenneth McKenzie Wark was born in Newcastle, Australia in 1961 and grew up with their older brother Robert and sister Susan. McKenzie's mother died when they were 6 years old. Brother Robert McKenzie Wark remembers reading to them as a young child and the three children were brought up by their architect father Ross Kenneth Wark. McKenzie received a bachelor's degree from Macquarie University, a Master's from the University of Technology, Sydney and they received a PhD in Communications from Murdoch University. Wark is married to Christen Clifford. They have two children, Felix and Vera.\n\nIn \"Virtual Geography\", published in 1994, Wark offered a theory of what they called the 'weird global media event'. Examples given in the book include the stock market crash of 1987, the Tiananmen square demonstrations of 1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. They argued that the emergence of a global media space – a virtual geography – made out of increasingly pervasive lines of communication – vectors – was emerging as a more chaotic space than globalisation theory usually maintains.\n\nMuch of Wark's early engagement in public debate occurred in the Australian post-marxist quarterly \"Arena\", through a number of articles and exchanges about the character of real abstraction, the meta-ideological character of post-structuralism, and the consequences of these issues for emancipatory social theory.\n\nIn two subsequent books, \"The Virtual Republic\", published in 1997, and \"Celebrities, Culture and Cyberspace\" (1999), Wark turned their attention to the national cultural space of their homeland, Australia. The first of these works examined the so-called 'culture wars' of the 1990s as symptomatic of struggles over the redefinition of Australian national identity and culture in an age of global media. The second of these 'Australian' books looked at the transformation of a social democratic idea of the 'popular' as a political idea into a more market-based and media-driven popular culture.\n\nBoth these studies grew out of Wark's experience as a public intellectual who participated in public controversies, mainly through his newspaper column in \"The Australian\", a leading national daily. They developed an approach based on participant observation, but adapted to the media sphere.\n\nWark described the process of culture by which \"the jolt of new experiences becomes naturalised into habit\" or second nature and describes the information society as not being new but something that changes through culture the balance between space binding and time binding media.\n\nThey further describe the concept of \"third nature\" or telesthesia, where devices such as television and the telephone creates a platform which we use to communicate to people over large distances and not just a machine that we learn to operate individually. This is described in his book \"The Virtual Republic\":\nWhile it may feel natural for some to inhabit this media-made world, I suspect there is a fundamental change here that has a lot of people just a bit spooked. It's no longer a case of making second nature out of nature, of building things and getting used to living in the world people build. I think it might be interesting to consider telesthesia to be something fundamentally different. What gets woven out of telegraph, telephone, television, telecommunications is not a second nature but what I call third nature.\n\nWark emigrated to the United States in 2000. With the Australian poet John Kinsella, Australian novelist Bernard Cohen and Australian memoirist Terri-Ann White, Wark co-wrote \"Speed Factory\", an experimental work about distance and expatriation. The co-authors developed for this the speed factory writing technique, in which an author writes 300 words, emails it to the next author, who then has 24 hours to write the next 300 words.\n\n\"Dispositions\", another experimental work followed. Wark travelled the world with a GPS device and recorded observations at particular times and coordinates. The media theorist Ned Rossiter has called this approach a 'micro-empiricism', and sees it as derived from the work of the philosopher Gilles Deleuze.\n\nIn 2004 Wark published their best known work, \"A Hacker Manifesto\". Here Wark argues that the rise of intellectual property creates a new class division, between those who produce it, whom they calls the hacker class, and those who come to own it, the vectoralist class. Wark argues that these vectoralists have imposed the concept of property on all physical fields (thus having scarcity), but now the new vectoralists lay claim to intellectual property, a field that is not bound by scarcity. By the concept of intellectual property these vectoralists attempt to institute an imposed scarcity in an immaterial field. Wark argues that the vectoral class cannot control the intellectual (property) world itself, but only in its commodified form—not its overall application or use.\n\n\"Gamer Theory\" combined Wark's interest in experimental writing techniques in networked media with their own developing media theory. \"Gamer Theory\" was first published by the Institute for the Future of the Book as a networked book with his own specially designed interface. In \"Gamer Theory\" Wark argues that in a world that is increasingly competitive and game-like, computer games are a utopian version of the world (itself an imperfect game), because they actually realise the principles of the level playing field and reward based on merit that is elsewhere promised but not actually delivered.\n\nWark's recent work explores the art, writing, and politics of the Situationist International (SI). In their book \"50 Years of Recuperation of the Situationist International\" (the result of a lecture given at Columbia University), Wark examines the influences of Situationist aesthetics on contemporary art and activist movements, from tactical media to the anti-globalism movement. Wark pays particular attention to often-neglected figures and works in the SI, including the utopian architectural projects of Constant, the painting of Giuseppe Pinot, The Situationist Times of Jacqueline de Jong and the novels of Michèle Bernstein.\n\nIn 2013 Wark, along with Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker, published the book \"Excommunication: Three Inquiries in Media and Mediation\". In the opening of the book the authors ask \"Does everything that exists, exist to me presented and represented, to be mediated and remediated, to be communicated and translated? There are mediative situations in which heresy, exile, or banishment carry the day, not repetition, communion, or integration. There are certain kinds of messages that state 'there will be no more messages'. Hence for every communication there is a correlative excommunication.\" This approach has been referred to as the \"New York School of Media Theory.\"\n\nAt The New School, Professor Wark teaches seminars on the Situationist International, the Militarized Vision lecture, as well as Introduction to Cultural Studies. Wark was an Eyebeam resident in 2007.\n\nAt the theoretical level, Wark's writing can be seen in the context of three currents: British Cultural Studies, German Critical Theory and French Poststructuralism. Their earlier works combined British and French influences to extend Australian cultural studies to encompass questions of globalisation and new media technology. Their later works draw more from Critical Theory and much revised Marxism. Through their experimentation with new media forms, starting with listservers such as nettime.org and later with web interfaces such as the one developed for Gamer Theory, their works intersect with other new media theorists such as Geert Lovink and Mark Amerika.\n\n\n\n"}

He also began what would become a long career as a freelance writer and columnist; he started as a reporter for the \"Vernon Daily Record\" before he moved on to the \"Times Record News\" in Wichita Falls.\n\nAs an independent writer, Knox sold several articles to gun magazines including \"Guns & Ammo\" and \"Guns\" magazine between 1964 and 1966. He formally entered the firearms journalism trade in 1966, when he became the founding editor of \"Gun Week\", a weekly newspaper covering firearms issues of the day. The paper gave in-depth coverage to the bill that would eventually become the Gun Control Act of 1968. Knox left \"Gun Week\" in 1968, when he moved to Wolfe Publishing/as editor of \"Handloader Magazine\" and founding editor of \"Rifle Magazine\".\n\nIn 1978, Knox moved to Washington, D.C. in order to lobby against gun control measures and work for the National Rifle Association. He served four years as the executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA), the lobbying arm of the NRA. At the ILA, Knox was instrumental in convincing friendly lawmakers to introduce a reform of the 1968 Act. The bill became the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which eventually passed in 1986.\n\nFrom 1984 to his death, Knox was the chairman of the Firearms Coalition, an organization that he created, which lobbies against restrictive gun laws.\n\nOne of the recurring themes throughout Knox's career was his uncompromising stance on gun laws and the 2nd Amendment, which he believed recognizes a pre-existing human right to self-defense. His views would lead him into many confrontations with other members of the NRA leadership and Congressional leadership. Knox publicly accused many NRA leaders of being too moderate. In 1977, Knox was among the hardliners who took control of the NRA.\n\nThe same hardliners fired Knox from the NRA five years later in 1982. Over the ensuing decade, Knox used his own columns in magazines popular with NRA members like \"Shotgun News\" and \"Guns & Ammo\" to get himself and up to 10 allies elected to the NRA board in 1991.\n\nIn 1997, a narrowly-divided NRA Board voted Knox out of the succession line for President of the NRA replacing him with Charlton Heston, who was subsequently elected president of the organization.\n\nKnox died in 2005, aged 69, after a year-long struggle with colon cancer.\n\nHis son, Jeff Knox, continues the \"Knox Report\" column which is published in \"Shotgun News\" and elsewhere. Another son, Chris Knox has compiled and edited a collection of his writing, \"Neal Knox: The Gun Rights War\"\n\n"}

She was first mentored by the renowned conservationist Richard Leakey. She was granted a Government of Kenya Scholarship to study Ecology and Biology at University of Bristol. She then received her Master's degree in at University of Florida in Wildlife and Range Science in 1992. Her early studies and fieldwork centered on primates, writing her Masters thesis on the monkeys of the Tana River Primate National Reserve.\n\nBetween undergraduate and graduate school, Kahumbu returned to Kenya to work for the Kenya Wildlife Service. There, she was charged with counting and measuring the ivory stockpile in the country's vaults in preparation for Richard Leakey's now-famous internationally televised burning of the tusks. The event changed her focus from primates to elephants of her doctoral work. She was granted a Petri scholarship to attend Princeton University to complete her PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from 1994 – 2002, where she studied elephants in the Shimba Hills on the Kenyan coast. In 2005, she received her Certificate in the Program for Management Development through the Gordon Institute of Business Sciences at University of Pretoria.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD, Kahumbu returned to the Kenya Wildlife Service and led the Kenyan delegation to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. In 2007, Kahumbu became the executive director of WildlifeDirect, a nonprofit organization co-founded in 2004 by her mentor Richard Leakey as an online platform to provide voice to African conservationists. The organization has since become the largest wildlife blogging site in Africa and has covered a diverse array of conservation issues—from protecting chimpanzees in Sierra Leone to wild dogs in Zimbabwe. Those who are inspired by the blog posts can then donate directly to the conservationists on the ground, circumventing administrative fees.\n\nThe \"Hands Off Our Elephants\" campaign launched by Kahumbu at WildlifeDirect to put an end to the poaching of elephants and trafficking of ivory, and has since gained the support of Kenyan First Lady Margaret Kenyatta. The campaign aims to leverage media to drive behavior change and to foster agency within the local community to take action. In tandem, the campaign has worked to propose concrete legislation to enforce against the illegal ivory trade. When the campaign began in 2014, more than 100,000 elephants across the African continent had been killed for their ivory over three years.\n\nKahumbu also teaches conservation to students as a lecturer at Princeton University, where she leads an undergraduate course in community conservation during an annual field course in Kenya.\n\nKahumbu has reached the public through a variety of mediums to advocate for conversation—from television to editorials to museums. She is the producer of NTV Wild, an award-winning wildlife documentary series, and NTV Wild Talk, a television shows hosted by Smriti Vidyarthi that covers conservation issues. She has also contributed regularly to The Guardian, advocating for protection for elephants through a solutions-based approach—from ending corruption to inspiring a young generation of conservationist—and denouncing the ivory trade. Kahumbu is also a Chairperson for National Museums of Kenya.\n\nKahumbu is also an accomplished children's book writer, co-authoring global best sellers like \"Owen and Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship\", based on the unlikely friendship of hippopotamus and an Aldabra giant tortoise Owen and Mzee.\n\n"}

O'Barry transitioned from training dolphins to instead advocating against industries that keep dolphins in captivity, after one of the \"Flipper\" dolphins died in his arms.\n\nIn 1970, O'Barry founded the Dolphin Project, a group that aims to educate the public about captivity and, where feasible, free captive dolphins. He was featured in the Academy Award-winning film \"The Cove\" (2009), which used covert techniques to expose the yearly dolphin drive hunting that goes on in Taiji, Japan.\n\nRichard O'Barry started out capturing and training dolphins for the Miami Seaquarium and through the 1960s became the head trainer for the five dolphins who collectively played Flipper on the popular American TV show, while also serving as stunt double for show cast member Luke Halpin. When, in early 1970, a few years after production of Flipper had ended, Kathy, the dolphin who most often played Flipper, did not resurface for air, O'Barry considered the possibility that she had committed suicide, and concluded that capturing, displaying and training dolphins to perform tricks is wrong.\n\nOn Earth Day in 1970 he founded Dolphin Project, an organization dedicated to educating the public about the plight of dolphins in captivity. He also pioneered work to demonstrate rehabilitation and release as a viable alternative for captive dolphins.

He had English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, German, and French ancestry.\n\nWhile his mother was a practitioner of Christian Science, Williams was raised in the Episcopal Church his father belonged to. Williams wrote a list: \"Top Ten Reasons to Be an Episcopalian\". During a television interview on \"Inside the Actors Studio\" in 2001, Williams credited his mother as an important early influence on his humor, and he tried to make her laugh to gain attention.\n\nWilliams attended public elementary school in Lake Forest at Gorton Elementary School (now Gorton Community Center) and middle school at Deer Path Junior High School (now Deer Path Middle School). He described himself as a quiet child who did not overcome his shyness until he became involved with his high school drama department. His friends recall him as very funny.\n\nIn late 1963, when Williams was 12, his father was transferred to Detroit. The family lived in a 40-room farmhouse on 20 acres in suburban Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he was a student at the private Detroit Country Day School. He excelled in school, where he was on the school's soccer team and wrestling team, and was elected class president.\n\nAs both his parents worked, Williams was attended to by the family's maid, who was his main companion. When Williams was 16, his father took early retirement and the family moved to Marin County, Tiburon, California. Following their move, Williams attended Redwood High School in nearby Larkspur. At the time of his graduation in 1969, he was voted \"Most Likely Not to Succeed\" and \"Funniest\" by his classmates.\n\nAfter high school graduation, Williams enrolled at Claremont Men's College in Claremont, California, to study political science; he dropped out to pursue acting. Williams studied theatre for three years at the College of Marin, a community college in Kentfield, California. According to College of Marin's drama professor James Dunn, the depth of the young actor's talent became evident when he was cast in the musical \"Oliver!\" as Fagin. Williams often improvised during his time in the drama program, leaving cast members in hysterics. Dunn called his wife after one late rehearsal to tell her that Williams \"was going to be something special\".\n\nIn 1973, Williams attained a full scholarship to the Juilliard School (Group 6, 1973–1976) in New York City. He was one of 20 students accepted into the freshman class and one of two accepted by John Houseman into the Advanced Program at the school that year; the other was Christopher Reeve. William Hurt and Mandy Patinkin were also classmates. According to biographer Jean Dorsinville, Franklyn Seales and Williams were roommates at Juilliard. Reeve remembered his first impression of Williams when they were new students at Juilliard:\n\nWilliams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, who Reeve said was one of the world's leading voice and speech teachers. According to Reeve, Skinner was bewildered by Williams, who could instantly perform in many accents, including Scottish, Irish, English, Russian, and Italian. Their primary acting teacher was Michael Kahn, who was \"equally baffled by this human dynamo\". Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Williams silenced his critics with his convincing role of an old man in \"The Night of the Iguana,\" by Tennessee Williams. \"He simply \"was\" the old man,\" wrote Reeve. \"I was astonished by his work and very grateful that fate had thrown us together.\"\n\nWilliams and Reeve remained close friends until Reeve's death in 2004. Reeve had struggled for years with being quadriplegic after a horse-riding accident. Their friendship was like \"brothers from another mother\" according to his son Zak Williams. Williams paid many of Reeve's medical bills and gave financial support to his family.\n\nDuring the summers of 1974, 1975 and 1976, Williams worked as a busser at The Trident in Sausalito, California. He left Juilliard during his junior year in 1976 at the suggestion of Houseman, who said there was nothing more Juilliard could teach him. Gerald Freedman, another of his teachers at Juilliard, said that Williams was a \"genius\" and that the school's conservative and classical style of training did not suit him; no one was surprised that he left.\n\nAfter his family moved to Marin County, Williams began performing stand-up comedy in the San Francisco Bay Area in the mid-1970s. He gave his first performance at the Holy City Zoo, a comedy club in San Francisco, where he worked his way up from tending bar. In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a rock music renaissance, hippies, drugs, and a sexual revolution, and in the 1970s, Williams helped lead its \"comedy renaissance\", writes critic Gerald Nachman. Williams says he found out about \"drugs and happiness\" during that period, adding that he saw \"the best brains of my time turned to mud\".\n\nWilliams moved to Los Angeles and continued performing stand-up at clubs including the Comedy Club. There, in 1977, he was seen by TV producer George Schlatter, who asked him to appear on a revival of his \"Laugh-In\" show. The show aired in late 1977 and was his debut TV appearance. That year, Williams also performed a show at the LA Improv for Home Box Office. While the \"Laugh-In\" revival failed, it led Williams into a television career; he continued performing stand-up at comedy clubs such as the Roxy to help keep his improvisational skills sharp.\n\nWilliams won a Grammy Award for the recording of his 1979 live show at the Copacabana in New York, \"Reality...What a Concept\". Some of his later tours, after he became a TV and film star, include \"An Evening With Robin Williams\" (1982–83), \"Robin Williams: At The Met\" (1986) and \"Robin Williams: Live on Broadway\" (2002). The latter broke many long-held records for a comedy show. In some cases, tickets sold out within thirty minutes. In 1986, Williams released \"A Night at the Met\".\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, in August 2008, Williams announced a new 26-city tour, \"Weapons of Self-Destruction\". He said that this was his last chance to make jokes at the expense of the Bush administration, but by the time the show was staged, only a few minutes covered that subject. The tour started at the end of September 2009 and concluded in New York on December 3, and was the subject of an HBO special on December 8, 2009.\n\nWilliams said that partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he started using drugs and alcohol early in his career. He further said that he never drank nor took drugs while on stage but occasionally performed when hung over from the previous day. During the period he was using cocaine, he said that it made him paranoid when performing on stage.\n\nWilliams once described the life of stand-up comedians:\nSome, such as the critic Vincent Canby, were concerned that his monologues were so intense that it seemed as though at any minute his \"creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown.\" His biographer Emily Herbert described his \"intense, utterly manic style of stand-up [which sometimes] defies analysis ... [going] beyond energetic, beyond frenetic ... [and sometimes] dangerous ... because of what it said about the creator's own mental state.\"\n\nWilliams felt secure he would not run out of ideas, as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied. He also explained that he often used free association of ideas while improvising in order to keep the audience interested. The competitive atmosphere caused problems; for example, some comedians accused him of copying their jokes, which Williams strongly denied. David Brenner claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes. Whoopi Goldberg defended him, explaining that it is difficult for comedians not to reuse another comedian's material, and that it is done \"all the time\". He later avoided going to performances of other comedians to deter similar accusations.\n\nDuring a \"Playboy\" interview in 1992, Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, \"There's that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off or talk about things, if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something ... If I stop trying, I get afraid.\" While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosiński to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.\n\nAfter the \"Laugh-In\" revival and appearing in the cast of \"The Richard Pryor Show\" on NBC, Williams was cast by Garry Marshall as the alien Mork in a 1978 episode of the TV series \"Happy Days\", \"My Favorite Orkan\". Sought after as a last minute cast replacement for a departing actor, Williams impressed the producer with his quirky sense of humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition. As Mork, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice. The cast and crew, as well as TV network executives were deeply impressed at his performance.\n\nMork's appearance proved so popular with viewers that it led to the spin-off television sitcom \"Mork & Mindy\", which co-starred Pam Dawber, and ran from 1978 to 1982; the show was written to accommodate his extreme improvisations in dialog and behavior. Although he portrayed the same character as in \"Happy Days\", the series was set in the present in Boulder, Colorado, instead of the late 1950s in Milwaukee. \"Mork & Mindy\" at its peak had a weekly audience of 60 million and was credited with turning Williams into a \"superstar.\" According to critic James Poniewozik, the series was especially popular among young people as Williams became a \"man and a child, buoyant, rubber-faced, an endless gusher of invention.\"\n\nMork became popular, featured on posters, coloring books, lunch-boxes, and other merchandise. \"Mork & Mindy\" was such a success in its first season that Williams appeared on the March 12, 1979, cover of \"Time\" magazine. The cover photo, taken by Michael Dressler in 1979, is said to have \"[captured] his different sides: the funnyman mugging for the camera, and a sweet, more thoughtful pose that appears on a small TV he holds in his hands\" according to Mary Forgione of the \"Los Angeles Times\". This photo was installed in the National Portrait Gallery in the Smithsonian Institution shortly after his death to allow visitors to pay their respects. Williams also appeared on the cover of the August 23, 1979, issue of \"Rolling Stone\", photographed by Richard Avedon.\n\nStarting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, including three HBO comedy specials, \"Off The Wall\" (1978), \"An Evening with Robin Williams\" (1983) and \"Robin Williams: Live at the Met\" (1986). Also in 1986, Williams co-hosted the 58th Academy Awards.\n\nWilliams was also a regular guest on various talk shows, including \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and \"Late Night with David Letterman\", on which he appeared 50 times. Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at The Comedy Store in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up. \"He came in like a hurricane,\" said Letterman, who said he then thought to himself, \"Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business.\"\n\nHis stand-up work was a consistent thread through his career, as seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD) \"Robin Williams: Live on Broadway\" (2002). He was voted 13th on Comedy Central's list \"100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time\" in 2004.\n\nWilliams and Billy Crystal were in an unscripted cameo at the beginning of an episode of the third season of \"Friends\". His many TV appearances included an episode of \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\", and he starred in an episode of \"\". In 2010, he appeared in a sketch with Robert De Niro on \"Saturday Night Live\", and in 2012, guest-starred as himself in two FX series, \"Louie\" and \"Wilfred\". In May 2013, CBS started a new series, \"The Crazy Ones\", starring Williams, but the show was canceled after one season.\n\nThe first film role credited to Robin Williams is a small part in the 1977 low-budget comedy \"Can I Do It... 'Til I Need Glasses?\". His first major performance is as the title character in \"Popeye\" (1980). There, Williams showcased the acting skills previously demonstrated in his television work; and the film's commercial disappointment was not blamed upon his role. He stars as the leading character in \"The World According to Garp\" (1982), which Williams considered \"may have lacked a certain madness onscreen, but it had a great core\". He continued with other smaller roles in less successful films, such as \"The Survivors\" (1983) and \"Club Paradise\" (1986), though he said these roles did not help advance his film career.\n\nHis first major break came from his starring role in director Barry Levinson's \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" (1987), which earned Williams a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film is set in 1965 during the Vietnam War, with Williams playing the role of Adrian Cronauer, a radio shock jock who keeps the troops entertained with comedy and sarcasm. Williams was allowed to play the role without a script, improvising most of his lines. Over the microphone, he created voice impressions of people, including Walter Cronkite, Gomer Pyle, Elvis Presley, Mr. Ed, and Richard Nixon. \"We just let the cameras roll,\" said producer Mark Johnson, and Williams \"managed to create something new for every single take.\"\nMany of his later roles were in comedies tinged with pathos. His roles in comedy and dramatic films garnered Williams an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (for his role as a psychologist in \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997)), as well as two previous Academy Award nominations (for playing an English teacher in \"Dead Poets Society\" (1989), and for playing a troubled homeless man in \"The Fisher King\" (1991)). In 1991, he played an adult Peter Pan in the film \"Hook\", although he had said that he would have to lose twenty-five pounds.\n\nOther roles Williams had in acclaimed dramatic films include \"Moscow on the Hudson\" (1984), \"Awakenings\" (1990), \"What Dreams May Come\" (1998), and \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999). In \"Insomnia\", Williams portrayed a writer / killer on the run from a sleep-deprived Los Angeles policeman (played by Al Pacino) in rural Alaska. Also in 2002, in the psychological thriller \"One Hour Photo\", Williams played an emotionally disturbed photo development technician who becomes obsessed with a family for whom he has developed pictures for a long time. The last Williams movie released during his lifetime was \"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn\", a film addressing the value of life. In it, Williams played Henry Altmann, a terminally ill man who reassesses his life and works to redeem himself.\n\nAmong the actors who helped him during his acting career, he credited Robert De Niro, from whom he learned the power of silence and economy of dialog when acting, to portray the deep-driven man. From Dustin Hoffman, with whom he co-starred in \"Hook\", he learned to take on totally different character types, and to transform his characters by extreme preparation. Mike Medavoy, producer of \"Hook\", told its director, Steven Spielberg, that he intentionally teamed up Hoffman and Williams for the film because he knew they wanted to work together, and that Williams welcomed the opportunity of working with Spielberg. Williams benefited from working with Woody Allen, who directed him and Billy Crystal in \"Deconstructing Harry\" (1997), as Allen had knowledge of the fact that Crystal and Williams had often performed together on stage.\n\nHis performance in the role of a therapist in \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997) influenced some real therapists and won Williams an Academy Award. In \"Awakenings\" (1990), Williams played a doctor modeled on Oliver Sacks, who wrote the book on which the film was based. Sacks later said the way the actor's mind worked was a \"form of genius.\" In 1989 Williams played a private school teacher in \"Dead Poets Society\", which included a final, emotional scene which some critics said \"inspired a generation\" and became a part of pop culture. Looking over most of his filmography, one writer was \"struck by the breadth\" and radical diversity of most roles Williams portrayed.\n\nTerry Gilliam, who co-founded \"Monty Python\" and directed Williams in two of his films, \"The Fisher King\" and \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" (1988), said in 1992 that Williams had the ability to \"go from manic to mad to tender and vulnerable ... [Williams had] the most unique mind on the planet. There's nobody like him out there.\"\nWilliams voiced characters in several animated films. His voice role as the Genie in the animated musical \"Aladdin\" (1992) was written for him. The film's directors stated that they took a risk by writing the role. At first, Williams refused the role since it was a Disney movie, and he did not want the studio profiting by selling merchandise based on the movie. He accepted the role with certain conditions: \"I'm doing it basically because I want to be part of this animation tradition. I want something for my children. One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything—as in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff.\" Williams improvised much of his dialogue, recording approximately 30 hours of tape, and impersonated dozens of celebrities, including Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F. Buckley, Peter Lorre, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arsenio Hall. His role in \"Aladdin\" became one of his most recognized and best-loved, and the film was the highest-grossing of 1992; it won numerous awards, including a Golden Globe for Williams. His performance led the way for other animated films to incorporate actors with more star power. He was named a Disney Legend in 2009.\n\nWilliams continued to provide voices in other animated films, including \"\" (1992), \"Robots\" (2005), \"Happy Feet\" (2006), and an uncredited vocal performance in \"Everyone's Hero\" (2006). He also voiced the holographic Dr. Know character in the live-action film \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" (2001). He was the voice of The Timekeeper, a former attraction at the Walt Disney World Resort about a time-traveling robot who encounters Jules Verne and brings him to the future.\n\nIn 2006, he starred in \"The Night Listener\", a thriller about a radio show host who realizes that a child with whom he has developed a friendship may or may not exist; that year, he starred in five movies, including \"Man of the Year\", was the Surprise Guest at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards and appeared on an episode of \"\" that aired on January 30, 2006.\n\nAt the time of his death in 2014, Williams had appeared in four movies not yet released: \"\", \"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\", \"Boulevard\" and \"Absolutely Anything\".\n\nWilliams appeared opposite Steve Martin at Lincoln Center in an off-Broadway production of \"Waiting for Godot\" in 1988. He made his Broadway acting debut in Rajiv Joseph's \"Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo\", which opened at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on March 31, 2011. He headlined his own one-man show, \"Robin Williams: Live on Broadway\", that played at the Broadway theatre in July 2002.\n\nWilliams hosted a talk show for Audible. The program premiered in April 2000 and was available exclusively from Audible's website.\n\nWilliams married his first wife Valerie Velardi in June 1978, following a live-in relationship with comedian Elayne Boosler. Velardi and Williams met in 1976 while he was working as a bartender at a tavern in San Francisco. Their son Zachary Pym \"Zak\" Williams was born in 1983. and Velardi divorced him in 1988. While it was reported that Williams began an affair with Zachary's nanny Marsha Garces in 1986, Velardi stated in the 2018 documentary \"\" that the relationship with Garces began after the two had separated.\n\nOn April 30, 1989, he married Garces, who was pregnant with his child. They had two children, Zelda Rae Williams (born 1989) and Cody Alan Williams (born 1991). In March 2008, Garces filed for divorce from Williams, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in 2010. Williams married his third wife, graphic designer Susan Schneider, on October 22, 2011, in St. Helena, California. The two lived at their house in Sea Cliff, San Francisco, California.\n\nWilliams stated, \"My children give me a great sense of wonder. Just to see them develop into these extraordinary human beings.\"\n\nWilliams was a member of the Episcopal Church. He described his denomination in a comedy routine as \"I have that idea of Chicago protestant, Episcopal—Catholic light: half the religion, half the guilt.\" He also described himself as an \"honorary Jew,\" and on Israel's 60th Independence Day in 2008, he appeared in Times Square, along with several other celebrities to wish Israel a happy birthday.\n\nWilliams was an enthusiast of both pen-and-paper role-playing games and video games. His daughter Zelda was named after the title character from \"The Legend of Zelda\", a family favorite video game series, and he sometimes performed at consumer entertainment trade shows.\n\nHis favorite books were the \"Foundation\" trilogy by Isaac Asimov, with his favorite book as a child being \"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\", which he later shared with his children.\n\nWilliams became a devoted cycling enthusiast, having taken up the sport partly as a substitute for drugs. Eventually, he accumulated a large bicycle collection of his own and became a fan of professional road cycling, often traveling to racing events, such as the Tour de France. In 2016, his children donated 87 of his bicycles in support of the Challenged Athletes Foundation and Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation.\n\nIn 1986, Williams teamed up with Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Crystal to found Comic Relief USA. This annual HBO television benefit devoted to the homeless has raised $80 million . Bob Zmuda, creator of Comic Relief, explains that Williams felt blessed because he came from a wealthy home, but wanted to do something to help those less fortunate. Williams made benefit appearances to support literacy and women's rights, along with appearing at benefits for veterans. He was a regular on the USO circuit, where he traveled to 13 countries and performed to approximately 100,000 troops. After his death, the USO thanked him \"for all he did for the men and women of our armed forces.\"\n\nWilliams and his second wife Marsha founded a philanthropic organization called the Windfall Foundation to raise money for many charities. In December 1999, he sang in French on the BBC-inspired music video of international celebrities doing a cover of The Rolling Stones single \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\" for the charity Children's Promise.\n\nIn response to the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, he donated all proceeds of his \"Weapons of Self Destruction\" Christchurch performance to help rebuild the New Zealand city. Half the proceeds were donated to the Red Cross and half to the mayoral building fund. Williams performed with the USO for U.S. troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nFor several years, Williams supported St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, Williams had an addiction to cocaine. He was a casual friend of John Belushi, and the sudden death of Belushi in 1982 due to a drug overdose which happened the morning after the two had partied together, along with the birth of his own son Zak, prompted him to quit drugs and alcohol: \"Was it a wake-up call? Oh yeah, on a huge level. The grand jury helped, too.\" Williams later referring to this event said, \"It sobered the shit out of me.\" Williams turned to exercise and cycling to help alleviate his depression shortly after Belushi's death; according to bicycle shop owner Tony Tom, Williams said, \"cycling saved my life.\"\n\nIn 2003, Williams started drinking alcohol again while working on a film in Alaska. In 2006, he checked himself in to a substance-abuse rehabilitation center in Newberg, Oregon, saying he was an alcoholic.\n\nYears afterward, Williams acknowledged his failure to maintain sobriety, but said he never returned to using cocaine, declaring in a 2010 interview:\n\nIn March 2009, he was hospitalized due to heart problems. He postponed his one-man tour for surgery to replace his aortic valve. The surgery was completed on March 13, 2009, at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nIn mid-2014, Williams admitted himself into the Hazelden Foundation Addiction Treatment Center in Center City, Minnesota, for treatment for alcoholism.\n\nHis publicist, Mara Buxbaum, commented that he was suffering from severe depression prior to his death. His wife, Susan Schneider, stated that in the period before his death, Williams had been sober, but was diagnosed with early stage Parkinson's disease, which was information he was \"not yet ready to share publicly.\" An autopsy revealed that Williams had diffuse Lewy body dementia, which had been diagnosed as Parkinson's. This may have contributed to his depression.\n\nIn an essay published in the journal \"Neurology\" two years after his death, Susan Schneider revealed that the pathology of Lewy body disease in Williams was described by several doctors as among the worst pathologies they had seen. She described the early symptoms of his disease as beginning in October 2013. It included a sudden and prolonged spike in fear and anxiety, constipation, urinary difficulty, heartburn, sleeplessness and insomnia, a poor sense of smell, stress, and a slight tremor in his left hand. Eventually, she said, he suffered from paranoia, delusions, severe insomnia, memory loss, and high cortisol levels, indicating stress. According to Schneider, \"Robin was losing his mind and he was aware of it ... He kept saying, 'I just want to reboot my brain.'\"\n\nOn August 11, 2014, Williams committed suicide in his Paradise Cay, California home. His body was cremated at Montes Chapel of the Hills in San Anselmo and his ashes were scattered over San Francisco Bay the day after his death.\n\nThe final autopsy report, released in November 2014, concluded that his death was from \"suicide due to asphyxia\" by hanging (as suspected by the Marin County sheriff's office on August 12). Neither alcohol nor illegal drugs were involved, and prescription drugs present in his body were at \"therapeutic\" levels. The report also noted that Williams had been suffering \"a recent increase in paranoia\". An examination of his brain tissue suggested Williams suffered from \"diffuse Lewy body dementia\". Describing the disease as \"the terrorist inside my husband's brain\", his wife Susan Schneider said, \"however you look at it—the presence of Lewy bodies took his life,\" referring to his previous diagnosis of Parkinson's.\n\nThe Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) clarified the distinction between the term used in the autopsy report, \"diffuse Lewy body dementia\"—which is more commonly called \"diffuse Lewy body disease\" and refers to the underlying disease process—and the umbrella term, \"Lewy body dementia\"—which encompasses both Parkinson's disease dementia (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). According to LBDA spokesperson Dennis Dickson, \"The report confirms he experienced depression, anxiety and paranoia, which may occur in either Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies ... In early PD, Lewy bodies are generally limited in distribution, but in DLB, the Lewy bodies are spread widely throughout the brain, as was the case with Robin Williams.\"\n\nWilliams's death instantly became global news. The entertainment world, friends, and fans responded to his death through social and other media outlets. His wife, Susan Schneider, said: \"I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken.\" His daughter Zelda Williams responded to his death by stating that the \"world is forever a little darker, less colorful and less full of laughter in his absence\". Then-President Barack Obama said of Williams: \"He was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien—but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit.\"\n\nIn honor of his theater work, the lights of Broadway were darkened for the evening of August 14, 2014. That night, the cast of the \"Aladdin\" musical honored Williams by having the audience join them in a sing-along of \"Friend Like Me\", an Oscar-nominated song originally sung by Williams in the 1992 film \"Aladdin\". Fans of Williams created makeshift memorials at his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and at locations from his television and film career, such as the bench in Boston's Public Garden featured in \"Good Will Hunting\"; the Pacific Heights, San Francisco, home used in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\"; the sign for Parrish Shoes in Keene, New Hampshire, where parts of \"Jumanji\" were filmed; and the Boulder, Colorado, home used for \"Mork & Mindy\". Work on a book biography was begun by \"New York Times\" writer David Itzkoff in 2014, and was published in 2018, entitled simply \"Robin\". In addition, a tunnel on Highway 101 north of the Golden Gate Bridge was officially named the \"Robin Williams Tunnel\" on February 29, 2016.\n\nOn television, during the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 25, 2014, Billy Crystal presented a tribute to Williams, referring to him as \"the brightest star in our comedy galaxy\". On September 9, 2014, PBS aired a one-hour special devoted to his career, and on September 27, 2014, dozens of leading stars and celebrities held a tribute in San Francisco to celebrate his life and career.\n\nBritish heavy metal band Iron Maiden dedicated a song titled \"Tears of a Clown\" to Williams on their 2015 album \"The Book of Souls\". The song looks into his depression and suicide, as well as how he attempted to hide his condition from the public.\n\nShortly after his death, Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Disney Junior all aired the original \"Aladdin\" commercial-free over the course of a week, with a dedicated drawing of the genie at the end of each airing before the credits.\n\nTalk show hosts including Conan O'Brien, David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon paid tribute.\n\nIn addition, several fans also paid tribute to Williams on social media with photo and video reenactments of the 1989 film \"Dead Poets Society\"s \"O Captain! My Captain!\" scene.\n\nThe 2017 film \"\" features a tribute to Williams by mentioning his character Alan Parrish and using the piece that Williams used in the first \"Jumanji\" film. On the film's Blu-ray release, there is also a bonus feature in which the cast and crew pay homage to both Williams and the 1995 installment.\n\nIn 2018, HBO produced a documentary about his life and career. Directed by Marina Zenovich, the film, \"\", was also screened at the Sundance Film Festival. That same year, a mural of Robin Williams was created on Market Street, in San Francisco.\nWilliams credited comedians including Jonathan Winters, Peter Sellers, Nichols and May, and Lenny Bruce as influences, admiring their ability to attract a more intellectual audience with a higher level of wit. He also liked Jay Leno for his quickness in ad-libbing comedy routines and Sid Caesar, whose acts he felt were \"precious\".\n\nJonathan Winters was his \"idol\" early in life; Williams, aged eight, first saw him on television and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career. Williams was inspired by Winters' ingenuity, realizing, he said, \"that anything is possible, that anything is funny He gave me the idea that it can be free-form, that you can go in and out of things pretty easily.\"\n\nDuring an interview in London in 2002, Williams told Michael Parkinson that Peter Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in \"Dr. Strangelove\", stating, \"It doesn't get better than that.\" British comedy actors Dudley Moore and Peter Cook were also among his influences, he told Parkinson.\nWilliams was also influenced by Richard Pryor's fearless ability to talk about his personal life on stage, with subjects including his use of drugs and alcohol, and Williams added those kinds of topics during his own performances. By bringing up such personal matters as a form of comedy, he told Parkinson, it was \"cheaper than therapy\" and gave him a way to release his pent-up energy and emotions.\n\nAlthough Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he later became known for acting in film roles of substance and serious drama. He was considered a \"national treasure\" by many in the entertainment industry and by the public.\n\nHis on-stage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression. According to media scholar Derek A. Burrill, because of the openness with which Williams spoke about his own life, \"probably the most important contribution he made to pop culture, across so many different media, was as Robin Williams the person.\"\n\nWilliams created a signature free-form persona in comedy, in a style that was so widely and uniquely identified with him, that new comedians imitated Williams personally. Jim Carrey impersonated his Mork character early in his own career. This high-spirited persona has been generally credited with paving the way for the growing comedy scene which developed in San Francisco. Young comedians felt more liberated on stage by seeing his spontaneously diverse range: \"one moment acting as a bright, mischievous child, then as a wise philosopher or alien from outer space.\" According to Judd Apatow, the eclectic performer's rapid-fire improvisational style was an inspiration as well as an influence for other comedians, but that his talent was so extremely unusual that no one else could possibly attempt to copy it.\n\nHis film performances often influenced other actors, both in and out of the film industry. Director Chris Columbus, who directed Williams in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", says that watching him work \"was a magical and special privilege. His performances were unlike anything any of us had ever seen, they came from some spiritual and otherworldly place.\" Looking over most of his filmography, Alyssa Rosenberg at \"The Washington Post\" was \"struck by the breadth\" and radical diversity of most of his roles, writing that \"Williams helped us grow up.\"\n\nJanet Hirshenson later revealed in an interview that Robin Williams had expressed interest in portraying Rubeus Hagrid in the \"Harry Potter\" films, but was rejected by Chris Columbus due to the \"British-only edict\".\n\nWon:\n\n\n\n"}

He was a founding member of The 13th Floor Elevators and a pioneer of the psychedelic rock genre.\n\nErickson was interested in music from his youth, playing piano from age 5 and taking up guitar at 10. He attended school in Austin and dropped out of Travis High School in 1965, one month before graduating, rather than cut his hair to conform to the school dress code. His first notable group was The Spades, who scored a regional hit with Erickson's \"We Sell Soul\"; the song is included as an unlisted bonus track on Erickson's 1995 \"All That May Do My Rhyme\" CD and was adapted as \"Don't Fall Down\" by the 13th Floor Elevators for their first album. The Spades' original version of \"You're Gonna Miss Me\", later a hit for 13th Floor Elevators, was featured on the compilation album \"The Best of Pebbles Volume 1\".\n\nErickson co-founded the 13th Floor Elevators in late 1965. He and bandmate Tommy Hall were the main songwriters. Early in her career, singer Janis Joplin considered joining the Elevators, but Family Dog's Chet Helms persuaded her to go to San Francisco instead, where she found major fame.\n\nIn 1966 (Erickson was 19 years old) the band released their debut album \"The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators\". The album had the band's only charting single, Erickson's \"You're Gonna Miss Me\". A stinging breakup song, the single remains probably Erickson's best-known work: it was a major hit on local charts in the U.S. southwest, and appeared at lower positions on national singles charts as well. Critic Mark Deming writes that \"If Roky Erickson had vanished from the face of the earth after The 13th Floor Elevators released their epochal debut single, \"You're Gonna Miss Me\", in early 1966, in all likelihood he'd still be regarded as a legend among garage rock fanatics for his primal vocal wailing and feral harmonica work.\"\n\nIn 1967, the band followed up with \"Easter Everywhere\", perhaps the band's most focused effort, featuring \"Slip Inside This House\", and a noted cover of Bob Dylan's \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\".\n\nThe album \"Live\" was put out in 1968 by International Artists. It featured audience applause dubbed over studio recordings of cover versions, alternate takes, and older material, and it had little to no input from the band.\n\n\"Bull of the Woods\", released in 1969, was the 13th Floor Elevators' last released album on which they worked as a group and was largely the work of Stacy Sutherland. Erickson—due to health and legal problems—and Tommy Hall were only involved with a few tracks, including \"Livin' On\" and \"May the Circle Remain Unbroken\".\n\nIn 1968, while performing at HemisFair, Erickson began speaking gibberish. He was soon diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and sent to a Houston psychiatric hospital, where he involuntarily received electroconvulsive therapy.\n\nThe Elevators were vocal proponents of LSD, mescaline, DMT and marijuana use, and were subject to extra attention from law enforcement agencies. In 1969, Erickson was arrested for possession of a single marijuana joint in Austin. Facing a potential ten-year incarceration, Erickson pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid prison. He was first sent to the Austin State Hospital. After several escapes, he was sent to the Rusk State Hospital in Rusk, Texas, where he was subjected to more electroconvulsive therapy and Thorazine treatments, ultimately remaining in custody until 1972. Six tracks from the 1999 Erickson collection \"Never Say Goodbye\" were recorded during his time there.\n\nIn 1974, after having been released from the state hospital, Erickson formed a new band which he called \"Bleib alien,\" \"Bleib\" being an anagram of Bible and/or German for \"stay,\" and \"Alien\" being a pun on the German word \"allein\" (\"alone\") – the phrase in German therefore being \"remain alone.\" His new band exchanged the psychedelic sounds of The 13th Floor Elevators for a more hard rock sound that featured lyrics on old horror film and science fiction themes. \"Two Headed Dog (Red Temple Prayer)\" (produced by The Sir Douglas Quintet's Doug Sahm and inspired by Vladimir Demikhov's 1950s head transplant experiments) was released as a single.\n\nThe new band was renamed Roky Erickson and the Aliens. In 1979, after playing with the Reversible Cords on May Day at Raul's, Erickson recorded 15 new songs with producer Stu Cook, former bass player of Creedence Clearwater Revival. These efforts were released in two \"overlapping\" LPs – \"I Think of Demons\" (CBS UK, 1980) and \"The Evil One\" (415 Records, 1981). Cook played bass on two tracks, \"Sputnik\" and \"Bloody Hammer.\" Roky performed with The Nervebreakers as his backup band at The Palladium in Dallas in July 1979. A recording was issued on the French label New Rose and was recently re-issued elsewhere.\n\nThe Austin-based band the Explosives served as Roky's most frequent back-up band during the early Raul's Club era, between 1978 and the early 1980s. Billed as Roky Erickson and the Explosives, they were regulars at Raul's, the Continental Club, and other Austin venues. It was this incarnation that contributed two live tracks to the first \"Live at Raul's\" LP, released in 1980, with other Raul's top bands: The Skunks, Terminal Mind, The Next, Standing Waves, and The Explosives (without Roky Erickson). The Roky Erickson tracks (\"Red Temple Prayer\" and \"Don't Shake Me Lucifer\") were not included on the initial release for contractual reasons, but were included on a later release.\nIn 1982, Erickson asserted that a Martian had inhabited his body. He came to feel that, due to his being alien, human beings were attacking him psychically. A concerned friend enlisted a Notary Public to witness an official statement by Erickson that he was an alien; he hoped by declaring so publicly he would be in line with any \"international laws\" he might have been breaking. Erickson claimed the attacks then indeed stopped.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Erickson developed a years-long obsession with the mail, often spending hours poring over random junk mail, writing to solicitors and celebrities (dead or living). He was arrested in 1989 on charges of mail theft. Erickson had picked up mail from neighbors who had moved and taped it to the walls of his room. He insisted that he never opened any of the mail, and the charges were ultimately dropped.\n\nSeveral live albums of his older material have been released since then, and in 1990 Sire Records/Warner Bros. Records released a tribute album, \"\", produced by WB executive Bill Bentley. It featured versions of Erickson's songs performed by The Jesus and Mary Chain, R.E.M., ZZ Top, Poi Dog Pondering, Julian Cope, Butthole Surfers, Bongwater, John Wesley Harding, Doug Sahm, and Primal Scream, among others. According to the liner notes, the title of the album came from a remark Erickson made to a friend who asked him to define psychedelic music, to which Erickson reportedly replied \"It's where the pyramid meets the eye, man,\" an apparent reference to the Eye of Providence and the Great Seal of the United States.\n\nIn 1995, Erickson released \"All That May Do My Rhyme\" on Butthole Surfers drummer King Coffey's label Trance Syndicate Records. Produced by Texas Tornados bassist Speedy Sparks, Austin recording legend Stuart Sullivan, and Texas Music Office director Casey Monahan, the release coincided with the publication of \"Openers II\", a complete collection of Erickson's lyrics. Published by Henry Rollins's 2.13.61 Publications, it was compiled and edited by Casey Monahan with assistance from Rollins and Erickson's youngest brother Sumner Erickson, a classical tuba player.\n\nSumner was granted legal custody of Roky in 2001, and established a legal trust to aid his brother. As a result, Roky received some of the most effective medical and legal aid of his life, the latter useful in helping sort out the complicated tangle of contracts that had reduced royalty payments to all but nothing for his recorded works. He also started taking medication to control his schizophrenia.\n\nA documentary film on the life of Roky Erickson titled \"You're Gonna Miss Me\" was made by director Keven McAlester and screened at the 2005 SXSW film festival. In September of the same year, Erickson performed his first full-length concert in 20 years at the annual Austin City Limits Music Festival with The Explosives with special guest and longtime associate Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top.\n\nIn the December 30, 2005 issue of the \"Austin Chronicle\", an alternative weekly newspaper in Austin, Texas, Margaret Moser chronicled Erickson's recovery, saying Erickson had weaned himself off his medication, played at 11 gigs in Austin that year, obtained a driver's license, bought a car (a Volvo), and voted.\n\nIn 2007, Erickson played his first ever gigs in New York City at Southpaw in Brooklyn, NY, as well as California's Coachella Festival and made a debut performance in England to a capacity audience at the Royal Festival Hall, London. Roky continued to play in Europe, performing for the first time in Finland at Ruisrock festival. According to the article in \"Helsingin Sanomat\" June 8, 2007, the performance was widely considered the highlight of the festival day.\n\nOn September 8, 2008, Scottish post-rock band Mogwai released the \"Batcat\" EP. Erickson is featured on one of the tracks, \"Devil Rides\". Erickson performed alongside Austin-based indie rock band Okkervil River at the Austin Music Awards in 2008 and then again at the 2009 South by Southwest music festival.\n\nErickson returned to the stage in 2008 to perform songs from the 13th Floor Elevators catalog that had not been performed in decades with fellow Austinites The Black Angels as his backing band. After months of practices and time recording in an Austin studio, they performed a show in Dallas followed by a West Coast tour. The Black Angels played a regular set and then backed Erickson as his rhythm section, playing 13th Floor Elevators songs as well as songs from Erickson's solo albums.\n\nOn April 20, 2010, Erickson released \"True Love Cast Out All Evil\", his first album of new material in 14 years. Okkervil River serves as Erickson's backing band on the album.\n\nIn March 2012 Roky Toured New Zealand and Australia for the first time headlining Golden Plains Sixxx Festival in Meredeth as well as playing soldout side shows in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nOn May 10, 2015, Roky performed with the reunited 13th Floor Elevators at LEVITATION (formerly Austin Psych Fest, the event was renamed \"Levitation\" after the song of the same title). The band consisted of original band members Erickson, Tommy Hall, John Ike Walton, and Ronnie Leatherman, joined by Roky's son Jegar Erickson, and guitarist Fred Mitchim.\n\n\"See 13th Floor Elevators Discography\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a singer, she combined a rare quality of tone with dramatic intensity of expression, which was as remarkable on the concert platform as in opera. Today, she is remembered as the author of the most celebrated erotic novel in the German language.\n\nSchröder was born in Hamburg, the daughter of the actress Sophie Schröder and the tenor Friedrich Schröder.\n\nHer first role was at the age of 15 as Aricia in Schiller's translation of Racine's \"Phèdre\", and in 1821, aged 17, she was received with so much enthusiasm as Pamina in Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\" that her future career in opera was assured.\n\nIn 1823, she married Karl Devrient, becoming known as Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, but separated from him in 1828. Meanwhile, she had maintained her popularity at Dresden and elsewhere. She made her first Paris appearance in 1830, and sang in London in 1833 and 1837.\n\nRichard Wagner, born in 1813, claimed to have seen her as Leonore in \"Fidelio\" when he was 16, but this is almost certainly fanciful. He did hear (and conduct) her in numerous roles after 1834, however, and continued to laud her stage artistry right up until his essay \"On Actors and Singers\" (1872) which is dedicated to her memory. She created several roles for Wagner – Adriano in \"Rienzi\", Senta in \"The Flying Dutchman\" and Venus in \"Tannhäuser\". Had Wagner's political profile not been compromised by his involvement with the Dresden uprising in May 1849, Schröder-Devrient would have created Elsa in \"Lohengrin\" which was advertised in 1849 as a forthcoming production in Dresden.\n\nIn 1847 she married David Oskar von Döring, an officer, but divorced him in 1848. She took part in the Revolution of 1848 and the May Uprising in Dresden and was later imprisoned. In 1850 she married , a wealthy Livonian land owner, who was 14 years her junior. They settled first in Trikāta, Latvia, relocating later to von Bock's ancestral home in Loodi (Kersel) in Estonia. She left her husband in the winter of 1858, planning to move to America; but her health began to deteriorate rapidly.\n\nShe died in Coburg, Germany, on 26 January 1860.\n\nAfter her death, a two-volume work entitled \"\" (Memoirs of a Songstress), purporting to be her erotic memoirs, was published in two instalments in 1868 and 1875. The first volume is a plausible account of her sex life, though various discrepancies with known facts have led many to doubt its complete veracity. The erotic adventures contained in the second volume, however seem to descend into complete sexual fantasy. These include the author indulging in lesbian sadomasochism, group sex, sodomy, bestiality, scatology, necrophilia, prostitution, and vampirism: all before she had reached the age of 27. Whether true or not, this work is Germany's most famous work of erotic literature, many times reprinted, translated into English as \"Pauline the Prima Donna\", into French as \"Les Mémoires d'une chanteuse allemande\" and into several other languages.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On many ships, women (as well as young boys) were prohibited by the ship's contract, which all crew members were required to sign. \n\nBecause of the resistance to allowing women on board, many female pirates did not identify themselves as such. Anne Bonny, for example, dressed and acted as a man while on Captain Calico Jack's ship. She and Mary Read, another female pirate, are often identified as being unique in this regard.\n\nThis article contains a list of female pirates who are recognized by historians, listed in the time period they were active.\n\nDuring the Golden Age of Piracy, many men had to leave home to find employment or set sail for economic reasons. This left women with the responsibilities of taking on traditionally male roles and filling the jobs that were left behind. The need for women to fill these roles led them to be granted rights that had historically been exclusive to men. Women were allowed to trade, own ships, and work as retailers. Often they were innkeepers or ran alehouses. In some seaside towns, laws were even written to allow widows to keep their husbands' responsibilities and property. This was important to local economies, as alehouses and other such establishments were centers of commerce, where pirates would congregate and trade with each other and with the people onshore.\n\nAs heads of these establishments, women had a considerable amount of freedom in business. They boarded and fed pirates, bought illegally pirated goods, acted as pawnbrokers for pirates, and even gave out loans - something many men, let alone women, viewed with great caution in that time period. At times, female business owners would even hide their clients when authorities came looking to arrest them for piracy.\nSome women chose to marry pirates. These men were often very wealthy, but their wives tended not to gain wealth as a result of their marriages, as it was difficult for pirates to send home wages and booty earned overseas. These women's houses and establishments were often used as safe havens for pirates, who were considered enemies of all nations. \n\nWomen sometimes became pirates themselves, though they tended to have to disguise themselves as men in order to do so. Pirates did not allow women onto their ships very often. Many women of the time were unable to perform the physically demanding tasks required of the crew. Additionally, women were often regarded as bad luck among pirates . It was feared that the male members of the crew would argue and fight over the women. On many ships, women (as well as young boys) were prohibited by the ship's contract, which all crew members were required to sign. \n\nBecause of the resistance to allowing women on board, many female pirates did not identify themselves as such. Anne Bonny, for example, dressed and acted as a man while on Captain Calico Jack's ship. She and Mary Read, another female pirate, are often identified as being unique in this regard. However, many women dressed as men during the Golden Age of Piracy, in an effort to take advantage of the many rights, privileges, and freedoms that were exclusive to men.\n\nWhile most fictional and dramatic depictions of pirates have been male, some notable female pirates have been depicted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
