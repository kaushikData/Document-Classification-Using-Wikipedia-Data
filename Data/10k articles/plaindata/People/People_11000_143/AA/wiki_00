In their trials, both claimed Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a key planner of the attacks, would have given statements indicating their innocence. Both asked for the United States to present bin al-Shibh as a witness, and the judge agreed that this was a reasonable request. Although the German Justice Ministry pressed the U.S. to present bin al-Shibh, the United States refused, and Mzoudi was thereby acquitted in February 2004. Some observers believe that he would have been convicted had bin al-Shibh been made available as a witness. Ziad Jarrah's fiancee Aysel Sengün testified at Mzoudi's trial.\n\nIn June 2005, a German federal appeals court upheld the acquittal due to insufficient evidence for retrial.

His work depicts the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, portraits, Egyptian history, and Egyptian pop culture. Throughout the revolution, Ammar Abo Bakr painted amidst resistance from the police force, which would cover his art with white paint as a sign of criminal justice. His work often challenges government regimes or injustices and is most famously found on Mohamed Mahmoud Street. However, it can also be seen in other places in Cairo, Alexandria, Beirut, Brussels, Amsterdam, Berlin, Cologne and Frankfurt. In an interview with Sarah Mousa of Jadaliyya, Abo Bakr said, \"...While we [artists] strongly oppose the military and want to mark that stance, we love the people and would also like to present art to the people... I want to present something of beauty to people who can see it, see that their streets have beautiful murals and feel joy. Abo Bakr currently also works with other artists on murmurous projects within and outside Egypt. \"\n\nAmmar Abo Bakr is a mural artist from Egypt. His works have cased walls in Cairo, Luxor, Alexandria, Beirut, Frankfurt, Berlin, Amsterdam and Brussels.\n\nAmmar Abo Bakr was born on February 14, 1980. He attended Luxor Institute of Fine Arts from 1996 and 2001 where he \"studied painting\". Beginning in 2004, Abo Bakr began researching the Egyptian people, looking for inspiration for his artwork. In addition to creating his own graffiti pieces, he was a professor at the Luxor Institute of Fine Arts where he attended school.\n\nAmmar's work depicts the history of Egypt, Islamic culture, and the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Some of his most well known murals were on Mohamed Mahmoud Street which is close to Tahrir Square where the January 25 revolution occurred. His work is inspired by what is going on in the country at the time and by what society wants. <br> Since his work often goes against the government, it can be dangerous when creating these works or murals. He sometimes has to take time off in a certain location because he knows of many family and friends who have gone to prison.\n\nDuring and shortly after the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, \"Ammar\" was busy putting graffiti on anything he could find. Other artists and activists were also writing on public spaces, so not only were they sending messages to the government, but they also were keeping up a dialogue among themselves and responding to other artists' graffiti work. His work on Mohamed Mahmoud Street was especially important because this street connects Tahrir Square and the Ministry of the Interior. The graffiti on this street served as a \"newspaper\" of what was happening during the revolution. When writing about his work, Abo Bakr noted, \"What we did in Egypt in recent years was not about presenting art, at least it wasn't to me: We used walls as a newspaper... Me, I was a fine arts assistant professor. I left the faculty of arts to report on the revolution in the city’s walls.\"\n\nIn 2012, Ammar, along with other artists started the \"No Walls\" campaign. This campaign was aiming to cover with graffiti all of the concrete barricades that had been put up by the government. The government put barricades up in neighborhoods, which were not only a visual sign of oppression but also inconvenienced the community members because they had to navigate through the barricades. Along with famous artists, many community members helped paint the walls. There were intricate murals or simple paintings of the continuation of the street behind the barricades. The goal of the campaign was to use trompe l’oeil to artistically transform the restrictive barriers put in place by Egypt's Interior Ministry, in order to make it appear as if they were not there.\n\nAmmar is strongly connected with everyday Egyptian people. He credits them for giving him his inspiration and creativity. He also believes that the art in Luxor and Cairo should remain out of galleries because that limits who sees it and because art is constantly changing.\n\n"}

Rangamma conceived a child, said to be a miraculous conception, and gave birth to Anasuya, born with a vermilion on her forehead per the account of biographer Richard Schiffman.\n\nWhen Anasuya was completing her second year, she once sat under a pomegranate tree in \"padmasana\" (Lotus Posture) and attained a transcendental meditation state, with her eyes half closed. Every one mistook it as a fit of epilepsy and not noticing the 'yogasana' she had assumed. She returned to her normal consciousness in an hour. On yet another occasion, she was seen sitting in a strange posture with her breath suspended and the eyes turned completely inside. When someone asked her later as to what she was doing, she replied she was in 'Shambhavi Mudra'.`\n\nAs a little girl, she never asked for food, just as she never cried for milk as an infant. She accepted food if it was given, only to give to somebody else who was in need of it. She was treated by several doctors to no avail. It is a paradox of Amma's life that one who was indifferent to eating herself, spent a large portion of her time and energy in feeding others.\n\nOn 5th May 1936, Amma's wedding took place at Bapatla with Brahmandam Nageswara Rao who became later the village officer of Jillellamudi.\n\nAt Jillellamudi, as a young housewife, Amma looked after the needs of her family which came to include two sons and a daughter.

His 1958 book \"On the Track of Unknown Animals\" (originally published in French in 1955 as \"Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées\") is often regarded as one of the best and most influential cryptozoological works.\n\nHeuvelmans was born on 10 October 1916 in Le Havre, France, and raised in Belgium and earned a doctorate in zoology from the Free University of Brussels (now split into the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel). Heuvelmans was a pupil of Serge Frechkop, a proponent of the Theory of Initial Bipedalism. In 1939, his doctoral dissertation concerned the teeth of the aardvark. During World War II he had escaped from a Nazi prison camp and later worked as a jazz singer in Paris. \n\nHeuvelmans' books made reference to literary sources. He was influenced by Jules Verne and Arthur Conan Doyle's book \"The Lost World\" (1912). Though earlier interested in zoological oddities, he credits a 1948 \"Saturday Evening Post\" article, \"There Could be Dinosaurs\" by Ivan T. Sanderson, with inspiring a determined interest in unknown animals. Sanderson discussed the possibility of dinosaurs surviving in remote corners of the world. Heuvelmans was also influenced by the work of Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans, who had defended the existence of the sea serpent.\n\nHeuvelmans wrote many other books and articles, only a few of which have been translated into English. His works sold well among general audiences but saw little attention from mainstream scientists and experts. \"In the Wake of the Sea-Serpents\" was his second book; it was translated into English and sold in the United States in 1968. It consisted of his book on sea serpents with parts of his book on the giant squid (and colossal squid) added. As he continued his researches, he saw the need to \"give a name to the totally new discipline in zoology my research implied. That is how I coined the word 'cryptozoology', the science of hidden animals\".\n\nThere is evidence that Heuvelmans planned to author a third book on fresh-water cryptozoology, but instead he assisted Irish author Peter Costello to produce his 1974 book \"In Search of Lake Monsters\", providing source material from his files.\n\nScience writer David Quammen has stated that Heuvelmans's \"On the Track of Unknown Animals\" is \"heavily researched and encyclopedic\" but contains \"leaps of credulity that leave a skeptical reader behind.\" He also wrote that Heuvelmans was known for making \"overstated claims\".\n\nHis book \"The Natural History of Hidden Animals\" (published posthumously) was heavily criticized. Biologist Aaron Bauer noted that \"Heuvelmans's own writings, this book included, often eschew critical analysis of available data\". John Burton has written that the book's \"credibility is seriously undermined by sloppy research\".\n\nHeuvelmans's wife was the novelist and artist Monique Watteau; she was also the main illustrator of his books. They divorced in 1961, but remained friends and colleagues.\n\nHeuvelmans eventually converted to Buddhism. He died on 22 August 2001 at the age of 84.\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1983 he has been the leading advocate for private owners of government designated cultural heritage sites. He has also pioneered efforts to increase recognition of Norway’s rich cultural heritage by establishing the Norwegian Heritage Foundation and serving as its director for many years. \n\nSulheim grew up on the family farm as one of seven children and its designated heir. Educated as an agronomist, he interned on several large farms in Germany. After graduation, he began studying law but his studies were interrupted in 1980 when he took over Sulheim after his father retired. Government regulations governing historically preserved farm buildings and the consequent burden the state placed on their owners struck him as profoundly unfair. This caused him to appeal to Norway’s Prime Minister for help.\n\nIn 1983 Sulheim formed an association of owners of buildings protected by cultural heritage preservation laws in northern Gudbrandsdalen, whom he describes as \"the loyal unpaid security guards in Norway's largest museum.\" He led the association until 1992, making sure that owners of cultural heritage sites were well represented in the nation’s political arena. During this time he continued his studies, mostly on his own. In 1988, he submitted his thesis in history at the University of Trondheim: Sulheim, a preserved farm, 1923-1978. How does the Cultural Heritage Act function in relation to private ownership? In 2000 he received a Master’s Degree (Cand. Mag.) from the University of Oslo. \n\nIn 1988 Sulheim in association with the Oppland County Municipal Affairs Department established a Rural District Cultural Arts Center in the Vågå district dedicated to training and expanding employment opportunities in cultural heritage preservation. As the center's director, Sulheim initiated the first formal vocational training program focusing on the construction and maintenance of traditional log buildings. He was also able to travel throughout Europe to study the interactions between governments and private owners of protected cultural resources. In 1989 he founded a corporation called Top of Norway which worked with Star Tours and thirty other companies to facilitate and organize cultural tourism in Norway.\n\nIn 1993 Sulheim established the Norwegian Heritage Foundation, with assistance from the Ministry of Municipal Government, For ten hectic years he served as the foundation’s director. His efforts resulted in establishing a quality certification program called \"Olavsrosa\" (Olav’s Praise), a “Take Action” program that saved an estimated 1,800 old houses, and authoring two books: Norwegian Heritage: A maintenance manual for owners of preserved houses, and Norwegian Heritage, a practical guidebook. He also established an exhibit entitled \"Cultural Heritage” in Norway’s information center in Oslo and a journal, Cultural Heritage. In addition, between 1997 and 1990, he contributed nearly 1000 radio, television, newspaper and magazine programs, and journal articles on behalf of the Norwegian Heritage Foundation. \nSulheim started a rural revolt against the slow-moving and unhelpful cultural heritage bureaucracy in Oslo. He clearly and bluntly argued that “The government’s position on heritage conservation is a political disaster, a catastrophe and a huge step backward,\" and that cultural heritage is far too important to be left to government to deal with alone. Cultural heritage site owners also have a right to be heard. He further argued that politicians should look at cultural heritage taxation policy in a broader context: \"If I allow my houses to deteriorate, I break the law, but for every nail I pound in, I have to pay sales tax.\" Also, a sustainable cultural heritage approach must accept use as an important factor: \"I don’t want my farm to be like an old wooden spoon, something people can look at, but can’t use.” He realized early on that government can’t afford to protect Norway’s cultural heritage sites forever by itself. Accordingly, he further argued that if we want to take care of the cultural heritage that we are so proud of, we will need a supportive commercial apparatus as well. Christian Sulheim has succeeded in changing and improving laws and regulations affecting cultural heritage in Norway. Sulheim has also contributed to the local history of Lom, where he contributed the portrait Torgeir T. Garmo and fire protection measures for the Lom stave church.\n\nSulheim has served on the boards and/or agencies of the following organizations: the Society for the Preservation of Norway’s Ancient Monuments, the Oppland County government, the World Wildlife Fund in Norway and the Royal Norwegian Society for Development. In 1999 he was appointed to the society’s Cultural Committee by Norway’s Ministry of the Environment. Beyond Norway, Sulheim has served as Vice President of the Network of National Heritage Organizations since 2000. He was a board member of CHAIN, European Development Project for cultural information, and he led the Norwegian cultural delegation to the United States to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Sons of Norway. He has given over 600 lectures in 15 different countries, including as a guest lecturer at the University of Trento, Italy and to the Russian Parliament.\n\nSulheim has received numerous awards: The Society for the Preservation of Norwegian Ancient Monuments, Order of Urnes, Lorentzen Fund prize, the Norwegian Farmers’ Association Weekly Common Sense Award, and the Dobloug Order of the Polar Star. In 1996 he received Britain’s Prince Philip Medal of Honor, and in 2001 he was elected as the first honorary member of the National Trust of Russia.\n\n2001-2006 Christian Sulheim served as Vice President of ICA Norway, the Norwegian branch of one of the Nordic region’s leading retail companies. 2007–present, as General Manager of the tourism company Top of Norway (ton) \n\n\n"}

The original landsite for the capital was narrowed to 640 acres (2.6 km²) that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. The fourteen-block grid plan was bisected by a broad north-south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th streets. On August 1, the first auction of 306 lots was held.

By 1922 little of significance had been found and Lord Carnarvon decided this would be the final year he would fund the work.\n\nHowever on 4 November 1922, Carter was able to send a telegram to Lord Carnarvon, in England at the time, saying:<br>\"At last have made wonderful discovery in Valley; a magnificent tomb with seals intact; re-covered same for your arrival; congratulations\".\n\nLady Evelyn accompanied her father, and by 24 November 1922 both had arrived in Egypt and were present when the full extent of the stairway to the tomb was cleared and a seal containing the Pharaoh Tutankhamun’s cartouche was found over the doorway. This door was opened and the rubble filled corridor behind cleared, revealing the door to the main tomb. This door, and the main tomb, were to be officially opened under the supervision of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities on 29 November. However on the 26th and 27th, Carter, his assistant Arthur Challender, Lord Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn made one or more unauthorised visits inside the tomb, becoming the first people in modern times to enter it. Challender rigged up electric lighting, illuminating a jumble of items, including gilded couches, chests, thrones, and shrines. They also found two more sealed doorways, including one to the inner burial chamber, guarded by two life-size statues of Tutankhamun. A small hole was found in this doorway and Carter, Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn crawled through it into the inner burial chamber. The diary of Lord Carnarvon’s half-brother Mervyn Herbert, although not a first-hand account, notes that Lady Evelyn, being the smallest of the party, was the first person to enter the burial chamber.\n\nLady Evelyn and her father travelled to England in December 1922, the two returning in January 1923 to be present at the official opening of the inner burial chamber on 16 February. The same month Brograve Beauchamp visited with his parents, Howard Carter providing a tour of Tutankhamun’s Tomb. Soon afterwards Lord Carnarvon contracted blood poisoning and died in Cairo on 5 April 1923. Lady Evelyn left Egypt to return to England with her brother, Lady Carnarvon following with Lord Carnarvon's remains a week later. This was Lady Evelyn's last visit to Egypt. She did, however, maintain contact with Howard Carter and was present at his funeral at Putney Vale Cemetery in 1939.\n\nLady Evelyn attended the opening of the Tutankhamun 50th anniversary celebrations in 1972, including the Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition at the British Museum, London, where she was presented to the Queen, there to open the exhibition.\n\nIn October 1923, Lady Evelyn Herbert married Brograve Beauchamp. They had one child, Patricia Evelyn Beauchamp (11 July 1925 – 7 October 2014).\n\nBrograve became a baronet on the death of his father in February 1925. He served as Conservative Member of Parliament for Walthamstow East from 1931 to 1945, and died 25 August 1976 at the age of 79.\n\nLady Evelyn died in London on 31 January 1980 aged 79\nand is buried, like her husband, at Putney Vale Cemetery. Howard Carter is also buried here.\n\nLady Evelyn Herbert has been portrayed in both films and television productions:\n\nThe German language novel \"Der König von Luxor\" by Philipp Vandenberg published in 2014 includes a largely fictionalised Lady Evelyn Beauchamp as one of the three principal characters.\n"}

{"id": "12307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12307", "title": "Gustave Flaubert", "text": "Gustave Flaubert\n\nGustave Flaubert (; 12 December 1821 – 8 May 1880) was a French novelist. Highly influential, he has been considered the leading exponent of literary realism in his country. He is known especially for his debut novel \"Madame Bovary\" (1857), his \"Correspondence\", and his scrupulous devotion to his style and aesthetics. The celebrated short story writer Guy de Maupassant was a protégé of Flaubert.\n\nFlaubert was born on 12 December 1821, in Rouen, in the Seine-Maritime department of Upper Normandy, in northern France. He was the second son of Anne Justine Caroline (née Fleuriot; 1793–1872) and Achille-Cléophas Flaubert (1784–1846), director and senior surgeon of the major hospital in Rouen. He began writing at an early age, as early as eight according to some sources.\n\nHe was educated at the \"Lycée Pierre Corneille\" in Rouen, and did not leave until 1840, when he went to Paris to study law. In Paris, he was an indifferent student and found the city distasteful. He made a few acquaintances, including Victor Hugo. Toward the end of 1840, he travelled in the Pyrenees and Corsica. In 1846, after an attack of epilepsy, he left Paris and abandoned the study of law.\n\nFrom 1846 to 1854, Flaubert had a relationship with the poet Louise Colet; his letters to her have survived. After leaving Paris, he returned to Croisset, near the Seine, close to Rouen, and lived there for the rest of his life. He did however make occasional visits to Paris and England, where he apparently had a mistress.\n\nPolitically, Flaubert described himself as a \"romantic and liberal old dunce\" (\"vieille ganache romantique et libérale\"), an \"enraged liberal\" (\"libéral enragé\"), a hater of all despotism, and someone who celebrated every protest of the individual against power and monopolies.\n\nWith his lifelong friend Maxime Du Camp, he travelled in Brittany in 1846. In 1849–50 he went on a long journey to the Middle East, visiting Greece and Egypt. In Beirut he contracted syphilis. He spent five weeks in Istanbul in 1850. He visited Carthage in 1858 to conduct research for his novel \"Salammbô\".\n\nFlaubert never married and never had children. His reason for not having children is revealed in a letter he sent to Coulet, dated December 11, 1852. In it he revealed that he was opposed to childbirth, saying he would \"transmit to no one the aggravations and the disgrace of existence.\"\n\nFlaubert was very open about his sexual activities with prostitutes in his writings on his travels. He suspected that a chancre on his penis was from a Maronite or a Turkish girl. He also engaged in intercourse with male prostitutes in Beirut and Egypt; in one of his letters, he describes a \"pockmarked young rascal wearing a white turban\".\n\nAccording to his biographer Émile Faguet, his affair with Louise Colet was his only serious romantic relationship. \n\nFlaubert was a tireless worker and often complained in his letters to friends about the strenuous nature of his work. He was close to his niece, Caroline Commanville, and had a close friendship and correspondence with George Sand. He occasionally visited Parisian acquaintances, including Émile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, Ivan Turgenev, and Edmond and Jules de Goncourt.\n\nThe 1870s were a difficult time for Flaubert. Prussian soldiers occupied his house during the War of 1870, and his mother died in 1872. After her death, he fell into financial difficulty due to business failures on the part of his niece's husband. Flaubert suffered from venereal diseases most of his life. His health declined and he died at Croisset of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1880 at the age of 58. He was buried in the family vault in the cemetery of Rouen. A monument to him by Henri Chapu was unveiled at the museum of Rouen.\n\nHis first finished work was \"November\", a novella, which was completed in 1842.\n\nIn September 1849, Flaubert completed the first version of a novel, \"The Temptation of Saint Anthony.\" He read the novel aloud to Louis Bouilhet and Maxime Du Camp over the course of four days, not allowing them to interrupt or give any opinions. At the end of the reading, his friends told him to throw the manuscript in the fire, suggesting instead that he focus on day-to-day life rather than fantastic subjects.\n\nIn 1850, after returning from Egypt, Flaubert began work on \"Madame Bovary\". The novel, which took five years to write, was serialized in the \"Revue de Paris\" in 1856. The government brought an action against the publisher and author on the charge of immorality, which was heard during the following year, but both were acquitted. When \"Madame Bovary\" appeared in book form, it met with a warm reception.\n\nIn 1858, Flaubert travelled to Carthage to gather material for his next novel, \"Salammbô\". The novel was completed in 1862 after four years of work.\n\nDrawing on his youth, Flaubert next wrote \"L'Éducation sentimentale\" (\"Sentimental Education\"), an effort that took seven years. This was his last complete novel, published in the year 1869.\n\nHe wrote an unsuccessful drama, \"Le Candidat,\" and published a reworked version of \"The Temptation of Saint Anthony\", portions of which had been published as early as 1857. He devoted much of his time to an ongoing project, \"Les Deux Cloportes (The Two Woodlice)\", which later became \"Bouvard et Pécuchet\", breaking the obsessive project only to write the \"Three Tales\" in 1877. This book comprises three stories: \"Un Cœur simple\" (\"A Simple Heart\"), \"La Légende de Saint-Julien l'Hospitalier\" (\"The Legend of St. Julian the Hospitaller\"), and \"Hérodias\" (\"Herodias\"). After the publication of the stories, he spent the remainder of his life toiling on the unfinished \"Bouvard et Pécuchet\", which was posthumously printed in 1881. It was a grand satire on the futility of human knowledge and the ubiquity of mediocrity. He believed the work to be his masterpiece, though the posthumous version received lukewarm reviews. Flaubert was a prolific letter writer, and his letters have been collected in several publications.\n\nAt the time of his death, he may have been working on a further historical novel, based on the Battle of Thermopylae.\n\nFlaubert famously avoided the inexact, the abstract and the vaguely inapt expression, and scrupulously eschewed the cliché. In a letter to George Sand he said that he spends his time \"trying to write harmonious sentences, avoiding assonances.\"\n\nFlaubert believed in, and pursued, the principle of finding \"le mot juste\" (\"the right word\"), which he considered as the key means to achieve quality in literary art. He worked in sullen solitude—sometimes occupying a week in the completion of one page—never satisfied with what he had composed. In Flaubert's correspondence he intimates this, explaining correct prose did not flow out of him and that his style was achieved through work and revision.\n\nThis painstaking style of writing is also evident when one compares Flaubert's output over a lifetime to that of his peers (for example Balzac or Zola). Flaubert published much less prolifically than was the norm for his time and never got near the pace of a novel a year, as his peers often achieved during their peaks of activity. Walter Pater famously called Flaubert the \"martyr of style.\"\n\nIn the assessment of critic James Wood:\nAs a writer, other than a pure stylist, Flaubert was nearly equal parts romantic and realist. Hence, members of various schools, especially realists and formalists, have traced their origins to his work. The exactitude with which he adapts his expressions to his purpose can be seen in all parts of his work, especially in the portraits he draws of the figures in his principal romances. The degree to which Flaubert's fame has extended since his death presents an interesting chapter of literary history in itself. He is also credited with spreading the popularity of the color Tuscany Cypress, a color often mentioned in his chef-d'œuvre \"Madame Bovary\".\n\nFlaubert's lean and precise writing style has had a large influence on 20th-century writers such as Franz Kafka and J. M. Coetzee. As Vladimir Nabokov discussed in his famous lecture series:\n\nThe greatest literary influence upon Kafka was Flaubert's. Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose would have applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool. Kafka liked to draw his terms from the language of law and science, giving them a kind of ironic precision, with no intrusion of the author's private sentiments; this was exactly Flaubert's method through which he achieved a singular poetic effect. The legacy of his work habits can best be described, therefore, as paving the way towards a slower and more introspective manner of writing.\n\nThe publication of \"Madame Bovary\" in 1856 was followed by more scandal than admiration; it was not understood at first that this novel was the beginning of something new: the scrupulously truthful portraiture of life. Gradually, this aspect of his genius was accepted, and it began to crowd out all others. At the time of his death, he was widely regarded as the most influential French Realist. Under this aspect Flaubert exercised an extraordinary influence over Guy de Maupassant, Edmond de Goncourt, Alphonse Daudet, and Zola. Even after the decline of the Realist school, Flaubert did not lose prestige in the literary community; he continues to appeal to other writers because of his deep commitment to aesthetic principles, his devotion to style, and his indefatigable pursuit of the perfect expression.\n\nHis \"Œuvres Complètes\" (8 vols., 1885) were printed from the original manuscripts, and included, besides the works mentioned already, the two plays \"Le Candidat\" and \"Le Château des cœurs\". Another edition (10 vols.) appeared in 1873–85. Flaubert's correspondence with George Sand was published in 1884 with an introduction by Guy de Maupassant.\n\nHe has been admired or written about by almost every major literary personality of the 20th century, including philosophers and sociologists such as Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Paul Sartre whose partially psychoanalytic portrait of Flaubert in \"The Family Idiot\" was published in 1971. Georges Perec named \"Sentimental Education\" as one of his favourite novels. The Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is another great admirer of Flaubert. Apart from \"Perpetual Orgy\", which is solely devoted to Flaubert's art, one can find lucid discussions in Vargas Llosa's \"Letters to a Young Novelist\" (published 2003). In public lecture on May 1966 at the Kaufmann Art Gallery in New York, Marshall McLuhan claimed that \"I derived all my knowledge of media from people like Flaubert and Rimbaud and Baudelaire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5452635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5452635", "title": "Highway of Tears murders", "text": "Highway of Tears murders\n\nThe Highway of Tears is a series of murders and disappearances of mainly Indigenous women along a section of Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada, from 1970 until present.\n\nNumerous municipalities and 23 First Nations communities border the Highway of Tears. The rural region is plagued with poverty and lacks public transportation; many residents turn to hitchhiking as a form of transit or partake in high risk lifestyles to survive. \nAccounts vary as to the exact number of victims. According to the RCMP Project E-Pana list the number of victims is less than 18. E-Pana is limited to cases between 1969 and 2006, female victims who had to either be involved in hitchhiking or other high risk behaviour. Aboriginal organizations estimate that the number of missing women (likely murdered) ranges above 40. Although E-Pana has led to solved cases in other areas, no E-Pana case along the Highway of Tears has been solved.\n\nThe following list contains as comprehensively as possible, all missing or murdered women within the Highway 16 corridor between Prince Rupert and Prince George. E-Pana cases are categorized.\nTo date, a number of people have been convicted in cases related to the Highway of Tears. Three serial killers are among those charged, Brian Peter Arp, Edward Dennis Issac and Cody Legebokoff. Bobby Jack Fowler was strongly implicated in a number of cases related to E-Pana, but died in prison before charges could be laid. Garry Taylor Handlen has been charged with two murders related to E-Pana. Neither Fowler nor Handlen have been charged in the deaths of any of the Highway of Tears victims. The only thing linking them to the Highway of Tears is the E-Pana investigation, the scope of which evolved outside of the Highway of Tears around 2007. It is also possible that Fowler was linked to the Highway of Tears cases because he worked for a now closed Prince George company called Happy's Roofing in 1974. \n\nOn September 11 2014, Canadian serial killer Cody Legebokoff was convicted of first degree murder in the deaths of Loren Donn Leslie, Jill Stacey Stuchenko, Cynthia Frances Maas and Natasha Lynn Montgomery. In September 2016 the BC Court of Appeal confirmed the original conviction. Legebokoff was age 21 when he was arrested in November 2010 for the murder of Loren Leslie.\n\nIn 2009, police converged on a property in Isle Pierre, in rural Prince George, to search for the remains of Nicole Hoar, a young tree planter who went missing on Highway 16 on June 21, 2002. The property was once owned by Leland Vincent Switzer, who is currently serving a prison sentence for the second-degree murder of his brother. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) also searched the property for the other missing women from the Highway of Tears; however, no further actions followed the investigation.\n\nInvestigators are doubtful that they will ever solve all of the murders. They do have persons of interest in several other cases, but not enough evidence to lay charges.\n\nOn October 22, 2015, Elizabeth Denham, the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, published a 65-page report outlining how B.C. government officials had \"triple deleted\" emails relating to the Highway of Tears. In her report \"Access Denied\", Denham describes the act of \"triple deleting\" as transferring an email to the \"deleted\" folder on a computer system, deleting the email from the folder and then overriding the backup that admits the system to retrieve deleted items. By deleting these files, Denham states the government had breached the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. Denham became aware of the scandal in May 2015 after she received a letter from Tim Duncan, the former executive assistant to Transportation Minister Todd Stone. Duncan claimed that as he was responding to an FOI (Freedom of Information) application, ministerial assistant George Gretes ordered for Duncan to search his records for any files pertaining to the Highway of Tears and missing women. Once the files were located, Duncan testified that Gretes ordered for them to be deleted. When Duncan hesitated, Gretes allegedly took the keyboard and \"triple deleted\" all of the emails relating to the Highway of Tears. According to Denham, Gretes originally denied this claim but later admitted to the triple deletion during a second police interview. Denham states that Gretes—who resigned from his job in October 2015—would have then lied under oath. A year earlier in the summer of 2014, a team from the Transportation Ministry toured Highway 16 and conducted numerous meetings with Aboriginal leaders and communities. The significance of this project was to produce safer travel solutions for women living along Highway 16, many of whom had turned to hitchhiking as a way of transportation. In November 2014, the NDP made the FOI request seeking all government files pertaining to missing women, the Highway of Tears and meetings arranged by the ministry: the report Duncan would later respond to. Despite a two-month tour and multiple meetings, the B.C. government claimed the FOI request produced no files relating to the Highway of Tears. According to Denham's report, these records did exist until government officials destroyed them in order to \"skirt freedom of information laws\". In \"Access Denied\", Denham called upon the RCMP to further investigate the triple deletion of government files. In November 2015, Vancouver lawyer Mark Jetté was appointed as special prosecutor within the RCMP investigation. Jetté will act as the RCMP's independent legal adviser as well as administer an independent assessment of the evidence. He will also pursue any criminal charges that may be found appropriate.\n\nIn 2005, the RCMP launched project E-Pana which focused upon the unsolved murders and disappearances of young women along Highway 16 throughout the years between 1969 and 2006. E-Pana sought to discover if there was a single serial killer at work or a multitude of killers operating along the highway. The unit investigated nine cases in 2006, but by 2007 its caseload had doubled to eighteen. The victims involved within the E-Pana investigation followed the criteria of being female, participating in a high risk lifestyle, known to hitchhike and were last seen or their bodies were discovered within a mile from Highway 16, Highway 97 and Highway 5. In the 2009/2010 year, E-Pana received over five million dollars in annual funding but has since dramatically declined due to budget cutbacks; receiving only $806,109 for the 2013/2014 year. In 2013, Craig Callens, the RCMP Deputy Commissioner, warned that further budget reductions from the provincial government would greatly affect the Highway of Tears investigation. A 2014 Freedom of Information request stated that the task force had dropped from seventy officers to twelve officers since 2010. E-Pana is responsible for solving the murder of sixteen-year-old Colleen MacMillen, who was killed in 1974 by the now deceased American serial killer Bobby Jack Fowler. E-Pana now considers Fowler a suspect in the murders of two other highway victims, Gale Weys and Pamela Darlington, both of whom were killed in the 1970s. In 2014, investigations by E-Pana and the Provincial Unsolved Homicide Unit brought murder charges against Garry Taylor Handlen for the death of twelve-year-old Monica Jack in 1978. E-Pana is still investigating the remaining unsolved cases although it is unlikely that all the murders and disappearances will be solved.\n\nIt should also be noted that although E-Pana has led to solved cases in other areas, not a single E-Pana case along the Highway of Tears has been solved to date.\n\nSome critics argue that the lack of results arising from this investigation is the result of systemic racism. This was also believed to be an issue in the case of Vancouver's missing women and the Robert Pickton murders. The issue of systemic racism in these cases is explored in \"Finding Dawn\", the 2006 documentary by Christine Welsh whose film includes a section on the Highway of Tears victim Ramona Wilson, including interviews with family and community members. Often overlooked in reports on the Highway of Tears is the fact that over half of the missing women are First Nation.\n\nActivists argue that media coverage of these cases has been limited, claiming that \"media assign a lesser value to aboriginal women\". Furthermore, despite the fact that these disappearances date back as far as 1969, it was not until 2005 that Project E-Pana was launched, investigating similarities between the cases. In addition, the individual case which has received the most media and police attention thus far is that of Nicole Hoar, a Caucasian woman who disappeared in 2002. Hers was the first of the Highway of Tears cases to be covered in \"The Globe and Mail\", \"Vancouver Sun\", and \"Edmonton Journal\". Gladys Radek, a native activist and the aunt of victim Tamara Chipman, \"believes that if it weren't for Hoar, the police would have invested less effort in investigating cases, and the media would have done little, if anything, to inform the public about the tragedies along the road.\"\n\nPoverty and a lack of public transit has forced many disadvantaged Aboriginal women to turn to hitchhiking as a cheap means of transportation along Highway 16. Many of the Highway of Tears victims were last seen or reported to be hitchhiking before their disappearances.\nIn March 2006, various Aboriginal groups hosted a two-day Highway of Tears symposium at the CN Center in Prince George. In attendance to the event were the victim's families and over 500 Aboriginal leaders from across British Columbia. Shortly thereafter, the Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendation Report was issued with 33 recommendations to improve public transit, deter hitchhiking, and prevent violence towards Aboriginal women. Some of the recommendations from the report include a shuttle bus operation along Highway 16, improved educational, health and social services for Aboriginal people as well counseling and mental health groups organized by Aboriginal workers. These propositions are part of a long-term recommendation to directly confront the issue of First Nations intergenerational poverty. The Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendation Report was endorsed by B.C. inquiry commissioner Wally Oppal in his 2012 Missing Women Commission of Inquiry recommendations. Oppal's public inquiry report into the Robert Pickton case demanded urgent transportation improvement along Highway 16. Like the Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendation Report, Oppal's report also suggested implementing a shuttle bus service along Highway 16 to deter young women from hitchhiking.\n\nOn November 24, 2015, the First Nations Health Authority and B.C. Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure held the Northern Transportation Symposium in Smithers, British Columbia. The symposium included Aboriginal communities and municipalities along Highway 16 and focussed on the issue of medical and non-medical transportation in those regions.

{"id": "4634823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4634823", "title": "Jack Frost (1964 film)", "text": "Jack Frost (1964 film)\n\nJack Frost (, \"Morózko\") is a Soviet film made by Gorky Film Studio, originally released in 1964. It was based on a traditional Russian fairy tale \"Morozko\".\n\nA version with a new soundtrack was released in 1966 in the U.S. It was directed by Aleksandr Rou, and starred Eduard Izotov as Ivan, Natalya Sedykh as Nastenka, and Alexander Khvylya as Father Frost. The script was written by Nikolai Erdman. The soundtrack was composed by Nikolai Budashkin, who was inspired by the works of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.\n\nThe lovely, humble Nastya is despised by her stepmother who favors her own mean-spirited and ugly daughter, Marfushka. Her meek father is powerless to stop his wife. After forcing Nastenka to knit socks before the rooster crows (with Nastya ultimately imploring the sun to go down again so she can have more time), Nastya's stepmother gives Nastya the tasks of feeding the chickens, watering the cattle, splitting wood, and sweeping the yard. Meanwhile, Ivan finishes his chores and heads out into the woods after receiving some final words of guidance from his mother, such as not forgetting his mother, not harming the weak, and honoring those who are old. To all these pieces of advice Ivan off-handedly replies \"Don't worry\" repeatedly.\n\nWhile traveling in the woods, Ivan is accosted by a group of bandits. He quickly distracts them and tosses their wooden clubs so high in the air that he claims they won't fall down again until winter. Later, Ivan meets the elderly Starichok-Borovichok (eng. \"The Little Old Man - the Little Boletus\") (Mikhail Yanshin), who playfully challenges Ivan to try and catch him, offering a prize if he does. Being able to turn invisible, Starichok-Borovichok soon wins and offers a contrite Ivan the prize anyway - a fine bow and quiver of arrows. However, when asked to bow before him in gratitude, Ivan boastfully declares, \"The bear may bow before you, but not Ivan\" and leaves. Starichok-Borovichok remarks that the bear will indeed bow before him, but it would be Ivan's back that would bend.\n\nIvan comes across Nastya in the woods, ordered to pour water on a stump to make flowers grow in it. Taken by her beauty, he immediately asks her to marry him, citing his many accomplishments. She demurs, noting that he is too much of a braggart. Eager to prove his worth, he attempts to shoot a mother bear with her cubs. Starichok-Borovichok is watching nearby, and as the panicked Nastya puts her water bucket on his head, he changes Ivan's head into a bear. Horrified at the change, Ivan accuses Nastya of being a witch and runs off, leaving her to weep alone by the stump, her tears causing flowers to grow from it.\n\nWandering the land, Ivan comes across Starichok-Borovichok again, who scolds Ivan over his selfish nature, and how he never acted selflessly for anyone else. Thinking that all he must do to change back is a good deed, Ivan immediately seeks out people, demanding to know how he can help them; having a bear's head only terrifies them, however, and they all flee from him. He finally comes across an old woman carrying sticks to her home and offers to carry her, despite the distance being over many mountains. Arriving at her home, the woman thanks Ivan, noting how handsome he must be; though Ivan notes he is still a bear and thinks she is mocking him, she explains that she is blind - which is why she didn't run from him. Returning to the woods where he and Nastya first met, Ivan comes across the old woman's walking stick and takes pity on her, vowing to return it. Nearby, Starichok-Borovichok is pleased at his selflessness and restores Ivan to human form. \n\nMeanwhile, the evil stepmother is trying to marry off Marfushka. After dressing her up in fine clothes, covering her in makeup and attaching a false braid on to Marfushka's head, she forces Nastya to wear a rag over her head and puts mud on her face to make her ugly. A wealthy suitor comes and asks Marfushka, who has never done a day's work in her life, to prepare a meal for him. While chasing geese into a pond, Marfushka nearly drowns until she is rescued by Nastya. In the process, Marfushka's braid and makeup wash away and Nastya's beauty is revealed. The suitor and his mother choose Nastya for a bride instead. The stepmother orders her husband to leave Nastya in the woods. On the way, the father decides he's had enough of his wife's bullying and vows to bring Nastenka back home. Believing her stepmother will be even crueler to him for doing so, Nastya jumps off the back of his sleigh. There, she comes across Morozko (Father Frost) bringing winter to the woods. Touched by her kindness and unselfishness, he rescues her from freezing to death and brings her to his home.\n\nIvan searches for Nastya, now that he's fully human again. He comes across Baba Yaga, whom he pleads for aid to find Nastya. She refuses to help, and after a battle of wills with her moving house (which the old woman loses), she animates a group of trees to kill Ivan. After nearly being cooked alive, Ivan tricks her and threatens to bake the witch in her own oven until she tells him how to find Nastya. After he leaves, the angry Baba Yaga sends her black cat to cause Nastya's death before Ivan can reach her. The enchanted sled sent by the Baba Yaga to show Ivan the way to Nastya leaves him trapped in a snowbank. While Father Frost is running some errands, the cat tricks Nastya into accidentally touching his staff, which freezes her solid. Nastya's father and dog sense that she is in trouble. The stepmother and Marfushka prevent him from leaving, but the dog escapes and rescues Ivan from freezing in the snow. They both arrive at Morozko's home to find her frozen. Ivan pleads for forgiveness for his behavior towards her. The power of love trumps the staff's power, and she is restored. To celebrate, Morozko gives Nastya and Ivan a large dowry of jewels and a horse-driven sleigh for their impending nuptials.\n\nThey return to the village, where the father welcomes Ivan as his son-in-law but the stepmother becomes jealous and the greedy Marfushka eyes their fortune and demands the same. Unfortunately for her, when Marfushka tries to duplicate Nastya's adventure in the snowbound forest, Morozko is so horrified by her rudeness that he sends her back on a pig-driven sleigh, with a box full of crows as a dowry. The stepmother is humiliated in front of the entire village and the father finally stands up for himself and regain his place as head of the household. On their way to Ivan's home, he and Nastya are accosted by the bandits he'd encountered before, this time with help from Baba Yaga. After being overpowered, they are saved when the clubs from earlier fall conveniently on the bandits' heads, and they trap the witch in her own giant mortar. Nastya and Ivan have a sumptuous wedding and live happily ever after.\n\n\n\nThe original Russian version was released on DVD in 2000 by Ruscico under the cover title \"Morozko\". It has nine different subtitle options including English, as well as Russian, English and French audio tracks and special features. It was previously released on VHS by United Home Video under the title \"Magical Wonderland\".\n\nIn 1997, \"Morozko\" was the featured film on the movie-mocking television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" as experiment (episode) #813; it was released on DVD July 13, 2010 as part of the series' Volume XVIII DVD set.\n\nThis fairy tale is still very popular in Central and Eastern Europe. The movie has been shown on Czechoslovak (now Czech and Slovak) TV channels (under name \"Mrazík\" or \"Mrázik\") annually around Christmas or New Year's Day since 1965. According to some critics, Czech dubbing may overcome the Russian version. Baba Yaga was dubbed in the Czech Republic by František Filipovský.\n\nSteven Spielberg said that the film \"Jack Frost\" was the forerunner of many Hollywood blockbusters.\n\n"}
{"id": "43889870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43889870", "title": "James Murrell", "text": "James Murrell\n\nJames Murrell (c. 1785 – 16 December 1860), also known as Cunning Murrell, was an English cunning man, or professional folk magician, who spent most of his life in the town of Hadleigh in the eastern English county of Essex. In this capacity, he reportedly employed magical means to aid in healing both humans and animals, exorcising malevolent spirits, countering witches, and restoring lost or stolen property to its owner.\n\nBorn in Rochford, Essex, Murrell grew up in the area before moving to Southwark in London, where he was married in 1812. He had seventeen children with his wife, and the family later moved back to Essex, settling in Hadleigh, where Murrell gained work as a shoemaker. At some point he also began working as a cunning man, gaining fame for his work in this field on both sides of the Thames Estuary. Describing himself as \"the Devil's Master\", he cultivated an air of mystery about himself, also experimenting with the creation of iron witch bottles. On a number of occasions his magical activities gained the attention of the local press. Although many residents valued his services and viewed him as a good and benevolent individual, his activities proved controversial and divisive. Many educated figures criticised what they saw as his role in encouraging superstition among the local population; his death certificate recorded his profession as that of a \"quack doctor\".\n\nMurrell's fame greatly increased after his death when he was made the subject, albeit in a highly fictionalised form, of a 1900 novel by Arthur Morrison. Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man, published in \"The Strand\" magazine. During the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell, finding much local folklore still surrounding him in the Hadleigh area, including the allegation that he had the ability to fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances. Murrell has continued to attract the attention of historians and folklorists studying English folk magic, and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton, Owen Davies, and Ralph Merrifield.\n\nJames Murrell was likely born in Rochford, Essex in 1785, and then baptised on 9 October 1785 in the St. Mary the Virgin Church in Hawkwell, Essex. His parents were named Edward Murrell and Hannah Murrell, née Dockrell. According to the investigations of the journalist Arthur Morrison, Murrell was the seventh son of a seventh son. After completing school, Murrell entered into an apprenticeship with the surveyor G. Emans, who operated from Burnham, a town to which Murrell's brother Edward had moved. There is evidence that Murrell subsequently moved to London, where he worked as a stillman at a chemist's shop in the 1800s or early 1810s.\n\nOn 12 August 1812, Murrell married Elizabeth Francis Button at St. Olave's Church, Bermondsey in Southwark. Button was also from Essex, having been baptised in Hadleigh on 5 December 1790. Between 1814 and 1834, there are baptismal and burial records of the couple having seventeen children, many of whom did not survive infancy.\n\nOn 26 December 1820, Murrell returned to Essex to attend the wedding of his sister Hannah at Hawkwell's St. Mary the Virgin Church. She and her new husband Daniel Whitwell then proceeded to move to nearby Canewdon, with Murrell visiting them there on a regular basis thereafter. By the early 1840s, one of Murrell's daughters, Louisa, had moved in with the childless Daniel and Hannah.\n\nElizabeth Murrell died in Hadleigh on 16 April 1839, aged forty-nine. The cause of death was cited as \"inflammation of the chest\", and her body was buried on 21 April in Hadleigh's St. James the Less Church. In the 1841 national census, Murrell was documented as a shoemaker living in Hadleigh with four of his children (Eliza, Matilda, Edward, and Eleanor). However, in the June 1844 wedding documentation of Eliza, Murrell was listed as a labourer, and on the October 1844 marriage documentation of Matilda, he was listed as a herb doctor. By the 1851 national census, he again specified his profession as that of a shoemaker, and recorded that he was living in Hadleigh with his children Edward, Eleanor, and Louisa, as well as with his grandson William Spendle.\n\nNo images of Murrell survive. Accounts describe him as a short man who walked with his hands behind his back and hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.\n\nIn south-east Essex, Murrell was known as \"The Devil's Master\", a title that he himself used as a self-description. He cultivated an air of mystery about himself by keeping himself largely apart from wider community life, speaking seldom, and traveling largely at night. His house was locally known as a \"place to avoid\" and those visiting him reportedly often waited for some time outside, plucking up the courage to enter. Within the cottage, Murrell had drying herbs hanging from his ceiling, and his devices were reported to include a crystal, a mirror, and a bowl of water. Other items that Murrell used in his magical practices were a copper charm with which he would allegedly distinguish whether an individual was lying or not, and a \"trick\" telescope that supposedly enabled him \"to see through brick walls\". The latter device was examined by an acquaintance of Murrell's, who deemed it to be \"a clumsily home-made arrangement of bits of looking-glass, such as might once have been bought at a toy-shop\". Murrell possessed a library of books, including works on astrology and astronomy, conjuration, and medical texts. He also wrote a number of personal notebooks containing information on such topics, the last of which survived into at least the 1950s.\n\nMurrell claimed that he could exorcise malevolent spirits, destroy witches, and restore lost or stolen property to its owner, as well as providing services as an astrologer, herbalist, and animal healer. He charged a halfpenny for curing warts, and two shillings and six pence for breaking a witch's spell. He was reputed to cure sick animals by passing his hands over their affected area, muttering a prayer, and then hanging an amulet about their neck, and was requested to use these powers at farms in Essex, Suffolk, and northern Kent. During his lifetime, Murrell was known on both sides of the Thames Estuary, although not apparently beyond that. He did however receive postal correspondence from a range of places, including from Essex girls who were working as maids in London.\n\nMurrell used witch bottles as part of his magical practices, and, during the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple encountered claims that Murrell was able to summon anyone he wished using them, including individuals who had gone overseas. Murrell experimented with the use of a witch bottle constructed out of iron; he had two such devices created by a local smith, Stephen Choppen, and had the plug at the mouth soldered up before the bottle was placed in a fire as part of an anti-bewitchment spell. The idea behind this was that the bottle itself would not explode under the heat, and that thus it could be reused on other occasions. According to folklore collected by Maple, the smith's attempts, which were initially unsuccessful, succeeded only after Murrell had recited a charm.\n\nAccording to Maple's research, various accounts of Murrell's astrological activities continued to be told in the community after the latter's death. One held that he was able to predict the death of a man to the \"very day and hour\" while another was that he also predicted the time of his own death to the very minute. It was claimed that on one occasion he was asked to provide the horoscope of a newborn child, but that he refused, stating that \"Make the most of the child, you will not have it for long\", after which the child soon died, while when an old lady asked him to predict the future for her, he refused to do so for more than nine years ahead, with her dying in the eighth.\n\nMorrison found that the locals whom he spoke to – many of whom remembered Murrell from several decades before – found the cunning man to be \"a white and lawful wizard, who warred against the powers of darkness with all his might\"; they added that it was \"no sin to employ the arts of a man like him\". Conversely, Maple noted that his research indicated that attitudes toward Murrell varied within the local community. Although many individuals, particularly among the poor, viewed him as a valuable member of the community, others – particularly among the wealthier strata of society – deemed him to be \"a dangerous quack and disseminator of superstitious nonsense\". Maple found one woman, Mrs Petchey, who described him as \"a smuggler and a bad man. He did things that wouldn't be allowed today - them witchcrafts, I mean. Nowadays, people would say he'd sold his soul to the Devil, wouldn't they? They'd put him away for his witchcrafts.\" Conversely, Maple noted that Mrs Murrell, who was a descendent of James, described the cunning man as \"a good man and a regular churchgoer\". According to the folklore obtained by Maple, Murrell would often have debates about Christian theology with a local parson, the Reverend Thomas Espin – who had been Professor of Pastoral Theology at Queen's College, Birmingham – and that Espin expressed the view that Murrell \"knows his Bible better than I do... He is either a very good man or a very bad one, and I can't make up my mind which.\"\n\nSeveral accounts about Murrell's activities have been preserved, either because they were reported on by the regional press or because they were passed down in oral tradition. One example focused around a rumour that had spread in nearby Canewdon which claimed that two prominent local women were malevolent witches. One of these individuals was Mary Ann Atkinson, the wife of the Reverend William Atkinson, the vicar of Canewdon. The other was Eliza Lodwick, a widow who took control of the 500 acre Lambourne Hall following the death of her husband in 1826; on two separate occasions labourers were convicted of stealing from her, while another died accidentally on her property. Locals concerned that these women were witches approached the vicar with their beliefs, but he dismissed them. They subsequently turned to Murrell, asking for his aid in exposing the women as witches. According to claims made in the 1950s by the-then 94-year-old local man Arthur Downes, the Canewdon villagers believed that Murrell could force all of the witches to assemble and dance about the churchyard against their will by whistling. However, the vicar intervened, with locals believing that he was doing so to protect his wife. The vicar himself died in March 1847.\n\nIn April 1849, the \"Ipswich Express\" and \"Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper\" reported on a case in a village near to Rayleigh in which a girl had been afflicted with fits. Her family believed that a witch was to blame, with Murrell being called in to free her of the perceived bewitchment. He commissioned the local blacksmith to create an iron witch bottle, into which he placed toe-nail clippings and locks of hair belonging to the putative victim. The bottle was then placed into the hearth and heated until it exploded, with this supposedly defeating the witch's machinations.\n\nIn February 1857 the \"Chelmsford Chronicle\" reported that £10 in silver had been stolen from Golding Spearman, keeper of the Tilbury Fort canteen. When the police were unable to identify the culprit, Spearman turned to Murrell, who asserted that he would place a spell on the thief which would result in the return of the money. Shortly after, a soldier discovered the stolen money and returned it to Spearman, who attributed its retrieval to Murrell.\n\nIn September 1858, the Brazier family accused Mrs Mole, a labourer's wife who lived in East Thorpe, Essex, of bewitching their daughter and livestock. Hoping to have the bewitchment removed, they consulted a local cunning-man known as Burrell, who lived at nearby Copford. When Burrell was unable to help, they proceeded to consult Murrell, inviting him to come to East Thorpe to remove the curse. Murrell's planned visit generated much anticipation in East Thorpe's community, with the local rector attempting to calm the situation by requesting that the parish relieving officer move the allegedly bewitched girl to the union-house, where she could be examined by the parish surgeon. Nevertheless, the officer of the poor refused to comply, asserting that Murrell's arrival would correct the problem. Persisting, the rector applied to the local magistrate to ensure that police would be in the village on the day of Murrell's arrival, to ensure that the crowd would be controlled. On the day itself, a crowd of two hundred had gathered, and proceeded to Mrs Mole's house with the intention of carrying out folk justice; concerned by this illegal behaviour, the rector stood outside of her door and forbade the crowd entry, prior to police arriving and dispersing the mob.\n\nOn 9 November 1858, the \"Bury and Norwich Post\" recorded that earlier that month, a waistcoat, silk handkerchief, and £3 in gold were stolen from a labourer, Richard Butcher, who lived in Stanford-le-Hope. Butcher had gone to Murrell, asking him to use his skills to locate and retrieve his stolen property; when Murrell failed to do so, Butcher turned to the police to apprehend the culprit. Other accounts were passed down in local folk accounts; Maple interviewed an eighty-six-year-old Mrs Petchey, who stated that \"My mother lost a brooch, and Murrell told her who had stolen it. It was her own sister-in-law. He wouldn't tell her, though, unless she promised not to tell anyone. The brooch was back in its old place a few days later.\"\n\nLocal records indicate that Murrell died in Hadleigh on 16 December 1860. On his death certificate, his profession was listed as \"Quack Doctor\", and his cause of death was attributed to \"natural causes\". On 23 December his body was inhumed into the eastern side of the churchyard at St James the Less Church, near to where many of his deceased children had been buried. It was not marked by any tombstone.\n\nHis son later told Morrison that the cunning man had informed his own daughter of the exact time and date at which he would die prior to it actually happening. Another story reports that Murrell took to his death bed aware of his oncoming demise, informing his daughter to turn away the curate \"For I be the devil's master as be well knowed. Clergymen den't bother me in the oad time, they shan't now [sic]\". Conversely, Maple recorded a story that in his final hours, Murrell was visited by the local curate; Murrell was frustrated by the latter's attempts to administer religious consolation and eventually scared him off by shouting out \"I am the Devil's master\".\n\nAn alternate story spread that Murrell had been killed by a witch-bottle that had been placed into a fire by an aggrieved local man who believed that Murrell had bewitched his donkey and thus caused its death. The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield concluded that this tale was \"probably entirely apocryphal\". Another story given by Choppen was that Murrell's son Edward – or \"Buck\" as he was nicknamed – had taken the cunning man's final witch-bottle. Placing the bottle in his household fire, it was there that the bottle exploded and destroyed a wall of Buck's cottage.\n\nMurrell left no will. His son Edward later claimed that Murrell's landlord soon buried a wooden chest with the old man's papers in the garden of the cottage, deeming their associations with magic to be dangerous. Edward claimed that he subsequently dug the chest up again. Murrell's personal effects were treated as souvenirs, and several were treated as though they retained magical and supernatural associations for many years after his death. Murrell's \"trick\" telescope was sold by his son for half-a-guinea; the purchaser was allegedly found dead shortly after with half-a-guinea lodged in his throat, resulting in claims that the telescope itself brought bad luck onto anyone who possessed it. In 1960, Maple commented that Murrell's whalebone umbrella had been owned by a local undertaker until fairly recently, while he also noted that Murrell's carved chest was in the possession of a woman who lived at Southend-on-Sea.\n\nMaple ultimately described Murrell as \"the greatest and certainly the most influential of all the Cunning Men of the Essex marshlands\", and elsewhere he termed him \"perhaps the last of the great Cunning Men\", noting that upon his death Murrell \"became part of the great heritage of English witch mythology\". Having studied the cunning man's legacy during the late 1950s, Maple believed that Murrell \"succeeded in agitating the old fear of witchcraft into something like a mania\" among the local community, and that \"in doing so he unwittingly preserved the old traditions and folktales for a generation beyond their normal span, and in this respect folklorists are in his debt\". The historian Ronald Hutton has characterised Murrell as the \"most celebrated cunning man in the whole of nineteenth-century southern England\".\n\nMurrell continued to remain the subject of local discussion after his death. Maple believed that the legacy created within these communities was a combination of both fact and myth, with \"Murrell the man\" being supplanted by \"Murrell the myth\", around which a \"vast wealth of lore\" accrued. Maple noted that many of the attributes associated with witches in British folklore came to be associated with the cunning man. For instance, he highlighted the existence of local stories that credited Murrell with the ability to fly, and that he was once observed flying over the River Crouch on a broomstick. Another story held that Murrell had been talking to a group of old men in Canvey Island before suddenly vanishing and reappearing in his own village, which was several miles away.\n\nOne young boy reported having observed the ghost of Murrell collecting herbs at some point after this death; he passed this story on to his daughter, who told it to Maple. Hadleigh also had other ghost lore traditions, surrounding figures known as the White Lady and the Black Man, the latter being a prince and the former a woman who would allegedly invite passers by to join her in a waltz through the ruins of Hadleigh Castle.\n\nIn a 2014 article published in the British occult magazine \"The Cauldron\", Richard Ward suggested that the folk stories surrounding Murrell were later transposed to another local figure, George Pickingill of Canewdon, who would also came to be regarded as a cunning man in local folklore by the 1950s. He noted in particular that Pickingill was accredited with the ability to command the witches of Canewdon to reveal themselves, a trait that Downes had previously attributed to Murrell. Hutton accepted this as a possibility yet lamented that the claim seemed to be \"incapable of solid proof\".\n\nIn 2011, Robert Hallman, a local Hadleigh resident, suggested that the community should memorialise Murrell in some way, either by naming a local street after him or erecting a statue in the centre of the town.\n\nThree decades after Murrell's death, in the late 19th century, Morrison visited Hadleigh on a holiday, expressing the view that the area was \"still in the eighteenth century as regards aspect, costume, habits, and mode of thought\". He learned about Murrell, and decided \"to write a story about him\", believing that \"some might find it hard to believe that such a man, practicing such arts and wielding such influence, could have lived so recently within so short a distance from London\". The landlord of the Castle Inn, a local pub, showed Morrison to the house in which Murrell had once lived, and the journalist was also able to meet with Choppen, the smith who had made Murrell's witch bottles. Morrison found that Choppen was living in a small house on the outskirts of Hadleigh; the craftsman revealed that while he had none of the bottles left, he was in possession of Murrell's spectacles. Morrison subsequently met with Murrell's son Edward – \"a short, sturdy old fellow, with ashock head of loose, white hair\" – who was then living in Thundersley. Morrison subsequently authored \"Cunning Murrell\", a fictitious account of Murrell's life, as well as a more objective account, the latter for \"The Strand\" magazine. It was Morrison's novel that turned Murrell into a national figure and \"inflated the name of the old Essex wizard above all others of his craft\".\n\nAt the turn of the century between the 19th and 20th, the Reverend King, an antiquarian who worked as the vicar of Leigh, began to examine Murrell's life, believing it to have had some significance, although never completed his research.\n\nMurrell's correspondences and papers – then contained in the wooden chest owned by his son – were examined by Morrison during the course of his research. These texts survived until 1956, at which point they were burned by someone who did not believe them to be of any importance. Many of Murrell's handwritten books were also lost, although his scrapbook of astrological data had survived until at least the late 1950s, when it was in the collection of a local man who also possessed Murrell's iron churchwarden pipe.\n\nMaple published a 1960 paper on Murrell in the Folklore Society's journal, \"Folklore\", which was based both on the earlier textual sources and on oral traditions that he had obtained from elderly residents of the district. These included one of his descendants, a Mrs Murrell of Westcliff-on-Sea. Troubled by the mixed reception that Murrell had, she expressed the view that he was a good man. She also commented that Murrell's power to control mechanical objects had remained within the family, characterising them as \"natural mechanics\".\n"}

They were posthumously bestowed the title of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem on May 23, 2005. The medals and a diploma were presented by the Israeli ambassador, David Peleg, to their two surviving daughters, Teresa and Elżbieta, at the Branicki Palace in Warsaw.\nThe family of Artur Citryn, including his mother, sister and a female cousin, managed to escape from the Warsaw Ghetto \"(pictured)\" in 1941, before the mass deportations began. They went to a temporarily freer Jewish ghetto in Adamów, from where Mrs. Citryn began a prolonged search for a safe hiding place for her children. She succeeded only two years later, in the summer of 1943. Together with Artur, she arrived at the house of the Latoszyński family living in the village of Lendo Wielkie. According to the testimony of one of Latoszyński's daughters, towards the end of July 1943, they were visited by a young-looking Jewish mother with a thin 10-year-old boy who was introduced as Antoś Cytryniarz from Warsaw. His mother, Mrs Citryn explained that she had heard from their neighbors about Jerzy Latoszyński who owned the largest farm in the area, frequently in need of additional help. The boy, Artur Citryn, was taken in with their blessing.\n\nDepending on the season, Artur slept in the gardener’s room, in the attic, in the family kitchen in winter or in a barn on bales of hay during the summer. His responsibilities included grazing cattle and looking after them. The Latoszyńskis had a fair–sized library of Polish books, and Artur spent a lot of time reading, which soon became his most beloved pastime. He read adventure stories by Karl May and children’s magazines, and while distracted, would allow his cows to cause considerable damage on occasion.\n\nPatrolling Germans as well as local partisans raided the farm numerous times in search of money and provisions. At such times, Artur would hide behind Mrs. Latoszyński along with her own children, pretending to be her son. In the spring of 1945, as soon as the Nazis retreated, Mrs Citryn returned to the farm to take back her child. The boy didn’t want to leave and cried. He had grown accustomed to his new place in life and wanted to remain with the Latoszyńskis, who had since become his second family.\n\n"}

He is often credited with the introduction of paper money to Europe. He became a commissioner in the National Board of Trade after his arrival in Sweden in 1647 and began submitting proposals for banking institutions to King Charles X Gustav in the 1650s. The first two such proposals were rejected but the third, which promised half the bank's profits to the crown, was accepted.\nStockholms Banco was thus founded in 1657 with Palmstruch appointed as general manager. The bank itself was nothing new as it was simply an imitation of the successful public deposit banks of Amsterdam and Hamburg, however Palmstruch himself added two important innovations. The first of these was to use money deposited into accounts at the bank to finance loans, however this soon became a problem as the deposits were usually short-term and the loans long-term, meaning that deposited money was unavailable to be withdrawn by account holders. Palmstruch's second innovation, and his solution to this problem, was the introduction in 1661 of \"Kreditivsedlar\" (\"credit paper\"), the first European banknotes, which would be exchangeable at any time for the gold and silver coins they were replacing. These were very successful, but the bank began lending more than it could afford and printed too many banknotes without the necessary collateral, leading to the bank's collapse in 1668.\n\nPalmstruch was charged with irresponsible book-keeping and with not having the cash to repay these credit notes due to miscalculation and omissions in his book-keeping. He was unable to make up this shortage and in 1668 was sentenced to loss of his title, loss of his banking privilege, and eternal exile or death. The government reprieved the death penalty and Palmstruch was instead imprisoned. He remained in prison until 1670 and died the following year at the age of 60.\n\n"}

He moved to Mexico City during the Mexican Revolution and witnessed the then-Constitutionalist general Obregón closing churches and arresting priests who were suspected of supporting former president Victoriano Huerta. In 1920, he joined the National League for the Defense of Religious Freedom, which opposed the governments of Obregón (1920–1924) and Plutarco Elías Calles and reportedly was also involved in the Cristero movement.\n\nDuring the Calles administration, oppression against the Catholic Church greatly expanded in 1926 under the Calles Law, which provided severe penalties for priests and individuals who violated the provisions of the 1917 Constitution. For instance, wearing clerical garb in public (outside Church buildings) earned a fine of 500 pesos (approximately $250 US at the time); a priest who criticized the government could be imprisoned for five years, with no right to trial by jury.\n\nSome states enacted even more oppressive measures. Chihuahua enacted a law permitting only a single priest to serve the entire Catholic congregation of the state. To help enforce the law, Calles seized church property, expelled all foreign priests, and closed the monasteries, convents and religious schools.\n\nObregón had been more lenient to Catholics during his time in office, but the Cristeros and almost everyone else believed that Calles was his puppet leader. In 1927, two of León Toral's friends Humberto and Miguel Pro were executed after having been wrongly convicted of plotting to assassinate Obregón. Thus, having been incited by a Catholic nun, Concepción Acevedo de la Llata (also known as \"Madre Conchita\"), he decided to assassinate Obregón, whom he blamed for the Mexican government's atrocities against the Catholic Church, if Obregón was reelected.\n\nOn 17 July 1928, two weeks after Obregón had been re-elected president, León Toral entered disguised as a caricaturist to \"La Bombilla\", a restaurant in San Ángel, during a banquet organized to honor General Obregón. He made a caricature of Obregón, an orchestra director, and Aarón Sáenz and showed them to Obregón, who told him the drawing had good likeness and suggested he continue. After Obregón turned around to sit down, León Toral suddenly drew a gun and shot him five or six times in the back, killing Obregón instantly.\n\nLeón Toral was arrested immediately and pleaded guilty, claiming he killed Obregón in order to facilitate the establishment of the Kingdom of Christ. Mother Conchita was also arrested and received a 20-year prison sentence but was pardoned after serving 13 and eventually married Carlos Castro Balda, a bomber of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. León Toral was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in February 1929. His last words were \"¡Viva Cristo Rey!\" (Long Live Christ the King!), the battle cry of the Cristeros.\n"}

The comic premiered on June 4, 1908 in the newspaper L'Épatant, published by Société Parisienne d'Édition. It is considered to be one of the earliest French comics and one of the longest-running. it centers on a group of anarchist youth getting in trouble. In French informal speech of the early twentieth century, \"nickel-plated feet\" was a moniker for slackers, workshy people.\n\nThe story features three main characters named Croquignol, Filochard, and Ribouldingue, three brothers who are good hearted but at the same time are indolent crooks and slackers, characteristics of anarchists.\n\n\"Les Pieds Nickelés\" was originally drawn in text comics format, with the text written beneath the images. Louis Forton had to struggle with his editors to use actual speech balloons, as was common in American comics.\n\nAt the beginning of their \"career\", the 'nickel-plated feet' constantly clash with the police in various adventures where they rarely have the upper hand. Gradually, as the comic book became increasingly popular, the Pied-Nickelés gain widened scope, complexity, and audacity. Over time, they are seen rubbing shoulders with the elite of their time, such as the President of France, the King of England, and the Kaiser of Germany.\n\nWith the arrival of First World War, the personalities of the Pied-Nickelés takes a new turn. They embody the popular French values of ingenuity and resourcefulness known as \"System D\". Operating behind the enemy lines under multiple guises, they constantly fool the \"Boches\" (French derogatory nickname for the Germans), portrayed like big heavy oafs without any finesse and easily fooled.\n\nLouis Forton continued to draw the Pied Nickelés until his death in 1934, after which the series was taken over by Aristide Perré and Albert Badert. However, it was not until Pellos took over in 1948 that the Nickelés returned to success. The successive authors of the Nickelés thus changed the comics and evolved the comics in new directions.\n\nIn 2010, Onapratut publishes a compilation of the contributions of Michel Baril, Aurélien Bédéneau, Fabien Bertrand, Paul Burckel, Ced, Clotka, Dib, François Duprat, Frédéric Duprat, Elric, Filak, Stéphane Girod and Olivier Ka. , Lommsek, Alejandro Milà, Pasto, Radi, Loïc Senan, Thibaut Soulcié, Unter, Waltch, Wayne, Wouzit, Carali, Caza, Hardy, Hugot, Lamorthe, Laurel, Thierry Martin, O'Groj, Obion, Nancy Peña, Jeff Pourquié, Olivier Schwartz, Al Séverin, Walthéry, and Wasterlain. The cover design is the work of Pascal Rabaté.\n\nIn French informal speech of the early twentieth century, \"nickel-plated feet\" was a moniker for slackers, workshy people. The meaning extended later to include in the 21st century characters not very commendable, conspiracy minded, rogue, both dishonest and clumsy. For example, this expression was used by the media in the Clearstream affair, where it was widely used to describe the various protagonists. The same was true of the operation of the \"Ark of Zoe\".\n\nLes Pieds Nickelés also inspired a 1972 magazine where the cartoonist Régis Loisel made his debut.\n\nIn 2011, the cartoonist Luz replaced the headband of the one-eyed character Filochard with adjustable sunglasses.\n\nLouis Forton lead the publication under a pen name. In 1934, he decided to focus on other projects, and let someone take over.\n\nStarting from 1991, a series of new \"Pieds Nickeles\" to represent the \"New Adventures\" premiered, a collaboration of multiple publishers.\n\nThe comics center on 3 principal protagonists, Croquignol, Filochard, and Ribouldingue, who evolve greatly over the run of the comics. Under the authorship of Louis Forton, all drawn to the same size and proportions with Croquignol being the leader of the trio. All three, under the purview of Pellos developed their own personalities: \n\nAlthough they disguise themselves regularly, they also have the same recurrent style:\n\nAmong the recurring characters of the series, one crosses in some episodes:\nOn retrouve aussi, parmi les adversaires traditionnels :\nThe travels of the Les Pieds Nickelés generally crosses the paths of the rich, the bourgeois, the peasants, who are distinguished by their stupidity and naivety, making them the privileged prey of the nickel-plated feet.

A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term \"sexual orientation\" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies. However, most definitions include a psychological component (such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire) and/or a behavioural component (which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s). Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or identity.\n\nThe high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to societal attitudes towards homosexuality. The Pew Research Center's 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that \"[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality.

A Boer war hero during the Second Boer War, he would eventually fight to have South Africa become a British Dominion.\n\nIn 1905, as prime minister, he called for the newly discovered Cullinan Diamond to be presented to King Edward VII.\n\nLouis Botha was born in Greytown, Natal, South Africa one of 13 children born to Louis Botha Senior (26 March 1827 – 5 July 1883) and Salomina Adriana van Rooyen (31 March 1829 – 9 January 1886). He briefly attended the school at Hermannsburg before his family relocated to the Orange Free State. The name Louis runs throughout the family, with every generation since General Louis Botha having the eldest son named Louis.\n\nLouis Botha led \"Dinuzulu's Volunteers\", a group of Boers that had supported Dinuzulu against Zibhebhu in 1884.\n\nBotha later became a member of the parliament of Transvaal in 1897, representing the district of Vryheid.\n\nIn 1899, Louis Botha fought in the Second Boer War, initially joining the Krugersdorp Commando, continuing to fight under Lucas Meyer in Northern Natal, and later as a general commanding and leading Boer forces impressively at Colenso and Spion Kop. On the death of P. J. Joubert, he was made commander-in-chief of the Transvaal Boers, where he demonstrated his abilities again at Belfast-Dalmanutha. After the battle at the Tugela, Botha granted a twenty-four-hour armistice to General Buller to enable him to bury his dead.\n\nWinston Churchill revealed that General Botha was the man who captured him at the ambush of a British armoured train on 15 November 1899. also claims that Botha captured Churchill at train ambush 15 November 1899. Churchill was not aware of the man's identity until 1902, when Botha travelled to London seeking loans to assist his country's reconstruction, and the two met at a private luncheon. The incident is also mentioned in Arthur Conan Doyle's book, \"The Great Boer War\", published in 1902. But more recent sources claim that Field-Cornet Sarel Oosthuizen was in fact the Boer-soldier who, at gunpoint, captured Churchill. Another version claims that the unit to capture Churchill was the Italian Volunteer Legion and its commander, Camillo Ricchiardi.\n\nAfter the fall of Pretoria in June 1900, Louis Botha led a concentrated guerrilla campaign against the British together with Koos de la Rey and Christiaan de Wet. The success of his measures was seen in the steady resistance offered by the Boers to the very close of the three-year war.\n\nBotha was a representative of his countrymen in the peace negotiations of 1902, and was signatory to the Treaty of Vereeniging. After the grant of self-government to the Transvaal in 1907, General Botha was called upon by Lord Selborne to form a government, and in the spring of the same year he took part in the conference of colonial premiers held in London. During his visit to England on this occasion General Botha declared the whole-hearted adhesion of the Transvaal to the British Empire, and his intention to work for the welfare of the country regardless of (intra-white) racial differences (in this era referring to Boers/Afrikaners as a separate race to British South Africans).\n\nHe later worked towards peace with the British, representing the Boers at the peace negotiations in 1902. In the period of reconstruction under British rule, Botha went to Europe with de Wet and de la Rey to raise funds to enable the Boers to resume their former avocations. Botha, who was still looked upon as the leader of the Boer people, took a prominent part in politics, advocating always measures which he considered as tending to the maintenance of peace and good order and the re-establishment of prosperity in the Transvaal. His war record made him prominent in the politics of Transvaal and he was a major player in the postwar reconstruction of that country, becoming Prime Minister of Transvaal on 4 March 1907.\n\nIn 1911, together with another Boer war hero, Jan Smuts, he formed the South African Party, or SAP. Widely viewed as too conciliatory with Britain, Botha faced revolts from within his own party and opposition from James Barry Munnik Hertzog's National Party. He was a South African Freemason. When South Africa obtained dominion status in 1910, Botha became the first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa.\n\nAfter the First World War started, he sent troops to take German South-West Africa, a move unpopular among Boers, which provoked the Boer Revolt.\n\nAt the end of the War he briefly led a British Empire military mission to Poland during the Polish-Soviet War. He argued that the terms of the Versailles Treaty were too harsh on the Central Powers, but signed the treaty.\nBotha was unwell for most of 1919. He was plagued by fatigue and ill-health that arose from his robust waist-line. That he was fat is certain as related in the marvellous account of Lady Mildred Buxton asking General Van Deventer if he was bigger than Botha, to which Van Deventer replied: “I am longer, he is thicker.” (In Afrikaans thicker literally means fatter, and does not differentiate between long and tall)\n\nGeneral Louis Botha died of heart failure following an attack of Spanish influenza on 27 August 1919 in the early hours of the morning. His wife Annie was at home and was joined by Engelenburg who had acted as a private secretary to Botha. Botha was laid to rest in Heroes Acre Pretoria.\n\nOf Botha, Winston Churchill wrote in \"Great Contemporaries\", \"The three most famous generals I have known in my life won no great battles over a foreign foe. Yet their names, which all begin with a 'B', are household words. They are General Booth, General Botha and General Baden-Powell...\"\n\nSculptor Raffaello Romanelli created the equestrian statue of Botha that stands outside The Union Buildings in Pretoria in South Africa.\n\nA street in Amsterdam was named after Louis Botha at the beginning of the 20th century. Because the name was considered too reminiscent of pro-apartheid politician Pieter Willem Botha, the street was renamed after Albert Luthuli at an unclear date after 1986. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "320445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320445", "title": "Luis Walter Alvarez", "text": "Luis Walter Alvarez\n\nLuis Walter Alvarez (June 13, 1911 – September 1, 1988) was an American experimental physicist, inventor, and professor who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968. The American Journal of Physics commented, \"Luis Alvarez was one of the most brilliant and productive experimental physicists of the twentieth century.\"\n\nAfter receiving his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1936, Alvarez went to work for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley. Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed. He produced tritium using the cyclotron and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with Felix Bloch, he measured the magnetic moment of the neutron.\n\nIn 1940 Alvarez joined the MIT Radiation Laboratory, where he contributed to a number of World War II radar projects, from early improvements to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has played a major role in aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 \"The Great Artiste\".\n\nAfter the war Alvarez was involved in the design of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He was involved in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, he developed the Alvarez hypothesis which proposes that the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.\n\nAlvarez was a member of the JASON Defense Advisory Group, the Bohemian Club, and the Republican Party.\n\nLuis Walter Alvarez was born in San Francisco on June 13, 1911, the second child and oldest son of Walter C. Alvarez, a physician, and his wife Harriet née Smyth, and a grandson of Luis F. Álvarez, a physician who lived for a time in Spain, then Cuba, and finally the United States, who found a better method for diagnosing macular leprosy. He had an older sister, Gladys, a younger brother, Bob, and a younger sister, Bernice. His aunt, Mabel Alvarez, was a California artist specializing in oil painting.\n\nHe attended Madison School in San Francisco from 1918 to 1924, and then San Francisco Polytechnic High School. In 1926, his father became a researcher at the Mayo Clinic, and the family moved to Rochester, Minnesota, where Alvarez attended Rochester High School. He had always expected to attend the University of California, but at the urging of his teachers at Rochester, he instead went to the University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1932, his master's degree in 1934, and his PhD in 1936. As an undergraduate, he belonged to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. As a postgraduate he moved to Gamma Alpha.\n\nIn 1932, as a graduate student at Chicago, he discovered physics there and had the rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A. Michelson. Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and under the aegis of his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the \"Physical Review\", with Alvarez's name at the top.\n\nHe was an agnostic.\n\nAlvarez's sister, Gladys, worked for Ernest Lawrence as a part-time secretary, and mentioned Alvarez to Lawrence. Lawrence then invited Alvarez to tour the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago with him. After he completed his oral exams in 1936, Alvarez, now engaged to be married to Geraldine Smithwick, asked his sister to see if Lawrence had any jobs available at the Radiation Laboratory. A telegram soon arrived from Gladys with a job offer from Lawrence. This started a long association with the University of California, Berkeley. Alvarez and Smithwick were married in one of the chapels at the University of Chicago and then headed for California. They had two children, Walter and Jean. They were divorced in 1957. On December 28, 1958, he married Janet L. Landis, and had two more children, Donald and Helen.\n\nAt the Radiation Laboratory he worked with Lawrence's experimental team, which was supported by a group of theoretical physicists headed by Robert Oppenheimer. Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never observed. Using magnets to sweep aside the positrons and electrons emanating from his radioactive sources, he designed a special purpose Geiger counter to detect only the \"soft\" X-rays coming from K capture. He published his results in the Physical Review in 1937.\n\nWhen deuterium (hydrogen-2) is bombarded with deuterium, the fusion reaction yields either tritium (hydrogen-3) plus a proton or helium-3 plus a neutron (). This is one of the most basic fusion reactions, and the foundation of the thermonuclear weapon and the current research on controlled nuclear fusion. At that time the stability of these two reaction products was unknown, but based on existing theories Hans Bethe thought that tritium would be stable and helium-3 unstable. Alvarez proved the reverse by using his knowledge of the details of the 60-inch cyclotron operation. He tuned the machine to accelerate doubly ionized helium-3 nuclei and was able to get a beam of accelerated ions, thus using the cyclotron as a kind of super mass spectrometer. As the accelerated helium came from deep gas wells where it had been for millions of years, the helium-3 component had to be stable. Afterwards Alvarez produced the radioactive tritium using the cyclotron and the reaction and measured its lifetime.\n\nIn 1938, again using his knowledge of the cyclotron and inventing what are now known as time-of-flight techniques, Alvarez created a mono-energetic beam of thermal neutrons. With this he began a long series of experiments, collaborating with Felix Bloch, to measure the magnetic moment of the neutron. Their result of , published in 1940, was a major advance over earlier work.\n\nThe British Tizard Mission to the United States in 1940 demonstrated to leading American scientists the successful application of the cavity magnetron to produce short wavelength pulsed radar. The National Defense Research Committee, established only months earlier by President Franklin Roosevelt, created a central national laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the purpose of developing military applications of microwave radar. Lawrence immediately recruited his best \"cyclotroneers\", among them Alvarez, who joined this new laboratory, known as the Radiation Laboratory, on November 11, 1940. Alvarez contributed to a number of radar projects, from early improvements to Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars.\n\nOne of the first projects was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar made possible by the cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.\nThe radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has played a major role in aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Using Alvarez's dipole antenna to achieve a very high angular resolution, GCA allows ground-based radar operators watching special precision displays to guide a landing airplane to the runway by transmitting verbal commands to the pilot. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It was so successful that the military continued to use it for many years after the war, and it was still in use in some countries in the 1980s. Alvarez was awarded the National Aeronautic Association's Collier Trophy in 1945 \"for his conspicuous and outstanding initiative in the concept and development of the Ground Control Approach system for safe landing of aircraft under all weather and traffic conditions\".\n\nAlvarez spent the summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes returning from battle in bad weather, and also training the British in the use of the system. While there he encountered the young Arthur C. Clarke, who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station as the basis for his novel Glide Path, which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez. Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.\n\nIn the fall of 1943, Alvarez returned to the United States with an offer from Robert Oppenheimer to work at Los Alamos on the Manhattan project. But Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the University of Chicago working with Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General Leslie Groves asked Alvarez to think of a way that the US could find out if the Germans were operating any nuclear reactors, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly xenon 133. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring fission products for intelligence gathering. It would become extremely important after the war.\nAs a result of his radar work and the few months spent with Fermi, Alvarez arrived at Los Alamos in the spring of 1944, later than many of his contemporaries. The work on the \"Little Boy\" (a uranium bomb) was far along so Alvarez became involved in the design of the \"Fat Man\" (a plutonium bomb). The technique used for uranium, that of forcing the two sub-critical masses together using a type of gun, would not work with plutonium because the high level of background spontaneous neutrons would cause fissions as soon as the two parts approached each other, so heat and expansion would force the system apart before much energy has been released. It was decided to use a nearly critical sphere of plutonium and compress it quickly by explosives into a much smaller and denser core, a technical challenge at the time.\n\nTo create the symmetrical implosion required to compress the plutonium core to the required density, thirty two explosive charges were to be simultaneously detonated around the spherical core. Using conventional explosive techniques with blasting caps, progress towards achieving simultaneity to within a small fraction of a microsecond was discouraging. Alvarez directed his graduate student, Lawrence H. Johnston, to use a large capacitor to deliver a high voltage charge directly to each explosive lens, replacing blasting caps with exploding-bridgewire detonators. The exploding wire detonated the thirty two charges to within a few tenths of a microsecond. The invention was critical to the success of the implosion-type nuclear weapon. He also supervised the RaLa Experiments. Alvarez later wrote that:\n\nAgain working with Johnston, Alvarez's last task for the Manhattan Project was to develop a set of calibrated microphone/transmitters to be parachuted from an aircraft to measure the strength of the blast wave from the atomic explosion, so as to allow the scientists to calculate the bomb's energy. After being commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress that also carried fellow Project Alberta members Harold Agnew and Deak Parsons (who were respectively commissioned at the rank of captain).\n\nFlying in the B-29 Superfortress \"The Great Artiste\" in formation with the Enola Gay, Alvarez and Johnston measured the blast effect of the Little Boy bomb which was dropped on Hiroshima. A few days later, again flying in \"The Great Artiste\", Johnston used the same equipment to measure the strength of the Nagasaki explosion.\n\nReturning to the University of California as a full professor, Alvarez had many ideas about how to use his wartime radar knowledge to improve particle accelerators. Though some of these were to bear fruit, the \"big idea\" of this time would come from Edwin McMillan with his concept of phase stability which led to the synchrocyclotron. Refining and extending this concept, the Lawrence team would build the world's then-largest proton accelerator, the Bevatron, which began operating in 1954. Though the Bevatron could produce copious amounts of interesting particles, particularly in secondary collisions, these complex interactions were hard to detect and analyze at the time.\n\nSeizing upon a new development to visualize particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and known as a bubble chamber, Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it could be made to function with liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.\n\nThe Glaser device was a small glass cylinder () filled with ether. By suddenly reducing the pressure in the device, the liquid could be placed into a temporary superheated state, which would boil along the disturbed track of a particle passing through. Glaser was able to maintain the superheated state for a few seconds before spontaneous boiling took place. The Alvarez team built chambers of 1.5 in, 2.5 in, 4 in, 10 in, and 15 in using liquid hydrogen, and constructed of metal with glass windows, so that the tracks could be photographed. The chamber could be cycled in synchronization with the accelerator beam, a picture could be taken, and the chamber recompressed in time for the next beam cycle.\n\nThis program built a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber almost 7 feet (2 meters) long, employed dozens of physicists and graduate students together with hundreds of engineers and technicians, took millions of photographs of particle interactions, developed computer systems to measure and analyze the interactions, and discovered families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in the Nobel Prize in Physics for Alvarez in 1968, \"For his decisive contributions to elementary particle physics, in particular the discovery of a large number of resonant states, made possible through his development of the technique of using hydrogen bubble chambers and data analysis.\"\n\nIn 1964 Alvarez proposed what became known as the High Altitude Particle Physics Experiment (HAPPE), originally conceived as a large superconducting magnet carried to high altitude by a balloon in order to study extremely high-energy particle interactions. In time the focus of the experiment changed toward the study of cosmology and the role of both particles and radiation in the early universe. This work was a large effort, carrying detectors aloft with high-altitude balloon flights and high-flying U-2 aircraft, and an early precursor of the COBE satellite-born experiments on the cosmic background radiation (which resulted in the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize, shared by George Smoot and John Mather.)\nAlvarez proposed Muon tomography in 1965 to search the Egyptian pyramids for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the second pyramid of Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.\n\nAlvarez assembled a team of physicists and archeologists from the United States and Egypt, the recording equipment was constructed and the experiment carried out, though it was interrupted by the 1967 Six-Day War. Restarted after the war, the effort continued, recording and analyzing the penetrating cosmic rays until 1969 when Alvarez reported to the American Physical Society that no chambers had been found in the 19% of the pyramid surveyed.\n\nIn November 1966 \"Life\" published a series of photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could be learned from the film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.\n\nIn 1980 Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, along with nuclear chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, \"uncovered a calamity that literally shook the Earth and is one of the great discoveries about Earth's history\".\n\nDuring the 1970s, Walter Alvarez was doing geologic research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop on the walls of a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both above and below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.\n\nAlvarez had access to the nuclear chemists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was able to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the technique of neutron activation analysis. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.\n\nPublication of the 1980 paper brought criticism from the geologic community, and an often acrimonious scientific debate ensued. Ten years later, and after Alvarez's death, evidence of a large impact crater called Chicxulub was found off the coast of Mexico, providing support for the theory. Other researchers later found that the end-Cretaceous extinction of the dinosaurs may have occurred rapidly in geologic terms, over thousands of years, rather than millions of years as had previously been supposed. Others continue to study alternative extinction causes such as increased volcanism, particularly the massive Deccan Traps eruptions that occurred around the same time, and climate change, checking against the fossil record. However, on March 4, 2010, a panel of 41 scientists agreed that the Chicxulub asteroid impact triggered the mass extinction.\n\nIn his autobiography, Alvarez said, \"I think of myself as having had two separate careers, one in science and one in aviation. I've found the two almost equally rewarding.\" An important contributor to this was his enjoyment of flying. He learned to fly in 1933, later earning instrument and multi-engine ratings. Over the next 50 years he accumulated over 1000 hours of flight time, most of it as pilot in command. He said, \"I found few activities as satisfying as being pilot in command with responsibility for my passengers' lives.\"\n\nAlvarez made numerous professional contributions to aviation. During World War II he led the development of multiple aviation-related technologies. Several of his projects are described above, including Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) for which he was awarded the Collier Trophy in 1945. He also held the basic patent for the radar transponder, for which he assigned rights to the U.S. government for $1.\n\nLater in his career Alvarez served on multiple high level advisory committees related to civilian and military aviation. These included a Federal Aviation Administration task group on future air navigation and air traffic control systems, the President's Science Advisory Committee Military Aircraft Panel, and a committee studying how the scientific community could help improve the United States' capabilities for fighting a nonnuclear war.\n\nAlvarez's aviation responsibilities led to many adventures. For example, while working on GCA he became the first civilian to fly a low approach with his view outside the cockpit obstructed. He also flew many military aircraft from the co-pilot's seat, including a B-29 Superfortress and a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. In addition, he survived a crash during World War II as a passenger in a Miles Master.\n\nAlvarez died on September 1, 1988, due to complications from a succession of recent operations for cancer of the esophagus. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered over Monterey Bay. His papers are in The Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He passed the Provincial Exam during the reign of Guangxu Emperor, then he was appointed as Director of Mianzhu County Education Department. After several years, he started to work as a professor at Chengdu Governmental Institution and appointed as Supervisor of Gentry Class at the Political-Legal School. He advised students not only to learn specific knowledge but also to be useful to the society. Students were not used to doing gymnastics, so Meng served as an example in the courtyard. He was highly respected and called Mr. Gongfu (literally, Public Father Figure.)\n\nIn 1905, Sichuan Province established the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company. However, the company management was beset by corruption and mismanagement and construction effort made little progress. During August 1910, Sichuan Advisory Department started to run official newspaper \"Shu Gazette\" with the propaganda \"Overseeing Administration and Promoting Institutionalism\". Meng Caicheng was one of the sponsors of \"Shu Gazette\", which published articles about important political events and also disclosed the corruption and degeneration of the official class. The newspaper was forced to stop publication in July 1911.\n\non April 26, 1911, Wang Renwen, the Deputy Governor of Sichuan, presented a memorial to the Bureau of Civil Affairs. In the Memo, Wang reported that \"the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company representative stakeholder Meng Caicheng and others ever advised the Department to notify all the official business to government organs and the public. So they were running \"Sichuan Railway Monthly\" to publish all important issues about Sichuan Railway such as finance, accounting, construction and operation.\"\n\nOn May 9, 1911, the Qing authorities ordered the nationalization of all locally controlled railway signed a local agreement with Great Britain, Germany, France and the United States. The nationalization order drew strong opposition across Southern China, especially Sichuan. Pu Dianjun, Meng Caicheng and other influential members of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly organized the Railway Protection League on June 17, and made public speeches against the plan.\n\nOn August 2, Zhao Erfeng arrived Chengdu and took the post of the Governor-General of Sichuan. On September 7, Zhao Erfeng had Pu Dianjun, Luo Lun, Yan Kai and other leaders arrested and closed the company. Afterwards, Meng Caicheng asked the Governor Zhao Erfeng to have him arrested as well. As an appointed official by imperial government, Meng Caicheng was prisoned alone at Police Department.\n\nEnraged protestors marched on the Governor-General's office. Zhao Erfeng ordered troops to open fire and dozens of protestors were killed. Bloodshed further inflamed the protestors. Led by Tongmenghui, an armed revolution broke out all over Sichuan Province. On October 5, Zhao Erfeng released Meng Caicheng, Hu Rong and other leaders.\n\nThe Qing Court ordered Duan Fang, the Governor-General of Hubei and Hunan to reinforce Sichuan with troops from Hubei, which weakened defenses in Wuhan. On October 10, 1911, revolutionaries in the New Army units that remained in Wuhan launched the Wuchang Uprising. On November 14, Zhao Erfeng released Pu Dianjun from prison and negotiated established Great Han Military Government of Sichuan.

Mike, a vagabond searching for his mother, proclaims himself as a \"connoisseur of roads\" because he has been \"tasting roads all [his] life.\" \n\nMikey remains one of the defining characters of New Queer Cinema and, due to the impressive critical reception, is a crucial role in River Phoenix's success and influence as an actor. For example, Eric Alan Edwards, one of the film's directors of photography, said that River Phoenix \"really wore the role\" because \"he looked like a street kid.\"\n\nRoger Ebert characterizes Mikey as someone who \"wants...love and by love what he really means is someone to hold him and care for him. He was deeply damaged as a child, and now he seeks shelter; it is a matter of indifference whether he finds it with a man or a woman.\" \"The New York Times\" called Mikey \"good-looking, none-too-bright...hapless...hustler\" is \"the product of a dramatically dysfunctional family\" and who, due to his narcolepsy, is often \"overwhelmed by sleep.\" \"The Washington Post\" praised Phoenix's approach to Mikey's character claiming that he \"brings an extraordinary quality of comic pathos to his character..he slouches through the movie, a walking blur, seemingly only half awake, but fully engaged.\" \"Newsweek\" praised Phoenix's performance in the campfire scene, saying that \"in this, and every scene, Phoenix immerses himself so deeply inside his character you almost forget you've seen him before: it's a stunningly sensitive performance, poignant and comic at once.\"\n\nMark Adnum calls Mikey \"a one-man gay Hall of Fame...hustler outlaw, a cigarette constantly in mouth, living on cola and amphetamines\" who is \"even dressed as a Dutch sailor at one point, replete with Querelle’s pom-pom hat\" and also \"keeps an elastic umbilical cord to his Midwestern home which he occasionally visits but can no longer relate to.\" \n\nIn \"New Queer White Cinema,\" Daniel Mudie Cunningham claims that Mike exists on the margins of society, outside conventional employment, and beyond the social institutions of marriage and family.\" Mike, Cunningham writes, is \"queer white trash\" while Scott Favor, is \"gay for cash.\" In this way, Mike is an unlikely character to be the protagonist of the film—he is queer, white, homeless, relatively passive, and disabled. Thus, \"My Own Private Idaho\" presented a new, complex type of hero.\n\nThe film is characterized by Mikey's \"internal actions.\" Throughout the film, the audience is \"presented with brief clips which indicate his thoughts and feelings.\" The timeless quality of the film—a mixture of flashbacks, flash-forwards, and the present—is due to Mike's narcolepsy and subsequent memory loss as well as the persistent yearning he has for his childhood.\n\nPhoenix won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 1991 Venice Film Festival for his role as Mikey.

In addition to the already established Jumo 004 and BMW 003 engines they brought along the design documents and plans of Jumo 022 project.\n\nIn 1949, Kuznetsov was appointed as chief designer of jet engines at OKB-276 (\"Experimental design bureau-276\") and started developing turboprop designs further with the help of the German specialists.\n\nIt proved to be a successful engine and was completed in 1955. The new turboprop engine, named Kuznetsov NK-12, displayed great performance and was developed up to 11,000 kW. It was used in the Antonov An-22 aircraft, A-90 Orlyonok Ekranoplane and the Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber among others. The later models produced around 15,000 kW.\n\nIn 1954, he began work on a two-flow jet engine with afterburner, called the Kuznetsov NK-6, which was never completed.\n\nIn 1957, he received the Order of Hero of Socialist Labor for his contributions.\n\nFrom 1959 onwards, he was also involved in the development of engines for the projected Soviet N1 moon rocket. The primary engines for the development rockets were Kuznetsov NK-15 and Kuznetsov NK-15V (later developed into Kuznetsov NK-33 and Kuznetsov NK-43). Ultimately, these designs were successful but arrived too late. By the time the bugs in this very advanced design, which to this day has the highest thrust to weight ratio of any liquid fuel rocket engine ever produced were rectified, the N1 rocket program had been cancelled. The S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia now manufactures RD-180 engines, based on the NK-15, for Atlas V rockets, under contract to United Launch Alliance.\n\nIn the 1960s he developed aircraft engines specifically for the world's first supersonic transport aircraft to fly Tupolev Tu-144, the Kuznetsov NK-144 turbofan. This was however inefficient and replaced by a Kolesov turbojet.\n\nBased on these design experiences, the engine Kuznetsov NK-321 (also known as NK-32-1) was developed later for the supersonic, variable-geometry heavy bomber Tupolev Tu-160, which is also in the more powerful version of the Tupolev Tu-144 (version Tu-144LL).\n\nIn the late 1980s OKB- 267 began the development of the fuel sipping Turbo Fan Engine Kuznetsov NK-93, which has a by-pass ratio of almost 17:1 and thus an engine of a unique design in the world.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23739", "title": "Peter Duesberg", "text": "Peter Duesberg\n\nPeter H. Duesberg (born December 2, 1936) is a German American molecular biologist and a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley. He is known for his early research into genetic aspects of cancer, and more recently for his central role in the AIDS denialism movement as a proponent of the belief that HIV is harmless and does not cause AIDS. Duesberg received acclaim early in his career for research on oncogenes and cancer. With Peter K. Vogt, he reported in 1970 that a cancer-causing virus of birds had extra genetic material compared with non-cancer-causing viruses, hypothesizing that this material contributed to cancer. At the age of 36, Duesberg was awarded tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, and at 49 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He received an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1986, and from 1986 to 1987 was a Fogarty Scholar-in-Residence at the NIH laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nLong considered a contrarian by his scientific colleagues, Duesberg began to gain public notoriety with a March 1987 article in \"Cancer Research\" entitled \"Retroviruses as Carcinogens and Pathogens: Expectations and Reality\". In this and subsequent writings, Duesberg proposed his hypothesis that AIDS is caused by long-term consumption of recreational drugs or antiretroviral drugs, and that HIV is a harmless passenger virus. In contrast, the scientific consensus is that HIV infection causes AIDS; Duesberg's HIV/AIDS claims have been addressed and rejected as erroneous by the scientific community. Reviews of his opinions in \"Nature\" and \"Science\" asserted that they were unpersuasive and based on selective reading of the literature, and that although Duesberg had a right to a dissenting opinion, his failure to fairly review evidence that HIV causes AIDS meant that his opinion lacked credibility.\n\nDuesberg's views are cited as major influences on South African HIV/AIDS policy under the administration of Thabo Mbeki, which embraced AIDS denialism. Duesberg served on an advisory panel to Mbeki, convened in 2000. The Mbeki administration's failure to provide antiretroviral drugs in a timely manner, due in part to the influence of AIDS denialism, is thought to be responsible for hundreds of thousands of preventable AIDS deaths and HIV infections in South Africa. Duesberg disputed these findings in an article in the journal \"Medical Hypotheses\", but the journal's publisher, Elsevier, later retracted Duesberg's article over accuracy and ethics concerns as well as its rejection during peer review. The incident prompted several complaints to Duesberg's institution, the University of California, Berkeley, which began a misconduct investigation of Duesberg in 2009. The investigation was dropped in 2010, with University officials finding \"insufficient evidence...to support a recommendation for disciplinary action.\"\n\nDuesberg grew up during World War II, raised as a Catholic in Germany. He moved to Berkeley, California, in 1964 to work at the University of California, Berkeley, following completion of a PhD in chemistry at the University of Frankfurt.\n\nIn the 1970s Duesberg won international acclaim for his groundbreaking work on cancer. Duesberg's early work on cancer included being the first to identify the oncogene \"v-src\" from the genome of Rous sarcoma virus, a chicken virus believed to trigger tumor growth.\n\nDuesberg disputes the importance of oncogenes and retroviruses in cancer. He supports the aneuploidy hypothesis of cancer that was first proposed in 1914 by Theodor Heinrich Boveri.\n\nDuesberg rejects the importance of mutations, oncogenes, and anti-oncogenes entirely. Duesberg along with other researchers, in a 1998 paper published in \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\", reported a mathematical correlation between chromosome number and the genetic instability of cancer cells, which they dubbed \"the ploidy factor,\" confirming earlier research by other groups that demonstrated an association between degree of aneuploidy and metastasis. Although unwilling to concur with Duesberg in throwing out a role for cancer genes, many researchers do support exploration of alternative hypotheses. Research and debate on this subject is ongoing. In 2007, \"Scientific American\" published an article by Duesberg on his aneuploidy cancer theory. In an editorial explaining their decision to publish this article, the editors of \"Scientific American\" stated: \"Thus, as wrong as Duesberg surely is about HIV, there is at least a chance that he is significantly right about cancer.\"\n\nIn his 1996 book \"Inventing the AIDS Virus\" and in numerous journal articles and letters to the editor, Duesberg asserts that HIV is harmless and that recreational and pharmaceutical drug use, especially of zidovudine (AZT, a drug used in the treatment of AIDS) are the causes of AIDS outside Africa (the so-called Duesberg hypothesis). He considers AIDS diseases as markers for drug use, e.g. use of poppers (alkyl nitrites) among some homosexuals, asserting a correlation between AIDS and recreational drug use. This correlation hypothesis has been disproven by evidence showing that only HIV infection, not homosexuality nor recreational/pharmaceutical drug use, predicts who will develop AIDS.\n\nDuesberg asserts that AIDS in Africa is misdiagnosed and the epidemic a \"myth\", claiming incorrectly that the diagnostic criteria for AIDS are different in Africa than elsewhere and that the breakdown of the immune system in African AIDS patients can be explained exclusively by factors such as malnutrition, tainted drinking water, and various infections that he presumes are common to AIDS patients in Africa. Duesberg also argues that retroviruses like HIV must be harmless to survive, and that the normal mode of retroviral propagation is mother-to-child transmission by infection in utero.\n\nSince Duesberg published his first paper on the subject in 1987, scientists have examined and criticized the accuracy of his hypotheses on AIDS causation. Duesberg sustained a long dispute with John Maddox, then-editor of the scientific journal \"Nature\", demanding the right to rebut articles that HIV caused AIDS. For several years Maddox consented to this demand but ultimately refused to continue to publish Duesberg's criticisms:\nA number of scientific criticisms of Duesberg's hypothesis were summarized in a review article in the journal \"Science\" in 1994, which presented the results of a 3-month scientific investigation into some of Duesberg's claims. In the \"Science\" article, science writer Jon Cohen interviewed both HIV researchers and AIDS denialists (including Duesberg himself) and examined the AIDS literature in addition to review articles written by Duesberg. The article stated:\nThe article also stated that although Duesberg and the AIDS denialist movement have garnered support from some prominent scientists, including Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis, most of this support is related to Duesberg's right to hold a dissenting opinion, rather than support of his specific claim that HIV does not cause AIDS. Duesberg has been described as \"the individual who has done the most damage\" regarding denialism, due to the apparent scientific legitimacy his scientific credentials give to his statements.\n\nIn a 2010 article on conspiracy theories in science, Ted Goertzel highlights Duesberg's opposition to the HIV/AIDS connection as an example in which scientific findings are disputed on irrational grounds, relying on rhetoric, appeal to fairness and the right to a dissenting opinion rather than on evidence. Goertzel stated that Duesberg, along with many other denialists frequently invoke the meme of a \"courageous independent scientist resisting orthodoxy\", invoking the name of persecuted physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei. Regarding this comparison, Goertzel stated:\nDuesberg's advocacy of AIDS denialism has, by all accounts, effectively made him a pariah to the worldwide scientific community.\n\nIn 2000, Duesberg was the most prominent AIDS denialist to sit on a 44-member Presidential Advisory Panel on HIV and AIDS convened by then-president Thabo Mbeki of South Africa. The panel was scheduled to meet concurrently with the 2000 International AIDS Conference in Durban and to convey the impression that Mbeki's doubts about HIV/AIDS science were valid and actively discussed in the scientific community. The views of the denialists on the panel, aired during the AIDS conference, received renewed attention. Mbeki later suffered substantial political fallout for his support for AIDS denialism and for opposing the treatment of pregnant HIV-positive South African women with antiretroviral medication. Mbeki partly attenuated his ties with denialists in 2002, asking them to stop associating their names with his.\n\nIn response to the inclusion of AIDS denialists on Mbeki's panel, the Durban Declaration was drafted and signed by over 5,000 scientists and physicians, describing the evidence that HIV causes AIDS as \"clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous\".\n\nTwo independent studies have concluded that the public health policies of Thabo Mbeki's government, shaped in part by Duesberg's writings and advice, were responsible for over 330,000 excess AIDS deaths and many preventable infections, including those of infants.\n\nA 2008 feature story on Duesberg in \"Discover\" addresses Duesberg's role in anti-HIV drug-preventable deaths in South Africa. Jeanne Linzer interviews prominent HIV/AIDS expert Max Essex, who suggests that,\nIn 2009, Duesberg and co-authors including David Rasnick published an article in the journal \"Medical Hypotheses\", which is not peer reviewed. The article had been rejected previously by the journal \"JAIDS\", and a peer reviewer had warned that the authors could face scientific misconduct charges if the paper were published.\n\nThe reviewers claimed that Duesberg and his co-authors cherry-picked data, cited favorable results while ignoring unfavorable results, and quoted statements out of context. Moreover, they claim that Duesberg \"[committed] a serious breach of professional ethics\" by failing to state a possible conflict of interest: That co-author Rasnick previously worked for Matthias Rath, a vitamin entrepreneur who sold vitamin pills as AIDS remedies. The article was not revised in response to these criticisms.\n\nIn the article, Duesberg questioned research reporting that drugs policies implemented by the South African government on the advice of Duesberg, Rasnick and others had led to excess AIDS deaths. Observing that the overall population of South Africa has increased, Duesberg claimed that HIV must be a harmless \"passenger virus\" that has not caused deaths in South Africa or elsewhere. Duesberg stated that HIV does not replicate in the body and that antiviral drugs, which he calls \"inevitably toxic\", do not inhibit HIV. In addition, Duesberg wrote that neither he nor his co-authors had financial conflicts of interest.\n\nScientists expressed concerns to Elsevier, the publisher of \"Medical Hypotheses\", about unsupported assertions and incorrect statements by Duesberg. After an internal review and with a unanimous recommendation of rejection by five \"Lancet\" reviewers, Elsevier stated that the article was flawed and of potential danger to global public health. Elsevier permanently withdrew the Duesberg article and another AIDS denialist publication and asked that the editor of the journal implement a peer review process.\n\nLetters of complaint to the University of California, Berkeley, including one from Nathan Geffen of the South African Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), prompted university officials to open an inquiry into possible academic misconduct related to false statements and failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest. The investigation was dropped in 2010, with University officials finding \"insufficient evidence...to support a recommendation for disciplinary action.\" The investigation did not evaluate the merits of the research but found that publishing the article was protected by the principle of academic freedom.\n\n\n"}

He had two sons, Charles Arthur Tristan Languedoc de Noailles and Just de Noailles.\n\nIn 1789 he was elected to the Estates-General by the \"noblesse\" of Amiens and Ham, but was compelled to resign in consequence of a duel with the commander of the National Guard of Versailles.\n\nHe left the country for some time, but returned to France and took part in the riots of August, 1792. He was, however, forced to quit the country once more to evade the fate of his father and mother, guillotined in 1794. On his father's death, he acceded \"à brevêt\" to the titles of \"comte de Noailles\" and \"duc de Poix\", as well as to the Spanish title \"duc de Mouchy\".\n\nReturning to France in 1800, with the amnesty of Émigrés, he lived quietly at his residence in Mouchy-le-Châtel (Oise) during the Empire.

On September 11, 2001, Suqami boarded American Airlines Flight 11 and participated in the hijacking of the plane so that it could be crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the coordinated attacks.\n\nA native of the Saudi Arabian city of Riyadh, Suqami was a law student at the King Saud University. While there he joined a (possible) former roommate named Majed Moqed in training for al-Qaida at Khalden, a large training facility near Kabul that was run by Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi. In November 2000, the two flew into Iran from Bahrain together.\n\nThe FBI says Suqami first arrived in the U.S. on April 23, 2001, with a visa that allowed him to remain in the country until May 21. However, at least five residents of the \"Spanish Trace Apartments\" claim to recognize the photographs of both Suqami and Salem al-Hazmi as living in the San Antonio complex earlier in 2001. However, these residents and several others who claim to have known the hijackers, claim that the FBI photographs of Suqami and Hazmi are reversed. Other reports conflictingly suggested that Suqami was staying with Waleed al-Shehri in Hollywood, Florida and rented a black Toyota Corolla from Alamo Rent-A-Car agency.\n\nOn May 19, Suqami and Waleed al-Shehri took a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Freeport, Bahamas where they had reservations at the \"Princess Resort\". Lacking proper documentation however, they were stopped upon landing, and returned to Florida the same day and rented a red Kia Rio from Avis Rent-A-Car agency.\n\nHe was one of nine hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001, and on July 3 he was issued a Florida State Identification Card. Around this time, he also used his Saudi license to gain a Florida drivers' license bearing the same home address as Wail al-Shehri. (A Homing Inn in Boynton Beach). Despite this, the 9/11 Commission claims that Suqami was the only hijacker to not have any US identification.\n\nDuring the summer, Suqami and both Wail and Waleed al-Shehri purchased one month passes to a Boynton Beach gym owned by Jim Woolard. (Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi also reportedly trained at a gym owned by Woolard, in Delray Beach.)\n\nKnown as \"Azmi\" during the preparations, Suqami was called one of the \"muscle\" hijackers, who were not expected to act as pilots. CIA director George Tenet later said that they \"probably were told little more than that they were headed for a suicide mission inside the United States.\"\n\nOn September 10, 2001, Suqami shared a room at the Milner Hotel in Boston with three of the Flight 175 hijackers, Marwan al-Shehhi, Fayez Banihammad, and Mohand al-Shehri.\n\nOn the day of the attacks, Suqami checked in at the flight desk using his Saudi passport, and boarded American Airlines Flight 11. At Logan International Airport, he was selected by CAPPS, which required his checked bags to undergo extra screening for explosives and involved no extra screening at the passenger security checkpoint.\n\nAn FAA memo, circulated in February 2002, claimed that Suqami shot passenger Daniel M. Lewin (Seat 9B), co-founder of Akamai Technologies and a former member of the Israeli Sayeret Matkal, for attempting to foil the hijacking. While based on the frantic phonecall received from a stewardess of the flight, the report has been a matter of some controversy, since both the FAA and FBI have strongly denied the presence of firearms or guns smuggled aboard. It is now believed that Suqami stabbed Lewin as he attempted to intervene in the hijacking.\n\nSuqami's passport was reportedly found by a passerby (identity unknown), reportedly in the vicinity of Vesey Street, before the towers collapsed. (This was mistakenly reported by many news outlets to be Mohamed Atta's passport.) A columnist for the British newspaper \"The Guardian\" expressed incredulity about the authenticity of this report, questioning whether a paper passport could survive the inferno unsinged when the plane's black boxes were never found. According to testimony before the 9/11 Commission by lead counsel Susan Ginsburg, his passport had been \"manipulated in a fraudulent manner in ways that have been associated with al Qaeda.\" Passports belonging to Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi were found at the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 as well as an airphone.\n\nSuqami and fellow hijacker Ahmed al-Ghamdi were both tied to a foiled plot to blow up several tourist sites.\n\n\n"}

McFadden has won 17 Paralympic medals in multiple Summer Paralympic Games.\n\nMcFadden was born in Leningrad, then Soviet Union, on 21 April 1989.\nShe was born with spina bifida, a congenital disorder that paralyzed her from the waist down. After her birth mother abandoned her in an orphanage that was too poor to afford a wheelchair for her, she walked on her hands for the first six years of her life. The doctors told her she was so sick that she had very little time to live. While in the orphanage, she met Deborah McFadden, who was visiting Russia as a commissioner of disabilities for the U.S. Health Department. Deborah and her partner Bridget O'Shaughnessy adopted Tatyana and took her to live in Baltimore.\n\nMcFadden took up a variety of sports while growing up to strengthen her muscles: first swimming, then gymnastics, wheelchair basketball, sled hockey and track and field. McFadden attended the University of Illinois studying for a degree in Human Development and Family Studies, was a member of the Theta chapter of Phi Sigma Sigma, and was on the University of Illinois Wheelchair Basketball team.\n\nMcFadden began racing at the age of eight. Competing in the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece, she won a silver medal in the women's 100 metres – T54 event; a bronze medal in the women's 200 metres – T54 event; finished fifth in the women's 400 metres – T54 event; and went out in the first round of the women's 800 metres – T54 event. She also competed at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China, where she won a silver medal in the women's 200 metres – T54 event; a silver medal in the women's 400 metres – T54 event; a silver medal in the women's 800 metres – T54 event; a bronze medal in the women's 4 x 100 metre relay – T53-54 event; and finished sixth in the women's 100 metres – T54 event.\n\nUntil 2009, McFadden specialized in shorter distance sprints. She entered the Chicago Marathon in 2009 as a lark. Unexpectedly, she won, finishing so soon that her mother didn't have her camera ready to record the victory. That was the first of a series of marathon victories for her, including New York City in 2010, Chicago in 2011, London in 2011, and Boston and New York in 2015.\n\nMcFadden's coach at the University of Illinois is Adam Bleakney, himself a veteran wheelchair racer.\n\nTatyana and her sister Hannah McFadden competed in the same Paralympic final (100m – T54 in London 2012).\n\nMcFadden became the first athlete to win six gold medals at a championships during the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon. She claimed gold in every event from the 100 meters through to the 5,000 meters. McFadden also won the Boston, Chicago, London, and New York marathons in 2013. This made her the first person – able-bodied or otherwise – to win the four major marathons in the same year. She also set a new course record for the Chicago Marathon (1 hour, 42 minutes, 35 seconds).\n\nMcFadden began 2014 by returning to the country of her birth, Russia, to compete in the Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi. After winning silver medal in the Sprint sitting cross-country skiing event; McFadden claimed she was \"fulfilled\" after winning the medal in front of all of her family including her biological mother. McFadden finished in 5th place in the Women's . Just over a month after Sochi, McFadden returned to wheelchair racing at the London Marathon, where she successfully defended her title in a new course record time.\n\nIn 2015 McFadden won the NYC marathon, and broke its women's course record by seven minutes and 20 seconds (her time was 1 hour, 43 minutes and four seconds).\n\nOn October 8, 2017 McFadden won the Bank of America Chicago Marathon.\n\nOn April 16, 2018, McFadden won the 122nd Boston Marathon.\n\nMcFadden had difficulty competing at high school. Atholton High School would not allow her to race at the same time as able-bodied runners, with officials saying her racing chair created a safety hazard and gave her an unfair advantage (as the best wheelchair racers are noticeably faster than runners over long distances). She competed in separate wheelchair events at high school meets, meaning that she would circle around an otherwise empty track by herself, which embarrassed her. In 2005 Tatyana and Deborah McFadden filed suit against the Howard County Public School System and won the right for her to race at the same time as the runners starting in 2006, though her score would not be counted for her team.\n\nHer legal victory led to its own controversies, though. In 2006, one of her Atholton teammates lost her victory in the 1600 meters at the state championships after McFadden was ruled to have been acting as a \"pacer\" for her, by encouraging her rather than racing on her own. And in 2008, McFadden collided with a rival runner from Bishop McNamara High School after a 200-meter race, inflicting bruises and cuts to the runner's legs and making her miss her conference title meet from the injuries.\n\nMcFadden's lawsuit is credited for the eventual passage of the Maryland Fitness and Athletics Equity for Students with Disabilities Act, requiring schools to give students with disabilities the opportunity to compete in interscholastic athletics.\n\nShe was also a leader of an ultimately unsuccessful effort against a 2012 Russian law to prohibit adoptions of Russian children by American parents.\n\n\n"}

Later he joined the board of directors at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, one of the organizations which fights against the spread of the disease in the city.\n\nTomas made significant contributions to AIDS activism during his time with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. In 1990, he was a major contributor in the creation of a multilingual newsletter for HIV-positive people. That same year he was elected to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation's board of Directors as well as the Healing Alternatives Foundation's Board of Directors.\n\nIn 1992 he attended the AIDS International Conference in Amsterdam on behalf of the above-mentioned organisation. At that time the US Government passed a law which banned entry to HIV positive people into the country. Fábregas disclosed his HIV status publicly at the conference and announced he was to challenge the Bush (senior) administration to detain him at the border. But the law was never applied. Upon his arrival at the San Francisco airport, he was welcomed by several AIDS activists.\n\nThe San Francisco AIDS Candlelight Vigil grants its annual ´Tomás Fábregas Awards´ to reward AIDS activists.\n\nFurthermore, his involvement in this cause was acknowledged by UNESCO and the San Francisco City Hall.\n\nThe Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society of San Francisco currently has printed material about Tomás for safekeeping. It consists of six boxes of documents donated by Tomás's partner, Jeffrey L. Brooks.\n\nThe \"Coruña Visible\" festival (held in November 2008) was dedicated to Tomás as well as Marcela y Elisa, two women who married in A Coruña in 1901, under the identities of Marcela y \"Mario\".\n\n"}
