The flag from each team was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the National Olympic Committee or by the athletes themselves to represent their country. Unlike the usual practice, the parade of nations was organized according to the English alphabet instead of host nation's language, Japanese. Greece led the parade, followed by Andorra. Had the parade followed the Japanese characters, Greece would have been followed by Iceland, and Russia would have been the penultimate country before Japan. One sumo wrestler and one \"yukiko\" (\"lit.\" snow children) which bears a country name sign marched before each delegation. Some of famous sumo wrestlers such as Takanonami and Wakanohana accompanied the teams. The \"yukikos\" also took part in several other segments in the ceremony.\n\n"}

Judith was sentenced to death in 1983, but her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1999. She is serving her sentence at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka, Alabama. Alvin was serving a life sentence at the Bostick State Prison in Hardwick, Georgia at the time of his death in 2005.\n\nAlvin Howard Neelley, Jr., was born in 1953 in Georgia, where he was a car thief during his teenage years. He met his second wife, Judith Ann Adams, when he was 26 years old and she was 15. Alvin divorced his first wife shortly before eloping with Judith in 1980.\n\nJudith Ann Adams was born in Murfeesboro, Tennessee, on June 7, 1964. Her father, an alcoholic, died in a motorcycle accident when she was nine. After meeting Neelley, she began her life of crime, committing armed robbery across the country (even when heavily pregnant) for which she was later caught. She gave birth to twins while incarcerated at Rome, Georgia's Youth Development Center.\n\nOn September 11, 1982, Ken Dooley, a Youth Development Center employee, was shot at four times. The following day, fellow employee Linda Adair's home was firebombed with a Molotov cocktail. Phone calls were made to the victims following the attacks by a female who claimed to have been sexually abused at the YDC, but neither victim could identify the caller's voice.\n\nLisa Ann Millican, a 13-year-old girl from Cedartown, Georgia, was abducted by the Neelleys from Rome's Riverbend Mall on September 25, 1982. She was taken to a motel in Scottsboro, Alabama, where the couple held her captive. During her captivity, Lisa was raped by both Neelleys multiple times. On September 28, Judith injected Lisa with Drano, first into one side, and later into both sides of her neck, both arms, and both buttocks in an attempt to poison her to death. Liquid Plumber was also used on some of the injections. When the painful poisoning failed to kill her, Lisa was shot in the back execution-style by Judith. Her body thrown over a cliff in the Little River Canyon in Fort Payne, Alabama. Judith later called various police agencies several times to report the location of Lisa's body, where it was found on the canyon floor draped over a fallen tree.\n\nJanice Chatman and John Hancock were a young engaged couple from Rome. On October 4, 1982, they were abducted by Judith. Hancock was shot while Chatman was abducted and brought back to the Neelleys' motel room, where she was tortured and murdered. Hancock, however, survived the shooting and was able to identify the Neelleys as his assailants.\n\nJudith was arrested on October 9, 1982, and Alvin was taken into custody a few days later. Judith was deduced as being the perpetrator in the YDC attacks. To avoid the death penalty, Alvin pleaded guilty to murder and aggravated assault in Georgia. He was not tried for the Millican murder.\n\nJudith's trial began on March 7, 1983, in Fort Payne. Before her trial, however, she gave birth to a third child behind bars. Judith was ultimately convicted of the torture murder of Lisa Ann Millican. Despite a jury's recommendation to sentence Judith to life in prison, Judge Randall Cole sentenced the 18-year-old mother of three to death in Alabama's electric chair. After her conviction, Judith pleaded guilty to Chatman's murder.\n\nAlvin was incarcerated at the Bostick State Prison from 1983 until his death in October 2005.\n\nAt 18-years-old, Judith became the youngest woman sentenced to death in the U.S. She was placed on Alabama's death row, at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women. Judith appealed for a new trial, but it was denied in March 1987. In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed her death sentence. On January 15, 1999, Judith was days from her execution date when Governor Fob James commuted her sentence to life in prison with a possibility of parole in another 15 years (thus, a minimum of 31 years in prison). The decision was met with controversy, but Gov. James – long known for his \"tough\" position on crime – cited the jury's recommendation for Judith's sentencing. Judith would have been eligible for parole in January 2014, at age 49, but the Alabama legislature passed a law in 2003 that made her ineligible.\n\nOn February 28, 2008, the Neelleys' case was profiled on the Investigation Discovery (ID) program \"Most Evil\". On a scale developed by forensic psychiatrist Michael Stone, Judith was ranked as a category 22 killer, the \"most evil\" level deemed for serial torture murderers. The Neelleys were later featured on the ID programs \"Wicked Attraction\" and \"Deadly Women\".\n"}

His sister Philadelphia Rowley was married to Admiral Sir Charles Cotton.\n\nRowley attended Harrow School from 1775, and then entered in the Navy. By 1780 was serving as a lieutenant aboard his father's flagship, the 74-gun . On 31 January 1781 he was made post (before his 17th birthday!) in order to command the 28-gun sixth-rate frigate .

{"id": "31961763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31961763", "title": "Biography in literature", "text": "Biography in literature\n\nWhen studying literature, biography and its relationship to literature is often a subject of literary criticism, and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use biography or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: literary biography and biographical criticism. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, biographical fiction and autobiographical fiction.\n\nA literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography. Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself. Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative. This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through psychoanalytic theory.\n\nLiterary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of Wilfrid Blunt, noted, \"Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use.\" However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, \"Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends.\"\n\nWell-received literary biographies include Richard Ellmann's \"James Joyce\" and George Painter's \"Marcel Proust\".\n\nBiographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.\n\nBiographical fiction is a type of historical fiction that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for \"truthful\" representation is less strict than in biography. \n\nThe various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like Gore Vidal's \"Lincoln\". Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as Malcolm Bradbury's \"To the Hermitage\" and Michael Cunningham's \"The Hours\". No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.\n\nBiographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people, but without direct reference to them, such as George Meredith's \"Diana of the Crossways\" (1885) and Somerset Maugham's \"The Moon and Sixpence\" (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.\n\nAutobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.\n\n"}

The earth-bound duties of such a scholar would be to disperse or impart knowledge to good students. If he did not do so, he would turn into a Brahma Rakshasa after death which is a very fierce demonic spirit. The word \"Brahma\" means Brahmin and Rakshasa, a demon. As per ancient Hindu texts they are powerful demon spirit, who have lot of powers and only few in this world can fight and over-come them or give them salvation from this form of life. It would still retain its high level of learning. But it would eat human beings. They have the knowledge of their past lives and vedas and puranas. In other words, they have qualities of both Brahmin and Rakshasa.\n\nIt is said that the 7th century Sanskrit poet Mayurbhatta, who composed the noted Surya Sataka (one hundred verses in praise of Lord Surya) was troubled by Brahmarakshasha. He was doing penance at famous Deo Sun Temple located at Aurangabad district of Bihar. Brahmarakshas was living in the Peepal tree under which Mayurbhatta was doing penance and creating the verses. It was repeating the verses pronounced by Mayurbhatta, disturbing him. In order to defeat him Mayurbhatta started to pronounce words through nose. Since Brahmarakshasas or other spirits do not have a nose it was defeated and left the tree, which immediately turned dry. After the spirit left Mayurbhatta could peacefully create the hundred verses in praise of Surya, which cured him of leprosy.\n\nBrahma-Rakshas were a regular feature in old Indian stories like Simhasana Dvatrimsika, Panchatantra and other old wives tales. As per these stories, Brahma-Rakshas, were powerful enough also to grant any boon, money, gold, if they became pleased with any person. In most of the stories, they are depicted as huge, mean and fierce looking having two horns on head like a Rakshas and a Choti like a Brahmin and usually found hanging upside down on a tree. Also a Brahma Rakshas would sometimes eat human beings in stories.\n\nIn many Hindu temples, especially in Central India like Maharashtra and South India like Kerala and Karnataka you can find idols of Brahm Rakshas in outer walls and are generally offered pooja, respects and an oil lamp is lit on regular basis in front of their idols. There are many temples, where they are also worshiped as demi-gods, like in Malliyor Temple of Kottayam District of Kerala, it is customary to take permission from Brahma Rakshas before commencing the construction activities. Further, at Thirunakkara Shiva Temple also in Kottayam in Kerala, there is a separate temple for Brahm Rakshasa. There is an interesting story about why the Brahma Rakshas temple was built here. One person called Moose was a great friend of the king. The king was not known for his beauty but his friend Moose, was very handsome. The queen fell in love with this friend knowing which the king ordered his servants to kill Moose. Instead of killing him the King’s servants killed the junior priest of the temple (keezh Santhi). The wife of the priest became a Brahma Rakshas and started troubling every body. So the king built a temple for her. For a long time afterward women did not prefer to enter this temple. Further, it is said that at Madikeri the Omkareshwar Shiva temple was built by king to ward of evil caused by Brahm-Rakshasa. At Shringeri, the Malayala Brahma Temple is of a Brahma-Raskshas. Similarly, there is separate temple for Brahma Raksha within complex of famous Kandiyoor Shiva Temple near Mavelikkara.In Njarakkal in Kerala there is an 800-year-old Bhagavathi temple where the other temples include Shiva, Nagaraja, and \"Sree Brahmarakshas\".\n\nThere are different plays like Kaisika Natakam in South India where artist play role of Brham-Rakshas.\n\nFurther, there are mention of Brahma-Rakshas also in Jainism in their scripts and stories.\n\nIn countries like Thailand, Cambodia and also Java whose culture has large influence of Hindu heritage and Sanskrit language, we can find little shrines elevated on poles. These are erected in neighborhood of every house in veneration of nature spirit. These spirits were identified in early times with Hindu deities or Sanskrit names like Brahmarakshsa, Sri Shikeshwara (Shiva), Sri Champeshwara (Krishna) and others.\n\nIn 2014, Vikram Bhatt, has made India's first 3D creature horror film, titled 'Creature 3D', in which his creature or demon is a Brahmarakshas - a mutant from Indian mythology. However, his demon who is a Brahma Rakshas, will not be a copy of its ancient Idol, in order to avoid hurting any religious sentiments. Due to this, Vikram Bhatt came up with his own imaginative take on the creature by using special effects in this film. In the film the Brahmarakshasha is depicted as a 10-feet tall animal like creature, which has a swishing tail, carnivorous teeth and nails. It is in the same league as the Yeti.\n\nIn July 2016, Zee TV announced the weekly horror based television series titled Brahmarakshasha—the story of a resurrected Satan.\n"}

The character is usually depicted as an opponent of the X-Men. Created by writer Bob Layton and artist Jackson Guice, he first appeared as a supporting character in \"X-Factor\" #1 (February 1986) Later, under writer Louise Simonson, he was revealed to be secretly acting against X-Factor as the leader of an anti-mutant Right organization. After being decapitated, his head was later revealed to have been attached to a large cyborg, and later merged with the cybernetic extraterrestrial Phalanx race.\n\nHe first appeared in \"X-Factor\" Vol. 1, #1 (February–March 1986), and was created by Bob Layton and Jackson Guice.\n\nThe character subsequently appears in \"X-Factor\" #4-5 (May–June 1986), #7-9 (August–October 1986), \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #282 (November 1986), \"X-Factor\" #10-11 (November–December 1986), \"Iron Man Annual\" #8 (1986), \"X-Factor Annual\" #1 (1986), \"X-Factor\" #13-14 (February–March 1987), #16-18 (May–July 1987), #21-23 (October–December 1987), \"The New Mutants\" #60 (February 1988), \"X-Factor\" #32 (September 1988), #34 (November 1988), #36 (January 1989), \"The New Mutants\" #95 (November 1990), \"X-Factor\" #60 (November 1990), \"The New Mutants\" #96 (December 1990), \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #271 (December 1990), \"X-Factor\" #61 (December 1990), \"The New Mutants\" #97 (January 1991), \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #272 (January 1991), \"X-Factor\" #62 (January 1991), \"The Uncanny X-Men\" #306 (November 1993), #313 (June 1994), \"Excalibur\" #79 (July 1994), \"Wolverine\" #85 (September 1994), \"X-Factor\" #106 (September 1994), \"Cable\" #16 (October 1994), \"New X-Men\" #16-17 (September–October 2005), and \"X-Force\" #3 (June 2008).\n\nCameron Hodge received an entry in the \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89\" #3.\n\nCameron Hodge was the college roommate of Warren Worthington III (also known as the superhuman Angel). Hodge then took a public relations job with a New York advertising firm. After Angel's former superhero team disbanded, Hodge and Worthington hatched a plan to reunite the original roster of the X-Men. Under Hodge's plan, the five mutants would pose as professional mutant hunters under the name X-Factor. They would use this cover to contact and teach young mutants.\n\nHowever, the plan backfired, as X-Factor's advertising campaign increased anti-mutant hysteria. In addition, the team suffered a series of major setbacks. After suffering severe injuries during the Mutant Massacre, Angel's wings were amputated, and then seemingly dies in a private jetplane explosion. Tensions arose between X-Factor members Cyclops and Marvel Girl when Cyclops saw manifestations of the Phoenix around Jean Grey. X-Factor later discovered that Hodge had orchestrated Angel's amputation and jetplane accident and had created holograms simulating the Phoenix Force. Hodge had secretly been Commander of an anti-mutant terrorist group. He had fully intended to exacerbate anti-mutant tensions through his advertising campaign.\n\nDuring this time, Hodge and The Right made a pact with the extradimensional demonic entity N'astirh. In exchange for collecting mutant babies, the Right needed for a spell to open up a portal from Limbo to Earth, N'astirh promised Hodge immortality and the continued existence of The Right and its work creating conflict between humans and mutants. Earlier Hodge kidnapped and tortured Candy Southern (Warren's former girlfriend). However, his former friend survived the private plane explosion and was transformed into Archangel by Apocalypse, and invades the Right's headquarters, decapitating Hodge after Hodge kills Candy.\n\nHodge's efforts would provide unexpected blows against his enemies; his employee ends up shooting dead the New Mutant team member Cypher, and another employee would end up becoming a powerful cyberneticist who, with the assistance of Orphan-Maker, would plague the X-Men multiple times.\n\nCameron Hodge was revealed to be alive, his severed head having been attached to a grotesque non-humanoid cyborg, a fate Hodge said he survived as a result of the pact he made with N'astirh. Hodge took the leading role of the anti-mutant efforts of the Genoshan government during the \"X-Tinction Agenda\" crossover storyline. In the initial attack on the X-Men, members of the New Mutants, plus Storm are kidnapped. Warlock dies when Hodge tries and fails to steal the mutant's shape-changing powers, Wolfsbane is brainwashed into a slave, and Rictor and Boom-Boom escape into the streets. During the incident, it is revealed that Havok had come to be working for Hodge as a Magistrate. Havok regains his own memory and tries to bring down Hodge from within.\n\nHodge is confronted by a combined force of X-Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants. Wolfsbane, her mind partly restored, plays a major factor in defeating Hodge, as the mutant transforms Into a giant wolf-form that severely wounds him. The fight soon comes down to Havok, Cyclops and Hodge. The villain ultimately ends up as a head, still immortal, buried as Rictor knocks a building down on top of him.\n\nCameron Hodge later returns as a member of the cybernetic extraterrestrial Phalanx race, ironically a form he would have taken if his efforts with Warlock had been successful. Yet again he was apparently slain by Archangel. Hodge was defeated by Steven Lang when the Phalanx's human interface caused the Phalanx citadel to fall from the top of Mount Everest.\n\nCameron Hodge's remains are found in the Himalayas by a group of Purifiers. He is later revived when Bastion infects him with the transmode virus gained from one of Magus' offspring. Cameron and his whole army of \"Smileys\" are killed by Warlock of the New Mutants at the behest of Douglas Ramsey when his lifeforce and the lifeforces of the Smileys are forcibly absorbed by Warlock via their shared connection of the technorganic Transmode virus.\n\nInitially, Cameron Hodge was the commander of The Right, thus he had access to all the weaponry and resources of the organization, including a ruby quartz battle suit capable of deflecting Cyclops's Optic Blasts. The demonic being N'astirh granted Hodge immortality, that is, he is able to survive a decapitation and still function.\n\nIn his cyborg form, he had the ability to phase (move through solid matter) and used various special weapons. His spider/scorpionlike robot body was equipped with tentacles, a powerful stinger, plasma and laser weapons, and a molecular adhesive gun, and could also fire bolas, knives and spears of varying sizes. He also possessed a high degree of invulnerability, enough to protect him from the combined attacks of Storm, Cyclops and Jean Grey. This effect was supposedly augmented by external generators linked to his mainframe computer. When these had been destroyed, Cyclops and Havok could destroy his mechanical body, but not kill him. In addition, in his mechanical body's first appearance, it had a cardboard cutout of a man's suit and body that hung from Hodge's neck, affecting a (to his mind) more normal appearance when his attempt to absorb Warlock's techno-organic abilities had failed.\n\nAs part of the Phalanx, he had all their typical abilities, but seemingly lost his magical protection.\n\nCameron Hodge was a member of the Human Liberation Front, a human supremacist terrorist group that had targeted Emperor Sunfire's Project Genesis, a program intended to forcefully turn humans into mutants. He was arrested following the attack on the New Mutant Leadership Program at the United Nations, though the true target was Sean Garrison, secretly an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the masterminds behind Project Genesis. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Josh Foley and Kevin Ford were about to torture him when they were interrupted by Agent Noriko Ashida, daughter of Hodge's comrade Seiji Ashida, who learned from Hodge about her father's location. Fearing the torture at the hands of Foley and Ford, Hodge convinced Noriko to kill him.\n\nA version of Cameron Hodge exists in the \"X-Men Forever\" reality.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "905870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=905870", "title": "Dilly Knox", "text": "Dilly Knox\n\nAlfred Dillwyn \"Dilly\" Knox, CMG (23 July 1884 – 27 February 1943) was a British classics scholar and papyrologist at King's College, Cambridge and a codebreaker. As a member of the World War I Room 40 codebreaking unit, he helped decrypt the Zimmermann Telegram which brought the USA into World War I. He joined the GC&CS at the war's end. \n\nAs Chief Cryptographer, Knox played an important role in the Polish-French-British meetings on the eve of World War II which disclosed Polish cryptanalysis of the Axis Enigma to the Allies. \n\nAt Bletchley Park he worked on the cryptanalysis of Enigma ciphers until his death in 1943. He built the team and discovered the method that broke the Italian Naval Enigma, producing the intelligence credited with Allied victory at the Battle of Cape Matapan. In 1941, Knox broke the Abwehr Enigma. By the end of the war, Intelligence Service Knox had disseminated 140,800 Abwehr decrypts, including intelligence important for D-Day.\n\nDillwyn Knox, the fourth of six children, was the son of Edmund Arbuthnott Knox, tutor at Merton College and later Bishop of Manchester; he was the brother of E. V. Knox, Wilfred Knox and Ronald Knox, and uncle of the novelist Penelope Fitzgerald. His father was a descendant of John Arbuthnott, 8th Viscount of Arbuthnott.\n\nDillwyn—known as \"Dilly\"—Knox was educated at Summer Fields School, Oxford, and then Eton College. He studied classics at King's College, Cambridge from 1903, and in 1909 was elected a Fellow following the death of Walter George Headlam, from whom he inherited extensive research into the works of Herodas. While an undergraduate he was friends with Lytton Strachey and John Maynard Keynes. He and Keynes were lovers at Eton. Knox privately coached Harold Macmillan, the future Prime Minister at King's for a few weeks in 1910, but Macmillan found him \"austere and uncongenial\".\n\nHe married Olive Rodman in 1920, forgetting to invite two of his three brothers to his wedding. The couple had two sons, Oliver and Christopher. \n\nHe was an atheist.\n\nBetween the two World Wars Knox worked on the great commentary on Herodas that had been started by Headlam, damaging his eyesight while studying the British Museum's collection of papyrus fragments, but finally managing to decipher the text of the Herodas papyri. The Knox-Headlam edition of Herodas finally appeared in 1922.\n\nSoon after World War I broke out in 1914, Knox was recruited to the Royal Navy's cryptological effort in Room 40 of the Admiralty Old Building, where some of his best work is said to have been done in the bath (in Room 53). In 1917, Knox followed Room 40 with its expansion into ID25.\n\nAmong other tasks, he was involved in breaking:\n\nDuring World War I he had been elected Librarian at King's College, but never took up the appointment. After the war Knox intended to resume his research at King’s, but was persuaded by his wife to remain at his secret work; indeed, so secret was this work that his own children had no idea, until many years after his death, what he did for a living, and his contribution to the war effort.\n\nThe Enigma machine became available commercially in the 1920s. In Vienna in 1925, Knox bought the Enigma 'C' machine evaluated by Hugh Foss in 1927 on behalf of GC&CS. Foss found \"a high degree of security\" but wrote a secret paper describing how to attack the machine if \"cribs\" — short sections of plain text — could be guessed. When — a decade later — Knox picked up this work, he developed a more effective algebraic system (\"rodding\") based on the principles described by Foss.\n\nGermany Navy adopted Enigma in 1926, adding a plug-board ('stecker') to improve security. Nazi Germany supplied non-steckered machines to Franco's Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. On 24 April 1937, Knox broke Franco's Enigma but knowledge of this breakthrough was not shared with the Republicans. Soon afterwards, Knox began to attack signals between Spain and Germany encrypted using steckered Enigma machines.\n\nGC&CS began to discuss Enigma with France's Deuxième Bureau in 1938, obtaining from the Bureau details of Wehrmacht Enigma supplied by Asché and signal intercepts, some of which must have been made in Eastern Europe. This led the French to disclose their links with Polish cryptographers. Knox, Hugh Foss and Alastair Denniston represented GS&CS at the first Polish-French-British meeting at Paris in January 1939. The Poles were under order to disclose nothing of importance at this time, leaving the British codebreakers disappointed. However Knox's description of his system of rodding impressed the Polish codebreakers, and they requested his presence at a second meeting.\nKnox attended the second Polish-French-British conference, held on 25–26 July 1939 at the Polish Cipher Bureau facility (at Pyry, south of Warsaw, Poland). Here, the Poles began to disclose to their French and British allies their achievements in solving Enigma decryption.\n\nAlthough Marian Rejewski, the Polish cryptographer and mathematician who solved the plugboard-equipped Enigma used by Nazi Germany, approached the problem through permutation theory (whereas Knox applied linguistics) a good personal relationship was quickly established at the conference. The good impression made by Rejewski on Knox played an important role in increasing recruitment of mathematicians to Bletchley Park. Knox was chagrined — but grateful — to learn how simple was the solution of the Enigma's entry ring (standard alphabetical order). \n\nAfter the meeting, he sent the Polish cryptologists a very gracious note in Polish, on official British government stationery, thanking them for their assistance and sending \"sincere thanks for your cooperation and patience\". Enclosed were a beautiful scarf featuring a picture of a Derby winner and a set of paper 'batons'.\n\nThese 'batons' were known as rods to the British and had been used to solve the Spanish Enigma. Knox's rodding method was later used to break the Italian Naval Enigma.\n\nAlan Turing worked on Enigma during the months leading to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, and occasionally visited GC&CS's London HQ to discuss this problem with Knox. \nIn the 1939 Registration, Turing was recorded in Naphill, staying with Knox and his wife.\nBy November 1939, Turing had completed the design of the bombe — a radical improvement of the Polish bomba.\n\nTo break non-steckered Enigma machines (those without a plugboard), Knox (building on earlier research by Hugh Foss) developed a system known as 'rodding', a linguistic as opposed to mathematical way of breaking codes. This technique worked on the Enigma used by the Italian Navy and the German Abwehr. Knox worked in 'the Cottage', next door to the Bletchley Park mansion, as head of a research section, which contributed significantly to cryptanalysis of the Enigma.\n\nKnox's team at \"The Cottage\" used rodding to decrypt intercepted Italian naval signals describing the sailing of an Italian battle fleet, leading to the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. Admiral John Godfrey, Director of Naval Intelligence credited the Allied victory at Matapan to this intelligence; Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, who had commanded the victorious fleet at Matapan, went to Bletchley to personally congratulate 'Dilly and his girls'.\n\nIn October 1941, Knox solved the Abwehr Enigma. Intelligence Services Knox (ISK) was established to decrypt Abwehr communications.In early 1942, with Knox seriously ill, Peter Twinn took charge of running ISK and was appointed head after Knox's death. By the end of the war, ISK had decrypted and disseminated 140,800 messages.\n\nIntelligence gained from these Abwehr decrypts played an important part in ensuring the success of Double-Cross operations by MI5 and MI6, and in Operation Fortitude, the Allied campaign to deceive the Germans about D-Day.\n\nKnox's work was cut short when he fell ill with lymphoma. When he became unable to travel to Bletchley Park, he continued his cryptographic work from his home in Hughenden, Buckinghamshire, where he received the CMG. He died on 27 February 1943. A biography of Knox, written by Mavis Batey, one of 'Dilly's girls', the female codebreakers who worked with him, was published in September 2009.\n\nKnox celebrated the victory at Battle of Cape Matapan with poetry, which remained classified until 1978.\n\nKnox is shown recruiting Alan Turing to Bletchley Park in Hugh Whitemore's play, \"Breaking the Code\" (1986). In the 1996 television film, he is portrayed by Richard Johnson.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31153640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31153640", "title": "Electronics technician (United States Navy)", "text": "Electronics technician (United States Navy)\n\nThe United States Navy job rating of Electronics Technician (abbreviated as ET) is a designation given by the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) to enlisted members who satisfactorily complete initial Electronics Technician \"A\" school training.\n\nThe Electronics Technician (abbreviated as ET) rating was originally established as Radio Technician (abbreviated as RT) in April 1942 during the height of World War II. The story of their training may be found at \"Solving the Naval Radar Crisis\" by Raymond C Watson, Jr. Trafford Publishing 2007 . \nThe rating insignia adopted was that of the established Radioman (abbreviated as RM) rating, and remained until October 1945, when the rating name was changed to Electronic Technician's Mate (abbreviated as ETM). In 1948, the Navy changed the name of the rating to Electronics Technician, and a new rating insignia was created.\n\nIn 1971 the Radarman (abbreviated as RD) rating was disestablished. Former Radarmen, depending on their training, were placed in to the either the established Electronic Technician (ET) rating or either of the newly established Operations Specialist (abbreviated as OS) or Electronic Warfare Technician (abbreviated as EW) ratings.\n\nOn October 1, 1998 the Data Systems Technicians (abbreviated as DS) rating was disestablished. Former Data Systems Technicians were, depending on their training, placed in to either the Electronics Technician or Fire Controlman (abbreviated as FC) rating.\n\nOn November 3, 2015 a mostly administrative change was made to the general ET rating. Electronics Technicians who volunteered for submarine duty where redesignated as either Electronics Technician, Submarine, Communications (abbreviated as ETR) or Electronics Technician, Submarine, Navigation (abbreviated as ETV). Nuclear Power trained Electronics Technicians were redesignated as Electronics Technicians, Nuclear Power (abbreviated as ETN). Electronics Technicians serving in the service rating Electronics Technician (ET) remained designed as Electronics Technician (ET). Electronics Technician (ET) is sometimes abbreviated as ETSW when it is necessary to distinguish ET from ETR, ETV, and ETN. All three new ratings as well as the original Electronics Technician rating use the same Electronics Technician rating insignia.\n\nThe reason for the change is because even those these four service ratings (ET, ETR, ETV, and ETN) fall under the same general rating (ET), share a common history, have similar names and share the same rating insignia the enlistment requirements, initial 'A' school training, specialized 'C' school training, job assignments (billets), specific qualification, and community managers are unique to each of the four service rating. This prevents someone trained in any of the four service rating from easily transferring to another of the four service rating without first going through significant retraining and qualification that would be required by anyone transferring from any of the other general rating in the Navy.\n\nOn September 29, 2016 the Navy moved away from traditional ratings to an alphanumeric system of Navy Occupational Specialty (NOS) codes. The ET-related NOS codes were: for ET, B420; for ETR, C126; for ETV, C121; for ETN, D110, D111, or D112. \n\nOn December 21, 2016 however, after months of widespread complaints, Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson released a message announcing a restoration of all U.S. Navy Ratings.\n\nETs are responsible for electronic equipment used to send and receive messages, computer information systems, long range radar, and calibration of test equipment. They maintain, repair, calibrate, tune, and adjust electronic equipment used for communications, detection and tracking, recognition and identification, navigation.\n\nJobs performed by ETs are performed throughout the Navy's fleet of surface ships including aircraft carriers and Aegis cruisers and destroyers, and at communication activities and repair activities ashore.\n\n\nEntry rates ET3-ET2 (E4-E5) specialize as electronics communications technician, electronics data systems technician, or electronics radar systems technician. ET1-ETC (E6-E7) are electronics systems managers.\n\nMaintain shore-based, ship-based, portable communications equipment, and portable Mechatronic equipment, including all associated cabling, computer, multiplexing, motor, switching, cryptographic, recording, cooling water and dry air systems; analyze equipment operation and align, troubleshoot using digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, thermal couples and repair equipment to the lowest replaceable unit; execute casualty control procedures, restoring operability for all assigned electronic equipment, recognizing mission criticality and redundancies within systems; perform administrative functions that include the updating of casualty reporting messages, technical manuals, equipment maintenance records, and managing test equipment calibration requirements;Motors and motor controls for satellite antennas, radar cooling motor control pumps mechanical knowledge of electrical motor characteristics brush and brushless, complete fiber optic and basic soldering repair, electrical safety checks, and test equipment calibration; and supervise personnel who complete maintenance, conduct tool, MAM, and test equipment inventories, logistics support, and operational verification testing of new systems or equipment.\n\nMaintain data link, inertial navigation, tactical network, message routing, digital production/projection, calibration, fiber optics, micro-miniature module test and repair, computer-based, and peripheral computer systems; analyze equipment operation, establish computer and network configurations, and troubleshoot and repair computer-based equipment to the lowest replaceable unit; execute casualty control procedures, restoring operability for all assigned electronic equipment, recognizing mission criticality and redundancies within systems; perform administrative functions that include the updating of casualty reporting messages, technical manuals, equipment maintenance records, and managing test equipment calibration requirements; complete fiber optic and basic soldering repair, electrical safety checks, and test equipment calibration; and supervise personnel who complete maintenance, conduct tool, MAM, and test equipment inventories, logistics support, and operational verification testing of new systems or equipment.\n\nMaintain surface search, air search, and weather radar systems, radar video switchboards, synchros, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) equipment, tactical air navigation equipment, including all associated cabling, cooling water and dry air systems; analyze equipment operation and align, troubleshoot, and repair equipment to the lowest replaceable unit; execute casualty control procedures, restoring operability for all assigned electronic equipment, recognizing mission criticality and redundancies within systems; perform administrative functions that include managing test equipment calibration requirements and the updating of casualty reporting messages, technical manuals, and equipment maintenance records; complete, fiber optic and basic soldering repair, electrical safety checks, and test equipment calibration; and supervise personnel who complete maintenance, conduct tool, MAM, and test equipment inventories, logistics support, and operational verification testing of new systems or equipment.\n\nEnlistees are taught the fundamentals of the ET rating through the following formal Navy schooling.\n\nAfter \"A\" school, ETs continue on to advanced \"C\" schools. School lengths and content vary, but many colleges and universities offer college credits for these Navy courses.\n\nThe Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) system supports the enlisted rating structure in identifying personnel and billets in manpower authorizations. NEC codes identify a non-rating wide skill, knowledge, aptitude, or qualification that must be documented to identify both people and billets for management purposes. The most current information regarding NECs can be found in the Navy NEOCS Manual.\n\nAfter 'A' school and between duty assignments ETs will attend advanced 'C' school training. These 'C' school give the ET advanced training in the specific systems that will be required to maintain and repair at their next duty assignment.\n\nThere are 62 ET-related NECs.\n\nThe follow NEC list is incomplete:\n\nThe Navy's Submarine Electronics / Computer Field (SECF) offers extensive training in the operation and maintenance of \"Today's High Technology\" advanced electronics equipment, digital systems and computers used in submarine combat control, sonar, navigation and communications systems. An individual selecting SECF will receive training in electricity, electronics, computers, digital systems, fiber optics and electronics repair.\nThe standards for selection for enlistment in the Navy's Submarine Electronics/ Computer Field are high. Personnel interested in applying for the Submarine Electronics/ Computer Field should be seriously interested in pursuing the challenge this highly technical field offers. They must be mature, ready to take on significant responsibility and willing to apply themselves.\n\nVolunteers for the Submarine Electronics/Computer Field will specialize in one of four Submarine Ratings (Electronics Technician – Communications (ETR), Electronics Technician - Navigation (ETV), Fire Control Technician (FT), and Sonar Technician Submarines (STS) working in one of four areas: combat systems, communications, navigation or underwater acoustic technologies. All four ratings/specialty areas are heavily involved with computer and electronics systems. The communications specialty (ETR) is responsible for all operational and administrative aspects of the submarine's radio communication equipment, systems and programs. The navigation specialty (ETV) is responsible for all operational and administrative aspects of the submarine's navigation and radar equipment, systems and programs.\n\n\nSubmarine ETs (navigation and communications) must complete Basic Enlisted Submarine School, ATT, Tactical Computer and Network Operator, and \"A\" School at Naval Submarine School in Groton, CT.\n\nNuclear-trained ETNs perform duties in nuclear propulsion plants primarily in operating, maintaining, and repairing reactor instrumentation and control systems. ETNs may be assigned as an operator to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, as an instructor at a Navy nuclear power training command, or as a technician at a shipyard or other nuclear support facility. Additionally ETNs may volunteer for nuclear submarine service. ETNs are the only rating in the Navy that can qualify as a reactor operator of a naval nuclear propulsion plant.\n\nETNs complete several different phases of training in order to be able to operate a naval nuclear propulsion plant. In order to be selected for nuclear training prospective Navy recruits must have a high enough cutscore on the Armed Service Vocational Battery (ASVAB) that score being greater than 88 and the Navy Advanced Placement Test (NAPT) that score being greater than 55%. Prospective nuclear recruits are then sent to Navy boot camp where prospective nuclear trainees are selected in a 50-30-20 ratio to be trained as nuclear machinist's mates, nuclear electrician's mate, or nuclear electronics technicians. Those who are selected to be nuclear electronics technicians then enter the Navy Nuclear Pipeline to train to become an ETN.\n\nIn the first stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, prospective ETNs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Field 'A' School (NFAS) at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC) in Goose Creek, SC. The curriculum at NFAS includes a mathematics refresher course, basic electronics theory, analog electronics theory (EFUNDS), digital electronics theory, and instrumentation and control equipment (I&CE) theory and maintenance. The curriculum is presented in a high paced manner that ramps up over the term at NFAS in order to prepare students for the difficulties of Nuclear Power School. The curriculum is very similar to that which is presented to nuclear electricians except that nuclear electricians train in electrical motor and generator theory and maintenance instead of I&CE theory and maintenance. Due to the specialized training given at NFAS, ETNs who have trained there instead of another ET 'A' school are not qualified to be assigned to billets designed for non-nuclear ETs. Personnel who are disqualified from Navy nuclear work ('de-nuked') or who fail to qualify for Navy nuclear work later in the pipeline are reclassified and retrained into another rating in order to remain in the Navy. ETN is not eligible for direct conversion to ET. This means that for an ETN to become and ET they must attend the ET 'A' school.\n\nIn the second stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETNs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Power School at the NNPTC. The curriculum for ETNs at the Nuclear Power School includes a higher level mathematics (Calculus) refresher course, introduction to nuclear propulsion systems, Navy nuclear mechanical, electrical, and electronics system design, reactor theory, health physics, basic materials science, and chemistry as it applies to nuclear power plants. The curriculum is similar for MMNs, EMNs, and ETNs, except that each rating focuses more on their particular nuclear system design (for nuclear ETNs this means that they have additional training in nuclear electronics design).\n\nIn the third and final stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETNs are trained for six months at one of four Navy nuclear prototype training units (NPTUs). Two NPTUs are moored training ships (MTS) using S5W reactors located at the Naval Weapons Station in Charleston, SC., and two additional NPTUs are land-based prototype units using a S7G reactor and a S8G reactor located in Saratoga Springs, NY. The curriculum for ETNs at an NPTU includes detailed health physics training, design, operation, and maintenance of electronics systems for the NPTU, nuclear watchstanding procedures, and nuclear casualty procedures. Unlike the first two stages of the Navy Nuclear Pipeline where the curriculum is presented in a typical classroom format, training at an NPTU is self-motivated training where students are required to research different aspects of a nuclear propulsion plant design, operation, or theory and demonstrate this knowledge in an oral interview with a qualified nuclear instructor. Additionally, ETNs must perform graded watches under the instruction of a qualified nuclear instructor where they operate a particular piece of nuclear equipment or respond to a casualty. The culmination of training for an ETN is an oral board where an ETN must demonstrate the knowledge of all procedures, equipment, theory expected for a nuclear reactor operator. Completion of NPTU qualifies an ETN to stand watch on the NPTU or to train to operate nuclear propulsion plants on a nuclear aircraft carrier or submarine. Additionally, it gives the individual the ETN Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC), and the individual is then said to be \"nuclear qualified.\"\n\nUpon completion of the Naval Nuclear Pipeline, most nuclear qualified ETNs are sent to nuclear aircraft carriers or nuclear submarines. On a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, ETNs are sent to a nuclear training division where they train to qualify to operate the nuclear reactors of the ship in a similar way to NPTU for about six months prior to being sent to a reactor control division. In contrast, on a submarine ETNs are directly assigned to the Reactor Controls division and are directed to qualify different watches incrementally. Due to the smaller number of personnel on a nuclear submarine, ETNs must also cross qualify on several nuclear electrician watches. Since ETNs are required to stand watches, perform maintenance, and train and qualify on additional submarine systems, it is not uncommon for it to take over 12 months for an ETN to become fully qualified as a reactor operator, shutdown reactor operator, and all intermediate watches. Upon subsequent transfer to an NPTU or another nuclear ship, operators are required to re-qualify the same watches in only about 6 months.\n\nEven upon completion of being fully qualified on all ETN watches (\"qualified in rate\"), additional proficiency and casualty training is required for all ETNs. On a ship this generally includes general Engineering or Reactor Department training, Reactor Controls division training, periodic exams and interviews, monitored maintenance and operations, periodic watch re-qualifications, and monitored tactical or casualty drills.\n\nUsually after an ETN is \"fully qualified\" the individual is sent to an \"in-rate\" technical school ETMS where the technician studies electronic troubleshooting and repair on shipboard equipment. Completion of this school allows the technician to be designated with the NEC 3373.\n\nSenior ETNs (typically those who hold the rank of petty officer first class (E-6) or higher) are expected to qualify for senior supervisory watches. Self-motivated training for this includes the detailed operations of all nuclear systems on a ship (not just the ETN specific parts) focusing on the big picture view of nuclear operations and casualty response. The training time required to qualify for senior supervisory watches depends on the individual.\n\n"}

In 2003, Adnan was named \"arguably the most celebrated and accomplished Arab American author writing today\" by the academic journal \"MELUS: Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States\".\n\nBesides her literary output, Adnan continues to produce visual works in a variety of media, such as oil paintings, films and tapestries, which have been exhibited at galleries across the world.\n\nShe lives in Paris and Sausalito, California.\n\nEtel Adnan was born in 1925 in Beirut, Lebanon. Adnan's mother was a Christian Greek from Smyrna and her father was Muslim Syrian and a petty officer. Though she grew up speaking Greek and Turkish in a primarily Arabic-speaking society, she was educated at French convent schools and French became the language in which her early work was first written. She also studied English in her youth, and most of her later work has been first written in this language.\n\nAt 24, Adnan traveled to Paris where she received a degree in philosophy from the Sorbonne. She then traveled to the United States where she continued graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley and at Harvard University. From 1952 to 1978, she taught philosophy of art at the Dominican University of California in San Rafael. She has also lectured at many universities throughout the United States.\n\nAdnan returned from the US to Lebanon and worked as a journalist and cultural editor for \"Al-Safa (newspaper0\", a French-language newspaper in Beirut. In addition, she also helped build the cultural section of the newspaper, occasionally contributing cartoons and illustrations. Her tenure at Al-Safa was most notable for her front-page editorials, commenting on the important political issues of the day.\n\nIn her later years, Adnan began to openly identify as lesbian.\n\nAdnan also works as a painter, her earliest abstract works were created using a palette knife to apply oil paint onto the canvas – often directly from the tube – in firm swipes across the picture's surface. The focus of the compositions often being a red square, she remains interested in the \"immediate beauty of colour\". In 2012, a series of the artist's brightly colored abstract paintings were exhibited as a part of documenta 13 in Kassel, Germany.\n\nIn the 1960s, she began integrating Arabic calligraphy into her artworks and her books, such as \"Livres d’Artistes\" [Artist’s Books]. She recalls sitting for hours copying words from an Arabic grammar without trying to understand the meaning of the words. Her art is very much influenced by early hurufiyya artists including; Iraqi artist, Jawad Salim, Palestinian writer and artist, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra and Iraqi painter Shakir Hassan al Said, who rejected Western aesthetics and embraced a new art form which was both modern and yet referenced traditional culture, media and techniques. \n\nInspired by Japanese leporellos, Adnan also paints landscapes on to foldable screens that can be \"extended in space like free-standing drawings\".\n\nIn 2014, a collection of the artist's paintings and tapestries were exhibited as a part of the Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nEtel Adnan's retrospective at in Doha, titled \"Etel Adnan In All Her Dimensions\" and curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, featured eleven dimensions of Adnan's practice. It included her early works, her literature, her carpets, and other. The show was launched in March 2014, accompanied by a 580-page catalog of her work published jointly by Mathaf and Skira. The catalog was designed by artist Ala Younis in Arabic and English, and included text contributions by Simone Fattal, Daniel Birnbaum, Kaelen Wilson-Goldie, as well as six interviews with Hans-Ulrich Obrist.\n\nAdnan also has a RAWI Lifetime Achievement Award from the Radius of Arab-American Writers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

When she was eleven years old, she wanted to be a nun, but, at about the age of twelve, her parents forced her to marry Lorenzo Ponziani, commander of the papal troops of Rome and member of an extremely wealthy family. Although the marriage had been arranged, it was a happy one, lasting for forty years, partly because Lorenzo admired his wife, and partly because he was frequently away at war.\n\nWith her sister-in-law Vannozza, Frances visited the poor and took care of the sick, inspiring other wealthy women of the city to do the same. Soon after her marriage, Frances fell seriously ill. Her husband called a man in who dabbled in magic, but Frances drove him away, and later recounted to Vannozza that St. Alexis had appeared to her and cured her.\n\nWhen her mother-in-law died, Frances became mistress of the household. During a time of flood and famine, she turned part of the family's country estate into a hospital and distributed food and clothing to the poor. According to one account, her father-in-law was so angry that he took away from her the keys to the supply rooms; but gave them back when he saw that the corn bin and wine barrel were replenished after Frances finished praying.\n\nDuring the wars between the pope in Rome and various anti-popes in the Western Schism of the Catholic Church, Lorenzo served the former. According to one story, their son Battista was to be delivered as a hostage to the commander of the Neapolitan troops. Obeying this order on the command of her spiritual director, Frances took her son to the Campidoglio. On the way, she stopped in the Church of the Aracoeli located there and entrusted her son's life to the Blessed Mother. When they arrived at the appointed site, the soldiers tried to put her son on a horse to transport him to captivity. However, the horse refused to move despite heavy whipping. The superstitious soldiers saw the hand of God in this and returned the boy to his mother.\n\nDuring a period of forced exile, much of Lorenzo's property and possessions were destroyed. In the course of one occupation of Rome by Neapolitan forces in the early part of the century, he was wounded so severely that he never fully recovered. Frances nursed him throughout the rest of his life.\n\nFrances experienced other sorrows during her marriage to Lorenzo. They lost two children to the plague. Chaos ruled the city in that period of neglect by the pope and the ongoing warfare between him and the various forces competing for power on the Italian peninsula devastated the city. The city of Rome was largely in ruins, and wolves were known to enter the streets. Frances again opened her home as a hospital and drove her wagon through the countryside to collect wood for fire and herbs for medicine. It is said she had the gift of healing, and over 60 cases were attested to during the canonization proceedings.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \"With her husband's consent St. Frances practiced continence, and advanced in a life of contemplation. Her visions often assumed the form of drama enacted for her by heavenly personages. She had the gift of miracles and ecstasy, as well as the bodily vision of her guardian angel, had revelations concerning Purgatory and Hell, and foretold the ending of the Western Schism. She could read the secrets of consciences and detect plots of diabolical origin. She was remarkable for her humility and detachment, her obedience and patience\".\n\nOn August 15, 1425, the feast of the Assumption of Mary, she founded the Olivetan Oblates of Mary, a confraternity of pious women, under the authority of the Olivetan monks of the Abbey of Santa Maria Nova in Rome, but neither cloistered nor bound by formal vows, so they could follow her pattern of combining a life of prayer with answering the needs of their society.\n\nIn March 1433 she founded a monastery at Tor de' Specchi, near the Campidoglio, in order to allow for a common life by those members of the confraternity who felt so called. This monastery remains the only house of the Institute. That July 4, they received the approval of Pope Eugene IV as a religious congregation of oblates with private religious vows. The community later became known simply as the Oblates of St. Frances of Rome.\n\nFrances herself remained in her own home, nursing her husband for the last seven years of his life from wounds he had received in battle. When he died in 1436, she moved into the monastery and became the superior. She died in 1440 and was buried in Santa Maria Nova.\nOn May 9, 1608, she was canonized by Pope Paul V, and in the following decades a diligent search was made for her remains, which had been hidden due to the troubled times in which she lived. Her body was found incorrupt some months after her death. Her grave was identified on April 2, 1638, (but this time only the bones remained), and her remains were reburied in the Church of Santa Maria Nova on March 9, 1649, which since then has been her feast day. Again, in 1869, her body was exhumed and has since then been displayed in a glass coffin for the veneration of the faithful. The Church of Santa Maria Nova is now usually referred to as the Church of St. Frances.\n\nIn 1925, Pope Pius XI declared her the patron saint of automobile drivers because of a legend that an angel used to light the road before her with a lantern when she traveled, keeping her safe from hazards. Within the Benedictine Order, she is honored as a patron saint of all oblates. She is also a patron saint of widows.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

De Frouville murdered his estranged wife, Andrea De Frouville, née Andrea Marie Wolstrup in Denmark, on April 4, 1883, and then shot and killed himself. She had legally separated from him the previous November because of his heavy drinking and abuse of her.\n\nFrederic De Frouville was born about 1850 in Virginia. His father was Frederick De Frouville, a French national who had emigrated to the United States in the 1840s and became a citizen in 1848, and his mother was Orsena Bestor of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. He also had a sister.\n\nBy his maternal aunt Maria L. Bestor's marriage, the younger Frederic was a nephew of Aaron Van Camp. The dentist served as a spy in Washington, DC for the Confederate States of America during the Civil War.\n\nDe Frouville worked for a time in New Orleans at the United States custom house. He returned to Washington, DC about 1873 and worked in various capacities in the capital. In 1877, at the time of his marriage, he worked in the Signal Corps, but was dismissed because of his repeated episodes of heavy drinking (described as \"dissipation\" in articles of the time). He later entered the Coastal Survey (today's Coast Guard). Due to his drinking, he was dismissed from this job as well.\n\nOn September 12, 1877, in Baltimore, De Frouville married Andrea Marie Wolstrup, an immigrant from Denmark who had come to Washington, DC in 1871. She left a sister and half-brother behind. Her friends had recommended against her marriage to De Frouville because they considered him too wild and reckless.\n\nWolstrup, recognized as an \"excellent linguist,\" was then working as a translator in the Dead Letter office of the US Post Office. She had been aided in finding work by Col. Charles C. Sheats, then the US Consul to Elsinore, Denmark, whom she had met on the ship to the United States. (In 1872 he was elected to Congress as a Republican Party representative from Alabama.) After her marriage, Andrea De Frouville continued to work at the Post Office under her maiden name. She resigned after becoming pregnant, but the child died soon after birth.\n\nAndrea De Frouville obtained a separation from her husband in November 1882 and started divorce proceedings because of his heavy drinking and abuse of her. Their marriage had been troubled for some time, and she had first consulted a lawyer about a separation in 1879 due to her husband's abuse.\nAfter the separation, she gained a clerkship as a translator in the Department of Agriculture due to the recommendation of Senator Hill. Friends warned her of De Frouville's threats against her in the weeks before her death, and her attorney advised her to have him arrested.\n\nAt the time of the murder/suicide, Andrea De Frouville, a skilled linguist, worked as a translator in the US Department of Agriculture. She had gained the job in 1882 by the recommendation of the Senator Benjamin Harvey Hill of Georgia, who died later that year.\n\nAn inquest determined that Andrea De Frouville was giving German lessons to an 18-year-old neighbor, George W. Buckingham, when her estranged husband entered her residence. The youth testified that Mrs. De Frouville asked him to get the police and he escaped out the back door. Her husband shot her in the head, killing her, and then shot himself with the same revolver before Buckingham could return with police.\n\nAfter the inquest, Andrea De Frouville was buried in the Congressional Cemetery and Frederic De Frouville in Glenwood Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

Dempster is best known for the invention of the Dempster-Dumpster, a now-commonly-used trash receptacle that can be mechanically emptied into garbage trucks. During the 1910s and 1920s, the Dempster Brothers Construction Company, operated by Dempster and his brothers, built a number of roads and railroads across the Southern Appalachian region. Dempster also served as a city manager and mayor of Knoxville, where he became legendary for his political battles with eccentric Knoxville businessman Cas Walker and \"Knoxville Journal\" editor Guy Smith, Jr.\n\nDempster was born in 1887, the ninth child of Scottish immigrant John Dempster and Irish immigrant Ann Doherty. John Dempster co-managed Scott, Dempster and Company, a gristmilling firm that operated a mill along First Creek. As a teenager, George Dempster travelled around the country working odd jobs for various companies, including the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Atlanta, Birmingham and Atlantic Railroad, and the Ward Line shipping company. A railroad strike in 1903 left him briefly stranded in a hobo colony in Iowa. Dempster graduated from the Girls High School in Knoxville in 1906, having served as the school's class president.\n\nAfter high school, Dempster worked as a steam shovel operator on the Panama Canal project, helping to excavate the canal's Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks. During the project, Dempster nearly lost his life on several occasions when rock slides caused his steam shovel to flip over. He also contracted typhoid fever, and bickered with famed physician William C. Gorgas over the most effective treatment. One of Dempster's earliest innovations was a device that allowed his shovel's dipper to mechanically empty its load.\n\nAfter returning to Knoxville, Dempster, along with his brothers, Thomas and John, formed the Dempster Brothers Construction Company, which helped build roads, railroads, and small dams in Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Kentucky. While initially lucrative, the company was forced into bankruptcy at the onset of the Great Depression. Dempster's Fountain City home (still standing at the corner of Broadway and Gibbs) was auctioned off to help cover his debts.\n\nIn spite of these setbacks, Dempster and his brothers reorganized their remaining resources to form Dempster Brothers, Inc., which focused on heavy machinery. In 1935, the company introduced the \"Dempster-Dumpster,\" the first large-scale waste container that could be mechanically emptied into a garbage truck. As orders for this new product poured in from around the world, the company devoted all of its resources to the production of Dempster-Dumpsters. In 1939, the company introduced the Dempster-Balester, which crushed and baled automobiles. During World War II, the company produced pontoon boats and other equipment for the U.S. Navy. The company introduced the Dempster Dumpmaster, the first front-loading garbage truck, in the 1950s.\n\nThe Dempster Brothers plant on Springdale Avenue in Knoxville consisted of eleven buildings on , and employed 450 workers. For humanitarian purposes, the plant employed a large number of handicapped workers. The plant served as a training ground of sorts for welders and machinists who would later work on nearby Tennessee Valley Authority and Atomic Energy Commission projects.\n\nDempster, a lifelong Democrat, became actively involved in Knoxville politics during the 1920s. In 1929, he was named city manager, a position created earlier in the decade. After his appointment, he convinced the state legislature to merge the offices of city manager and mayor. This move proved unpopular, and Dempster was defeated by W. W. Mynatt in the mayoral election of 1937. Dempster continued to lead the opposition to Mynatt, forming an alliance with Knoxville businessman Cas Walker, who had a strong populist backing in the city.\n\nDuring the 1930s, while city manager, Dempster began to clash with Guy Smith, Jr., editor of the Republican-leaning \"Knoxville Journal\". Smith once stated that Dempster should be \"relegated to the political ash heap and buried so deeply that one of his own Dumpsters can't dig him out.\" Dempster, likewise, quietly ordered the police to scour the city for Smith's car, and tow it away if it was illegally parked (which it often was). Smith ordered \"Journal\" photographers to crop Dempster from favorable group shots, and Dempster organized a raid that caught \"Journal\" owner Roy Lotspeich with a large supply of illegal whiskey.\n\nRunning on an anti-tax platform, Dempster's allies managed to recapture the mayor's office in 1945, and Dempster was again appointed city manager. Dempster broke his campaign pledge, and proposed new city property taxes. This provoked the ire of Walker, who immediately mounted a campaign against Dempster. Walker blasted Dempster's new taxes, and claimed that \"gambling, whiskey and prostitution\" flourished when Dempster was in power. After Walker was elected mayor in 1946, Dempster resigned as city manager. Walker's new city manager, Paul Morton, accused Dempster of cronyism, and undid most of Dempster's contracts and pay raises.\n\nWalker's term as mayor proved tumultuous, and Dempster's allies managed to oust Walker in a recall election in 1947. Dempster was elected mayor in 1951. His tenure was largely stagnant, as two major textile mills closed, and the downtown area declined with the rise of suburban shopping centers. After he proposed a modest tax increase, Knoxvillians revolted, and voted him out of office in 1955.\n\nDempster served as campaign manager for Henry Horton's gubernatorial campaign in 1928, and was subsequently appointed the state's commissioner of finance and taxation. In 1932, he was appointed to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Commission, which was responsible for buying land for the national park. Dempster ran for governor in 1940, and lost in the primaries to Prentice Cooper.\n\nDempster was named a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, although he largely retired from city politics after his defeat in 1955. He later rejoined his old nemesis Cas Walker in a successful attempt to thwart city-county consolidation, which was soundly rejected by Knoxville and Knox County voters in a 1959 referendum. Dempster died of a heart attack on September 18, 1964. Over one thousand mourners, among them U.S. senators Al Gore, Sr., and Herbert S. Walters, crowded into the St. James Episcopal Church for Dempster's funeral. He was buried next to his wife in Greenwood Cemetery.\n\nBuildings constructed during Dempster's tenures as city manager and mayor include the Henley Street Bridge, the Church Avenue and Fifth Avenue viaducts, four public library branches, and Bill Meyer Stadium. He also convinced the city to buy Chilhowee Park and Tyson Park. Dempster built several houses in Knoxville, some of which still stand in Fountain City and Old North Knoxville.\n\nDempster hired the city's first African-American civil service secretary, and supported desegregation in the 1950s and 1960s. He championed a number causes in support of the handicapped and the blind, including a radio program that featured blind pianists. He was given the Father Abram Ryan Award by the Knights of Columbus in recognition of his civil service shortly before his death.\n\n"}

{"id": "16534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16534", "title": "Jacob and Esau", "text": "Jacob and Esau\n\nThe Book of Genesis speaks of the relationship between fraternal twins Jacob and Esau, sons of Isaac and Rebekah, focusing on Esau's loss of his birthright to Jacob and the conflict that ensued between their descendant nations because of Jacob's deception of their aged and blind father, Isaac, in order to receive Esau's birthright/blessing from Isaac.\n\nThis conflict was paralleled by the affection the parents had for their favored child: \"Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.\" (). Even since conception, their conflict was foreshadowed: \"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord. And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.\" ()\n\nThis passage in is as if Jacob was seemingly trying to pull Esau back into the womb so that he could be firstborn. The \"grasping of the heel\" is also a reference to deceptive behavior.\n\nIn Genesis, Esau returned to his brother, Jacob, being famished from the fields. He begged his twin brother to give him some \"red pottage\" (paralleling his nickname, (\"adom\", meaning \"red\"). Jacob offered to give Esau a bowl of stew in exchange for his birthright (the right to be recognized as firstborn) and Esau agreed.\n\nThe birthright (\"bekorah\") has to do with both position and inheritance. By birthright, the firstborn son inherited the leadership of the family and the judicial authority of his father. Deuteronomy 21:17 states that he was also entitled to a double portion of the paternal inheritance. \n\nEsau acts impulsively. As he did not value his birthright over a bowl of lentil stew, by his actions, Esau demonstrates that he does not deserve to be the one who continues Abraham's responsibilities and rewards under God's covenant, since he does not have the steady, thoughtful qualities which are required.\n\nJacob shows his wiliness as well as his greater intelligence and forethought. What he does is not quite honorable, though not illegal. The birthright benefit that he gains is at least partially valid, although he is insecure enough about it to conspire later with his mother to deceive his father so as to gain the blessing for the first-born as well.\n\nLater, Esau marries two wives, both Hittite women, that is, locals, in violation of Abraham's (and God's) injunction not to take wives from among the Canaanite population. Again, one gets the sense of a headstrong person who acts impulsively, without sufficient thought (). His marriage is described as a vexation to both Rebekah and Isaac. Even his father, who has strong affection for him, is hurt by his act. According to Daniel J. Elazar this action alone forever rules out Esau as the bearer of patriarchal continuity. Esau could have overcome the sale of his birthright; Isaac was still prepared to give him the blessing due the firstborn. But acquiring foreign wives meant the detachment of his children from the Abrahamic line. Despite the deception on the part of Jacob and his mother to gain Isaac's patriarchal blessing, Jacob's vocation as Isaac's legitimate heir in the continued founding of the Jewish people is reaffirmed. Elazar suggests that the Bible indicates that a bright, calculating person who, at times, is less than honest, is preferable as a founder over a bluff, impulsive one who cannot make discriminating choices.\n\nPronouncing the blessing was considered to be the act formally acknowledging the firstborn as the principal heir.\n\nIn Genesis 27:5–7, Rebecca overhears Isaac tell Esau, \"Bring me venison and prepare a savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death.\" Rebecca councils Jacob to pretend to be Esau, in order to obtain the blessing in his brother's stead. He dressed himself in Esau's best clothes and disguised himself by covering his arms in lamb skin so that if his blind father touched him, he would think Jacob his more hirsute brother. Jacob brought Isaac a dish of goat meat prepared by Rebecca to taste like venison. Isaac then bestowed the blessing (\"bekhorah\"), which confers a prophetic wish for fertility (vv. 27–28) and dominion (v.29), on Jacob before Esau's return.\n\nEsau is furious and vows to kill Jacob () as soon as their father has died. Rebekah intervenes to save her younger son Jacob from being murdered by her elder son, Esau. At Rebekah's urging, Jacob flees to a distant land to work for his mother's brother, Laban (). She explains to Isaac that she has sent Jacob to find a wife among her own people.\n\nJacob does not immediately receive his father's inheritance. Jacob, having fled for his life, leaves behind the wealth of Isaac's flocks and land and tents in Esau's hands. Jacob is forced to sleep out on the open ground and then work for wages as a servant in Laban's household. Jacob, who had deceived his father, is in turn deceived and cheated by his relative Laban concerning Jacob's seven years of service (lacking money for a dowry) for the hand of Laban's daughter Rachel, receiving his older daughter Leah instead. However, despite Laban, Jacob eventually becomes so rich as to incite the envy of Laban and Laban's sons.\n tells of Jacob and Esau's eventual meeting according to God's commandment in after Jacob had spent more than 20 years staying with Laban in Padan-Aram. The two men prepare for their meeting like warriors about to enter into battle. Jacob divides his family into two camps such that if one is taken the other might escape (). Jacob sends messengers to Esau, as well as gifts meant to appease him. Jacob gets the name \"Israel\" after he wrestles with the Angel of God as he is traveling to Esau. His hip is knocked out of joint but he keeps on wrestling and gains the name. After the encounter with the angel, Jacob crosses over the ford Jabbok and encounters Esau who seems initially pleased to see him (), which attitude of favour Jacob fosters by means of his gift. Esau refuses the gift at first but Jacob humbles himself before his brother and presses him to take it, which he finally does (). However, Jacob evidently does not trust his brother's favour to continue for long so he makes excuses to avoid traveling to Mount Seir in Esau's company (), and he further evades Esau's attempt to put his own men among Jacob's bands (), and finally completes the deception of his brother yet again by going to Succoth and then to Shalem, a city of Shechem, instead of following Esau at a distance to Seir (). The next time Jacob and Esau meet is at the burial of their father, Isaac, in Hebron (). The so-called reconciliation is thus only superficial and temporary.\n\nThe narrative of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob, in , states that Esau despised his birthright. However, it also alludes to Jacob being thrifty.\n\nIn Esau's mother and father's eyes, the deception may have been deserved. Rebekah later abets Jacob in receiving his father's blessing disguised as Esau. Isaac then refuses to take Jacob's blessing back after learning he was tricked, and does not give this blessing to Esau but, after Esau begs, gives him an inferior blessing ().\n"}

{"id": "967346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=967346", "title": "Major Force", "text": "Major Force\n\nMajor Force (Clifford Zmeck) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.\n\nMajor Force first appeared in \"Captain Atom\" vol. 3, #12 (February 1988) and was created by Cary Bates, Greg Weisman, and Pat Broderick.\n\nMajor Force is a product of the same U.S. Federal project which created Captain Atom during the Vietnam War. The government, in a project headed by Wade Eiling and the scientist Megala, was experimenting with the effects of atomic energy on an alien metal they had taken from a crashed spaceship to determine its full protective abilities; such as protecting a human being from a nuclear blast. After the disappearance of Nathaniel Adam and the perceived failure of the Captain Atom Project, the government restarted the project with a new subject, Clifford Zmeck and increased the amount of metal used (\"Captain Atom\" #36 Dec. 89). While in the USAF, Zmeck had been jailed in a high security prison for rape and murder and sentenced to life in prison. He was offered a pardon in exchange for participation in the high-risk governmental experiment. The results were the same as with the Captain Atom Project and Zmeck disappeared into the Quantum Field, emerging one year after the return of Nathaniel Adam. This time, the government was ready and placed microimplants ranging from knockout gas to mini-explosives under the metal while it was still malleable, in order to control Zmeck in case he went rogue. During one mission, a government operator (who was actually the son of the woman Zmeck had murdered) activated one such charge, amputating Zmeck's left hand. Introduced as an ally, then successor to Captain Atom, Force's brutality betrayed his government-concocted role of superhero and brought him in frequent conflict with Atom. Major Force is now arguably Captain Atom's arch-enemy. Eventually, he became a hired gun for General Wade Eiling's or any other crooked government affiliated groups purposes.\n\nIn \"Green Lantern\" vol. 3, #54 (August 1994), Major Force killed Alexandra \"Alex\" DeWitt, girlfriend of the Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, and stuffed her remains in a refrigerator where Kyle would find her on behalf of the Quorum Organization who wanted the GL ring that fell into Kyle's lap. Rayner tortured Major Force after their fight, but was stopped by forces of LAPD's Special Crimes Unit. In an issue of \"Guy Gardner: Warrior\", Major Force seemingly slays Guy's mother in the same manner as Kyle's beloved girlfriend. After some confusion, it is learned Force had killed a neighbor who had been house-sitting. Having heard from Ryner about how Zmeck murdered his beloved, Gardner now awakened to his vuldarian heritage summarily executes him with a shifted edge.\n\nThis was not the end of Zmeck however, as Quorum (the very people who employed him to harass Rayner and Gardner) had revived him and enhanced him with Vuldarian DNA. His return debut started with Force \"Guy Gardner: \" #43 (June, 1996), killing Arisia, a former Green Lantern and dear friend of Guy Gardner as a declaration of war against him. Force was apparently confronted in New York, United States of America; who After a brief skirmish between the two, seemingly murdering Guy in his weakened state. Only for the latter to revive himself before dealing Major Force a fatal blow causing the villain to implode. Seemingly killing him again in revenge.\n\nIn reality, Force is made of energy and not matter. He cannot die and has effectively gained immortality. As is made apparent in the comic of \"Resurrection Man\" Vol. 1, #21 (February, 1999) he somehow revived himself from previous injuries after a ripple in the quantum field of reality somehow revitalized him. Giving Force enough raw power to challenge the JLA directly with the assistance of a quantum powered Resurrection man, only to be disassembled into particles by the immortal loner yet to reform himself at a later date. Some time afterwards he gets into a skirmish with Superman over misinformation regarding his position in the government, gaining the upper hand using Dark Quantum Energy to sap Superman's Solar Energy. But Kal-El turns the tables on him by exploiting his lack of ability, namely by hyper heating his Dilustel body to the point of flash melting him in place like a smelted statue. He was taken into custody by Amanda Waller shortly afterwards, adamantly disclaiming any connection he might have to the U.S. Government when asked by the former.\n\nIn \"Superman/Batman\" #3 and #4 (December 2003 and January 2004), Force is part of a Government Task Force led by Captain Atom, in addition to Green Lantern John Stewart, Power Girl of the JSA, Starfire of the Teen Titans, Outsiders and allies of Batman Katana and Black Lightning. He is saddled with Captain Atom by President Lex Luthor in order to bring in Superman when a Kryptonite asteroid was headed for Earth. Superman and Batman escape them in Washington, D.C., but met up with them again in Tokyo. Power Girl and Katana reveal they are double agents working with Superman and Batman the whole time. When Captain Atom and his squad pursue them to Japan, Power Girl strikes at the Major. When he returns fire, Katana chops his hands off, releasing the atomic energy he harbored. Batman convinces Captain Atom to absorb the energy leaking from Force, which threatened to decimate the city. Captain Atom absorbed all the energy and disappeared, moving several years into the future in a quantum leap.\n\nAs indicated in \"Superman/Batman\" #25, a copy of Major Force's mind, his thoughts, his anger, gets mixed in with the essence of the new Kryptonite Man.\n\nIn \"Green Lantern\" vol. 3, #180 (October, 2004), Force apparently decapitates Maura Rayner, mother of Kyle Rayner, and stuffs her severed head in an oven. He later says it was just a mannequin. Kyle snaps, decapitates Force (whose head was still talking), seals it in a bubble of Green Lantern energy and sends it into outer space (Kyle later finds out his mother is alive and well).\n\nMajor Force reappeared in the new \"Battle for Blüdhaven\" book, a title set a year after the events of Infinite Crisis, as the field leader of project S.H.A.D.E. In issue #5, he rips the right arm off a government hero named Major Victory, and beats him to near death with it (Major Victory reappears in issue #7). He also picked a fight with Hal Jordan, as Force vowed to kill any Green Lantern on sight after his last encounter with Kyle Rayner. Jordan personally wants to end Force's killing spree, enraged by Alexandra DeWitt and Arisia's murders, and even sent Force to a hard-light constructed refrigerator similar to what Force had done to DeWitt during the fight. However, Captain Atom was revived by the Atomic Knights in issue #6 (as Monarch), and Force's rampage was quickly brought to an end when Atom drains him of his energy, leaving nothing but a husk. Force's deflated corpse was last seen falling to the ground during chaos left by Atom's energy expenditure resulting in a Nuclear Blast.\n\nMajor Force is later seen reconstituted and apart of a whole new regiment of S.H.A.D.E Super Soldiers manufactured at the behest of Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard out on the white house lawn. A battle ensues between the false presidency's shadow cabinet and Uncle Sam & his Freedom Fighters for the soul of America, wherein he is quickly dispatched by Miss America even after showcasing newfound super speed against her. He was later seen being a part of The Secret Society during preparations for Oliver and Dinah's wedding.\n\nHis image appears in the series \"Ion\" as a representation of Kyle Rayner's fear.\n\nMajor Force's body is seen being kept in a secured crypt beneath Justice League of America's Hall of Justice in Washington, DC during \"Blackest Night\" #1.\n\nHowever, he is subsequently seen alive and well among a band of villains that includes Eclipso and Dr. Polaris in during \"Justice Society of America\" #29. He is also seen in the pages of \"Action Comics\" #882, as part of the government project 7734, attempting to capture the rogue Captain Atom, who had since returned to his former identity.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Major Force has his first major appearance in \"The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Man\" #20 (July 2013). He is introduced as a government agent working under General Wade Eiling, with a special rank that allows him to represent all branches of the United States Military. His primary goal is to protect, and later escort, Firestorm from the threat of various rogues and to convince him to work for the government. Major Force had previously appeared in silhouette before his full appearance.\n\nMajor Force's design is the same as that of Black Jack, also referred to as Major Bolton, a character who had appeared earlier in The New 52. Black Jack is an agent of the Black Razors, who had first appeared in \"Voodoo\" #2 (Dec. 2011). In \"Voodoo\" #5 (March 2012) and \"Voodoo\" #7 (May 2012), it is revealed that he was given powers by the Black Razors, due to recommendation of his superior, Commander Andrew Lincoln of the Blackhawks. Black Jack was decapitated by Voodoo in \"Voodoo\" #7 (May 2012).\n\nBlack Jack/Force was seen alive again some time later when ordered by General Eiling to bring in Firestorm, under the pretense that the rogue meta was a threat to national security. Eager for a chance at a rematch with the nuclear powered superhero Force eagerly accepted the mission, attacking him in the center of a populated area in Portland, Oregon. He's eventually bested when the conflicting personas of Raymond and Stein gain new trust in one another.\n\nPooling their resource as Firestorm together to take the special agent down. This was however a clever ruse on the Major's part, as he simply acted as a distraction for Wade's secondary strike team to come up from behind and cage the conjoined entity in a magentokinetic plasma field. Upon return to base however, Major Force proved he held more of a moral compass compared to his superior. Disgusted with the torment the good general was subjugated their quarry too. When the containment field threatened to cause Firestorm to go nuclear however he immediately jumped into the fray, smashing the containment field apart, enabling the prisoner to escape. Irked by General Eiling's Reckless misconduct, he relived him of duty while threatening to report him to the higher authorities.\n\nDan Jurgens, writer of \"The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Man\", says Major Force had been introduced into The New 52 earlier, suggesting that he and Black Jack are the same character.\n\nMajor Force is coated with the same Dilustel alien alloy that covers Captain Atom. As a result, he also can access the Quantum Field and use its energies for a variety of powers. Unlike Atom however, his abilities stemmed from a different spectrum of the field granting him different powers from Nathaniel, aside from the augmented physicality also lacking the capability to switch between human and energy being forms at will. This was theorized to be a result of the Major Force Project using double the amount of alien alloy and detonating a bomb with a different blast yield.\n\nWhen he debuted, Major Force seemed to control matter much in the way Captain Atom controls energy. Therefore, he could project high velocity blasts of dark matter from his hands. He could manipulate this matter into various shapes and quantities. Using this ability to create a hand to replace the one that was blown off by implanted explosives underneath his skin. He initially lacked the ability to fly, but rather leapt great distances or traveled on ramps made of dark matter. A seldom used facet of his Dark Matter powers was the capacity to convert whatever force he comes in contact with, be it matter or energy, into solid Dark Matter. A trait that was embellished upon in Batman: The Brave and the Bold cartoon series. He seemed to show some minor Self-Matter Manipulation abilities as well thanks to an upgrade to his powers using some of Guy Gardner's alien DNA, being able to shape the metal of his Dilustel into various weapons, often using this in conjunction with his Dark Matter control.\n\nEventually Major Force learned how to tap the Q-Field in order to fly both before and after his first revival from when the Vuldarian Guy Gardner fatally wounded him. Showing off a whole host of aerial maneuvers while battling Captain Atom and the likes of one of the Justice Leagues various incarnations. All of this in tandem with his metamorphic powers acquired from his gene splicing make Major Force all the more formidable an opponent to face. Matter & Energy powers aside, Major Force is a physical powerhouse comparable to some of the strongest of DC's metahumans. Force's Dilustel skin is linked to the Quantum Field, which enables him to absorb and manipulate virtually limitless amounts of matter to dynamically empower himself in the similar way Captain Atom can absorb limitless energy (but Clifford lacks imagination in the use of his abilities and is as dumb as he is psychotic).\n\nThis factor of his powers enables him superior strength (able to knock around Superman over several hundred miles from Metropolis to Ohio and trade blows with the equally powerful Captain Atom), invulnerability (He's withstood all manner of energy attacks ranging from Green Lantern and Vuldarian energy blasts, resist small to large explosive force and even weathered Captain Atom's quantum blasts more than once) Also due to his unique physiology Major Force lacks the need for physical sustenance thanks to the Dilustel's connection to the Q-Field (he can survive indefinitely without need to eat, sleep, breath or rest while in action; this enables him to thrive and speak freely in the vacuum of space), Due to his nature as pure material energy, Major Force is functionally Immortal in a similar vein to Mitchell Shelley; the Resurrection Man. For while the villain can be seemingly killed, he will always revive and return to life more powerful than ever. Even learning to access new uses to his powers, ergo every-time he's critically wounded or suffers fatal inquiry he will regenerate or resurrect stronger than before.\n\nBoth through this factor of his powers and over time with his many experiences, Zmeck became all the more familiar with using his quantum based abilities, eventually discovering he could pull off many new tricks similar to Captain Atom. Such usage of his powers as a result of better understanding them throughout his career as a supervillain include; discharging quantum blasts, throwing up protective force fields bubbles, utilize his Q-Energy for simulated TK to lift and move around objects, simulate a form of Quantum Speed akin to Resurrection Man, being able to detonate like a nuke with sufficient concentration and emit quantum blasts from any point on his body such as his hands & eyes, though he preferably focuses this through his hands as it is easier to control that way. Even being able to emit a type of dark quantum energy that can forcefully siphon energy away from other superpowered beings, such as Kryptonians, but his skill in energy absorption is lacking compared to Adam as other's have taken advantage of things the latter can handle which he cannot.\n\nIn later appearances Force, much like his counterpart Captain Atom; had a radiological element introduced into his being. Threatening a dangerous if not outright lethal nuclear fallout in the event his Dilustel shell was ever ruptured, resulting in an atomic blast capable of leveling cities. Despite this Force also boasts potent regenerative capabilities, potent enough to restore himself from total molecular dispersal if need be.\n\nOn top of all his abilities Clifford Zmeck is a military trained United States Air Force operative. An armed forces Sergeant and combat specialist, eventually bumped up to Army Major after he was reinstated by General Wade Eiling upon his successful Quantum jump into the future. Despite his loutish appearance like behavior Major Force is a seasoned war veteran with apparent skill in Black Ops, Infantry, Spy Work as well as CQC (Closed Quarters Combat). On top of this he has vast military connections within his government being their greatest weapon; having ties with Checkmate, Task Force X, Quorum's security detail.\n\nMajor Force's metallic skin, the shell which gives him his powers dubbed Dilustel. Comprises an alien being; The Silver Shield's, own physiological substance. This transorganic metal was taken from said extra-dimensional entity's own body and used in The Atom Project; which would go on to birth Individuals similar to him Captain Atom being the first successful subject and Bombshell being the latest subject of which. Unlike Nathaniel who is able to coat himself with the metal at will, Force is unable to either partially or totally remove his Dilustel from his body, it's theorized that this was due to using double the amount of which with a greater yield of nuke during his conception. Dilustel is virtually indestructible, able to withstand all manner of punishment from a great many sources to a certain degree, such as concussive force, energy beams, blunt trauma, etc. One of the few things that can damage it are X-Ionizer technologies which harden's material effected by it via atomic/molecular lattice knitting, making a knife sharp enough to pierce it or a bullet dense enough to perforate it; being the only means of extracting if from Silver Shield. The Katana's Soultaker Sword is one of the few things that can rend Major Force's nigh-invulnerable hide. Cracking or rupturing his dermal layer causes Major Force to leak Radiation at an uncontrollable rate, to which he runs the risk of Atomic Detonation.\n\nZmeck's Powers in the company wide reboot remain largely the same but at lower levels than before. He still boasts the same incredibly high levels of physical dexterity as he did in previous continuity. Retaining his incredibly high levels of strength, durability and stamina enabling him to survive falling from tremendous heights leaving craters where he lands. Instead of his typical quantum & dark matter based superpowers he now emits a form of Dark Energy he can discharge from his hands at will, this force can strike with incredible heft carried behind it as he can easily decimate vehicular automotive's with ease.\n\nBecause he lacks the ability to fly by his own power, he incorporates his leg muscles to carry himself over great distances instead. Major Force is physically powerful enough to challenge the physically amalgamated Firestorm with relative ease, actually overwhelming him in combat more than once. He's also able to resist incredible amounts of blunt trauma done onto his physical frame, able to resist sharp changes in temperature be it from Killer Frost's ice blasts or Ronnie's nuclear blasts without sustaining physical injury. He can also take high end laser fire with ease and remain relatively unharmed showing little to zero discomfort.\n\nHis abilities were given to him by the joint efforts of the Internal Operations Black Razor's and Black Hawk Organization's, under what procedure he was given his enhancements remains a mystery. There are limits to his augmentations, for in spite of his resilience and dynamism he can still be bled, injured or killed by sufficiently powerful force. Having been physically bested by the likes of Superman on their first meeting, being decapitated by the rogue clone of the Daemonite hybrid Ms. Kitaen and sustained some minor burns in preventing Firestorm from going thermonuclear.\n\nHe may also retain his resurrection abilities from his previous existence as well. Seeing as he was killed by the Evil Voodoo yet turned up alive again a couple of years later after said turn of events.\n\nMajor Force had a counterpart on the antimatter universe's Earth named Q-Ranger, a member of the Justice Underground.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2320224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320224", "title": "Nipmuc", "text": "Nipmuc\n\nThe Nipmuc or Nipmuck people are descendants of the indigenous Algonquian peoples of \"Nippenet\", 'the freshwater pond place', which corresponds to central Massachusetts and immediately adjacent portions of Connecticut and Rhode Island. The tribe were first encountered by Europeans in 1630, when John Acquittamaug arrived with maize to sell to the starving colonists of Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nThe colonists introduced pathogens, such as smallpox, to which the Native Americans had no prior exposure. They were also exposed to alcohol for the first time, which led to huge numbers of natives succumbing to the effects of alcoholism. With the passage of increasingly harsh laws against Indian culture and religion, the loss of land, legally and illegally, to growing English colonies, many of the Nipmuc joined Metacomet's rebellion in 1675, the results of which were disastrous. Many of the Nipmuc were interned on Deer Island in Boston Harbor and perished, and others were executed or sold into slavery in the West Indies.\n\nThe Reverend John Eliot arrived in Boston in 1631 and began an ambitious project to learn the Massachusett language, widely understood throughout New England, convert the Native Americans, and published a Bible and grammar of the language. His efforts, with colonial government backing, established several 'Indian plantations' or 'Praying towns'—predecessors to the Indian Reservation—where the Native Americans were coerced to settle and instructed in English customs, Christianity, but governed and preached to by other Native Americans and in their own dialects. By the 19th century, the Nipmuc were reduced to wards of the state that were administered by state-appointed commissioners. The passage of the Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act of 1869 effectively 'detribalised' the Nipmuc, and the last of the remaining Indian plantation lands were sold. Nipmuc communities continued to survive, and the tribe received state recognition in 1979, but efforts at federal recognition have not met with success.\n\nThe tribe is first mentioned in a 1631 letter by Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley as the \"Nipnet\", 'people of the freshwater pond' due the inland location. This derives from \"Nippenet\" and includes variants such as \"Neipnett\", \"Neepnet\", \"Nepmet\", \"Nibenet\", \"Nopnat\" and \"Nipneet\". In 1637, Roger Williams records the tribe as the \"Neepmuck\", which derives from \"Nipamaug\", 'people of the freshwater fishing place,' and also appears as \"Neetmock\", \"Notmook\", \"Nippimook\", \"Nipmaug\", \"Nipmoog,\" \"Neepemut\", \"Nepmet\", \"Nepmock,\" \"Neepmuk\" as well as modern \"Nipmuc(k)\". Colonists and the Native Americans themselves used this term extensively after the growth of the Praying towns. The French referred to most New England Native Americans as \"Loup\", 'the Wolf People,' but the name \"ȣmiskanȣakȣiak\", the 'beaver tail-hill people,' was recorded as self-appellation of Nipmuc refugees that had fled to French Colonial Canada amongst the Abenaki.\n\nNipmucs spoke an Algonquian language.\n\nDaniel Gookin, Superintendent to the Native Americans and assistant of Eliot, was careful to distinguish the Nipmuc (proper), Wabquasset, Quaboag and Nashaway tribes. The situation was fluid since Native Americans unhappy with their chiefs were free to join other groups, and shifting alliances were made based on kinship, military, and tributary relationships with other tribes. The formation of the Praying towns broke tribal divisions as the Native Americans were settled together, but four groups that are associated with the Nipmuc peoples survive today:\n\nChaubunagungamaug Nipmuck or Dudley Indians\n\nHassanamisco Nipmuc or Grafton Indians\n\nNatick Massachusett or Natick Nipmuc\n\nConnecticut Nipmuc\n\nGovernor Michael Dukakis issued Executive Order #126 which proclaimed that 'State agencies shall deal directly with ... [the] Nipmuc ... on matters affecting the Nipmuc Tribe' as well as calling for the creation of a state 'Commission on Indian Affairs.' The subsequent establishment of the all-Indian Commission conferred state support for education, health care, cultural continuity, and protection of remaining lands for the descendants of the Wampanoag, Nipmuc and Massachusett tribes. The state also calls for the examination of all human remains and to notify the Commission, who after the investigation of the State Archaeologist, decide the appropriate course of action.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts also cited the continuity of the Nipmuc(k) with the historic tribe and commended tribal efforts to preserve their culture and traditions. The state also symbolically repealed the General Court Act of 1675 that banned Native Americans from the City of Boston during King Philip's War. The tribe also works closely with the state to undergo various archaeological excavations and preservation campaigns. The tribe, in conjunction with the National Congress of American Indians were against the construction of the sewage treatment plant on Deer Island in Boston Harbor where many graves were desecrated by its construction, and annually hold a remembrance service for members of the tribe lost over the winter during their internment during King Philip's War and protest against the destruction of Indian gravesites.\n\n On 22 April 1980, Zara Cisco Brough, landowner of Hassanamessit, submitted a letter of intention to petition for federal recognition as a Native American tribe which would confer certain rights, including state-to-state relations with the United States Congress and other support and services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The Nipmuc, represented by just the Hassanamisco, were added to the Federal Register as Petitioner #69. Members of the Chaubunagungamaug joined the efforts. On 20 July 1984, the BIA received the petition letter from the 'Nipmuc Tribal Council Federal Recognition Committee' co-signed by Zara Cisco Brough and her successor, Walter A. Vickers, of the Hassanamisco and Edwin 'Wise Owl' W. Morse, Sr. of the Chaubunagungamaug. On 2 February 1995, the Branch of Acknowledgement and Research (BAR) of the BIA to Edwin W. Morse, Sr. declared Petitioner #69 ready for active consideration, and requested the tribal membership lists in follow-up letter later that May. By 11 July 1995, the Nipmuc were placed on 'active consideration.'\n\nPalaeo-Indians entered the region from the south-west during the retreat of the Wisconsin Glacier sometime around 9000 BC. Evidence includes various chert tools that have been uncovered at the Bull Run site in Ipswich, Massachusetts as well as various riverside excavation sites in central portions of the state. These early peoples hunted the tundra environment, probably in search of caribou and other game.\n\nThere was a great shift to more permanent hunting camps and expansion of tool making abilities. Fishing equipment, more advanced stone tools, burial culture, localised hunting, and development of stone bowls developed during the Archaic Period which began around 7000 BC. During this period, warmer weather would see forests develop and the extinction of the ice age megafauna. Settlements became more permanent and population densities increased.\n\nThe Woodland Period began with the local development of agriculture sometime around 1000 BC and would last until contact occurred in the 17th century Peoples during this period had adopted agriculture as well as slash-and-burn practices. This period would also see the adoption of ceramic pottery, introduction of the atlatl, and a culture that would have been recognisable to the later colonists. Populations increased and settlements became more permanent with the advent of agriculture. During the later stages of the period, pottery styles became influenced by Iroquois pottery styles and the bow and arrow were also adopted.\n\nDutch and English sailors and adventurers began visiting New England, although the first permanent settlements in the region began after the settling of Plymouth Colony in 1620. These early seafarers introduced several diseases to which the Native Americans had no prior contact, resulting in epidemics with mortality rates as high as 90%. Smallpox wiped out many of the Native Americans from 1617–1619, 1633, 1648–1649 and 1666. Influenza, typhus, and measles also afflicted the Native Americans throughout the period. The colonists, such as the writings of Increase Mather, attributed the decimation of the Native Americans to God's providence in clearing the new lands for settlement. The Nipmuc at the time of contact were a fairly large grouping, subject to their more powerful neighbours who provided protection, especially against the Pequot, Mohawk and Abenaki tribes that raided the area. The colonists depended initially on the Native Americans for survival in the New World, and the Native Americans rapidly began to trade their foodstuffs, furs and wampum for the copper kettles, arms and metal tools of the colonists. Puritan settlers arrived in large numbers from 1620–1640, the 'Great Migration' which increased pressure to procure more land. Since the colonists had conflicting colonial and royal grants, the settlers quickly depended on Indian names on land deeds to mark legitimacy. This backfired, as John Wampas deeded off many lands to the colonists to curry favour, many of which were not even his.\n\nThe royal Charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony of 1692 called for the conversion of the Native Americans. The English did not begin this in earnest until after the Pequot War proved their military superiority, with official backing in 1644. Although many answered the call, the Rev. John Eliot who had learned the language from Massachusett tribe interpreters compiled an Indian Bible and a grammar of the language that was well understood from Cape Ann to Connecticut. The experiment also began for the settlement of the Native Americans on the 'Indian plantations' or 'Praying towns'. The Native Americans were instructed in English farming methods, culture, language but administered by Indian preachers and councillors often descended from the chiefly families. The Native Americans melded Indian culture and English ways, but were mistrusted by both the colonists and their non-converted brethren. The remnants of the plantations were sold off, and by the end of the 19th century, only the Cisco homestead in Grafton remained in possession of direct descendants of Nipmuc landholders. List of Indian Plantations (Praying towns) associated with the Nipmuc:\nChaubunagungamaug, Chabanakongkomuk, Chaubunakongkomun, or Chaubunakongamaug\nHassanamesit, Hassannamessit, Hassanameset, or Hassanemasset\nMakunkokoag, Magunkahquog, Magunkook, Maggukaquog, or Mawonkkomuk\nManchaug, Manchauge, Mauchage, Mauchaug, or Mônuhchogok\nManexit, Maanexit, Mayanexit\nNashoba\nNatick\nOkommakamesitt, Agoganquameset, Ockoocangansett, Ogkoonhquonkames, Ognonikongquamesit, or Okkomkonimset\nPackachoag, Packachoog, Packachaug, Pakachog, or Packachooge\nQuabaug, Quaboag, Squaboag\nQuinnetusset, Quanatusset, Quantiske, Quantisset, or Quatiske, Quattissick\nWabaquasset, Wabaquassit, Wabaquassuck, Wabasquassuck, Wabquisset or Wahbuquoshish\nWacuntuc, Wacantuck, Wacumtaug, Wacumtung, Waentg, or Wayunkeke\nWashacum or Washakim\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony passed numerous legislation against Indian culture and religion. New laws were passed to limit the influence of the powwows, or 'shamans', and restricted the ability of non-converted Native Americans to enter English towns on Sabbath. The Nipmuc were also informed that any unimproved lands were fair game for incorporation into the growing colony. These draconian measures and the increasing amount of land lost to the settlers led many Nipmuc to join the Wampanoag chief Metacomet in a rebellion against the English which would ravage New England from 1675-1676. The Native Americans that had already settled the Praying towns were interned on Deer Island in Boston Harbor over the winter where a great many perished from starvation and exposure to the elements. Although many of the Native Americans fled to join the uprising, other Native Americans joined the English. The Praying Indians were particularly at risk, as the war made all Native Americans suspect, but the Praying towns were also attacked by the 'wild' Native Americans that joined the rebellion. The Nipmuc were major participants in the siege of Lancaster, Brookfield, Sudbury and Bloody Brook, all in Massachusetts. The siege of Lancaster also lead to the capture of Mary Rowlandson, who was placed in captivity until ransomed for £20 and would later write a memoir of her captivity. The Native Americans lost the war, and survivors were hunted down, murdered, sold into slavery in the West Indies or forced to leave the area.\n\nThe Nipmuc regrouped around their former Praying towns and were able to maintain a certain amount of autonomy using the remaining lands to farm or sell timber. The population of the tribe was reduced as several outbreaks of smallpox returned in 1702, 1721, 1730, 1752, 1764, 1776 and 1792. Land sales continued unabated, much of it used to pay for legal fees, personal expenses, and improvements to the reserve lands. By 1727, Hassanamisset was reduced to 500 acres from the original 7,500 acres with that land incorporated into the town of Grafton, Massachusetts, and in 1797, Chaubunagungamaug Reserve was reduced to 26 of their 200 acres. The switch to the cattle industry also disrupted the native economy, as the colonists' cattle ate the unfenced lands of the Nipmuc and the courts did not always side with the Native Americans, but the Native Americans rapidly adopted the husbandry of swine since the changes in economy and loss of remaining pristine lands reduced ability to hunt and fish. Since the Native Americans had few assets besides land, much of the land was sold to pay for medical, legal and personal expenses, increasing the number of landless Native Americans. With smaller numbers and landholdings, Indian autonomy was worn away by the time of the Revolutionary War, the remaining reserve lands were overseen by colony- and later state-appointed guardians that were to act on the Native Americans' behalf. However, the Hassanamisco guardian Stephen Maynard, appointed in 1776, embezzled the funds and was never prosecuted.\n\nNew England rapidly became swept up in a series of wars between the French and English and their respective Indian allies. Many of the Native Americans of the New England had escaped to join the Abenaki and returned to fight against the English, however the local Native Americans were often conscripted as guides or scouts for the colonists. Wars occupied much of the century, including King William's War, (1689–1699), Queen Anne's War (1704–1713), Dummer's War (1722–1724), King George's War (1744–1748) and the French and Indian War (1754–1760). Many Native Americans also died in service of the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe upheaval of the Indian Wars and growing mistrust of the Native Americans by the colonists lead to a steady trickle, and sometimes whole villages, that fled to increasingly mixed-tribe bands either northward to the Pennacook and Abenaki who were under the protection of the French or westward to join the Mahican at increasingly mixed settlements of Schagticoke or Stockbridge, the latter of which eventually migrated as far west as Wisconsin. This further dwindled Indian presence in New England, although not all the Native Americans dispersed. Those Nipmuc that fled eventually assimilated into either the predominate host tribe or the conglomerate that developed.\n\nThe Native Americans were reduced to wards of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and continued to be represented by state-appointed guardians. Rapid acculturation and intermarriage led many to believe the Nipmuc had simply just vanished, due to a combination of romantic notions of who the Native Americans were and to justify the colonial expansion. Native Americans continued to exist but fewer and fewer were able to live on the dwindling reserve lands and most left to seek employment as domestics or servants in White households, out to sea as whalers or seafarers, or into the growing cities where they became labourers or barbers. Growing acculturation, intermarriage, and dwindling populations led to the extinction of the Natick Dialect of the Massachusett language, and only one speaker could be found in 1798. One of the traditional things that survived was the peddling of native square-edged splint baskets and medicines. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, after investigating the condition of the Native Americans, decided to grant citizenship to the Native Americans with the passage of the Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act of 1869, which ultimately led to the sale of any of the remaining lands. Hassanamessit was divided up among a few families. In 1897, the last of the Dudley lands were sold, and the remaining Native Americans were housed in the 'poor house' on Lake Street in Webster, Massachusetts.\n\nIntermarriage between Whites, Blacks or (\"Chikitis\"), and Native Americans began in early colonial times. Africans and Native Americans shared a complementary gender imbalance as few female slaves were imported into New England and many of the Indian men were lost to war or the whaling industry. Naturally, many unions between Native American women and African men occurred. Intermarriage with Whites was uncommon, due to colonial anti-miscegenation laws in place. The children of such unions were accepted into the tribe as Native Americans, due to the matrilineal focus of Nipmuc culture, but to the eyes of their sceptical White neighbours, the increasingly Black phenotypes delegitimised their Indian identity. By the 19th century, only a handful of pure-blood Native Americans remained, and Native Americans vanish from state and federal census records but are listed as 'Black', 'mulatto', 'colored' or 'miscellaneous' depending on their appearance.\n\nIn 1848, the Massachusetts Senate Joint Committee on Claims called for a report on the condition of several tribes that received aid from the Commonwealth. Three reports were listed: The 1848 'Denney Report' presented to the Senate the same year; the 1849 'Briggs Report', written by Commissioners F. W. Bird, Whiting Griswold and Cyrus Weekes and presented to Governor George N. Briggs; and the 1859 'Earle Report', written by Commissioner John Milton Earle that was submitted in 1861. Each report was more informative and thorough than the previous one. The Nipmuc require having an ancestor listed on these reports and the disbursement lists of funds from Nipmuc land sales. The lists did not count all Native Americans, as many Native Americans may have been well-integrated into other racial communities and due to the constant movement of Native Americans from place to place.\n\nAttitudes towards Native American culture and history changed as antiquarians, anthropologists, institutions like the Boy Scouts as well as the 1907 appearance of Buffalo Bill Cody with many Native Americans in feathered headresses paying respects to Uncas, Sachem of the Mohegan. Despite the nearly four centuries of assimilation, acculturation, and the destruction of economic and community support from enfranchisement, certain Indian families were able to maintain a distinct Indian identity and cultural identity. The turn of the century also saw active cultural and genealogical research by James L. Cisco and his daughter Sara Cisco Sullivan from the Grafton homestead, and worked closely with the remnants of other closely related tribes, such as Gladys Tantaquidgeon and the Fielding families of the Mohegan Tribe, Atwood L. Williams of the Pequot, and William L. Wilcox of the Narragansett. Together, various tribal members began sharing cultural memory, with pan-Indianism firmly taking root in the 1920s with Indian gatherings such as the Algonquin Indian Council of New England that met in Providence, Rhode Island and dances or pow-wows such as those at Hassanamessit in 1924. Plains Indian costume was often worn as potent statements of Indian identity and to prove their continued residence in the area and because much of the original culture had been lost. Other Nipmuc individuals appeared at town pageants and fairs, including the 1938 appearance at the Sturbridge, Massachusetts bicentennial fair of many ancestors of today's Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuck.\n\nBy the 1970s, the Nipmuc had made many strides. Many local members of the tribe were called upon to help with the development of the Native American exhibit at Old Sturbridge Village, a 19th-century living museum built in the heart of former Nipmuc territory. State recognition was also achieved by the end of the same decade, re-establishing the Nipmuc people's relationship with the state and providing limited social services. The Nipmuc sought federal recognition in the 1980s. Tension between the Nipmuc Nation, which included the Hassanamisco and many descendants of the Chaubunagungamaug, based in Sutton, Massachusetts, and the rest of the Chaubunagungamaug, based in Webster, Massachusetts split the tribe in the mid-1990s. Divisions were caused by the frustrations with the slow pace of recognition as well as disagreements about gambling.\n\n190 acres of the Hassanamessit Woods in Grafton, believed to contain the remains of the praying village were under agreement for development for more than 100 homes. This property has significant cultural importance to the Nipmuc Tribal Nation because it is thought to contain the meetinghouse and the center of the old praying village. However, The Trust for Public Land, the town of Grafton, the Grafton Land Trust, the Nipmuc Nation and the state of Massachusetts intervened. The Trust for Public Land purchased the property and kept it off the market until 2004, after sufficient funding was procured to permanently protect the property. The property also has ecological significance as it is adjacent to 187 acres of Grafton owned land as well as 63 acres owned by the Grafton Land Trust. These properties will provide numerous recreational benefits to the public as well as play a role in protecting the water quality of local watersheds.\n\nIn July 2013, the Hassanamisco band selected a chief, Cheryll Toney Holley to succeed Walter Vickers upon his resignation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24124047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24124047", "title": "Nora Wall", "text": "Nora Wall\n\nNora Wall (formerly Sister Dominic) (born 1948) is a former Irish sister of the Sisters of Mercy who was wrongfully convicted of rape in June 1999, and served four days of a life sentence in July 1999, before her conviction was quashed. She was officially declared the victim of a miscarriage of justice in December 2005. The wrongful conviction was based on false allegations by two women in their 20s, Regina Walsh (born 8 January 1978) and Patricia Phelan (born 1973). Walsh had a psychiatric history and Phelan had a history of making false allegations of rape prior to the event. Phelan subsequently admitted to having lied.\n\nWall was the first woman in the history of the Irish State to be convicted of rape, the first person to receive a life sentence for rape and the only person in the history of the state to be convicted on repressed memory evidence. Her co-accused Pablo McCabe was a homeless schizophrenic man. In relation to one of the two rape allegations, the defence showed that McCabe could not possibly have been there on the date in question. The jury acquitted McCabe on that count, and convicted him and Wall on the second rape charge. On 1 December 2005, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Ireland certified that Wall had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice. McCabe had died in December 2002.\n\nThe events took place following the airing of the documentary, \"States of Fear\". A 2005 editorial in \"The Irish Times\" suggested that the programme influenced jury members and may have played a role in the miscarriage of justice against Nora Wall.\n\nWall was born in 1948 into a large, well-to-do farming family in the Nire Valley area of county Waterford. She joined the Sisters of Mercy in 1967, taking the name Sister Dominic.\n\nShe joined St. Michael's residential childcare centre in Cappoquin, County Waterford in 1975. It had been St Michael's industrial school but this was phased out at the end on the 1970s. Two, family style houses were built to house the children in the state's care there. She became the manager of this new St. Michael's in 1978.\n\nThe children at St. Michael's came from nearby counties Waterford and Tipperary. They were from troubled families who could not cope and there were often several members of one family in the home at the same time.\n\nPablo McCabe was also a local and almost the same age as Nora Wall. McCabe was handed over to St. Michael's industrial school in 1951 when he was a baby. \nIn 1988, McCabe addressed a gathering of the Sisters of Mercy in Gracedieu, Waterford. He spoke of being born in Dublin in 1949 to a single mother. She struggled until McCabe was three, but \"had great difficulty in working, paying for accommodation and paying someone to look after me.\" Thus McCabe came to live in the \"old St. Michael’s\", the junior industrial school run by the Sisters of Mercy in Cappoquin. His memories were \"very happy ones of caring and interested women.\" He then went to the Industrial School at Artane, Dublin, which he found traumatic, because it had \"over nine hundred boys in a very strict set-up.\" After leaving Artane, he began to drift and became involved with drugs, stealing to support his habit, and spent time in South America. He returned to Ireland in 1977, receiving treatment at St. Brendan's Hospital, though alcohol abuse remained a problem.\n\nIn 1980, he came to Cappoquin again. He stated, \"Cappoquin is my home. In Dublin I am homeless.\" The old institution where he had been reared had been replaced with the group homes, where he first met Wall. He hoped to find information about his mother, but none existed. In 1986 his mother wrote, hoping to find him. Wall facilitated a reunion, and McCabe and his mother spent three days together in Cappoquin. She had married in England and had four more sons, but had never told her new family of Pablo’s existence.\n\nWall left St. Michael's in 1990, and left the congregation of the Sisters of Mercy in 1994. In 1996, she worked in a St. Vincent de Paul shelter for homeless men. In October 1996, she was arrested in Dublin and questioned about allegations made by Regina Walsh, whom she had cared for from the age of eight. Walsh alleged that McCabe had raped her, while Wall held her legs, on the occasion of her twelfth birthday on 8 January 1990. She also claimed that Wall had sexually abused her on numerous occasions. Wall was not questioned then or subsequently on a second allegation: that she had assisted McCabe in raping Walsh in a virtually identical way two years previously. This latter charge, on which neither she nor McCabe was questioned, was the one on which they would subsequently be found guilty.\n\nWall maintained her innocence and was released without charge. She finished her contract with the St. Vincent de Paul and, after some time, got work with Sir Patrick Dunn’s Hospital, which she was forced to leave after the Gardaí informed the hospital she should not be working with people. In May 1997 she was formally charged. She had to sign on at a Garda station twice a day and lived on social welfare.\n\nMcCabe was arrested on the same day in October 1996. Gardaí, who interviewed at the trial, admitted to making no notes, and, under pressure of questioning from defence counsel, also admitted that McCabe did not dictate a statement as they originally suggested, but responded to questions. This is in breach of regulations, which allow only minor clarifying questions during the taking of statements. McCabe had signed two statements that were strange in the way they were formulated. For example, part of the first statement says, \"I told Sr. Dominic what had happened the night before in Regina’s room. I told her I had intimate relationships with her, meaning Regina. She said to me I was like St. Augustine.\"\n\nAt the trial a Garda claimed that he did not know that McCabe suffered from schizophrenia, and said that he didn’t see what difference knowing whether he did or not would have made. McCabe made a further statement, concerning the night of Regina Walsh's 12th birthday party on 8 January 1990. The alleged rape on 8 January 1990 was the only charge on which McCabe was questioned. Like Nora Wall, he was never questioned on the second allegation that he had also raped Regina Walsh two years previously in 1987 or 1988, again with Wall present. In fact, neither McCabe’s nor Wall’s defence teams received notification of this second charge until 28 May 1999, only six days before hearings began, and two years after they were initially charged.\n\nAfter he was released after questioning, it emerged that it would have been impossible for McCabe to have been in Cappoquin on 8 January. He was living in a Dublin hostel from 7 January and his movements were fully recorded until he was committed to Mountjoy prison on 10 January. The Gardaí then returned to Regina Walsh and put it to her that McCabe could not have been in Cappoquin on 8 January. On 5 November 1996, she \"corrected\" her statement to state that it was not the day of her 12th birthday, but of the celebration of her 12th birthday some days before or after that date, that the alleged assault took place. At the trial, witnesses were produced to show that there was no man present at the birthday party.\n\nOn 11 June 1999 an RTÉ television news announcer stated that on the previous day A 51-year-old former Sister of Mercy, has been found guilty of raping a 10-year-old girl. Nora Wall, originally from the Nire Valley, had been the victim's guardian while the child was in care at St. Michael's Centre in Cappoquin in County Waterford. Nora Wall's co-accused, Paul McCabe, a homeless man, was also found guilty of rape. Both have been remanded on bail, for sentencing in July. The victim was placed in care in St. Michael's when she was 6 years of age. When she was ten, she was raped by Paul McCabe, a homeless man who visited Nora Wall at St. Michael's. The victim told the jury that the nun held her legs while the man raped her. Both Paul McCabe and Nora Wall denied the charges. The pair were acquitted of a second count of raping the same child in 1990. The jury had heard conflicting evidence surrounding the dates of the alleged offence.\n\nThe second major charge against the two accused was that they had raped Regina Walsh in on 8 January 1990 on the girl's 12th birthday. The outcome was that the jury found the two accused innocent on that rape charge but convicted them on the other—the alleged rape that took place at least two years prior to the birthday party.\n\nAfter the conviction the media used vicious language about Wall in particular - \"Vile Nun\", \"Pervert Nun\", \"Mercy Devil\", \"I was Raped by Anti-Christ\". \nOn 11 July 1999, the \"Sunday World\" carried a front page \"exclusive\" by crime correspondent Paul Williams. Entitled \"Rape Nuns Abuse Pact with Smyth\", it claimed that Evil nun Nora Wall, convicted for helping to rape a ten-year-old child, also secretly provided children for sick paedophile priest Father Brendan Smyth. The \"Sunday World\" has learned that depraved cleric regularly visited St. Michael's Childcare Centre in County Waterford where Wall – then known as Sister Dominic – was working. A female counsellor who works with the victims of this horror home revealed that Fr. Brendan Smyth may have abused children there. ...[she said] \"the information is very reliable and also very disturbing\". A few years later, Wall was to win EUR175,000 libel damages from the \"Sunday World\". That news received little attention from the media.\n\nOn 17 June, a week after the rape convictions, Regina Walsh gave an interview to journalist Barry O'Keefe of \"The Star\" newspaper claiming that she had also been raped by a \"black man in Leicester Square\" in London. This was news to Wall's defence team. Moreover, \"The Star\" published the names of Walsh and her \"witness\" Patricia Phelan for the first time. A Kilkenny businessman read the newspaper and recognised Phelan as the woman who had made a false rape allegation against him, and the defence came into possession of this evidence.\n\nOn 23 July 1999 Wall and McCabe came before Judge Paul Carney for sentencing in the Central Criminal Court. Their counsel, Hugh Hartnett, sought an adjournment or a stay on any sentence. He told the court that there appeared to have been a grave breach of non-disclosure of evidence by the state. The state had not disclosed that Walsh alleged she had been raped in London. Neither had they disclosed that Phelan's allegations against an unnamed man had been dismissed in judicial review proceedings.\n\nHowever Mr. Denis Vaughan Buckley for the state said that the Gardaí were not aware of these matters during their investigations, and rejected the claim that there had not been full disclosure of evidence, saying that these issues were not relevant to the case.\n\nPassing sentence, the judge spoke of Wall's betrayal of the young girl. \"This was a gang rape,\" he said. \"The leader of the gang was the only person in the world who was charged with the protection of Regina Walsh. I don't think I need to say more than that.\" He sentenced her to life imprisonment and McCabe to 12 years. The hearing was not held in camera, as he said that Walsh and Phelan had forfeited their anonymity through newspaper interviews published since the trial.\n\nNora Wall was the first woman convicted of rape in the history of the state and now became the first person to receive a life sentence for that crime.\n\nThe director of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Olive Braiden, welcomed the imposition of a maximum sentence, and said it would ensure that Nora Wall would be monitored for the rest of her life to prevent recurrence.\n\nFour days later on 27 July 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the convictions of the two accused. Both were granted bail and it was stated that the question of a possible re-trial would be considered subsequently. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) applied to have the previous week's convictions set aside, telling the court that one witness had been called to give evidence at the trial inadvertently, despite a decision of the DPP that this person should not be called.\n\nThe Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions also referred to two other additional though less central factors in the case. The first was the information that the alleged victim had made but not pursued an allegation of being raped in England. He said that whatever the significance of this information it could not be properly argued that it was not relevant. He said that the prosecution was not aware of this information until it was mentioned in court. There was also another as yet undisclosed factor relating to the alleged victim which might be considered relevant.\n\nOn Saturday 31 July, the Irish Times published an article by writer and journalist Kevin Myers. He was one of the very few to speak out in favour of Wall and McCabe at the time. He originally wrote a column on Monday 26 July to be published on Wednesday but it was withdrawn because what he sought to achieve was already happening – the release of the two accused. He described the trial as a \"witch-hunt\": We should always beware the deeds of good men and women when there is a public war against vice of any kind. The \"witches\" of Salem were not persecuted by bad men or women; people then genuinely lived in fear of witchcraft, just as they did of communism in the 1950s. In the witch-hunt to remove it from public life in the US, innocent people's lives were ruined, yet through often honourable motives (apart from those of Joe McCarthy).\n\nAfter their conviction, the Sisters of Mercy issued a statement, which read: We are all devastated by the revolting crimes which resulted in these verdicts. Our hearts go out to this young woman who, as a child, was placed in our care. Her courage in coming forward was heroic. We beg anyone who was abused whilst in our care to go to the Gardaí.\n\nEven after the collapse of the case against the two accused, the Sisters of Mercy made no effort to apologise to Wall or to withdraw their statement of support for Walsh. One commentator remarked: \"The young woman their hearts were going out to, was the false accuser, not their own innocent nun. Our absolutist system had seduced them into identifying with the accuser and betraying their own sister.\"\n\nFour months later, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr James Hamilton, decided to seek a retrial in the case. In mid-November he released to the media a detailed six-page report dated 1 October, addressed to the attorney general, Michael McDowell, SC, which gave an account of the mistakes, failures and omissions in the offices of the DPP and Chief State Solicitor and in the conduct of the case, which resulted in a witness for the prosecution being called against the wishes of the DPP. A DPP had never previously explained himself in a specific case in the office's 25-year history.\n\nHowever the attorney general declared that neither Wall nor McCabe would receive an apology, saying that the issue of an apology did not arise because the convictions had been quashed.\n\nAt the Court of Criminal Appeal on 22 November 1999, the DPP accepted \"fully and ungrudgingly\" that former nun Wall and McCabe are entitled to be presumed innocent of all charges brought against them. At the court hearing a lawyer for the DPP said he \"very much regrets the errors which occurred in relation to the handling of this case by the prosecution\" which led to the successful appeal.\n\nThe DPP's statement outlined the sequence of events from the decision to prosecute on 24 April 1997 up to their release by the Court of Criminal Appeal, initially on bail, in July just days after they had been sentenced to life and 12 years respectively. It explained how the prosecution came to call Patricia Phelan as witness, despite an earlier direction by the DPP made in April 1997 that she should not be called.\n\nDenis Vaughan Buckley SC, for the DPP, read a prepared statement. He said the DPP had considered the transcript of evidence that was given at the trial together with additional information obtained by the Gardaí and had concluded that it would not be proper to proceed with his application for a retrial. He added: I am instructed to emphasise that the director's concern to defend the propriety of the decision to charge the two accused does not in any sense detract from the fact, which is fully and ungrudgingly accepted by the director, that the two accused are entitled to be presumed innocent of all the charges which were brought, not only those of which they were acquitted by the jury but also of those which were set aside and which are not to be the subject of further proceedings.\n\nPresiding judge Mr Justice Murray sitting with Mr Justice Smyth and Mr Justice Kelly said the court would confirm the setting aside of the convictions, with no order for a retrial. The judges confirmed that neither Wall nor McCabe would have to pay the costs of their lengthy proceedings which could total around £60,000.\n\nAt the end of the court hearing, Wall pushed her way through the throng of reporters and family to catch up with Buckley, the prosecuting barrister. She extended her hand to the man who had presented the state's flawed case against her and said \"thank you for what had just happened in court.\" According to Irish Independent journalist Aideen Sheehan, Buckley shook hands, looking taken aback at the unexpected gesture, so rare coming from the opposing side after such a serious criminal trial.\n\nOn 1 December 2005 the Court of Criminal Appeal finally certified that Wall had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.\n\nAfter her acquittal Nora Wall was asked by journalist Kevin Moore what she planned to do with the rest of her life: Well, I suppose to be practical and realistic people at my age are taking early retirement and being made redundant. And you know, what employer wants a person like me? They will ask what you have done for the last three years. I signed on twice a day at the garda station, had 32 court appearances, had a six-day trial in the Central Criminal Court, four days of a life sentence in the Joy, you know, what employer wants that?\n\nWall described how she felt after she was arrested:I could not understand what they were saying to me at first. When they said \"rape\", I said that I was never raped. And it did not make sense. Then, they said that it happened in St. Michael's in Coiscéim. And it still did not make sense to me. And then they said, Regina Walsh ... I was still turning around in my head how this could be. And then they mentioned Paul [McCabe]. That did not make sense at all to me. And then, when they told me what was supposed to have happened, I said, \"Look, I could not think like that, never mind do a thing like that\" ... It was a full 11 months afterwards that I got the book of evidence.\n\nOn her treatment by the Gardaí, Wall stated: Well, they could have been nicer to me verbally. I went on a bus to Knock and booked into a B&B and the next morning I walked around Knock and went to Mass and I went into the Blessed Sacrament Church and I read the book of evidence there. And, after reading it, I was very much at peace with myself. I wrote to my brothers and sisters and I remember I used the 4 Ds ... I said that I had read the book and I can cope with it and there is nothing in it that I can't defend, deny, discuss, or debate... I have no ill feeling against Regina and Patricia.\n\nReligious affairs journalist Breda O'Brien wrote: It would be easy to demonise the two young women, but Nora Wall will have none of it. Regina Walsh had spent time in St. Declan’s Psychiatric Unit, after a suicide attempt, immediately prior to making the allegations. Regina and Patricia were vulnerable people, she maintains, and she in particular commends Patricia for having the courage to eventually admit that she had lied. It had a particular poignancy, because Patricia was her \"first baby\", reared since 13 months of age in Coisceim. After the miscarriage of justice was declared, Nora extended her hand to Patricia and told her that she was \"still her first baby\", which caused Patricia to fall into her arms and cry uncontrollably.\nNora Wall currently lives in a private apartment on the grounds of Cuan Mhuire (a narcotic and alcohol rehabilitation centre) just outside the town of Athy in Co. Kildare.\n\nAlthough there were two persons accused of rape, the media focused almost exclusively on Nora Wall. An exception is the detailed account of the case by Breda O'Brien in Studies Review entitled: \"Miscarriage of Justice: Paul McCabe and Nora Wall\". She quotes the words of Linda Loman in Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman', about her husband Wille Loman enduring humiliation at the end of his career; \"I don't say he's a great man... His name was never in the paper. He's not the finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall in his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must finally be paid to such a person.\"\n\nAfter his release from prison in July 1999 Pablo McCabe lived in Oak House, a hostel for homeless men in the inner city of Dublin and over the next three years lived the typical life of the homeless. Short on cash he would get drunk now and then and try to bully other men to bring alcohol into the rooms which was forbidden. At those times he would become belligerent and offensive.\n\nHis physique had been broken down over the years by alcohol and poor diet and was further weakened by a stroke. When speaking to men in the hostel and nearby day centre, he always maintained his innocence of the rape, but said that the mud had stuck. His mother wrote to him from England but he did not reply to her letters. He had four stepbrothers in Liverpool but made no attempt to contact them. In November 2002 he had a seizure in the hostel and was rushed to the Mater Hospital where six weeks later after a number of other collapses he died, a few days before Christmas. His mother Helen and stepfather were informed but because of illness could not travel immediately.\n\nHis remains were kept in the mortuary of the Mater until the family could travel. His mother and his stepfather attended the funeral in the Franciscan Church in Merchant's Quay, Dublin, on 14 January 2003.\n\nOn 16 December 2005 the three judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal gave detailed reasons for their decision. They began by providing a summary of the legal background as follows (minor editorial changes have been made for the purpose of clarity): \n\nOn 10 June 1999, Nora Wall was convicted by the Central Criminal Court of rape contrary to common law and of indecent assault contrary to common law as punishable by s.10 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981. On 23 July 1999, she was sentenced by the Central Criminal Court to imprisonment for life for the offence of rape and to 5 years imprisonment for indecent assault.\n\nOn 27 July 1999, Nora Wall brought a bail application before the Court of Criminal Appeal, at which point senior counsel on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) conveyed to that court the DPPs consent to the granting of leave to appeal, and further consented that the appeal be allowed and that a retrial be directed. This startling turn of events was referable to (a) the inadvertent calling as a witness on behalf of the prosecution, Patricia Phelan, a person whom the DPP had specifically directed should not be so called at the trial and (b) matters regarding the complainant, Regina Walsh, which had not been disclosed to the lawyers representing the applicant prior to trial.\n\nOn 22 November 1999, counsel for the DPP indicated to the court of criminal appeal that the DPP was not proceeding with an application for a retrial. Counsel further indicated that the DPP “fully and ungrudgingly” accepted that the applicant was entitled to be presumed innocent of all charges preferred against her. The court accordingly quashed the conviction of Nora Wall and the sentences imposed in respect thereof.\n\nIn the main body of the judgement, the three judges went on to find that, due to the withholding of important information by the prosecution, including the investigating police, at the trial stage, it was not until appeal that the court heard a substantial body of significant evidence that had not been disclosed to the defence.\n\nConcerning the complainant, Regina Walsh, the evidence that had not been disclosed to the defence included that she:\n\n\nConcerning the witness Phelan, the prosecution had failed to disclose that:\n\n\nThe judges noted that in her further statement of 2 April 2001, Phelan in part stated: In the trial, held at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin, I gave evidence on oath in the complaint against Nora Wall and Paul McCabe. In evidence, I told the judge and jury that I saw Paul McCabe rape Regina and that Nora Wall was present holding Regina's legs down. I gave other evidence but I cannot remember what. At the time I gave this evidence in court, I knew it was wrong and against the law but I just wanted to get back at Dominic (i.e. Nora Wall). I was also afraid to pull back on my evidence because I thought that once I had made a statement I had to give evidence in court. The reason why I wanted to get back at Dominic was because she used to physically beat me when I was living the Group Homes. She gave me a terrible life and I hated her. I remember ringing Sr. Mona Kilkeen. She was a good friend of mine for many years. It was during the trial, but I cannot remember much of the details.\n\nThe Court of Criminal Appeal found that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, and that there had been a serious breakdown in communications between the offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor, the Garda Síochána (police) and prosecuting counsel.\n\nThe court made particular reference to a file note contained within the file of the DPP which was in the following terms:\n\nLocal Gardaí who have dealings with her during previous investigations have found her most unreliable. She never mentioned to the members anything about a rape at any time. Therefore her evidence should not be accepted as accurate.\n\nFrom the appeal bench, Justice Kearns found that \"there had been significant non-disclosure in this case, including (a) the information that Regina Walsh had made, but not pursued, an allegation of being raped in England, and (b) the non-disclosure of Regina Walsh's very proximate and material psychiatric history\" .\n\nHe also found that: the applicant was further prejudiced during the course of her trial by evidence of which the defence had no prior notification, namely, that Regina Walsh recalled the alleged episodes of rape by reference to \"flashbacks and/or retrieved memory\", while there was \"no scientific evidence of any sort adduced to explain the phenomenon of flashbacks and/or retrieved memory.\n\nAfter the Court of Criminal Appeal confirmed Nora Wall's innocence, she approached Patricia Phelan. According to Irish Independent journalist Ann O'Loughlin \"Immediately after the court's decision, Ms Wall, with her hand outstretched, approached Ms Phelan. A tearful Ms Phelan threw her arms around Ms Wall and hugged her.\" \n\nShort-lived criticism of the judge centered not so much on his description of Nora Wall as a \"gang rapist\" but on the sentence of life imprisonment he imposed on her. University College Galway law lecturer Tom O'Malley said that the life sentence was completely unexpected as past cases of serial and serious child sex abuse had attracted sentences of between eight and 12 years.\n\nAfter the Nora Wall case however, Mr Justice Carney struck some rather different notes. In 1999, Carney told a seminar in South Africa that some alleged victims of rape might be pressured into continuing with complaints they were reluctant to pursue. \"Such pressure could come from parents, boyfriends, policemen, prosecutors, rape crisis centres and victim support counsellors,\" he said. \"I have no way of knowing whether such pressure exists, but I would be very concerned if it does, particularly in relation to those cases which can be profiled as unlikely to result in a conviction.\"\n\nIn April 2003, at a Women Lawyers' Association conference, Carney dismissed the claim of the director of the Rape Crisis Centre (RCC) that there was no such thing as a false sexual charge. \"This is not the experience of the courts,\" he said. \"In relation to the balance of rape cases which are contested, there is a majority of acquittals.\" The judge also criticised an RCC counsellor for suggesting in a victim impact statement that the severity of sentence imposed on a rapist would determine the degree to which the victim became \"reconciled with the justice system\". Carney said it was a \"serious abuse of process\" for the author of a victim impact report to use it to campaign for a heavy sentence.\n\nThe former director of the Rape Crisis Centre, Olive Braiden, clashed with Carney at the conference. \"He launched into a criticism of a senior counsel who was not present, and I said I regretted that he had raised the matter in her absence,\" she said.\n\nThe above examples are taken from a detailed profile of Mr Justice Paul Carney in \"The Sunday Business Post\" on 13 April 2003, written by barrister and author Kieron Wood. The article is entitled \"Judge With One Eye On The Media\". It includes some critical comments and notes that \"His time on the bench was marked by controversy\". Nevertheless, it contains no reference to the case of Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe.\n\nOn 6 September 1999, the Irish Independent reported the views of the Dáil (Irish parliament) opposition party Justice spokesman Jim Higgins: The Director of Public Prosecutions faced a barrage of criticism for its handling of the high profile case. Fine Gael's justice spokesman Jim Higgins said it was dealt with sloppily the prosecution pursued the case \"with vigour and determination\" but on the day after the convictions the DPP moved to have them quashed.\n\n\"There are two issues here,\" said Mr Higgins. \"The first is how a witness could have been called to give evidence against the expressed wishes of the DPP. The other is the non-disclosure of evidence. It is common law principle that all material in possession of the prosecution must be handed over to the defence, even if it is damaging to the prosecution's case. We have to investigate whether that evidence was withheld deliberately or inadvertently.\"\n\nThe issue of non-disclosure of evidence in the Nora Wall case was not followed up in Ireland but did attract some attention abroad. The \"Journal of the Law Society of New South Wales\" (Australia) for June 2006 has an article by solicitor Greg Walsh entitled \"Criminal Law: Obligation is on prosecutors to disclose\". This includes a detailed discussion on the Nora Wall case. However, there seems to be no equivalent article in the journal of the Irish Law Society.\n\nOn 21 November 1999, Liz Allen, crime correspondent for the \"Sunday Independent,\" wrote that the Chief State Solicitor's Office which dealt with the Nora Wall case also dealt with a previous case involving a sexual assault allegation by Patricia Phelan, the woman who was later mistakenly called as a witness against Nora Wall.\n\nIn the Patricia Phelan case in 1997 (in which she accused the Kilkenny businessman), Mr Justice McCracken carried out a High Court judicial review and decided that there should not be a trial. The state asked for time to consider whether it would appeal this decision, but three weeks later, the then DPP, Eamon Barnes, ordered the Chief State Solicitor's Office to return to court to say it did not wish to proceed any further with the case it was taking on behalf of Patricia Phelan and another woman.\n\nThe \"Sunday Independent\" obtained documentation dated May 1997, which shows that the Chief State Solicitor's Office wrote to the solicitor for the Kilkenny businessman in the case taken on behalf of Ms Phelan, providing a list of witnesses who had made statements which the state intended to use in its case. \"This list included the name of Nora Wall\".\n\nWhen details of the DPP's report on the blunders in the Nora Wall case were released by the Attorney General's office on 17 November 1999, there were no references to the documentation linking the Chief State Solicitor's Office to both cases. The report failed to explain why the DPP did not want Ms Phelan called as a witness. The DPP's statement said only that she was mistakenly called because prosecuting counsel \"failed to recall\" an earlier direction not to call her.\n\nIn his decision in the judicial review of the original Phelan case on 5 January 1997, Mr Justice McCracken said: \"While I have great sympathy for [the two women], I have to say that I was not particularly impressed with their evidence.\" He added, however, that this was \"not a deciding factor\" in his decision to prevent the DPP from taking the man to trial.\n\nLiz Allen quoted Fine Gael's justice spokesman, Jim Higgins, as stating that the establishment of this link between the case originally taken by Ms Phelan and the Wall case merited a judicial inquiry \"to investigate the role of Gardaí and the Chief State Solicitor's Office.\" Higgins continued: \"There now has to be a full inquiry into the roles of all of the agencies involved, the role of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, the DPP's Office and the Gardaí must be investigated further. We must question the ability of these people to conduct their jobs when such gross incompetence occurred in the Wall case with regard to the inadvertent calling of Ms Phelan as a witness.\"\n\nIndeed, the close links that existed between personnel involved in the case against Nora Wall and that against the Kilkenny businessman - both involving Patricia Phelan - makes it difficult to understand how Phelan could have been called in error as a witness in the Wall case. The December 2005 judgement of the Court of Criminal Appeal underlined these links when the judges pointed out that \"the police officer who had taken Phelan's statement in respect of Nora Wall was the same police officer who investigated the earlier false complaints made by her against her uncle and against the Kilkenny man.\" However Jim Higgins's calls for an inquiry were ignored and this issue was quickly dropped by the media.\n\nThe case of Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe established a number of extraordinary precedents in Irish law.\n\n\nNora Wall and Pablo McCabe were convicted on 10 June 1999; Regina Walsh gave her famous interview to \"The Star\" on 17 June including her allegation about being raped in London; the Kilkenny businessman recognised the name of Patricia Phelan and contacted the defence but still the DPP remained in ignorance of the facts. At the sentencing hearing on 23 July the DPP refused the defence's application for an adjournment and denied that the newly discovered evidence was relevant. Finally Judge Paul Carney made his comments about Nora Wall and gave her an unprecedented sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nNora Wall and Pablo McCabe were originally accused in 1996 shortly after the broadcast by RTÉ of the TV documentary \"Dear Daughter\" in February of that year; they were convicted in June 1999 one month after RTÉ's broadcast of the \"States of Fear\" series produced by Mary Raftery.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that Nora Wall was convicted because of the atmosphere generated by the \"States of Fear\" series (see \"States of Fear\" subsection below). It is also accepted – not least by Mary Raftery herself – that \"Dear Daughter\" was an important predecessor to \"States of Fear\". In the book \"Suffer the Little Children\" published in November 1999 as a follow up to her TV series, Mary Raftery and her co-author Eoin O'Sullivan wrote: \"Dear Daughter\" concerned the experiences at Goldenbridge Industrial School, Dublin, of Christine Buckley, who grew up there during the 1950s. She had suffered horrific abuse, and descriptions were also given of the systematic ill-treatment of other children by the Sisters of Mercy, who ran the school. These included memories of children being routinely and savagely beaten, having boiling water poured over them, being locked in a furnace room, being forced to stand all night in a corridor as punishment, and very young children being made to sit on potties so long that in some cases their rectums collapsed.\n\nThe authors go on to say that \"the programme produced an enormous response, most of it horrified at the deeply shocking nature of the abuse outlined,\" However they also acknowledge that the Sisters of Mercy had their defenders and that after the programme two sisters who were at Goldenbridge gave different accounts of one alleged episode. However they conclude that: \"Three years later, the testimony of severe abuse in industrial schools is now so overwhelmingly consistent, that the 'false memory' line of argument has not been repeated in relation to the flood of accounts of abuse during 1999.\" \n\nThus Mary Raftery believes that any apparent contradictions brought to light in the controversy that followed \"Dear Daughter\" were fully ironed out by the \"States of Fear\" programmes.\n\nIn February 1996 RTÉ broadcast \"Dear Daughter\" – Louis Lentin's TV documentary about alleged abuse in St Vincent’s residential school, Goldenbridge, Dublin, which was run by the Sisters of Mercy. It featured the story of Christine Buckley who had been there in the 1950s.\n\nThe documentary concentrated on allegations made against one Mercy nun Sister Xavieria. The programme claimed that, on one occasion, Christine Buckley had been caned by Sister Xavieria so severely that the entire side of her leg was split open from her hip to her knee. She said that she was treated in the casualty department of the local hospital and believes that she received 80 to 120 stitches. No medical evidence has ever been produced to support this claim.\n\nThe surgeon who ran the casualty department at the hospital has made a statement which renders it highly unlikely that such an incident ever took place. The surgeon pointed out that caning would not have caused a wound of this kind, which would have required surgical treatment under a general anaesthetic and not stitches in a casualty department.\n\nYet the allegations against the Sisters of Mercy were widely believed at the time. In his essay \"\"States of Fear\", the Redress Board and Ireland's Folly\", UK cultural historian Richard Webster states that \"in the wake of the broadcast, atrocity stories about Goldenbridge and other industrial schools began to proliferate\".\n\nNora Wall and Pablo McCabe were accused by Regina Walsh within months of the broadcast of \"Dear Daughter\". Her \"witness\" Patricia Phelan accused the Kilkenny businessman of rape at about the same time. It was his testimony that would eventually cause the collapse of the case against Wall and McCabe.\n\nIn April and May 1999 RTÉ broadcast a much more extensive three-part documentary series, States of fear, which was written, produced and directed by Mary Raftery. The programmes portrayed the industrial schools as part of a chaotic and Dickensian child-care system, which was run by the Catholic Church and funded by the state. The programmes also featured a series of claims by former residents of the schools that they had been physically or sexually abused by members of orders such as the Christian Brothers, the Sisters of Mercy and the Sisters of Charity. References were also made to a number of unexplained deaths which allegedly took place in these schools.\n\nThe series provoked a huge public response. As Raftery herself puts it, \"Outrage at the crimes committed against these children was expressed continuously for the three weeks of the series, across acres of newsprint and hours of radio broadcasts all over the country.\" During the course of this outbreak of outrage the religious orders were demonized. The following is an extract from an article by Irish journalist Stephen Dodd on 9 May 1999, entitled \"Church Needs Public Exorcism Over Abuse\"In Australia, hundreds of orphaned children were flogged, beaten and sexually abused at a Sisters of Mercy orphanage in Queensland. The regime of abuse is believed to have lasted 90 years. One child was said to have been burned with a red-hot poker to \"exorcise the devil\". A nun pulled out another child's ingrown toenails with a pair of pliers. Girls were raped by priests and male workers. Some became pregnant and miscarried. It is alleged that foetuses were flushed down lavatories to cover up the crimes.\n\nThe final programme in the series was broadcast on 11 May 1999. Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were convicted of rape on 10 June.\n\nCarol Coulter, legal affairs correspondent for the \"Irish Times\" wrote on 1 December 2005 that \"[The case] took place at a time of heightened sensitivity to the problem of the sexual abuse of children in institutions, especially those run by religious orders. The RTÉ series \"States of Fear\" had ended a month earlier, generating widespread debate and indignation.\" An \"Irish Times\" editorial on 17 December 2005 entitled \"Nora Wall\" stated that: The charges were laid at a time when allegations of the abuse of children in institutions had entered the public domain. The case was heard within a month of the broadcast by RTÉ of the \"States of Fear\" programmes. The jury could not but have been affected, it seems, by the horrific abuse exposed in that series and by the complaints of the child victims that no-one listened to them.\n\nWall told teacher and religious affairs journalist Breda O'Brien that she has no doubt that the atmosphere generated by \"States of Fear\" was a central factor in the jury's willingness to believe the allegations. In addition, the opinion of the \"Irish Times\" is significant as in 1999 Mary Raftery was both a columnist for the Times \"and\" a senior producer/director with RTÉ.\n\nThe focus on the \"States of Fear\" programmes may explain why, apart from news reports on trial days, RTÉ's coverage of the scandal was confined to a 30-minute programme in the \"Would You Believe\" series on 11 January 2000.\n\nOn 28 November 1999, the \"Sunday Independent\" published an article entitled \"Judge reflects a nation's outrage\" by columnist Emer O'Kelly. The title refers to the sentencing by Judge Anthony Murphy of a Brother of Charity to 36 years imprisonment for the physical and sexual abuse of children. However the article contains these words about the Nora Wall case: When the former Mercy nun Nora Wall was vindicated, and an announcement was made that she was not to be retried for rape, there was an outcry from some members of the public about the way she had been vilified before her conviction was set aside. The horrible reality of our society is that so many appalling crimes of abuse of children by Catholic religious have been proved in the courts that many people are inclined to believe that no cleric, man or woman, accused of such crimes can possibly be innocent. And that is not the fault of public opinion. It is in large measure the fault of the religious authorities who seem more concerned with limiting the damage to their own reputations and standing than in acknowledging their collective guilt and active negligence.\n"}

{"id": "31434017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31434017", "title": "Political and religious beliefs of Stanley Kubrick", "text": "Political and religious beliefs of Stanley Kubrick\n\nThe political and religious views of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick (1928–1999) have been subjects of speculation during his lifetime and after his death. While early films like \"Paths of Glory\" (1957) seem to reflect an overtly progressive ideology, later films such as \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971) can be construed as equally critical of the political left and right. Despite the lack of commitment to a particular world-view, it is generally agreed that Kubrick was fascinated by the possibilities of a supernatural reality, as reflected in \"\" (1968) and \"The Shining\" (1980).\n\nIn his memoir of Kubrick, Michael Herr, his friend and co-writer of the screenplay for \"Full Metal Jacket\" (1987), wrote:\nStanley had views on everything, but I would not exactly call them political... His views on democracy were those of most people I know, neither left nor right, not exactly brimming with belief, a noble failed experiment along our evolutionary way, brought low by base instincts, money and self-interest and stupidity... He thought the best system might be under a benign despot, though he had little belief that such a man could be found. He wasn't a cynic, but he could have easily passed for one. He was certainly a capitalist. He believed himself to be a realist.\nHerr recalls that Kubrick was sometimes akin to a 19th-century liberal-humanist, that he distrusted almost all authority, that he once alluded to Irving Kristol's definition of a neoconservative (\"a liberal who has been mugged by reality\") in a favorable way, and that he was \"seemingly\" a social Darwinist.\n\nHerr further wrote that Kubrick owned guns and did not think that war was an entirely bad thing. In the documentary \"\", Herr says \"…he also accepted that it was perfectly okay to acknowledge that, of all the things war is, it's also very beautiful.\" The writer said of initial reactions to \"Full Metal Jacket\" that \"The political left will call Kubrick a fascist.\" In a 1987 interview with Gene Siskel, called \"Candidly Kubrick\", Kubrick said, \"\"Full Metal Jacket\" suggests there is more to say about war than it is just bad.\" He added that everything serious the drill instructor says, such as \"A rifle is only a tool, it is a hard heart that kills\", is completely true.\n\nFrederic Raphael, who co-authored the \"Eyes Wide Shut\" script with Kubrick, says that the director once remarked that \"Hitler was right about almost everything\", and insisted that any trace of Jewishness be expunged from the \"Eyes Wide Shut\" script. Kubrick's supposed relationship to his own ethnicity deeply troubled Raphael, a fellow Jew. Raphael was further puzzled over Kubrick's cryptic praise for Hitler, unable to decide if Kubrick was jesting. Raphael was equally puzzled by Kubrick's trashing of \"Schindler's List\". After Raphael mentioned \"Schindler’s List\", Kubrick replied: “Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about six million people who get killed. 'Schindler's List’ is about 600 who don’t.\" Kubrick's friend Steven Spielberg, the director of the film, disbelievingly responded that he \"didn't recognize the voice of Stanley\" in Raphael's interviews.\n\nThough some have said Kubrick disliked America, Michael Herr says that America was all he talked about and that he often thought of moving back. Herr wrote that Kubrick was sent VHS tapes from American friends of NFL Football, \"Seinfeld\", \"The Simpsons\", and other television shows that he could not get in the United Kingdom. Kubrick told Siskel that he was not anti-American and thought that America was a good country, though he did not think that Ronald Reagan was a good president. In the interview, he also predicted an economic meltdown worldwide by pointing out to Siskel that most of the major banks in the United States held dubious foreign bonds as collateral and huge third world loans treated as assets. Kubrick likened this to the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale about the \"Emperor's New Clothes\", and felt even during the Cold War, an economic collapse was more worrisome and imminent than nuclear annihilation was. As far as Kubrick's views on welfare and taxation, according to Ian Watson, Kubrick said of the pre-1997 Labour Party that \"If the Labourites ever get in, I’ll leave the country.\" Watson claims that Kubrick feared being ruined by tax-the-rich policies and was opposed to welfare in general.\n\nKubrick's earlier work is seen by Pauline Kael as more socially liberal than his later work. (She also viewed his early work much more favorably.) The early films embody liberal ideals, and the satire of government and military in \"Dr. Strangelove\" seems to point to a liberal political perspective. Similarly, film analyst Glenn Perusek thinks Kubrick's earlier \"Paths of Glory\" reflects a Rousseauist vision of man with natural human sympathy crushed by the artifice of society; later Kubrick films abandon that perspective. While Kael viewed \"Dr. Strangelove\" as a liberal film, Kagan disagrees, holding the film to be written from the point of view of a detached realist, lacking the overt liberalism of similar anti-war films of the era such as \"On the Beach\" or \"Fail-Safe\".\n\nKubrick's more mature works are more pessimistic and suspicious of the so-called innate goodness of mankind, and are critical of stances based on that positive assessment. For example, in \"A Clockwork Orange\", the police are as violent and vulgar as the droogs, and Kubrick depicts both the subversive liberal writer Mr. Alexander and the authoritarian status quo Minister of the Interior as manipulative and sinister. Kubrick commented regarding \"A Clockwork Orange\":\n\nMan isn't a noble savage, he's an ignoble savage. He is irrational, brutal, weak, silly, unable to be objective about anything where his own interests are involved—that about sums it up. I'm interested in the brutal and violent nature of man because it's a true picture of him. And any attempt to create social institutions on a false view of the nature of man is probably doomed to failure.\nHe went on to say:The idea that social restraints are all bad is based on a utopian and unrealistic vision of man. But in this movie, you have an example of social institutions gone a bit berserk. Obviously, social institutions faced with the law-and-order problem might choose to become grotesquely oppressive. The movie poses two extremes: it shows Alex in his precivilized state, and society committing a worse evil in attempting to cure him.\"\n\nWhen \"New York Times\" writer Fred M. Hechinger wrote a piece that declared \"A Clockwork Orange\" \"fascist\", Kubrick responded:\nIt is quite true that my film's view of man is less flattering than the one Rousseau entertained in a similarly allegorical narrative—but, in order to avoid fascism, does one have to view man as a noble savage rather than an ignoble one? Being a pessimist is not yet enough to qualify one to be regarded as a tyrant (I hope)... The age of the alibi, in which we find ourselves, began with the opening sentence of Rousseau's \"\": 'Nature made me happy and good, and if I am otherwise, it is society's fault.' It is based on two misconceptions: that man in his natural state was happy and good, and that primal man had no society... Rousseau's romantic fallacy that it is society which corrupts man, not man who corrupts society, places a flattering gauze between ourselves and reality. This view, to use Mr. Hechinger's frame of reference, is solid box office but, in the end, such a self-inflating illusion leads to despair.\n\nKubrick quoted extensively from Robert Ardrey, author of \"African Genesis\" and \"The Social Contract\"—not to be confused with Rousseau's—and author Arthur Koestler from his book \"The Ghost in the Machine\". Both authors (Koestler through psychology and Ardrey through anthropology and evolutionary theory) searched for the cause of humanity's capacity for death and destruction, and both, like Kubrick, were suspicious of the liberal belief in the innate goodness of mankind. Ardrey and Kubrick both attribute this belief to Rousseau, who, in Ardrey's words, \"Fathered the romantic fallacy\".\n\nWhen asked by Michel Ciment in an interview if he was an anarchist, Kubrick replied: \"I am certainly not an anarchist, and I don't think of myself as a pessimist. I believe very strongly in parliamentary democracy, and I am of the opinion that the power and authority of the State should be optimized and exercised only to the extent that is required to keep things \"civilized\".\"\n\nIn his interview with \"The New York Times\", Kubrick stated that his view of mankind's innate capacity for violence and terror was closer to those of Christianity than to humanism or Jewish theology, saying, \"I mean, it's essentially Christian theology anyway, that view of man.\"\n\nKubrick appeared to believe that freedom and social libertarianism is still worth pursuing even if mankind is ultimately ignoble, and that evil on the part of the individual—however undesirable—is still preferable in contrast to the evil of a totalitarian society. Kubrick said in an interview with Gene Siskel:\nTo restrain man is not to redeem him... I think the danger is not that authority will collapse, but that, finally, in order to preserve itself, it will become very repressive... Law and order is not a phony issue, not just an excuse for the Right to go further right.\n\nKubrick came from a secular family background and \"was known to have said that he was not really a Jew, he just happened to have two Jewish parents.\" Though his father's legal name was Jacob, he went by Jacques or Jack as a move towards American assimilation. When asked by Michel Ciment in an interview if he had a religious upbringing, Kubrick replied: \"No, not at all.\"\n\nIn Kubrick's interview with Craig McGregor, he said:\n\"2001\" would give a little insight into my metaphysical interests... I'd be very surprised if the universe wasn't full of an intelligence of an order that to us would seem God-like. I find it very exciting to have a semi-logical belief that there's a great deal to the universe we don't understand, and that there is an intelligence of an incredible magnitude outside the Earth. It's something I've become more and more interested in. I find it a very exciting and satisfying hope.\n\nWhen asked by Eric Nordern in Kubrick's interview with \"Playboy\" if \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" was a religious film, Kubrick elaborated:\nI will say that the God concept is at the heart of \"2001\" but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God. I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion galaxies in just the visible universe. Given a planet in a stable orbit, not too hot and not too cold, and given a few billion years of chance chemical reactions created by the interaction of a sun's energy on the planet's chemicals, it's fairly certain that life in one form or another will eventually emerge. It's reasonable to assume that there must be, in fact, countless billions of such planets where biological life has arisen, and the odds of some proportion of such life developing intelligence are high. Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are billions of planets in the universe not only where intelligent life is on a lower scale than man but other billions where it is approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of thousands of millions of years in advance of us. When you think of the giant technological strides that man has made in a few millennia—less than a microsecond in the chronology of the universe—can you imagine the evolutionary development that much older life forms have taken? They may have progressed from biological species, which are fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal machine entities—and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and spirit. Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence ungraspable by humans.\n\nIn the same interview, he also blames the poor critical reaction to \"2001\" as follows:\nPerhaps there is a certain element of the lumpen literati that is so dogmatically atheist and materialist and Earth-bound that it finds the grandeur of space and the myriad mysteries of cosmic intelligence anathema.\n\nIn a 1969 interview to American Cinematographer, Kubrick expressed his atheism when asked if there was an unseen cosmic intelligence or god behind the events in \"2001\":\nThe whole idea of god is absurd. If anything, \"2001\" shows that what some people call \"god\" is simply an acceptable term for their ignorance. What they don't understand, they call \"god\"... Everything we know about the universe reveals that there is no god. I chose to do Dr. [Arthur C.] Clarke's story as a film because it highlights a critical factor necessary for human evolution; that is, beyond our present condition. This film is a rejection of the notion that there is a god; isn't that obvious?\n\nHe also commented on people who saw religious or spiritual connotations in \"2001\":\nIt's simply not there, religion and spirituality. Sufficiently advanced beings could be capable of things we might not even be able to understand — though these things would all make perfect sense to an advanced civilization, I suspect that these people to whom you refer are simply calling what they don't understand in my film \"god\".\n\nIn an interview with William Kloman of \"The New York Times\", when asked why there is hardly any dialogue in \"2001\", Kubrick explained:\nI don't have the slightest doubt that to tell a story like this, you couldn't do it with words. There are only 46 minutes of dialogue scenes in the film, and 113 of non-dialogue. There are certain areas of feeling and reality—or unreality or innermost yearning, whatever you want to call it—which are notably inaccessible to words. Music can get into these areas. Painting can get into them. Non-verbal forms of expression can. But words are a terrible straitjacket. It's interesting how many prisoners of that straitjacket resent its being loosened or taken off. There's a side to the human personality that somehow senses that wherever the cosmic truth may lie, it doesn't lie in A, B, C, D. It lies somewhere in the mysterious, unknowable aspects of thought and life and experience. Man has always responded to it. Religion, mythology, allegories—it's always been one of the most responsive chords in man. With rationalism, modern man has tried to eliminate it, and successfully dealt some pretty jarring blows to religion. In a sense, what's happening now in films and in popular music is a reaction to the stifling limitations of rationalism. One wants to break out of the clearly arguable, demonstrable things which really are not very meaningful, or very useful or inspiring, nor does one even sense any enormous truth in them.\n\nStephen King recalled Kubrick calling him late at night while he was filming \"The Shining\" and Kubrick asked him, \"Do you believe in God?\" King said that he had answered in the affirmative, but has had three different versions of what happened next. One time, he said that Kubrick simply hung up on him. On other occasions, he claimed Kubrick said, \"I knew it\", and then hung up on him. On yet another occasion, King claimed that Kubrick said, before hanging up, \"No, I don't think there is a God.\" In more recent interviews, King has had yet another version of the \"God\" story, in which Kubrick calls King and asks him if he thinks ghost stories are optimistic because they all suggest there is life after death. King replies, \"What about hell?\" There is a pause and Kubrick says, \"I do not believe in hell.\"\n\nFinally, Katharina Kubrick Hobbs was asked by alt.movies.kubrick if Stanley Kubrick believed in God. Here is her response:\nHmm, tricky. I think he believed in \"something\", if you understand my meaning. He was a bit of a fatalist actually, but he was also very superstitious. Truly a mixture of nature and nurture. I don't know exactly what he believed, he probably would have said that no-one can really ever know for sure, and that it would be rather arrogant to assume that one could know. I asked him once after The Shining, if he believed in ghosts. He said that it would be nice if there \"were\" ghosts, as that would imply that there is something after death. In fact, I think he said, \"Gee I hope so.\"...He did not have a religious funeral service. He's not buried in consecrated ground. We always celebrated Christmas and had huge Christmas trees.\n\nIn \"Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures\", Jack Nicholson recalls that Kubrick said \"The Shining\" is an overall optimistic story because \"anything that says there's anything after death is ultimately an optimistic story.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "320379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320379", "title": "Rape of males", "text": "Rape of males\n\nA significant proportion of victims of rape or other sexual violence incidents is male. Historically, rape was thought to be, and defined as, a crime committed solely against women. This belief is still held in some parts of the world, but rape of males is now commonly criminalized and has been subject to more discussion than it was in the past. \n\nRape of males is still taboo, and has a negative connotation among heterosexual and homosexual men. Community and service providers often react to the sexual orientation of male victims and the gender of their perpetrators. It is difficult for a male victim, straight or gay, to report the sexual assault that was experienced by him, especially in a society with a strong masculine custom. They are afraid that people will doubt their sexual orientation and label them as gay, especially if raped by a male, or that they may be seen as un-masculine because they were a victim. A perception of being gay is also a motive for rape in many cases.\n\nMostly, male victims try to hide and deny their victimization, similar to female victims, unless they have serious physical injuries. Eventually, the male victims may be very vague in explaining their injuries when they are seeking medical or mental health services. \n\nThe research about male-victim rape only appeared less than 30 years ago, focusing mostly on male children. The studies of sexual assault in correctional facilities focusing specifically on the consequences of this kind of rape were available in the early 1980s, but nothing was available during the previous years. Most of the literature regarding rape and sexual assault focuses on female victims.\n\nOnly recently have some other forms of sexual violence against men been considered. In the 2010–2012 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (and a prior edition of this study completed in 2010), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) measured a category of sexual violence called \"being made to penetrate\" which captures instances in which victims were forced to or attempt to sexually penetrate someone (of either sex), either by physical force or coercion, or when the victim was intoxicated or otherwise unable to consent. The CDC found in the 2012 data that 1.715 million (up from 1.267 million in 2010) reported being \"made to penetrate\" another person in the preceding 12 months, similar to the 1.473 million (2010: 1.270 million) women who reported being raped in the same time period. The definitions of rape and \"made to penetrate\" in the CDC study were worded with extremely similar language.\n\nMale-on-male rape has been heavily stigmatized. According to psychologist Sarah Crome, fewer than 1 in 10 male-male rapes are reported. As a group, male rape victims reported a lack of services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime.\n\nSeveral studies argue that male-male prisoner rape, as well as female-female prisoner rape, are common types of rape which go unreported even more frequently than rape in the general population. The rape of men by men has been documented as a weapon of terror in warfare (see also War rape). In the case of the Syrian Civil War (2011–present), the male detainees experienced sexual abuse such as being forced to sit on a broken glass bottle, getting their genitals tied to a heavy bag of water, or being forced to watch the rape of another detainee by the officials.\n\nFemale-on-male rape is under-researched compared to other forms of sexual violence. Statistics on the prevalence of female-on-male sexual violence vary. One study (Hannon et al.) found 23.4% of women and 10.5% of men reported they were raped while 6.6% of women and 10.5% of men reported they were victims of attempted rape. A 2010–2012 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 86.5% of male rape victims reported only male perpetrators, (down from 93.3% in the previous study published in 2010). One in 17 men (5.9%) reported being made to penetrate at some point in their lives (up from 4.8% in 2010). The surveys also found that male victims often reported only female perpetrators in instances of being made to penetrate (2012: 78.5%, 2010: 79.2%), sexual coercion (2012: 81.6%, 2010: 83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (2012: 53.0%, 2010: 53.1%). A 2008 study of 98 men interviewed on the United States National Crime Victimization Survey found that nearly half of the men (46%) who reported some form of sexual victimization were victimized by women.\n\nRegarding female-on-male sexual misconduct, the US Dept. of Justice reports in its opening statement (page 5): \"An estimated 4.4% of prison inmates and 3.1% of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months.\" Regarding female-on-male sexual misconduct (page 25) it states: \"Among the 39,121 male prison inmates who had been victims of staff sexual misconduct, 69% reported sexual activity with female staff; an additional 16% reported sexual activity with both female and male staff (table 18).\" and \"Nearly two-thirds of the male jail inmates who had been victimized said the staff perpetrator was female (64%).\"\n\nMale victims of sexual abuse by females often face social, political, and legal double standards. The case of Cierra Ross' sexual assault of a man in Chicago gained national headlines and Ross was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and armed robbery with a bail set at $75,000. A similar case includes James Landrith, who was made to penetrate a female acquaintance in a hotel room while incapacitated from drinking, while his rapist cited the fact that she was pregnant to advise him not to struggle, as this might hurt the baby.\n\nSeveral widely publicized cases of female-on-male statutory rape in the United States involved school teachers having illegal sex with their underage students (see Mary Kay Letourneau and Debra Lafave). Male victims, including underage minors, have been forced to pay child support to their rapist when the rapist conceives a baby as a result of the rape (see, for example, \"Hermesmann v. Seyer\").\n\nBy masculine gender socialization, it is thought that males, even younger males, cannot be victims of rape, nor even that they are vulnerable. In some societies, it is considered shameful and unmanly if a male child cries, because the male stereotype depicts males as being able to protect themselves, which may not always be the case. Young boys may be weaker and vulnerable to perpetrators, who are usually stronger. The perpetrators can use whatever they have to abuse the child, including money or other bribes. An adult male may also be helpless to fight back, or fearful of doing so because of the possibility of being arrested for assault and/or battery due to social double standards regarding the use of force in self-defense between genders, in some cases of female perpetrators (this double standard is similar to the concern of male self-defense against non-sexual assault by a female).\n\nA common societal belief is that a male must be aroused if he gets an erection or has an orgasm, therefore that means that they are willing and enjoying any sexual activity. Roy J. Levin and Willy Van Berlo wrote in an article in the Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine that slight genital stimulation or stress can create erections \"even though no specific sexual stimulation is present\". An erection does not mean that the men consent to sex. Males can get erections even in traumatic or painful sexual situations, and this does not indicate consent.\n\nMuch like female erectile response, male erectile response is involuntary, meaning that a man need not be aroused for his penis to become erect; mechanical stimulation is all that is necessary. Arousal and stimulation are distinct things. Stimulation is a physical response to a stimulus. Men can be physically stimulated without feeling aroused and thus causing an erection. Men can be scared and intimidated into an erection, especially if the person is older or an authority.\n\nOne notion is that males are less traumatized by the abuse experience than females are; this includes the belief that males are less negatively affected. Studies show that the long-term effects are damaging for either sex and males may especially be more damaged by social stigma and disbelief of their victimization. It is noted by Eogan and Richardson that male victims tend to feel more intense anger than female victims, while both go through similar feelings of distress after the rape. Frazier (1993) studied 74 male and 1,380 female rape victims. She found that the depression and hostility are more profound on male victims immediately post-rape than on female victims.\n\nTrauma recovery counselor Stephanie Baird says men who experience sexual attention as children often explain it to themselves as \"I'm a stud, I got laid by ...\". Baird explains that they do this in order to feel as if they had some power and say. Carpenter (2009, citing Mezey, 1987) finds that the \"male coping strategy characterized by denial and control renders them more prone to later psychiatric problems and reduces the likelihood of seeking help\".\n\nHenry Leak, the chairman of the Survivors organization, stated that rape of males, as with females, has more to do with power than sexuality, and does not only happen inside the homosexual community. Sexual orientation is a complex issue, and the majority of male perpetrators who seek out boys are not homosexual.\n\nMale sexual assault victims often fear being seen as gay or weak, or believe that their assault may be due to their appearance being effeminate or homosexual so as to attract other males. Experts do not believe that premature sexual experiences play a significant role in later sexual orientation. Research by Jane Gilgun, Judith Becker and John Hunter states that while many perpetrators may have experienced sexual abuse of their own, most sexual assault victims will not go on to become adolescent perpetrators.\n\nRape of males during wartime has been reported as being very prevalent in some parts of the world, such as Democratic Republic of Congo. Many male refugees who have escaped from the civil war in Congo to Uganda have been raped. Across Africa, men who are raped often face social stigmatization, accusations of homosexuality (which is illegal in many countries of the region), and being ridiculed for being \"weak\" and failing to prevent the rape. In northern Uganda, in recent years there have been ongoing attacks by rebel groups against the government forces. During these conflicts, civilian men have often been attacked, kidnapped, raped and forced to fight for the rebel groups.\n\nSexual abuse results in severe emotional and often physical trauma. Among sexual assault victims over 18, 31.5% of females and 16.1% of males said that they incurred non-genital injuries from the assault.\n\nMale victims received more ancillary injuries and were more likely to be threatened with a weapon by the perpetrator. The symptoms and injuries most frequently noted are tension headaches, ulcers, nausea, colitis, abrasions to the throat, black eyes and broken bones. The study by Stermac and colleagues (2004) noted that 45% of male survivors who went to a hospital sexual assault centre had some type of physical injury (25% soft tissue injury, 20% lacerations).\n\nThe data from hospital emergency rooms show that male rape victims are more likely to have non-genital injuries than females, and that they are more likely to neglect seeking medical attention if the injuries are not significant. Hodge and Canter (1998) report that homosexual male victims are more likely to sustain serious injuries than heterosexual male victims. Sometimes victims become infected by a sexually transmitted disease as the result of rape, but it is infrequent and includes only a small portion of male victims.\n\nRape victims, males and females, may find it difficult to report the sexual assault against them. There is a myth that a male sexual assault victim will become a perpetrator themselves. This myth is very damaging to victims, both to their mental states and to how people treat them. Elizabeth Donovan, a psychotherapist, stated that males have the added burden of facing a society that does not believe that rape can happen to them at all.\n\nSince most studies have found that people tend to blame the victim of rape for the incident, a study called \"Gender Differences in Attributions of Blame for Male Rape Victims\" in the \"Journal of Interpersonal Violence\" focused on where the blame lies in rape cases. In cases of female rape victims, a higher proportion of males than females tend to blame the victim for the sexual assault. In order to show whether male or female respondents blamed the rape victim at a higher rate, this study utilized a story of a man being raped to see if the blame was placed on the victim or the assaulter. After performing the experiment, researchers found that a statistically significant proportion of males tend to blame the victim, even when the rape victim is a male. This study implies that even in cases of male sexual victimization, the male victims are held responsible for the assault by the majority of the uninvolved population.\n\nCompared to men who have not been sexually assaulted, men who were sexually assaulted before age 18 have a greater risk of having mental health problems, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression; alcoholism and drug abuse; suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts; problems in intimate relationships; and underachievement at school and at work.\n\nBecause of gender expectations, being a male child victim of sexual abuse can lead to:\n\nThe suicide rate for sexually abused males is 14 to 15 times higher than for other males. McDonald and Tijerino found in their research that some participants state that there were occasions on which they felt so bad that they engaged in self-harming behaviors, including suicide attempts, and/or had suicidal thoughts. There is also a study that shows that rape victims are 4.1 times more likely to contemplate suicide and 13 times more likely to attempt suicide than non-crime victims.\n\nMales have a much higher rate of completed suicide than females. One common explanation relies on the social constructions of hegemonic masculinity and femininity. In a review of the literature on gender and suicide, male suicide rates were explained in terms of traditional gender roles. Male gender roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, and risk-taking behavior. Reinforcement of this gender role often prevents males from seeking help for suicidal feelings and depression.\n\nSexual assault victims need extensive emotional and psychological healing after the raping, but male survivors are not likely to speak out their cases. Elizabeth Donovan, a psychotherapist, said; \"Males have the added burden of facing a society that doesn't believe rape can happen to them ... at all.\"\n\nThe CDC reports in 2010 stated that nearly 1 in 5 women, 1 in 71 men in the U.S. have been raped or have had an experience of attempted rape, while 4.8% of men reported they were made to penetrate someone else at some time in their lives. Incidents of sexual violence in US are severely underreported, especially among male victims, that lead to an assumption that the actual number is likely higher. Despite these numbers, the FBI reports that instances of rape have declined.\n\nStephanie Baird, a trauma recovery counselor, cited the \"hot-for-teacher or babysitter complex\" that is a popular motif in modern American culture. The culture makes it more difficult for a male adolescent to even recognize that he is being abused. She explained that \"consent\" means \"being of age, mind, sound body to make an informed decision about whether one would like to become sexually intimate with the other person\", while children cannot consent.\n\nThe most recent UK government statistics estimated about 78,000 people in the UK have become rape or attempted rape victims, and about 9,000 are men. Research suggests that the notoriously low report rate is particularly true among male victims. About 1,250 incidents of male-victim rape were reported to the police in 2011–2012. In February 2014, the ministry of justice set aside £500,000 to provide counseling and support for sexually abused males.\n\nIn 1978 in the UK, Joyce McKinney was sentenced to 12 months in prison for forcing a man to have sex with her while chained up.\n\nThe rape of males over the age of 14 is not a criminal offence in the People's Republic of China (though a November 2015 revision of the law provided that these acts could be prosecuted under the lesser offence of \"forcible indecency\"). Consequently, no official statistics are collected. However, the United Nations' 2013 \"Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific\" found that 3% of Chinese men surveyed acknowledged having been raped by another man during their lifetime (suggesting that the proportion of male rapes as a percentage of all rapes was 14.4%).\n\nAccording to research by the University of Hong Kong and UBS Optimus Foundation, sexual assault rates of boys are 2.7% higher than girls.\n\nTaiwan counted 12,066 victims of reported sexual assault in 2012 of which 1,335 victims were men. The Ministry of Interior showed that 7,608 minors were rape or sexual assault victims, with 1,063 of them being boys. To prevent the increasing number of these crimes, Taiwan's Ministry of Education had released a short film on sexual education. The netizens (Internet users) and students of Taiwan are treating it as a subject of jokes. However, National Academy of Educational Research Secretary-General Kuo Kung-pin stated that the video has achieved its purpose to get attention from the youth to remind them that men can be raped as well.\n\nThe rape of males in India is commonly reported. For this reason, some activists and research organizations, including Jai Vipra at the New Delhi think-tank Centre for Civil Society, argue that the phrasing of rape laws should be gender neutral. This view is opposed by some human rights advocates and women's rights activists. Mumbai-based human rights lawyer Flavia Agnes told the \"India Times\", \"I oppose proposal [sic] to make rape laws gender-neutral. We had opposed it when the government made child rape laws gender-neutral ... If made gender-neutral, rape laws will not have the deterrence value and it will make it more complicated for judges in court.\" International human rights lawyer and activist Vrinda Grover was quoted in the same article: \"There are no instances of women raping men. I don't think men are facing serious sexual violence as [sic] women. Consider the brutality and intensity of sexual violence against women.\"\n\nThe news about rape of males in Indonesia arouses astonishment or jokes. The Indonesian Child Protection Commission (\"Komisi Perlindungan Anak Indonesia\" -KPAI) records about 400 Indonesian children become victims of sexual assault per year, both by their families and other adults. According to the Secretary General of KPAI, Erlinda, \"the majority of children who are victims of sexual violence are males, because boys are vulnerable to become the victims of sexual offenders because they are easily persuaded by the perpetrators who are pedophiles.\n\nEmayartini (2013) became the first Indonesian woman to be sentenced to prison because she had raped six teenage boys. She almost escaped the law after she was considered to have a mental disorder. Unlike male rapists, she was subjected to the Law Number 23 Year 2002 about Child Protection, rather than the laws against rape.\n\nThe FBI's Uniform Crime Report in 2012 redefined rape as: \"The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\" The prior definition had not changed since 1927 and gained the attention of sexual assault awareness groups because it had alienated the victims who did not fit the definition – \"the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will\". The former definition of \"forcible rape\" focused on vaginal penetration, but the newer definition includes forcible anal or oral penetration. The old definition, \"the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will\", did not include forcible oral or anal penetration, the rape of women with other objects, or the rape of a man.\n\nThis new definition encourages male rape victims to seek the help they need and also includes sexual assaults that previously were not covered by the definition of rape. The basis for changing this definition lies in the statistics provided by governmental institutions such as the U.S. Department of Justice and the CDC. A study done by the CDC found that 1 in 71 men had been raped or had been the target of attempted rape. This study included oral and anal penetration in its definition and did not include men in prison. Gender-neutral laws have combated the perception that rape rarely occurs to men, and other laws have eliminated the term \"rape\" altogether.\n\nPreviously, English law did not include rape of males as a criminal offense and it was recorded as non-consensual buggery. A convicted rapist (of a female) could be imprisoned for life, stated Henry Leak, the chairman of Survivors organization, while buggery only carried 10 years maximum as a sentence. This is however no longer the case; the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 s. 142 was the first to lead this development and recognize male-victim rape; and the Sexual Offences Act 2003 states that penetration of the \"mouth, anus or vagina with [the defendant's] penis\" is sufficient for rape at s. 1(1)(a). \"R v Ismail\" [2005] All ER 216 further prevented distinction between \"mouth, anus or vagina\" when sentencing. Under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 and the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 men can be both perpetrators and victims. However, in neither England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland can a female be legally charged with 'rape' (she must be instead charged with other offenses such as sexual assault, assault by penetration, or causing sexual activity without consent, of which the latter two carry the same maximum sentence).\n\nBefore 2015, article 236 of the revised Criminal Law of China specifies that the crime of rape may be committed only against women. It protects women's right to sexual autonomy but not men's. In 2011, the first-ever conviction for sexual assault on a man occurred with a Beijing security guard as the perpetrator, but he was convicted of intentional injury rather than rape, sentenced to one year in prison and to pay 20,000 yuan ($3,026) as compensation. A convicted rapist will get at least three years in prison.\n\nThe guidelines of China on child protection strengthen the punishments for sexual offenses against underage girls, but don't offer equal protection to underage boys. Molestation of both sexes is treated equally at present, but the rapists of boys can only be charged with child molestation with 5 years in prison as a maximum sentence. In September 2013, 27 NGOs called for the law to give equal protection to boys below 18 years old in cases of sexual offences.\n\nUntil November 1, 2015, sexual offences against males above the age of 14 could not be prosecuted unless they also included a physical assault, in which case only the physical component was punishable. However, a revision of Article 237, which criminalises \"forcible indecency,\" made that section of the law gender-neutral. Offences that constitute rape of males may be tried under this article, with offenders facing a maximum of five years in prison.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code, Section 377, is the only section that criminalizes all acts of nonconsensual carnal intercourse, including male-on-male rape.\n\nThis section penalizes both consensual and forced sodomy with 10 years minimum to life imprisonment. The Delhi HC stated that Section 377 of Indian Penal Code will continue to govern non-consensual penile, non-vaginal sex and penile non-vaginal sex involving minors. The section can be evoked to punish sodomites, pedophiles and zoophiles.\n\nThe rape definition in Section 375 of Indian Penal Code does not include rape in which males are the victims. The Indian government (2012) decided to change the definition of \"rape\" as forcible penetration to include male victims, but was criticized on the grounds that this would further harm the interests of female rape victims.\n\nIn the 2013 Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, rape and sexual harassment crimes were gender neutral. The term \"rape\" was removed and substituted with \"sexual assault\". But strong objections were raised by feminist groups that made the Indian government decided to restore the term \"rape\" and state that only men can be the rapists of women.\n\nBased on \"Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana\" (Indonesian's Penal Code), males cannot be the victims of rape. In paragraph 285, rape is defined as a sexual violence against a female having a sentence of imprisonment for a maximum of 12 years, while in paragraph 289, the victim of \"vulgar actions\" is not defined as male or female and the punishment is a maximum of 9 years imprisonment. The commentary on paragraph 285 by R. Soesilo stated that the law makers didn't need to determine the punishment for a female perpetrator that forced males to have intercourse with her. This is not because such action is not possible, but the act is deemed to not do harm or result in something bad to male victims, such as pregnancy in females.\n\nPrior to the 1997 amendment of Revised Penal Code of 1930, male victims of rape were not acknowledged under Philippine law. Article 266-A of the law defines rape by \"an act of sexual assault\" by any person either by \"inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice\" or inserting \"any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person\".The 1997 amendment allowed the legal recognition of rape of males, both by other males and by females.\n\nMale victims of rape are not acknowledged in Singapore law. A male rape victim is not considered a rape victim under S375(1) of Penal Code, which defines rape as the act of a man penetrating a woman's vagina with his penis without her consent. Penetration of other body orifices is not rape but an unlawful sexual penetration (S376(1), Penal Code). Both crimes carry the same penalty: imprisonment for a term of up to 20 years plus fine or caning. (S375(2) and S376(4), Penal Code).\n\n"}

She was arrested in Hong Kong in 2000 and extradited back to the United States in 2003. She was held in U.S. Federal prison until her death in 2014. Nicknamed \"The Mother of All Snakeheads\", a translation of the Chinese word for \"smuggler,\" her legacy is debated, with many Chinese immigrants in New York praising her actions and her generosity toward her fellow Chinese in the United States.\n\nPing was born January 9th, 1949 in the poor farming village of Shengmei, Fuzhou (\"Prospering Beauty\") in northern Fujian province, China. Ping's father, Cheng Chai Leung, who was from Shengmei, and mother, who was from a neighboring village, had five children in all. Ping was 10 months old when Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China. She attended the village elementary school as a child and worked on the family farm, helping raise pigs and rabbits, chopping wood, and tending a vegetable garden. According to Ping's biographer, Patrick Radden Keefe, who interviewed her in 2008, Ping said that as a girl of twelve years old she survived the capsizing of a rowboat in which she had been traveling to another village to cut wood for kindling. She recalled of the incident that all of the people in the boat who had been rowing and had been holding an oar when the boat turned over managed to survive, while \"the two people who were lazy and sat back while others worked ended up dead. This taught me to work hard.\" Ping also said that during the Cultural Revolution, she became a leader of the Red Guard in her village.\n\nWhen she was fifteen, her father left the family and traveled to the United States as a merchant marine crewman. He stayed in the U.S. for thirteen years, working as a dish-washer and sending money home to the family every few months. He was apprehended by U.S. immigration authorities and deported back to China in 1977. When he returned to China, Ping's father entered into the business of people smuggling.\n\nSister Ping married a man from a neighboring village, Cheung Yick Tak, in 1969. They had a daughter, Cheung \"Monica\" Hui Mui, in 1973; Ping later had three sons. The family moved to Hong Kong in 1974, where Ping became a successful businesswoman and opened a factory in Shenzhen, China. In June 1981, with the help from an elderly couple, Ping successfully applied to be a nanny in New York and the family passed through Canada, and on 17 November 1981, they settled in Chinatown, Manhattan, in the United States, where they opened a shop, the Tak Shun Variety Store, which catered to homesick Fuzhounese immigrants. During her time in New York, Ping lived at 14 Monroe Street, Knickerbocker Village, a modest lower middle class development.\n\nSister Ping began her smuggling career in the early 1980s as a one-woman operation, smuggling handfuls of fellow villagers from China into the United States a few at a time by commercial airline using forged identification documents. She charged $35,000 or more to transport interested immigrants into the United States.\n\nIn the spring of 1989, evidence against Sister Peng was gathered in sting by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Toronto International Airport. Several months later, Ping was arrested and pleaded guilty to alien smuggling. She was sentenced to six months in prison in Butler County, Pennsylvania. As she spoke little English, she was isolated from other prisoners and readily agreed to provide a Chinese-speaking FBI agent with information on Chinatown's underworld, she received a reduced sentence and served four months.\n\nBusiness picked up after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 when the U.S. government offered Chinese students present in the United States at the time the opportunity to stay. Thousands flooded into the country from abroad using false papers to establish a claim to residency under the new rule.\n\nOn June 6, 1993 the Golden Venture ship ran aground in Queens, New York with 286 illegal immigrants onboard. One of the criminal leaders, Guo Liang Chi, named Ping as an investor. In December 1994, an indictment was brought before a Manhattan federal court, stating that Ping had smuggled around 3,000 Fujianese to the United States since 1984 with the help of the American-Chinese gang Fuk Ching. Sometimes hundreds of people were smuggled in at a time via cargo ship and imprisoned below deck for months at a time with little food and water. In 1998, one of the smaller boats Sister Ping used for offloading customers from a larger vessel capsized off the coast of Guatemala, drowning fourteen.\n\nSister Ping hired scores of people in several different countries to move her human cargo for her, hold them hostage until their smuggling fees were paid, and collect those fees from them. Sometimes her customers were lucky and arrived safely in the United States where they paid the exorbitant fees Sister Ping charged, and were released.\n\nTo ensure her customers paid their smuggling fees, Sister Ping hired armed thugs from the Fuk Ching, Chinatown’s most vicious and feared gang, to transport and guard her customers in the United States. The presence of these gang members guaranteed that Sister Ping got paid the $25,000 to $45,000 fee she demanded for the trip.\n\nSister Ping also ran a money transmitting business out of her Chinatown variety store.\n\nIndividuals who conducted such Chinese alien smuggling operations are known as \"snakeheads\" from the Chinese translation for human-smuggler. Almost all of the immigrants whom Sister Ping harbored came from Fujian province. She was renowned as the most notorious snakehead, operating the largest, most sophisticated operation of its kind, which became international in scale. The U.S. Department of Justice declared at her sentencing that \"Sister Ping is one of the first, and ultimately most successful, alien smugglers of all time.\" It is estimated that Ping amassed around $40 million.\n\nIn 1994, Sister Ping was invited to Beijing, China along with other overseas notables of Fujianese descent to celebrate an anniversary celebration of the Communist Party. She was arrested when she arrived but according to police and friends, she paid bribes to escape custody. Later in December 1994, Ping learned of the US indictment and she fled, returning to China where she continued her business.\n\nThe FBI and INS spent the following five years attempting to apprehend her, but she was believed to reside mainly in China, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. On April 17, 2000 Interpol searched passenger lists for flights from Hong Kong to New York, they found her son's name. More than 40 agents from the Hong Kong narcotics bureau waited at the airport, apprehended her at around noon and she was fingerprinted and arrested. At the time Ping was carrying three passports, including a fake Belize one with her photo but in the name of Lilly Zheng. She fought extradition but was eventually sent back to New York in July 2003 and held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn\n\nAfter a jury trial before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York she was convicted in June 2005 on three separate counts, including one count of conspiring to commit alien smuggling, hostage taking, money laundering and trafficking in ransom proceeds and sentenced to 35 years in prison. \n\nPing was interviewed in Danbury in June 2013 and said, “Being locked up for over 10 years allowed me to think about my previous life, my heart calmed down and I started to feel that jail was the safest place for me. I keep telling myself not to think much about the future and live life by the moment.\" She also said \"I cannot believe they jailed me for 35 years! 35 years! In a way I was killed by the FBI agents and tainted witnesses.\".\n\nSister Ping served part of her sentence in Federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut (BOP #05117-055). In 2013, it was announced that Danbury would be reverted to a male-only facility and Ping was transferred to FMC Carswell, Texas in April 2014. On arrival, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\n\nPing's health had deteriorated in prison, with high cholesterol and blood lipids; she lost 17 pounds in the last two years of her life.Aged 65, Ping died quietly at noon on April 24, 2014, surrounded by her family at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, in Texas.\n\nHer funeral took place on May 23, 2014 at the Boe Fook Funeral Home on Canal Street in Manhattan with thousands of mourners. Reports stated that funeral wreaths were adorned with words 'hero' and 'modern day Robin Hood' highlighting how revered she was in Chinatown. An online news report of Sister Ping's funeral also shows the large number of tributes.\n\nHer body was laid to rest at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla.\n\nSister Ping and the Golden Venture are the subject of Patrick Radden Keefe's 2009 book, \"The Snakehead\". \n\nThe \"Golden Venture\" disaster and the lives of some of the passengers are the subject of Peter Cohn's 2006 documentary \"Golden Venture\".\n\nIn August 2016, it was reported that a motion picture entitled \"The Snakehead\" had been nine years in the making, written and directed by Evan Jackson Leong. The film has not yet been released.\n\n"}

He had three sisters, although only one, Elinor, survived until adulthood. De Vere's other siblings were; Horatio, William and Vere Edmond.\n\nIn 1847, he took passage in one of the infamous \"coffin ships\" that transported Irish emigrants fleeing the Irish Potato Famine to British North America and the United States, wanting to see for himself the horrendous conditions that were leading to the deaths of so many of these passengers. He composed a withering report on his voyage now known as \"The Elgin-Grey Papers\". When Colonial Secretary Earl Grey read this report, he forwarded it to Lord Elgin, Governor-General of Upper Canada and Lower Canada in the hope that these inhumane conditions could be improved. The Passenger Act of 1847 made \"coffin ships\" illegal, though many still operated.\nDe Vere became a Roman Catholic in 1847, and defended the re-creation of the English Catholic hierarchy in 1851. He was a Liberal Party MP for Limerick County from 1854 to 1859, and was appointed High Sheriff of County Limerick in 1870.\n\nStephen Edward became 4th Baronet of Curragh in 1880 when his oldest brother, Vere Edmond, 3rd Baronet, died with no male heir. The Hunt/de Vere family estate for 300 years (1657–1957), including the period of the Baronetcy of Curragh, is the present day Curraghchase Forest Park, in County Limerick. Before becoming the 4th Baronet, Stephen had built a smaller house in the 1850s on Foynes Island in the River Shannon, adjacent to the port town of Foynes, less than from Curraghchase. There he wrote poems, political pamphlets and translated several editions of the works of Horace, considered by some as the best English translation of Horace's verses.\n\nHe built a Gothic church in Foynes, and is buried beside it. On his death in 1904 the baronetcy became extinct. He never married and his estate, together with that of his unmarried brother Aubrey, went to their nephew Aubrey Vere O'Brien, while the Foynes Island farm went to their other nephew, Robert Vere O'Brien.\n\n"}

{"id": "312785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312785", "title": "Wilhelm Kempff", "text": "Wilhelm Kempff\n\nWilhelm Walter Friedrich Kempff (25 November 1895 – 23 May 1991) was a German pianist and composer. Although his repertoire included Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt and Brahms, Kempff was particularly well known for his interpretations of the music of Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert, recording the complete sonatas of both composers. He is considered to have been one of the chief exponents of the Germanic tradition during the 20th century and one of the greatest pianists of all time.\n\nKempff was born in Jüterbog, Brandenburg, in 1895. He grew up in nearby Potsdam where his father was a royal music director and organist at St. Nicolai Church. His grandfather was also an organist and his brother Georg became director of church music at the University of Erlangen. Kempff studied music at first at the Berlin Hochschule für Musik at the age of nine after receiving lessons from his father at a younger age. Whilst there he studied composition with Robert Kahn and piano with Karl Heinrich Barth (with whom Arthur Rubinstein also studied). In 1914 Kempff moved on to study at the Viktoria gymnasium in Potsdam before returning to Berlin to finish his training.\n\nIn 1917, Kempff gave his first major recital, consisting of predominantly major works, including Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata and Brahms Variations on a theme of Paganini. Kempff toured widely in Europe and much of the rest of the world. Between 1936 and 1979 he performed ten times in Japan (a small Japanese island was named \"Kenpu-san\" in his honor). Kempff made his first London appearance in 1951 and his first in New York in 1964. He gave his last public performance in Paris in 1981, and then retired for health reasons (Parkinson's Disease). He died in Positano, Italy, in 1991 at the age of 95, five years after his wife, whom he had married in 1926. They were survived by seven children.\n\nWilhelm Kempff recorded over a period of some sixty years. His recorded legacy includes works of Schumann, Brahms, Schubert, Mozart, Bach, Liszt, Chopin and particularly, of Beethoven.\nHe was the first to record the complete sonatas of Franz Schubert, long before these works became popular. (For Schubert sonatas which were left incomplete, Kempff recorded only the completed movements and not the fragments.) He also recorded two sets of the complete Beethoven sonatas (and one early, almost complete set on shellac (1926–1945), one in mono (1951–1956) and the other in stereo (1964–1965). He recorded the complete Beethoven piano concertos twice as well, both with the Berlin Philharmonic; the first from the early 1950s in mono with Paul van Kempen, and the later in stereo from the early 1960s with Ferdinand Leitner. Kempff also recorded chamber music with Yehudi Menuhin, Pierre Fournier, Wolfgang Schneiderhan, Paul Grummer, and Henryk Szeryng, among others.\n\nHe left recordings of most of his repertory, including the complete sonatas of Beethoven and Schubert. He performed to an advanced age, continuing to give concerts past his eightieth birthday. His association with the Berlin Philharmonic spanned over sixty years.\n\nAs a performer Kempff stressed lyricism and spontaneity in music, particularly effective in intimate pieces or passages. He always strove for a singing, lyrical quality. He avoided extreme tempos and display for its own sake.\n\nThe pianist Alfred Brendel has written that Kempff \"played on impulse... it depended on whether the right breeze, as with an aeolian harp, was blowing. You then would take something home that you never heard elsewhere.\" (in Brendel's book, \"The Veil of Order\"). He regards Kempff as the \"most rhythmical\" of his colleagues. Brendel helped choose the selections for Phillip's \"Great Pianists of the 20th Century\" issue of Kempff recordings, and wrote in the notes that Kempff \"achieves things that are beyond him\" in his \"unsurpassable\" recording of Liszt's first Legende, \"St. Francis Preaching to the Birds.\"\n\nWhen pianist Artur Schnabel undertook his pioneering complete recording of the Beethoven sonatas in the 1930s, he told EMI that if he didn't complete the cycle, they should have Kempff complete the remainder – even though the two pianists took noticeably different approaches to the composer (for example, Schnabel preferred extremely fast or slow tempos, while Kempff preferred moderate ones). Later, when Kempff was in Finland, the composer Jean Sibelius asked him to play the slow movement of Beethoven's 29th Sonata, the Hammerklavier; after Kempff finished, Sibelius told him, \"You did not play that as a pianist but rather as a human being.\"\n\nFrom 1924 to 1929, Kempff took over the direction of the Stuttgart College of Music as a successor of Max Pauer. In 1931, he was co-founder of the summer courses at Marmorpalais Potsdam. In 1957, Kempff founded Fondazione Orfeo (today: Kempff Kulturstiftung) in the south-Italian city Positano and held his first Beethoven interpretation masterclass at Casa Orfeo, which Kempff had built especially for this reason. He continued teaching there once a year until 1982. His wife died in 1986. After his death in 1991, Gerhard Oppitz taught the courses from 1992–1995, followed by John O’Conor until 2011 and from 2013 onwards Bernd Goetzke. Oppitz and O'Conor had both been outstanding participants of Kempff's masterclasses and were personally closely connected with Wilhelm Kempff. Like his predecessors Bernd Goetzke is a former participant of the courses in Positano.\n\nOther noted pianists to have studied with Kempff include Jörg Demus, Norman Shetler, Mitsuko Uchida, Peter Schmalfuss, Idil Biret and Ventsislav Yankov.\n\nA lesser-known activity of Kempff was composing. He composed for almost every genre and used his own cadenzas for Beethoven's Piano Concertos 1–4. His student Idil Biret has recorded a CD of his piano works. His second symphony premiered in 1929 at the Leipzig Gewandhaus by Wilhelm Furtwängler. He also prepared a number of Bach transcriptions, including the Siciliano from the Flute Sonata in E-flat major, that have been recorded by Kempff and others. His opera \"Famile Gozzi\", a comic work in three acts, was written in 1934.\n\n\nAmong many others:\n\n"}
