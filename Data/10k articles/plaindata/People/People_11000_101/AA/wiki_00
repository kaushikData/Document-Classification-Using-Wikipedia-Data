By 2000, Meadows had left his role of CFO at a publicly traded insurance company and launched the Burghound.com site, which offers subscribers newsletters with reviews of Burgundy wine and California and Oregon Pinot noir wines. Meadows also regularly speaks on Burgundy and other wine subjects. Burghound.com also organizes wine events such as the Asia Symphony of Wine and Flavours - Burghound in Asia, which is held in Singapore.\n\nWithin a relatively short time following its launch, and despite a relatively high cost of subscription, the service came to be viewed by many as \"the definitive word on matters Burgundian\", and Meadows \"a leading Burgundy critic\".\n\nAmong the reasons cited for the success of Burghound.com are that Meadows already held a strong online discussion-group reputation, and that Robert Parker had ceased to cover Burgundy for \"The Wine Advocate\" in 1996, and delegated coverage of the region to Pierre Rovani with limited success, providing an opening for Meadows. As Parker already had strained relations with the Burgundy wine community, wine critics of global coverage such as Stephen Tanzer and Clive Coates were perceived to dominate the field. It has been suggested that the Burghound coverage of the 2005 vintage of Burgundy did as much to Meadows' reputation as 1982 Bordeaux did for Robert Parker.\n\nIn 2010, Meadows and his wife Erica released a book by way of self-publishing, titled \"The Pearl of the Côte\" on the subject of the history and vineyards of Vosne-Romanée, while opting not to list the book on channels such as Amazon.com.\n\n\n"}

He attended the University of Calabar where he gained a BSc in Sociology, the University of Cambridge where he gained a Master of Philosophy in Criminology, and the University of Edinburgh where he earned a PhD in Criminology.\n\nAgozino has been editor of the \"Interdisciplinary Research Series in Ethnic, Gender and Class Relations\" series of books from Ashgate Publishing. His 1997 \"Black Women and the Criminal Justice System: Towards the Decolonisation of Victimisation\" was the first of these. By 2008 over two dozen books had been published in the series. \nHe was appointed editor-in-chief of the \"African Journal of Criminology and Justice Studies\" and a member of the editorial board of \"Jenda: A Journal of West African Women's Studies and Culture\".\nAgozino is a founding member of the international governing council of the Lagos-based think tank the \"Centre for Democracy and Development\". In 2007, Agozino was appointed criminology unit coordinator and professor in sociology at the University of the West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nAgozino's work explores the past and present impact of colonisation on the way in which racial and ethnic minorities are treated by justice systems worldwide.\nHis work develops a postcolonial perspective in African criminology.\nAgozino challenges the criminology discipline to \"decolonize\" its theories and methods and to undo the harm that has been done.\nIn his introduction to Gabbidon's 2007 \"W.E.B. Du Bois on crime and justice\", Agozino notes that \"excessive punitiveness\" in the criminal justice systems of the US, UK, South Africa and Russia has been increasing rather than reducing the problem of crime. He also noted the hypocrisy of British and American leaders in calling Nelson Mandela a terrorist as he was struggling with the terrorist apartheid regime in South Africa.\nHis work is theoretical in nature, discussing the development of criminology in western countries and their impact on non-western societies, particularly former colonies. It has rejuvenated the colonial perspective on race and crime.\n\nIn his 1997 \"Black women and the criminal justice system\" Agozino notes the roles of race and ethnicity in negotiation of power within prison, where coloured people are greatly under-represented among prison officers and over-represented among inmates. He does not discuss the importance, at least in England, of the factors of class and geography.\nHis book also discusses fixed political positions on types of crime. He notes that when US Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders said the government should seriously look into the experience of countries that had decriminalised drug addiction she was dismissed from her job by President Bill Clinton.\n\nA review of Agozino's 2003 book \"Counter-Colonial Criminology: A Critique of Imperialist Reason\" concluded: \".., this is a book that deserves to be on all criminological reading lists, and it would be at home in any African centred studies course. It offers a generous amount of scholarly inquiry into an area that has paid scant attention to African and other “people of color’s” perspectives in the criminological discourse. It is therefore groundbreaking and a must read\".\nAnother review of this book talked about the \"complexity and creativity of this angry yet optimistic work\".\nA third review said \"Henceforth, criminology will no longer concentrate in the study of crime and criminals, but will also include the study of justice\".\n\n"}

Since the Crimean War (1854–56), the demand for grain had pushed up the price of Algerian wheat to European levels. Storage silos were emptied when the world market's impact was felt in Algeria, and Muslim farmers sold their grain reserves — including seed grain — to French speculators. When serious drought struck Algeria and grain crops failed in 1866 and for several years following, Muslim areas faced starvation, and with famine also came pestilence. It was estimated that 20% of the Muslim population of Constantine died over a three-year period. In 1871 the civil authorities repudiated guarantees made to tribal chieftains by the previous military government for loans to replenish their seed supply. This act alienated even pro-French Muslim leaders, while it undercut their ability to control their people. It was against this background of misery and hopelessness that the stricken Kabyles rose in revolt.\n\nMohand at-AMokrane was the son of Ahmed AMokrane one of the governors (Bachagha) of the area of Medjana located in the highlands of Kabylie, who was also the cheikh of Rahmania order. After the death of Ahmed -AMokrane, the French authorities appointed Mohand in his place. However following dissension with the French administration, he resigned from his position in March 1871. This conflict happened as a result of the colonial authorities disregarding at-aMokrane, creating a French-populated commune of Bordj Bou Arréridj and appointing a French officer as its head. The great many discontented flocked to the banners of the Cheikh aggrieved by the ravages of famine, increasing racial oppression by the French and Christianization policy pursued by the Catholic church.\n\nIn March 1871 Mohamed El-Mokrani revolted against French by carrying out his army until Bordj- Bou -Arréridj with the assistance of his brother oumezrag and his cousin El Hadj Bouzid, and Sheikh mohand ameziane AHaddad of saddouk oufella great schollar theoligien of the zaouia tarahmanit which joined this uprising with his tribe. Using his position and influence on Rahmania brotherhood sheikh mohand-aMokrane was able to overcome the dissension in his camp and retake Bordj-Bou-Arreridj.\n\nThe members of the brotherhood Rahamania, disciples of the Sheik Ahaddad(El Haddad) played an eminent part in success of the insurrection of El Mokrani(amokrane), in particular after Sheikh Ahaddad(El Haddad) had proclaimed the war against the French on April 8, 1871. The insurrection acquired a total character through the increase in the number of combatants who rejoined it and his extension to the west, north and the East where considerable stations of the colonial army were encircled in several areas.\n\nAfter having carried several battles Mohand Amokrane(Mohamed El-Mokrani) was martyred on May 5, 1871 at Taouraga. His tomb is located in kollaa n'at-Abbas (Bgayet)(Béjaïa). Under the command of his brother Oumzrag (Boumezreg), the uprising continued until January 20, 1872, date of his arrest and deportation to New Caledonia, an island in the Pacific.\n\nAfter the arrest of Sheik-el-Haddad, the jihad continued under Bouamama. There were also other small insurrectionary movements at Blessed-Menaceur, which forces besieged Cherchel, Zurich, Vesoul-Benian and Hammam-Rirha; this movement was also crushed. From July to September 1872, French forces had still to completely subdued Kabylie. Bou-Mezrag took refuge at Maadid, and later managed to escape the French finding allies among the Tuareg tribes of the South. The general Delacroix, with a small expeditionary force, continued to pursue the rebels until beyond Ouargla. BouMezrag Mokrani, which had remained six days without drinking nor to eat, was finally captured removed.\n\nThe insurrection, which had begun on March 16, 1871 in Medjana was finished on January 20, 1872 by the arrest of Bou-Mezrag. Although a third only of Algeria had taken part in the movement, there had been about 200.000 combatants under the rebel flag.\n\nExile of the brother of El-Mokrani and the whole family to the New Caledonia occurred shortly afterwards. Together with them 212 persons, called Kabyles du Pacifique, who participated in the revolt were tried and deported by French authorities to labor camps on the island of New Caledonia. Mokrani's descendants still live on the island.\n"}

{"id": "18891693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18891693", "title": "Constance Drexel", "text": "Constance Drexel\n\nConstance Drexel (ca. November 24, 1884 or ca. November 28, 1894 (possible; disputed) – August 28, 1956), a naturalized United States citizen, and groundbreaking feature writer for U.S. newspapers, was indicted (but not tried or convicted) for treason in World War II for radio broadcasts from Berlin that extolled Nazi virtues.\n\nShe became famous falsely claiming to be an heiress of the famous Drexel family of Philadelphia. Arrested in Vienna and jailed at war’s end by American troops, she was released and allowed to return to the United States to live. The U.S. Department of Justice eventually dismissed the treason charges against her because her broadcasts were not deemed “political in nature.”\n\nPublic references to Drexel's nation of origin and pedigree were contrary to privately recorded facts. As early as 1915 (in American press reports) and as late as the 1940s (in Nazi broadcasts), she was described as a member of the \"famous Drexel family\" of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, an apparent reference to the descendants of Francis Martin Drexel (who founded the Drexel & Company banking empire), including his son Anthony Joseph Drexel (who founded Drexel University in Philadelphia) and his granddaughter Saint Katharine Drexel.\n\nYet by all accounts, including the one provided by Constance Drexel to the Bureau of Investigation in 1918, she was born in Germany, apparently in the 1880s, many decades after Francis Drexel emigrated from Europe to Philadelphia in 1817. After she began broadcasting from Nazi Germany during wartime, at least one American syndicated columnist speculated that “Drexel” was a pseudonym.\n\nPublished information regarding her age and date of birth is also wildly inconsistent. Historian John Carver Edwards has concluded Drexel was born in Darmstadt, Germany on November 28, 1894, to Theodore Drexel, scion of a wealthy family in Frankfurt, Germany, and Zelda Audemar Drexel, daughter of a prominent Swiss watch manufacturer, and was brought to the United States by her father the following year.\n\nHowever, all five of the ship manifests in Ellis Island records documenting her re-entry into the Port of New York between 1905 and 1923 give an age commensurate with birth in the 1880s.\n\nA U.S. Department of Justice internal memorandum prepared in 1946 described her birth date as November 24, 1884.\n\nDrexel became a United States citizen upon her father’s naturalization in 1899. She reported to the FBI in 1918 that she had a sister named Norma Georgia Drexel, then living in Switzerland. Constance grew up not in Philadelphia, but in Roslindale, Massachusetts, where she attended public schools. \"As an adolescent she divided her time between the United States and Europe, attending school in four different countries and honing her skills as a writer\", completing her education at the Sorbonne in Paris, France.\n\nMiss Drexel first received national publicity in early 1915, when American newspapers began to report that “Philadelphia Heiress” Constance Drexel had volunteered briefly as a Red Cross nurse near the front lines in France in the early months of World War I, and reported on her experiences.\n\nShe became active nationally and internationally in the International Woman's Congress, which met at The Hague in the neutral Netherlands, in April 1915. When she agreed to write dispatches regarding the Congress for American newspapers to publish, her career as a professional journalist began.\n\nShe soon joined the staff of the \"Philadelphia Public Ledger\". When her stories expanded to include not just her experiences but also her opinions, reactions were mixed. In one such article, she wrote \"[one] must realize that an increase in horrors hastens the end of the war; so in the long run it's the most humane thing to have no relief funds or nurses. That's why I left the Red Cross\".\n\nA \"Chicago Herald\" editorial entitled “Horrible Logic” observed that her statement went far to confirm “that, when once moved to cruelty, women are infinitely more cruel than men.” In another column, she opined that \"perhaps the greatest curse of war\" was \"the effect of the loss of men on women and on the race\". She explained that the most \"harrowing sight in all of war-ridden Europe today\" was \"the spectacle of the young girls who must always live unmated, robbed of their birthright\". \"Her writings suggested an enthusiasm for Germany's preparedness campaign, and especially women's role in that effort\", according to Edwards. She became involved in the women's suffrage movement, and, in 1916, as a campaigner for the re-election of Woodrow Wilson.\n\nAfter the United States declared war on the German Empire, she attempted to return to Europe with the announced purpose of visiting her ailing sister in Switzerland, but a complaint from a colleague at the \"Public Ledger\" who alleged she had made pro-German comments led to a federal investigation. Her editors attested to her loyalty, but in part because of her German birth and her pacifism, the investigating agent concluded that she should not be permitted to use her passport.\n\nShe returned to Europe soon after the end of the war, first to cover the Paris Peace Conference and then to cover and participate in the conference of the International Conference of Women and International Woman Suffrage Alliance (which succeeded in obtaining a woman’s equality clause in the Covenant of the League of Nations).\n\nReturning to the United States, she covered the suffrage campaign, and when women won the right to vote, she became one of Capitol Hill's few women political correspondents.\n\nHer readership peaked in the 1920s, when her columns on the status of women around the world, and interviews with world leaders, were published in many newspapers, including not only the \"Public Ledger\" but also the \"Chicago Tribune\", \"The New York Times\", and members of the McClure Syndicate.\n\nBy the early 1930s she achieved a “growing stature among the press corps and certain political circles,” on issues such as international arms control and world peace.\n\nIronically, her interest in those issues did not prevent her from becoming enamored with the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi movement in Germany. \nEdwards concluded that she liked Hitler because she was impressed by his support for other aspects of her “reform agenda,″ including a greater role for women, the eradication of a parasitic social elite, welfare legislation for minors, and social hygiene regulatory laws. \"Drexel eagerly anticipated visits to the new Reich, and on several of these working holidays the Propaganda Ministry awarded her writing assignments.\"\n\nIn 1938, she became employed in Philadelphia in the Works Progress Administration (WPA) Federal Writers' Project and, later, as an instructor of French on the WPA Education Project, when her writing made at least one journalist question whether she had already become a Nazi propagandist.\n\nDrexel returned to Germany in 1939, officially to care for her ailing mother in Wiesbaden, Germany, but travelling at the expense of the German government. In the months leading to Hitler’s invasion of Poland in September 1939, Drexel wrote feature stories for American newspapers that were ostensibly about the home life of ordinary Germans, but that consistently reflected positively on the Nazi regime and negatively on its future adversaries.\n\nFor example, six weeks before the outbreak of war, she wrote in the \"Oakland Tribune\" that the annexation of Austria had prevented the Viennese population from starving; even though this was \"[r]endered more difficult by the United States sudden boycott of manufactured goods from the annexed territories ... now that the peculiar genius of the North Germans for organization and efficient administration is in full play under the new regime, this and other problems with which they are harassed are being overcome.\"\n\nFor a few months after World War II began, she wrote more feature articles about life in Germany that appeared in \"The New York Times\".\n\nBut by that stage of her career, her colleagues in the American press corps had little respect for the quality or integrity of her work. One American network hired her at the beginning of the war, but dropped her almost at once.\n\nShe had constantly pestered Berlin-based CBS radio correspondent William L. Shirer for a job, but as he later explained, he had considered her \"the worst broadcaster I ever heard\".\n\nIn 1940, she began broadcasting on Nazi-controlled shortwave radio channels. She was introduced to listeners as a “world-renowned journalist and a member of the famous Drexel family of Philadelphia.”\n\nAccording to M. Williams Fuller, \"[s]ounding like a grand dame with a stuffy nose, she described Germany as a cornucopia – a land of plenty destined for a glorious future. Her broadcasts concluded with titillating accounts of Germany's art exhibits, concerts, food surplus, haute couture and world-class entertainment.\" Shirer's September 26, 1940 entry in his \"Berlin Diary\" notes that \"the Nazis hire her, as far as I can find out, principally because she's the only woman in town who will sell her American accent to them.\"\n\nWhen applying (through Swiss authorities) for an extension of her U.S. passport in November 1942, she stated that \"[i]n speaking for the German radio, I am following my own ideas; I am not [a] speaker about political or military matters but reporting cultural activities such as activities in the theatre, music and the film.\"\n\nDrexel soon fell from grace among her new colleagues, and top Nazis began avoiding her.\n\nLong after the war, it was reported that she had committed a faux pas while attending a reception for Nazi Party leaders. \"On being introduced to a beautiful young German woman, Drexel blurted: 'oh, you are the girlfriend of Adolf Hitler!'\" \nAs Propaganda Ministry official Inge Doman later testified in the treason trial of Mildred Gillars, known as \"Axis Sally\", Doman warned Gillars \"to keep your distance from that Drexel woman. She's a pest and a crackpot.\"\n\nOn October 1, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a memo to U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle that stated in part, \"There are a number of Americans in Europe who are aiding Hitler et al on the radio. Why should we not proceed to indict them for treason even though we might not be able to try them until after the war?\"\n\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation review of excerpts of such broadcasts stated that Drexel was attempting to show that the war had not lowered the morale of the German people in an effort to discourage the American people from continuing with the war effort. In July 1943, the United States Department of Justice filed treason charges against Drexel and seven other United States citizens who had been broadcasting from Axis-controlled radio stations.\n\nOn August 17, 1945, over three months after the war in Europe had ended, she was arrested in Vienna by American forces after she revealed her identity to a Stars and Stripes reporter on a walk behind the Vienna City Hall.\n\nWearing an American flag lapel pin, she claimed she had always been a loyal citizen, and had only broadcast on cultural questions. At the time of her arrest, her age was listed as 60 (in one newspaper) and almost 70 (in another).\n\nDrexel was detained for over a year before she was transferred to Ellis Island in New York Harbor, pending an October 1946 hearing by a board of inquiry of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, on her eligibility to re-enter the United States. On October 3, 1946, the board decided that she had not forfeited her citizenship, and allowed her to re-enter the country.\n\nAt the time of her release and re-entry, the United States Department of Justice said that her prosecution on the treason charges was no longer contemplated because lawyers who went to Germany to seek further evidence against her failed to uncover any. An internal Department of Justice memorandum dated June 14, 1946, repeats information from the Office of Strategic Services that she \"was stranded in Germany and since she needed money she found a job with the American Propaganda Section of the Reichrundfunk\" but that her twice-weekly broadcasts dealt \"mainly with women, children, and the beauties of the German landscape.\" The memo recommended taking no further action against her.\n\nWalter Winchell and others were still urging prosecution and stiff sentences for the Berlin broadcasters. When the charges were formally dropped on April 14, 1948, the investigators explained that none of Drexel's broadcasts was \"political in nature\".\n\nDrexel died in Waterbury, Connecticut, on August 28, 1956. She collapsed at the home of a cousin before leaving on the first leg of a trip to Geneva, Switzerland, where she intended to move. The obituaries listed her age as 68.\n\n"}

{"id": "234656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234656", "title": "Gangster", "text": "Gangster\n\nA gangster is a criminal who is a member of a gang. Some gangs are considered to be part of organized crime. Gangsters are also called mobsters, a term derived from \"mob\" and the suffix \"-ster\".\nGangs provide a level of organization and resources that support much larger and more complex criminal transactions than an individual criminal could achieve. Gangsters have been active for many years in countries around the world.\n\nSome gangsters, such as Al Capone have become infamous. Gangsters are the subject of many novels and films, particularly from the period between 1920 and 1990.\nSome contemporary criminals refer to themselves as \"gangsta\" in reference to non-rhotic black American pronunciation.\n\nIn today's usage, the term \"gang\" is generally used for a criminal organization, and the term \"gangster\" invariably describes a criminal.\nMuch has been written on the subject of gangs, although there is no clear consensus about what constitutes a gang or what situations lead to gang formation and evolution.\nThere is agreement that the members of a gang have a sense of common identity and belonging, and this is typically reinforced through shared activities and through visual identifications such as special clothing, tattoos or rings. Some preconceptions may be false. For example, the common view that illegal drug distribution in the United States is largely controlled by gangs has been questioned.\n\nA gang may be a relatively small group of people who cooperate in criminal acts, as with the Jesse James gang, which ended with the leader's death in 1882. But a gang may be a larger group with a formal organization that survives the death of its leader. The Chicago Outfit created by Al Capone outlasted its founder's imprisonment and death, and survived into the 21st century. Large and well structured gangs such as the Mafia, drug cartels, Triads or even outlaw motorcycle gangs can undertake complex transactions that would be far beyond the capability of one individual, and can provide services such as dispute arbitration and contract enforcement that parallel those of a legitimate government.\n\nThe term \"organized crime\" is associated with gangs and gangsters, but is not synonymous. A small street gang that engages in sporadic low-level crime would not be seen as \"organized\". An organization that coordinates gangs in different countries involved in the international trade in drugs or prostitutes may not be considered a \"gang\".\n\nAlthough gangs and gangsters have existed in many countries and at many times in the past, they have played more prominent roles during times of weakened social order or when governments have attempted to suppress access to goods or services for which there is a high demand.\n\nThe Sicilian Mafia, or \"Cosa Nostra\" is a criminal syndicate that emerged in the mid-nineteenth century in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share common organizational structure and code of conduct. The origins lie in the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of feudalism in 1812 and its later annexation by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. Primogeniture was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land was to become private property of the peasants.\n\nOrganized crime has existed in Russia since the days of Imperial Russia in the form of banditry and thievery. In the Soviet period \"Vory v Zakone\" emerged, a class of criminals that had to abide by certain rules in the prison system. One such rule was that cooperation with the authorities of any kind was forbidden. During World War II some prisoners made a deal with the government to join the armed forces in return for a reduced sentence, but upon their return to prison they were attacked and killed by inmates who remained loyal to the rules of the thieves. In 1988 the Soviet Union legalized private enterprise but did not provide regulations to ensure the security of market economy. Crude markets emerged, the most notorious being the Rizhsky market where prostitution rings were run next to the Rizhsky Railway Station in Moscow.\n\nAs the Soviet Union headed for collapse many former government workers turned to crime, while others moved overseas. Former KGB agents and veterans of the Afghan and First and Second Chechen Wars, now unemployed but with experience that could prove useful in crime, joined the increasing crime wave. At first, the Vory v Zakone played a key role in arbitrating the gang wars that erupted in the 1990s. By the mid-1990s it was believed that \"Don\" Semion Mogilevich had become the \"boss of all bosses\" of most Russian Mafia syndicates in the world, described by the British government as \"one of the most dangerous men in the world\". More recently, criminals with stronger ties to big business and the government have displaced the Vory from some of their traditional niches, although the Vory are still strong in gambling and the retail trade.\n\nThe Albanian Mafia is active in Albania, the United States, and the European Union (EU) countries, participating in a diverse range of criminal enterprises including drug and arms trafficking. The people of the mountainous country of Albania have always had strong traditions of family and clan loyalty, in some ways similar to that of southern Italy. Ethnic Albanian gangs have grown rapidly since 1992 during the prolonged period of instability in the Balkans after the collapse of Yugoslavia. This coincided with large scale migration throughout Europe and to the United States and Canada. Although based in Albania, the gangs often handle international transactions such as trafficking in economic migrants, drugs and other contraband, and weapons. Other criminal organizations that emerged in the Balkans around this time are popularly called the Serbian Mafia, Bosnian Mafia, Bulgarian Mafia and so on.\n\nIn China, Triads trace their roots to resistance or rebel groups opposed to Manchu rule during the Qing dynasty, which were given the triangle as their emblem.\nThe first record of a triad society, \"Heaven and Earth Gathering\", dates to the Lin Shuangwen uprising on Taiwan from 1786 to 1787.\nThe triads evolved into criminal societies. When the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949 in mainland China, law enforcement became stricter and tough governmental crackdown on criminal organizations forced the triads to migrate to Hong Kong, then a British colony, and other cities around the world.\nTriads today are highly organized, with departments responsible for functions such as accounting, recruiting, communications, training and welfare in addition to the operational arms. They engage in a variety of crimes including extortion, money laundering, smuggling, trafficking and prostitution.\n\nYakuza are members of traditional organized crime syndicates in Japan. They are notorious for their strict codes of conduct and very organized nature. As of 2009 they had an estimated 80,900 members.\nMost modern yakuza derive from two classifications which emerged in the mid-Edo period: tekiya, those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen or shoddy goods; and bakuto, those who were involved in or participated in gambling.\n\nAs American society and culture developed, new immigrants were relocating to the United States. The first major gangs in 19th century New York City were the Irish gangs such as the Whyos and the Dead Rabbits.\nThese were followed by the Italian Five Points Gang and later a Jewish gang known as the Eastman Gang.\nThere were also \"Nativist\" anti-immigration gangs such as the Bowery Boys. The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Mafia that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Sicily. There were similar offshoots in Canada among Italian Canadians.\n\nIn the later 1869s many Chinese emigrated to the United States, escaping from insecurity and economic hardship at home, at first working on the west coast and later moving east.\nThe new immigrants formed Chinese Benevolent Associations.\nIn some cases these evolved into Tongs, or criminal organizations primarily involved in gambling.\nMembers of Triads who migrated to the United States often joined these tongs.\nWith a new wave of migration in the 1960s, street gangs began to flourish in major cities.\nThe tongs recruited these gangs to protect their extortion, gambling and narcotics operations.\n\nThe terms \"gangster\" and \"mobster\" are mostly used in the United States to refer to members of criminal organizations associated with Prohibition or with an American offshoot of the Italian Mafia (such as the Chicago Outfit, the Philadelphia Mafia, or the Five Families).\nIn 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution banned the sale, manufacture, and transportation of alcohol for consumption. Many gangs sold alcohol illegally for tremendous profit, and used acute violence to stake turf and protect their interest. Often, police officers and politicians were paid off or extorted to ensure continued operation.\n\nMost cocaine is grown and processed in South America, particularly in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and smuggled into the United States and Europe, the United States being the world's largest consumer of cocaine.\nColombia is the world's leading producer of cocaine, and also produces heroin that is mostly destined for the US market.\nThe Medellín Cartel was an organized network of drug suppliers and smugglers originating in the city of Medellín, Colombia. The gang operated in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Central America, the United States, as well as Canada and Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It was founded and run by Ochoa Vázquez brothers with Pablo Escobar.\nBy 1993, the Colombian government, helped by the US, had successfully dismantled the cartel by imprisoning or hunting and gunning down its members.\n\nAlthough Mexican drug cartels, or drug trafficking organizations, have existed for several decades, they have become more powerful since the demise of Colombia's Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale illicit drug market in the United States.\nSixty five percent of cocaine enters the United States through Mexico, and the vast majority of the rest enters through Florida. Cocaine shipments from South America transported through Mexico or Central America are generally moved over land or by air to staging sites in northern Mexico. The cocaine is then broken down into smaller loads for smuggling across the U.S.–Mexico border.\nArrests of key gang leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as gangs fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.\n\nCocaine traffickers from Colombia, and recently Mexico, have also established a labyrinth of smuggling routes throughout the Caribbean, the Bahama Island chain, and South Florida. They often hire traffickers from Mexico or the Dominican Republic to transport the drug. The traffickers use a variety of smuggling techniques to transfer their drug to U.S. markets. These include airdrops of 500–700 kg in the Bahama Islands or off the coast of Puerto Rico, mid-ocean boat-to-boat transfers of 500–2,000 kg, and the commercial shipment of tonnes of cocaine through the port of Miami.\nAnother route of cocaine traffic goes through Chile, this route is primarily used for cocaine produced in Bolivia since the nearest seaports lie in northern Chile. The arid Bolivia-Chile border is easily crossed by 4x4 vehicles that then head to the seaports of Iquique and Antofagasta.\n\nAl Capone was one of the most influential gangsters during the period. Born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in 1899 to immigrant parents, Capone was recruited by members of the Five Points Gang in the early 1920s. Capone’s childhood friend, Lucky Luciano, was also originally a member of the Five Points Gang. Capone would rise to control a major portion of illicit activity such as gambling, prostitution, and bootlegging in Chicago during the early twentieth century.\n\nFrank Costello was another influential gangster. He was born in southern Italy but moved to America when he was four years old. He later changed his name from Francesco Castiglia to Frank Costello when he joined a gang at age 13. His name change led some people to mistakenly believe he was Irish. He worked with Charlie Luciano in bootlegging and gambling. He also had a lot of political power which enabled him to continue his business. He took charge when Luciano was arrested and expanded the gang's operations. He decided to step away from the gangster life and died peacefully in 1973.\n\nCarlo Gambino was an influential gangster in America. From 1961 until he died in 1976, he was chairman of the Italian-American Mafia.\nGambino was born in Palermo, Sicily, but moved to the United States at the age of 21. Through his Castellano relatives, he joined the Masseria Family. While Lucky Luciano was the underboss in the Masseria Family, Gambino worked for him. After Luciano had Masseria killed, Luciano became the boss, and Gambino was sent to the Scalise Family. Later Scalise was stripped of his rank, and Vincenzo Mangano became boss until 1951, when Mangano disappeared. His body was never found.\n\nThe Kray twins, Reginald and Ronald Kray, were leading criminals in London, England in the 1950s and 1960s. They were involved in armed robberies, arson, protection rackets, violent assaults including torture and the murders of Jack \"The Hat\" McVitie and George Cornell. As West End nightclub owners, they mixed with prominent entertainers including Diana Dors, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and politicians. The Krays were highly feared within their social environment.\nIn the 1960s they became celebrities in their own right, being photographed by David Bailey and interviewed on television. They were arrested in 1968 and both sentenced to life imprisonment.\nLucky Luciano (born Salvatore Lucania), a Sicilian gangster, is considered to be the father of modern organized crime and the mastermind of the massive postwar expansion of the international heroin trade. He was the first official boss of the modern Genovese crime family and is credited with organizing the American Mafia's ruling body.\n\nBorn in southern Italy in 1882, Torrio immigrated to the United States with his mother after his father's death, which happened when he was three years old. Known as \"The Fox\" for his cunning, he helped the formation of the Chicago Outfit and he is credited for inspiring the birth of the National Crime Syndicate. He was a big influence on Al Capone, who regarded him as a mentor. After the assassination of Big Jim Colosimo, Torrio took his place in the Chicago Outfit. He was severely wounded by members of the North Side Gang while returning from a shopping trip, forcing him, along with other problems, to quit the criminal activity. He died in 1957 and the media learned about his death three weeks after his burial. Elmer Irey, official of the United States Treasury Department, defined Torrio \"the biggest gangster in America\", \"the smartest and the best of all the hoodlums\" while Virgil W. Peterson of the Chicago Crime Commission considered him \"an organizational genius\".\n\nGangs have long been the subject of movies. In fact, the first feature-length movie ever produced was \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" (1906), an Australian production that traced the life of the outlaw Ned Kelly (1855–1880). The United States has profoundly influenced the genre, but other cultures have contributed distinctive and often excellent gangster movies.\n\nThe classic gangster movie ranks with the Western as one of the most successful creations of the American movie industry. The \"classic\" form of gangster movie, rarely produced in recent years, tells of a gangster working his way up through his enterprise and daring, until his organization collapses while he is at the peak of his powers. Although the ending is presented as a moral outcome, it is usually seen as no more than an accidental failure. The gangster is typically articulate, although at times lonely and depressed, and his worldly wisdom and defiance of social norms has a strong appeal, particularly to adolescents.\nThe stereotypical image and myth of the American gangster is closely associated with organized crime during the Prohibition era of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe years 1931 and 1932 saw the genre produce three classics: Warner Bros.' \"Little Caesar\" and \"The Public Enemy\", which made screen icons out of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney, and Howard Hughs' \"Scarface\" starring Paul Muni, which offered a dark psychological analysis of a fictionalized Al Capone. These films chronicle the quick rise, and equally quick downfall, of three young, violent criminals, and represent the genre in its purest form before moral pressure would force it to change and evolve. Though the gangster in each film would face a violent downfall which was designed to remind the viewers of the consequences of crime, audiences were often able to identify with the charismatic anti-hero. Those suffering from the Depression were able to relate to the gangster character who worked hard to earn his place and success in the world, only to have it all taken away from him.\n\nLatin American gangster movies are known for their gritty realism. \"Soy un delincuente\" (English: I Am a Criminal) is a 1976 Venezuelan film by director Clemente de la Cerda. The film tells the story of Ramón Antonio Brizuela, a real-life individual, who since childhood has to deal with rampant violence and the drugs, sex and petty thievery of a Caracas slum. Starting with delinquency, Ramón moves on to serious gang activity and robberies. He grows into a tough, self-confident young man who is hardened to violence. His views change when his fiancée's brother is killed in a robbery. The film was a blockbuster hit in Venezuela.\n\n\"City of God\" () is a 2002 Brazilian crime drama film directed by Fernando Meirelles and co-directed by Kátia Lund, released in its home country in 2002 and worldwide in 2003. All the characters existed in reality, and the story is based on real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the '60s and the beginning of the '80s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Li'l Zé and criminal Knockout Ned. The film received four Academy Award nominations in 2004.\n\nThe first yakuza (gangster) film made in Japan was \"Bakuto\" (Gambler, 1964). The genre soon became popular, and by the 1970s the Japanese film industry was turning out a hundred mostly low-budget yakuza films each year. The films are descendants of the samurai epics, and are closer to Westerns than to Hollywood gangster movies. The hero is typically torn between compassion for the oppressed and his sense of duty to the gang. The plots are generally highly stylized, starting with the protagonist being released from prison and ending in a gory sword fight in which he dies an honorable death.\n\nAlthough some Hong Kong gangster movies are simply vehicles for violent action, the mainstream movies in the genre deal with Triad societies portrayed as quasi-benign organizations. The movie gangster applies the Taoist principles of balance and honor to his conduct. The plots are often similar to those of Hollywood gangster movies, often ending with the fall of the subject of the movie at the hands of another gangster, but such a fall is far less important than a fall from honor. The first movie made by the acclaimed director Wong Kar-wai was a gangster movie, \"As Tears Go By\". In it the protagonist finds himself torn between his desire for a woman and his loyalty to a fellow gangster. \"Infernal Affairs\" (2002) is a thriller about a police officer who infiltrates a triad and a triad member who infiltrates the police department. The film was remade by Martin Scorsese as \"The Departed\".\n\nGangster films make up one of the most profitable segments of the South Korean film industry. Films made in the 1960s were often influenced by Japanese yakuza films, dealing with internal conflict between members of a gang or external conflict with other gangs. The gangsters' code of conduct and loyalty are important elements. Starting in the 1970s, strict censorship caused decline in the number and quality of gangster movies, and none were made in the 1980s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a surge of imports of action movies from Hong Kong. The first of the new wave of important home grown gangster movies was Im Kwon-taek's \"General's Son\" (1990). Although this movie followed the earlier tradition, it was followed by a series of sophisticated gangster noirs set in contemporary urban locations, such as \"A Bittersweet Life\" (2005).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1742970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1742970", "title": "Genealogy of Jesus", "text": "Genealogy of Jesus\n\nThe New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke. Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph's father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli.\n\nTraditional Christian scholars (starting with the historian Eusebius) have put forward various theories that seek to explain why the lineages are so different, such as that Matthew's account follows the lineage of Joseph, while Luke's follows the lineage of Mary. Some modern critical scholars like Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan claim both genealogies as inventions, to bring the Messianic claims into conformity with Jewish criteria.\n\nMatthew 1:1–17 begins the Gospel, \"A record of the origin of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac…\" and continues on until \"…and Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.\"\n\nMatthew emphasizes, right from the beginning, Jesus' title \"Christ\"—the Greek rendering of the Hebrew title \"Messiah\"—meaning \"anointed\", in the sense of an anointed king. Jesus is presented as the long-awaited Messiah, who was expected to be a descendant of King David. Matthew begins by calling Jesus \"the son of David\", indicating his royal origin, and also \"son of Abraham\", indicating that he was an Israelite; both are stock phrases, in which \"son\" means \"descendant\", calling to mind the promises God made to David and to Abraham.\n\nMatthew's introductory title (, \"book of generations\") has been interpreted in various ways, but most likely is simply a title for the genealogy that follows, echoing the Septuagint use of the same phrase for genealogies.\n\nMatthew's genealogy is considerably more complex than Luke's. It is overtly schematic, organized into three tesseradecads (sets of fourteen), each of a distinct character:\n\nThe total of 42 generations is achieved only by omitting several names, so the choice of three sets of fourteen seems deliberate. Various explanations have been suggested: fourteen is twice seven, symbolizing perfection and covenant, and is also the gematria (numerical value) of the name \"David\".\n\nThe rendering into Greek of Hebrew names in this genealogy is mostly in accord with the Septuagint, but there are a few peculiarities. The form \"Asaph\" seems to identify King Asa with the psalmist Asaph. Likewise, some see the form \"Amos\" for King Amon as suggesting the prophet Amos, though the Septuagint does have this form. Both may simply be assimilations to more familiar names. More interesting, though, are the unique forms \"Boes\" (Boaz, LXX \"Boos\") and \"Rachab\" (Rahab, LXX \"Raab\").\n\nThree consecutive kings of Judah are omitted: Ahaziah, Jehoash, and Amaziah. These three kings are seen as especially wicked, from the cursed line of Ahab through his daughter Athaliah to the third and fourth generation. The author could have omitted them to create a second set of fourteen.\n\nAnother omitted king is Jehoiakim, the father of Jeconiah, also known as Jehoiachin. In Greek the names are even more similar, both being sometimes called \"Joachim\". When Matthew says, \"Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile,\" he appears to conflate the two, because Jehoiakim, not Jeconiah, had brothers, but the exile was in the time of Jeconiah. While some see this as a mistake, others argue that the omission was once again deliberate, ensuring that the kings after David spanned exactly fourteen generations.\n\nThe final group also contains fourteen generations. If Josiah's son was intended as Jehoiakim, then Jeconiah could be counted separately after the exile. Mary is counted as a generation, proceeding from her father, Joseph. Though such a reckoning is otherwise little known or understood, it fits with the fourteen generations. Otherwise, it confuses the father of Mary with the husband of Mary. Some have even proposed that Matthew's original text had one Joseph as the of Mary, who then married another man of the same name.\n\nFourteen generations span the time from Jeconiah, born about 616 BC, to Jesus, born circa 3 BC. The average generation gap would be around forty-four years. However, in the Old Testament, there are even wider gaps between generations. Also, we do not see any instances of papponymic naming patterns, where children are named after their grandparents, which was a common custom throughout this period. This may indicate that Matthew has telescoped this segment by collapsing such repetitions.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke, the genealogy appears at the beginning of the public life of Jesus. This version is in ascending order from Joseph to Adam. After telling of the baptism of Jesus, states, \"Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was \"[the son]\" of Heli, ...\" (3:23) and continues on until \"Adam, which was \"[the son]\" of God.\" (3:38) The Greek text of Luke's Gospel does not use the word \"son\" in the genealogy after \"son of Joseph\". Robertson notes that, in the Greek, \"Luke has the article \"tou\" repeating \"uiou\" (Son) except before Joseph\".\n\nThis genealogy descends from the Davidic line through Nathan, who is an otherwise little-known son of David, mentioned briefly in the Old Testament.\n\nIn the ancestry of David, Luke agrees completely with the Old Testament. Cainan is included between Shelah and Arphaxad, following the Septuagint text (though not included in the Masoretic text followed by most modern Bibles).\n\nAugustine notes that the count of generations in the Book of Luke is 77, a number symbolizing the forgiveness of all sins. This count also agrees with the seventy generations from Enoch set forth in the Book of Enoch, which Luke probably knew. Though Luke never counts the generations as Matthew does, it appears he also followed hebdomadic principle of working in sevens. However, Irenaeus counts only 72 generations from Adam.\n\nThe reading \"son of Aminadab, son of Aram,\" from the Old Testament is well attested. The Nestle-Aland critical edition, considered the best authority by most modern scholars, accepts the variant \"son of Aminadab, son of Admin, son of Arni,\" counting the 76 generations from Adam rather than God.\n\nLuke's qualification \"as was supposed\" () avoids stating that Jesus was actually a son of Joseph, since his virgin birth is affirmed in the same gospel. From as early as John of Damascus, the view of \"as was supposed of Joseph\" regards Luke as calling Jesus a son of Eli—meaning that Heli (, Heli) was the maternal grandfather of Jesus, with Luke tracing the ancestry of Jesus through Mary. Therefore per Adam Clarke (1817), John Wesley, John Kitto and others the expression \"Joseph, [ ] of Heli\", without the word \"son\" being present in the Greek, indicates that \"Joseph, of Heli\" is to be read \"Joseph, [son-in-law] of Heli\". There are, however, other interpretations of how this qualification relates to the rest of the genealogy. Some see the remainder as the true genealogy of Joseph, despite the different genealogy given in Matthew.\n\nThe following table is a side-by-side comparison of Matthew's and Luke's genealogies. Converging sections are shown with a green background, and diverging sections are shown with a red background.\n\nThe holy fathers of the Orthodox Church state that both accounts are true. In his famous book \"An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith\", St John Damascene says the following.\"One ought also to observe this, that the law was that when a man died without seed, this man's brother should take to wife the wife of the dead man and raise up seed to his brother. The offspring, therefore, belonged by nature to the second, that is, to him that begat it, but by law to the dead. Born then of the line of Nathan, the son of David, Levi begat Melchi and Panther: Panther begat Barpanther, so called. This Barpanther begat Joachim: Joachim begat the holy Mother of God. And of the line of Solomon, the son of David, Mathan had a wife of whom he begat Jacob. Now on the death of Mathan, Melchi, of the tribe of Nathan, the son of Levi and brother of Panther, married the wife of Mathan, Jacob's mother, of whom he begat Heli. Therefore Jacob and Heli became brothers on tile mother's side, Jacob being of the tribe of Solomon and Heli of the tribe of Nathan. Then Heli of the tribe of Nathan died childless, and Jacob his brother, of the tribe of Solomon, took his wife and raised up seed to his brother and begat Joseph. Joseph, therefore, is by nature the son of Jacob, of the line of Solomon, but by law he is the son of Heli of the line of Nathan.\"\n\nModern scholarship tends to see the genealogies of Jesus as theological constructs rather than factual history: family pedigrees would not usually have been available for non-priestly families, and the contradictions between the two lists are seen as clear evidence that these were not based on genealogical records. Additionally, the use of titles such as 'Son of God' and 'Son of David' are seen as evidence that they do not come from the earliest Gospel traditions. Raymond E. Brown says the genealogies \"tell us nothing certain about his grandparents or his great-grand-parents\".\n\nGundry suggests the series of unknown names in Matthew connecting Joseph's grandfather to Zerubbabel as an outright fabrication, produced by collecting and then modifying various names from 1 Chronicles. Sivertsen sees Luke's as artificially pieced together out of oral traditions. The pre-exilic series \"Levi, Simeon, Judah, Joseph\" consists of the names of tribal patriarchs, far more common after the exile than before, while the name \"Mattathias\" and its variants begin at least three suspiciously similar segments. Kuhn likewise suggests that the two series \"Jesus–Mattathias\" (77–63) and \"Jesus–Mattatha\" (49–37) are duplicates.\n\nThe contradictions between the lists have been used to question the accuracy of the gospel accounts since ancient times, and several early Christian authors responded to this. Augustine, for example, attempted on several occasions to refute every criticism, not only because the Manichaeans in his day were using the differences to attack Christianity, but also because he himself had seen them in his youth as cause for doubting the veracity of the Gospels. His explanation for the different names given for Joseph's father is that Joseph had a biological father and an adoptive father, and that one of the gospels traces the genealogy through the adoptive father in order to draw parallels between Joseph and Jesus (both having an adoptive father) and as a metaphor for God's relationship with humankind, in the sense that God \"adopted\" human beings as his children.\n\nOne common explanation for the divergence is that Matthew is recording the actual legal genealogy of Jesus through Joseph, according to Jewish custom, whereas Luke, writing for a Gentile audience, gives the actual biological genealogy of Jesus through Mary. This argument is problematic, however, because both trace their genealogy through Joseph. Eusebius of Caesarea, on the other hand, affirmed the interpretation of Africanus that Luke's genealogy is of Joseph (not of Mary), who was the natural son of Jacob, though legally of Eli who was the uterine brother of Jacob.\n\nThe earliest tradition that explains the divergence of Joseph's lineages involves the law of levirate marriage. A woman whose husband died without issue was bound by law to be married to her husband's brother, and the first-born son of such a so-called levirate marriage was reckoned and registered as the son of the deceased brother (Deuteronomy 25:5 sqq.). Sextus Julius Africanus, in his 3rd-century \"Epistle to Aristides\", reports a tradition that Joseph was born from just such a levirate marriage. According to this report, Joseph's natural father was Jacob son of Matthan, as given in Matthew, while his legal father was Eli son of Melchi (\"sic\"), as given in Luke.\n\nIt has been questioned, however, whether levirate marriages actually occurred among uterine brothers; they are expressly excluded in the Halakhah Beth Hillel but permitted by Shammai. According to Jesuit theologian Anthony Maas, the question proposed to Jesus by the Sadducees in all three Synoptic Gospels regarding a woman with seven levirate husbands suggests that this law was observed at the time of Christ.\n\nJulius Africanus, explaining the origin of Joseph from levirate marriage, makes a mistake:\n\nThis error, however, is uncritical:\n\nA more straightforward and the most common explanation is that Luke's genealogy is of Mary, with Eli being her father, while Matthew's describes the genealogy of Joseph. This view was advanced as early as John of Damascus (d.749).\n\nLuke's text says that Jesus was \"a son, as was supposed, of Joseph, of Eli\". The qualification has traditionally been understood as acknowledgment of the virgin birth, but some instead see a parenthetical expression: \"a son (as was supposed of Joseph) of Eli.\" In this interpretation, Jesus is called a son of Eli because Eli was his maternal grandfather, his nearest male ancestor. A variation on this idea is to explain \"Joseph son of Eli\" as meaning a son-in-law, perhaps even an adoptive heir to Eli through his only daughter Mary. An example of the Old Testament use of such an expression is Jair, who is called \"Jair son of Manasseh\" but was actually son of Manasseh's granddaughter. In any case, the argument goes, it is natural for the evangelist, acknowledging the unique case of the virgin birth, to give the maternal genealogy of Jesus, while expressing it a bit awkwardly in the traditional patrilinear style.\n\nAccording to R. A. Torrey, the reason Mary is not implicitly mentioned by name is because the ancient Hebrews never permitted the name of a woman to enter the genealogical tables, but inserted her husband as the son of him who was, in reality, but his father-in-law.\n\nLightfoot sees confirmation in an obscure passage of the Talmud, which, as he reads it, refers to \"Mary daughter of Eli\"; however, both the identity of this Mary and the reading are doubtful. Patristic tradition, on the contrary, consistently identifies Mary's father as Joachim. It has been suggested that \"Eli\" is short for \"Eliakim\", which in the Old Testament is an alternate name of Jehoiakim, for whom Joachim is named.\n\nThe theory neatly accounts for the genealogical divergence. It is consistent with the early tradition ascribing a Davidic ancestry to Mary. It is also consistent with Luke's intimate acquaintance with Mary, in contrast to Matthew's focus on Joseph's perspective. On the other hand, there is no explicit indication whatsoever, either in the Gospel or in any early tradition, that the genealogy is Mary's.\n\nAfter John of Damascus the claim that Luke gives Mary's genealogy is mentioned in a single extant Western medieval text, in which pseudo-Hilary cites it as an opinion held by many, though not himself. This claim was revived by Annius of Viterbo in 1498 and quickly grew in popularity.\n\nModern scholars discount this approach: Raymond E. Brown called it a \"pious deduction\"; and Joachim Gnilka \"the desperation of embarrassment\".\n\nJewish law is relevant to these matters. It does not accept maternal ancestry as applying to lineage claims, which go through the father alone. See on this the discussion in the section \"Legal inheritance,\" below, and the footnote reference provided on this subject there.\n\nA minority view holds that while Luke gives the genealogy of Joseph, Matthew gives the genealogy of Mary. A few ancient authorities seem to offer this interpretation. Although the Greek text as it stands is plainly against it, it has been proposed that in the original text Matthew had one Joseph as Mary's father and another as her husband. This neatly explains not only why Matthew's genealogy differs from Luke's, but also why Matthew counts fourteen generations rather than thirteen. Blair sees the various extant versions as the predictable result of copyists repeatedly attempting to correct an apparent mistake. Others argue that here the Aramaic original of Matthew used the word \"gowra\" (which could mean \"father\"), which, in the absence of vowel markings, was read by the Greek translator as \"gura\" (\"husband\"). In any case, an early understanding that Matthew traced Mary's genealogy would explain why the contradiction between Matthew and Luke apparently escaped notice until the 3rd century. This position is also clearly stated in \"Jesus Christ Our Promised Seed\".\n\nA Jewish tradition relating Mary to Luke's genealogy is recorded in the \"Doctrina Jacobi\" (written in 634), in which a Tiberian rabbi mocks the Christian veneration of Mary by recounting her genealogy according to the tradition of the Jews of Tiberias. A century later, John of Damascus and others report the same information, only inserting an extra generation, \"Barpanther\" (Aramaic for \"son of Panther\", thus indicating a misunderstood Aramaic source). A certain prince Andronicus later found the same polemic in a book belonging to a rabbi named Elijah:\nWhy do Christians extol Mary so highly, calling her nobler than the Cherubim, incomparably greater than the Seraphim, raised above the heavens, purer than the very rays of the sun? For she was a woman, of the race of David, born to Anne her mother and Joachim her father, who was son of Panther. Panther and Melchi were brothers, sons of Levi, of the stock of Nathan, whose father was David of the tribe of Judah.\nAlthough most accounts ascribing the Luke genealogy to Mary's line do not include a levirate marriage this is added by the above sources. Each of these texts then goes on to describe, just as in Julius Africanus (but omitting the name of Estha), how Melchi was related to Joseph through a levirate marriage.\n\nBede assumed that Julius Africanus was mistaken and corrected \"Melchi\" to \"Matthat\". Since papponymics were common in this period, however, it would not be surprising if Matthat were also named Melchi after his grandfather.\n\nControversy has surrounded the name \"Panther\", mentioned above, because of a charge that Jesus' father was a soldier named Pantera. Celsus mentions this in his writing, \"The True Word\", where he is quoted by Origen in Book 1: 32. \"But let us now return to where the Jew is introduced, speaking of the mother of Jesus, and saying that \"when she was pregnant she was turned out of doors by the carpenter to whom she had been betrothed, as having been guilty of adultery, and that she bore a child to a certain soldier named Panthera.\" Epiphanius, in refutation of Celsus, writes that Joseph and Cleopas were sons of \"Jacob, surnamed Panther.\"\n\nTwo Talmudic-era texts referring to Jesus as the son of Pantera (Pandera) are Tosefta Hullin 2:22f: \"Jacob ... came to heal him in the name of Jesus son of Pantera\" and Qohelet Rabbah 1:8(3): \"Jacob ... came to heal him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera\" and some editions of the Jerusalem Talmud also specifically name Jesus as the son of Pandera: Jerusalem Abodah Zarah 2:2/7: \"someone ... whispered to him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera\"; Jerusalem Shabboth 14:4/8: \"someone ... whispered to him in the name of Jesus son of Pandera\"; Jerusalem Abodah Zarah 2:2/12: \"Jacob ... came to heal him. He said to him: we will speak to you in the name of Jesus son of Pandera\"; Jerusalem Shabboth 14:4/13: \"Jacob ... came in the name of Jesus Pandera to heal him\". Because some editions of the Jerusalem Talmud do not contain the name Jesus in these passages the association is disputed.\n\nOne of the traditional explanations is that Matthew traces not a genealogy in the modern biological sense, but a record of legal inheritance showing the succession of Jesus in the royal line.\n\nAccording to this theory, Matthew's immediate goal is therefore not David, but Jeconiah, and in his final group of fourteen, he may freely jump to a maternal grandfather, skip generations, or perhaps even follow an adoptive lineage in order to get there. Attempts have been made to reconstruct Matthew's route, from the seminal work of Lord Hervey to Masson's recent work, but all are necessarily highly speculative.\n\nAs a starting point, one of Joseph's two fathers could be by simple adoption, as Augustine suggests, or more likely the special adoption by a father-in-law with no sons, or could be a maternal grandfather. On the other hand, the resemblance between \"Matthan\" and \"Matthat\" suggests they are the same man (in which case Jacob and Eli are either identical or full brothers involved in a levirate marriage), and Matthew's departure from Luke at that point can only be to follow legal line of inheritance, perhaps through a maternal grandfather. Such reasoning could further explain what has happened with Zerubbabel and Shealtiel. A key difficulty with these explanations, however, is that there is no adoption in Jewish law, which of course is the relevant law tradition even according to Jesus (Matt. 23:1-3), not the Roman law tradition. If Joseph is not the biological father, his lineage does not apply to Jesus, and there is no provision available within Jewish law for this to be altered. One's natural father is always one's father. Nor is inheritance of lineage claims even possible through one's mother, in Jewish law.\n\nThe apocryphal \"Protevangelium of James\" tells of the miraculous birth of Mary to her parents, Joachim and Anne. It further relates that Joseph, before his marriage to Mary, was an elderly widower with children of his own. Joachim and Anne are named in a number of other early sources as Mary's parents, but this apocryphal text, which was not incorporated into the biblical canon, was so widely influential that it is not clear whether the names rest on any other independent tradition.\n\nThe genealogies in Luke and Matthew appear to briefly converge at Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, though they differ both above Shealtiel and below Zerubbabel. This is also the point where Matthew departs from the Old Testament record.\n\nIn the Old Testament, Zerubbabel was a hero who led the Jews back from Babylon about 520 BC, governed Judah, and rebuilt the temple. Several times he is called a son of Shealtiel. He appears once in the genealogies in the \"Book of Chronicles\", where his descendants are traced for several generations, but the passage has a number of difficulties. While the Septuagint text here gives his father as Shealtiel, the Masoretic text instead substitutes Shealtiel's brother Pedaiah—both sons of King Jeconiah, according to the passage. Some, accepting the Masoretic reading, suppose that Pedaiah begot a son for Shealtiel through a levirate marriage, but most scholars now accept the Septuagint reading as original, in agreement with Matthew and all other accounts.\n\nThe appearance of Zerubbabel and Shealtiel in Luke may be no more than a coincidence of names (\"Zerubbabel\", at least, is a very common Babylonian name). Shealtiel is given a completely different ancestry, and Zerubbabel a different son. Furthermore, interpolation between known dates would put the birth of Luke's Shealtiel at the very time when the celebrated Zerubbabel led the Jews back from Babylon. Thus, it is likely that Luke's Shealtiel and Zerubbabel were distinct from, and perhaps even named after, Matthew's.\n\nIf they are the same, as many insist, then the question arises of how Shealtiel, like Joseph, could have two fathers. Yet another complex levirate marriage has often been invoked. Richard Bauckham, however, argues for the authenticity of Luke alone. In this view, the genealogy in \"Chronicles\" is a late addition grafting Zerubbabel onto the lineage of his predecessors, and Matthew has simply followed the royal succession. In fact, Bauckham says, Zerubbabel's legitimacy hinged on descending from David through Nathan rather than through the prophetically cursed ruling line.\n\nThe name \"Rhesa\", given in Luke as the son of Zerubbabel, is usually seen as the Aramaic word \"rēʾšāʾ\", meaning \"head\" or \"prince\". It might well befit a son of Zerubbabel, but some see the name as a misplaced title of Zerubbabel himself. If so, the next generation in Luke, Joanan, might be Hananiah in \"Chronicles\". Subsequent names in Luke, as well as Matthew's next name Abiud, cannot be identified in \"Chronicles\" on more than a speculative basis.\n\nBy the time of Jesus, it was already commonly understood that several prophecies in the Old Testament promised a Messiah descended from King David. Thus, in tracing the Davidic ancestry of Jesus, the Gospels aim to show that these messianic prophecies are fulfilled in him.\n\nThe prophecy of Nathan—understood as foretelling a son of God who would inherit the throne of his ancestor David and reign forever—is quoted in Hebrews and strongly alluded to in Luke's account of the Annunciation. Likewise, the Psalms record God's promise to establish the seed of David on his throne forever, while Isaiah and Jeremiah speak of the coming reign of a righteous king of the house of David.\n\nDavid's ancestors are also understood as progenitors of the Messiah in several prophecies. Isaiah's description of the branch or root of Jesse is cited twice by Paul as a promise of the Christ.\n\nMore controversial are the prophecies on the Messiah's relation, or lack thereof, to certain of David's descendants:\n\nThe promise to Solomon and Jeconiah's curse, if applicable, argue against Matthew. Yet evidently Matthew didn't find his respective genealogy incompatible with these prophecies.\n\nMatthew also presents the virgin birth of Jesus as fulfillment of , which he quotes. Matthew apparently quotes the ancient Septuagint translation of the verse, which for an unclear reason, renders the Hebrew word \"almah\"(young woman) as \"virgin\" in Greek.\n\n\"Desposyni\" (Greek δεσπόσυνοι, \"desposynoi\", \"those of the master\") is a term used uniquely by Sextus Julius Africanus to refer to the relatives of Jesus. The Gospels mention four brothers of Jesus—James, Joses, Simon, and Jude—and unnamed sisters.\n\nEpiphanius of Salamis relates that the four brothers and the unnamed sisters that he names as Mary and Salome (or Anna and Salome) were children of Joseph by a previous marriage. These and their descendants were prominent in the early Church down to the 2nd century. Muslim authors extend family members to the 7th century.\n\nSince ancient times, it has been debated precisely how these siblings were related to Jesus, or rather to Joseph and Mary, with her perpetual virginity at issue. There are three principal views on who these siblings were, named for their respective proponents:\n\nThere is no suggestion in ancient sources that Jesus himself had any physical children, but a claim has been popularized in recent decades that a bloodline of Jesus, through Mary Magdalene, has survived and subsequently recorded in the book \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\".\n\nMatthew inserts four women into the long list of men. The women are included early in the genealogy—Tamar, Rachab, Ruth, and \"the wife of Uriah\" (Bathsheba). Why Matthew chose to include these particular women, while passing over others such as the matriarchs Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, has been much discussed.\n\nThere may be a common thread among these four women, to which Matthew wishes to draw attention. He sees God working through Tamar's seduction of her father-in-law, through the collusion of Rahab the harlot with Joshua's spies, through Ruth the Moabite's unexpected marriage with Boaz, and through David and Bathsheba's adultery.\n\nSome have suggested their possible Gentile origins. Rahab was a prostitute in Canaan, Bathsheba was married to a Hittite, Ruth resided in Moab, and Tamar had a name of Hebrew origin. The women's nationalities are not necessarily mentioned. The suggestion is that Matthew may be preparing the reader for the inclusion of the Gentiles in Christ's mission. Others point out an apparent element of sinfulness: Rahab was a prostitute, Tamar posed as a prostitute to seduce Judah, Bathsheba was an adulteress, and Ruth is sometimes seen as seducing Boaz—thus Matthew emphasizes God's grace in response to sin. Still others point out their unusual, even scandalous, unions—preparing the reader for what will be said about Mary. None of these explanations, however, adequately befits all four women.\n\nNolland suggests simply that these were all the known women attached to David's genealogy in the Book of Ruth.\n\nThe conclusion of the genealogy proper is also unusual: having traced the ancestry of Joseph, Matthew identifies him not as the father of Jesus, but as the husband of Mary. The Greek text is explicit in making Jesus born to Mary, rather than to Joseph. This careful wording is to affirm the virgin birth, which Matthew proceeds to discuss, stating that Jesus was begotten not by Joseph but by God.\n\nLuke states that Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, was a \"relative\" (Greek syggenēs, συγγενής) of Mary, and that Elizabeth was descended from Aaron, of the tribe of Levi. Whether she was an aunt, a cousin, or a more distant relation cannot be determined from the word. Some, such as Gregory Nazianzen, have inferred from this that Mary herself was also a Levite descended from Aaron, and thus kingly and priestly lineages were united in Jesus. Others, such as Thomas Aquinas, have argued that the relationship was on the maternal side; that Mary's father was from Judah, Mary's mother from Levi. Modern scholars like Raymond Brown (1973) and Géza Vermes (2005) suggest that the relationship between Mary and Elizabeth is simply an invention of Luke.\n\nThese two Gospels declare that Jesus was begotten not by Joseph, but by the power of the Holy Spirit while Mary was still a virgin, in fulfillment of prophecy. Thus, in mainstream Christianity, Jesus is regarded as being literally the \"only begotten son\" of God, while Joseph is regarded as his adoptive father.\n\nMatthew immediately follows the genealogy of Jesus with: \"This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit\".\n\nLikewise, Luke tells of the Annunciation: \"How will this be,\" Mary asked the angel, \"since I am a virgin?\" The angel answered, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.\"\n\nThe question then arises, why do both gospels seem to trace the genealogy of Jesus through Joseph, when they deny that he is his biological father? Augustine considers it a sufficient answer that Joseph was the father of Jesus by adoption, his legal father, through whom he could rightfully claim descent from David.\n\nTertullian, on the other hand, argues that Jesus must have descended from David by blood through his mother Mary. He sees Biblical support in Paul's statement that Jesus was \"born of a descendant of David according to the flesh\". Affirmations of Mary's Davidic ancestry are found early and often.\n\nThe Ebionites, a sect who denied the virgin birth, used a gospel which, according to Epiphanius, was a recension of Matthew that omitted the genealogy and infancy narrative. These differences reflect the Ebionites' awareness of Jewish law (halakhah) relating to lineage inheritance, adoption, and the status of ancestry claims through the mother.\n\nThe Qurʼan upholds the virgin birth of Jesus (ʻĪsā) and thus considers his genealogy only through Mary (Maryam), without mentioning Joseph.\n\nMary is very highly regarded in the Qurʼan, the nineteenth sura being named for her. She is called a daughter of ʻImrān, whose family is the subject of the third sura. The same Mary (Maryam) is also called a sister of Aaron (Hārūn) in one place, and although this is often seen as an anachronistic conflation with the Old Testament Miriam (having the same name), who was sister to Aaron (Hārūn) and daughter to Amram (ʻImrān), the phrase is probably not to be understood literally.\n\nAccording to Muslim Scholar Sheikh Ibn Al-Feasy Al-Hanbali, the Quran used \"Sister of Aaron\" and \"Daughter of Amram\" for several reasons. One of those is the \"relative calling\" or \"laqb\" that is always used in Arabic literature. Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal Abu `Abd Allah al-Shaybani, for instance, is prevalently called \"Ibn Hanbal\" instead of \"Ibn Mohammad\". Or, Muhammad bin Idris asy-Syafi`i is always called \"Imam Al-Shafi'i\" instead of \"Imam Idris\" or \"Imam Muhammad\". This is how the Arabs refer to famous persons in their daily life. The same applies here; Sister of Aaron refers to \"daughter of Aaron's siblings'\", and daughter of Amram refers to \"direct lineage of Amram\" (Amram's descendents). This means that Mary was from the line of Amram, but not of Aaron's generation.\n\n\n"}

He received his bachelor's degree from Brown University where he studied political science. He worked in a factory and as a television news reporter before enrolling at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York City in the fall of 1979.\n\nDuring his time at law school, Bowers earned a position on the Cardozo Law review and worked part-time, first as a proofreader at a law firm and later as a researcher and writer for Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim and Ballon, a New York law firm. After his graduation he joined Phillips, Nizer, et al. as an associate.\n\nIn August 1984, Bowers joined Baker McKenzie as a litigation associate. Baker McKenzie is an international law firm, and Bowers hoped to use his knowledge of Italian, German, French, Dutch and Spanish. The following year, Bowers began to experience throbbing headaches and see yellow spots. He was diagnosed with meningitis. In April 1986, he was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma and AIDS.\n\nIn May 1986 the law firm's partners gave Bowers a satisfactory evaluation. Two months later, in July, they voted to dismiss him, without following normal termination procedures, including consulting with his supervisor or asking for a list of his clients and billable hours. His supervisors objected to the decision, delaying its implementation. However, in October, 12 of the 15 partners again voted to dismiss him. He left the company on December 5, 1986.\n\nBowers subsequently filed a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights alleging discrimination. On July 14, 1987, the New York State Division of Human Rights held the first hearings in the case in a trial format, with Judge Amos Carnegie overseeing the proceedings. A representative for the firm claimed that Bowers was dismissed because of performance issues, while his complaint charged that he had been fired from his job because of the skin lesions that had begun appearing on his body and face. Bowers died on September 30, 1987, in Boston at the age of 33, just two months after the hearings began. His long-term partner Alex Londres (a short story writer) died one year later, also of AIDS-related illness.\n\nThe hearings took place on 39 days over the course of two years. It took more than six years for the case to finally be resolved, when in December 1993 the agency awarded its largest sum for any complaint to that date: $500,000 in compensatory damages and the back pay he would have earned had he remained employed. Baker McKenzie appealed but subsequently withdrew the appeal in 1995 after they negotiated a confidential settlement with Bowers' family, forbidding parties from ever discussing the case or the terms of the agreement.\n\nBowers' family sued the writers and producers of the film \"Philadelphia\", claiming that it was based on Bowers' life. One year after Bowers' death, producer Scott Rudin had interviewed the Bowers family and their lawyers and, according to the Bowers family, promised them compensation. Family members claim that 54 scenes in the film were very similar to events in Bowers' life, and that some of the information in the film could only have come from their interviews. The defense said that after Rudin sold the film idea to Tri-Star Pictures, the studio which then went on to produce the film, he had no further involvement in its development, that he had never shared with the studio any of the information that had been provided to him by the Bowers family, and all screenplay material originating from the Bowers case had been taken only from publicly available sources. The lawsuit was settled in 1996. Although terms of the agreement were not released, the defendants did acknowledge that the film was \"inspired in part\" by Bowers' story. His life partner was Alex Londres who died from AIDS related illness one year after Bowers. Bowers' family of origin did not acknowledge Londres or include him in any way with the settlement, according to a letter he sent to a friend as he himself was struggling with the loss of his great love, Geoff.\n"}
{"id": "87384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87384", "title": "Hilary of Poitiers", "text": "Hilary of Poitiers\n\nHilary of Poitiers (; c. 310c. 367) was Bishop of Poitiers and is a Doctor of the Church. He was sometimes referred to as the \"Hammer of the Arians\" (Latin: \"Malleus Arianorum\") and the \"Athanasius of the West.\" His name comes from the Latin word for happy or cheerful. His optional memorial in the General Roman Calendar is 13 January. In the past, when this date was occupied by the Octave Day of the Epiphany, his feast day was moved to 14 January.\n\nHilary was born at Poitiers either at the end of the 3rd or beginning of the 4th century A.D. His parents were pagans of distinction. He received a good pagan education, which included a high level of Greek. He studied, later on, the Old and New Testament writings, with the result that he abandoned his Neo-Platonism for Christianity, and with his wife and his daughter (traditionally named Saint Abra), was baptized and received into the Church.\n\nThe Christians of Poitiers so respected Hilary that about 350 or 353, they unanimously elected him their bishop. At that time Arianism threatened to overrun the Western Church; Hilary undertook to repel the disruption. One of his first steps was to secure the excommunication, by those of the Gallican hierarchy who still remained orthodox Christians, of Saturninus, the Arian Bishop of Arles, and of Ursacius of Singidunum and Valens of Mursa, two of his prominent supporters.\n\nAbout the same time, Hilary wrote to Emperor Constantius II a remonstrance against the persecutions by which the Arians had sought to crush their opponents (\"Ad Constantium Augustum liber primus\", of which the most probable date is 355). Other Historians refer to this first book to Constantius as \"Book Against Valens,\" of which only fragments are extant. His efforts did not succeed at first, for at the synod of Biterrae (Béziers), summoned by the emperor in 356 with the professed purpose of settling the longstanding dispute, an imperial rescript banished the new bishop, along with Rhodanus of Toulouse, to Phrygia.\n\nHilary spent nearly four years in exile, although the reasons for this banishment remain obscure. The traditional explanation is that Hilary was exiled for refusing to subscribe to the condemnation of Athanasius and the Nicene faith. More recently several scholars have suggested that political opposition to Constantius and support of the usurper Silvanus may have led to Hilary's exile.\n\nWhile in Phrygia, however, he continued to govern his diocese, as well as writing two of the most important of his contributions to dogmatic and polemical theology: the \"De synodis\" or \"De fide Orientalium\", an epistle addressed in 358 to the Semi-Arian bishops in Gaul, Germany and Britain, analyzing the views of the Eastern bishops on the Nicene controversy. In reviewing the professions of faith of the Oriental bishops in the Councils of Ancyra, Antioch, and Sirmium, he sought to show that sometimes the difference between certain doctrines and orthodox beliefs was rather in the words than in the ideas, which led to his counseling the bishops of the West to be more reserved in their condemnation.\n\nThe \"De trinitate libri XII\", composed in 359 and 360, was the first successful expression in Latin of that Council's theological subtleties originally elaborated in Greek. Although some members of Hilary's own party thought the first had shown too great a forbearance towards the Arians, Hilary replied to their criticisms in the \"Apologetica ad reprehensores libri de synodis responsa\". Hilary was a firm guardian of the Trinity as taught by the Western church, and therefore saw the foreseen Antichrist in those who repudiated the divinity of the Son and thought Him to be but a created Being. \"Hence also they who deny that Christ is the Son of God must have Antichrist for their Christ,\" was the way he stated it.\n\nIn his classic introduction to the works of Hilary, Watson summarizes Hilary’s points:\n\nHilary also attended several synods during his time in exile, including the council at Seleucia (359) which saw the triumph of the \"homoion\" party and the forbidding of all discussion of the divine substance. In 360, Hilary tried unsuccessfully to secure a personal audience with Constantius, as well as to address the council which met at Constantinople in 360. When this council ratified the decisions of Ariminum and Seleucia, Hilary responded with the bitter \"In Constantium\", which attacked the Emperor Constantius as Antichrist and persecutor of orthodox Christians. Hilary's urgent and repeated requests for public debates with his opponents, especially with Ursacius and Valens, proved at last so inconvenient that he was sent back to his diocese, which he appears to have reached about 361, within a very short time of the accession of Emperor Julian.\n\nOn returning to his diocese in 361, Hilary spent most of the first two or three years trying to persuade the local clergy that the \"homoion\" confession was merely a cover for traditional Arian subordinationism. Thus, a number of synods in Gaul condemneded the creed promulgated at Council of Ariminium (359).\n\nIn about 360 or 361, with Hilary's encouragement, Martin, the future bishop of Tours, founded a monastery at Ligugé in his diocese.\n\nIn 364, Hilary extended his efforts once more beyond Gaul. He impeached Auxentius, bishop of Milan, a man high in the imperial favour, as heterodox. Emperor Valentinian I accordingly summoned Hilary to Milan to there maintain his charges. However, the supposed heretic gave satisfactory answers to all the questions proposed. Hilary denounced Auxentius as a hypocrite as he himself was ignominiously expelled from Milan. Upon returning home, Hilary in 365, published the \"Contra Arianos vel Auxentium Mediolanensem liber,\" describing his unsuccessful efforts against Auxentius. He also (but perhaps at a somewhat earlier date) published the \"Contra Constantium Augustum liber\", accusing the lately deceased emperor as having been the Antichrist, a rebel against God, \"a tyrant whose sole object had been to make a gift to the devil of that world for which Christ had suffered.\"\n\nAccording to Jerome, Hilary died in Poitiers in 367.\n\nRecent research has distinguished between Hilary's thought before his period of exile in Phrygia under Constantius and the quality of his later major works. While Hilary closely followed the two great Alexandrians, Origen and Athanasius, in exegesis and Christology respectively, his work shows many traces of vigorous independent thought.\n\nAmong Hilary's earliest writings, completed some time before his exile in 356, is his \"Commentarius in Evangelium Matthaei\", an allegorical exegesis of the first Gospel. This is the first Latin commentary on Matthew to have survived in its entirety. Hilary's commentary was strongly influenced by Tertullian and Cyprian, and made use of several classical writers, including Cicero, Quintilian, Pliny and the Roman historians.\n\nHilary's expositions of the Psalms, \"Tractatus super Psalmos\", largely follow Origen, and were composed some time after Hilary returned from exile in 360. Since Jerome found the work incomplete, no one knows whether Hilary originally commented on the whole Psalter. Now extant are the commentaries on Psalms 1, 2, 9, 13, 14, 51-69, 91, and 118-150.\n\nThe third surviving exegetical writing by Hilary is the \"Tractatus mysteriorum\", preserved in a single manuscript first published in 1887.\n\nBecause Augustine cites part of the commentary on Romans as by \"Sanctus Hilarius\" it has been ascribed by various critics at different times to almost every known Hilary.\n\nHilary's major theological work was the twelve books now known as \"De Trinitate\". This was composed largely during his exile, though perhaps not completed until his return to Gaul in 360.\n\nAnother important work is \"De synodis\", written early in 359 in preparation for the councils of Ariminium and Seleucia.\n\nVarious writings comprise Hilary's 'historical' works. These include the \"Liber II ad Constantium imperatorem\", the \"Liber in Constantium inperatorem\", \"Contra Arianos vel Auxentium Mediolanensem liber\", and the various documents relating to the Arian controversy in \"Fragmenta historica\".\n\nSome consider Hilary as the first Latin Christian hymn writer, because Jerome said Hilary produced a \"liber hymnorum\". Three hymns are attributed to him, though none are indisputable.\n\nHilary is the pre-eminent Latin writer of the 4th century (before Ambrose). Augustine of Hippo called him \"the illustrious doctor of the churches\", and his works continued to be highly influential in later centuries. Venantius Fortunatus wrote a \"vita\" of Hilary by 550, but few now consider it reliable. More trustworthy are the notices in Saint Jerome (De vir. illus. 100), Sulpicius Severus (\"Chron.\" ii. 39-45) and in Hilary's own writings.\nPope Pius IX formally recognized him as \"Universae Ecclesiae Doctor\" in 1851.\n\nIn the Roman calendar of saints, Hilary's feast day is on 13 January, 14 January in the pre-1970 form of the calendar. The spring terms of the English and Irish Law Courts and Oxford and Dublin Universities are called the Hilary term since they begin on approximately this date. Some consider Saint Hilary of Poitiers as the patron saint of lawyers.\n\nFrom his writing St. Hilary's symbol came to be three books and a quill pen.\n\nSulpicius Severus' \"Vita Sancti Martini\" led to a cult of Saint Hilary as well as of St. Martin of Tours which spread early to western Britain. The villages of St Hilary in Cornwall and Glamorgan and that of Llanilar in Ceredigion bear his name.\n\nIn France most dedications to Saint Hilary are styled \"Saint-Hilaire\" and lie west (and north) of the Massif Central; the cult in this region eventually extended to Canada.\n\nIn northwest Italy the church of Sant’Ilario at Casale Monferrato was dedicated to St. Hilary as early as 380.\n\n\n"}

The Mayor of Brussels, Freddy Thielemans, and the Mayor of Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Philippe Moureaux, described the shooting as a \"fait divers\" (a small daily news item) and \"normal in a large city\", causing controversy.\n\nLater in 2010, Ibrahim was sentenced to 10 years in prison, but was released on parole in 2014 under the condition that he did not leave the country for longer than a month. Following his release from prison, he collected €25,000 in Belgian government benefits until December 2015. He failed to abide by the conditions of parole and was sought again by the authorities.\n\nAccording to the authorities in Turkey, they arrested Ibrahim as a \"suspected terrorist\" in June 2015 and deported him to Europe, where he chose to go to the Netherlands. Belgian authorities were informed of the detention and deportation, but they apparently ignored the warnings, and the Netherlands released Ibrahim after failing to establish any link to terrorism.\n\nIbrahim and his brother Khalid were known to the Belgian authorities. Unlike other radicalised ISIL adherents, who started as petty criminals, the men had a history of committing more serious crimes. They were believed to have rented an apartment that housed some of the assailants involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks and supplied ammunition for them.\n\nOn 15 March 2016, Ibrahim and his brother Khalid evaded capture during a police raid in Brussels. On 16 March 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States sent information about them to authorities in the Netherlands. They had been tracking Ibrahim since September 2015.\n\nAuthorities found a laptop belonging to Ibrahim inside a waste container near a house raided following the bombings. The laptop had a suicide note stored on it, in which Ibrahim stated that he was \"stressed out\", felt unsafe, and was \"afraid of ever-lasting eternity\". It also contained images of the home and the office of the Belgian Prime Minister, Charles Michel, among information on multiple other locations in Brussels.\n\nIbrahim has been identified as one of the suicide bombers at the Brussels airport on 22 March 2016.\n\n"}

Earlier in his life he had worked as a prostitute and a drag queen, and had struggled at times with drug addiction. He died of complications from AIDS in 1990.\n\nHe established the Maitri Hospice at HSZC for students and friends dying of AIDS during the spread of the epidemic in the 1980s—the first Buddhist hospice of its kind in the United States. Numbers of his students and colleagues have observed that Dorsey was the embodiment of a bodhisattva.\n\nIssan Dorsey was born as Tommy Dorsey, Jr. in Santa Barbara, California in 1933. He was raised as a Catholic and was the youngest child of ten siblings. As a boy he aspired to become an entertainer and studied dance and piano. While in junior college he became dissatisfied with his life, so he left school and joined the U.S. Navy. In the military he was able to fulfill his childhood dream of being an entertainer, putting on shows at his base and on television shows. During the Korean War Dorsey and a male lover were expelled from the Navy, leaving him to spend several years in and out of employment. He finally settled into a job as a waiter for a bar in North Beach, eventually becoming a performer there as a drag queen. His shows were a success and he traveled in a road show known as The Party of Four. On the road in the 1950s he would sometimes work as a prostitute at shows and afterhours, developing a nasty methamphetamine addiction during this period. On the road during his shows Dorsey was introduced as, \"Tommy Dee, the boy who looks like the girl next door.\"\n\nIn the 1960s he returned to San Francisco, where he continued to shoot speed and engaged in dealing drugs on lower Haight Street. He founded his own commune and also managed a rock band. During this period he had a spiritual experience under the influence of LSD while observing a photograph of Ramana Maharshi. He constructed an altar with Maharshi's photograph, where he would shoot speed and gaze at the picture for several hours. Soon, he gave up using drugs and started sitting zazen at the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC) under the guidance of Shunryu Suzuki. In 1980 (while Dorsey was director of SFZC) he became a member of The Gay Buddhist Club, which eventually became known as the Hartford Street Zen Center (HSZC). Originally a discussion group for gay Buddhists, the group eventually began sitting zazen in the basement of one member's house at 57 Hartford Street. In 1987 Dorsey had created a hospice (Maitri Hospice) within the Zen center on Hartford Street, serving primarily gay men who were dying of AIDS. Eventually Dorsey was made a Sōtō priest by his teacher—Zentatsu Richard Baker—installed as abbot of HSZC in 1989 and given the Dharma name Issan (meaning \"One-Mountain\"). Shortly before death, in particularly poor health, Issan was recognized as a roshi. On September 6, 1990, Issan Dorsey died of complications linked to AIDS.\n\n"}
{"id": "2492500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2492500", "title": "Ivan Caryll", "text": "Ivan Caryll\n\nFélix Marie Henri Tilkin (12 May 1861 – 29 November 1921), better known by his pen name Ivan Caryll, was a Belgian composer of operettas and Edwardian musical comedies in the English language. He composed (or contributed to) some forty musical comedies and operettas.\n\nCaryll's career encompassed three eras of the musical theatre, and unlike some of his contemporaries, he adapted readily to each new development. After composing a few musical burlesques, his first great successes were made in light musical comedies, epitomised by the George Edwardes productions at London's Gaiety Theatre, such as \"The Shop Girl\", \"The Circus Girl\", \"The Gay Parisienne\", and \"A Runaway Girl\". He continued to write musical comedies throughout the next decade, including such hits as \"The Messenger Boy\", \"The Toreador\", \"The Girl From Kays\", \"The Earl and the Girl\", \"The Orchid\", \"The Spring Chicken\", \"The Girls of Gottenberg\" and \"Our Miss Gibbs\". He also wrote some operetta scores, such as \"The Duchess of Dantzic\". After this, he moved to New York City, where his post-war works, incorporating new fox-trot and one-step rhythms, included \"The Girl Behind the Gun\" (later a London hit as \"Kissing Time\"). At the peak of his career, he had the unparalleled distinction of having five musicals running at the same time in the West End.\n\nCaryll was born in Liège, Belgium, the son of Henry Tilkin, an engineer. He studied at the Liège Conservatoire, where he was a fellow student of Eugène Ysaÿe. He then moved to France to study singing at the Paris Conservatoire, where a classmate was Rose Caron. He moved to London in 1882. He was married for a time in the 1890s to Gilbert and Sullivan star Geraldine Ulmar. Later, he married Maud Hill. He had a daughter named Primrose Caryll, who became an actress.\n\nThe dashing, moustachioed Caryll was known as one of the best dressed men in London. He was an extravagant spender and a popular and lavish host, entertaining his theatrical friends in princely style. Caryll's free spending ways caused him trouble occasionally, and he had a few narrow escapes from his creditors.\n\nAt first, Caryll earned a poor living by giving music lessons to women in the suburbs. Then he sold some songs to George Edwardes, who eventually hired him as the musical director for the Gaiety and Lyric Theatres. He attempted to raise orchestral standards by banning the deputy system, under which a player who was offered a lucrative engagement could send a substitute to perform in the theatre.\n\nCaryll's first theatre piece was \"Lily of Léoville\" in 1886. He sent the score to Camille Saint-Saëns, who used his influence to have it staged at the Bouffes Parisiens. Violet Melnotte secured the English rights, and it was presented in London featuring a young Hayden Coffin. This was followed the same year by \"Monte Cristo Jr.\", a burlesque for the Gaiety and then by a number of shows produced for the Lyric, culminating with the very successful \"Little Christopher Columbus\" (1893). Caryll, known as a very expressive conductor, conducted W. S. Gilbert and Alfred Cellier's \"The Mountebanks\" at the Lyric in 1892. Cellier died during rehearsals for the piece, and Caryll wrote the overture, the entr'acte, and finished some of the orchestration. His work on the piece received critical praise. Also in 1892, with George Dance, Caryll adapted an opéra comique called \"Ma mie Rosette\", based on a French piece by Paul Lacôme, starring Jessie Bond and Courtice Pounds at the Globe Theatre. Caryll recalled of this production that he had been much criticised for adding numbers to Lacome's original score, although Lacome had specially requested him to do so.\n\nCaryll's first big success at the Gaiety was \"The Shop Girl\" (1894), which ran for an almost unprecedented 546 performances and heralded a new form of respectable musical comedy in London. The composer conducted the piece himself. Meanwhile, Caryll also had success elsewhere. \"The Gay Parisienne\" (1896), written with George Dance, ran for 369 performances at the Duke of York's Theatre, played in New York as \"The Girl from Paris\" (281 performances) and toured internationally. At the same time, he continued to compose shows at other theatres, including the comic opera \"Dandy Dick Whittington\" (1895), at the Avenue Theatre, with a libretto by George Robert Sims.\n\nCaryll composed the music for almost all the Gaiety musical comedies over the next decade, in collaboration with Lionel Monckton, and also established himself as the most famous conductor of light music in England. Edwardes apparently liked to have the word 'girl' in the titles of the shows, so \"The Shop Girl\" was followed by \"My Girl\", \"The Circus Girl\" (with over 500 performances in 1896 and 1897) and \"A Runaway Girl\" (1898). \"The Lucky Star\" was a less successful three-act comic opera (1899, produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, based on \"L'Etoile\", an opéra-bouffe by Emmanuel Chabrier). It may have been too risqué for the Savoy Theatre audiences.\n\nCaryll was said to compose very quickly in intense bouts. His scores were noted for swirling waltzes and semi-operatic finales. He often took trips to Paris and elsewhere in search of new musical plays that he could adapt into English. Caryll's output also included songs, dances and salon pieces for his own light orchestra, for which Edward Elgar composed his shapely \"Serenade Lyrique\" in 1899.\n\nAfter the turn of the century, Caryll wrote more successful scores, including \"The Messenger Boy\" (1900), \"The Toreador\" (1901) (with well over 600 performances), The Ladies' Paradise (1901) (the first musical comedy to be presented at the Metropolitan Opera in New York), \"The Girl From Kays\" (1902), \"The Cherry Girl\" (1902), \"The Earl and the Girl\" (1903; another success, starring Walter Passmore and Henry Lytton), \"The Orchid\" (1903), and \"The Duchess of Dantzic\" (1903), a comic opera based on the story of Napoleon and Madame Sans-Gêne, the washerwoman who married Marshal Lefebvre and became a duchess. During the Christmas season of 1903, he had what was at that time the unparalleled distinction of having five musicals running at the same time in the West End.\n\nDespite these successes, Caryll began to grow jealous of Monckton, who often wrote the most popular numbers in the shows. Still, they continued to work together, producing several successes: \"The Spring Chicken\" (1905), \"The New Aladdin\" (1906), \"The Girls of Gottenberg\" (1907), and the even more popular \"Our Miss Gibbs\" (1909), which ran for 636 performances. Typical of the plots of these shows, \"Our Miss Gibbs\" concerns a shop girl, courted by an earl in disguise. During this period, Caryll also wrote the less successful \"The Little Cherub\" (1906).\n\nMany of Caryll's musicals were given in Paris, Vienna, and Budapest at a time when the English-language musicals were largely ignored on the continent, and he composed original scores for Paris (\"S.A.R.\", or \"Son altesse royale\", 1908) and Vienna (\"Die Reise nach Cuba\", 1901).\n\nCaryll relocated to New York City in 1911, composing more than a dozen Broadway musicals, including \"The Pink Lady\" (1911, with Hugh Morton), \"Oh! Oh! Delphine!!!\" (1912), \"Chin-Chin\" (1914; including \"Ragtime Temple Bells\"), \"Jack o'Lantern\" (1917), and \"The Girl Behind the Gun\" (1918, with a book by P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton; the following year, it was a hit in London as \"Kissing Time\"). According to Wodehouse, Caryll was widely known as \"Fabulous Felix\", and \"lived \"en prince\" ... having apartments in both London and Paris as well as a villa containing five bathrooms overlooking the Deauville racecourse.\" He had just completed the music for \"Little Miss Raffles\" a day before his death.\n\nCaryll died of a haemorrhage in New York at age 60 while rehearsing \"Little Miss Raffles\".\n\n\n"}

He is the President of the Ruderman Family Foundation, which focuses on the inclusion of people with disabilities and on the education of Israeli leaders regarding the American Jewish community. The foundation maintains offices in Boston, Israel and New York City.\n\nRuderman was born on March 16, 1966. He is the oldest of three siblings, the son of Marcia and Morton E. Ruderman. The latter cofounded Meditech and other successful business ventures, dedicating his later life to helping others. Ruderman attended public schools in Lynnfield, Massachusetts, and received his undergraduate degree from Brandeis University, where he served as president of the student body in 1986-87. He earned his JD from Boston University School of Law in 1993. He served in the Israel Defense Forces as Liaison with the Jewish Diaspora.\n\nRuderman began his career as Assistant District Attorney in Essex County, Massachusetts.\n\nHe later worked for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), first as Deputy Director of the New England office and then as Leadership Director of the Jerusalem office.\n\nRuderman has been President of the Ruderman Family Foundation since 2008.\n\nRuderman grew the Ruderman Family Foundation from a local foundation serving the Boston Jewish community to one with an international focus. Under his leadership the Foundation seeks to change societal attitudes around disability and to advocate for the rights of people with disabilities. The philanthropic strategy of the Foundation is to go narrow and deep: it focuses on a limited number of issues and works with the media to raise awareness of those issues across all sectors of society. These issues center around changing societal attitudes so that disability inclusion is seen as central to civil rights and social justice, and not an issue of charity.\n\nThe Ruderman Family Foundation, led by Jay Ruderman, is an international leader in the intersection between social advocacy, disabilities, and inclusion. Part of its advocacy involves publishing white papers on different topics related to disabilities and inclusion.\n\nWith the foundation as his vehicle, Jay Ruderman has established himself as one of the leading voices for disability rights on social media. Ruderman has used social media in past years to respond to derogatory language used by public figures toward people with disabilities. Examples of derogatory language to which Ruderman responded include the video showing the rapper 50 Cent mocking a disabled airport employee, and the rude gestures made by President Donald Trump mimicking the disability of \"New York Times\" reporter Serge Kovaleski. The response to the Donald Trump episode led to the Foundation being featured during the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\n\nOn a daily basis Ruderman engages in rapid response activism, much of which is done through numerous op-eds he has written for major publications in the US and Israel. Recently, the Foundation launched the Ruderman Family Awards for Excellence in Reporting on Disability at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University. The prize seeks to encourage excellent reporting on disability, by recognizing the best disability reporting produced each year by media organizations around the world.\n\nRuderman has also put together several signature programs as part of his activist philanthropy. Among them is the Ruderman Prize in Inclusion, which recognizes organizations around the world that serve as exemplars of disability inclusion. Twenty Ruderman Prizes have been awarded since 2012.\n\nIn 2017, the Foundation hosted its second Ruderman Inclusion Summit, which was one of the world's largest gathering of disability activists with over 1,400 people in attendance. The first such summit was held two years before that, in November 2015 in Boston, with 500 leaders and activists. Plenary speakers at both summits included Oscar Award Winner Marlee Matlin, Former President of Malawi Joyce Banda, former Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), author Ron Suskind, Special Olympian Loretta Claiborne, Michigan State Supreme Court Justice Richard H. Bernstein, journalist and NPR host John Hockenberry, Senator Maggie Hassan (D–NH), Congressman Gregg Harper (R-MS), and Congressman Jim Langevin (D–RI).\nRuderman has also launched Link20, a leadership network for young disability advocates aiming to develop a young cross-disability movement through strengthening the leadership of the participants and helping them raise awareness and shatter stereotypes about people with disabilities. The network began in Israel and has spread to Boston, New York, and Washington DC.\n\nAn additional signature program is the Morton E. Ruderman Award in Inclusion, which has been given annually since 2013 to an individual for outstanding accomplishment in the field of disability inclusion. In 2013 the award was given to Michael Stein, co-founder and Executive Director of the Harvard Law School Project on Disability. In 2014 it was given to Ari Ne’eman, President and co-founder of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. In 2015, the recipient was Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa, retired), a writer of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The latest recipient was Oscar winning actress, Marlee Matlin.\n\nThe Foundation created the ADVANCE Conference series in 2011, 2012, and 2013 to educate the Jewish funding community about the issue of disability inclusion. As a result of those meetings the Disability Peer Network was founded at the Jewish Funders Network by the Foundation and others.\n\nIn addition to its activity surrounding people with disabilities, the Foundation led by Jay Ruderman also focuses on Israel-American Jewish relations and maintains major partnerships with the Government of Israel and many national Jewish organizations in the U.S. and Israel.\n\nIn November 2015, the Foundation organized a series of high-level events in Israel, focusing on the relationship between Israel and the American Jewish community. These included the Conference on Israel-American Jewish Relations, with speeches by former Israeli President and Nobel Peace Laureate Shimon Peres, former U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Connecticut), and U.S. Ambassador Daniel B. Shapiro; a public meeting of the Knesset Caucus on Israel-U.S. Relations; and the formal opening of the third year of Haifa University's Ruderman Program in American Jewish Studies.\n\nThe Foundation has also brought delegations of members of Israel's Knesset to the United States to expose them to the diversity of the U.S. Jewish community in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017. This program was instrumental in establishing the Knesset Caucus on Israel-U.S. Relations.\n\nIn 2013, with funding from the Foundation, Haifa University launched the Ruderman Program in American Jewish Studies, the only degree-granting program of its kind in Israel.\n\nThe Foundation also releases white papers on the topic of the US-Israel relationship, including one entitled \"The Jewish Vote: Political Power and Identity in US Elections\".\n\nJay has also called for a more democratic, representative and inclusive Jewish community, as shown in an op-ed for The Times of Israel.\n\nOver the years, an important part of Ruderman's activism has focused on Hollywood and the film industry, particularly its representation of people with disabilities and lack of inclusion of disabled actors in leading roles. Ruderman has publicly criticized Hollywood productions, and this has earned him much media coverage.\n\nMost recently, Ruderman publicly criticized the movie \"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot\" for casting Joaquin Phoenix in the role of a disabled man, instead of casting an actor with a disability.\n\nIn July 2017, Ruderman similarly condemned the movie Blind starring Alec Baldwin and Demi Moore on grounds that Baldwin played a blind character. Ruderman's main claim is that the movie \"is just the latest example of treating disability as a costume.\" He likened the casting of able-bodied actors to portray characters with disabilities to blackface and states that it's time for society to condemn the practice just like casting white actors to play black characters is no longer socially acceptable. The incident led to written exchanges between the movie's director, Michael Mailer, and Ruderman, both published by the industry publication Deadline.com.\n\nIn response to the release of the 2016 film Me Before You, Ruderman condemned the film's widely criticized portrayal of disability, in which the protagonistwho is paralyzedends up committing suicide because he feels his life is not worth living. Ruderman was widely quoted as stating, \"To the millions of people with significant disabilities currently leading fulfilling, rich lives, it posits that they are better off committing suicide.\" Ruderman's second major point in this controversy was that it is problematic for an able-bodied actor to play a character with a disabilitiy, a topic he often speaks up about. \nIn addition to commenting on movie productions, Ruderman has also released two white papers focusing on television content and people with disabilities.\n\nThe Ruderman Family Foundation was awarded the 2017 SAG-AFTRA Disability Awareness Award for its work in fighting for self-representation of people with disabilities on screen.\n\nJay Ruderman has received numerous awards for his work over the years including: \n\n\nRuderman is married to Israeli-American Shira Menashe Ruderman. They live in the Greater Boston area and have four children.\n\n"}

He was re-elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016.\n\nMoran was born in Great Bend, Kansas, the son of Madeline Eleanor (née Fletcher) and Raymond Edwin \"Ray\" Moran. He was raised in Plainville. He attended Fort Hays State University before enrolling at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 1976. While attending the University of Kansas, he worked as a summer intern for U.S. Representative Keith Sebelius in 1974, when impeachment proceedings were being prepared against President Richard Nixon.\n\nMoran worked as a banker before receiving his Juris Doctor from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1982. He practiced law at Stinson, Mag & Fizzell in Kansas City, and later joined Jeter & Larson Law Firm in Hays, where he practiced law for fifteen years. In addition to his law practice, he served as the state special assistant attorney general (1982–85) and deputy county attorney of Rooks County (1987–95). He also served as an adjunct professor of political science at Fort Hays State University.\n\nMoran served for eight years (1989–1997) in the Kansas Senate. He served two years as the Vice President and his last two years as majority leader.\n\nMoran was elected to Congress in 1996 and reelected five times, never facing serious opposition in the conservative 1st district. In 2006, his opponent for the 2006 midterm election was John Doll, against whom he received almost 79 percent of the vote—one of the highest totals for a Republican congressional incumbent in that election.\n\nDuring his time in the House of Representatives, Jerry Moran conducted an annual town hall meeting in each of the 69 counties in Kansas' \"Big First\" Congressional District. He continues the tradition in the U.S. Senate for all 105 counties.\n\nAs a senior member of the House Agriculture Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, then-Congressman Moran worked with colleagues to craft legislation to aid Kansas farms and ranches. Moran was also an active member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, where he served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health.\n\nSlate's David Weigel pointed out that, despite his insistence that earmarks are a way that get members of Congress to vote for spending \"that we can't afford,\" Moran requested $19.4 million in earmarks in the 2010 budget.\n\nMoran became the 2010 Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Kansas after defeating fellow Congressman Todd Tiahrt in the Republican primary, 50–45%. In the general election, Moran took 70 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Lisa Johnston, Libertarian Michael Dann, and Reform Party candidate Joe Bellis.\n\nMoran was elected Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 113th U.S. Congress on November 14, 2012. Moran oversaw the Republican gain of nine Senate seats in United States Senate elections, 2014, resulting in the first Republican Senate majority since 2006.\n\n\n\nMoran's voting record is highly conservative. He has a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union.\n\nThe \"Southwest Daily Times\" once quoted him as saying, \"I will always put Kansans ahead of the pressures in Washington\"—a quote he posted on his House Web site.\n\nMoran opposed the Medicare reform package of 2003, unlike most congressmen from rural districts. He also opposed the Affordable Care Act of 2010, the health care reform bill championed by President Obama.\n\nIn May 2011, Moran sponsored S. 1058, the Pharmacy Competition and Consumer Choice Act of 2011. In the House, he served as Co-Chairman of the House Rural Health Care Coalition and co-founder of the Congressional Community Pharmacy Coalition.\n\nMoran announced that he was voting 'no' on the July 2017 Senate health care bill. Moran criticized the closed-door process for developing the bill and criticized the legislation for not repealing the entire 2010 health law.\n\nSince 2014, Moran has served on the United States Air Force Academy Board of Visitors.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Moran opposed a timetable for military withdrawal from Iraq.\n\nSince entering Congress, Moran has traveled to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan to visit deployed American forces and meet with foreign leaders. His most recent trip to the region was in August 2017 to the Northern regions of Afghanistan.\n\nMoran critiqued President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order imposing a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, stating: \"While I support thorough vetting, I do not support restricting the rights of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Furthermore, far-reaching national security policy should always be devised in consultation with Congress and relevant government agencies.\"\n\nMoran supports accountability metrics for public schools, but believes federal initiatives need to provide flexibility to states. In 2001, Moran voted against passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) because he felt it did not afford sufficient flexibility to schools. In 2017, Moran voted to confirm Betsy DeVos as United States Secretary of Education.\n\nMoran has an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) for his consistent support of pro-gun policies. The NRA endorsed him for his 2010 Senate run. He was described as a \"steadfast supporter of our freedom,\" by NRA-Political Victory Fund chairman Chris W. Cox. Since 1998, the NRA has donated $23,850 to Moran's political efforts.\n\nIn 2013, Moran joined other Republicans in saying they would filibuster any Democrat's proposals that Republican's considered a threat to the Second Amendment. In April, Moran voted against the Manchin-Toomey proposal for universal background checks for gun purchases.\n\nMoran supports the concept of eliminating gun-free zones on military installations and recruitment centers. He stated that they are an \"infringement on the constitutional rights of our service members\" and that gun-free zones make military sites \"increasingly vulnerable to those who wish to do harm.\"\n\nIn 2016, Moran voted against the Feinstein Amendment, which would have banned suspected terrorists from acquiring guns.\n\nMoran responded to the 2017 Olathe, Kansas shooting stating \"I strongly condemn violence of any kind, especially if it is motivated by prejudice and xenophobia.\" \nIn response to the Orlando nightclub shooting and the Las Vegas shooting, Moran offered thoughts and prayers with his wife, Robba.\n\nAs of 2017, based on his environment-related votes, Moran had a lifetime score of 8% from the League of Conservation Voters, and a 0% score for 2016.\n\nMoran voted in 2015 against a Senate amendment acknowledging that human activity contributes to climate change. In 2016, Moran and several other Senate Republicans signed a letter calling upon the U.S. to withdraw funding from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In 2009, Moran voted against the American Clean Energy and Security Act (Waxman-Markey), which would have established a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.\n\nMoran is a strong supporter of the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. During the consideration of the Keystone XL pipeline legislation, Moran introduced an amendment to remove the lesser prairie chicken from the list of threatened species. The amendment failed on a 54–44 vote, having failed to get the required 60 votes.\n\nMoran is \"one of the most active members of Congress when it comes to reaching out to Silicon Valley.\" In 2014, Consumer Electronics Association President and CEO Gary Shapiro dubbed Moran, \"Mr. Innovation\" and described him as \"one of the biggest tech entrepreneurship leaders in the U.S. Senate.\" Moran is the lead sponsor of Startup Act 3.0 legislation which includes several provisions that would reform the American visa system for high-skilled, American educated, and entrepreneurial immigrants. Moran also sponsored the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, also known as the JOBS Act, legislation to expand crowdfunding options for startups. Since the bill's 2012 passage, he has criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's JOBS Act rulemaking as drawn out and potentially counter productive to the legislation's intent. Moran is an advocate of increased engagement between Washington and the Startup community and has spoken on the issue at events like South by Southwest (SXSW) and the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\n\nMoran opposed the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). On November 2011, Moran, along with Republican Senator Rand Paul and Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Maria Cantwell, sent a letter to Senate Leadership indicating they would place a Senate hold on PIPA, citing the threats PIPA (and SOPA) posed to liberty and innovation.\n\nIn 2017, Moran voted to repeal FCC Internet privacy rules that blocked internet providers from sharing or selling data on customers' private data (such as browsing history) without the customer's permission.\n\nMoran opposes abortion. He has cosponsored legislation to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy.\n\nMoran opposes same-sex marriage. The Human Rights Campaign has rated his voting record as zero in five separate scorecards.\n\nMoran had lived in Hays for most of his political career. However, in 2012 he moved to Manhattan. He wanted to be closer to a major airport in order to cut down on his drive time back to Kansas each weekend. The nearest airport to Hays is Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport, some three hours south-east; in contrast Manhattan is two hours from Wichita and Kansas City. Additionally, Manhattan Regional Airport has direct jet service daily to and from Chicago and Dallas.\n\nAt Kansas State University, he was initiated into Alpha Tau Omega on September 28, 2013.\n\nMoran volunteers his time with several community organizations. He is a former trustee of the Eisenhower Foundation, serves on the Board of Trustees of the Fort Hays State University Endowment Association, and serves on the Executive Committee of the Coronado Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He was also the 2008 Honorary Chair of the Law Enforcement Torch Run of the Kansas Special Olympics. Moran and his wife, Robba, have two daughters, Kelsey and Alex. Kelsey graduated from Kansas State University in 2010 and from Georgetown University Law Center in 2015. She is now an attorney at Hogan Lovells. Alex studied at Kansas State University and graduated from Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine in 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "63092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63092", "title": "Joseph Stiglitz", "text": "Joseph Stiglitz\n\nJoseph Eugene Stiglitz (; born February 9, 1943) is an American economist, public policy analyst, and a professor at Columbia University. He is a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2001) and the John Bates Clark Medal (1979). He is a former senior vice president and chief economist of the World Bank and is a former member and chairman of the (US president's) Council of Economic Advisers. He is known for his support of Georgist public finance theory and for his critical view of the management of globalization, of \"laissez-faire\" economists (whom he calls \"free market fundamentalists\"), and of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\nIn 2000, Stiglitz founded the Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD), a think tank on international development based at Columbia University. He has been a member of the Columbia faculty since 2001, and received that university's highest academic rank (university professor) in 2003. He was the founding chair of the university's Committee on Global Thought. He also chairs the University of Manchester's Brooks World Poverty Institute. He is a member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. In 2009, the President of the United Nations General Assembly Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, appointed Stiglitz as the chairman of the U.N. Commission on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System, where he oversaw suggested proposals and commissioned a report on reforming the international monetary and financial system. He served as chair of the international Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, appointed by President Sarkozy of France, which issued its report in 2010, \"Mismeasuring our Lives: Why GDP doesn't add up,\" and currently serves as co-chair of its successor, the High Level Expert Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. From 2011 to 2014, Stiglitz was president of the International Economic Association (IEA). He presided over the organization of the IEA triennial world congress held near the Dead Sea in Jordan in June 2014.\n\nStiglitz has received more than 40 honorary degrees, including from Cambridge and Harvard, and he has been decorated by several governments including Bolivia, Korea, Colombia, Ecuador, and most recently France, where he was appointed a member of the Legion of Honor, order Officer.\n\nIn 2011 Stiglitz was named by \"Time\" magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Stiglitz's work focuses on income distribution from a Georgist perspective, asset risk management, corporate governance, and international trade. He is the author of several books, the latest being \"The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe (2016),\" \"The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them\" (2015), \"Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy: An Agenda for Growth and Shared Prosperity\" (2015), and \"Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth Development and Social Progress\" (2014).\n\nStiglitz was born in Gary, Indiana, to Charlotte (née Fishman), a schoolteacher, and Nathaniel David Stiglitz, an insurance salesman. Stiglitz graduated from Amherst College in 1964, where he was a highly active member of the debate team and president of the student government. During his senior year at Amherst College, he studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he later pursued graduate work. From 1965 to 1966, he moved to the University of Chicago to do research under Hirofumi Uzawa who had received an NSF grant. He studied for his PhD from MIT from 1966 to 1967, during which time he also held an MIT assistant professorship. Stiglitz stated that the particular style of MIT economics suited him well, describing it as \"simple and concrete models, directed at answering important and relevant questions.\"\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970 he was a research fellow at the University of Cambridge. Stiglitz initially arrived at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge as a Fulbright Scholar in 1965, and he later won a Tapp Junior Research Fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge which was instrumental in shaping his understanding of Keynes and macroeconomic theory. In subsequent years, he held academic positions at Yale, Stanford, and Princeton. Stiglitz is now a professor at Columbia University, with appointments at the Business School, the Department of Economics and the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), and is editor of \"The Economists' Voice\" journal with J. Bradford DeLong and Aaron Edlin.\n\nHe also gives classes for a double-degree program between Sciences Po Paris and École Polytechnique in 'Economics and Public Policy'. He has chaired The Brooks World Poverty Institute at the University of Manchester since 2005. Stiglitz is widely considered a New-Keynesian economist, although at least one economics journalist says his work cannot be so clearly categorised.\n\nIn addition to making numerous influential contributions to macroeconomics, Stiglitz has played a number of policy roles. He served in the Clinton administration as the chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisers (1995–1997). At the World Bank, he served as senior vice-president and chief economist (1997–2000), in the time when unprecedented protest against international economic organizations started, most prominently with the Seattle WTO meeting of 1999. He was fired by the World Bank for expressing dissent with its policies. He was a lead author of the 1995 Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.\n\nHe is a member of Collegium International, an organization of leaders with political, scientific, and ethical expertise whose goal is to provide new approaches in overcoming the obstacles in the way of a peaceful, socially just and an economically sustainable world. He is also a member of the scientific committee of the Fundacion IDEAS, a Spanish think tank and a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2001.\n\nStiglitz has advised American president Barack Obama, but has also been sharply critical of the Obama Administration's financial-industry rescue plan. Stiglitz said that whoever designed the Obama administration's bank rescue plan is \"either in the pocket of the banks or they're incompetent.\"\n\nIn October 2008, he was asked by the President of the United Nations General Assembly to chair a commission drafting a report on the reasons for and solutions to the financial crisis. In response, the commission produced the Stiglitz Report.\n\nOn July 25, 2011, Stiglitz participated in the \"I Foro Social del 15M\" organized in Madrid (Spain) expressing his support to the 2011 Spanish protests.\n\nStiglitz was the president of the International Economic Association from 2011 to 2014.\n\nOn September 27, 2015, the United Kingdom Labour Party announced that Stiglitz was to sit on its Economic Advisory Committee along with five other world leading economists.\n\n After the 2018 mid-term elections in the United States he wrote a statement about the importance of economic justice to the survival of democracy worldwide.\n\nAfter getting his PhD from M.I.T in 1967, Stiglitz co-authored one of his first papers with Michael Rothschild for the Journal of Economic Theory in 1970. Stiglitz and Rothschild extrapolated on previous works by prominent economists such as Robert Solow to work on the concept of risk aversion, which is the behavior in humans to lower the uncertainty presented in the risk situation. Stiglitz and Rothschild's paper's primary focus was on defining \"When is a random variable 'Y' more variable than another random variable 'X'.\" In this mathematically complex paper, Stiglitz and Rothschild showed four plausible answers to this question, which led them to write the second paper, in which they analyzed the likely economic effects of increasing risk. They examine an individual's return on savings, portfolio problem, portfolio-savings problem and a firm's production problem. These papers allowed Stiglitz to earn the John Bates Clark Medal in 1979.\n\nStiglitz made early contributions to a theory of public finance stating that an optimal supply of local public goods can be funded entirely through capture of the land rents generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the 'Henry George theorem' in reference to the radical classical economist Henry George who famously advocated for land value tax. The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by at least as much as its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a single tax on rents is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.\n\nStiglitz's most famous research was on screening, a technique used by one economic agent to extract otherwise private information from another. It was for this contribution to the theory of information asymmetry that he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2001 \"for laying the foundations for the theory of markets with asymmetric information\" with George A. Akerlof and A. Michael Spence.\n\nBefore the advent of models of imperfect and asymmetric information, the traditional neoclassical economics literature had assumed that markets are efficient except for some limited and well defined market failures. More recent work by Stiglitz and others reversed that presumption, to assert that it is only under exceptional circumstances that markets are efficient. Stiglitz has shown (together with Bruce Greenwald) that \"whenever markets are incomplete and/or information is imperfect (which are true in virtually all economies), even competitive market allocation is not constrained Pareto efficient\". In other words, they addressed \"the problem of determining when tax interventions are Pareto-improving. The approach indicates that such tax interventions almost always exist and that equilibria in situations of imperfect information are rarely constrained Pareto optima.\" Although these conclusions and the pervasiveness of market failures do not necessarily warrant the state intervening broadly in the economy, it makes clear that the \"optimal\" range of government recommendable interventions is definitely much larger than the traditional \"market failure\" school recognizes. For Stiglitz, there is no such thing as an invisible hand, in the sense that free markets lead to efficiency as if guided by unseen forces. According to Stiglitz:\n\nIn an interview in 2007, Stiglitz explained further:\n\nThe preceding claim is based on Stiglitz 1986 paper, \"Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets\", which describes a general methodology to deal with externalities and for calculating optimal corrective taxes in a general equilibrium context. In the opening remarks for his prize acceptance at Aula Magna, Stiglitz said:\n\nStiglitz also did research on efficiency wages, and helped create what became known as the \"Shapiro-Stiglitz model\" to explain why there is unemployment even in equilibrium, why wages are not bid down sufficiently by job seekers (in the absence of minimum wages) so that everyone who wants a job finds one, and to question whether the neoclassical paradigm could explain involuntary unemployment. An answer to these puzzles was proposed by Shapiro and Stiglitz in 1984: \"Unemployment is driven by the information structure of employment\". Two basic observations undergird their analysis:\n\n\nA full description of this model can be found at the links provided. Some key implications of this model are:\n\n\nThe outcome is never Pareto efficient.\n\n\nWhile the mathematical validity of Stiglitz \"et al.\" theorems are not in question, their practical implications in political economy and their application in real life economic policies have been subject to disagreement and debate. Stiglitz himself has evolved his political-economic discourse over time.\n\nObjections to the wide adoption of positions suggested by Stiglitz's discoveries do not come from economics itself, but mostly from political scientists, especially in the field of sociology. As David L. Prychitko discusses in his \"critique\" to \"Whither Socialism?\" (see below), although Stiglitz's main economic insight seems generally correct, it still leaves open great constitutional questions such as how the coercive institutions of the government should be constrained and what the relation is between the government and civil society.\n\nStiglitz joined the Clinton Administration in 1993, serving first as a member during 1993–1995, and was then appointed Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers on June 28, 1995, in which capacity he also served as a member of the cabinet. He became deeply involved in environmental issues, which included serving on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and helping draft a new law for toxic wastes (which was never passed).\n\nStiglitz's most important contribution in this period was helping define a new economic philosophy, a \"third way\", which postulated the important, but limited, role of government, that unfettered markets often did not work well, but that government was not always able to correct the limitations of markets. The academic research that he had been conducting over the preceding 25 years provided the intellectual foundations for this \"third way\".\n\nWhen President Bill Clinton was re-elected, he asked Stiglitz to continue to serve as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for another term. But he had already been approached by the World Bank to be its senior vice president for development policy and its chief economist, and he assumed that position after his CEA successor was confirmed on February 13, 1997.\n\nAs the World Bank began its ten-year review of the transition of the former Communist countries to the market economy it unveiled failures of the countries that had followed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shock therapy policies both in terms of the declines in GDP and increases in poverty that were even worse than the worst that most of its critics had envisioned at the onset of the transition. Clear links existed between the dismal performances and the policies that the IMF had advocated, such as the voucher privatization schemes and excessive monetary stringency. Meanwhile, the success of a few countries that had followed quite different strategies suggested that there were alternatives that could have been followed. The US Treasury had put enormous pressure on the World Bank to silence his criticisms of the policies which they and the IMF had pursued.\n\nStiglitz always had a poor relationship with Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. In 2000, Summers successfully petitioned for Stiglitz's removal, supposedly in exchange for World Bank President James Wolfensohn's re-appointment an exchange that Wolfensohn denies took place. Whether Summers ever made such a blunt demand is questionable Wolfensohn claims he would \"have told him to *** himself\".\n\nStiglitz resigned from the World Bank in January 2000, a month before his term expired. The Bank's president, James Wolfensohn, announced Stiglitz's resignation in November 1999 and also announced that Stiglitz would stay on as Special Advisor to the President, and would chair the search committee for a successor.\n\nIn this role, he continued criticism of the IMF, and, by implication, the US Treasury Department. In April 2000, in an article for \"The New Republic\", he wrote:\n\nThe article was published a week before the annual meetings of the World Bank and IMF and provoked a strong response. It proved too strong for Summers and, yet more lethally, Stiglitz's protector-of-sorts at the World Bank, Wolfensohn. Wolfensohn had privately empathised with Stiglitz's views, but this time was worried for his second term, which Summers had threatened to veto. Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the IMF, called a special staff meeting and informed at that gathering that Wolfensohn had agreed to fire Stiglitz. Meanwhile, the Bank's External Affairs department told the press that Stiglitz had not been fired, his post had merely been abolished.\n\nIn a September 19, 2008 radio interview, with Aimee Allison and Philip Maldari on Pacifica Radio's KPFA 94.1 FM in Berkeley, California, US, Stiglitz implied that President Clinton and his economic advisors would not have backed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) had they been aware of stealth provisions, inserted by lobbyists, that they overlooked.\n\nIn July 2000, Stiglitz founded the Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD), with support of the Ford, Rockefeller, McArthur, and Mott Foundations and the Canadian and Swedish governments, to enhance democratic processes for decision-making in developing countries and to ensure that a broader range of alternatives are on the table and more stakeholders are at the table.\n\nAt the beginning of 2008, Stiglitz chaired the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, also known as the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, initiated by President Sarkozy of France. The Commission held its first plenary meeting on April 22–23, 2008, in Paris. Its final report was made public on September 14, 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Stiglitz chaired the Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System which was convened by the President of the United Nations General Assembly \"to review the workings of the global financial system, including major bodies such as the World Bank and the IMF, and to suggest steps to be taken by Member States to secure a more sustainable and just global economic order\". Its final report was released on September 21, 2009.\n\nIn 2010, Professor Stiglitz acted as an advisor to the Greek government during the Greek debt crisis. He appeared on Bloomberg TV for an interview on the risks of Greece defaulting, in which he stated that he was very confident that Greece would not default. He went on to say that Greece was under \"speculative attack\" and though it had \"short-term liquidity problems ... and would benefit from Solidarity Bonds\", the country was \"on track to meet its obligations\".\n\nThe next day, during a BBC interview, Stiglitz stated that \"there's no problem of Greece or Spain meeting their interest payments\". He argued nonetheless, that it would be desirable and needed for all of Europe to make a clear statement of belief in social solidarity and that they \"stand behind Greece\". Confronted with the statement: \"Greece's difficulty is that the magnitude of debt is far greater than the capacity of the economy to service\", Stiglitz replied, \"That's rather absurd\".\n\nIn 2012, Stiglitz described the European austerity plans as a \"suicide-pact\".\n\nSince March 2012, Stiglitz has been a member of the Scottish Government's Fiscal Commission Working Group, which oversees the work to establish a fiscal and macro economic framework for an independent Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nTogether with Professors Andrew Hughes Hallett, Sir James Mirrlees and Frances Ruane Stiglitz will \"advise on the establishment of a credible Fiscal Commission which entrenches financial responsibility and ensures market confidence\".\n\nIn July 2015, Stiglitz endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said: \"I am not surprised at all that there is a demand for a strong anti-austerity movement around increased concern about inequality. The promises of New Labour in the UK and of the Clintonites in the US have been a disappointment.\"\n\nOn September 27, 2015, it was announced that he had been appointed to the British Labour Party's Economic Advisory Committee, convened by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and reporting to Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, although he reportedly failed to attend the first meeting.\n\nOn July 25, 2011, Stiglitz participated in the \"I Foro Social del 15M\" organized in Madrid (Spain) expressing his support for the anti-austerity movement in Spain. During an informal speech, he made a brief review of some of the problems in Europe and in the United States, the serious unemployment rate and the situation in Greece. \"This is an opportunity for economic contribution social measures\", argued Stiglitz, who made a critical speech about the way authorities are handling the political exit to the crisis. He encouraged those present to respond to the bad ideas, not with indifference, but with good ideas. \"This does not work, you have to change it\", he said.\n\nStiglitz has been critical of rating agencies, describing them as the \"key culprit\" in the financial crisis, noting \"they were the party that performed the alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the rating agencies.\"\n\nStiglitz co-authored a paper with Peter Orszag in 2002 titled \"Implications of the New Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Risk-Based Capital Standard\" where they stated \"on the basis of historical experience, the risk to the government from a potential default on GSE debt is effectively zero.\" However, \"the risk-based capital standard ... may fail to reflect the probability of another Great Depression-like scenario.\"\n\nStiglitz warned that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) presented \"grave risks\" and it \"serves the interests of the wealthiest.\"\n\nStiglitz also opposed the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) trade deal between the European Union (EU) and the United States, and has argued that the United Kingdom should consider its withdrawal from the EU in the 2016 referendum on the matter if TTIP passes, saying that \"the strictures imposed by TTIP would be sufficiently averse to the functioning of government that it would make me think over again about whether membership of the EU was a good idea\".\n\nStiglitz argues that relying solely on business self-interest as the means of achieving the well-being of society and economic efficiency is misleading, and that instead \"What is needed is stronger norms, clearer understandings of what is acceptable and what is not and stronger laws and regulations to ensure that those that do not behave in ways that are consistent with these norms are held accountable\".\n\nStiglitz argues that land value tax would improve the efficiency and equity of agricultural economies. Stiglitz believes that societies should rely on a generalized Henry George principle to finance public goods, protect natural resources, improve land use, and reduce the burden of rents and taxes on the poor while increasing productive capital formation. Stiglitz advocates taxing \"natural resource rents at as close to 100 percent as possible\" and that a corollary of this principle is that polluters should be taxed for \"activities that generate negative externalities.\" Stiglitz therefore asserts that land value taxation is even better than its famous advocate Henry George thought.\n\nIn a September 2016 interview Stiglitz stated that \"the cost of keeping the Eurozone together probably exceeds the cost of breaking it up.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, he wrote that \"\"countries in North America and Europe should eliminate all tariffs and quotas\" (protectionist measures)\". He now advises the eurozone countries to control their trade balance with Germany by means of export/import certificates or \"trade chits\" (a protectionist measure).\n\nCiting Keynesian theory, he explains that trade deficits are harmful: \"\"John Maynard Keynes pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a \"negative externality\" on trading partners. Indeed, Keynes believed it was surplus countries, far more than those in deficit, that posed a threat to global prosperity; he went so far as to advocate a tax on surplus countries\"\".\n\nStiglitz writes: \"Germany's surplus means that the rest of Europe is in deficit. And the fact that these countries import more than they export contributes to the weakness of their economies\". He thinks that surplus countries are getting richer at the expense of deficit countries. He notes that the euro is the cause of this deficit and that as the trade deficit declines GDP would rise and unemployment would fall: \"The euro system means that Germany's exchange rate cannot increase compared to other euro area members. If the exchange rate were to rise, Germany would have more difficulty exporting and its economic model, based on strong exports, would cease. At the same time, the rest of Europe would export more, GDP would rise and unemployment would fall\".\n\nHe also thinks that the rest of the world should impose a carbon-adjustment tax (a protectionist measure) on American exports that do not comply with global standard.\n\nContrary to Keynesian theory and these analyses on the eurozone, he argues that the United States must not rebalance the trade account and can no longer apply protectionist measures to protect or recreate the well-paying manufacturing jobs. The United States must simply agree to be the \"losers\", saying: \"The very Americans who have been among the losers of globalization stand to be among the losers of a reversal of globalization. History cannot be put into reverse\".\nHowever, contrary to these statements, he admits that as the trade deficit declines \"GDP would rise and unemployment would fall\", further stating: \"Countries that import more than they export contributes to the weakness of their economie\". He notes that trade deficits caused by free trade destroy manufacturing jobs: the increase in the \"value of the dollar will lead to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs\".\n\nContrary to most economists historians, who argue that tariffs have played only a minor role or not at all in the Great Depression, Stiglitz thinks that the United States should not protect its economy because tariffs contributed to the Great Depression: \"Following that, U.S. exports fell by some 50 percent—contributing to our Great Depression\".\n\nHe denounces neoliberalism but yet advises the United States to pursue free trade (deregulation or liberalization of foreign trade) which is considered to be a constitutive policy of neoliberalism.\n\nAccording to him, it is not China (which has a large trade surplus) that makes \"trade war\", but the United States (which has a large trade deficit). He defends China's trade surpluses at the expense of the United States and he advises China to take sanctions against the United States. He believes that China should \"react with strength and intelligence\" and hit the United States \"where it hurts economically and politically\" if the United States tries to protect its industry and rebalance its trade account through tariffs, saying: \"For example, cutbacks in purchases by China will lead to more unemployment in congressional districts that are vulnerable, influential, or both\". ... China can retaliate anywhere it chooses, such as by using trade restrictions to target jobs in the congressional districts of those who support US tariffs. ... China may be more effective in targeting its retaliation to cause acute political pain. ... It's anybody's guess who can stand the pain better. Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth in excess of 6%?\".\n\nAbout China, he writes that the decline in exports is not prejudicial if China replaces \"export dependence to a model of growth driven by domestic demand\", therefore it's not the involvement in international trade per se that brings economic growth, but rather the access to strong demand. And it is not the level of exports that matters but rather the trade balance (gap between imports and exports). Regarding the United States, he writes the opposite: \"Walking away from globalization may reduce our imports, but it will also reduce exports in tandem. And, almost surely, jobs will be destroyed faster than they will be created: there may even be fewer net manufacturing jobs\". If the United States tries to control the movement of goods, \"they surely will lose\".\n\nIn early 2017, he wrote that \"the American middle class is indeed the loser of globalization\" and \"China, with its large emerging middle class, is among the big beneficiaries of globalization\". \"Thanks to globalisation, in terms of purchasing-power parity, China actually has already become the largest economy in the world in September 2015\". However, he then changed his mind and argued that the fall in wages and the disappearance of well-paid jobs in the United States, are not due to globalization, but are only inevitable collateral damage to the march of economic progress and technological innovation: \"The United States can only push for advanced manufacturing, which requires higher skill sets and employs fewer people. Rising inequality, meanwhile, will continue ...\". Finally, he changed his mind again in late 2017 and wrote that the drop in wages in the United States, is not a normal process and is solely due to the actions of multinational companies, not to the trade account imbalances between countries caused by free trade: \"It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers\". So it is no longer the surplus countries that have benefited from free trade, but only companies.\n\nIn 2016, he said he believes that the economic situation of the United States is critical: \"As the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton showed in their study published in December 2015, life expectancy among middle-age white Americans is declining, as rates of suicides, drug use, and alcoholism increase. A year later, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that life expectancy for the country as a whole has declined for the first time in more than 20 years.\" ... With the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for swaths of the country\". However, he changed his mind again in 2017 and now thinks that the effect of globalization on the American economy is not so serious today: \"Yes, America faces a variety of problems—it always has, and what nation doesn't?\".\n\nAlong with his technical economic publications (he has published over 300 technical articles), Stiglitz is the author of books on issues from patent law to abuses in international trade.\n\nFrom the jacket: In \"The Great Divide\", Joseph E. Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book \"The Price of Inequality\" and suggests ways to counter America's growing problem. Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities.\n\nCreating a Learning Society, (co authored with Bruce C. Greenwald), cast light on the significance of this insight for economic theory and policy. Taking as a starting point Kenneth J. Arrow's 1962 paper \"Learning by Doing,\" they explain why the production of knowledge differs from that of other goods and why market economies alone typically do not produce and transmit knowledge efficiently. Closing knowledge gaps and helping laggards learn are central to growth and development. But creating a learning society is equally crucial if we are to sustain improved living standards in advanced countries.\n\nFrom the jacket: As those at the top continue to enjoy the best health care, education, and benefits of wealth, they often fail to realize that, as Joseph E. Stiglitz highlights, \"their fate is bound up with how the other 99 percent live ... It does not have to be this way. In \"The Price of Inequality\" Stiglitz lays out a comprehensive agenda to create a more dynamic economy and fairer and more equal society\"\n\nThe book received the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights 2013 Book Award, given annually to the book that \"most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity.\"\n\nIn \"Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy\", Stiglitz discusses the causes of the 2008 recession/depression and goes on to propose reforms needed to avoid a repetition of a similar crisis, advocating government intervention and regulation in a number of areas. Among the policy-makers he criticises are George W. Bush, Larry Summers, and Barack Obama.\n\n\"The Three Trillion Dollar War\" (co-authored with Linda Bilmes) examines the full cost of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses the extent to which these costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention to the enormous expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. Stiglitz was openly critical of George W. Bush at the time the book was released.\n\nIn \"\", Stiglitz, José Antonio Ocampo (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC) and Deepak Nayyar (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) discuss the current debates on macroeconomics, capital market liberalization and development, and develop a new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the Washington Consensus has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith in the role of markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.\n\n\"Making Globalization Work\" surveys the inequities of the global economy, and the mechanisms by which developed countries exert an excessive influence over developing nations. Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilised. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are needed to address these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.\n\nStiglitz is an exception to the general pro-globalisation view of professional economists, according to economist Martin Wolf. Stiglitz argues that economic opportunities are not widely enough available, that financial crises are too costly and too frequent, and that the rich countries have done too little to address these problems. \"Making Globalization Work\" has sold more than two million copies.\n\nIn \"Fair Trade for All\", authors Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton argue that it is important to make the trading world more development friendly. The idea is put forth that the present regime of tariffs and agricultural subsidies is dominated by the interests of former colonial powers and needs to change. The removal of the bias toward the developed world will be beneficial to both developing and developed nations. The developing world is in needs of assistance, and this can only be achieved when developed nations abandon mercantilist based priorities and work towards a more liberal world trade regime.\n\n\"The Roaring Nineties\" is Stiglitz' analysis of the boom and bust of the 1990s. Presented from an insider's point of view, firstly as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, and later as chief economist of the World Bank, it continues his argument on how misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to the global economic issues of today, with a perceptive focus on US policies.\n\nIn \"Globalization and Its Discontents\", Stiglitz argues that what are often called \"developing economies\" are, in fact, not developing at all, and puts much of the blame on the IMF.\n\nStiglitz bases his argument on the themes that his decades of theoretical work have emphasized: namely, what happens when people lack the key information that bears on the decisions they have to make, or when markets for important kinds of transactions are inadequate or don't exist, or when other institutions that standard economic thinking takes for granted are absent or flawed. Stiglitz stresses the point: \"Recent advances in economic theory\" (in part referring to his own work) \"have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets incomplete, which is to say always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly.\" As a result, Stiglitz continues, governments can improve the outcome by well-chosen interventions. Stiglitz argues that when families and firms seek to buy too little compared to what the economy can produce, governments can fight recessions and depressions by using expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to spur the demand for goods and services. At the microeconomic level, governments can regulate banks and other financial institutions to keep them sound. They can also use tax policy to steer investment into more productive industries and trade policies to allow new industries to mature to the point at which they can survive foreign competition. And governments can use a variety of devices, ranging from job creation to manpower training to welfare assistance, to put unemployed labor back to work and cushion human hardship.\n\nStiglitz complains bitterly that the IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow in order to qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is creditworthy. The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutions all of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make sense for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.\n\n\"Whither Socialism?\" is based on Stiglitz's Wicksell Lectures, presented at the Stockholm School of Economics in 1990 and presents a summary of information economics and the theory of markets with imperfect information and imperfect competition, as well as being a critique of both free market and market socialist approaches (see Roemer critique, op. cit.). Stiglitz explains how the neoclassical, or Walrasian model (\"Walrasian economics\" refers to the result of the process which has given birth to a formal representation of Adam Smith's notion of the \"invisible hand\", along the lines put forward by Léon Walras and encapsulated in the general equilibrium model of Arrow–Debreu), may have wrongly encouraged the belief that market socialism could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model, based on the information economics established by the Greenwald–Stiglitz theorems.\n\nOne of the reasons Stiglitz sees for the critical failing in the standard neoclassical model, on which market socialism was built, is its failure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from the costs of acquiring information. He also identifies problems arising from its assumptions concerning completeness.\n\nStiglitz wrote a series of papers and held a series of conferences explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages. As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist at the World Bank, Stiglitz was able to put some of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.\n\nIn addition to being awarded the Nobel Memorial prize, Stiglitz has over 40 honorary doctorates and at least eight honorary professorships as well as an honorary deanship.\n\nIn 2011, he was named by \"Foreign Policy\" magazine on its list of top global thinkers. In February 2012, he was awarded the Legion of Honor, in the rank of Officer, by the French ambassador in the United States François Delattre. Stiglitz was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2009. Stiglitz was awarded the 2018 Sydney Peace Prize.\n\nStiglitz married Jane Hannaway in 1978; the couple later divorced. He got married for the third time on October 28, 2004 to Anya Schiffrin, who works at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. He has four children, Siobhan, Michael, Edward (Jed) and Julia as well as three grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Known for her naturally large 34GG breasts, she went on to feature in a wide range of adult magazines, websites, broadcast media, and videos, including hardcore pornography productions after 2000.\n\nShe has attained minor celebrity status in the United Kingdom, where she has appeared on a number of mainstream television programmes, such as \"They Think It's All Over\", \"I'm Famous and Frightened!\", \"The Weakest Link\", and \"Celebrity Four Weddings\". She has also appeared in documentaries about the lives of glamour models and was featured in Martin Gooch's 2002 film \"Arthur's Amazing Things\".\n\nIn early 1994 when McKenzie was 15, she sent sample glamour photographs to local modelling agencies. She began her modelling career glamour modelling and swimsuit work, intending to progress to topless modelling when she turned 16 later that year.\nAs McKenzie approached her 16th birthday, the \"Sunday Sport\" tabloid newspaper expressed an interest in turning her topless debut into a media event. Throughout June and July 1994, it published pictures of McKenzie counting down the days until it could legally show her topless.\n\nAfter she turned 16, McKenzie continued to model topless for the \"Daily Sport\" and the \"Sunday Sport.\" She also made \"Page 3\" girl appearances in tabloid newspapers \"The Sun\" and \"The Daily Star\"; posed topless in lads' mags such as \"Loaded\"; appeared fully nude in British magazines such as \"Mayfair\" and \"Men Only\"; and performed in a variety of softcore videos.\n\nOn 29 July 1995, shortly before her 17th birthday, McKenzie did a topless streak at a televised England v. West Indies cricket match at Old Trafford. Wearing only a thong and a pair of trainers, she ran onto the field with the words \"Only Teasing\" written across her breasts.\n\nAfter McKenzie turned 18 in 1996, she made her North American modelling debut in the breast fetishism magazine \"Score\", which marked the occasion by making McKenzie the cover girl of its December 1996 \"50th Anniversary\" issue.\n\nIn the late 1990s, McKenzie was frequently featured on the adult-oriented channels L!VE TV and Television X.

The episode also featured actress Tina Malone, \"Big Brother\" contestant Spencer Smith and magician Paul Daniels and his wife, Debbie McGee.\n\nAdditionally, McKenzie has appeared in two documentaries about the lives of glamour models, \"The Curse of Page 3\" and \"Girls Behaving Badly.\" She also played the character Beryl Fforbes-Juggs in Martin Gooch's 2002 film \"Arthur's Amazing Things\".\n\nMcKenzie was born in Brent, Middlesex and grew up in Wallington, Surrey. She is the youngest of three children and her parents, Tony and Lesley McKenzie, divorced in 1987. In 1996 McKenzie became involved in an extramarital affair with 27-year-old footballer Dean Holdsworth, who was then a striker for Wimbledon F.C. The relationship received widespread attention in the British media.\n\nIn 1998, she became engaged to actor Michael Greco, who at the time was playing the role of Beppe di Marco in the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\". She twice became pregnant over the course of her 15-month relationship with Greco, but miscarried both times.\n\nMcKenzie began dating 21-year-old window cleaner Terry Canty in 2000. The couple married on 21 April 2001 and Canty performed with McKenzie in her first heterosexual hardcore photoshoots and video. Scenes featuring the couple were released on the 2001 DVD \"Ultimate Linsey.\" The couple separated six weeks after their wedding, and they divorced in 2001.\n\nIn 2004, McKenzie began a relationship with former Wimbledon F.C. and Northern Ireland footballer Mark Williams.

The first series was broadcast on ITV between 6 October 2001 and 9 February 2002. The series saw a series of auditions for aspiring singers, with a final 50 performing in a series of five pre-recorded shows. Two contestants from each show went through to make up a final 10, who performed live in front of a studio audience.\n\nOne contestant who received the least votes from television viewers left the show each week.

She was a favourite of judge Pete Waterman, and made him cry at her initial audition. She signed to Telstar Records after the show, but her debut album was scrapped due to financial difficulties at the company. Ribbons did however release two top 20 singles in the UK. In 2007 she was a semi-finalist in Australian Idol after moving abroad, but failed to make the finals.\n\nRik Waller from Gillingham in Kent was forced to resign from the competition after losing his voice. An early tip to win the show, he was given a bye to the second live show, but with his voice failing to improve he was unable to participate and had to leave. He was replaced by Darius Danesh. After the show ended, he appeared on reality shows Back to Reality and Celebrity Fit Club and released two singles.\n\nWill Young, (aged 22) from Wokingham, Berkshire won the competition.

He is sometimes referred to as Dr. Vogel, although this title was based on an honorary degree, not a Ph.D. Later in his career, he became interested in various theories of quartz crystals and other occult and esoteric fields of study. The Vogel Crystal type cut was created by him.\n\nIt is claimed that Vogel started his research into luminescence while he was still in his teens. This research eventually led him to publish his thesis, \"Luminescence in Liquids and Solids and Their Practical Application\", in collaboration with University of Chicago's Dr. Peter Pringsheim in 1943.\n\nTwo years after the publication, Vogel incorporated his own company, Vogel Luminescence, in San Francisco. For the next decade the firm developed a variety of new products: fluorescent crayons, tags for insecticides, a black light inspection kit to determine the secret trackways of rodents in cellars from their urine and the psychedelic colors popular in \"new age\" posters. In 1957, Vogel Luminescence was sold to Ultra Violet Products and Vogel joined IBM as a full-time research scientist. He retired from IBM in 1984.\n\nHe received 32 patents for his inventions up through his tenure at IBM. Among these was the magnetic coating for the 24\" hard disk drive systems still in use. His areas of expertise, besides luminescence, were phosphor technology, magnetics and liquid crystal systems.\n\nAt Vogel's February 14, 1991 funeral, IBM researcher and Sacramento, California physician Bernard McGinity, M.D. said of him, \"He made his mark because of the brilliance of his mind, his prolific ideas, and his seemingly limitless creativity.\"\n\nAccording to the book \"Light Years\" by Gary Kinder, Vogel examined a metal sample which was allegedly given to Billy Meier by extraterrestrials and marveled at its unusual properties (Vogel stated it contained the element thulium). An investigator with the Independent Investigations Group said the element detected by Vogel was aluminum and not thulium. Kinder however states in his book that the metal sample had disappeared after Vogel's analysis and was never found again.\n\nVogel said he could duplicate the \"Backster effect\" using plants as transducers for bio-energetic fields from the human mind, showing that they respond to human thought. He said his findings had the same effect irrespective of distance and suggested that \"inverse square law does not apply to thought\" (See also: Inverse square law). Vogel was a proponent of research into plant consciousness. He spurred fellow researcher Randall Fontes into furthering this work. Vogel was featured in the first episode of In Search Of... hosted by Leonard Nimoy, called \"Other Voices\". He gave his theories regarding the possibility of communication between plants.\n\n\n"}

Chapman fired five times at Lennon, hitting him four times in the back and later sat down on a nearby curb reading J. D. Salinger's novel \"The Catcher in the Rye\" until he was arrested by the police. He has repeatedly said that the novel was his statement.\n\nChapman's legal team intended to mount an insanity defense that would be based on expert testimony he was in a delusional psychotic state at the time of the killing. As the trial approached, Chapman instructed his lawyers he wanted to plead guilty, based on his assertion of what he had decided was the will of God. After Chapman denied hearing voices, the judge allowed the plea change without further psychiatric assessment and sentenced him to a prison term of 20-years-to life, with a stipulation mental health treatment would be provided. Chapman has been imprisoned ever since, having been denied parole ten times amidst campaigns against his release after he became eligible in 2000.\n\nMark David Chapman was born on May 10, 1955, in Fort Worth, Texas. His father, David Chapman, was a staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force and his mother, Diane (née Pease), was a nurse. His younger sister, Susan, was born seven years later. As a boy, Chapman stated he lived in fear of his father, who he said was physically abusive towards his mother and unloving towards him. Chapman began to fantasize about having king-like power over a group of imaginary \"little people\" who lived in the walls of his bedroom. He attended Columbia High School in Decatur, Georgia. By the time he was fourteen, Chapman was using drugs and skipping classes; he once ran away from home to live on the streets of Atlanta for two weeks. He said he was bullied at school because he was not a good athlete.\n\nIn 1971, Chapman became a born-again Presbyterian and distributed Biblical tracts. He met his first girlfriend, Jessica Blankenship. He began work as a summer camp counselor at the South De Kalb County, Georgia YMCA; he was very popular with the children, who nicknamed him \"Nemo\", and was made assistant director after winning an award for Outstanding Counselor. Those who knew him in the caretaking professions unanimously called him an outstanding worker.\n\nChapman read J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" on the recommendation of a friend. The novel eventually took on great personal significance for him, to the extent he reportedly wished to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield. After graduating from Columbia High School, Chapman moved for a time to Chicago and played guitar in churches and Christian night spots while his friend did impersonations. He worked successfully for World Vision with Vietnamese refugees at a resettlement camp at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas, after a brief visit to Lebanon for the same work. He was named an area coordinator and a key aide to the program director, David Moore, who later said Chapman cared deeply for the children and worked hard. Chapman accompanied Moore to meetings with government officials, and President Gerald Ford shook his hand.\n\nChapman joined Blankenship as a student at Covenant College, an evangelical Presbyterian liberal arts college in Lookout Mountain, Georgia. However, Chapman fell behind in his studies and became obsessed with guilt over having an affair. He started having suicidal thoughts and began to feel like a failure. He dropped out of Covenant College after just one semester and his girlfriend broke off their relationship soon after. Chapman returned to work at the resettlement camp, but left after an argument. He then worked as a security guard, eventually taking a week-long course to qualify as an armed guard. After dropping out of college, Chapman went to Hawaii, where he attempted suicide by carbon monoxide asphyxiation. He connected a hose to his car's exhaust pipe, but the hose melted and the attempt failed. A psychiatrist admitted Chapman to Castle Memorial Hospital for clinical depression. Upon his release, he began working at the hospital. After Chapman's parents began divorce proceedings, his mother joined him in Hawaii.\n\nIn 1978, Chapman went on a six-week trip around the world; the vacation was partly inspired by the film \"Around the World in Eighty Days.\" He visited Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Delhi, Beirut, Geneva, London, Paris and Dublin. He began a relationship with his travel agent, a Japanese American woman named Gloria Abe, whom he married on June 2, 1979. Chapman went to work at Castle Memorial Hospital as a printer, working alone rather than with staff and patients. He was fired by the hospital, rehired, then got into a shouting match with a nurse and quit. Chapman then took a job as a night security guard and began drinking heavily. He developed a series of obsessions, including artwork, \"The Catcher in the Rye\", music and the musician John Lennon. In September 1980, he wrote a letter to a friend, Lynda Irish, in which he stated, \"I'm going nuts.\" He signed the letter, \"The Catcher in the Rye.\" Chapman had no criminal convictions prior to his trip to New York City to kill Lennon. In a letter written from prison, Chapman indicated that he believed he had been forgiven by Jesus for shooting Lennon.\n\nChapman, a Beatles fan who had idolized Lennon, allegedly started planning to kill him three months prior to the murder. Chapman turned against Lennon after making his religious conversion; he was angry about Lennon's well-publicized 1966 comment that Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus.\" Some members of Chapman's prayer group made a joke in reference to Lennon's song \"Imagine\": \"It went, 'Imagine, imagine if John Lennon was dead.'\" Chapman's childhood friend Miles McManushe recalled he referred to the song as \"communist.\" Jan Reeves, the sister of one of Chapman's best friends, reported Chapman \"seemed really angry toward John Lennon and he kept saying he could not understand why John Lennon had said [the Beatles were more popular than Jesus]. According to Mark, there should be nobody more popular than the Lord Jesus Christ. He said it was blasphemy.\"\n\nChapman had also been influenced by reading in a library book, Anthony Fawcett's \"John Lennon: One Day at a Time\", about Lennon's lifestyle in New York. According to his wife Gloria, \"He was angry that Lennon would preach love and peace but yet [sic] have millions [of dollars].\" Chapman later said, \"He told us to imagine no possessions and there he was, with millions of dollars and yachts and farms and country estates, laughing at people like me who had believed the lies and bought the records and built a big part of their lives around his music.\"\n\nChapman said he chose Lennon after seeing him on the cover of the Beatles' album, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" He also recalled having listened to Lennon's \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: \"I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least ten years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who does he think he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this \"The Catcher in the Rye\" milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness.\"\n\nChapman also said he had an alternate hit list of potential targets in mind, including David Bowie, Johnny Carson, Marlon Brando, Walter Cronkite, Elizabeth Taylor, George C. Scott and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, but Lennon seemed to be the easiest to find. He separately said Lennon particularly infatuated him. Chapman's planning has been described as \"muddled.\" He went to New York in October 1980, intending to kill Lennon, but left in order to obtain ammunition from his unwitting friend in Atlanta, Dana Reeves, before returning in November.\n\nAfter being inspired by the film \"Ordinary People\", Chapman returned to Hawaii, telling his wife he had been obsessed with killing Lennon. He showed her the gun and bullets, but she did not inform the police or mental health services. Chapman made an appointment to see a clinical psychologist, but he did not keep the appointment and flew back to New York on December 6, 1980. At one point, he considered ending his life by jumping from the Statue of Liberty. Chapman says the message \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\" flashed on the television at him and was on a wall hanging his wife put up in their apartment. On the night before the murder, Chapman and his wife talked on the phone about getting help with his problems by first working on his relationship with God.\n\nOn the day before the murder, Chapman accosted singer-songwriter James Taylor at the 72nd Street subway station. According to Taylor, \"The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon.\" He also reportedly offered cocaine to a taxi driver. On the day of the murder, Bowie was appearing on Broadway in the play \"The Elephant Man\". \"I was second on his list,\" Bowie later said. \"Chapman had a front-row ticket to \"The Elephant Man\" the next night. John and Yoko were supposed to sit front-row for that show too. So the night after John was killed there were three empty seats in the front row. I can't tell you how difficult that was to go on. I almost didn't make it through the performance.\"\n\nOn December 8, 1980, Chapman left his room at the Sheraton Hotel, leaving personal items behind the police would later find. He bought a copy of \"The Catcher in the Rye\" in which he wrote \"This is my statement\", signing it \"Holden Caulfield.\" He then spent most of the day near the entrance to the Dakota apartment building where Lennon lived, talking to fans and the doorman. Early in the morning, a distracted Chapman missed seeing Lennon step out of a cab and enter the Dakota. Later in the morning, he met Lennon's housekeeper who was returning from a walk with their five-year-old son Sean. Chapman reached in front of the housekeeper to shake Sean's hand and said he was a beautiful boy, quoting Lennon's song \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\".\n\nAround 5:00 p.m., Lennon and Ono left the Dakota for a recording session at Record Plant Studios. As they walked toward their limousine, Chapman shook hands with Lennon and asked for him to sign a copy of his album, \"Double Fantasy.\" Amateur photographer Paul Goresh took a photo of Lennon signing Chapman's album. In a later interview, Chapman said he tried to get Goresh to stay and he asked another Lennon fan who was lingering at the building's entrance to go out with him that night. He suggested if the girl had accepted his invitation or Goresh had stayed, he would not have murdered Lennon that evening, but he probably would have tried another day.\n\nAround 10:50 p.m., Lennon and Ono returned to the Dakota in a limousine. They got out of the vehicle, passed Chapman and walked toward the archway entrance of the building. From the street behind them, Chapman fired five hollow-point bullets from a .38 special revolver, four of which hit Lennon in the back and shoulder, puncturing his left lung and left subclavian artery. At the time, one newspaper reported before Chapman fired, he softly called out \"Mr. Lennon\" and dropped into a combat stance. Chapman said he does not recall saying anything and Lennon did not turn around.\n\nChapman remained at the scene and appeared to be reading \"The Catcher in the Rye\" when the NYPD officers arrived and arrested him without incident. The first responders recognized Lennon's wounds were severe and decided not to wait for an ambulance. They rushed the mortally wounded musician to Roosevelt Hospital in a squad car, but nothing could be done to save him. Lennon was pronounced dead by Dr. Stephan Lynn at 11:07 p.m. In his statement to police three hours later, Chapman stated, \"I'm sure the big part of me is Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the Devil.\"\n\nChapman was charged with second degree murder. He told police he had used hollow-point bullets \"because they are more deadly\" and \"to ensure Lennon's death\". Gloria Chapman, who had known of her husband's preparations for killing Lennon but took no action, was not charged. Chapman later said he harbored a \"deep-seated resentment\" toward his wife, \"that she didn't go to somebody, even the police, and say, 'Look, my husband's bought a gun and he says he's going to kill John Lennon'.\"\n\nMore than a dozen psychologists and psychiatrists interviewed Chapman in the six months prior to his planned trial—three for the prosecution, six for the defense, and several more on behalf of the court. A battery of standard diagnostic procedures and over 200 hours of clinical interviews were conducted. All six defense experts concluded Chapman was psychotic; five diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia, while the sixth felt his symptoms were more consistent with manic depression. The three prosecution experts declared his delusions fell short of psychosis and instead diagnosed various personality disorders. The court-appointed experts concurred with the prosecution's examiners he was delusional, yet competent to stand trial. In the examinations, Chapman was more cooperative with the prosecution's mental health experts than with those for the defense, possibly (according to one psychiatrist) because he did not wish to be considered \"crazy\", and persuaded the defense experts only declared him insane because they were hired to do so.\n\nThe Rev. Charles McGowan, who had been pastor of Chapman's church in Decatur, Georgia, visited Chapman as well, and told him of his conviction that it was religion that held the key to his crime. \"I believe there was a demonic power at work,\" he said. Chapman initially embraced his old religion with new fervor as a result; but after McGowan revealed information to the press Chapman had told him in confidence, Chapman disavowed his renewed interest in Christianity and reverted to his initial explanation: he had killed Lennon to promote the reading of \"The Catcher in the Rye\". When asked why it was so important for people to read the book, Chapman said he \"didn't know\" and \"didn't really care either—that was not his job.\"\n\nChapman's first court-appointed lawyer, Herbert Adlerberg, withdrew from the case amid threats of lynching. Police feared Lennon fans might storm the hospital, so they transferred Chapman to Rikers Island for his personal safety.\n\nAt the initial hearing in January 1981, Chapman's new lawyer, Jonathan Marks, instructed him to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. In February, Chapman sent a handwritten statement to \"The New York Times\" urging everyone to read \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" calling it an \"extraordinary book that holds many answers.\" The defense team sought to establish witnesses as to Chapman's mental state at the time of the killing. It was reported they were confident he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity, in which case he would have been committed to a state mental hospital and received treatment.\n\nHowever, in June, Chapman told Marks he wanted to drop the insanity defense and plead guilty. Marks objected with \"serious questions\" over Chapman's sanity, and legally challenged his competence to make this decision. In the pursuant hearing on June 22, Chapman said God had told him to plead guilty and he would not change his plea or ever appeal, regardless of his sentence. Marks told the court he opposed Chapman's change of plea but Chapman would not listen to him. Judge Dennis Edwards refused a further assessment, saying Chapman had made the decision of his own free will, and declared him competent to plead guilty.\n\nOn August 24, 1981, the sentencing hearing took place. Two experts gave evidence on Chapman's behalf. Judge Edwards interrupted Dorothy Lewis, a research psychiatrist who was relatively inexperienced in the courtroom, indicating the purpose of the hearing was to determine the sentence and there was no question of Chapman's criminal responsibility. Lewis had maintained Chapman's decision to change his plea did not appear reasonable or explicable, and she implied the judge did not want to allow an independent competency assessment. The district attorney argued Chapman committed the murder as an easy route to fame. When Chapman was asked if he had anything to say, he rose and read the passage from \"The Catcher in the Rye\", when Holden tells his little sister, Phoebe, what he wants to do with his life:\n\nI keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.\n\nThe judge ordered psychiatric treatment for Chapman during his incarceration and sentenced him to twenty-years-to-life, five years less than the maximum sentence of twenty-five-years-to-life. Chapman was given five years less than the maximum because he pleaded guilty to second degree murder, thereby avoiding the time and expense of a trial.\n\nIn 1981, Chapman was imprisoned at Attica Correctional Facility outside of Buffalo, New York. After he fasted for twenty six days in February 1982, the New York State Supreme Court authorized the state to force feed him. Martin Von Holden, the director of the Central New York Psychiatric Center, said Chapman still refused to eat with other inmates but agreed to take liquid nutrients. Chapman was confined to a special handling unit (SHU) for violent and at-risk prisoners, in part due to concern he may be harmed by Lennon's fans in the general population. There were 105 prisoners in the building who were \"not considered a threat to him,\" according to the New York State Department of Correctional Services. He had his own prison cell, but spent \"most of his day outside his cell working on housekeeping and in the library.\"\n\nChapman worked in the prison as a legal clerk and kitchen helper. He was barred from participating in the Cephas Attica workshops, a charitable organization helping inmates adjust to life outside prison. He was also prohibited from attending the prison's violence and anger management classes due to concern for his safety. Chapman reportedly enjoys reading and writing short stories. At his parole board hearing in 2004, he described his plans; \"I would immediately try to find a job, and I really want to go from place to place, at least in the state, church to church, and tell people what happened to me and point them the way to Christ.\" He also said he thought there was a possibility he could find work as a farmhand or return to his previous trade as a printer.\n\nChapman is in the Family Reunion Program, and is allowed one conjugal visit a year with his wife, since he accepted solitary confinement. The program allows him to spend up to forty-eight hours alone with his wife in a specially built prison home. He also gets occasional visits from his sister, clergy, and a few friends. In 2004, James Flateau, a spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services, said Chapman had been involved in three \"minor incidents\" between 1989 and 1994 for delaying an inmate count and refusing to follow an order. On May 15, 2012, Chapman was transferred to the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York, which is east of Buffalo.\n\nChapman first became eligible for parole in 2000. Under New York state law, he is required to have a parole hearing every two years from that year onwards. Since that time, a three-member board has denied Chapman parole ten times. Shortly before Chapman's first hearing, Yoko Ono sent a letter to the board opposing his release from prison. In addition, New York State Senator Michael Nozzolio, chairman of the Senate Crime Victims, Crime and Correction Committee, wrote to Parole Board Chairman Brion Travis saying: \"It is the responsibility of the New York State Parole Board to ensure that public safety is protected from the release of dangerous criminals like Chapman.\"\n\n\nChapman refused all requests for interviews following the murder and during his first six years at Attica. James R. Gaines interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word \"People\" magazine series in February and March 1987. Chapman told the parole board he regretted the interview. He later gave a series of audio-taped interviews to Jack Jones of the Rochester \"Democrat and Chronicle.\" In 1992, Jones published a book, \"Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon\".\n\nAlso in 1992, Chapman gave two television interviews. On December 4, 1992, ABC's \"20/20\" aired an interview he gave to Barbara Walters, his first television interview since the shooting. On December 17, 1992, Larry King interviewed Chapman on his CNN program \"Larry King Live\". In 2000, with his first parole hearing approaching, Jones asked Chapman to tell his story for \"Mugshots\", a CourtTV program. Chapman refused to go on camera but, after praying over it, consented to tell his story in a series of audiotapes.\n\nChapman's experiences during the weekend on which he committed the murder have been turned into a feature-length movie called \"Chapter 27\", in which he is played by Jared Leto. The film was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer and is based on Jones' book. The film's title is a reference to \"The Catcher in the Rye\", which has 26 chapters. \"Chapter 27\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2007, and had a limited release in U.S. theaters in March 2008. \"Chapter 27\" was released widely onto DVD on September 30, 2008. Another film, entitled \"The Killing of John Lennon\" starring Jonas Ball as Chapman, documents Chapman's life before and up to the murder. The film features Ball as Chapman narrating the film and states that all the words are Chapman's own.\n\nA number of conspiracy theories have been published, based on CIA and FBI surveillance of Lennon due to his left-wing activism, and on the actions of Chapman in the murder or subsequent legal proceedings. Barrister and journalist Fenton Bresler raised the idea in a book published in 1990. Liverpool playwright Ian Carroll, who has staged a drama conveying the theory Chapman was manipulated by a rogue wing of the CIA, suggests he was not so insane he could not manage a long trip from Hawaii to New York shortly prior to the murder. Claims include Chapman was a \"Manchurian candidate\", including speculation on links to the CIA's Project MKULTRA. At least one author has argued forensic evidence proves Chapman did not commit the murder.\n\nIn 1982, Rhino Records released a compilation of Beatles-related novelty and parody songs, called \"Beatlesongs\". It featured a cover caricature of Chapman by William Stout. Following its release, Rhino recalled the record and replaced it with another cover. New York-based band Mindless Self Indulgence released a track entitled \"Mark David Chapman\" on their album \"If\". Irish band the Cranberries recorded a song called \"I Just Shot John Lennon\" for their 1996 album \"To the Faithful Departed\", citing events that took place outside the Dakota on the night of Lennon's murder. The title of the song comes from Chapman's own words.\n\nAustin, Texas-based art rock band ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead have also released a song called \"Mark David Chapman\" from their 1999 album \"Madonna\". Julian Cope's 1988 album \"Autogeddon\" contains a song called \"Don't Call Me Mark Chapman\" whose lyrics suggest it is told from the point of view of Lennon's murderer. Filipino band Rivermaya released a song called \"Hangman (I Shot the Walrus)\" on their album \"Atomic Bomb\" (1997), supposedly written from Chapman's point of view.\n\nChapman's obsession with the central character and message of \"The Catcher in the Rye\" added to controversy about the novel. Some links have been drawn between Chapman and the book's themes of adolescent sensitivity and depression on the one hand, and anti-social and violent thoughts on the other. This connection was made in the play \"Six Degrees of Separation\" and its film adaptation by the character played by Will Smith.\n\nLinks have sometimes been drawn between Chapman's actions and those of other killers or attempted killers. After John Hinckley tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan - less than four months after Lennon's murder - police found a copy of \"Catcher in the Rye\" among his personal belongings. It has been said that Hinckley mourned Lennon's death. Furthermore, Hinckley's father, John Hinckley, Sr, was president of World Vision, for whom Chapman was employed. A writer who experienced mental illness in the same city as Jared Loughner has suggested examples such as Chapman's show the need to challenge stigma about mental health problems and ensure there are good community mental health services including crisis intervention.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24938723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24938723", "title": "Otto Moll", "text": "Otto Moll\n\nOtto Hermann Wilhelm Moll was an \"SS-Hauptscharführer\" and part of the staff at Auschwitz. Born in Hohen Schönberg, Germany on March 4, 1915 and was executed on May 28, 1946 in Landsberg am Lech.\n\nMoll joined the SS on May 1, 1935 (serial number 277670). He held various posts during his tenure at Auschwitz. A gardener by trade, from May 1941 until January 1945 Moll was Kommandoführer of the gardeners work detail, director of the employment service in the men's camp, head of the crematoria in Birkenau, Lagerführer of the Fürstengrube subcamp in Wesola near Myslowice and of the Gleiwitz 1 sub-camp in Gliwice.\n\nIn May 1941, Otto Moll was transferred from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp to Birkenau where he was put in charge of digging the mass graves. From 1943 to the evacuation of the camp, Moll was chief of the crematoria. Alter Feinsilber, a member of the Sonderkommando at Birkenau who worked under Otto Moll's supervision, mentioned Moll in his testimony for the prosecution in a Kraków court:\n\nIt happened that some prisoners offered resistance when about to be shot at the pit or that children would cry and then SS Quartermaster Sergeant Moll would throw them alive into the flames of the pit.\n\nAccording to the former Sonderkommando prisoner Henryk Tauber:\n\nHauptscharführer Moll was the most degenerate of the lot. Before his arrival at the camp, he was in charge of the work at the Bunkers, where they incinerated the gassed victims in pits. Then he was transferred for a while to another section. In view of the preparation necessary for the \"reception\" of convoys from Hungary in 1944, he was put in charge of all the crematoria. It is he who organized the large-scale extermination of the people arriving in these convoys. Just before the arrival of the Hungarian transports, he ordered pits to be dug alongside crematoria V and restarted the activity of Bunker 2, which had been lying idle, and its pits. In the yard of the crematory, there were notices on posts, with inscriptions telling the new arrivals from the transports that they were to go to the camp where work was waiting for them, but that first they had to take a bath and undergo disinfestation. For that, it was necessary for them to undress and put all their valuables in baskets specially placed for this purpose in the yard. Moll repeated the same thing in his speeches to the new arrivals. There were so many convoys that sometimes it happened that the gas chambers were incapable of containing all the new arrivals. The excess people were generally shot, one at a time and often by Moll himself. On several occasions, Moll threw people into the flaming pits alive. He also practised shooting people from a distance. He ill-treated and beat Sonderkommando prisoners, treating them like animals. Those who were in his personal service told us that he used a piece of wire to fish out gold objects from the box containing the jewels taken from new arrivals, and took them off in a briefcase. Among the objects left by the people who came to be gassed, he took furs and different types of food, in particular fat. When he took food, he said smilingly to the SS around him that one had to take advantage before the lean years came. Under his direction, the Sonderkommando was strengthened and increased to about 1000 prisoners.\n\nSS Hauptscharführer Otto Moll is said to have personally killed thousands of innocent victims (over 20 thousand according to some reports) during his time at Auschwitz-Birkenau. According to the infamous Auschwitz Kommandant Rudolf Höss, he and Sergeant Major Moll were both decorated by the Führer with the Cross of Merit, First Class, with Swords. Whether or not this is true has yet to be proven.\n\nOtto Moll was transferred to a sub-camp of Dachau after Auschwitz-Birkenau was abandoned by the SS on January 18, 1945. On April 28, 1945, one day before the Dachau camp was liberated by American soldiers, Moll arrived at the main camp, along with a group of prisoners that he had led on an evacuation \"death march.\" Moll was put on trial by an American Military Tribunal at Dachau in November 1945. He was charged with not allowing the prisoners to escape from the death march, which was a war crime, according to the Allies. He was executed on May 28, 1946 at the Landsberg am Lech prison.\n\nMoll appears several times in the photo album of Karl-Friedrich Höcker of camp staff at a retreat.\n\nHe always said to his man: \"\"Befehl ist Befehl\"!\" (\"An order is an order!\"). This famous quote was made by scores of Nazis regardless of their rank when trying to justify or excuse themselves for their behavior. Unsurprisingly, these words were spoken at one time or another by a number of defendants at the Nuremberg Tribunal.\n\n"}

A former member of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and then later the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), Hancock was excommunicated from the Temple Lot church in 1946, due to differences between her view of the Godhead and theirs. She later claimed a vision of Jesus Christ, whom she claimed had told her to \"go and teach,\" leading her to found her own church in 1946. She would lead this church until her death in 1962.\n\nPauline Hancock was a member of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now called the Community of Christ), whose father had been a minister of that denomination in Salt Lake City, Utah. During the Supreme Directional Control controversy of the 1920s, she opposed President Frederick M. Smith's attempt to take \"supreme directional control\" over the RLDS church; she later transferred her membership to the Church of Christ (Temple Lot). In 1935, following the excommunication of her friend Apostle Samuel Wood of the Temple Lot church (who was expelled for believing in a modalistic view of the Godhead, a view Hancock supported), Hancock resigned from that organization.\n\nHancock later claimed to have had a vision in which God told her to \"go and teach others.\" Her account of this vision is as follows:\n\n\"I was reading in our living room, when all of a sudden I saw a marvelous vision. It seemed that I was taken to Jerusalem and I saw a man seated upon what looked like a stool. All around and about him, men were mocking, bowing and making fun of this individual... I continued to watch as he was condemned to death and a crown of thorns was placed on his head... I knew that there was nothing good in me except God had put it there... I knew I had to have this Jesus or die... I fell upon my knees and prayed to God through Jesus and His shed blood, to be forgiven of my sins... When my prayer was finished, God baptized me with His own spirit and my soul was on fire with love towards God and mankind - I became a new creature...\n\nGod spoke to me then and said: 'Now go and teach all people what I have shown you - for I am the way.' I answered Him that I couldn't do that and He said, 'I will be with you.' I said, 'I am a woman and they won't receive me.' He said, 'I wasn't a woman and they didn't receive me - go teach and I'll be with you.'\n\nBlessed by the name of God. Yes, He calls women. He called me\".\n\nHancock subsequently founded her own organization to propagate her teachings and visions, which included one of Jesus being crucified that led her to believe she had become \"a new creature\". Hancock's organization rejected the Doctrine and Covenants of their parent church, as well as the Pearl of Great Price used by the LDS Church, retaining only the King James Bible and the Book of Mormon. She adopted a modalistic view of God, insisting that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit were merely manifestation of the same, one God. The organization bought property in Independence and built a submerged sanctuary that became locally known as the \"basement church\" because most of it was underground. \n\nHancock exercised functions normally reserved solely to men during this time in Latter Day Saint history, such as performing baptisms and administering other ordinances, as well as preaching. She did not claim any formal title, but remained the undisputed leader of her church from its founding until the time of her death.\n\nHancock died in 1962, still accepting the Book of Mormon as a valid work of scripture. However, following her death members of her church, including Jerald and Sandra Tanner, began to question the authenticity of the Book of Mormon, which led to Hancock's church rejecting it in 1973. Her church continued to function for a time strictly as a Protestant denomination, but later chose to dissolve itself in 1984, after which its members mostly joined with various Evangelical Protestant churches. Hancock's \"basement church\" was used by a Protestant church for a time, but was later sold to a local Restoration Branch, which constructed an above-ground sanctuary atop the old structure.\n\n"}

Starting out as a captain under the command of Petar Dobrnjac, Paulj was elevated to \"vojvoda\" (general) in the Gornja Mlava region upon showing his courage. He took part in the successful campaigns in the eastern parts of the Belgrade Pashaluk, and the campaign to take Niš (1809).\n\nHe was born in the village of Melnica, at that time part of the Požarevac \"nahiya\" in the Sanjak of Smederevo (\"Belgrade Pashaluk\").\n\nHe became a \"buljubaša\" (captain) already by the beginning of the uprising, appointed by Petar Dobrnjac. For his courage and other great traits, he was later appointed \"vojvoda\" (general) in Gornja Mlava. Paulj participated in the victories in the eastern parts of the Belgrade Pashaluk that strengthened rebel holding.\n\nA rebel army led by commanders Miloje Petrović, Petar Dobrnjac, Ilija Barjaktarević, Paulj Matejić, Stevan Sinđelić and Veljko Petrović arrived on 1809 outside Niš. During preparations for the takeover of Niš, Paulj made a trench above the village of Kamenica. The trench, above the church, had two cannons. It was one of eleven or twelve rebel trenches around the city. On , when the Ottomans rushed on the Čegar hill defended by Stevan Sinđelić, and \"vojvoda\" Miloje did not let anybody aid them, Paulj decided against the command and went for Čegar. Paulj did not reach in time; when the Ottomans had surrounded and overtook Sinđelić's trench, he decided to blow up the gunpowder magazine and kill everyone on the hill. Paulj and his small unit were defeated and forced to retreat, as others, to Deligrad. He mostly stayed in Deligrad after this. The Serbian Ruling Council appointed Paulj the first permanent commander of Gurgusovac (Knjaževac) after the Treaty of Bucharest (1812).\n\nIn the 1812–13 \"Protocol\" of Karađorđe, there are ten numbers written for Paulj. In 1813, he fled to the Habsburg Monarchy, while the Austrians sent him to stay in Leoben for a time. He returned to Serbia in 1815, and died in his home village.\n\nHe begged for the hand of the daughter of Momir of Lučica for his son Budimir, and they married.\n\nThere is a Serbian cultural association named after him. A statue of his was erected in his home village Melnica in 2004. A water mill in his ownership is today a recognized cultural monument.\n\n"}

In the ancient times, the \"Saddang\" river flowing in Rappang was quite wide and had great torrent with a dense wood in the upstream. When the rainy season had arrived, the branches of the trees were washed away and formed the mainland, became a place of settlement and later was named \"Rappang\".\n\nHistorically, there were two kingdoms, one was Sidenreng kingdom and another one was Rappang. Both kingdoms were very intimate, so it is hard to find clear demarcation. Even in matters of royal reigns, both could co-exist. Many Times, the tribal chief of Sidenreng took the seat of the Rappang kingdom and vice versa. People in two kingdoms used the same dialect and daily conversational language was also similar.

Later in life he became a computer security consultant, speaking at many conferences on information security and training banks, large companies and universities in the UK on IT security. In 2014 he began developing the software on which SecuritySmart runs from scratch which reached completion and product launch in June 2016.\n\nThe idea of SecuritySmart.co.uk came to Robert after speaking to many CISOs at conferences and repeatedly hearing that the biggest problem with traditional methods of IT security training was that they lacked any tangible way of measuring success. SecuritySmart is a micro-learning platform which sends an email a week to trainees on one security-related topic, ending in a multiple choice question to test trainee understanding. Managers have access to a dashboard that contains analytics related to trainee response to the training emails, including when they were opened, how long they took to answer the question and how regularly they got the answers right.\n\nHe was arrested in 1985 for hacking into a British Telecom computer and accessing the Telecom Gold emails of Prince Philip. As there was no specific law against hacking at this time, in June 1985 he became (together with his co-defendant, Steve Gold) one of the first two people to be charged under section 1 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 with forgery which deceived a non-human target. When the case came to trial in April 1986, Schifreen was said to have used an unprotected top level account identified as \"2222222222\" with a password of \"1234\"; Schifreen was said to have admitted obtaining user passwords but denied doing so for personal gain and said that his activities prompted Prestel to increase security. On 24 April 1986 Schifreen was convicted on six counts of forgery and fined £750.\n\nSchifreen's appeal to the Court of Appeal was heard by three judges including the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane; judgment was given on 21 July 1987, and found that the use of a charge of forgery was inappropriate and that an application that the charges should be dismissed as giving no case to answer should succeed. The judgment expressed the hope that \"the Procrustean attempt to force the facts into the language of an Act not designed to fit them\" would not be repeated.\n\nThe Crown then appealed to the House of Lords, but the appeal was turned down in April 1988. The Law Lords agreed that the \"making of a false instrument\", a key part of proving a forgery case, revolved around the production of a \"memory segment\" with false information; as the computer had created this rather than Schifreen himself, the computer had effectively \"forged itself\". This case led to introduction of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.\n\nAfter his acquittal, Schifreen had to take a judicial review action against the police for the return of his computers. For some years, Schifreen was the editor of \".EXE Magazine\", a magazine for programmers. 'hex', his online name (shortened from the punning 'hex maniac'), was an active CIXen from the late 1980s, at a time when online communities were still a rare novelty.\n\nSchifreen now lives in East Sussex working as an IT security trainer and web developer at the University of Brighton and runs an IT security consultancy. He regularly speaks at conferences and writes articles for the computer press and other publications. In 2006, John Wiley & Sons published his book, \"Defeating the Hacker\".\n"}

{"id": "872991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=872991", "title": "Serge Lang", "text": "Serge Lang\n\nSerge Lang (; May 19, 1927 – September 12, 2005) was a French-American mathematician and activist. He is known for his work in number theory and for his mathematics textbooks, including the influential \"Algebra\". He was a member of the Bourbaki group. At the time of his death he was professor emeritus of mathematics at Yale University.\n\nSerge Lang was born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye close to Paris in 1927. Serge had a twin brother who became a basketball coach and a sister who became an actress.\n\nLang moved with his family to California as a teenager, where he graduated in 1943 from Beverly Hills High School. He subsequently graduated from the California Institute of Technology in 1946, and received a doctorate from Princeton University in 1951. He held faculty positions at the University of Chicago, Columbia University (from 1955, leaving in 1971 in a dispute), and Yale University.\n\nLang studied under Emil Artin at Princeton University, writing his thesis on quasi-algebraic closure. Lang then worked on the geometric analogues of class field theory and diophantine geometry. Later he moved into diophantine approximation and transcendental number theory, proving the Schneider–Lang theorem.\n\nA break in research while he was involved in trying to meet 1960s student activism halfway caused him (by his own description) difficulties in picking up the threads afterwards. He wrote on modular forms and modular units, the idea of a 'distribution' on a profinite group, and value distribution theory.\n\nHe made a number of conjectures in diophantine geometry: Mordell–Lang conjecture, Bombieri–Lang conjecture, Lang's integral point conjecture, Lang–Trotter conjecture, Lang conjecture on Gamma values, Lang conjecture on analytically hyperbolic varieties, Lang's height conjecture ...\n\nHe introduced the Lang map and the Lang–Steinberg theorem (cf. Lang's theorem) in algebraic groups.\n\nHe introduced the Katz–Lang finiteness theorem.\n\nHe was a prolific writer of mathematical texts, often completing one on his summer vacation. Most are at the graduate level.\nHe wrote calculus texts and also prepared a book on group cohomology for Bourbaki.\n\nLang's \"Algebra\", a graduate-level introduction to abstract algebra, was a highly influential text that ran through numerous updated editions. His Steele prize citation stated, \"Lang's \"Algebra\" changed the way graduate algebra is taught...It has affected all subsequent graduate-level algebra books.\" It contained ideas of his teacher, Artin; some of the most interesting passages in \"Algebraic Number Theory\" also reflect Artin's influence and ideas that might otherwise not have been published in that or any form.\n\nLang was noted for his eagerness for contact with students. Many of his students at Yale considered him to be one of the greatest teachers of mathematics in the world. He won a Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (1999) from the American Mathematical Society. In 1960, he won the sixth Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Algebra for his paper \"Unramified class field theory over function fields in several variables\" (Annals of Mathematics, Series 2, volume 64 (1956), pp. 285–325).\n\nLang spent much of his professional time engaged in political activism. He was a staunch socialist and active in opposition to the Vietnam War, volunteering for the 1966 anti-war campaign of Robert Scheer (the subject of his book \"The Scheer Campaign\"). Lang later quit his position at Columbia in 1971 in protest over the university's treatment of anti-war protesters.\n\nLang engaged in several efforts to challenge anyone he believed was spreading misinformation or misusing science or mathematics to further their own goals. He attacked the 1977 Survey of the American Professoriate, an opinion questionnaire that Seymour Martin Lipset and E. C. Ladd had sent to thousands of college professors in the United States, accusing it of containing numerous biased and loaded questions. This led to a public and highly acrimonious conflict.\n\nIn 1986, Lang mounted what the \"New York Times\" described as a \"one-man challenge\" against the nomination of political scientist Samuel P. Huntington to the National Academy of Sciences. Lang described Huntington's research, in particular his use of mathematical equations to demonstrate that South Africa was a \"satisfied society\", as \"pseudoscience\", arguing that it gave \"the illusion of science without any of its substance.\" Despite support for Huntington from the Academy's social and behavioral scientists, Lang's challenge was successful, and Huntington was twice rejected for Academy membership. Huntington's supporters argued that Lang's opposition was political rather than scientific in nature.\n\nLang kept his political correspondence and related documentation in extensive \"files\". He would send letters or publish articles, wait for responses, engage the writers in further correspondence, collect all these writings together and point out what he considered contradictions. He often mailed these files to people he considered important; some of them were also published in his books \"Challenges\" () and \"The File\" (). His extensive file criticizing Nobel laureate David Baltimore was published in the journal \"Ethics and Behaviour\" in January 1993. Lang fought the decision by Yale University to hire Daniel Kevles, a historian of science, because Lang disagreed with Kevles' analysis in \"The Baltimore Case\".\n\nLang's most controversial political stance was as an AIDS denialist; he maintained that the prevailing scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS has not been backed up by reliable scientific research, yet for political and commercial reasons further research questioning the current point of view is suppressed. In public he was very outspoken about this point and a portion of \"Challenges\" is devoted to this issue.\n\n\n"}

She was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, with no prospect of parole after being convicted of killing two men, Kenneth Countie and Michael DeLoge, in Epping, New Hampshire. At the time of the crimes, LaBarre lived in Epping, New Hampshire (Rockingham County) on a farm.\n\nShe regularly enticed younger men to her farm, where she would torture and control them.\n\nAt her trial she claimed she was an angel, sent by God to punish pedophiles. She accused the two men she killed of being pedophiles.\n\nLaBarre was born Sheila Kaye Bailey in Alabama in 1958. She has a sister, Lynn Noojin. She graduated from Fort Payne High School in 1976.\n\nAfter marrying Ronnie Jennings, she was known as Sheila Bailey Jennings. She wanted to divorce Ronnie but he refused to divorce her for some time. In the early 1980s, LaBarre was held in a psychiatric facility after attempting suicide; at the facility she was sexually assaulted by an orderly.\n\nShe married John Baxter in January 1981.\n\nLaBarre moved from Fort Payne to Epping, New Hampshire in 1987 after answering a personal ad placed by Dr. Wilfred \"Bill\" LaBarre, a chiropractor. She never legally married Bill LaBarre, but took his last name (\"Sheila LaBarre\") and they lived together from 1987 until his death at age 74 in 2000. Bill LaBarre had been married twice before. However, LaBarre married a Jamaican citizen named Wayne Ennis in York, Maine, on August 22, 1995. LaBarre divorced Ennis in 1996. In April 1997, Sheila LaBarre got a restraining order against Ennis after he had repeatedly assaulted her.\n\nAfter Bill's death, Sheila LaBarre inherited his farm. She said she was his common-law wife. His children from a previous relationship attempted to contest the will to get money and property, but were informed they had a 50/50 chance of success and would have to pay $50,000 upfront. After LaBarre's arrest there was speculation that she may have killed Bill, an allegation which LaBarre has denied.\n\nKenny Countie met LaBarre via a personal ad in 2006 when he was 24. He moved in with her shortly after meeting her. Countie was described as having a low IQ and \"child like\" trust. LaBarre made a recording of him vomiting whilst she accused him of being a paedophile. She stabbed him to death and then burnt his body. The police were able to identify his DNA from his army records.\n\nCountie's mother subsequently accused the Epping Police Department of negligence. Prior to his death, he had been seen in a Walmart store, bruised and burned, in a wheelchair. Her lawsuit against the two police officers who had seen him in the store was rejected in 2010.\n\nDeloge was LaBarre's boyfriend, who lived with her at her farm. He was last seen alive in 2005. A bone of his and his birth certificate were found at the farm in 2008. It is unknown how he died. His mother informed the police that she was worried LaBarre was trying to kill him.\n\nAn arrest warrant was issued on April 1, 2006 for Shelia LaBarre, for charges of first degree murder. She was arrested on April 2, and the police conducted a three-week search of her farm, which led to the discovery of three human toes which forensic analysis determined did not belong to either Kenny Countie or Michael Deloge.\n\nThe jury visited LaBarre's farm and the Walmart where she was seen with Countie. LaBarre attended too, wearing a stun belt.\n\nLaBarre pleaded not guilty to murdering Countie and Deloge on the grounds of insanity. Her defense attorney described her as a \"deeply, deeply sick individual\".\n\nAt trial in May 2008, psychiatrists testified that LaBarre was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder.\n\nJames Brackett testified in court that he was in an abusive relationship with LaBarre for six years.\n\nLaBarre's ex-husband Wayne Ennis claimed that she had asked him to kill Wilfred.\n\nWilfred LaBarre's daughter Laura Melisi claimed that LaBarre had threatened to shoot people. She stated she always disliked Sheila LaBarre, and had warned her father against pursuing a relationship.\n\nHer plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was rejected by the jury. They found her guilty and LaBarre was sentenced to life in prison without parole in June 2008.\n\nHer appeal in 2010 was rejected. LaBarre is currently serving her sentence at Homestead Correctional Institution, in Florida City, Florida.\n"}

This was an organisation that produced concert performances of operas rather than staged productions because they were less expensive for the audiences. For their first performance they persuaded Colin Davis, at the time a 22-year-old clarinetist, to conduct a concert performance of Mozart’s \"Don Giovanni\" in the Holywell Music Room, Oxford. Gray played in the orchestra, and Cairns sang the role of Leporello.\n\nIn 1957 the London Philharmonic Orchestra invited Gray to leave his career at the Bank of England to assist with managing its finances. Two years later Gray joined the Philharmonia Orchestra as an administrator. In 1964 he moved to Liverpool to become the manager of the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, a post he held until his retirement in 1987. During this time, the orchestra had five principal conductors, Sir Charles Groves (until 1977), Walter Weller (1977–80), David Atherton (1980–83), Marek Janowski (1983–87), and Libor Pešek (1987–97). Together with Sir Charles, Gray organised an annual conductors' seminar, in which young potential conductors worked with the orchestra for a fortnight. In 1972 Gray noticed the potential of Simon Rattle when, at the age of 17, he conducted the Merseyside Youth Orchestra in a performance of \"The Rite of Spring\". Gray appointed Rattle as an associate conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra in 1977. When Gray retired in 1987, a concert was organised in which each of the five principal conductors, and Simon Rattle, took part. Following his retirement, Gray remained active, helping to the rescue the Bluecoat Society of Arts, who were based in the Bluecoat Chambers in Liverpool, from closure.\n\nStephen Gray was born in Guildford, Surrey, England, and was the son of an Anglican clergyman. He was educated at Rugby School, where he took an active part in the school orchestra. After leaving school he worked at Bletchley Park, but he never disclosed what he did there. He studied classics at Trinity College, Oxford, then joined the Bank of England as a trainee. Gray married Frances, a member of the chorus of the Chelsea Opera Group, in 1953. Together they had a son and a daughter. Gray was appointed OBE in 1987.\n"}
{"id": "351873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=351873", "title": "Theresa May", "text": "Theresa May\n\nTheresa Mary May (; ; born 1 October 1956) is a British politician serving as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party since 2016. She served as Home Secretary from 2010 to 2016. May was first elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidenhead in 1997. Ideologically, she identifies herself as a one-nation conservative.\n\nMay grew up in Oxfordshire and attended St Hugh's College, Oxford. From 1977 until 1983, she worked for the Bank of England, and from 1985 until 1997 at the Association for Payment Clearing Services, also serving as a councillor for Durnsford in Merton. After unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the House of Commons in 1992 and 1994, she was elected as the MP for Maidenhead in the 1997 general election. From 1999 to 2010, May held a number of roles in the Shadow Cabinets of William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard, and David Cameron, including Shadow Transport Secretary and Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary. She was also Chairman of the Conservative Party from 2002 to 2003.\n\nAfter the formation of a coalition government following the 2010 general election, May was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities, giving up the latter role in 2012. Reappointed after the Conservative victory in the 2015 general election, she went on to become the longest-serving Home Secretary in over 60 years. During her tenure she pursued reform of the Police Federation, implemented a harder line on drugs policy including the banning of khat, oversaw the introduction of elected Police and Crime Commissioners, the deportation of Abu Qatada, the creation of the National Crime Agency and brought in additional restrictions on immigration.\n\nFollowing Cameron's resignation, May won a leadership election in July 2016, becoming the second female Prime Minister, following Margaret Thatcher. As Prime Minister, May began the process of withdrawing the UK from the European Union, triggering Article 50 in March 2017 then, the following month, announcing a snap general election in June, with the aim of strengthening her hand in Brexit negotiations. This resulted in a hung parliament, in which the number of Conservative seats fell from 330 to 317, despite the party winning their highest vote share since 1983, prompting her to broker a confidence and supply deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to support a minority government. May is currently orchestrating the Brexit negotiations with the European Union, adhering to the Chequers Agreement, agreed in 2018.\n\nBorn on 1 October 1956 in Eastbourne, Sussex, May is the only child of Zaidee Mary (née Barnes; 1928–1982) and Hubert Brasier (1917–1981). Her father was a Church of England clergyman (and an Anglo-Catholic) who was chaplain of an Eastbourne hospital. He later became vicar of Enstone with Heythrop and finally of St Mary's at Wheatley, to the east of Oxford. May's mother was a strong supporter of the Conservative Party.\n\nShe initially attended Heythrop Primary School, a state school in Heythrop, followed by St. Juliana's Convent School for Girls, a Roman Catholic independent school in Begbroke, which closed in 1984.\n\nWhen she was 13, May won a place at the former Holton Park Girls' Grammar School, a state school in Wheatley. During her time as a pupil, the Oxfordshire education system was reorganised and the school became the new Wheatley Park Comprehensive School. May later attended the University of Oxford where she read geography at St Hugh's College, graduating with a second class BA degree in 1977.\n\nBetween 1977 and 1983 May worked at the Bank of England, and from 1985 to 1997 as a financial consultant and senior advisor in International Affairs at the Association for Payment Clearing Services. She married Philip May in September 1980. Her father died in a car accident in 1981 and her mother of multiple sclerosis the following year. May later stated she was \"sorry they [her parents] never saw me elected as a Member of Parliament\".\n\nMay served as a councillor for Durnsford ward on the London Borough of Merton from 1986 to 1994, where she was Chairman of Education (1988–90) and Deputy Group Leader and Housing Spokesman (1992–94). In the 1992 general election May stood unsuccessfully for the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, coming second to incumbent MP Hilary Armstrong by 12,747 votes (27.6%) to 26,734 (57.8%), with future Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron coming third. May then stood at the 1994 Barking by-election, which was prompted by the death of Labour MP Jo Richardson. The seat had been continuously held by Labour since it was created in 1945 and Labour candidate Margaret Hodge was expected to win easily, which she did, with 13,704 votes (72.1%). May came a distant third with 1,976 votes (10.4%). Ahead of the 1997 general election, May was selected as the Conservative candidate for Maidenhead, a new seat which was created from parts of the seats of Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham. She was elected with 25,344 votes (49.8%), almost double the total of second-placed Andrew Terence Ketteringham of the Liberal Democrats, who took 13,363 votes (26.3%).\n\nHaving entered Parliament, May became a member of William Hague's front-bench Opposition team, as Shadow Spokesman for Schools, Disabled People and Women (1998–1999). She became the first of the 1997 MPs to enter the Shadow Cabinet when in 1999 she was appointed Shadow Education and Employment Secretary. After the 2001 election the new Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith kept her in the Shadow Cabinet, moving her to the Transport portfolio.\n\nMay was appointed the first female Chairman of the Conservative Party in July 2002. During her speech at the 2002 Conservative Party Conference, she explained why, in her view, her party must change: \"You know what people call us? The Nasty Party\". In 2003, she was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Transport after Michael Howard's election as Conservative Party and Opposition Leader in November that year.\n\nIn June 2004 she was moved to become Shadow Secretary of State for the Family. Following the 2005 general election she was also made Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. David Cameron appointed her Shadow Leader of the House of Commons in December 2005 after his accession to the leadership. In January 2009, May was made Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.\n\nOn 6 May 2010, May was re-elected MP for Maidenhead with an increased majority of 16,76960% of the vote. This followed an earlier failed attempt to unseat her in 2005 as one of the Liberal Democrats' leading \"decapitation-strategy\" targets.\n\nOn 12 May 2010, when May was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equality by Prime Minister David Cameron as part of his first Cabinet, she became the fourth woman to hold one of the British Great Offices of State, after Margaret Thatcher (Prime Minister), Margaret Beckett (Foreign Secretary) and Jacqui Smith (Home Secretary). As Home Secretary, May was also a member of the National Security Council. She was the longest-serving Home Secretary for over 60 years, since James Chuter Ede who served over six years and two months from August 1945 to October 1951. May's appointment as Home Secretary was somewhat unexpected, with Chris Grayling having served as shadow Home Secretary in opposition.\n\nMay's debut as Home Secretary involved overturning several of the previous Labour government's measures on data collection and surveillance in England and Wales. By way of a government bill which became the Identity Documents Act 2010, she brought about the abolition of the Labour government's National Identity Card and database scheme and reformed the regulations on the retention of DNA samples for suspects and controls on the use of CCTV cameras. In May 2010, May announced the adjournment of the deportation to the United States of alleged computer hacker Gary McKinnon. She also suspended the registration scheme for carers of children and vulnerable people, with May saying that the measures were \"draconian. You were assumed to be guilty until you were proven innocent, and told you were able to work with children.\" On 4 August 2010, it was reported that May was scrapping the former Labour government's proposed \"go orders\" scheme to protect women from domestic violence by banning abusers from the victim's home.\n\nIn June 2010, May faced her first major national security incident as Home Secretary with the Cumbria shootings. She delivered her first major speech in the House of Commons as Home Secretary in a statement on this incident, later visiting the victims with the Prime Minister. Also in June 2010, May banned the Indian Muslim preacher Zakir Naik from entering the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to \"The Daily Telegraph\", a Home Office official who disagreed with this decision was suspended. In late June 2010, May announced plans for a temporary cap on UK visas for non-EU migrants. The move raised concerns about the impact on the British economy.\n\nIn August 2013, May supported the detention of David Miranda, partner of \"Guardian\" journalist Glenn Greenwald, under the Terrorism Act 2000, saying that critics of the Metropolitan Police action needed to \"think about what they are condoning\". Lib Dem peer and former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald accused May of an \"ugly and unhelpful\" attempt to implicate those who were concerned about the police action of \"condoning terrorism\". The High Court subsequently acknowledged there were \"indirect implications for press freedom\" but ruled the detention legal.\n\nMay also championed legislation popularly dubbed the Snooper's Charter, requiring internet and mobile service providers to keep records of internet usage, voice calls, messages and email for up to a year in case police requested access to the records while investigating a crime. The Liberal Democrats had blocked the first attempt, but after the Conservative Party obtained a majority in the 2015 general election May announced a new Draft Investigatory Powers Bill similar to the Draft Communications Data Bill, although with more limited powers and additional oversight.\n\nSpeaking at the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) conference in June 2010, May announced radical cuts to the Home Office budget, likely to lead to a reduction in police numbers. In July 2010, May presented the House of Commons with proposals for a fundamental review of the previous Labour government's security and counter-terrorism legislation, including \"stop and search\" powers, and her intention to review the 28-day limit on detaining terrorist suspects without charge.\n\nIn July 2010, May announced a package of reforms to policing in England and Wales in the House of Commons. The previous Labour Government's central crime agency, Soca (Serious Organised Crime Agency), was to be replaced by a new National Crime Agency. In common with the Conservative Party 2010 general election manifesto's flagship proposal for a \"Big Society\" based on voluntary action, May also proposed increasing the role of civilian \"reservists\" for crime control. The reforms were rejected by the Opposition Labour Party.\n\nFollowing the actions of some members of Black Bloc in vandalising allegedly tax-avoiding shops and businesses on the day of the March 2011 TUC march, the Home Secretary unveiled reforms curbing the right to protest, including giving police extra powers to remove masked individuals and to police social networking sites to prevent illegal protest without police consent or notification.\n\nIn 2012, despite inquiries by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruling that there was no new evidence to warrant further investigation, after discussions with Dame Doreen Lawrence, May commissioned Mark Ellison to review Scotland Yard's investigations into alleged police corruption. The report was presented to Parliament by May on 6 March 2014. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police said the report, which has prompted an inquiry into undercover policing, was \"devastating\".\n\nIn July 2013, May welcomed the fact that crime had fallen by more than 10% under the coalition government, while still being able to make savings. She said that this was partly due to the government removing red tape and scrapping targets to allow the police to concentrate on crime fighting.\n\nIn 2014, May delivered a speech to the Police Federation, in which she criticised aspects of the culture of the police force. In the speech, she said:\n\nOn 9 December 2010, in the wake of violent student demonstrations in central London against increases to higher-education tuition fees, May praised the actions of the police in controlling the demonstrations but was described by \"The Daily Telegraph\" as \"under growing political pressure\" due to her handling of the protests.\n\nIn December 2010, May declared that deployment of water cannon by police forces in mainland Britain was an operational decision which had been \"resisted until now by senior police officers.\" She rejected their use following the widespread rioting in summer 2011 and said: \"the way we police in Britain is not through use of water cannon. The way we police in Britain is through consent of communities.\" May said: \"I condemn utterly the violence in Tottenham... Such disregard for public safety and property will not be tolerated, and the Metropolitan Police have my full support in restoring order.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the riots May urged the identification of as many as possible of the young criminals involved. She said: \"when I was in Manchester last week, the issue was raised to me about the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of crimes of this sort. The Crown Prosecution Service is to order prosecutors to apply for anonymity to be lifted in any youth case they think is in the public interest. The law currently protects the identity of any suspect under the age of 18, even if they are convicted, but it also allows for an application to have such restrictions lifted, if deemed appropriate.\" May added that \"what I've asked for is that CPS guidance should go to prosecutors to say that where possible, they should be asking for the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of criminal activity to be lifted\".\n\nIn July 2010, May proposed to review the previous Labour Government's anti-social behaviour legislation signalling the abolition of the \"Anti-Social Behaviour Order\" (ASBO). She identified the policy's high level of failure with almost half of ASBOs breached between 2000 and 2008, leading to \"fast-track\" criminal convictions. May proposed a less punitive, community-based approach to tackling social disorder. May suggested that anti-social behaviour policy \"must be turned on its head\", reversing the ASBO's role as the flagship crime control policy legislation under Labour. Former Labour Home Secretaries David Blunkett (who introduced ASBOs) and Alan Johnson expressed their disapproval of the proposals.\n\nIn July 2013, May decided to ban the stimulant khat, against the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The council reached the conclusion that there was \"insufficient evidence\" it caused health problems. Explaining the change in the classification May said: \"The decision to bring khat under control is finely balanced and takes into account the expert scientific advice and these broader concerns\", and pointed out that the product had already been banned in the majority of other EU member states, as well as most of the G8 countries including Canada and the US. A report on khat use by the ACMD published in January 2013 had noted the product had been associated with \"acute psychotic episodes\", \"chronic liver disease\" and family breakdown. However, it concluded that there is no risk of harm for most users, and recommended that khat remain uncontrolled due to lack of evidence for these associations.\n\nLiberal Democrat minister Norman Baker accused May of suppressing proposals to treat rather than prosecute minor drug offenders from a report into drug policy commissioned by the Home Office. The Home Office denied that its officials had considered this as part of their strategy. Baker cited difficulties in working with May as the reason for his resignation from the Home Office in the run-up to the 2015 general election.\n\nIn 2010, May promised to bring the level of net migration down to less than 100,000. \"The Independent\" reported in February 2015, \"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014—up from 210,000 in the previous year.\" In total, 624,000 people migrated to the UK in the year ending September 2014 and 327,000 left in the same period. Statistics showed \"significant increases in migration among both non-EU citizens—up 49,000 to 292,000—and EU citizens, which rose by 43,000 to 251,000.\"\n\nIn May 2012 she told the Daily Telegraph of her intention \"to create here in Britain a really hostile environment for illegal migration,”\n\nMay rejected the European Union's proposal of compulsory refugee quotas. She said that it was important to help people living in war-zone regions and refugee camps but \"not the ones who are strong and rich enough to come to Europe\". In May 2016, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that she had tried to save £4m by rejecting an intelligence project to use aircraft surveillance to detect illegal immigrant boats.\n\nIn June 2012, Theresa May announced that new restrictions would be introduced to reduce the number of non-European Economic Area family migrants. The changes were mostly intended to apply to new applicants after 9 July 2012.\n\nThe newly introduced rules came into effect on 9 July 2012 allowing only those British citizens earning more than £18,600 to bring their spouses or their children to live with them in the UK. This figure would rise significantly in cases where visa applications are also made for children. They also increased the current two-year probationary period for partners to 5 years. The rules also prevent any adult and elderly dependents from settling in the UK unless they can demonstrate that, as a result of age, illness or disability, they require a level of long-term personal care that can only be provided by a relative in the UK.\n\nThe House of Lords was concerned about the immigration issue and therefore addressed the PM in Parliament as to whether she had examined the impact on communities and families on modest incomes, but it received no direct response. The human rights group Liberty concluded that the new rules showed scant regard to the impact they would have on genuine families. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration conducted an evidence based inquiry into the impact of the rules and concluded in their report that the rules were causing very young children to be separated from their parents and could exile British citizens from the UK.\n\nAt the Conservative Party Conference in October 2011, while arguing that the Human Rights Act needed to be amended, May gave the example of a foreign national who the Courts ruled was allowed to remain in the UK, \"because—and I am not making this up—he had a pet cat\". In response, the Royal Courts of Justice issued a statement, denying that this was the reason for the tribunal's decision in that case, and stating that the real reason was that he was in a genuine relationship with a British partner, and owning a pet cat was simply one of many pieces of evidence given to show that the relationship was \"genuine\". The Home Office had failed to apply its own rules for dealing with unmarried partners of people settled in the UK. Amnesty International said May's comments only fuelled \"myths and misconceptions\" about the Human Rights Act and Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke subsequently called May's comments \"laughable and childlike.\"\n\nIn June 2012, May was found in contempt of court by Judge Barry Cotter, and stood accused of \"totally unacceptable and regrettable behaviour\", being said to have shown complete disregard for a legal agreement to free an Algerian from a UK Immigration Detention Centre. As she eventually allowed the prisoner to be freed, May avoided further sanctions including fines or imprisonment.\n\nMay responded to a Supreme Court decision in November 2013 to overturn her predecessor Jacqui Smith's revocation of Iraqi-born terror suspect Al Jedda's British citizenship by ordering it to be revoked for a second time, making him the first person to be stripped twice of British citizenship.\n\nMay was accused by Lord Roberts of being willing to allow someone to die \"to score a political point\" over the deportation of mentally ill Nigerian man Isa Muazu. According to Muazu's solicitor, May had arranged for the asylum seeker, who was said to be \"near death\" after a 100-day hunger strike, to be deported by a chartered private jet.\nTo strengthen the Home Office's tough stance an \"end of life\" plan was reportedly offered to Muazu, who was one of a number of hunger strikers at the Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre.\n\nOn 7 July 2013, Abu Qatada, a radical cleric arrested in 2002, was deported to Jordan after a decade-long battle that had cost the nation £1.7 million in legal fees, and numerous prior Home Secretaries had been unable to resolve. The deportation was the result of a treaty negotiated by May in April 2013, under which Jordan agreed to give Qatada a fair trial, by not using evidence that may have been obtained through torture against him.\n\nMay has frequently pointed to Qatada's deportation as a triumph, guaranteeing in September 2013 that \"he will not be returning to the UK\", and declaring in her 2016 leadership campaign announcement that she was told that she \"couldn't deport Abu Qatada\" but that she \"flew to Jordan and negotiated the treaty that got him out of Britain for good\". The Qatada deportation also shaped May's views on the European Convention on Human Rights and European Court of Human Rights, saying that they had \"moved the goalposts\" and had a \"crazy interpretation of our human rights laws\", as a result, May has since campaigned against the institutions, saying that British withdrawal from them should be considered.\n\nIn August 2013, the Home Office engaged in an advertising campaign directed at illegal immigrants. The advertisements, in the form of mobile advertising hoardings on the back of lorries, told illegal immigrants to \"go home or face arrest\", with an image of a person in handcuffs, and were deployed in six London boroughs with substantial ethnic minority populations. They were widely criticized as creating a hostile atmosphere for members of ethnic minority groups. The shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, described their language as being reminiscent of that used by the National Front in the 1970s. An adjudication by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that \"the claim [that 106 arrests were made last week] was misleading and had not been substantiated\" was followed by the advertisements being withdrawn after being banned by the ASA.\n\nIn mid 2014, the Passport Office faced a backlog in developing processing passport applications, with around 30,000 applications hit by delays. David Cameron suggested this had come about due to the Passport Office's receiving an \"above normal\" 300,000-rise in applications. It was revealed, however, that May had been warned the year before, in July 2013, that a surge of 350,000 extra applications could occur owing to the closure of processing overseas under Chancellor Osborne's programme of cuts. Around £674,000 was paid to staff who helped clear the backlog.\n\nIn April 2018, May's hostile environment policy became the focus of British politics in what came to be known as the Windrush scandal, in which members of the Windrush generation of Afro-Caribbean Britons were threatened with deportation by the Home Office. The scandal led to the removal of Amber Rudd as Home Secretary and her replacement by Sajid Javid. Responding to questions in Parliament on the Windrush scandal on 25 April, May maintained that the hostile environment policy would remain government policy.\n\nIn June 2014, an inflamed public argument arose between Home Office and Education Ministers about responsibility for alleged extremism in Birmingham schools. Prime Minister David Cameron intervened to resolve the row, insisting that May sack her Special Advisor Fiona Cunningham (now Hill) for releasing on May's website a confidential letter to May's colleagues, and that Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, apologise to the Home Office's head of Security and Counter-Terrorism, Charles Farr, for uncomplimentary briefings of him appearing on the front page of \"The Times\".\n\nMay held the office of Minister for Women and Equality in parallel to her office of Home Secretary from 2010 to September 2012, when this role was taken over by Maria Miller.\n\nMay's appointment as Minister for Women and Equality was criticised by some members of the LGBT rights movement, because she had voted against lowering the age of consent (in 1998) and against greater adoption rights for homosexuals (in 2002), though she had voted in favour of civil partnerships. May later stated, during an appearance on the BBC's \"Question Time\" in 2010, that she had \"changed her mind\" on gay adoption. Writing for \"PinkNews\" in June 2010, May clarified her proposals for improving LGBT rights including measures to tackle homophobia in sport, advocating British society's need for \"cultural change\".\n\nOn 2 July 2010, May stated she would be supporting the previous Labour Government's Anti-Discrimination Laws enshrined in the Equality Act 2010 despite having opposed it before. The Equality Act came into effect in England, Wales and Scotland on 1 October 2010. She did however announce that a clause she dubbed \"Harman's Law\" which would have required public bodies to consider how they can reduce socio-economic inequalities when making decisions about spending and services would be scrapped on the grounds that it was \"unworkable\".\n\nOn 30 June 2016, May announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party to replace David Cameron, who resigned following the outcome of the European Union membership referendum in which 52% of voters voted in favour of leaving the EU. May emphasised the need for unity within the party regardless of positions on leaving the EU, saying she could bring \"strong leadership\" and a \"positive vision\" for the country's future. Despite having backed a vote to remain in the EU, she insisted that there would be no second referendum, saying: \"The campaign was fought... and the public gave their verdict. There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door... Brexit means Brexit\". An opinion poll that day found 47% of people choosing May as their preferred candidate to be Prime Minister.\n\nMay's supporters included a number of Cabinet ministers, such as Amber Rudd, Chris Grayling, Justine Greening, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Fallon and Patrick McLoughlin. She won the first round of voting on 5 July, receiving support from 165 MPs, with rivals Andrea Leadsom receiving 66 votes and Michael Gove 48. After the results were announced, May said she was \"pleased\" and \"grateful\" for the support of other MPs and confirmed that she wanted to unite the party and the UK, to negotiate the \"best possible deal as we leave the EU\", and to \"make Britain work for everyone\". The two candidates with the fewest votes, Liam Fox and Stephen Crabb, immediately announced their support for May. May came in first place in the second ballot on 7 July with an overwhelming majority of 199 MPs, compared with 84 for Leadsom and 46 for Gove, who was eliminated. Afterwards, May stated that she was delighted with her support among MPs, and she progressed to a vote of the Conservative Party membership against Leadsom.\n\nOn 11 July, Leadsom announced her withdrawal from the leadership contest hours after May had made her first official campaign speech, saying her lack of support amongst Conservative MPs compared to May would be too great a hindrance to becoming a credible Prime Minister. As the sole remaining candidate, May was formally declared Leader of the Conservative Party that evening.\n\nOn 13 July 2016, two days after becoming Leader of the Conservative Party, May was appointed Prime Minister by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming only the second female British Prime Minister after Margaret Thatcher, and the first female British Prime Minister of the 21st century. Addressing the world's media outside 10 Downing Street, May said that she was \"honoured and humbled\" to become Prime Minister. On becoming Prime Minister, May became the first woman to have held two of the Great Offices of State.\n\nResponding to some calls for an early general election, \"sources close to Mrs May\" said there was no need for such an election. In a speech after her appointment, May emphasised the term \"Unionist\" in the name of the Conservative Party, reminding all of \"the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\" By 15 July, May had travelled to Edinburgh to meet with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to reinforce the bond between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. \"I'm coming here to show my commitment to preserving this special union that has endured for centuries,\" she explained.\n\nMay's first Cabinet appointment was described by Reuters as \"one of the most sweeping government reshuffles for decades\", and called \"a brutal cull\" by \"The Daily Telegraph\". Nine of Cameron's ministers, including several prominent members, were sacked or resigned from their posts. The early appointments were interpreted both as an effort to reunite the Conservative Party in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the EU and as \"a shift to the right,\" according to \"The Guardian\". ITV's Political Editor Robert Peston commented: \"Her rhetoric is more left-wing than Cameron's was, her cabinet is more right-wing than his was.\" Although May had supported remaining in the EU, she appointed several of the most prominent advocates of Brexit to key Cabinet positions responsible for negotiating the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union, including Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary, David Davis as Brexit Secretary, and Liam Fox as International Trade Secretary, the latter two being new positions. Other key appointees included Amber Rudd as Home Secretary and Philip Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nThe First May ministry delayed the final approval for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in July 2016, a project which May had objected to when she was Home Secretary. Her political adviser Nick Timothy wrote an article in 2015 to oppose China's involvement in sensitive sectors. He said that the government was \"selling our national security to China\" without rational concerns and \"the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies\".\n\nIn July 2016, when George Kerevan asked her whether she would be prepared to authorise the killing of a hundred thousand innocent persons by a nuclear strike; during the \"Trident debate\" inside the House of Commons, May said \"Yes. And I have to say to the honourable gentleman: the whole point of a deterrent is that our enemies need to know that we would be prepared to use it. Unlike some suggestions that we could have a nuclear deterrent but not actually be willing to use it, which come from the Labour Party frontbench.\"\n\nOn 20 July, May attended her first Prime Minister's Questions since taking office, then afterwards made her first overseas trip as prime minister, visiting Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. During the visit, May said that she would not trigger Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon—the process for withdrawing from the European Union—before 2017, suggesting it would take time for the UK to negotiate a \"sensible and orderly departure\" from the EU. However, although Merkel said it was right for the UK to \"take a moment\" before beginning the process, she urged May to provide more clarity on a timetable for negotiations. Shortly before travelling to Berlin, May had also announced that in the wake of the referendum, Britain would relinquish the presidency of the Council of the European Union, which passes between member states every six months on a rotation basis, and that the UK had been scheduled to hold in the second half of 2017.\n\nMay supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and defended selling arms to Saudi Arabia, which is accused of committing war crimes in Yemen, insisting that Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia was \"helping keep people on the streets of Britain safe\".\nOn 21 January 2017, following the inauguration of Donald Trump as US President, the White House announced that May would meet the President on 27 January, making her the first foreign leader to meet Trump since he took office on 20 January. In a joint press conference, May indicated an interest in increased trade between the United States and the United Kingdom. She also affirmed a desire to maintain an American involvement in NATO. May was criticised by members of major parties, including her own, for refusing to condemn Trump's Executive Order 13769, as well as for inviting Trump to a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn January 2017, when it came to light that a Trident test had malfunctioned in June 2016, May refused to confirm whether she knew about the incident when she addressed parliament.\nIn May's and Hammond's 2017 budget continued government policies of freezing benefits.\n\nOn 18 April, May announced that she would call a parliamentary vote to hold an early general election on 8 June, saying that it was the \"only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead\". May had previously ruled out an early election on five occasions over nine months. The election was the first snap election held under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 after MPs gave May the two-thirds super-majority required.\n\nUnveiling the Conservative manifesto in Halifax on 18 May, May promised a \"mainstream government that would deliver for mainstream Britain\". It proposed to balance the budget by 2025, raise spending on the NHS by £8bn per annum and on schools by £4bn per annum by 2022, remove the ban on new grammar schools, means-test the winter fuel allowance, replace the state pension \"triple lock\" with a \"double lock\" and require executive pay to be approved by a vote of shareholders. It dropped the 2015 pledge to not raise income tax or national insurance contributions but maintained a commitment to freeze VAT. New sovereign wealth funds for infrastructure, rules to prevent foreign takeovers of \"critical national infrastructure\" and institutes of technology were also proposed. The manifesto was noted for its intervention in industry, lack of tax cuts and increased spending commitments on public services. On Brexit it committed to leaving the single market and customs union while seeking a \"deep and special partnership\" and promised a vote in parliament on the final agreement.\n\nThe manifesto also proposed reforms to social care in England that would raise the threshold for free care from £23,250 to £100,000 while including property in the means test and permitting deferred payment after death. After attracting substantial media attention, four days after the manifesto launch May stated that the proposed social care reforms would now include an \"absolute limit\" on costs in contrast to the rejection of a cap in the manifesto. She criticised the \"fake\" portrayal of the policy in recent days by Labour and other critics who had termed it a \"dementia tax\". \"Evening Standard\" editor George Osborne called the policy change a \"U-turn\". \"The Financial Times\" contrasted her \"Strong and Stable\" leadership slogan with her own record of nine rapid U-turns claiming she was \"making a habit of retreating from policies.\"\n\nThe general election in June resulted in a hung parliament, prompting her to broker a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), involving £1 billion of additional public funding for Northern Ireland.\n\nLess than 2 weeks after the 2017 State Opening of Parliament, May ordered a full public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal. For this she was widely praised as successive governments going back to the 1980s had refused such an inquiry, some though speculated that May had simply been forced to announce the inquiry after a group legal action and news of fresh evidence were brought by Jason Evans. Additionally, Andy Burnham had threatened to take evidence to the police if an inquiry were not announced. With over 1,000 core participants, the Infected Blood Inquiry is the biggest public inquiry ever held in the UK.\nIn November 2017, May said the actions of Myanmar Army and police against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar “looks like ethnic cleansing”. According to May, \"it is something for which the Burmese authorities – and especially the military – must take full responsibility.\" From the 2017 general election to December 2017, May suffered no defeats in whipped votes in the House of Commons. On 13 December 2017, May lost a vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill by 309 votes to 305, due to 11 Conservatives voting against the government, including Stephen Hammond who was then Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party.\n\nMay accused Russia of \"threatening the international order\", \"seeking to weaponise information\" and \"deploying its state-run media organisations to plant fake stories\". She mentioned Russia's meddling in German federal election in 2017, after German government officials and security experts said there was no Russian interference.\n\nMay promised to confront China on human rights but was praised in Communist Party-controlled media for 'sidestepping' human rights in China during her first official visit to the country. The \"Global Times\" said: \"For the Prime Minister, the losses outweigh the gains if she appeases the British media at the cost of the visit’s friendly atmosphere.\"\n\nIn May 2018, during a three-day state visit to the UK by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, May declared that Britain is a \"true friend\" of Turkey, but she added that \"It is important that in defense of democracy, which has been facing extraordinary pressures from the failed coup, instability across the border from Syria and from Kurdish terrorism, Turkey does not lose sight of the values it is seeking to defend.\"\n\nMay had a high approval rating during her first week as Prime Minister. The results of an Ipsos MORI survey released in July 2016 indicated that 55% of those surveyed believed that May was a suitable PM while only 23% believed that the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would make a good Prime Minister.\n\nA \"ComRes\" poll taken in September 2016 after her election suggested May was seen as substantially more \"in touch with ordinary British people\" than her predecessor David Cameron and a majority of voters saw her as \"the right person to unite the country\".\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, nearly six months after becoming Prime Minister, a ComRes found May was the most popular UK politician with a net rating of +9 which was described as the longest honeymoon period enjoyed by any sitting Conservative Prime Minister since the end of the Second World War.\n\nThe Conservative Party had a 21-point lead over Labour in a poll released the day before May announced a snap election but this lead narrowed substantially. In mid-June, following the election, a YouGov poll showed that May's popularity had dropped to a rating of −34. In April 2018, May had a higher approval rating than Corbyn for the first time since the general election, leading him by -13 to -23.\n\nMay has identified herself with the one-nation conservative position within her party.\n\nSince coming into prominence as a front-bench politician, May's public image has divided media opinion, especially from some in the traditionalist right-wing press. Commenting on May's debut as Home Secretary, Anne Perkins of \"The Guardian\" observed that \"she'll be nobody's stooge\", while Cristina Odone of \"The Daily Telegraph\" predicted her to be \"the rising star\" of the Coalition Government. Allegra Stratton, then with \"The Guardian\", praised May as showing managerial acumen.\n\nDescribing her as a liberal Conservative, the \"Financial Times\" characterised May as a \"non-ideological politician with a ruthless streak who gets on with the job\", in doing so comparing her to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Conversely, in \"The Independent\", Rebecca Glover of the Policy Innovation Research Unit contrasted May to Boris Johnson, claiming that she was \"staunchly more conservative, more anti-immigration, and more isolationist\" than he was.\n\nDuring her leadership campaign, May said that \"We need an economy that works for everyone\", pledging to crack down on executive pay by making shareholders' votes binding rather than advisory and to put workers onto company boards (although she later claimed that the last pledge was not to be mandatory), policies that \"The Guardian\" describes as going further than the Labour Party's 2015 general election manifesto.\n\nAfter she became Prime Minister, May's first speech espoused the left, with a promise to combat the \"burning injustice\" in British society and to create a union \"between all of our citizens\" and promising to be an advocate for the \"ordinary working-class family\" and not for the affluent in the UK. \"The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives ... When we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws we’ll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes we’ll prioritise not the wealthy but you.\"\n\nMay has described herself as a personal supporter of fox hunting with hounds, saying that foxes' numbers had to be controlled and that hunting them with dogs was the most humane way to do it. The Conservative manifesto for the 2017 election included a pledge to hold a parliamentary vote to repeal the Hunting Act 2004, which prohibits a range of hunting activities.\n\nAfter the Conservatives' manifesto for the 2017 election was released, some people, including Fraser Nelson of \"The Spectator\", called her a \"red Tory\", saying that she had moved her party to the left in politics. \"Politico\" called her policies \"Mayism\", saying that Mayism was \"a working-class conservatism openly critical of the “cult of individualism” and globalization\".\n\nIn 1998 May voted against lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts, and was absent for the vote on the repeal of Section 28 in 2003. In May 2012, however, May expressed support for the introduction of same-sex marriage by recording a video for the Out4Marriage campaign, in which she stated \"I believe if two people care for each other, if they love each other, if they want to commit to each other... then they should be able to get married and marriage should be for everyone\". In May 2013, May voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, which legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales.\n\nMay publicly stated her support for the UK remaining in the EU during the 2016 referendum campaign, but did not campaign extensively in the referendum and criticised aspects of the EU in a speech. It was speculated by political journalists that May had sought to minimise her involvement in the debate to strengthen her position as a future candidate for the Conservative party leadership. Some in David Cameron's ministry likened May to a \"submarine\" on the issue of Brexit due to her perceived indifference towards the referendum and the EU.\n\nIn a leaked recording prior to the Brexit referendum, May said,\nMay also said Britain was more secure as part of the EU due to the European arrest warrant and Europe-wide information sharing among other factors. She said, \"There are definitely things we can do as members of the European Union that I think keep us more safe\".\nMay's public reticence during the referendum campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled that she would support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later went on to say before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that \"no deal is better than a bad deal. We have to be prepared to walk out\". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was \"disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market.\" Phil Wilson for the Open Britain group said, \"It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position.\"\n\nOn 22 September 2017, May officially made public the details of her Brexit proposal during a speech in Florence, urging the European Union to maintain a transitional period of two years after Brexit during which trade terms remain unaltered. During this period, the UK would also continue to honor its budget commitments of about €10 billion per annum, and accept immigration from Europe. Her speech was criticised by leading Eurosceptic Nigel Farage. The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed May's proposal as \"constructive,\" but said it also \"must be translated into negotiating positions to make meaningful progress.\"<br> In late October 2018 the National Audit Office warned her that it was already too late to prepare the necessary Irish border security checks in the event of a No-deal scenario -a weakness that organised crime would be quick to exploit.\n\nMay has been married to Philip May, an investment banker currently employed by Capital International, since 6 September 1980; the couple have no children. It is widely believed that former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto introduced the two during their time at Oxford. May has expressed regret that she and her husband were not able to have children. The Mays are passionate hikers, and they regularly spend their holidays hiking in the Swiss Alps. May is also a cricket fan, claiming Geoffrey Boycott was one of her sporting heroes. She also likes cooking, and has said that she owns 100 cookery books. Philip has said that she \"is a very good cook\".\n\nMay is a member of the Church of England and regularly worships at church on Sunday. The daughter of an Anglican priest, the Reverend Hubert Brasier, May has said that her Christian faith \"is part of me. It is part of who I am and therefore how I approach things\".\n\nMay is known for a love of fashion, and in particular of distinctive shoes; she wore leopard-print shoes at her 'Nasty Party' speech in 2002, as well as her final Cabinet meeting as Home Secretary in 2016. On \"Desert Island Discs\" in 2014 she chose a subscription to \"Vogue\" as her luxury item. However, she has been critical of the media focusing on her fashion instead of her achievements as a politician.\n\nMay was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus of type 1 in November 2012. She is treated with daily insulin injections.\n\nPrior to and since her appointment to Government, May has actively supported a variety of campaigns on policy issues in her constituency and at the national level of politics. She has spoken at the Fawcett Society promoting the cross-party issue of gender equality. May was nominated as one of the Society's Inspiring Women of 2006.\n\nShe is the Patron of Reading University Conservative Association, in Berkshire (the county of her Maidenhead constituency).\n\nIn February 2013, BBC Radio 4's \"Woman's Hour\" already described her as Britain's second-most powerful woman after Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nOn 30 November 2014 She was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the World Sikh University. \n\nIn April 2017, during an official trip to Saudi Arabia, May was appointed to the Order of King Abdulaziz. That September she was listed by \"Forbes\" as the second most powerful woman in the world, behind Angela Merkel.\n\n\n"}
