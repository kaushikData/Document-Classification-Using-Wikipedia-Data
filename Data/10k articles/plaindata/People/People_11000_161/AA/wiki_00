In 2011, he came up with the idea of turning Egypt's National Police Day on 25 January into a Facebook event, \"Revolution of the Egyptian People,\" sparking the online campaign for pro-democracy demonstrations that later snowballed into a popular uprising.\n\nAbout to start his compulsory military service in early January 2011, just before 25 January revolution, Mansour remained anonymous without announcing his role as the underground Cairo-based administrator of the Facebook page \"We are all Khaled Saeed\", the main online tool that mobilized the initial mass protests against torture and police brutality, and which culminated weeks later in the ouster of Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled the country for the previous three decades. Wael Ghonim, who was living abroad at the time, was the page's publicly known administrator.\n\nAbdelrahman was born to a middle-class family in 1987 in Mansoura, Egypt. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism and Broadcasting from Mansoura University in 2010. After his graduation and immediate conscription, he traveled to the United States in late 2013 to continue his academic studies.\n\nHe first became politically active in 2005, joining the protest movement Kefaya to demand political reforms in Egypt, and later participated in student movements across several Egyptian universities. Since then, he has been active in raising awareness among Arab audiences on the importance of political activism, citizen movements and broadcasting \n\nAbdelrahman became an active blogger with “Kulina Layla (We are all Layla),” a feminist initiative that provided Arab women with an electronic platform to counter conservative voices in mainstream social media. He worked to expand the platform, introducing it in Morocco and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn 2009, he began collaborating with Wael Ghonim to moderate and manage the online page of Mohamed Elbaradei, who had returned to Egypt the same year. After the tragic death of Khalid Saeed, the two online activists started the Facebook page \"We Are All Khaled Saeed\".\n\nIn 2010, Abdelrahman and Wael Ghonim founded the Facebook page, \"We Are All Khaled Saeed,\" to commemorate the death of Khaled Saeed, a young Egyptian who was tortured to death by police in Alexandria in the same year. They utilized the page, with up to 3,000,000 followers, to mobilize for anti-government and anti-torture protests on 25 January. On 14 January, Abdelrahman conducted a survey on the page to test the waters, asking members if they would follow in the footsteps of Tunisians and take to the streets on 25 January. Enough enthusiasm poured prompting him and Wael to generate an online event entitled: 25 يناير ثورة على التعذيب والفساد والظلم والبطالة (January 25: Revolution against Torture, Corruption, Unemployment and Injustice). This first call to protests was soon picked up by many other activists. Both Abdelrahman and Wael collaborated anonymously with other activists on-the-ground to plan the locations for the protests.\n\nThe page was also influential in organizing innovative activities such as the Silent Stands and the Police Communication Campaign.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprising in Egypt, Abdelrahman criticized the country's Islamists for their misrule; mainly \"marginalizing other political forces\" and sidelining youth groups. He also criticized young activists, or revolutionaries, for their lack of political engagement and failing to develop a political platform that builds on their protest demands.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56659625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56659625", "title": "Alan Hodge", "text": "Alan Hodge\n\nAlan Hodge (16 October 1915 – 25 May 1979) was an English historian and journalist. He was a member of the circle of writers and artists that centred around Laura Riding and Robert Graves in the late 1930s, and later collaborated with Graves on \"The Long Week-End\", a social history of Britain between the wars, and \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder\", a guide to writing English prose. After the Second World War he worked as the general editor of Hamish Hamilton's Novel Library, as an editorial assistant on Winston Churchill's \"History of the English-Speaking Peoples\", and as a founding co-editor (with Peter Quennell) of the successful magazine \"History Today\".\n\nAlan Hodge was born on 16 October 1915 in Scarborough, Yorkshire; his father was T. S. Hodge, a Cunard Line captain and officer in the Royal Naval Reserve. He grew up in Liverpool and attended Liverpool Collegiate School before going up to Oriel College, Oxford where he read history. In his spare time he wrote poetry and, with Kenneth Allott, co-edited the Oxford University English Club's magazine, \"Programme\".\n\nIn 1935 Hodge, then in his second year at Oriel, wrote a review of the first volume of \"Epilogue\", an irregular critical journal, which led to a correspondence with its editor, the American poet Laura Riding. Riding invited Hodge to visit her at the house in Majorca she shared with Robert Graves, and Hodge duly turned up in time for Christmas. He made an excellent impression; Graves noted in his diary, \"Hodge very decent & sensible\", and described him as \"young, blonde good head\". Another description of his appearance a year or so later described him as \"a small blond boy with a cherubic soprano's face, an incongruously deep and hollow voice, and a deliberate, sententious manner; he seemed about sixteen\". Hodge went home in early January 1936, but returned the following July to spend the summer holidays there. He was kept busy helping with a planned series of schoolbooks, contributing to \"Epilogue\", and writing poems. During July the Spanish Civil War broke out, and on 2 August, acting on official advice, the entire household left Majorca aboard a British destroyer. Hodge settled in London with his new girlfriend Beryl Pritchard, a PPE student he had met at Oxford, but remained a part of the circle of writers and artists dominated by Laura Riding. Before long he decided to return to Spain to work for the beleaguered Socialist government, despite himself being a lifelong Conservative, but Riding told him he must stay in England. Hodge, who was becoming her closest disciple, acquiesced. At this time he was working on a novel called \"A Year of Damage\", based on his experiences with a former girlfriend, Audrey Beecham, and by the spring of 1937 it was completed. Graves and Riding supervised its progress closely and made many suggestions for its improvement, all of which he adopted, but though both of them loved the finished book Hodge wouldn't publish it, and destroyed the manuscript. In the second half of 1937 he used his skills as a historical researcher to help Graves with the writing of \"Count Belisarius\", a novel set in the early Byzantine Empire; and at about the same time they worked on a historical survey of the influence of politics on literature, eventually published in Harry Kemp and Laura Riding's book \"The Left Heresy in Literature and Life\". These were only the first results of a fruitful partnership between the two friends.\n\nOn 29 January 1938 Hodge and Beryl Pritchard were married. Beryl had previously doubted it was a good idea, but Hodge won her round; Beryl's parents were less amenable, her father being rude to Hodge at the wedding, and her mother telling her she was throwing her life away. In June Riding, Graves, the Hodges and two more of the coterie travelled to Rennes in Brittany and found a large country house, which they rented and moved into. A year later the entire party took ship for America, where an old friend of Graves, the journalist Tom Matthews, had engaged to find them a home. The atmosphere in the new community became increasingly claustrophobic and nightmarish as Riding's domination grew more oppressive, and in a few months the group broke up. Hodge, utterly disillusioned with Riding, returned to England with Graves in August, Beryl being expected to follow shortly after. By now the dynamic of the Hodge marriage had completely changed, both coming to suspect that theirs was more a friendship than a romance, while Beryl and Graves had gradually fallen in love with each other. On arriving in England Hodge immediately set out on a journalistic assignment to Poland, and was in Warsaw when the German army invaded the country. He managed to return to England by a circuitous journey via Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Beryl reached England from America in October and moved in with Graves, a situation which Hodge, after some initial resistance, accepted without ill-feeling. Beryl remained with Graves for the rest of his life, while Hodge kept his close friendship with both.\n\nHodge now resumed his literary partnership with Graves, beginning with some historical research on the American War of Independence for Graves's Sergeant Lamb novels. The next project, \"The Long Week-End\", was intended as \"a reliable record of what took place, of a forgettable sort, during the twenty-one-year interval between the two great European wars\", for which Hodge did research work and wrote first drafts of several of the chapters. The evidence was mainly drawn from ephemeral sources, such as newspapers, magazines and radio broadcasts, and the book depicted British life in this period as being mainly devoted to frivolities and distractions. \"The Long Week-End\" was completed in June 1940 and published the following November by Faber and Faber, with Graves and Hodge being credited as co-authors. There have been many subsequent editions in Britain and the United States, it has been translated into Danish and Swedish and even published in Braille. On its first publication the reaction of academe was mixed. One historian detected the malign influence of the Mass-Observation movement in the authors' approach, and called it \"a strange unfocused photograph of the times, in which, although the 'camera-eye' has not lied, it has failed entirely to introduce any perspective or integration\", but the sociologist Alfred McClung Lee thought it \"regrettable that so few books do so well the useful task Graves and Hodge assigned themselves\". Press reviews had some very enthusiastic things to say: \"thoroughly good reading\", \"swift, ironic, entertaining...fair and penetrating and a thoroughly significant book today\", \"it could hardly have been better done\". More recently it has been described as \"stimulating and well-informed\", and by Francis Wheen as \"enthralling\", while for the historian Alfred F. Havighurst \"nothing has as yet replaced\" it as a social history of the period.\n\nBy August 1940 the two were working together on what Graves called a \"new book about English prose...for the general reader, and also for intelligent colleges and VI-forms\". Originally intended to help Graves's daughter Jenny Nicholson, it was eventually published as \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose\". Its plan, which owes something to Riding's 1938 work \"The World and Ourselves\", is as follows: first come chapters entitled \"The Peculiar Qualities of English\", \"The Present Confusion of English Prose\", \"Where Is Good English to Be Found?\", and \"The Use and Abuse of Official English\"; then a history of English prose, quoting many examples; then chapters on \"The Principles of Clear Statement\" and \"The Graces of Prose\"; finally, taking up the greater part of the book, the authors present under the title \"Examinations and Fair Copies\" fifty-four stylistically aberrant passages by well-known writers, analyze their faults, and rewrite them in better English. This last section, according to the academic Denis Donoghue, \"accounted for much of the fame and nearly all of the delight that the book has given its readers\". Getting copyright waivers from each of the 54 writers made demands on the co-authors' time, and since this section was, in Graves's words, \"dynamite under so many chairs\", also on their diplomacy. Their private nickname for the book was \"A Short Cut to Unpopularity\". The publishers Faber and Faber initially accepted the book while it was still in progress, but later took fright and dropped it; it was finally published in May 1943 by Jonathan Cape. There have been several later editions, some at full length and some drastically abridged. G. W. Stonier, reviewing \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder\" in the \"New Statesman and Nation\", regretted that \"a book, whose general aims are admirable, should be spoilt so often by its pedantry\", but most other contemporary reviews were favourable: \"it might seem that \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder\" would be unavoidably dry on questions of punctuation and grammar, but even here it is witty and stimulating — a desk-book for the writer that should never fail to key him up\", \"a stimulating and stirring book, which meets a great and genuine need of our times\", \"instructive and entertaining book\", \"highly pleasurable and in some degree profitable\", \"any editor of [this journal] would mortgage the office filing cabinet to place this book before the eyes of every contributor\". \"The Spectator\" wryly noted that \"this book, with its high standards, its scholarship and its brilliance, is exactly calculated to suit the contemporary taste for spiced and potted knowledge which it deplores\". Evelyn Waugh wrote in \"The Tablet\", \"This is the century of the common man; let him write as he speaks and let him speak as he pleases. This the deleterious opinion to which \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder\" provides a welcome corrective\"; he ended, \"as a result of having read [it]...I have taken about three times as long to write this review as is normal, and still dread committing it to print\". It has been highly praised in the years since. For the sociologist C. Wright Mills it was \"the best book I know\" on writing, for the academic Greg Myers, \"relentlessly prescriptive and hilarious\", for the journalist Mark Halperin \"one of the three or four books on usage that deserve a place on the same shelf as Fowler\". The biographer Miranda Seymour said that \"as a handbook to style, it has never been bettered\", and the literary critic Denis Donoghue wrote, \"I don't know any other book in which expository prose is read so seriously, carefully, helpfully. For this reason the book is just as important as I. A. Richards' \"Practical Criticism\"\". He went on, \"there is no point in being scandalized by the assumption in \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder\" that good English is the sort of English written by Graves and Hodge. In my opinion, that claim is justified.\"\n\nBy 1941 another project was in the offing alongside \"The Reader Over Your Shoulder\". This was intended as a volume of new poems by Hodge, Graves, James Reeves, Norman Cameron and Harry Kemp , all of whom were veterans of the Laura Riding circle. In the event the publisher, Hogarth Press, rejected Reeves and Kemp from this line-up, so when the book appeared in March 1942 it included 17 poems by Hodge alongside contributions by Graves and Cameron, \"published under a single cover for economy and friendship\", as the Authors' Note says. \"The Times Literary Supplement\" thought Hodge's poems showed \"an ironic humour...enriched by a spontaneous vivacity and a sympathetic closeness to nature\".\n\nOne more book was to have been a collaboration between Graves and Hodge. This was eventually published under Graves's name alone as \"The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth\". Hodge retired from the project at a fairly early stage, in 1943, as it became clear that this would be a very personal view of the nature of poetic inspiration and would go beyond his own areas of expertise. Of the central thesis of the book Hodge wrote, \"I think it is a good myth, that is, it has truth, and it is not necessary to ask whether it is entirely factually true\". They would not produce another book together again, and Graves began to recede from the foreground of Hodge's life.\n\nHodge spent the Second World War at the Ministry of Information, where he served first under Sir Harold Nicolson, then as Assistant Private Secretary to his successor, Brendan Bracken. In 1944 he added to his workload by taking a job as book-reviewer to the London local paper, the \"Evening Standard\". After the 1945 general election Bracken was out of office, and Hodge left with him, but when Bracken took on a gossip column called \"Men and Matters\" at the \"Financial Times\" in 1946 he appointed Hodge his assistant. According to Hodge's later description of his role as Bracken's literary catalyst he would be \"asked to produce a list of targets for attack. Invariably these were shot down by Bracken in withering terms. This was part of a process of warming up by which he got into his stride\". Not everyone reacted well to this kind of treatment – his civil servants cheered when he departed in 1945, and he is rumoured to have been in some respects the model for Orwell's Big Brother – but the relationship with Hodge was different, Bracken having a genuine fondness for him as well as a respect for his scholarship.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1952 Hodge worked for the publishing firm Hamish Hamilton as the general editor of their Novel Library, a series of reprints of classic novels, both English and foreign. The introductions with which Hodge furnished some of the volumes won the admiration of Raymond Chandler, who wrote to the publisher, \"Your man Hodge is a superb editor, the rarest kind of mind...Surely no one could write better introductions\". The series was eventually wrapped up, but Novel Library editions are now much sought after in secondhand bookshops. He also produced for Hamish Hamilton two translations from the French, \"Maigret's Mistake\" by Georges Simenon (later reprinted by Penguin) and \"Caves of Adventure\" by Haroun Tazieff.\n\nThe last 28 years of Hodge's life were dominated by his work on the magazine \"History Today\". This was the creation of Brendan Bracken, Hodge's old boss and from 1945 Chairman of the Financial News group which owned the \"Financial Times\". One of his projects was the creation of a monthly history magazine to be edited by Hodge, but when in 1950 he decided to act on this plan he brought in the literary biographer Peter Quennell as well, making the two men co-editors. Paper-rationing delayed the magazine's launch, but on 12 January 1951 the first issue appeared. \"History Today\" (the title was allegedly suggested by Winston Churchill) was attractively illustrated and aimed itself at the general reader without writing down to him. The intention, as A. L. Rowse later wrote, was to \"bridge the gap between specialist journals, all too often unreadable by the general public, and the intelligent reader who wanted to read history\". From the first the magazine brought in a wide range of heavyweight academic historians to contribute articles, the first two issues alone boasting the names of G. M. Trevelyan, G. M. Young, Veronica Wedgwood, Eric Linklater, Alan Bullock, A. J. P. Taylor, D. W. Brogan, G. D. H. Cole and Max Beloff. Later Hodge and Quennell brought in experts from a wide range of fields, including Kenneth Clark, Freya Stark, Nancy Mitford, Arthur Waley, Julian Huxley and Michael Grant. Hodge's editorial style was described as \"scholarly, imaginative and judicious\".\n\nWhile editing the magazine Hodge took up a prolonged side-activity, the editing of Winston Churchill's \"History of the English-Speaking Peoples\". Churchill had begun to work on this massive work during his \"wilderness years\", in 1932, and it was in proof by the time he re-entered the Cabinet in September 1939, at which point he had to lay it aside. In 1953, once again Prime Minister, he returned to the \"History\", uncertain whether it was in a publishable state. His close friend Bracken advised him to take on Hodge as an editorial assistant, the introductions were made, and Hodge soon found himself leading a team of historians advising Churchill on necessary revisions. His brief was to produce \"a lively, continuous narrative\" emphasizing \"famous dramatic events\", but getting major changes made in the text proved very difficult. \"Errors of fact were changed with courteous alacrity,\" according to the historian John H. Plumb; \"subject to strong pressure, an adjective might or might not be pruned, but the grand design proved immutable.\" Hodge worked in various places: at home, at the \"History Today\" offices, at Chartwell (Churchill's home in Kent), and in the south of France where Churchill spent lengthy holidays. They developed a close friendship, but the work came to an end at last in 1957.\n\nOne project suffered from Hodge's heavy workload in these years. When his old friend Norman Cameron died from a stroke in 1953 leaving Hodge his copyrights, Hodge agreed to prepare an edition of his poems with an introduction by Robert Graves. This edition hung fire for a long time, to Graves's increasing anger, but the \"Collected Poems\" finally appeared in June 1957.\n\nThe same year, having resigned as Prime Minister amid heavy press criticism of the Suez Crisis, Anthony Eden decided to write his memoirs as a way of giving his side of the story. He recruited a team of historians to assist him, and Bracken once more stepped forward to recommend Hodge for his \"grace of style and nicety of perspective\". Hodge joined the team, and was kept occupied through to 1959.\n\nIn 1958 Brendan Bracken died, and Hodge was commissioned to write his biography. He researched his subject diligently, but found himself hampered by the fact that Bracken had ordered his private papers to be burned after his death and also by a sense of loyalty to his old boss which would not have allowed him to publish everything he found. After several years he abandoned the task and gave his notes to Charles Lysaght and Andrew Boyle, both of whom were engaged on the same task.\n\nIn 1960 Hodge and Quennell collaborated on \"The Past We Share: An Illustrated History of the British and American Peoples\". Reviews were mixed. \"Kirkus Reviews\" called it \"a superb panoramic view of history with a somewhat misleading subtitle, for the emphasis is so largely British that the America aspects take definitely second place\", \"The New Yorker\" \"a more than ordinarily serious entry in a frequently trumped-up field\", and \"The Booklist and Subscription Books Bulletin\" \"an inviting historical summary for casual reading\",; the \"Times Literary Supplement\" found the illustrations good in themselves but inaccurately captioned, the \"New York Herald Tribune\" thought that \"the real past we share with the English was a broader, harsher, more dynamic and far more astonishing saga of conquest than this genteel survey suggests\", \"The New York Times\" that \"the luminous histories of our two peoples have not been dovetailed at all (as the title implied they would be) but rather set side by side to languish augustly in isolation from one another\", but the \"Chicago Sunday Tribune\" believed that \"this gallery of a pictured past is as rewarding as any the reader is likely to tour for some time\".\n\nAlan Hodge remained until his death the co-editor with Peter Quennell of \"History Today\". He died at the age of 63 on 25 May 1979.\n\nIn 1942 Hodge opened the way for his first wife, Beryl, to marry Graves by instituting divorce proceedings, and the divorce was made absolute the following year. In the autumn of 1947 he met Jane Aiken, daughter of the poet and novelist Conrad Aiken, and on 3 January 1948 they married. He encouraged her to begin her successful career writing Gothic romances. They lived in Wimbledon and later Lewes, and had two daughters, Jessica and Joanna.\n\n\n"}

He hosts \"The Alex Jones Show\" from Austin, Texas, which airs on the Genesis Communications Network across the United States and online. Jones runs a website, \"Infowars.com\", devoted to conspiracy theories and fake news, and the websites \"NewsWars\" and \"PrisonPlanet\".\n\nJones has been the center of many controversies, including his promotion of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories, and his aggressive opposition to gun control in a debate with Piers Morgan. He has accused the U.S. government of planning the Oklahoma City bombing, the September 11 attacks, and has claimed that the moon landing footage was fake. He has claimed that several governments and big businesses have colluded to create a \"New World Order\" through \"manufactured economic crises, sophisticated surveillance tech and—above all—inside-job terror attacks that fuel exploitable hysteria\".\n\nJones has described himself as a conservative, paleoconservative and libertarian, terms he uses interchangeably. Others describe him as conservative, right-wing, alt-right, and far-right. \"New York\" described Jones as \"America's leading conspiracy theorist\", and the Southern Poverty Law Center describes him as \"the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America\". Asked about such labels, Jones said he is \"proud to be listed as a thought criminal against Big Brother\".\n\nJones was born in 1974 in Dallas, Texas, and grew up in the Dallas suburb of Rockwall and the city of Austin, Texas. His father is a dentist and his mother a homemaker. In his video podcasts, he reports he is of Irish, German, Welsh, mostly English, and partially Native American descent. He was a lineman on his high school's football team and graduated from Anderson High School in Austin in 1993. As a teenager, he read conservative journalist and conspiracy theorist Gary Allen's anti-Semitic book \"None Dare Call It Conspiracy\", which had a profound influence on him and which he calls \"the easiest-to-read primer on The New World Order\". After high school, Jones briefly attended Austin Community College but dropped out.\n\nJones began his career in Austin with a live, call-in format public-access cable television program. In 1996, Jones switched format to radio, hosting a show named \"The Final Edition\" on KJFK (98.9 FM). Ron Paul was running for Congress and was a guest on his show several times. When the Oklahoma City bombing happened in 1995 Jones began accusing the government of being responsible, saying, \"I understood there's a kleptocracy working with psychopathic governments—clutches of evil that know the tricks of control\". In 1998, he released his first film, \"America Destroyed By Design\".\n\nIn 1998, Jones organized a successful effort to build a new Branch Davidian church, as a memorial to those who died during the 1993 fire that ended the government's siege of the original Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas. He often featured the project on his public-access television program and claimed that David Koresh and his followers were peaceful people who were murdered by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms during the siege. In the same year, he was removed from a George W. Bush rally at Bayport Industrial District, Texas. Jones interrupted governor Bush's speech, demanding that the Federal Reserve and Council on Foreign Relations be abolished. Journalist David Weigel, reporting on the incident, said Jones \"seemed to launch into public events as if flung from another universe.\"\n\nIn 1999, Jones tied with Shannon Burke for that year's \"Best Austin Talk Radio Host\" poll, as voted by \"The Austin Chronicle\" readers. Later that year, he was fired from KJFK-FM for refusing to broaden his topics. His views were making the show hard to sell to advertisers, according to the station's operations manager. Jones stated: It was purely political, and it came down from on high ... I was told 11 weeks ago to lay off [Bill] Clinton, to lay off all these politicians, to not talk about rebuilding the church, to stop bashing the Marines, A to Z. He began broadcasting his show by Internet connection from his home. In early 2000, Jones was one of seven Republican candidates for state representative in Texas House District 48, an open swing district based in Austin, Texas. Jones stated that he was running \"to be a watchdog on the inside\" but withdrew from the race after a couple of weeks. In July, a group of Austin Community Access Center (ACAC) programmers claimed that Jones used legal proceedings and ACAC policy to intimidate them or get their shows thrown off the air. On July 15, 2000, Jones infiltrated the \"Cremation of Care\", which he called \"a ritualistic shedding of conscience and empathy\" and an \"abuse of power\".\n\nIn 2001, his show was syndicated on approximately 100 stations. After the 9/11 attack, Jones began to speak of a conspiracy by the Bush administration as being behind the attack, which caused a number of the stations that had previously carried him to drop his program, according to Will Bunch.\nOn June 8, 2006, while on his way to cover a meeting of the Bilderberg Group in Ottawa, Jones was stopped and detained at the Ottawa airport by Canadian authorities who confiscated his passport, camera equipment, and most of his belongings. He was later allowed to enter Canada lawfully. Jones said about the reason for his immigration hold, \"I want to say, on the record, it takes two to tango. I could have handled it better.\"\n\nOn September 8, 2007, he was arrested while protesting at 6th Avenue and 48th Street in New York City. He was charged with operating a megaphone without a permit. Two others were also cited for disorderly conduct when his group crashed a live television show featuring Geraldo Rivera. In an article, one of Jones' fellow protesters said, \"It was ... guerrilla information warfare.\"\n\nOn June 6, 2013, Jones addressed international media for the annual Bilderberg conference in Watford, England. He gave an hour-long speech to around 2,000 protesters in the grounds of The Grove hotel, where he was \"rapturously welcomed\", \"surrounded by cameras and peppered with questions\".\n\nOn July 21, 2016, following the 2016 Republican National Convention, Jones and Roger Stone began plotting the removal of Ted Cruz from his Senate seat after he failed to endorse Donald Trump as the Republican presidential candidate, with potential challengers Katrina Pierson and Dan Patrick mooted as replacements in the upcoming Texas election for Senate in 2018.\n\nOn July 6, 2017, alongside Paul Joseph Watson, Jones began hosting a contest to create the best \"CNN Meme\", in which the winner would receive $20,000. The contest was created in response to CNN releasing an article regarding a Reddit user who had created a pro-Trump, anti-CNN meme.\n\nOn January 23, 2018, it was announced that Jones would be working with author Neil Strauss on his upcoming book, titled \"The Secret History of the Modern World & the War for the Future\".\n\nIn February 2018, Jones was accused by two former employees of antisemitism, anti-black racism and sexual harassment of males and females. Jones denied the allegations.\n\n\"The Alex Jones Show\" is broadcast nationally by the Genesis Communications Network to more than 90 AM and FM radio stations in the United States, including WWCR, a shortwave radio station. The Sunday show also airs on KLBJ. In 2010, the show attracted around 2 million listeners each week.\n\nAccording to journalist Will Bunch, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, the show has a demographic heavier in younger viewers than other conservative pundits due to Jones's \"highly conspiratorial tone and Web-oriented approach\". Bunch has also stated that Jones \"feed[s] on the deepest paranoia\". According to Alexander Zaitchik of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, in 2011 he had a larger on-line audience than Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh combined.\n\nJones is the publisher and director of the Infowars.com website. The \"Infowars\" website receives approximately 10 million monthly visits, making its reach more extensive than mainstream news websites such as \"The Economist\" and \"Newsweek\".\nIn August 2017, Jones announced the launch of NewsWars.com, a site Jones said was intended to battle news that he considers to be fake news.\n\nJones also operates the PrisonPlanet.com website.\n\nA 2017 piece for German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" by Veit Medick indicated that two-thirds of Jones' funds derive from sales of a successful range of his own products. These products are marketed through the \"Infowars\" website and through advertising spots on Jones' show. They include dietary supplements, toothpaste, bulletproof vests and \"brain pills,\" which hold \"an appeal for anyone who believes Armageddon is near\", according to Medick.\n\nIn August 2017, Californian medical company Labdoor, Inc reported on tests applied to six of Jones' dietary supplement products. These included a product named Survival Shield, which was found by Labdoor to contain only iodine, and a product named Oxy-Powder, which comprised a compound of magnesium oxide and citric acid; common ingredients in dietary supplements. Labdoor indicated no evidence of prohibited or harmful substances, but cast doubt on Infowars' marketing claims for these products, and asserted that the quantity of the ingredients in certain products would be \"too low to be appropriately effective\".\n\nOn a segment of \"Last Week Tonight\", host John Oliver stated that Jones spends \"nearly a quarter\" of his on-air time promoting products sold on his website, many of which are purported solutions to medical and economic problems claimed to be caused by the conspiracy theories described on his show.\n\nMainstream sources have described Jones as a conservative, far-right, alt-right, and a conspiracy theorist. Jones has described himself as a libertarian and a paleoconservative. He indicated his support for Donald Trump during the Presidential campaign in 2016 also denouncing Trump's rival Hillary Clinton (\"Hillary for prison!\") and Barack Obama.\n\nJones is a vocal gun rights advocate. MTV have labeled him a \"staunch Second Amendment supporter\", while the London \"Daily Telegraph\" called him a \"gun-nut\". He has been widely quoted in international media for claiming, in a debate with Piers Morgan, that \"1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms\". Jones was referencing the American Revolutionary War in relation to theoretical gun control measures taken by the government. He has been reported to own around 50 firearms.\n\nJones is well-known and widely reported in media for both his opposition to vaccines, and his views on vaccine controversies. On June 16, 2017, \"Vox\" covered his claim that the introduction of the \"Sesame Street\" character Julia, an autistic Muppet, was \"designed to normalize autism, a disorder caused by vaccines.\" On November 20, 2017, \"The New Yorker\" quoted Jones as claiming \"Infowars\" was \"defending people's right to not be forcibly infected with vaccines\". \"ThinkProgress\" have declared that he \"continues to endanger children by convincing their parents that vaccines are dangerous.\" Jones has specifically disputed the safety and effectiveness of MMR vaccines.\n\n\"Mother Jones\" has claimed that Jones is a believer in weather weapons, and \"Salon\" has covered his claim \"that the president has access to weather weapons capable of not only creating tornadoes but also moving them around, on demand\". His belief in weather warfare has been reported by mainstream media. He has claimed that Hurricane Irma may have been geo-engineered.\n\nJones has promoted the white genocide conspiracy theory. \"Media Matters\" covered his claim that NFL players protesting during the national anthem were \"kneeling to white genocide\" and violence against whites, which the SPLC featured in their headlines review. On October 2, 2017, Jones claimed that Democrats and communists were plotting imminent \"white genocide\" attacks. His reporting and public views on the topic have received support and coverage from white nationalist publications and groups, such as AltRight.com and the New Zealand National Front.\n\nJones has been the center of many controversies. He has accused the United States government of being involved in the Oklahoma City bombing and the September 11 attacks, as well as claiming that two school shootings were \"false flag\" operations. In 2009, Jones claimed that a convicted con man's scheme to take over a long-vacant, would-be for-profit prison in Hardin, Montana was part of a FEMA plot to detain U.S. citizens in concentration camps. Jones was in a \"media crossfire\" in 2011, which included criticism by Rush Limbaugh, when the news spread that Jared Lee Loughner, the perpetrator of the 2011 Tucson shooting, had been \"a fan\" of the 9/11 conspiracy film \"Loose Change\" of which Jones had been an executive producer.\n\nHis website \"Infowars.com\" has been described as a fake news website and has been accused of spreading conspiracy theories.\n\nJones has been criticized for propagating conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 and the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018 being false flag operations engineered by gun control advocates. In particular, he has stated that \"no one died\" in Sandy Hook and that Stoneman Douglas survivor David Hogg was a crisis actor. Claims made in support of these theories have been proven false.\n\nIn March 2018, six families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as well as an FBI agent who responded to the attack filed a defamation lawsuit against Jones for his role in spreading conspiracy theories about the shooting.\n\nIn January 2013, Jones was invited to speak on Piers Morgan's show after promoting an online petition to deport Morgan because of his support of gun control laws. The interview turned into \"a one-person shoutfest, as Jones riffed about guns, oppressive government, the flag, his ancestors' role in Texan independence, and what flag Morgan would have on his tights if they wrestled.\" The event drew widespread coverage, and according to \"The Huffington Post\", Morgan and others such as Glenn Beck \"agreed that Jones was a terrible spokesman for gun rights\". Jones's appearance on the show was a top trending Twitter topic the following morning.\n\nOn June 9, 2013, Jones appeared as a guest on the BBC's television show \"Sunday Politics\", during a discussion about conspiracy theories surrounding the Bilderberg Group meetings with presenter Andrew Neil and journalist David Aaronovitch. A critic of such theories, Aaronovitch implied that, since Jones had not been killed for exposing conspiracies, they either do not exist or that Jones is a part of them himself. Jones began shouting and interrupting, and Andrew Neil ended the interview, describing Jones as \"an idiot\" and \"the worst person I've ever interviewed\". According to Neil on Twitter, Jones was still shouting until he knew that he was off-air.\n\nIn December 2015, Jones initially \"formed a bond\" with Donald Trump, after the presidential candidate appeared on \"The Alex Jones Show\", with Trump stating \"Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\" During the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton criticized Trump for his ties to Jones. Jones said that Trump called him on the day after the election to thank him for his help in the campaign. Since Trump took office, it has been claimed Jones communicates with the President through aides, something which Chief of Staff John Kelly had reportedly tried to block. In June 2017, journalist and commentator Bill Moyers wrote that Trump and Jones explicitly \"operate as a tag team\". In April 2018, Jones publicly criticized President Trump during a livestream, after Trump announced a military strike against Syria. During the stream, Jones also stated that Trump had not called him during the prior six months.\n\nIn February 2017, the lawyers of James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, sent Jones a letter demanding an apology and retraction for his role in pushing the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. Under Texas law, Jones was given a month to comply or be subject to a libel suit. In March 2017, Alex Jones apologized to Alefantis for promulgating the conspiracy theory and retracted his allegations.\n\nIn April 2017, the Chobani yogurt company filed a lawsuit against Jones for his article that claims that the company's factory in Idaho, which employs refugees, was connected to a 2016 child sexual assault and a rise in tuberculosis cases. As a result of the lawsuit, Jones issued an apology and retraction of his allegations in May 2017.\n\nIn March 2018, Brennan Gilmore, who shared a video he captured of a car hitting anti-racism protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, filed a lawsuit against Jones and six others. According to the lawsuit, Jones said that Gilmore was acting as part of a false flag operation conducted by disgruntled government \"deep state\" employees in furtherance of a coup against President Trump. Gilmore alleges he has been receiving death threats from Jones' audience.\n\nIn April 2017, Jones was criticized for claiming that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack was a hoax and a \"false flag\". Jones stated that the attack was potentially carried out by civil defense group White Helmets, which he claims are an Al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist front financed by George Soros.\n\nOn July 24, 2018, YouTube removed four of InfoWars' videos citing \"long-standing policies against child endangerment and hate speech\", and issued a \"strike\" against the Infowars channel. YouTube also suspended the channel's ability to live stream. On July 27, 2018, Facebook suspended Jones's profile for 30 days, and also removed the same videos, saying they violated Facebook's standards against hate speech and bullying. On August 3, 2018, Stitcher Radio removed all of his podcasts stating that he was involved in harassment or encouraged it.\n\nOn August 6, 2018, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify removed all content by Alex Jones and Infowars from their platforms for violating their policies. YouTube removed various channels associated with Infowars, including The Alex Jones Channel, which had amassed 2.4 million subscriptions prior to its removal. On Facebook, four pages that were associated with InfoWars and Alex Jones were removed due to repeated violations of the website's policies. Apple removed all podcasts associated with Jones from its iTunes platform and its podcast app. On August 13, 2018, Vimeo removed all of Jones' videos because they \"violated our terms of service prohibitions on discriminatory and hateful content\". Facebook mentioned that dehumanizing language about immigrants, Muslims and transgender people, as well as violence glorification, were among the hate speech policy violations.\n\nJones' accounts have also been removed from Pinterest, MailChimp and LinkedIn. As of early August 2018, Jones still had active accounts on Instagram, Google+ and Twitter. Jones tweeted a Periscope video calling on others \"to get their battle rifles ready against antifa, the mainstream media, and Chicom operatives\". In the video he also says, \"Now is time to act on the enemy before they do a false flag.\" Twitter cited this as the reason to suspend his account for a week on August 14. On September 6, 2018, Jones was permanently banned from Twitter and Periscope after confronting and berating CNN reporter Oliver Darcy. On September 7, 2018, the Infowars app was removed from the Apple App Store for \"objectionable content\". He was banned from using PayPal for his business transactions, with PayPal citing \"instances that promoted hate or discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions, which run counter to our core value of inclusion,\" in their announcement.\n\nJones has three children with ex-wife Kelly Jones. The couple divorced in March 2015. In 2017, Kelly sought sole or joint custody of their children due to her ex-husband's behavior. She claimed \"he's not a stable person\" and \"I'm concerned that he is engaged in felonious behavior, threatening a member of Congress\" (Adam Schiff). His attorney responded by claiming that \"he's playing a character\" and describing him as a \"performance artist\". In court, Jones denied playing a character and he called his show \"the most bona fide, hard-core, real McCoy thing there is, and everybody knows it\". Kelly was awarded the right to decide where their children live while he maintains visitation rights.\n\nHis son, Rex Jones, has worked for \"Infowars\", receiving media attention for a video which was critical of gun control and BuzzFeed News. Jones has credited Rex for convincing him to support Donald Trump as a presidential candidate.\n\n\n"}

He was the originator of horsemanship acts and proprietor of Astley's Amphitheatre . Ducrow was trained by his father who had immigrated to England from Belgium in 1793. The \"Courier of St. Petersburg\", his most famous act, was the forerunner to modern horse acts and is still performed today at equestrian events.\n\nDucrow performed within the United Kingdom and in Europe, including in famous venues such as Covent Garden and Drury Lane. He is most famous as the proprietor of Astley’s Amphitheatre, where he was also the chief performer. Referred to by some as \"the Chippendales of his day,\" Ducrow and his sons would dress in \"fleshings\" (flesh-coloured body stockings) and would perform physique poses posed as plastiques while standing upon the rumps of white stallions which could carry them round the amphitheatre several times. \n\nPablo Fanque, the black circus equestrian and later circus owner, best known from his mention in The Beatles song \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" on the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, worked in Ducrow's circus for some time.\n\nDucrow's shows proved immensely popular. Unfortunately, the Amphitheatre succumbed three times to fire. After the third time in 1841, Ducrow collapsed from a mental breakdown and died shortly thereafter in 1842. William Batty took over management of Astley's Amphitheatre and an employee of Ducrow called Joseph Hillier took over Ducrow's circus company. \n\nDucrow is buried on the Main (or Centre) Avenue at Kensal Green Cemetery in London, England, one of the most desirable burial plots of the time. His tomb is one of the largest and most decorated tombs within the cemetery. The decoration is primarily pagan, being drawn from Greek and Egyptian sources. There is no Christian-inspired decoration. The tomb was designed by Ducrow's theatrical designer and originally was brightly painted in pastel hues to attract the eye. These have faded over time.\n\n\n"}

She was the only woman among the casualties of the Old Location uprising in Windhoek on 10 December 1959. Since Namibia's independence on 21 March 1990 Mungunda is regarded one of the heroes of the Namibian nation.\n\nMungunda was born in 1932 to migrant labourer Theopoldt Shivute and Emilia Kavezeri, a niece of Hosea Kutako. She had three siblings who all died in their infancy.\n\nSources disagree on what exactly happened to Mungunda, who was employed as a domestic worker, on the day of the Old Location uprising. It is reported that the fatal shooting of her only son, Kaaronda Mungunda, enraged her so much that she ran towards the car of a high-ranking administrator, poured petrol over it, and set it alight. The car either belonged to mayor Jaap Snyman or to Old Location Police Superintendent de Wet. Both cars were set alight during the demonstration. She was shot dead during or immediately after this action.\n\nAnna Mungunda is one of nine national heroes of Namibia that were identified at the inauguration of the country's Heroes' Acre near Windhoek. Founding president Sam Nujoma remarked in his inauguration speech on 26 August 2002 that:\n\nOn that fateful day [of the Old Location uprising], twelve peaceful demonstrators were killed and more than fifty others were injured. In the face of this brutality, a courageous and fearless young woman by the name of Kakurukaze Mungunda demonstrated her bravery and heroism by setting alight the car of De Wet who was the superintendent of the Windhoek Old Location. She was shot on the spot and Killed in cold blood by the South African apartheid repressive police. To her revolutionary spirit and his visionary memory we humbly offer our honour and respect.\n\nMungunda is honoured in form of a granite tombstone with her name engraved and her portrait plastered onto the slab.\n"}

His father was the Rector of Lamorran, a keen gardener of (it was said) one of the finest gardens in Cornwall. His uncle was Evelyn Boscawen, 6th Viscount Falmouth who was developing the garden on his estate at Tregothnan.\n\nBoscawen married at St Andrew's Church, Plymouth, on 2 September 1902, Christian Anna E Chapell-Hodge (1866– 13 November 1940), eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs Chapell-Hodge of Plymouth. They had two daughters:\n\nHe initially considered the army for a career but opted for the church, and following a short period working in the Diocese of Bristol he was based at Buckland Monachorum, Devon for five years before moving to Ludgvan in 1893. In 1917 Boscawen had the rank of Temporary Chaplain to the Forces, of the 1st Battalion, Cornwall Volunteers Regiment. In 1933 he was appointed canon of Truro Cathedral and was also a Justice of the Peace.\n\nThe garden of the Rectory, in Ludgvan, was first laid out by William Borlase when he was the rector in 1722. He planned to grow exotic species sent to him by his uncle who was a captain in the service of the East India Company in Bengal, India. Boscawen had similar plans and was sent trees and shrubs from New Zealand. Material for the garden was provided by some of New Zealand's botanists, including Thomas Cheeseman, and by his eldest brother, John Hugh Boscawen who was employed by the New Zealand Forest Service. There was also a network between local gardens and gardeners with the transfer of plants and seeds. These included Arthur Dorrien-Smith's garden at Tresco, Morrab Gardens and Penlee Park in Penzance and Eagles Nest, Zennor. Little of the original garden survives, the three winters of 1938, 1939 and 1940 were severe and many of the more tender trees and shrubs were killed, although some of the planting remains including the palms (\"Trachycarpus fortunei\"), the tallest measuring tall. Boscawen did not leave a list of his plantings but research by Anne Boscawen shows that there were 290 acquisitions of plants. Boscawen also introduced many new plants to the botanical garden at Tregothnan.\n\nBoscawen spent much of his time on the propagation of shrubs from cuttings and seeds. In 1912 he was awarded a Gold Medal and The Gardeners' Chronicle Cup for New Plants for varieties of New Zealand manukas' (\"Leptospermum scoparium\" var Nichollsii). A variety of daffodil was named, ″Karenza (Cornish for love) was named after his second daughter and a second variety was named ″Ludgvan″. Both varieties appear to be no longer available. It is thought that Boscawen collected seeds of \"Anemome\" while on holiday in the Mediterranean and in 1925 gave of white, woolly seeds to the nearby Gulval Experimental Station. The first commercial crop was despatched to Covent Garden which filled a gap in the farming year between cauliflower and \"narcissi\". Cauliflower is known as broccoli in Cornwall and he helped local production by introducing seed from Bavaria, to improve the local varieties.\n\nHe was awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour in 1922 by the Royal Horticultural Society.\n\nArthur Townsend Boscawen died 17 July 1939 at the Rectory and is buried at the Church of St Paul, Ludgvan. There is a monument to him inside the church.\n\n"}

He was the husband of former Philippine President Corazon Aquino and father of former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III. Aquino, together with Gerardo Roxas and Jovito Salonga, formed the leadership of the opposition towards then President Ferdinand Marcos. Shortly after the imposition of martial law, he was arrested in 1972 along with others associated with the Communists' armed insurgency and incarcerated for seven years. He founded his own party, Lakas ng Bayan, and ran in the 1978 Philippine parliamentary election, but all of the party's candidates, including Aquino, lost in the election. In 1980, Aquino was permitted by Marcos to travel to the United States for medical treatment following a heart attack. He was assassinated at the Manila International Airport in 1983 upon returning from his self-imposed exile. His death catapulted his widow, Corazon, into the political limelight, and prompted her to run for president as member of the UNIDO party in the 1986 snap elections.\n\nAmong other public structures, Manila International Airport has since been renamed Ninoy Aquino International Airport in his honor, and the anniversary of his death is a national holiday.\n\nBenigno Simeón Aquino Jr. was born in Concepcion, Tarlac, on November 27, 1932, to Benigno Aquino Sr. and Aurora Lampa Aquino from a prosperous family of \"hacienderos\", the original owners of Hacienda Maling, Hacienda Sawang and Hacienda Murcia.\n\nHis grandfather, Aquino, was a general in the revolutionary army of Emilio Aguinaldo, the officially recognized first President of the Philippines.\n\nHe received his elementary education at the basic education department of De La Salle College and finished at the basic education department of Saint Joseph's College of Quezon City. He then graduated at the high school department of San Beda College. Aquino took his tertiary education at Ateneo de Manila University to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree, but he interrupted his studies. According to one of his biographies, he considered himself to be an average student; his grade was not in the line of 90s nor did it fall into the 70s. At age 17, he was the youngest war correspondent to cover the Korean War for \"The Manila Times\" of \"Don\" Joaquín \"Chino\" Roces. Because of his journalistic feats, he received the Philippine Legion of Honor award from President Elpidio Quirino at age 18. At 21, he became a close adviser to then Defense Secretary Ramon Magsaysay. Aquino took up law at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he became a member of Upsilon Sigma Phi, the same fraternity as Ferdinand Marcos. He interrupted his studies again however to pursue a career in journalism. According to Máximo Soliven, Aquino \"later 'explained' that he had decided to go to as many schools as possible, so that he could make as many new friends as possible.\" In early 1954, he was appointed by President Ramon Magsaysay, his wedding sponsor to his 1953 wedding at the Our Lady of Sorrows Church in Pasay with Corazon Cojuangco, to act as personal emissary to Luis Taruc, leader of the Hukbalahap rebel group. After four months of negotiations, he was credited for Taruc's unconditional surrender and was given a second Philippine Legion of Honor award with the degree of Commander on October 14, 1954.\n\nHe became mayor of Concepcion in 1955 at the age of 22.\n\nAquino gained an early familiarity with Philippine politics, as he was born into one of the Philippines' political and landholding clans. His grandfather served under President Aguinaldo, and his father held office under Presidents Quezon and Jose P. Laurel. As a consequence, Aquino was able to be elected mayor when he was 23 years old. Five years later, he was elected the nation's youngest vice-governor at 27 (the record was surpassed by Jolo Revilla at 25 in 2013). Two years later, he became governor of Tarlac province in 1961 and then secretary-general of the Liberal Party in 1966. \n\nIn 1968, during his first year as senator, Aquino alleged that Marcos was on the road to establishing \"a garrison state\" by \"ballooning the armed forces budget,\" saddling the defense establishment with \"overstaying generals\" and \"militarizing our civilian government offices.\"\n\nAquino became known as a constant critic of the Marcos regime, as his flamboyant rhetoric had made him a darling of the media. His most polemical speech, \"A Pantheon for Imelda\", was delivered on February 10, 1969. He assailed the Cultural Center, the first project of First Lady Imelda Marcos as extravagant, and dubbed it \"a monument to shame\" and labelled its designer \"a megalomaniac, with a penchant to captivate\". By the end of the day, the country's broadsheets had blared that he labelled the President's wife, his cousin Paz's former ward, and a woman he had once courted, \"the Philippines' Eva Peron\". President Marcos is said to have been outraged and labelled Aquino \"a congenital liar\". The First Lady's friends angrily accused Aquino of being \"ungallant\". These so-called \"fiscalization\" tactics of Aquino quickly became his trademark in the Senate.\n\nIt was not until the Plaza Miranda bombing however on August 21, 1971 that the pattern of direct confrontation between Marcos and Aquino emerged. At 9:15 pm, at the kick-off rally of the Liberal Party, the candidates had formed a line on a makeshift platform and were raising their hands as the crowd applauded. The band played, a fireworks display drew all eyes, when suddenly there were two loud explosions that obviously were not part of the show. In an instant the stage became a scene of wild carnage. The police later discovered two fragmentation grenades that had been thrown at the stage by \"unknown persons\". Eight people died, and 120 others were wounded, many critically.\n\nAs Aquino was the only Liberal Party senatorial candidate not present at the incident, many assumed that Aquino's NPA friends tipped him off in advance. Years later, some former Communists claimed responsibility and accused Aquino of being involved, but the party leadership has dismissed this as absurd. No one has ever been prosecuted for the attack. Most historians continue to suspect Marcos as he is known to have used false flag attacks as a pretext for his declaration of martial law at this time.\n\nMarcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972 through proclamation 1081 and he went on air to broadcast his declaration on midnight of September 23. Aquino was one of the first to be arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion. He was tried before Military Commission No. 2 headed by Major-General Jose Syjuco.\n\nOn April 4, 1975, Aquino announced that he was going on a hunger strike, a fast to the death to protest the injustices of his military trial. Ten days through his hunger strike, he instructed his lawyers to withdraw all motions he had submitted to the Supreme Court. As weeks went by, he subsisted solely on salt tablets, sodium bicarbonate, amino acids, and two glasses of water a day. Even as he grew weaker, suffering from chills and cramps, soldiers forcibly dragged him to the military tribunal's session. His family and hundreds of friends and supporters heard Mass nightly at the Santuario de San Jose in Greenhills, San Juan, praying for his survival. Near the end, Aquino's weight had dropped from 54 to 36 kilos. Aquino nonetheless was able to walk throughout his ordeal. On May 13, 1975, on the 40th day, his family and several priests and friends, begged him to end his fast, pointing out that even Christ fasted only for 40 days. He acquiesced, confident that he had made a symbolic gesture. But he remained in prison, and the trial continued, drawn out for several years. On November 25, 1977, the Military Commission charged Aquino along with NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, guilty of all charges and sentenced them to death by firing squad. The death sentence was never carried out as Aquino's death sentence was commuted by President Marcos in May 1980.\n\nIn 1978, from his prison cell, Aquino was allowed to run in the Philippine parliamentary election, 1978. As Ninoy's liberal party colleagues were boycotting the election, he formed the party \"Lakas ng Bayan\". The party had 21 candidates for the Metro Manila area, including Ninoy himself. All of the party's candidates, including Ninoy, lost in the election.\n\nIn mid-March 1980, Aquino suffered a heart attack, mostly in a solitary cell. He was transported to the Philippine Heart Center, where he suffered a second heart attack. ECG and other tests showed that he had a blocked artery. Philippine surgeons were reluctant to do a coronary bypass, because it could involve them in a controversy. In addition, Aquino refused to submit himself to Philippine doctors, fearing possible Marcos \"duplicity\"; he preferred to go to the United States for the procedure or return to his cell at Fort Bonifacio and die.\n\nHis request was granted and Ninoy was allowed to go to the US for surgery, together with his entire family. This was arranged after a secret hospital visit by Imelda Marcos. This \"emergency leave\" was set when Ninoy supposedly agreed to the First Lady's 2 conditions: that if he leaves, he will return; and while in America, he should not speak out against the Marcos regime. Ninoy was operated in Dallas, Texas by Rolando M. Solis, a Filipino American, and the longest practicing Cardioligiat in Dallas currently. After the Surgery, Ninoy made a quick recovery. After which, he decided to renounce the agreement saying, \"a pact with the devil is no pact at all\".\n\nHe, Cory and their children started a new life in Massachusetts. He continued to work on two books and gave a series of lectures while on fellowship grants from Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His travels across the US had become opportunities for him to deliver speeches critical of the Marcos government. Throughout his years of expatriation, Aquino was always aware that his life in the U.S. was temporary. He never stopped affirming his eventual return even as he enjoyed American hospitality and a peaceful life with his family on American soil. After spending 7 years and 7 months in prison, Aquino's finances were in ruins. Making up for the lost time as the family's breadwinner, he toured America; attending symposiums, lectures, and giving speeches in freedom rallies opposing the Marcos dictatorship. The most memorable was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theater in Los Angeles, California on February 15, 1981.\n\nIn the first quarter of 1983, Aquino received news about the deteriorating political situation in his country and the rumored declining health of President Marcos (due to lupus). He believed that it was expedient for him to speak to Marcos and present to him his rationale for the country's return to democracy, before extremists took over and made such a change impossible. Moreover, his years of absence made his allies worry that the Filipinos might have resigned themselves to Marcos' strongman rule and that without his leadership the centrist opposition would die a natural death.\n\nAquino decided to go back to the Philippines, fully aware of the dangers that awaited him. Warned that he would either be imprisoned or killed, Aquino answered, \"if it's my fate to die by an assassin's bullet, so be it. But I cannot be petrified by inaction, or fear of assassination, and therefore stay in the side...\" His family, however, learned from a Philippine Consular official that there were orders from Ministry of Foreign Affairs not to issue any passports for them. At that time, their passports had expired and their renewal had been denied. They therefore formulated a plan for Aquino to fly alone (to attract less attention), with the rest of the family to follow him after two weeks. Despite the government's ban on issuing him a passport, Aquino acquired one with the help of Rashid Lucman, a former Mindanao legislator and founder of the Bangsamoro Liberation Front, a Moro separatist group against Marcos. It carried the alias \"Marcial Bonifacio\" (Marcial for martial law and Bonifacio for Fort Bonifacio, his erstwhile prison). He eventually obtained a legitimate passport from a sympathizer working in a Philippine consulate through the help of Roque R. Ablan Jr, then a Congressman. The Marcos government warned all international airlines that they would be denied landing rights and forced to return if they tried to fly Aquino to the Philippines. Aquino insisted that it was his natural right as a citizen to come back to his homeland, and that no government could prevent him from doing so. He left Logan International Airport on August 13, 1983, took a circuitous route home from Boston, via Los Angeles to Singapore. In Singapore, then Tunku Ibrahim Ismail of Johor met Aquino upon his arrival in Singapore and later brought him to Johor to meet with other Malaysian leaders. Once in Johor, Aquino met up with Tunku Ibrahim's father, Sultan Iskandar, who was a close friend to Aquino.\n\nHe then left for Hong Kong and on to Taipei. He had chosen Taipei as the final stopover when he learned the Philippines had severed diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan). This made him feel more secure; the Taiwan government could pretend they were not aware of his presence. There would also be a couple of Taiwanese friends accompanying him. From Taipei he flew to Manila on then Taiwan's flag carrier China Airlines Flight 811.\n\nMarcos wanted Aquino to stay out of politics, however Aquino asserted his willingness to suffer the consequences declaring, \"the Filipino is worth dying for.\" He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at an interview in his suite at the Taipei Grand Hotel, he revealed that he would be wearing a bullet-proof vest, but he also said that \"it's only good for the body, but in the head there's nothing else we can do.\" Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, \"You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [laughing] I may not be able to talk to you again after this.\" His last televised interview, with journalist Jim Laurie, took place on the flight just prior to his assassination.\n\nIn his last formal statement that he was not able to deliver, he said, \"I have returned on my free will to join the ranks of those struggling to restore our rights and freedoms through non-violence. I seek no confrontation.\"\n\nAquino was assassinated on August 21, 1983, when he was shot in the head after returning to the country. At the time, bodyguards were assigned to him by the Marcos government. A subsequent investigation produced controversy but with no definitive results. After Marcos' government was overthrown, another investigation found sixteen defendants guilty. They were all sentenced to life in prison. Some were released over the years, the last ones in March 2009.\n\nAnother man present at the airport tarmac, Rolando Galman, was shot dead shortly after Aquino was killed. The Marcos government claimed Galman was the trigger man in Aquino's assassination.\n\nAfter the assassination, the opposition ran for the Regular Batasang Pambansa under the United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO) and the Partido Demokratikong Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-LABAN) against the ruling Kilusang Bagong Lipunan of Ferdinand Marcos. In the wake of the massive outpouring of protest and discontent following the assassination of Ninoy, the opposition performed better during the Philippine parliamentary election, 1984 compared to the Philippine parliamentary election, 1978, winning 61 seats out of 183 seats or 33%. Many Filipinos considered his death as the best thing that happened in the history of the Philippines.\n\nAquino's body lay in state in a coffin. No effort was made to disguise a bullet wound that had disfigured his face. In an interview with Aquino's mother, Aurora, she told the funeral parlor not to apply makeup nor embalm her son, to see \"what they did to my son\". Thousands of supporters flocked to see the bloodied body of Aquino, which took place at the Aquino household in Times Street, West Triangle, Quezon City, for nine days. Aquino's wife, Corazon Aquino, and children Ballsy, Pinky, Viel, Noynoy and Kris arrived the day after the assassination. Aquino's funeral procession on August 31 lasted from 9 a.m., when his funeral mass was held at Santo Domingo Church in Santa Mesa Heights, Quezon City, with the Cardinal Archbishop of Manila, Jaime Sin officiating, to 9 p.m., when his body was interred at the Manila Memorial Park. More than two million people lined the streets during the procession which was aired by the Church-sponsored Radio Veritas, the only station to do so. The procession reached Rizal Park, where the Philippine flag was brought to half-staff.\n\nJovito Salonga, then head of the Liberal Party, referred to Aquino as \"the greatest president we never had\", adding:\nNinoy was getting impatient in Boston, he felt isolated by the flow of events in the Philippines. In early 1983, Marcos was seriously ailing, the Philippine economy was just as rapidly declining, and insurgency was becoming a serious problem. Ninoy thought that by coming home he might be able to persuade Marcos to restore democracy and somehow revitalize the Liberal Party.\n\nAlthough Aquino was recognized as the most prominent and most dynamic politician of his generation, in the years prior to martial law he was regarded by many as being a representative of the entrenched familial elite which to this day dominates Philippine politics. While atypically telegenic and uncommonly articulate, he had his share of detractors and was not known to be immune to ambitions and excesses of the ruling political class. However, during his seven years and seven months imprisoned as a criminal, Aquino read the book \"Born Again\" by convicted Watergate conspirator Charles Colson and it inspired him to a rude awakening.\n\nAs a result, the remainder of his personal and political life had a distinct spiritual sheen. He emerged as a contemporary counterpart of Jose Rizal, who was among the most vocal proponents of the use of non-violence to combat a repressive regime at the time, following the model of Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Some remained skeptical of Aquino's redirected spiritual focus and they were right, but it ultimately had an effect on his wife's political ambition. While some may question the prominence given Aquino in Philippine history, it was his assassination that was pivotal to the eventual restoration of constitutional democracy in the Philippines.\n\nThe Manila International Airport (MIA) where he was assassinated was renamed Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) and his image is printed on the 500-peso note. August 21, the anniversary of his death, is Ninoy Aquino Day, an annual public holiday in the Philippines. Several monuments were built because of their demands to be honored. Most renowned is the bronze memorial in Makati City near the Philippine Stock Exchange, which has become a popular venue for anti-government rallies and large demonstrations. Another bronze statue is in front of the Municipal Building of Concepcion, Tarlac.\n\nNational Honor\n\nOn October 11, 1954, he married Corazon Sumulong Cojuangco (Cory), with whom he had five children:\n\nIn a June 1981 interview with Pat Robertson on \"The 700 Club\", Aquino said he was raised Catholic. According to him, his religious awakening began after reading Evangelical Christian author Charles Colson's 1976 book \"Born Again\", during his solitary confinement under the Marcos regime.\n\n"}

{"id": "56695317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56695317", "title": "Bray Wilkins", "text": "Bray Wilkins\n\nBray Wilkins ( 1610 – 1/2 January 1702) was a Welsh immigrant, patriarch, and founder of Middleton, Massachusetts. Bray's origins aren't concretely known and are supplanted (and probably distorted) by familial tradition, however his reputation was already prolific in the Massachusetts Bay Colony decades before his death. His progeny, the Wilkins family, had a strong presence in the area. Bray and his seed were prominent figures in some Salem Witch Trials.\n\nOn a broad scale, Bray Wilkins' history is somewhat known. Bray was probably a descendant of Robert de Wintona, one of the men who captured Wales for the Norman people alongside Robert FitzHamon in the mid-11th century. Robert became the lord over Llandow and Llanblethian, in the latter of which he built a large manor which housed his descendants for some years. His great-grandson, Wilkyne de Winton, is the first attestation of what would become the surname 'Wilkins'. Over time, the by-names of Robert's descendants became corrupted, eventually forming surnames such as Wilcolyne, Wilkyn, Wilkin, and ultimately, Wilkins.\n\nThat being said, Bray's immediate origins aren't completely known. Family tradition places his birth in Glamorganshire on 16 October 1610, as the son of Thomas John Willkins and Hannah Nichols. However, there are no (surviving) records supporting these conclusions. It is known from his own admission and other records which required such information that Bray was born in 1610 in Wales. Where in Wales he was born is up for debate, it is sometimes suggested he was born in Brecknockshire and a descendant of the lord John Wilkins, who married the sister of Oliver Cromwell. While the Brecknockshire claims are up in the air, Bray was certainly not a descendant of the union of John Wilkins and Robina Cromwell, mainly because John Wilkins was actually born more than four years after Bray.\n\nRegardless of his origins, Bray arrived in the Thirteen Colonies around 1630, his first residence being recorded as Lynn, Massachusetts. He is first mentioned in a parchment dated January 16, 1632 which describes the allotment of 16 acres of Dorchester to him. He is registered as have taken the Oath of a Freeman on May 14, 1634.\n\nBray was known by the community as a model citizen: upright, pious, and adored. In 1659, Bray and his partner John Gengell (of uncertain relations, see below) leased 700 acres of land eight to ten miles northwest of Salem, which became the town of Danvers, and later Middleton. A controversial mortgage claim lead to Bray and Gengell being brought to court in 1666.\n\nIn 1689, Bray and his family, along with several others, moved from Salem proper to establish a church in Danvers. Around 1690, Bray's granddaughter by his son Thomas, Margaret, married a man by the name of John Willard. Willard acted as a constable for the court, and given Bray's legal misfortunes decades prior, the family disapproved of him immediately after it was announced Margaret and John were eloped. The two lived a rather normal life for several years, all the while the Wilkins family did not shy away from making it known how they disapproved of John. During the first weeks of the Salem Witch Trials in spring 1692, paranoia and mania swept through Danvers. Willard, being a constable, found he at times was to arrest townspeople he held in high regard. His refusal to arrest accused witches lead to himself being accused of witchcraft, and on May 10 of the same year a warrant for Willard's arrest was ratified. Willard fled to Nashaway, where he was discovered following the issue of a second warrant for his arrest. Once returned to Danvers, Mercy Lewis, at this time the lover of Henry Wilkins, one of Bray's sons, accused Willard of being responsible for the death of her newborn son Daniel. Willard was put on trial on May 18, during which Bray Wilkins testified that he had been inflicted with a very painful condition after Willard had given him a stare, recounting, \"[Willard] lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any.\" Indeed, a kidney stone had begun to afflict Bray after he had encountered Willard in the middle of a meal some days before. Two of Bray's daughters and several others gave second-hand testimony that John Willard had beaten his wife Margaret and then exhibited odd behavior which frightened her into running to a relative's house for safety. During his examination, he denied these allegations with the rest, and desired that his wife would be called to testify on his behalf, but this does not appear to have been done. Indeed, no such frenzy is known to have occurred at any point, Margaret and John shared three children and lived a modest life. Regardless, the testimony of the Wilkins family was damning, and Willard was found guilty and hanged for witchcraft that August.\n\nBray Wilkins died in January 1702. His burial place is not known, though legend places in on the original foundations of Danvers/Middleton that he and Gengell built, today known as \"Will's Hill\", also where he passed away.\n\nThe identity of Bray Wilkins' wife isn't known, but there are two candidates: Hannah Way and Hannah Gengell. Hannah Gengell is proposed to have been the sister of Bray's lifelong partner John Gengell. Neither candidate has more evidence favoring their identification over the other, however it is more likely Bray married Hannah Way as opposed to Hannah Gengell. Any mention of Bray's wife simply refers to her as \"Hannah\" and no mention of her maiden name is ever recorded in the sparse times she is ever mentioned. No record of her death is known to exist. \n\nTwo persons who had access to much early documentary material about the Wilkins family, now lost, Martha J. Averill and Emily Ann Milliken née Wilkins, maintained that Bray's wife was Hannah Gengell, and furthermore the Wilkins are described with familial kindness in John Gengell’s will dated 10 April 1685. However, a 1984 article from The American Genealogist written by David L. Greene disputes the identification of Bray's wife as a Gengell by claiming the main piece of support, John Gengell's will, makes the conclusion impossible, as Gengell called himself 70 in that document, and thus about 21 when Bray married Hannah (though \"why\" this fact makes it impossible for the wife of Bray Wilkins to be Hannah Gengell is suspiciously unexplained). Though Greene acknowledges that it is difficult to escape the inference that Bray and John Gengell were in some way related, he advances the following arguments: Henry Way arrived at Nantasket in 1630 (meaning he was in New England when Bray was) with his wife Elizabeth and children Samuel, Richard, Henry, and Susanna, suggesting the seemingly missing entry for his son Aaron Way may indicate that other children may very well have gone undocumented. Additionally, Bray purportedly sold land to what he called his \"trusty kinsman\" in May 1675, one of whom was clarified as Aaron Way. Furthermore, during his testimony against Willard in 1692, Bray called Richard Way, his theoretical brother-in-law, his 'brother'. Greene also mentions one of Bray’s sons was named ‘Henry’, which he postulates was intended as the namesake of Hannah Way’s father. However, there is no reason to think that other relationships couldn’t explain the language. After all, members of a common social group might call themselves \"brothers\" or \"cousins\" without any actual blood or marital relationship. Still, it doesn’t help the case of the Gengell identification that Hannah Way is attested to while Hannah Gengell isn’t. John Gengell himself is only sparsely attested to, let alone a hypothetical sister of his, and even then, none of the surviving pieces that attest to his existence give an idea of his personal life. On the other hand, the Way family is very well documented; manuscript summaries of the parish registers for Bridport and Allington, Dorset, in the collection of the Rev. Richard Grosvenor Bartelot, show that Henry Way married Elizabeth Batchelar on 22 Jan. 1615, (apparently as his second wife) and that they had a daughter \"Hanah\" who was baptized there on 3 March 1616. Additionally, while it is true and evident in John Gengell’s will that he regarded the Wilkins very highly, he very explicitly avoids calling them relatives. Coincidentally, Aaron Way is also mentioned alongside a “Mary Way” as a witness in the will.\n\nBray was only married once, the wedding probably taking place between 1632 and 1636. Bray Wilkins had eight children:\n\n\n"}

He spent most of his scientific career rising through the ranks of this famous federal scientific agency.\n\nHis early work regarding fluid and plasma instabilities led to the discovery of the magnetorotational instability in 1959 and the electrothermal instability in 1962.\n\nIn 1964, he defended his thesis before receiving his Doctor of Science degree in physics and mathematics.\n\nIn 1968, he obtained the rank of Professor of atomic physics, plasma physics and microelectronics at the Physics Department of Moscow State University. In 1973, he became the head of the Department until 1988. \nIn 1971, he became a member of the Communist Party.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1978, he was the director of the Magnetic Laboratory (later known as the TRINITY State Scientific Center), a branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1956, and subdivision of Kurchatov Institute since 1961, at Troitsk, Moscow Oblast. \n\nIn 1972, he founded an energy and space plasma research department at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT, more known as \"Phystech\"), with a base in this branch of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy (KIAE).\n\nIn 1975, he established another new department at Phystech in order to study the problems of physics and energy, for which he received the honor of chair of plasma energy. The next year, he was appointed as the first dean of the \"Faculty of Physics For Energy\" (FPFE), a R&D department of fusion energy specialized in plasma and high pressure physics, quantum optics, laser and space technologies. Ten years later, in 1986, he was promoted as the scientific director of FPFE.\n\nIn 1988, he was named director of Kurchatov Institute and chairman of the international programme (Russia, USA, European Union and Japan) for the creation of the thermonuclear experimental tokamak ITER, and has been its president from 1992 until the present. In 2009 he was elected Chair of the ITER Council, the governing body of ITER.\n\nHe is also president of the joint stock company Rosshelf (Russian offshore development company to develop seafloor-based oil and gas production complex), Gazprom's subsidiary; and co-chairman of Relcom board of directors.\n\nEvgeny Velikhov currently resides in Moscow.\n\nEvgeny Velikhov is well known in the world scientific and engineering community for his diverse activities, for which he has received several honors and awards, among which:\n\n"}

Smith\n\nHomer William Smith (January 2, 1895 – March 25, 1962), best known as Homer W. Smith was an American physiologist and science writer.\n\nSmith was born in Denver, Colorado. He received his D.Sc in 1921 from Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health. From 1928 until his retirement in 1961 he was the Professor of Physiology and Director of the Physiological Laboratories at New York University School of Medicine. Smith was a leader in the field of renal physiology. His elegant experiments on the kidney in the 1930s proved beyond any doubt that it operated according to physical principles, both as a filter and a secretory organ, eliminating the last vestige of vitalism in physiology. He used inulin (at the same time as A.N. Richards), to measure how much kidney filtrate is formed. His book \"The Kidney: Structure and Function in Health and Disease\", was an authoritative summary of what was known at that time..\n\nHe also wrote brilliantly for general readers. \"From Fish to Philosopher\" explains how evolutionary history accounts for the seemingly bewildering mammalian kidney, in which water, salts, and small molecules are filtered from the blood into kidney tubules and then much of the water and salt and many of the small molecules are pumped back into the blood stream. Vertebrates originated in fresh water, where water was drawn into their bodies by the osmotic pressure of their body fluids. Their kidneys excreted the extra water while also retrieving their supply of small solutes. He concludes with an admiring discussion of another of his interests: how rapidly the piano can be played by an educated nervous system sustained by the kidneys. \"Komongo or, the Lungfish and the Padre\" takes place in the Suez Canal where a scientist returning to the United States with a cargo of lungfish for kidney experiments delivers a monologue to an Anglican Minister on how evolution shapes organisms. \"Man and His Gods\" \"considered man's ideas about the supernatural in the perspective of the evolution of western theology and philosophy from the ancient Egyptians to the nineteenth century\".\n\nHe also served on the board of trustees of Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 1952-1955.\n\nAs a memorial to Smith in 1963 the New York Heart Association created the Homer W. Smith Award in Renal Physiology.\n\nHomer Smith was married to Margaret Wilson, who was the daughter of Lily and James Robert Wilson from Spring City, Tennessee. His son was Homer Wilson Smith.\n\nSmith attacked superstition and was critical of religious ideas. He identified as an agnostic but has also been described as an atheist and humanist.\n\nSmith was an advocate of the Christ myth theory.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1719188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1719188", "title": "Indonesian names", "text": "Indonesian names\n\nIndonesian names and naming customs reflect the multicultural and polyglot nature of the over 17,000 islands in the Indonesian archipelago. The world's fourth most populous nation, Indonesia is home to approximately 365 tribal-ethnic groups, each with their own culture, customs, and language. The state officially recognises more than 300 of these ethnic groups. The Javanese are the largest single group, comprising around 40 percent of Indonesia's population.\n\nIn Indonesia, ranks and professional titles are used. It is also customary to use \"Pak\", \"Bapak\" or \"Saudara\" to address men and \"Bu\", \"Saudari\" or \"Ibu\" to address women. \"Pak\" and \"Bapak\" are literally translated as \"father\". \"Bapak\" is more formal and is used much like the English word, \"sir\". \"Saudara\" (for men) or \"Saudari\" (for women) is another term of greater respect and formality. It translates to \"kinsman\", \"lady\" or \"gentleman\". \"Ibu\" is literally translated as \"mother\". It is used as \"ma'am\" or \"lady\" would be in English. If addressing a man whose name is unknown, one uses \"Bapak\" and if addressing a woman whose name is unknown, one uses \"Ibu\".\n\nAn informal way to address a significantly older person is to use \"Om\", \"Paman\", \"Bibi\" or \"Tante\", which mean \"uncle\" and \"aunt\". The terms are Dutch-influenced and quite commonly used in the big cities.\n\nLocal honorifics continue to be employed throughout Indonesia. In a casual situation, \"Kakak\" is used to address a person as an older sister or brother. In Javanese \"Mbak\" is used for \"older sister\" and \"Mas\" is used for \"older brother\". \"Mbak\" and \"Mas\" are used for example to address junior staff in cafes and restaurants in Jakarta.\n\nIn Sumatran Malay or Minangkabau cultural spheres, an older brother is addressed as \"Abang\". However, it is also common to address a becak driver, angkot driver, vegetable vendor, fishmonger or hawker with \"Abang\".\n\n\"Gus\" (from \"bagus\") is used exclusively to address an honorable Eastern Javanese person with a strong traditional and religious identity. For example, the Indonesian former president, Abdurrahman Wahid is often addressed as \"Gus Dur\".\n\nIndonesians do not generally use a given or first name and a family, last or surname name. The majority of Indonesians do not have family names. Rather, their given names are geographically and culturally specific. Names beginning with \"Su\" in Indonesian spelling (\"Soe\" in Dutch orthography), or ending with an \"o\" are usually Javanese people. For example, people called \"Suprapto\" or \"Soeprapto, Joko\" are likely to be of Javanese descent. Suharto is another example.\n\nBalinese names are quite distinct, as they have a naming system which denotes birth order. \"Wayan\" means first born. \"Made\" means second born. A Balinese name may also indicate caste. For instance, a Kshatriya person may be named \"I Gusti\".\n\n\"Sitompul\" and \"Rajagukguk\" are clan names usually found in people with Batak or North Sumatran heritage.\n\nIn general, Indonesian names fall into one of the following categories:\n\n\nUntil recently, most Indonesians did not have family names. Both men and women usually have a given name and then take the name of their father as a last name. Some, but not all, married Indonesian women take the last name of their husband. This name is usually added after their own \"last\" name. Therefore, it is not rare for married couples to have different last or family names.\n\nNaming also differs regionally. Some Javanese, especially those of the old generation have only one name. Bataks have clan names which are used as their surnames. Some Chinese Indonesians have Chinese-style names. In Indonesian telephone directories, names are listed under the first or given name and not under the last or family name.\n\nExample:\n\nOn the birth certificate, the child's name would be written as \"Hasan child of Suparman and Wulandari\". The birth certificate of an extramarital child would bear only the mother's name. On a school diploma, the child's name would be written as \"Hasan, child of Suparman\". On all other official documents (ID card, driver's license, and passport), only the child's name would appear, \"Hasan\".\n\nExample:\n\nOn the birth certificate, the child's name would be written as \"Hasan Prasetyo child of Suparman Prakoso and Wulandari Hartono\". On all other official documents, the child's name would be written as \"Hasan Prasetyo\".\n\nIf the parents want a family name (or surname) to appear on official documents, the family name should be included on the child's birth certificate.\n\nExample:\n\nOn the birth certificate, the child's name would be written as \"Yovan Gunardio Darmawan child of Budi Darmawan and Natalena Tirrand\". On all other official documents, the child's name would be written as \"Yovan Gunardio Darmawan\".\n\nThe patronymic is usually constructed from the father's name, with the word \"putra\" (for males, \"son\" in Sanskrit) or \"putri\" (for females, \"daughter\" in Sanskrit) appended.\n\nExample:\n\nOn the birth certificate, the child's name would be written as \"Hasan Suparmanputra child of Suparman and Wulandari\". On all other official documents, the child's name would be written as \"Hasan Suparmanputra\". This would be somewhat analogous to the practice in Iceland, where patronymics are used.\n\nOccasionally, the father's name will be used as the surname, without appending \"putra\" or \"putri\" (in this example it would be Hasan Suparman). This might be done unofficially, that is, not matching the birth certificate. Nevertheless, this format sometimes appears on government documents.\n\nOther nations may modify an official Indonesian name to conform to local standards. This is most apparent in nations where individuals normally have a family or last name.\n\nIn the Netherlands, for example, a person without an official family name would be given the surname \"Onbekend\" (which means \"unknown\"). Individuals with multiple-word names will often be given this surname, particularly if the last name on the birth certificate differs from the father's family name. Individuals with a distinct family name may also be given this surname if it is recorded differently on the birth certificate.\n\nReferring to the examples above, a Netherlands identification card would record the individual's name as:\n\nIn Germany, the one-word name is used as both given name and surname. This is often displayed on official documents as \"Hasan Hasan\" or \"H. Hasan\".\n\nIn the U.S., there are three ways to record people with a single-word name. One way is to use the existing single word name as the surname. Then, an official body will add \"Fnu\" (family name unknown) as the first or given name. This can lead to a false belief that \"Fnu\" is a common Indonesian first name.\n\nConversely, the existing single word name can be used as the given or first name and then \"Lnu\" (last name unknown) may be added as the family, surname or last name. This can lead to the misconception that \"Lnu\" is a common Indonesian surname. In some cases \"Fnu\" will be used as the surname or last name.\n\nLastly, the existing single word name may be duplicated to give a first name and surname such as \"Hasan Hasan\".\n\nThere are some Indonesian ethnic groups or tribes whose people do maintain a family, last or surname. These include the:\n\nIndonesians regardless of personal religion, particularly the Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese may have names strongly derived from Sanskrit. This is because of the Indian cultural influence which came to the archipelago since thousands of years ago during the Indianization of South East Asian kingdoms, and ever since, it is seen as part of the Indonesian culture, especially Javanese, Balinese, and some part of Sumatran culture. Thus, related Hindu or Indian culture in Indonesia is present not only as part of religion, but also culture. As a result, it is common to find Muslim or Christian Indonesians with Indo-Sanskritic sounding names. Unlike Sanskrit-derived names in Thai and Khmer, the pronunciation of such names in either Javanese or Indonesian is similar to the original Indian pronunciation, except that the \"v\" is changed to a \"w\".\n\nSome common names derived from Sanskrit and using the names of Indian Hindu gods or heroes include Indra, Krisna, Wisnu, Surya, Dharma, Rama, Lesmana, Sudarto (Javanese for Siddharta), Dewi, Pertiwi, Sri, Sinta, Ratna, Paramitha, and Kumala. Other Sanskrit derived names used widely in Indonesia also include such as: Wibisana or Wibisono (from the Ramayana figure Vibhisana), Arya or Aryo, Subrata, Aditya, Abimanyu, Bima, Sena, Satya, Cakra (read Chakra), Putri, Putra, Mahardhika, Gatot or Gatut (from the Mahabharata figure Ghatotkacha), Perdana (from the word \"Pradhan\"), Prameswara or Prameswari, Pertiwi (from Pritvhi), Dewi (Devi), Wijaya (from Vijay), and many more. Even Indonesian government names of institutions, mottoes, and other terms also use Sanskrit, such as to address an Indonesian Navy general, the word \"Laksamana\" (from the Ramayan figure Lakshman) is used. The \"Adipura award\" (Indonesian: \"Penghargaan Adipura\") which is an award given to cities throughout Indonesia from the central government for cleanliness and urban environmental management also uses from Sanskrit language which is \"Adi\" and \"Pura\". There are also many mottoes of Indonesian institutions which use Sanskrit language, such as the motto of the Indonesian Military Academy which sounds \"Adhitakarya Mahatvavirya Nagarabhakti\".\n\nFor example, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, former Indonesian president, has a Sanskrit-derived name. \"Susilo\" comes from \"sushila\" meaning \"good character\" and \"Yudhoyono\" comes form \"yudha\" meaning \"war\" or \"battle\" and \"yana\" meaning \"an epic story\". Sukarno is derived from the Sanskrit \"su\" (good) and \"karno\" or \"Karna\" (a warrior) in Mahabharata.\n\nSome of these Sanskrit-derived names might be used by \"ningrat\" or \"menak\" (noble) families, especially among Javanese and Sundanese, in much the same way as some family names in western culture indicate lineage and nobility. Some such names are Adiningrat, Notonegoro, Suryasumantri, Dharmokusumo, Wongsoatmodjo, Natalegawa, Kusumaatmadja, Kartadibrata, Kartapranata and Kartasasmita.\n\nIn the case of the Indonesian foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, \"Marty\" is his first name, indicating his birth in March. \"Natalegawa\" is his family name, which indicates that he is from a Sundanese noble family.\n\nMany Indonesians use Sanskrit-derived names to indicate their position among siblings (birth order). The first-born child might bear the name \"Eka\" or \"Eko\" (mostly Javanese), the second-born child might be named \"Dwi\", the third-born \"Tri\", the fourth-born \"Catur\", and the fifth-born \"Panca\" or \"Ponco\" (usually Javanese). Some examples are Eko Yuli Irawan, Rizky Dwi Ramadhana, Triyaningsih, and Catur Pamungkas.\n\nUnder President Suharto, Indonesia attempted to deconstruct organisations and groups that might represent an internal security threat. As a part of the policy to limit the influence of the Chinese Communists and to encourage the ethnic Chinese to assimilate, the state required Chinese Indonesian individuals to change their names. This was a difficult balance because while the names were changed, laws continued to identify them as 'different' from indigenous Indonesian groups. Indonesian businessman, Liem Sioe Liong, for example, had his name changed to Sudono Salim. With Suharto's downfall came new laws, one of which allowed the Chinese to revert to Chinese family names.\n\nMany of the later generations have kept the Indonesian form of the name. Other Chinese Indonesians, however, maintain their Chinese name as well as their family names. As is customary with Chinese names, the family name (or surname) is traditionally written in front of the given (or first) name.\n\nAs Islam is the largest religion in Indonesia, it is quite common to find Arabic first names or words. Popular Arabic names include Muhammad or Mohammad, Abdul, Ali, Amir, Annisa, Aisyah, Aziz, Ahmad, Hassan, Habibie, Hidayat, Ibrahim, Nur, Nurul, Rahman, Taufik and Umar. Such names are used by Indonesians not of Arab descent, both as first names and as surnames.\n\nEthnic groups with strong Islamic influence, such as the Acehnese, Malay, Minangkabau, Betawi and Bugis, tend to use Arabic names. For example, Indonesian politicians Teuku Muhammad Hasan (from Aceh) and Mohammad Hatta (from Minangkabau) have Arabic names. However, some of these ethnic groups with strong Islamic influences, such as the Betawi people, have Arabic names which have been suitable with the local pronunciation, such as Rojak (Razak), Leman (Sulaiman), etc.\n\nArabs settled in Indonesia many generations ago, and their descendants still use their family names, for example, Assegaf, Alhabsyi, or Shihab.\n\nThe name \"Maysaroh\" is a common female name amongst the Betawi people. However, this name is actually a male name in Arab countries. It is probably mistaken with the name Saroh, which is in turn derived from Sarah.\n\nWestern names were brought to Indonesia by the Portuguese and later the Dutch. Names with a Dutch origin include Henry, Agus, Johan, Andri, Anto (Antonius), Siska, Roni, Jono, Riska, Suzanna, Rian, and Markus. These names are found in Muslim and Christian people of Java.\n\nCatholic Indonesians may use Latin first or Christian names such as Antonius, Ignatius, Johannes, Markus, Paulus, Anastasia, Fransiska, Maria, Georgius, and Theresia. Protestant Indonesians may use Anglicised names such as Anthony, Martin, George, James, John, Paul, Caroline, Eva, Stephanie, Mary, or Melinda.\n\nThere are some similarities between the Indonesian Catholic and Muslim names such as Fatima, Omar, and Soraya.\n\nDue to globalisation non-Christian Indonesians may use shortened Western names such as Courtney, Tony or Julie.\n\nCombinations such as \"Ricky Hidayat\" (Western-Arabic) or \"Lucy Wiryono\" (Western-Javanese) are to be found as well.\n\nWestern-derived names may indicate the month of birth. For example,\n\nThe Indonesian patronymic family name is usually constructed of the father's name, with the word \"putra\" (for male) or \"putri\" (for female) appended. One example is former Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of former President Sukarno. However, it is also common for the father's name alone to form the child's surname (for instance, 'Ali Ahmad' from the father 'Ahmad Sudharma').\n\nLocated in Western Sumatra, the Minangkabau are the largest matrilineal culture in the world and the fourth largest ethnic group in Indonesia. Tribe, clan (or \"suku\") titles, properties and names are all handed down through the female line.\n\nIt is uncommon, and considered rude, to refer to an Indonesian person by their full first name, unless that name has only one or two syllables. Former Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid, for example, had \"Abdurrahman\" shortened to \"Dur\". Many Indonesians use a different name altogether; a woman born as \"Khadijah\" may be known as \"Ida\" or \"Ijah\" to all her friends and family.\n\nIn Sundanese culture it is common for the nickname to become integrated as the first name. For example, someone with the name \"Komariah\", \"Gunawan\" or \"Suryana\" written in their birth certificate may become known as \"Kokom\" for Komariah, \"Gugun\" or \"Wawan\" for Gunawan, and \"Yaya\" or \"Nana\" for Suryana. The result is rhyming names such as \"Kokom Komariah\", \"Wawan Gunawan\", and \"Nana Suryana\". Notable people having such names include politician Agum Gumelar, comedian Entis Sutisna (with stage name Sule'), and sportsman Ajat Sudrajat.\n\nIndonesian people might also take a Western style nickname such as Kevin, Kenny, Tommy (Tomi), Jimmy, Ricky, Dicky, Bob, Nicky, Nico, Susy, Taty, Lucy (Lusi), Nancy, Marry (Maria) and so on. It does not necessarily mean their names are Thomas (for Tommy) or James (for Jimmy). For instance, Suharto's son, Hutomo Mandalaputra is popularly known as \"Tommy Suharto\". The \"Tommy\" here was not derived from \"Thomas\", but from the Javanese name, \"Hutomo\".\n\nIn some ethnic groups it is common to include a nobility title into the formal personal name. Due to the various traditions of nobility in each ethnic group, it may be difficult for people from outside a particular ethnic group to discern the nobility title from the personal name.\n\nAcehnese have titles such as \"Teuku\" (male) and \"Cut\" (female). Celebrities with such titles include, for example, Teuku Ryan, Teuku Wisnu, and Cut Tari.\n\nBantenese have titles such as \"Tubagus\" (male) and \"Ratu\" (female). People with such titles include, for example, Tubagus Ismail, and Ratu Atut Chosiyah.\n\nThe Bugis and Makassar people have titles such as \"Daeng\" and \"Andi\" and the Buton people have titles such as \"La\" (male) and \"Wa\" (female), for example, La Nyalla Mattalitti or Wa Ode Nurhayati.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Manual of Style, Indonesian names are indexed differently according to the individual practices and customs.

Flossenbürg, 3 December 1941) was a Czech astrologer, hermeticist and publicist in the age between the two World Wars. He was the chairman of Universalia, a society of Czech hermeticists.\n\nKefer's father was from Bavaria. He was born blind due to a congenital defect of his eyes, but this cleared up when he was three years old. In Prague he studied at the Archbishop Gymnasium in the classroom of famous mystic Jaroslav Ovečka. He became a novice at Strahov Monastery, but later left the order. He graduated from Charles University in Prague with a degree in arts.\n\nKefer practised astrology, kabbalah, magick, alchemy and theurgy. He wrote many works about astrology and hermetism, and regularly discoursed on these themes in the Universalia Society. He also translated many meaningful books into Czech language, including Bardo Thödol or the books of Eliphas Lévi.\n\nKefer worked as a librarian of the National Museum in Prague and later as a librarian of Strahov Monastery and in the library of the Vatican. He was longtime secretary and later president of the society of Czechoslovakian hermeticists, Universalia, and editor of \"Logos\" journal.\n\nPerhaps Kefer's most famous act was performing three magick rituals against Adolf Hitler, with the aim of killing him. He was arrested on 18 June 1941 by the Gestapo, who offered him a place as Hitler's personal astrologist or participation in his astrological team, but he refused. Jan Kefer died in Flossenbürg concentration camp on 3 December 1941.\n\n"}

He was educated at Prior Park Preparatory School in Cricklade, a co-educational Catholic independent school until year six where he moved to Downside School, a co-educational independent school in Stratton-on-the-Fosse in Somerset, followed by the University of Exeter, where he studied Politics and Economics. He once elicited a donation of £1,000,000 when working in the university's fundraising department. He is the son of a farmer and a nurse and is also a professional tennis coach. It was announced in week two that Mr Addington had decided to leave the show after having been told his older soldier brother was badly injured by a bomb in Afghanistan.\nRaleigh is currently a director at Tickets for Troops, an organisation helping the armed forces.\nRaleigh has recently set up the company Military Speakers.\n\nStuart Baggs was a telecoms entrepreneur from the Isle of Man and was 21 when he appeared on the programme. He was educated at Ramsey Grammar School, and had a fear of \"The Muppets\" character Sam Eagle. His first business venture was when he sold yo-yos on the school playground. At thirteen he launched his own telecommunications company, Bluewave Communications, which became a limited company on his eighteenth birthday and which he continued to run. He styled himself as \"Stuart Baggs—the brand\" and nicknamed himself \"Herr Baggs\" in the crisp-selling task.\n\nBaggs produced some memorable quotes throughout the series, including: \"Everything I touch turns to sold\", \"Excuse me, sir, you look like a sausage connoisseur\" (quoted to Lord Sugar), \"I'm not a one-trick pony, I'm not a ten-trick pony, I have a whole field of ponies—and they're literally all running towards this job\", and the infamous \"I have to rein in my own extreme masculinity in this task.\" Baggs was eliminated in week 11. WalesOnline perceived him as \"one of the truly great Apprentice villains.\" \n\nBefore firing him, Lord Sugar told Baggs that he was \"full of shit\" and guilty of dressing up his credentials for his own gain, with particular reference to a telecommunications licence issued in 2006. Sugar added that Baggs' claims had left him annoyed at himself, as he had fired Liz Locke in the previous week before he was aware of the lie. Baggs denied that he had lied on his CV about the company. Baggs was not invited back to participate in the final.\n\nBaggs appeared as a contestant on Channel 4's \"Celebrity Five Go To\" in May 2011. He also appeared on \"Pointless Celebrities\" with fellow ex-Apprentice contestant Joanna Riley in July 2011. Whilst on the show, he claimed to have tried a food called Panayiotou, when in actuality, it was George Michael's surname. He was a regular panelist/reporter for \"Big Brother's Bit On The Side\" from August 2011. In February 2013, he appeared on \"The Sarah Millican Television Programme\" and said that \"The Apprentice\" had \"made him the most unemployable person in the country\". In November 2014, he appeared as a contestant on \"Come Dine With Me\" in his home country, which he called \"great fun\" while admitting that he was \"a terrible cook\".\n\nBaggs was found dead on 30 July 2015, aged 27, as a result of an asthma attack.\n\nChris Bates is a 24-year-old from Surrey. He was educated at Wallington County Grammar School for Boys, a state school in Wallington in the London Borough of Sutton, followed by the University of Nottingham, from which he graduated with 1st Class Honours. After leaving university, he worked for nine months for JP Morgan, a commercial and investment banking institution in London, and left it to appear on the programme. His past jobs have included working in an off-licence and a pub. He was fired in The Apprentice Final 2010, being beaten by Stella English. Lord Sugar said that he was not worried about Chris's future, and said that his doors will always be open for him. Bates was the first male Runner Up of the apprentice UK.\n\nHe started working as an Investment Analyst for former Dragon's Den panelist James Caan's private equity company Hamilton Bradshaw. After around one year, he joined PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)'s Transaction Advisory Services, and studied the ACA qualification from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). After qualifying as a Chartered Accountant, he now works at Catalyst Corporate Finance, London as a Principal.\n\nMelissa Cohen is a 27-year-old food business manager from London. She was educated at Jewish Free School, a voluntary aided comprehensive school in Kenton in north London. Formerly a hairdresser before venturing into food business management, where she single-handedly increased the share of the Kosher food market for a major retail chain. She also co-wrote a jingle for a successful supermarket advertising campaign for the same chain.\n\nShe was fired in the fourth week after taking much of the limelight for her confrontations with other contestants without achieving much in the way of success. She returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by Stella English to be in her team.\n\nStella English left school with no qualifications, but at the time of entering had become Head of Business Management on the trading floor of a Japanese investment bank. She was the series winner, beating Chris Bates in the final mainly because of her experience in business. She was born and grew up in Thamesmead, London. She lives in London with her partner Ray, and she was to be married in the Summer of 2011. \nEnglish proved to be a very successful candidate throughout the series, holding the best record against all other competitors. She showed terrific leadership abilities in the second task, where she was dispatched to the boys' team and led them to victory by stopping their arguing and managing them well. She continued to win most of the tasks throughout the series, but in the run up to the final in tasks 9 and 10 she was accused by her fellow candidates of being \"wooden\" and \" vanilla corporate\", but Lord Sugar claimed this was because of her working in a Japanese Bank. Due to her consistent performance throughout the series and her serious, some would say ruthless, determination, Lord Sugar made her a finalist. She showed excellent leadership and organizational skills in the last task, and in the boardroom Lord Sugar made the decision to hire English. She commented she was looking forward to the future and she was extremely happy. After winning, English worked at Sugar's company Viglen. She quit the job in May 2011, saying that she was just a \"glorified PA\", going to work for YouView, of which Sugar is the chairman. In October 2011, she resigned from YouView claiming she had had almost no contact with Sugar in her role.\n\nIn June 2013 Lord Sugar sued English for £35,000 over her failed constructive dismissal case against him. A spokesman for Lord Sugar said: \"An application has been made to the tribunal to recover our costs.\". English said \"I thought it was over. I am devastated I can’t just move on with my life.\" At the court case, English divulged that her attempted business ventures — including a fashion label and events company — had fallen flat, meaning that she was now claiming jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, and was facing a repossession order on her house. Sugar did not win the case, and English said that she was keen to put the saga behind her. In February 2014 it was announced that two contractors who worked for English's failed events company were suing her for unpaid fees. In February 2015 English was convicted of failing to reveal the identity of the driver of her car when it was caught speeding. English ignored five letters from the police requesting the information. English was fined £900, ordered to pay £900 court costs and a £90 victim surcharge, and had six points put on her driving licence.\n\nAlex Epstein is 26 years old and unemployed from Manchester. Previously the Head of Communications at Masternaut Three X in Leeds. He was educated at The King David High School, a voluntary aided Jewish Orthodox comprehensive school in Crumpsall in Manchester. He was awarded 10 A*s at GCSE, but was sacked from his first job making ice-cream at Häagen-Dazs. He later ventured into corporate communications before losing his job, allegedly because of the recession.\n\nIn week 1, Alex found himself in the boardroom, selected by project manager Dan for his poor working habits. Alex improved in the second and third weeks – the latter especially, where he secured several clients for the bread-making task. Ultimately, his bad habits resurfaced in week 5, where he guided his, and project manager Paloma's team into multiple retail-related errors. His sales ability was also heavily criticised. In week 6, a mixed performance thus far, Alex found himself as project manager for a marketing campaign for cleaning products. Despite his background in communications, Alex broke fundamental advertising rules, and combined with his Machievellian selection of Sandeesh for firing, despite her competent performance, was enough to see him fired by Lord Sugar. Lord Sugar implied that Laura Moore might have been fired instead of Alex, had Alex selected her to return to the boardroom. He returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by Chris Bates to be in his team.\n\nChristopher Farrell was a 28-year-old mortgage broker from Cheshire. He was educated at Overchurch Junior School, a state primary school and Woodchurch High School, a state comprehensive school in the Woodchurch area of the Wirral Peninsula in North West England. He was a Royal Marine Commando for 10 years, serving in Iraq, Northern Ireland, Kosovo and Afghanistan before becoming a mortgage broker.\n\nFarrell was fired in week 8 – his first time in the boardroom. Lord Sugar stated that he felt Christopher was a hard worker and excellent logistically, but lacking in the special talent that is necessary in 'The Apprentice'. He returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by Stella English to be in her winning team.\n\nFarrell has since left the public eye after selling his Financial Services company for an undisclosed fee. However, he was reported to be in the millions. He is now investing in property and is reported to have a portfolio of up to 30 buildings.\n\nDan Harris is a 34-year-old father-of-two and a sales director from Oxfordshire. He is a former GB triathlete, who has completed three ultramarathons as well as climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. He once jointly held the world record for the fastest ascent and descent of Mount Kenya. Whilst studying at Southampton Solent University, he launched three businesses including a nightclub promotions company and an embroidery business that reputedly supplied 30% of the branded garments to Southampton University.\n\nAfter graduation he worked briefly for a head hunting firm in Fareham, before leaving to join a weapons logistics company in Pittsburgh. After being made redundant he returned to the UK to pursue an IT career. Unable to find a role, he worked as a dustman before founding his own company. He successfully ran an IT Security firm for 8 years before selling the company and establishing a Recruitment company. He sold this company two years later but rejoined it as non-executive director.\n\nThe News of the World reported that he had made a personal fortune of £2.5M but had lost the majority of that in the recession when his company hit difficulties.\nDan was the first to be fired in the sixth series, despite leading the team to profit and losing by just £15, the show's fourth lowest-ever losing margin. His aggressive style on the task and relaxed attitude in the boardroom were cited as reasons for his firing.\n\nJamie Lester is a 28-year-old overseas property developer from London. He is the son of a cab driver, and was educated at Ilford Jewish Primary School in Ilford in Essex A former estate agent, he owned two properties by the age of 23 and started his own company at 24, turning over £1,000,000 in two-and-a-half years. He could have been fired in week seven had Sandeesh brought him in the boardroom.\nJamie was fired in week 11. He returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by Chris Bates to be in his team. Jamie set up his South-West London estate agency Haus Properties in 2011.\n\nElizabeth \"Liz\" Locke is a 24-year-old investment banker from Birmingham. She was educated at King Edward VI Handsworth School, a state grammar school for girls in Handsworth in Birmingham, from 1996–2003. After experience in investment banking, she has recently ventured into property development and project management. Locke graduated from Birmingham Business School, part of the University of Birmingham, in 2007 with a first-class honours degree in accounting and finance.\n\nShe was controversially fired in Week 10 for not having a special 'spark' despite being a record-breaking candidate. In episode 11, Alan Sugar told Stuart Baggs that he was annoyed with himself for firing Liz after being swayed by Baggs' lies in the boardroom. This makes Liz the second person (the first being Miriam Staley) that Sugar has publicly regretted firing after the event. Liz returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by Chris Bates to be in his team.\n\nLaura Moore is a 22-year-old business development manager from Warwickshire, now living in London. She is a trained violinist, and single-handedly brought in over £500,000 of sales in her first year as a management consultant. As project manager in week two, Laura had a hard time controlling her all-girl team, with Karren Brady giving the girls a dressing-down in the boardroom. She appeared in her team's fashion advert in week five and was only brought into the boardroom twice throughout the series. She was fired in week nine, with friend Liz Locke saying that she would be missed.\n\nBefore appearing on The Apprentice, Laura had been involved in four start-up businesses, and has since been involved in projects to encourage young entrepreneurs.\n\nLaura is still involved with various start-ups, whilst also working in fashion, representing The Prince's Trust as an ambassador, and doing motivational and corporate speaking engagements. She has recently joined the committee of Businesswoman of the Year.\n\nJoanna Riley is a 25-year-old cleaning company owner from Leicester. She set up her Midlands-based cleaning company at the age of 22. Her first job was as a hotel waitress, later moving into telecommunications at a call centre before becoming her own boss. Before the series aired, it was reported that Riley had been convicted for racially abusing three taxi drivers in October 2005.\nJoanna was fired in week eleven, finishing fourth. She returned in episode 12 to help the finalist with their task, and was selected by \nStella English to be in her team.\n\nBefore firing her, Lord Sugar told her that he wanted her to be proud of what she does for a living. He fired her, but praised her hard work, telling her to be very proud of herself and she should leave with her head held up high.\n\nRiley appeared as a contestant on \"Pointless Celebrities\" with fellow ex-Apprentice contestant Stuart Baggs in July 2011.\n\nShahab \"Shibby\" Robati is a 27-year-old business owner, originally from Leeds now living in London. Robati was educated at The Royal Grammar School, a boys' independent school in Guildford in Surrey. His first job was as a paper boy at the age of 17. He since turned his hand to business development. A voice impersonator and self-confessed comedian, Shibby claims to have made £150,000 turnover and over £90,000 profit in the first year of setting up two businesses. However, during the series whilst pleading about his inexperience he claimed that he had never been involved in either sales or negotiations. He was fired in week three after leading his team to failure in the breadmaking task. He returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by \nChris Bates to be in his team.\n\nSandeesh Samra is a 26-year-old recruitment consultant from Nottingham. She started her working life as a sales assistant for Toys R Us. As a recruitment consultant, she managed to break a company revenue record.\n\nSandeesh performed reasonably well in the opening weeks, notably advocating an exclusivity deal that could have seen her team take victory in the second task. However, this was followed by a string of poor showings – her disruptive attitude towards her Project Manager saw her taken into the boardroom in Week three, where she was accused of hiding behind production. She was accused of not contributing again in weeks five and six, although this claim was disputed in week six, where she somewhat redeemed herself by delivering a good pitch. In the seventh week, despite putting in her best performance as a Project Manager, Sandeesh was fired for bringing the wrong candidates into the boardroom; Lord Sugar could not justify keeping her over Liz Locke and Chris Bates.\n\nJoy Stefanicki is a 31-year-old Marketing Director originally from Southampton, and now living in Birmingham. She started her working life cleaning dishes in her parents' pub before joining a supermarket at the age of 16. She was fired by Lord Sugar in Week 2 for having made insufficient effort in the losing team's assignment. Joy was the only candidate who fellow candidates Alex Epstein and Stuart Baggs never worked with during the series.\n\nPaloma Vivanco is a 29-year-old senior marketing manager living in London. Born in Peru, she was raised in the United States and Australia before attending university in New Zealand. She started working life frying doughnuts in Donut King before launching her first company at the age of 21 straight out of university, eventually moving into the telecommunications industry.\n\nDuring her time on The Apprentice Paloma was perceived by the Daily Mail as a villain owing to her extreme \"takes no prisoners\" attitude and often projected an egotistical image by attacking the backgrounds and abilities of other candidates including her own Project Manager Shibby Robati saying to him \"I am a businesswoman and you are a joke!\" and saying that he \"has the business skills of a schoolboy\" and despite helping Sandeesh Samra get Shibby fired she later brutally attacked her and contestant Alex Epstein for no reason prior to her firing. Vivanco also tried deliberately to set up Epstein as a scapegoat.\n\nIn week one, she demonstrated her ability to work effectively as part of a team, as a manufacturing member. Week three saw Paloma's sales abilities highlighted by Karren. Week five displayed her managerial skills when she was project manager for the task. Her ultimate flaw, which eventually led her to be fired in week five, was her tendency to have an extreme \"takes no prisoners\" attitude, where she often projected an egotistical image by attacking the backgrounds and abilities of other candidates. She returned in episode 12 to help the finalists with their task, and was selected by Stella English to be in her team.\n"}

Abene (born February 23, 1972) is an American infosec expert and entrepreneur, originally from New York City. Better known by his pseudonym Phiber Optik, he was once a member of the hacker groups Legion of Doom and Masters of Deception.\n\nPhiber Optik was a high-profile hacker in the 1980s and early 1990s, appearing in \"The New York Times\", \"Harper's\", \"Esquire\", in debates and on television. He is an important figure in the 1995 non-fiction book, \"Masters of Deception — The Gang that Ruled Cyberspace\" ().\n\nAbene's first contact with computers was at around 9 years of age at a local department store, where he would often pass the time while his parents shopped. His first computer was a TRS-80 MC-10 with 4 kilobytes of RAM, a 32-column screen, no lower case, and a cassette tape recorder to load and save programs. As was customary at the time, the computer connected to a television set for use as a monitor. \n\nAfter receiving the gifts of a RAM upgrade (to 20K) and a 300 baud modem from his parents, he used his computer to access CompuServe and shortly after discovered the world of dialup BBSes via people he met on CompuServe's \"CB simulator\", the first nationwide online chat. On some of these BBSes, Abene discovered dialups and guest accounts to DEC minicomputers running the RSTS/E and TOPS-10 operating systems as part of the BOCES educational program in Long Island, New York. Accessing those DEC minicomputers he realized there was a programming environment that was much more powerful than that of his own home computer, and so he began taking books out of the library in order to learn the programming languages that were now available to him. This and the ability to remotely save and load back programs that would still be there the next time he logged in had a profound effect on Abene, who came to view his rather simple computer as a window into a much larger world.\n\nHaving learned about programming and fundamental security concepts during those early years, Abene further honed his skill in understanding the intricacies of the nationwide telephone network. In the mid-1980s he was first introduced to members of the Legion of Doom (LOD), a loosely knit group of highly respected teenage hackers who shared Abene's uncompromising desire to understand technology. \n\nTheir main focus was to explore telecommunications systems, minicomputer and mainframe operating systems and large-scale packet data networks. The eventual decline of the LOD toward the late 1980s largely due to fragmentation and dissention within the group, coupled with the legal prosecution of a handful of its members, caused Abene to increasingly align himself with a local group of up-and-coming hackers, who came to be known as the Masters of Deception (MOD).\n\nOn January 24, 1990, Abene and other MOD members had their homes searched and property seized by the U.S. Secret Service largely based on government suspicions of having caused AT&T Corporation's network crash just over a week earlier on January 15 (Abene was personally accused by the Secret Service of having done as much, during the search and seizure). Some weeks later, AT&T themselves admitted that the crash was the result of a flawed software update to the switching systems on their long distance network, thus, human error on their part. In February 1991, Abene was arrested and charged with computer tampering and computer trespass in the first degree, New York state offenses. Laws at the time were considered a “gray area” concerning information security. Abene, who was a minor at the time, pleaded \"not guilty\" to the first two offenses and ultimately accepted a plea agreement to a lesser misdemeanor charge, and was sentenced to 35 hours of community service.\n\nAbene and four other members of the Masters of Deception were also arrested in December 1991 and indicted by a Manhattan federal grand jury on July 8, 1992, on an 11-count charge. The indictment relied heavily on evidence collected by court-approved wire tapping of telephone conversations between MOD members. According to U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier, it was the \"first investigative use of court-authorized wiretaps to obtain conversations and data transmissions of computer hackers\" in the United States.\n\nAccording to a July 9, 1992 newsletter from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the defendants faced a maximum term of 50 years in prison and fines of $2.5 million if found guilty on all counts. Despite the fact that Abene was a minor at the time the crimes were allegedly committed, was only involved in a small fraction of the sub-charges, and often in a passive way, a plea arrangement resulted in by far the harshest sentence: 12 months imprisonment, three years probation and 600 hours of community service.\n\nAfter serving the one-year sentence at the Federal Prison \"Camp\" in Schuylkill, Pennsylvania, Abene was released in November 1994. In January 1995, a huge celebration called \"Phiberphest '95\" was held in his honor at Manhattan's Irving Plaza ballroom/nightclub. In \"Time\", Joshua Quittner called him \"the first underground hero of the Information Age, the Robin Hood of cyberspace.\" Upon leaving jail, Phiber Optik made the @Cafe his hang out spot.\n\nMany people inside and outside of the hacker world felt that Abene was made an example of, and was not judged according to earlier court standards. Abene had built up a significant reputation in the hacker sub-culture, for example regularly appearing on the radio show \"Off the Hook\", hosted by Eric Corley (a.k.a. Emmanuel Goldstein), debating and defending the morals and motivations of hackers in public forums and in interviews, and lecturing on the history of telecommunications technology at the night courses of several New York City universities. At the time of the indictment he was working at MindVox, an early BBS/ISP founded by two New York LOD members, and subsequently on EchoNYC, a multi-user BBS and early ISP.\n\nECHO users, ECHO management themselves and hackers around the nation expected Abene to get off with probation or at most a few months of jail time. Co-defendants and previous offenders charged with \"hacking\" offenses had received rather lenient punishments, and given his new-found enthusiasm for using his knowledge to constructive ends, the general feeling was optimistic prior to sentencing.\n\nA statement made by U.S. Attorney Otto Obermeier in conjunction with the indication, \"The message that ought to be delivered with this indictment is that such conduct will not be tolerated, irrespective of the age of the particular accused or their ostensible purpose,\" was interpreted by Abene's supporters to mean that MOD was made an example of, to show that the authorities could handle the perceived \"hacker threat\". During sentencing, Judge Stanton said that \"the defendant stands as a symbol here today,\" and that \"hacking crimes constitute a real threat to the expanding information highway\", reinforcing the view that a relatively harmless \"teacher\" was judged as a symbol for all hackers.\nAbene has spoken on the subject of security in many publications such as \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"Time\". He has appeared as a speaker at both hacker and security industry conferences worldwide and frequently visits universities to speak to students about information security.\n\nAfter some years as a security consultant, he joined forces with former Legion of Doom member Dave Buchwald and a third colleague, Andrew Brown, to create the security consulting firm Crossbar Security. Crossbar provided consulting services for third party companies, during which the principals conducted business in the U.S., Japan, Brazil, and Sweden. As a result of the \"dot com\" bust Crossbar ultimately went defunct in 2001, largely due to cuts in corporate security spending.\n\nAbene made his acting début as \"The Inside Man\" in the fiction film \"Urchin\", completed in 2006 and released in the US in February 2007, in which other hacker notables such as Dave Buchwald and Emmanuel Goldstein can also be seen. In 2009, he founded TraceVector, an intrusion detection firm that makes use of supercomputing and data analytics. He currently resides in Silicon Valley.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1572077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1572077", "title": "Matthias Rath", "text": "Matthias Rath\n\nMatthias Rath (born 1955 in Stuttgart, Germany) is a controversial doctor, businessman, and vitamin salesman. He earned his medical degree in Germany. Rath claims that a program of nutritional supplements (which he calls \"cellular medicine\"), including formulations that he sells, can treat or cure diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. These claims are not supported by any reliable medical research. Rath runs the Dr. Rath Health Foundation, has been closely associated with Health Now, Inc., and founded the Dr. Rath Research Institute.\n\nThe \"Sunday Times (Johannesburg)\" has described Rath as an \"international campaigner for the use of natural remedies\" whose \"theories on the treatment of cancer have been rejected by health authorities all over the world.\" On HIV/AIDS, Rath has disparaged the pharmaceutical industry and denounced antiretroviral medication as toxic and dangerous, while claiming that his vitamin pills could reverse the course of AIDS. As a result, Rath has been accused of \"potentially endangering thousands of lives\" in South Africa, a country with a massive AIDS epidemic where Rath was active in the mid-2000s. The head of Médecins Sans Frontières said \"This guy is killing people by luring them with unrecognised treatment without any scientific evidence\"; Rath attempted to sue him.\n\nRath's claims and methods have been widely criticised by medical organisations, AIDS-activist groups, and the United Nations, among others. Former South African President Thabo Mbeki and former Minister of Health Manto Tshabalala-Msimang have also been criticised by the medical and AIDS-activist community for their perceived support for Rath's claims. According to doctors with Médecins Sans Frontières, the Treatment Action Campaign (a South African AIDS-activist group) and a former Rath colleague, unauthorised clinical trials run by Rath and his associates, using vitamins as therapy for HIV, resulted in deaths of some participants. In 2008, the Cape High Court found the trials unlawful, banned Rath and his foundation from conducting unauthorised clinical trials and from advertising their products, and instructed the South African Health Department to fully investigate Rath's vitamin trials. In 2008, Rath expanded his advertising to Russia, a country where the incidence of HIV/AIDS had been increasing.\n\nRath studied at the Hamburg University Medical School in Germany\nAfter graduating from Hamburg, Rath began researching arteriosclerosis at the University Clinic of Hamburg. Later, during 1989 and 1990, he was a researcher at the Berlin Heart Centre. He subsequently joined two-time Nobel Prize laureate Linus Pauling at his research institute in California. Ultimately, Rath had a falling-out with the Linus Pauling Institute; after a series of lawsuits and countersuits, Rath was ordered in 1994 to pay the Institute $75,000 and was assigned several patents. Rath subsequently developed his own branded nutrient products, set up the Dr. Rath Health Foundation and Dr. Rath Research Institute, and funds nutrition research with patent development in what he calls \"Cellular Medicine\".\n\nRath has offices in California, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and South Africa (Cape Town). His foundation also advertises its products in Spain, France, and Russia. According to Eversheds, Rath's solicitor, the Dr. Rath Health Foundation is \"a not-for-profit body which conducts research into science-based natural therapies,\" but the foundation is estimated to have earned \"millions\" through nutritional supplement sales.\n\nAccording to Rath, events of the last century in the international arena have been driven by pharmaceutical and oil companies. Rath claims that World War II was started and exploited by these interests. In court filings, Rath and his lawyers write that the pharmaceutical industry then started apartheid in South Africa as part of a global conspiracy to \"conquer and control the entire African continent.\" Former Nazi officials and the German chemical company IG Farben are specifically mentioned as playing a central role in the alleged conspiracy. In these documents, Rath also compares his adversaries in court to Hitler's storm troopers.\n\nRath suggests that the pharmaceutical industry continues to control international politics today, allowing 9/11 to occur and starting the Iraq War to divert attention from what Rath considers the failures of drug companies. On his website, Rath states that United States President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, at the behest of what Rath calls the \"pharmaceutical cartel\", were planning a nuclear war in advance of the 4 November 2008 elections in the United States. Rath has made similar claims in the \"New York Times\" and other major newspapers around the world in the form of large advertisements reportedly designed to resemble newspaper editorials.\n\nIn 2001, Rath was presented the Bulwark of Liberty Award by the health freedom advocacy groups the American Preventive Medical Association and the National Foundation for Alternative Medicine.\n\nRath's theories, claims, and research, particularly his efforts to persuade South Africans to use his vitamin supplements to treat HIV/AIDS, have been controversial.\n\nIn 2005, according to Reuters, Rath's foundation distributed tens of thousands of pamphlets in poor black South African townships, such as Khayelitsha, claiming that HIV medication was \"poison\" and urging HIV-positive people instead to use vitamins such as those Rath sells to treat HIV/AIDS. People with \"advanced AIDS\" were then recruited by the Rath Foundation and its surrogates for what the Rath Foundation called \"a clinical pilot study in HIVpositive patients\" Personnel of the South Africa National Civic Organisation (Sanco) administered the programme in Khayelitsha as \"agents for the Rath foundation.\"\n\nPatients were recruited for the study with offers of money or food, and were instructed to stop taking conventional HIV/AIDS medications. Luthando Nogcinisa, a local Communist Party official, said that Rath agents recruited known HIV-positive individuals, \"often with a pack of groceries, and they encourage the person not to take the antiretrovirals, but to rather take the vitamins\". Mike Waters, Democratic Alliance health spokesperson, states that Rath gave patients \"food parcels to convince them to give up their antiretrovirals and take his vitamin C supplements instead.\"\n\nRath Foundation employees reportedly infiltrated HIV/AIDS clinics in Khayelitsha and paid clinic staff to provide them with names of patients. \"The Guardian\" described a case in which a pregnant woman newly diagnosed with HIV was visited at home by Rath Health Foundation employees and convinced to stop taking her antiretroviral medication in favour of Rath's vitamins; she died 3 months later. The Rath Foundation disputed that patients were asked to stop taking effective antiviral medication. Rath's lawyers also claimed that the trial was actually a \"community nutrition programme\" to which Rath contributed vitamins.\n\nFive trial participants stated in affidavits that they were stripped to their underwear, photographed, and had blood drawn without their permission. They were told to take pills containing what were said to be high doses of vitamins, including Rath's \"VitaCell\". Demetre Labadarios, who leads the Human Nutrition programme at Stellenbosch University, questioned the safety of administering high doses of supplements to already-sick patients.\n\nDuring and immediately following the vitamin trials, \"many people died,\" deaths attributed by Rath's adversaries to a lack of effective medication. Sanco-Rath clinic workers reportedly instructed patients to return to the clinic in the event of medical emergency, rather than going to hospital.\n\nThe Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and the South African Medical Association (SAMA) took the Rath Foundation to court to prevent further unauthorised trials and to stop the foundation's claims that vitamins could treat or cure HIV/AIDS. Rath's lawyer however said that he had never claimed his vitamin products were a cure for HIV/AIDS, adding that Rath's only involvement in the affair was the donation of vitamins to the South African National Civics Organisation. TAC and SAMA prevailed in court over Rath and the Medicines Control Council on unauthorised trials and advertising of Rath's nutrients as a replacement therapy for HIV.\n\nIn September 2008, Rath was ordered to pay court costs in an unsuccessful libel action against \"The Guardian\" (UK) after the paper reported on his foundation's unauthorised drug trials in South Africa.\n\nIn 2004, the Swiss Study Group for Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer (SKAK), an independent group which evaluates alternative medical treatments, examined Rath's vitamin preparations and the marketing claims made by Rath. The Study Group reported that they \"found no proof that the vitamin preparations of Dr. Matthias Rath have any effect on human cancer\" and \"advise against their use in cancer prevention and treatment while recommending a diet rich in fruit and vegetables.\" Specifically, the Swiss Study Group report criticised Rath for:\n\n\nThe conclusion of the Swiss Study Group regarding Rath's vitamin formulations was:\n\nA cancer-curing effect has not been documented for any of these substances. Nor is there any proof that the preparations sold by Matthias Rath, some with high dosages, are useful in cancer prevention – leave alone curing cancer. Rath still owes proof regarding the correctness of his claims. Proof of effect cannot be provided by analogy with in vitro, animal or cell experiments. Because there is no proof for effect nor for the harmlessness of the preparations, SKAK advises against their use.\n\nTo support the use of multivitamins in HIV/AIDS, Rath has cited a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health, published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\", suggesting that multivitamin supplementation slows the progression of HIV to AIDS.\n\nIn May 2005, the study authors released a statement condemning Rath's \"irresponsible and misleading statements, as in our view they deliberately misinterpret findings from our studies to advocate against the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy.\" The study authors felt that Rath had misused their study results to argue that multivitamins should be used \"in place of\" antiretroviral medication. In their statement, the study authors affirmed the central role of antiretroviral medication in the treatment of AIDS, and indicated that multivitamins should be, at most, a \"supplementary\" treatment.\n\nA 1998 article in the \"British Medical Journal\" examined some of the claims made by Rath and Health Now in support of Rath's multivitamin supplement blend. The authors found that Rath listed 40 citations to support his product; however, on examination, only 8 of these citations were of actual clinical trials. After examining these clinical trials, the authors concluded that despite Rath's claims to the contrary, \"no general clinical benefit of vitamins C and E and carotene can be proved from the works cited by Health Now.\"\n\nRath's advertising material has suggested that his nutritional supplements are superior to antiretroviral therapy in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and implied that his claims were endorsed by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and UNAIDS. However, these agencies issued a joint statement condemning Rath's advertisements as \"wrong and misleading\".\n\nThe Democratic Alliance (DA), official opposition party in South Africa, said Rath was representing himself as a medical doctor in his literature distributed in South Africa, and claimed that this was against the law since he was not registered as a doctor in South Africa. The DA filed complaints with the Health Professions Council of South Africa and the police. The Health Professions Council said it could not discipline Rath since its jurisdiction is restricted to registered doctors.\n\nA lawyer representing Rath responded to the complaints by stating that the title 'Dr.' referred in Rath's case to \"a PHD doctorate he had obtained and his position as a researcher, not a medical doctor.\"\n\nOther sources, however, describe Rath as a \"qualified doctor\" and state that he \"became a researcher first at the University Clinic in Hamburg and then, during 1989 and 1990, at the Berlin Heart Centre.\"\n\nTo address the \"confusion\" created by Rath's advertising campaign, the South African Council of Churches issued a statement that Rath's activities in South Africa \"can only be interpreted as misguided strategies to promote Rath's own brand of nutritional supplements.\" The Council affirmed the importance of both antiretroviral medication and good nutrition for people with HIV, and pointed out that multivitamins are distributed by public health services and need not be obtained from Rath's organisation.\n\nRath has been involved in a number of legal cases.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2499287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2499287", "title": "Mist (comics)", "text": "Mist (comics)\n\nThe Mist is the name of two DC Comics supervillains, archenemies of the original and 1990s Starman.\n\nThe Kyle Nimbus version of Mist first appears in \"Adventure Comics\" #67 and was created by Gardner Fox.\n\nThe Nash Nimbus version of Mist first appears in \"Starman\" Vol. 2 #0 and was created by James Robinson and Tony Harris.\n\nThe first Mist's name was Kyle Nimbus. He fought in World War I as a Captain in the Canadian Army, winning the Victoria Cross. He was also a scientist and created a device that turned his body into a gaseous form; he became a supervillain, first fighting the Golden Age Sandman under the name 'Johnathon Smythe', before changing his name to the Mist. In 1941 he undertook a crimewave in Opal City and was stopped by Ted Knight, the Golden Age Starman; he vowed revenge on Starman and became his nemesis.\n\nHe was a member of the Ultra-Humanite's incarnation of the Secret Society of Super Villains, and appeared during the late 1980s \"Starman\" series (chronicling the adventures of Will Payton), then using the name Nimbus.\n\nThe Mist had two children named Nash and Kyle.\n\nIn the early 1990s after Ted Knight had retired (following the events of \"Zero Hour\"), the Mist planned his final revenge on Starman and sent his son, also named Kyle, to kill Knight's son David, as well as nearly killing his second son, Jack, demolishing his home and kidnapping the elder Knight. In exchange for his father, Jack battled the younger Kyle, resulting in the junior Kyle's death, which drove the Mist mad. He was like this for some time until making a deal with the demon Neron, restoring his sanity. This allowed him to advise his daughter on joining Simon Culp's scheme to destroy Opal City and conversely kill Culp himself when he threatened her, on the grounds he \"hated dwarfs\". Ultimately, he revealed he was tired and had decided to end his life, planting a nuclear bomb in Opal City set to detonate at the moment of his death and then taking poison. However he failed to destroy the city as a terminally ill Ted Knight used an advanced version of his gravity rod to lift the entire building miles into the air; the two enemies made peace just before the Mist's heart stopped, killing them both.\n\nWhat follows is an account of the Mist's history as it existed on the world of Earth-Two, prior to the consolidating of DC Comics' alternate Earths in the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" miniseries. Much of this can still be considered canon where it does not contradict later established information.\n\nJune 1962 saw Earth-Two's public re-emergence of Vandal Savage. He briefly terrorized a handful of important U.S. cities and was able to attack and incapacitate various members of the retired JSA.(\"Flash\" #137, 6.63) This brazen attack on major American cities and on the persons of a handful of retired JSAers resulted in the re-emergence and the re-formation of the Justice Society of America. This did not have an immediate effect on the super-scientists and criminals who operated openly in the 1940s and covertly in the 1950s, but over time this curious breed of villain did begin to re-emerge.\n\nSeptember 1965 found the Mist working with a gang of hoodlums along the Atlantic coast in Park City. With his secret formulas and gadetry he was controlling Mrs. Dinah Lance, using the Drake Flower Shoppe as the means to gain access to the wealthy citizenry, and using his hypnotic influence to have the rich rob themselves and hand over their wealth to the Mist's henchmen.\n\nThough Park City did have a protector in the guise of the Black Canary, this heroine was only seen infrequently and the Mist seemed not to have been perturbed by this. Though he was using Mrs. Lance he never discovered her dual identity as the Black Canary.\n\nBy September his crime spree was advancing nicely and was baffling the local police. Finally, a local private investigator – Mr. Larry Lance (and husband to Dinah Lance) figured out the connection between those robbed and his wife's flower shop. At about this time the Lance family was visited by their friend Ted Knight, he accidentally intercepted a hypnotic sound wave sent by the Mist. Together the three heroes went about hunting down the gang and the leader.\n\nDuring this crime spree, the Mist discovered how to use his inviso-solution, sound waves and a recording of motor noises from the Park City Observatory to block star-energy from reaching Starman's gravity rod, in effect making it powerless; however, Starman had with him a newer, quasar-powered rod which proved impervious to the deactivation. In the end the Mist and his men were defeated and handed over to the police. (\"The Brave & the Bold\" #61, 9.65)\n\nNash was not initially the villain that her father or brother were, but rather a meek, stuttering girl. During her father's campaign of revenge against Ted Knight she was in a position to kill Jack Knight, but let him go after he reasoned that she personally had no reason to kill him. However, after Jack killed her brother she underwent a major personality shift and became the second Mist, exposing herself to the same process that had transformed her father. During her first major crimewave she drugged Jack, had sex with him while he was unconscious and became pregnant. She later gave birth to a son, Kyle Theo. named after her father and Jack's. She passed on a second opportunity to kill Jack, deciding to better herself as a villain whilst Jack worked to become a better hero. She spent much time in Europe where she killed the second Amazing Man, Crimson Fox and Blue Devil. She was then one of the many villains who took part in the plan to destroy Opal City during the \"Grand Guignol\" storyline. After this failed, her father made his own attempt to destroy the city. Since his plan would kill Nash and her son, she attempted to stop him. Her father shot her and in her dying moments she gave her son over to Jack.\n\nBoth Mists are able to transform into a living vapor, becoming tangible and intangible at will.\n\nThe Kyle Nimbus version of Mist appears on \"The Flash\", portrayed by Anthony Carrigan. Nimbus is a mob hit-man, who was turned on by his employers and testified against. After being charged he was made a death row inmate who was being executed via gas chamber when the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator exploded, giving him his elemental abilities as he can literally transform into the gas that was being used to execute him. He begins executing people responsible for landing him in prison, the last attempt being Joe West, his arresting officer. The Flash is able to defeat The Mist after keeping him in his gas state for an overextended amount of time, weakening him to the point of unconsciousness. He was later locked in a makeshift cell in the converted particle accelerator turned metahuman prison. He is briefly seen again in the episode \"Power Outage\", but just in his mist form. He is shown again in the episode \"Rogue Air\" when he and the other prisoners manage to escape while being transferred from the particle accelerator prison to the island prison of Lian Yu.\n"}
{"id": "46611607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46611607", "title": "Naum Krnar", "text": "Naum Krnar\n\nNaum Krnar (; d. 13 July 1817) was the secretary of Karađorđe, the leader of the First Serbian Uprising. Krnar was an ethnic Greek, hailing from Thessaly. He spoke several languages and worked as a merchant in Belgrade. With the outbreak of the uprising, Krnar, who had enriched himself through the trade of leather and fur, immediately joined Karađorđe in the organization, and became his personal secretary and chairman in the Serbian Ruling Council (\"Praviteljstvujušči sovjet serbski\"). It is unknown whether he fled Serbia with Karađorđe after the suppression by the Ottomans in 1813. As many of the Serbian commanders, he found refuge in the Russian Empire. He was a founding member of the Filiki Eteria (1814). On 12 July 1817, on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, he and Karađorđe secretly crossed the Danube into Serbia, in order to continue the Serbian Revolution, however, the leader of the Second Serbian Uprising, Miloš Obrenović (who had stopped the rebellion in exchange for Ottoman autonomy), learnt of this and had them both beheaded, their heads sent to the Sultan in Constantinople. Karađorđe and Krnar stayed in a cottage in the village of Radovanj in the Smederevo \"nahija\". Nikola Novaković, a henchman of Vujica Vulićević, first killed the sleeping Karađorđe with an axe blow to the head, then shot Krnar, who was washing himself and getting water for Karađorđe in the river downwards from the cottage, with a rifle, on 13 July. Novaković beheaded both with his yatagan, and took them with him on horse to Kolare, and then to Belgrade, where he gave them to Miloš Obrenović. Obrenović in turn gave them to Marashli Ali Pasha who took them to Constantinople. The heads were on public display for seven days. They were then held at the Museum of Sciences in Istanbul. They say that Greeks later stole the heads, and took them to Athens to be held in a museum. The bodies of Karađorđe and Krnar were buried in a tomb in Radovanj by priest Jovan and Dragić Vojkić. The body of Karađorđe was transferred to Oplenac in 1919, while Krnar's body is still buried in the tomb.\n\nKrnar left a young son, Joca, after him. Joca took the surname \"Naumović\". Joca was handsome, tall, had black hair and moustache. He was serious, agreeable, a capable and correct officer. Joca was a cavalry officer, and later served as first adjutant of Aleksandar Karađorđević, with the rank of colonel, then served as a chief of an okrug. Pensioned, he died at 64 years of age on 28 December 1878 in Belgrade and was buried in the Church of St. Mark in Palilula. He had three sons (Mihailo, Mirko, Boja) and a daughter (Maca).\n\nThe rule of Alexander Obrenović (r. 1889–1903) was largely criticized, with dissatisfaction throughout the country. After a failed attempt to kill Obrenović, a military conspiracy group decided to stage the assassination at the royal palace. They recruited officers of the Royal Guard, including lieutenant colonel Mihailo Naumović, a grandson of Naum, who had sympathy toward the Karađorđević due to the murder of his grandfather ordered by Miloš Obrenović. The royal couple were assassinated in the May Coup (1903), which led to the reinstatement of the Karađorđević dynasty.\n\n"}
{"id": "6425353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6425353", "title": "Nosson Tzvi Finkel (Mir)", "text": "Nosson Tzvi Finkel (Mir)\n\nNosson Tzvi Finkel (12 March 1943 – 8 November 2011) was an American-born Haredi Litvish rabbi and rosh yeshiva (dean) of the Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem, Israel. During his tenure from 1990 until his death in 2011, the Mir Yeshiva grew into the largest yeshiva in Israel with nearly 6,000 undergraduate students and over 1,600 \"avreichim\" (married students). According to one estimate, he taught 25,000 students over his lifetime. Although he suffered from Parkinson's disease for the last 28 years of his life, experiencing involuntary spasms and slurred speech, he did not let his illness stop him from learning Torah for long hours, delivering regular \"shiurim\" (lectures), and fund-raising for his yeshiva around the world. He raised an estimated US$500 million for the Mir during his tenure as rosh yeshiva. He was a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Degel HaTorah. He was known for his Torah erudition and his warmth and concern for his students.\n\nNosson Tzvi Finkel was born in Chicago, Illinois to Rabbi Eliyahu Meir Finkel and his wife, Sara Rosenblum, who ran a kosher catering business. His paternal grandfather, Rabbi Avraham Shmuel Finkel, was a \"mashgiach ruchani\" at the Hebron yeshiva in Israel, and his paternal great-grandfather was the Alter of Slabodka, Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, after whom he was named. He had one brother, Gedaliah, who now teaches at the Mir yeshiva. After his parents immigrated to Israel in 1973, his mother published a best-selling kosher cookbook.\n\nReb Finkel grew up as a \"typical American Jewish boy\" who enjoyed playing basketball and baseball. He was known as Nathan in school and Natie to his friends. He was one of the first students of the Central Park Hebrew Day School (later renamed Arie Crown Day School) and received after-school tutoring in Torah studies from Rabbi Yehoshua Levinson. In 1957, at the age of 14, he accompanied his parents on a trip to Israel to visit the holy sites and his father's family. His great-uncle, Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (\"Reb Leizer Yudel\"), the Mir rosh yeshiva, recognized his ability to think clearly and have patience for studying, and asked his parents to let him stay and study in his yeshiva. Finkel remained at the Mir for eight months, studying with top-notch \"chavrutas\" (study partners) to develop his skills. He returned to Chicago to take his secondary education at the co-ed, Modern Orthodox Ida Crown Jewish Academy, where he was president of the student council and a starting centerfielder for the baseball team. At the age of 17, Finkel returned to Jerusalem to learn at the Mir under the guidance of his great-uncle. He learned diligently for the next six years. With one of his \"chavrutas\", Rabbi Zundel Kroizer, he completed the entire Talmud each year.\n\nIn the summer of 1964 Finkel married Reb Leizer Yudel's granddaughter, Leah, his second cousin and the eldest daughter of Rabbi Binyomin Beinush Finkel, who was his father's first cousin. He and his wife had 11 children. He continued to learn with \"chavrutas\" at all hours, stopping at 2 a.m.; his wife would bring their children to visit him at the yeshiva so he wouldn't have to take the time to walk home. He also began delivering \"shiurim\" in the yeshiva, which was headed by his father-in-law after the death of Reb Leizer Yudel in 1965. Upon the death of his father-in-law on 13 February 1990, Finkel was named rosh yeshiva of the Mir together with Rabbi Refoel Shmuelevitz (son of former Mir rosh yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Leib Shmuelevitz). Finkel took on the financial responsibility for the yeshiva.\n\nWhen Reb Finkel first came to the Mir at the age of 17 in 1960, enrollment was less than 200 students, of which 75 percent were \"avreichim\" (married students) and 25 percent were undergraduates. When he became rosh yeshiva in 1990, enrollment stood at approximately 1,200 students. At the time of his death, enrollment reached nearly 6,000 undergraduates and over 1,600 \"avreichim\". This growth is credited to Finkel's open-door policy as rosh yeshiva: whoever wished to learn at the Mir was welcome. Enrollment now includes Litvish, Hasidic, Ashkenazi, Sephardi and baalei teshuva students from Israel, the United States and Europe.\n\nTo accommodate the ever-increasing enrollment, Finkel fund-raised for and constructed four new buildings in addition to the original yeshiva building constructed by Reb Leizer Yudel in 1949. He assigned separate \"battei medrash\" (study halls) for each group of students, making one for Israeli students, one for Americans, one for those who wished to study without a daily \"shiur\", and so on. As enrollment continued to climb, several students of the main \"maggidei shiur\" (lecturers) began delivering \"shiurim\" in English, and Finkel raised the funds to open a new \"beis medrash\" in 2006 for these \"shiurim\" too. Yet another \"beis medrash\" was built in recent years. The Mir also opened a \"yeshiva gedola\" for Israeli students in the Brachfeld neighborhood of Modi'in Illit where Finkel gave \"shiurim\" and occasional \"shmuessen\" (musar talks), and a \"yeshiva ketana\" in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood of Jerusalem.\n\nIn an unusual move for a Litvish yeshiva, Finkel accepted 800 Hasidic students and allowed them to learn in their own \"chabura\" and follow their own customs, including a \"fartug\" (pre-dawn study session) before morning prayers. This group, known as \"Chaburas Ameilim BaTorah\" (the \"Toiling in Torah\" Study Group), was housed in a different neighborhood, but the week before his death, Finkel moved them onto Mir yeshiva premises. He participated in their Thursday-night study sessions as well as their \"seudot mitzvah\" (festival meals) marking a siyum, and Hanukkah parties.\n\nNotwithstanding the Mir's huge enrollment, Finkel tried to remember the name of each student. He also remembered personal details about each of his alumni and donors abroad. His brother-in-law, Rabbi Aharon Lopiansky, rosh yeshiva of the Yeshiva of Greater Washington, said that at Mir dinners, 1,000 people could be waiting to speak with the rosh yeshiva, \"and almost every single one on the line was someone he had had a personal connection with\".\n\nDespite his busy schedule, Finkel also expressed a willingness to learn in \"chavruta\" with any student who asked. It was estimated that he studied with approximately 80 people every week. Like his great-uncle Reb Leizer Yudel, Finkel offered cash incentives for Torah study, challenging his students to learn many pages of Talmud and study for large blocks of time. He regularly hosted siyums for students in his own home and at his own expense.\n\nFinkel shouldered the responsibility for raising funds for this giant Torah enterprise. Despite his disease and its side effects, he traveled twice a year to England and the United States. In the past two years, the economic recession saw the yeshiva's debts mounting quicker than they were being met, with salaries and kollel stipends running months behind. Finkel was said to be very upset by this state of affairs.\n\nReb Finkel was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the late 1980s. Though he experienced much difficulty in walking and talking, and suffered from involuntary tremors and spasms and slurred speech, he continued to learn for hours every day and gave regular \"shiurim\" in the yeshiva, as well as embarked on regular fund-raising trips abroad. In later years, when he felt too weak to sit in a chair during the \"chaburas\" (small-group learning sessions) that he organized for students in his home, he would lie down on a couch and encourage the students to begin the session. He refused to take medication for his condition, since the drugs could make his mind foggy or cause memory loss and he didn't want to risk forgetting his Torah studies. He only took medication that provided temporary relief from his symptoms.\n\nAt 6 a.m. in his home on November 8, 2011 (11 Cheshvan 5772), Finkel suddenly lost consciousness. EMS personnel attempted to revive him for 50 minutes while students of the Mir stood outside in the street praying for him. His personal doctor summoned to the home determined that he had died of cardiac arrest.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people attended his funeral, which began at the Mir yeshiva in Beit Yisrael and continued on foot to Har HaMenuchot, where he was buried next to Rabbi Chaim Shmuelevitz, a former rosh yeshiva of the Mir, and close by the graves of Reb Leizer Yudel and Rabbi Binyomin Beinish Finkel. The Edah HaChareidis ordered all Haredi businesses to close during the funeral, and Litvishe Torah leaders Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Aharon Leib Shteinman instructed teachers and students of Talmud Torahs, yeshivas, and kollels to join the funeral procession. The procession blocked the entrance to the city and halted operations of the Jerusalem Light Rail, as tens of thousands of mourners blocked the tracks on the Jerusalem Chords Bridge en route to the cemetery.\n\nRav Finkel's death was a double blow for the Jerusalem Litvish yeshiva world, coming one day after the death of Rabbi Dov Schwartzman, another respected Litvish rosh yeshiva in Jerusalem. Rabbi Finkel participated in Rabbi Schwartzman's funeral on 7 November.\n\nAt the funeral it was announced that Finkel's eldest son, Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel, would succeed his father as rosh yeshiva.\n\n"}

People assigned as payload specialists included individuals selected by the research community, a company or consortium flying a commercial payload aboard the spacecraft, and non-NASA astronauts designated by international partners.\n\nThe term refers to both the individual and to the position on the Shuttle crew.\n\nPayload specialists were generally selected for a single specific mission and were chosen outside the standard NASA astronaut selection process. They were not required to be United States citizens, but had to be approved by NASA and undergo rigorous training. In contrast, a Space Shuttle mission specialist was selected as a NASA astronaut candidate first and then assigned to a mission.\n\nPayload specialists on early missions were technical experts to accompany specific payloads such as a commercial or scientific satellite. On Spacelab and other missions with science components, payload specialists were scientists with expertise in specific experiments. The term also applied to representatives from partner nations who were given the opportunity of a first flight on board of the Space Shuttle (such as Saudi Arabia and Mexico), and to Congressmen and the Teacher in Space program.\n\nOther positions on board Space Shuttle were mission commander, pilot, and mission specialist. Unlike other Shuttle crew, international or scientific payload specialists were generally assigned a back-up who trained alongside the primary payload specialist and would replace him/her in the event of illness or other disability.\n\nPayload specialists were flown from 1983 (STS-9) to 2003 (STS-107). The last flown payload specialist was the first Israeli astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who was killed in the \"Columbia\" disaster on mission STS-107 with the rest of the crew.\n\nNASA's payload specialist program has been criticized for giving limited Shuttle flight positions to civilian aerospace engineers such as Greg Jarvis (killed aboard \"Challenger\"), politicians such as US Representative Bill Nelson, and others civilians such as Teacher in Space Christa McAuliffe (also killed aboard \"Challenger\"). Even the rationale for the Shuttle flight of former Mercury astronaut and US Senator John Glenn was questioned. The concern was that these people had replaced career astronauts in very limited flight opportunities, and some may have flown without understanding the level of danger.\n\nA 1986 post-\"Challenger\" article in \"The Washington Post\" reviewed the issue, reporting that as far back as 1982, NASA was concerned with finding reasonable justifications for flying civilians on the Shuttle as was directed by the Reagan administration. The article says that \"A review of records and interviews with past and present NASA and government officials shows the civilian program's controversial background, with different groups pushing for different approaches.\" The article concludes with:\n\n\"This section needs to be completed\"\nWubbo Ockels, Michael Lampton\nRobert W.

{"id": "647880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=647880", "title": "Ramzan Kadyrov", "text": "Ramzan Kadyrov\n\nRamzan Akhmadovich Kadyrov (, \"Q̇adar Aẋmat-khant Ramzan\"; born 5 October 1976) is the Head of the Chechen Republic and a former member of the Chechen independence movement.\n\nHe is the son of former Chechen President Akhmad Kadyrov, who was assassinated in May 2004. In February 2007, Kadyrov replaced Alu Alkhanov as President, shortly after he had turned 30, which is the minimum age for the post. He was engaged in violent power struggles with Chechen government warlords Sulim Yamadayev and Said-Magomed Kakiyev for overall military authority, and with Alkhanov for political authority.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov is an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. He founded the Akhmat Fight Club and established an international annual freestyle wrestling tournament called the Ramzan Kadyrov & Adlan Varayev Cup. Since November 2015, he is a member of the Advisory Commission of the State Council of the Russian Federation.\n\nOver the years, he has come under criticism of international organisations for a wide array of human rights abuses under his watch, with Human Rights Watch calling the forced disappearances and torture so widespread they constituted crimes against humanity. He has also been criticized in Western press for his advocacy for restricted public lives for women, and a campaign of mass detention for those who are suspected to have engaged in homosexual behavior.\n\nHe was born in Tsentaroy, RSFSR, USSR. He was the second son in Akhmat and Aimani Kadyrovs' family and their youngest child. He had an elder brother called Zelimkhan (1974 – 31 May 2004), and he has two elder sisters, Zargan (born 1971) and Zulay (born 1972). Kadyrov strove to gain the respect of his father, Akhmad Kadyrov, who was an imam. He claims that he always emulated his father. Akhmad had supported the call for jihad against Russians during the First Chechen War but switched sides and declared allegiance to Russia in the Second Chechen War. In the early 1990s, as the Soviet Union dissolved, the Chechens launched a bid for independence.\n\nDuring the First Chechen War, together with his father, he fought against Russian armed forces. After the war, Ramzan was the personal driver and bodyguard of his father Akhmad, who became the separatist mufti of Chechnya.\n\nThe Kadyrovtsy militia was formed during the First Chechen War when Akhmad Kadyrov launched the jihad against Russia.\n\nThe Kadyrov clan defected to the Moscow side at the beginning of the Second Chechen War in 1999. Since then, Kadyrov led his militia with support from Russia's FSB state security service (including service ID cards) becoming the head of the Chechen Presidential Security Service. The militia later became known as the Kadyrovites.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov was falsely rumoured to have died of a gunshot wound inflicted by his bodyguard on 28 April 2004.\n\nAfter his father, then President, was assassinated on 9 May 2004, Ramzan was appointed as the First Deputy Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic on 10 May 2004.\n\nWhen his sister was detained by the Dagestan police in January 2005, Ramzan and some 150 armed men drove to the Khasavyurt City Police (GOVD) building. According to the city mayor, Kadyrov's men surrounded the GOVD, forcing its duty officers against a wall, and assaulted them, after which they left the building with Zulay Kadyrova, \"victoriously shooting in the air.\"\n\nIn August 2005, Ramzan declared that \"Europe's largest mosque\" would be built in place of the demolished ruins of Grozny's shattered downtown. He also claimed that Chechnya is the \"most peaceful place in Russia\" and in a few years it would also be \"the wealthiest and the most peaceful\" place in the world. He said that the war was already over with only 150 \"bandits\" remaining (as opposed to the official figures of 700 to 2,000 rebel fighters), and that thanks to his father, 7,000 separatists had already defected to the Russian side since 1999. When responding to a question on how he is going to \"avenge the murder of his father\", Ramzan said:\nHe remained the First Deputy Prime Minister until November 2005.\n\nFollowing a car accident in November 2005, in which Chechnya's prime minister Sergey Abramov was injured, Ramzan was appointed as the caretaker prime minister on 18 November 2005. He immediately proceeded to implement elements of Sharia law, such as declaring a ban on gambling and alcohol production.\n\nIn February 2006, responding to the publication of the Mohammed cartoons, he accused the Danes of \"spying\" and being \"pro-terrorist\". He also banned Danish citizens from entering Chechnya, effectively banning activity of the Danish Refugee Council, the largest NGO working in the region. Kadyrov is quoted as saying, \"That cartoonist needs to be buried alive.\" He was eventually pressed to overturn this decision by Moscow, a rare example of federal intervention in Kadyrov's rule in the republic.\n\nOn 1 March 2006, Sergey Abramov resigned from the position of prime minister and told Itar-Tass news agency that he did so \"on the condition that Ramzan Kadyrov lead the Chechen government.\" This was followed by a decree of Kadyrov forcing women to wear headscarves; he also rejected a federal appropriation of the republic's budget, demanding more money, and called for all federal forces but the border guards to be withdrawn.\n\nKadyrov was appointed as the Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic by Alkhanov on 4 March 2006. Shortly after taking office, Kadyrov approved a project to erect a presidential palace on a plot by the Sunzha River in ruined downtown Grozny. The project, which was also to include a five-star hotel and recreational facilities, was estimated to cost around 1.5 billion rubles ($54 million USD) to build. Later, Kadyrov called for refugee camps scattered across Chechnya to be closed down, calling the refugees \"international spies who are interested in stoking conflict between Chechnya and Russia, who are seeking to destabilise the situation in our region\". Reuters quoted him as saying that \"liquidating the refugee camps will allow us to uncover spies who are working for foreign intelligence services\". His cousin Odes Baysultanov was appointed to the position of First Deputy Prime Minister by Alkhanov on 6 March 2006 after being unanimously approved by the Chechen Parliament.\n\nOn 5 June 2006, Speaker of the Chechen People's Assembly Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov said at a press conference in Moscow that \"there is no alternative\" to Kadyrov for the presidency; Kadyrov has \"exclusive awards in combat, and has made achievements in improving the peaceful life and in human rights protection. Who could replace him at this stage? Nobody,\" he said. Later that year, Umar Dzhabrailov, Chechnya's representative in the Federation Council and a close ally of Kadyrov's, urged Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov to initiate a measure calling on Kadyrov to become the republic's president, thereby replacing Alu Alkhanov. The following week, several Russian newspapers reported that a worsening security situation in Chechnya was lessening the likelihood that Kadyrov would replace Alu Alkhanov as the republic's president. Other media, however, reported that Kadyrov continued to strengthen his position at Alkhanov's expense. He was also elected as the Chair of the Chechen Peoples' Assembly in late-October 2006.\n\nOn 6 December 2006, Kadyrov said he that he would seek the prosecution of the commanders of federal military units responsible for the death or disappearance of civilians in Chechnya (specifically Major General Aleksandr Studenikin). In addition, Kadyrov said the war in Chechnya was unleashed not by the Chechen people but by the Russian leadership. Kadyrov's comments may have represented his government's increasing unhappiness with certain figures in Moscow, who were said to be blocking his elevation to the post of Chechen president. In 2006, leaked cables from an American diplomat recounted a lavish wedding attended by Kadyrov in Russia's Caucasus region in which guests threw $100 bills at child dancers, and which had nighttime \"water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea\", and a report that Ramzan Kadyrov gave the newly married couple a \"five-kilo lump of gold\".\n\nOn 5 February 2007, Kadyrov said he did not aspire to become the Chechen president; however, he criticised Alkhanov. Kadyrov also claimed the war in Chechnya was ultimately finished, with \"all informal armed groups eliminated\". Alkhanov, for his part, criticised \"the cult of personality and idealisation of one person\", a clear reference to Kadyrov, whose enormous portraits are prominently displayed in Grozny.\n\nOn 15 February 2007, Putin signed a decree removing Alkhanov and installing Kadyrov as Chechen's acting president. On 2 March 2007, following Putin's nomination of Kadyrov as Chechen president, the Chechen parliament approved the nomination. In the following days, serious changes took place in the administrative setup of the republic, affecting both the top- and middle-ranking officials. Former deputy prime minister Odes Baysultanov (a cousin of Kadyrov) was elevated to the vacant post of prime minister. Critics allege that Ramzan Kadyrov is actively building his own \"vertical of power\" in the republic, and encouraging nepotism by placing men of the Beno clan in all the leading and important positions.\n\nA Russian daily, \"Gazeta\", reported that according to a poll conducted by the independent Levada Center, only 33 percent of Russians believe that Ramzan Kadyrov can be trusted, while 35 percent believed that he cannot. Asked whether they thought Kadyrov could normalise the situation in Chechnya and end the bloodshed there, 31 percent said yes and 38 percent said no.\n\nOn 14 March 2007, Kadyrov said that human rights abuses were \"a thing of the past\" in his republic, rejecting new charges of torture made by the Council of Europe. Two days later he accused the federal authorities of torturing detainees. On 19 March 2007, Kadyrov vowed to put an end to all remaining guerilla activity in Chechnya within two months. On 5 April 2007, Kadyrov was sworn in as President of Chechnya. He appointed his maternal cousin Odes Baysultanov as the Prime Minister of the republic on 10 April.\n\nAfter the car-bomb attack on Yunus-bek Yevkurov, president of the neighbouring Republic of Ingushetia on 22 June 2009, Kadyrov claimed that the Kremlin had ordered him to fight insurgents there, and during his subsequent visit to the republic on 24 June pledged ruthless vengeance.\n\nIn late December 2009, Kadyrov claimed that remaining rebels were getting financed by \"The West\"; \"I officially declare this: those who destroyed the Soviet Union, those who want to destroy the Russian Federation, they stand behind them\". He also suggested that Russia should attack Georgia and Ukraine \"It's Russia's private affliction; why should we always suffer if we can eradicate this for good?\". In early August 2010, Kadyrov had claimed that there were only 70 Islamist militants left in Chechnya. In the same month, he proposed changing the title of \"President of the Chechen Republic\" to \"Head of the Chechen Republic\". On 12 August, he also called upon presidents of all North Caucasus republics to petition the State Duma to change their titles, stating that there should only be one president in Russia. The Chechen parliament unanimously approved this change on 2 September. However, Speaker of the Chechen Parliament Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov stated on the next day that the title will be retained until the end of Kadyrov's term in April 2011.\n\nIn February 2011, he invited the players of Brazil's 2002 FIFA World Cup winning team to play a match against a Chechen football team led by Kadyrov. The Brazilian team was named as Brazil XI. In addition, Ruud Gullit was hired by Kadyrov to train FC Terek Grozny.\n\nAs reported by the Caucasian Knot, an independent human rights resource, on 5 February 2009, \"in the course of his meeting in Grozny with Ramzan Ampukaev, representative of the Chechen Diaspora in Europe, Ramzan Kadyrov invited former militants, now living in Europe, to come back home\":\n\nIn 2010, two large scale attacks were carried out by Chechen insurgents, one in Kadyrov's home-village Tsentoroy and the other on Chechen Parliament in Grozny. The assault on Tsentoroy which occurred on 29 August is considered to have \"shattered\" the image of Kadyrov's unshakeable rule in Chechnya, as it was the first time in six years that his seemingly impregnable village had come under attack. On 2 September, Ramzan Kadyrov announced a reward of more than $300,000 for information about each of the insurgency leaders involved in the operation, which Chechen commentators interpreted as an indicator of the government's weakness. Kadyrov also tightened his control over information coming from Tsentoroy by not allowing any of the village's 5,000 inhabitants to leave in the days after the attack; the citizenry were also allegedly under the threat of death not to talk about the siege or the damage inflicted by the rebels. The attack on the Chechen parliament was carried out by three Chechen rebels on 19 October 2010. Kadyrov dressed in a parade uniform attended a meeting that was held a few hours after all the buildings of the parliament were declared cleared by the special forces. During the meeting, he apologised to the politicians who escaped unhurt from the attack. Kadyrov vowed to intensify the fight against militants in the republic, calling them \"bandits\". He also blamed the United Kingdom and Poland saying they were \"harbouring criminals. Why do they shield bandits who have shed blood where there is western democracy? Where is the justice? ... Sooner or later Zakayev, Gakayev, Umarov, Vadalov and other criminals will get what they deserve ... I have no doubt that it was the drunk and alcoholic Akhmed Zakayev and his backers in London and other western capitals. I want to say that they will not achieve anything. The Chechen republic is still standing. It is a peaceful and stable region.\"\n\nKadyrov was nominated by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 28 February 2011 and was unanimously elected for a second term by the Chechen Parliament on 5 March 2011. After his election, he stated that he was going to continue the current course of reviving the republic's economy and society.\n\nOn 8 March, he captained a Chechen football team which included current players of FC Terek Grozny, former players of Soviet Union national football team and former German midfielder Lothar Matthaeus in a match against the team Brazil XI which included ex-Brazilian footballers like Romario, Dunga, Bebeto and Cafu. Kadyrov scored twice during the match but his team lost 6–4 to the Brazilian side. Kadyrov said that he had organised the match to show that Chechnya had recovered from years of separatist conflict. He also said that the Brazilians weren't paid to appear but came out of goodwill and in return for a donation to flood victims in Brazil.\n\nKadyrov was sworn in as head of the republic on 5 April 2011. In November 2012, he visited Azerbaijan to sign intergovernmental agreements. In December 2012, he ordered the closure of the newspaper \"Kadyrov's Path\" after one of its reporters asked Putin a question about the violence once focused in Chechnya spreading to other republics and followed it up by asking about the fate of a local radio station. Kadyrov had reportedly taken a disliking to the question asked by the reporter to Putin.\n\nKadyrov termed former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster as a \"coup d'etat\" and a deliberate attempt to exert pressure on Russia through Ukraine, however at the same time placed the blame on Yanukovych for the situation in Ukraine. On 28 February 2014, he affirmed his readiness to dispatch peacekeepers and a consignment of humanitarian aid to Crimea.\n\nAfter the 2014 Grozny bombing, in which ISIL's hand was suspected, he said that he might block internet in Chechnya as anyone could easily find and listen to a sermon by a jihadist. After Kadyrov went on a tirade against ISIL on Instagram for threatening Russia, ISIL commander Omar al-Shishani put a $5 million bounty on him.\n\nOn 26 May 2015, he announced that he was going to star in a Hollywood thriller titled \"Whoever Doesn't Understand Will Get It\" which will be directed by a director of famous Hollywood films and also feature global film-stars. Kadyrov in July 2015 denied that ISIL had any territory in Chechnya and claimed that they never will. During an interview in October 2015, he suggested that Putin should send Chechen special forces to Syria claiming they will wipe out ISIL in weeks. On 3 December, he promised revenge against ISIL for beheading of Magomed Khasiev. On 8 February 2016, he claimed that Chechen special forces had infiltrated ISIL cells.\n\nKadyrov announced on 27 February 2016 that he would step down at the end of his second term, which was set to expire on 5 April. However, he later decided to run in the elections that were to be held that September. Putin appointed him as the acting head of Chechnya until the elections in a decree signed on 25 March. He held a meeting with Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman's deputy Ahmed al-Khatib on 8 May relating to Saudi Arabia investing in projects in Chechnya and declared that relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia were at an \"all-time high\".\n\nKadyrov launched his reality show titled \"The Team\" with the first episode being aired by Channel One on 30 June. People from across Russia were invited by Kadyrov to register for the contest. The winner of the contest will go on to become head of Chechnya's Agency for Strategic Development.\n\nOn 18 September 2016, Kadyrov was re-elected with nearly 98% of the vote. Philip Varychenko, a native of Düsseldorf, was chosen as the winner of Kadyrov's reality show on 22 November and was appointed as a government aide. Kadyrov visited Saudi Arabia on 27 November where he met the Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. During the meeting, they discussed Russia–Saudi Arabia relations as well as issues of common interest. He also visited the United Arab Emirates on the same day and met Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. The two discussed friendship, cooperation and strengthening ties. During his visits, he praised King Salman of Saudi Arabia for his \"leadership of the Muslim world and efforts to combat extremism\".\n\nOn 28 November, he stated that veterans of American special forces would not be allowed to train security and intelligence personnel at a \"tactical city\" in Gudermes because \"they weren't as good as Russian special forces and there were sanctions against all official structures from the United States.\" On 29 November, he claimed in an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat that only a few dozen Chechens were fighting with ISIL, adding that most of them grew up in Western Europe. He also stated that measures taken by Chechen authorities had been successful in bringing back many young recruits before they reached Syria.\n\nDuring an interview aired on 27 November 2017, Kadyrov stated that he was ready to resign as Head of the Chechen Republic, calling it his \"dream\" as he found the responsibility to be \"too heavy\". He announced on 5 December that no Chechen athletes will participate under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics.\n\nAfter an attack on the Church of Archangel Michael in Grozny on 19 May 2018, Kadyrov stated that he had personally overseen the operation to eliminate the attackers.\n\nIn 2006, the production of Chechnya's industry increased by 11.9%. In 2007, the rate of growth was 26.4%.\n\nIn February 2010, head of the British delegation of the Human Rights Group Lord Judd, formerly \"bitterly critical of the Russian authorities for the situation in Chechnya\", pointed out a striking change for the better in the Russian North Caucasus republic. Judd said that changes which occurred since his visit as a member of PACE delegation in 2000 were \"so overwhelming that sometimes you forget about what happened here until quite recently\".\n\nAccording to a 2016 report by Russian opposition leader Ilya Yashin, Kadyrov collected enormous wealth, primarily through theft of federal subsidies for Chechnya. Between 2001 and 2014 Chechnya has received over 464 billion roubles in subsidies, grants and donations with federal subsidies accounting for 80% of the republic's budget (and this does not include funds allocated for infrastructure managed at federal level such as roads). However, the administration of Chechnya is being criticized for spending public funds for their personal benefit—in 2010 Dmitry Medvedev noted that \"federal funds often do not reach people; we know where they disappear; it is obvious-they are being stolen\". For example, the fleet of official vehicles in Chechnya accounts for half of all official vehicles in all Northern Caucasus republics. Public funds are being funnelled through Akhmad Kadyrov Foundation, which—while being registered as a charity—has never produced or published any financial reports as required by Russian law. These violations are ignored by Russian Ministry of Justice, which in many cases has enforced them very strictly against other charities. The foundation operates a building company that services most of the publicly procured infrastructure projects in the republic and also collects a fee from all working citizens of Chechnya, ranging from 10 to 30% of their earnings, raising 3–4 billion roubles per year this way. Kadyrov himself declares annual income of 4.84 million roubles (2015), which is inconsistent with his lavish life-style, luxury vehicles, watches, race horses and mansions.\n\nAn assassination attempt on Kadyrov and a parliament member Adam Delimkhanov was averted on 23 October 2009, by the police. Chechen Deputy interior minister Roman Edilov said the police shot dead the driver of a speeding car loaded with a 200-litre tank after firing warning shots shortly before Kadyrov was to arrive at a construction site. The driver of the car was later identified as a militant leader (so-called Urus-Martan emir Beslan Bashtayev). Said-Emi Khizriev, who played a role in organising the attack, was killed by Russian police who tried to arrest him in the Michurin village in Grozny. Khizriev planned and took part in explosions at two gas stations in Gudermes in the spring of the previous year, as well as in an armed attack at a sport club in the city.\n\nKadyrov has been personally implicated in several instances of torture and murder. A number of Chechens opposed to Kadyrov have been assassinated abroad, and several witnesses (including Artur Kurmakaev and Ruslan Khalidov) report the existence of a 300 name \"Murder List\". Chechens who have been murdered, where Kadyrov's involvement is suspected, include Movladi Baisarov and Ruslan Yamadaev (both Moscow); Sulim Yamadaev (Dubai); Gazhi Edilsutanov, Islam Dzahnibekov, Ali Osaev (Istanbul); and Umar Israilov (Vienna).\n\nKadyrov stated in December 2009 that he had personally helped many of the murder victims and their families and was not their enemy. \"I don't want to kill, who did I fight? I fought terrorists. Who did I protect? I protected the whole of Russia so that people in Moscow or St. Petersburg...could live in peace. They accuse me of killing women and children. It's not true.\"\n\n\nKadyrov has previously encouraged extrajudicial killings of homosexual men by family members as an alternative to law enforcement – in some cases, gay men in prison have been released early specifically to enable their murder by relatives.\n\nIn April 2017, international media reported that gay men in Chechnya were being arrested, detained and tortured as part of a region-wide pogrom. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on 5 May that he would personally ask the Russian Prosecutor General and Interior Ministry to help Kremlin rights ombudswoman Tatyana Moskalkova check the reported abuse. UK Deputy Foreign Secretary Sir Alan Duncan told the UK Parliament he had been informed of alleged plans to eliminate Chechnya's gay community by the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which commenced on 26 May 2017.\n\nChechnya has denied the reports, with its interior minister calling the allegations an \"April Fools' joke\". Kadyrov's spokesman Alvi Karimov rejected the allegations and described the report in the Russian newspaper, \"Novaya Gazeta\", as \"absolute lies and disinformation\", basing his denial on the claim that \"you cannot detain and persecute people who simply do not exist in the republic. If there were such people in Chechnya, the law-enforcement organs wouldn't need to have anything to do with them because their relatives would send them somewhere from which there is no returning.\" Vladimir Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said that there had been no evidence found to support the allegations, adding that he had no reason to doubt Kadyrov's claims that no one under his rule has been persecuted for their sexual orientation.\n\nIn an interview with HBO's Real Sports aired on 18 July, Kadyrov said that, if there are any, Chechen gays should be moved to Canada, and claimed that pro-LGBT lobbyists are devils.\n\nOn 20 December 2017, the United States imposed sanctions under the Magnitsky Act on five Russian nationals including Kadyrov, accusing him of personal involvement in repression, torture and murder. U.S. officials accused him of heading \"an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings,\" and that one or more of his political opponents were killed at his direction. He was added to United States Department of the Treasury's blacklist which also included a Chechen security official Ayub Kataev along with three other Russian individuals for their criminal involvement in a corruption case uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky.\n\nIn response, Kadyrov mocked the sanctions on his Instagram account. \"A sleepless night is waiting for me.\" He further stated, \"I can be proud that I'm out of favor with the special services of the USA,\" and added, \"In fact, the USA cannot forgive me for dedicating my whole life to the fight against foreign terrorists among which there are bastards of America's special services.\"\n\nPresident Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the sanctions \"illegal\" and \"unfriendly\" stating, \"We consider these sanctions illegal, we consider them unfriendly, and we do not agree with them.\" He also stated that it was highly probable that Russia would retaliate by accusing U.S. officials or citizens of rights violations and banning them from the country.\n\nThe number of subscribers to Kadyrov's social networks in 2016 was more than three million people, including three million followers of his Instagram account, according to the Chechen leader's press service. It said that he had 500,000 followers on the Russian VK social network, 760,860 on Facebook, 331,000 on Twitter and 5,447 on LiveJournal. Besides his Instagram postings, it was said that he had also made almost 5,000 on Twitter and 2,300 on VK. The Russian News Agency TASS said that Kadyrov had been \"recognized as the most quoted Russian blogger.\"\n\nIn August 2016, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Kadyrov had posted nearly 8,000 pictures on Instagram, which made him the online mobile photo-sharing, video-sharing, and social networking service's \"most prolific political strongman.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" called Kadyrov's Instagram account \"bizarre if strangely compelling\", and \"Newsweek\" said it was \"flashy.\" In a 2015 article, \"The New York Times\" said that Kadyrov was \"Instagram-addicted.\"\n\nThe Russian programme director of Human Rights Watch said in an October 2016 article in \"The Guardian\" that \"even the mildest criticism on social media [is] ruthlessly punished through unlawful, punitive detention, enforced disappearances, cruel and degrading treatment, death threats, threats against family members, and physical abuse of family members.\" She said that a social worker from a small town in Chechnya made a WhatsApp recording that went viral among Chechen users \"imploring\" Kadyrov \"to look into the plight of ordinary people pushed below the poverty line\" by local officials. The article stated that the woman, with her husband, \"found herself hauled into the studio of Grozny TV, the state television and radio broadcaster\" to face Kadyrov in person, \"to apologise publicly for her lies.\" A \"severe and sweeping repression by the local authorities is designed to remind the Chechen public of Kayrov's total control,\" the article claimed.\n\nIn May 2015, Kadyrov gave a stern televised lecture to a group of Chechen men and women who were accused of using the WhatsApp messaging service to comment on the impending marriage of local police chief to a teenage girl some three decades younger than him. The wedding had been widely discussed across Russia on reports that the young woman, Kheda Goylabiyeva, was being coerced into marriage with the chief, Nazhud Guchigov.\n\n\"Behave like Chechens\", Kadyrov was reported as telling the assemblage of about a dozen people standing in the marbled courtyard of a building that seemed to be his government palace. \"Honor of the family is the most important thing. Don't write such things any more. You, men, keep your women away from WhatsApp.\" In its coverage of the incident, \"The New York Times\" reported:\n\n\"Lock them in, do not let them go out, and they will not post anything\", Mr. Kadyrov said in a video to a sheepish group of men and women who kept their arms folded across their chests and their eyes firmly on the ground during the harangue.\n\nIn December 2015, a female Chechen social worker criticised Kadyrov in an audio message posted on WhatsApp, after her boss tried to force her to put aside some money as collateral for her next month's payment. Three days after posting the message, she appeared on Grozny TV along with her husband, where she was publicly berated by Kadyrov as well as parliament speaker Magomed Daudov, presidential administration head Islam Kadyrov and her boss. The couple apologised on live television for her message.\n\nIn May 2016, Kadyrov engaged in a brief Instagram dispute with comedian John Oliver.\n\nHe had posted a message on Instagram asking for help in finding his cat, which had gone astray. The posting led Oliver to make a five-minute segment on HBO's \"Last Week Tonight\" dealing with the cat's disappearance and, according to \"The Guardian,\" Kadyrov's penchant for posting of, for example, \"regular videos of his work-outs in the gym,\" also on Instagram. As well, Oliver teased Kadyrov \"for his propensity\" to wear T-shirts bearing the image of Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the show, Oliver posted a photo of himself holding a cat, captioned \"@RKadyrov Is this your cat?\"\n\nKadyrov responded in English, according to \"The New York Times\" – or a \"rambling\" one, according to the \"Daily Mail\" – along with a doctored photo of Oliver wearing a Putin T-shirt, captioned, in part, \"I am tired of jokes. I want to care for cats in Chechnya. By the way, Putin is our leader.\"\n\nKadyrov stated that he found his Russian-language Instagram and Facebook accounts were not working on December 23, 2017, and he never received a response from Instagram after sending a request for service support. His English-language Instagram account remained unaffected however. Kadyrov accused them of bowing to pressure from United States after he was sanctioned.\nHe wrote on Telegram in response, \"Instagram's move, which still wants to pretend it is independent from officials of Washington is weird.\" He added, \"They wanted to stir my indignation, but were wrong, and this is the only thing which pleases me in actions Instagram and their patrons in the White House are undertaking. I have planned already to quit the network. But I thought I could fail my friends and subscribers, as on Instagram and Facebook I have more than 4 million followers.\"\nThe Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin stated that the decision by Facebook and Instagram to suspend Kadyrov's accounts violated his rights, stating, \"They are afraid of a public conversation and the truth. Such decision cannot be explained in another way… The thing is that to read bloggers in social networks one needs to be their subscribers. By deleting an account, they deprive citizens of their right to know about bloggers’ opinion and to communicate with them.\"\n\nRussia's telecommunications overseer Roskomnadzor on 26 December asked Facebook to explain why they had suspended his accounts. Facebook issued a statement on 28 December that it did so after he was sanctioned by United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control as these came under trade sanctions.\n\nOn 12 March 2006, a Chechen separatist website posted a short video shot on a mobile phone of a party in a sauna involving two alleged prostitutes and several men, including one who looked and sounded like Ramzan Kadyrov, seen dancing with a young, half-naked woman and trying to rip her bra off. Another man then starts masturbating in front of them. Andrew Osborn, Moscow reporter for \"The Independent\", reported that \"Mr Kadyrov's aides have laughed off the grainy video ... as a 'provocation'\".\n\nOn 3 November 2009, a horse owned by Ramzan Kadyrov, Mourilyan, came third in the Melbourne Cup winning about US$380,000 in prize money. The leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Bob Brown, immediately called for the Government of Australia to quarantine the prize money until assurances are received as to how the money will be used. Concerns had been previously raised that the Melbourne Cup could be used to launder money by overseas individuals.\n\nIn 2009, Kadyrov stated his approval of honor killings, based on the belief that women are the property of their husbands. In an interview with David Scott of HBO, he condoned honor killings of homosexuals in July 2017 stating, \"If we have [gay] people here, I'm telling you officially their relatives won't let them be because of our faith, our mentality, customs, traditions. Even if it's punishable under the law, we would still condone it.\"\n\nOn 28 November 2010, a classified Wikileaks cable named Kadyrov as a \"starring guest\" at some of Dagestan's most elaborate weddings, which indicates the political \"Caucasus power structure\" in these weddings. In 2006, leaked cables from an American diplomat recounted a lavish wedding attended by Kadyrov in Russia's Caucasus region in which guests threw $100 bills at child dancers, and which had nighttime \"water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea\", and a report that Ramzan Kadyrov gave the newly married couple a \"five-kilo lump of gold\".\n\nIn January 2015, Kadyrov said he would organize protests if a Russian newspaper published the \"Charlie Hebdo\" cartoons, saying \"we will not allow anyone to insult the Prophet [Muhammad], even if it will cost us our lives.\" He also stated that Alexei Venediktov \"will be brought to account\" after his radio station Ekho Moskvy took a survey of readers on whether to publish the cartoons. Venediktov stated he would ask the authorities to intervene against Kadyrov's threats. During a protest rally against the cartoons attended by hundreds of thousands of people in Chechnya, he accused those backing Charlie Hebdo of using \"false slogans about free speech and democracy\".\n\nKadyrov supports polygamy in Muslim-majority republics in Russia, and believes that Muslims who speak out against the practise are not true adherents to their faith. According to Kadyrov, men legally marrying more than one wife would be more honest than having lots of mistresses, and would resolve Russia's demographic problem. In April 2018, he stated that all Muslim men are permitted by Allah to have four wives but discouraged having the marriages officially registered. He also denied reports that polygamy would be legalised in Chechnya.\n\nAfter the Boston Marathon bombing, Kadyrov expressed sadness for the victims but denied the suspects had any ties to his region in a statement on his Instagram. He suggested that the suspects were products of American upbringing. Kadyrov accused the CIA of framing Dzokhar Tsarnaev on 18 March 2015, after he was handed a death sentence for the Boston Marathon Bombing and said that they could not have conducted the bombing without CIA's knowledge.\n\nOn 31 January 2016, Kadyrov posted a video of Russian opposition politicians Mikhail Kasyanov and Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza in the crosshairs of a gun on his Instagram blog. In a few days after multiple complaints Instagram removed the video prompting Kadyrov to criticize the decision: \"This is the much-boasted freedom of speech in America! You can write anything but cannot touch those American dogs, those friends of the Congress and the State Department\".\n\nRussian opposition leader Ilya Yashin authored a report against Kadyrov released on 23 February 2016 during a press conference which was repeatedly interrupted by police and hecklers. He also claimed that Kadyrov had murdered Boris Nemtsov. The report titled \"A National Security Threat\" claimed that Kadyrov poses a threat to Russia. It included allegations of corruption, authoritarian rule, secret prisons, rigging votes in favour of Vladimir Putin, stealing from the country's national budget to enrich himself, enforcing Sharia law over Russian law, his lavish lifestyle, building and maintaining a personal army of about 30,000 fighters, purported ties to organised crime figures, and his involvement in politically motivated murders of journalists, human rights activists and political opponents. The report also contained 20 questions which Yashin had invited Kadyrov to answer but was refused. Kadyrov dismissed the report calling it \"nothing but idle chatter\" and posted it on his social network accounts before its release. His spokesman filed a request with the Russian Prosecutor General and the Investigative Committee for Yashin to be arrested for the report saying it contained slander and insults against Kadyrov.\n\nA conference of Islamic scholars funded by the Tabah foundation in the United Arab Emirates, was convened by Kadyrov in Grozny in late August 2016. The conference was attended by notable Islamic scholars including the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed el-Tayeb; Grand Mufti of Egypt, Shawki Allam; ex-Grand Mufti of Egypt Ali Gomaa, Usama al-Azhari who is the religious adviser to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi; Habib Ali al-Jifri and the mufti of Damascus Abdul Fattah al-Bizm. The conference was convened to discuss the alleged abuse of Islamic ideas to propagate extremism and to establish the criteria for determining who are the true followers of the Sunnah. The assembly of scholars issued a fatwa which declared that those who abide by the Kalam, belong to the four madhhabs and follow the path of moral self-perfection espoused by distinguished Islamic teachers, primarily the Sufi sheikhs, were the only true believers. The fatwa called the sect of Salafism as a \"dangerous and erroneous contemporary sect\", along with the extremist groups like Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Hizb ut-Tahrir and Habashis. The conference also issued two further documents. In the first one, it appealed to President Vladimir Putin to ban Salafism and term any condemnation of \"traditional Islam\" as \"extremism\". It also proposed the fatwa be regarded as the considered opinion of \"leading Russian experts\" when evaluating the activity of Muslim organizations and the preaching of individual clerics. The second one issued a resolution calling for the establishment of a Council for Islamic Education and also a Council of Ulema, which would rule on who is and is not a true follower of Sunni Islam.\n\nThe ruling created a controversy, with both Islamic theologians and secular commentators condemning it, with some seeing it as a bid by Kadyrov to divide Russian Muslims into those who accept the importance he places on teachings of the Sufi brotherhoods as well as probably also what he considers as \"traditional Islam\" without question, and those who don't with \"erroneous\" views. Many of the key participants also disavowed the resolutions. Mukkadas Bibarsov, mufti of Saratov Oblast stated that the question of who was a true follower of Sunni Islam was resolved \"centuries ago\". He also added that the fatwa failed to take into account the crucial differences between Russia's Muslims, specifically that some Muslim communities did not follow Sufism. Liz Fuller writing for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty commented that the fatwa seemed to be giving permission to Kadyrov to take any action he likes to punish those whose religious views don't match with his own. Yaroslav Trofimov writing for \"The Wall Street Journal\" described it as a \"new fracture emerging within Islam\". Many Saudi clerics and citizens expressed outrage at the fatwa on social media. The Muslim Brotherhood expressed \"deep sorrow\" over the fatwa, stating that it “ignited fires of discord among Muslims around the world.”\n\nIn 2015, Kadyrov ordered Chechen security forces to “shoot to kill” if they encountered police officers from other parts of Russia on the territory of the Chechen Republic. Kadyrov said: \"I would like to officially state: Open fire if someone from Moscow or Stavropol — it doesn't matter where from — appears on your turf without your knowledge. We have to be reckoned with. … If you are masters of your territory, then you must control it.\" According to Ekaterina Sokirianskaia, \"Some critics claim that Mr. Putin now fears Mr. Kadyrov because he knows any serious attempt to challenge the Chechen leader’s position might lead to a third war.\"\n\nA mixed martial arts tournament involving children was held as an \"exhibition fight\" on 4 October during the \"Grand Prix Akhmat 2016\" in Grozny and broadcast on Match TV. Ramzan's three sons, all of whom are aged under 12, fought in the tournament with Ramzan sitting in the audience and none of the fighters wore any protective gear. One of the fights ended with a technical knockout. He also posted images of the bouts on his Instagram account. The event caused an outcry especially against Ramzan allowing his children to compete in the tournament. Fedor Emelianenko, the president of Russian MMA Union, criticised the event as \"inexcusable\", stating that rules stipulate fighters under the age of 21 have to wear protective gear while children under the age of 12 are not allowed to compete. Vadim Finkelstein, the head of MMA promotion M-1 Global also backed Fedor's comments. Dmitry Peskov, the spokesperson for President Putin, stated that the fact that one of the fights between the children finished with a technical knockout was “a reason for the appropriate oversight agencies to inquire about this incident.” Deputy Minister of Sports Pavel Kolobkov stated that participation of children under the age of 12 in MMA competitions was illegal while stating that the incident was being investigated. Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also stated that the event will be investigated. MMA fighter Jeff Monson however backed the organisers stating that there was nothing wrong with it.\n\nSeveral Chechen officials responded to Fedor's criticism with insults and accusations including Timur Dugazayev, general director of Akhmat MMA promotion, Member of Parliament Adam Delimkhanov as well as Kadyrov himself. The Ministry of Sports found on 18 October that Kadyrov's promotion had violated regulations. It also found that the event was actually an unlicensed show with no regulatory oversight. The promotion was directed to coordinate with the Ministry of Sports and other regulatory bodies to “prevent such irregularities in conduct” and handed a letter detailing its failure to comply with the legislation.\n\nIn an interview with HBO's \"Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel\" in July 2018, Kadyrov denied his government detained and tortured gay men, while stating they weren't human and didn't exist in Chechnya. He further stated that if they existed, they should be sent to Canada. Kadyrov also commented about Russia's nuclear arsenal and tensions between USA and Russia. He stated, \"America is not really a strong enough state for us to regard it as an enemy of Russia, we have a strong government and are a nuclear state.\" He also stated, \"Even if our government was completely destroyed, our nuclear missiles would be automatically deployed. We will put the whole world on its knees and screw it from behind.\"\n\nKadyrov has previously encouraged extrajudicial killings of homosexual men by family members as an alternative to law enforcement. Since February 2017, over 100 male residents of the Chechen Republic (part of the Russian Federation) assumed to be gay or bisexual have been rounded up, detained and tortured by Kadyrov's government on account of their sexual orientation. These crackdowns have been described as part of a systemic anti-LGBT purge in the region. The men have been held and allegedly tortured in what human rights groups and eyewitnesses have called concentration camps. Kadyrov has denied these reports, while also characterizing gay people as \"not human\" and claiming that they \"don't exist in his region\".\n\n\"The New Yorker\" says that over the years Kadyrov has tried out various personalities: \"the merciless warrior in fatigues who leads special operations to kill anti-government rebels; the jolly Caucasus baron who spars with Mike Tyson and shows off his private zoo; the family man and observant Muslim who has banned alcohol, ordered that women wear head scarves in public buildings, and boasts that his six-year-old son has memorized the Koran.\" He enjoys boxing and once met with former heavyweight-boxing champion Mike Tyson.\n\nIn 1996, Kadyrov married Medni Musaevna Kadyrova. The couple are parents of twelve children. His sons Adam and Eli have earned the title of \"hafiz\" while his daughters Aishat, Khadizhat and Khutmat have earned the title of \"hafiza\". Khutmat and another daughter Ashura have performed together with the nasheed singer Mishary Rashid Alafasy. Khadizhat was recognised as the most gifted student in Chechnya in 2016 and qualified for participation in pan-Russian contest \"Student of the Year 2016\" on 20 February 2016. Medni launched her fashion line called \"Firdaws\" in March 2012 in Dubai. Aishat too presented her own fashion collection in March 2017 and has also taken over her mother's fashion enterprise Firdaws.\n\nKadyrov is a noted collector of sports cars. He owns a Lamborghini Reventón, one of only 20 made. He is also known for his extensive collection of Chechen daggers. On 5 October 2011, he celebrated his 35th birthday in a lavish fashion in the presence of several Hollywood stars, including actor Jean-Claude Van Damme and actress Hilary Swank as well as British violinist Vanessa-Mae, singer Seal and many others. When asked where the money for the live-televised celebration were coming from, he reportedly laughed and said \"Allah gives it to us\", before adding: \"I don't know, it comes from somewhere\".\n\n\n"}

In the pre-1930 Soviet census, the Svans were afforded their own \"ethnic group\" (\"natsional'nost\") category. The self-designation of the Svan is Mushüan, which is probably reflected in the ethnonym Misimian of the Classical authors.\n\nThe Svans are usually identified with the Sanni mentioned by Greek geographer Strabo, who placed them more or less in the area still occupied by the modern-day Svans.\n\nIn the Russian Empire and early Soviet Union Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian in the 1930s. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th–6th centuries. However, some remnants of pre-Christian beliefs have been maintained. Saint George (known as \"Jgëræg\" to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including blood revenge, although this tradition has been declining over time and as law enforcement takes hold.

Stilwell served as a judge on the CBS show \"Greatest American Dog\" and presented the Animal Planet dog training TV show \"It's Me or the Dog\", counselling families with problem pets and solving their dogs' behaviour problems.\n\nStilwell originally trained as an actress, playing roles in \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" in 1992, ITV1's \"The Bill\" in 1994, and onstage in London's West End theatre, as well as several commercials and voiceovers. She received a BA honours degree in Theatre from Middlesex University. In order to supplement her income as an actress, Stilwell's veterinary nurse sister suggested that she start a dog walking agency. Within a month she was walking 20 dogs per day – 10 in the morning, 10 in the afternoon – and immediately recognised the need for qualified professionals to help her clients with the training process. She then expanded her focus to dog training and after moving to the United States with her husband in 1999, Stilwell co-founded several dog training companies up and down the East Coast.\n\nStilwell has become an advocate of science-based dog training. Stilwell rejects dominance-based, traditional training techniques, instead, promoting positive reinforcement techniques.\n\nIn 2010, Stilwell created Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training – a global network of positive reinforcement dog trainers dedicated to spreading the word about positive reinforcement techniques and behaviourists.\n\nStilwell is currently certified by the Animal Behaviour and Training Associates, and is a longtime member of the US Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT).\n\nStilwell created the Victoria Stilwell Foundation, whose mission is \"to provide financial support and canine behaviour expertise to assistance dog organisations and small animal rescue shelters while promoting the concept of reward-based, positive reinforcement dog training philosophies in organisations and households throughout the United States.\"\n\nWith a particular fondness for rescue animals in need of behavior rehabilitation, Stilwell devotes much of her time and energy to a number of animal rescue organizations around the world, serving as a behavior adviser for shelters in Atlanta, New York, the UK and Hong Kong while giving regular seminars on the subject of dog rescue, training and rehabilitation. She has been involved in animal welfare and protection organizations on a national (U.S.) stage, including serving as an Advisory Board Member of RedRover and a National Ambassador for American Humane. She worked as a volunteer adoption counselor for the ASPCA.\n\nShe has been featured in numerous magazines and journals including \"The New York Times\", \"USA Today\", \"Cosmopolitan\", the \"Daily Mail\", MSNBC.com, \"Psychology Today\" and \"The Sun\". Stilwell is a regular columnist for \"The Bark\", \"Dog World\", \"American Dog\" and \"Dogs Today\" magazines, and she has appeared on numerous talk shows, news broadcasts and radio shows in the US, Europe and Asia as a dog training expert.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Stilwell worked with unruly dogs on her TV show, \"It's Me or the Dog\", which aired in over forty countries. The show features Stilwell as she counsels families with problem pets and uses positive reinforcement training techniques to help them learn how to correct their dogs' behaviour. Originally produced for Channel 4 in the UK, the show premiered in the US on Animal Planet in April 2007, and over 90 episodes have been aired worldwide. A typical episode involves a family struggling to cope with their misbehaving dog(s). Stilwell initially observes the problems in situ, then presents the family with her opinion regarding the causes of the issues. She then works with the family and their dogs to restore balance.\n\nStilwell was one of three judges on the CBS show \"Greatest American Dog\", in which 12 dog-owner teams compete for the title 'Greatest American Dog' and a $250,000 prize. The series debuted on CBS 10 July 2008.\n\nStilwell created a podcast called \"Victoria Stilwell Positively\", available on iTunes and other places of podcast purchase\n\nStilwell was honoured with the prestigious \"Excellence in Journalism and Outstanding Contributions to the Pet Industry Award\" at the 2011 Global Pet Expo and was named 'Dog Trainer of the Year' by DogWorld Magazine at the 55th Annual Purina Pro Plan Show Dogs of the Year Awards Presented By Dogs in Review. She was named among 2009's '100 Best & Brightest' in the dog world in \"The Bark\" magazine. Stilwell won a 2009 CableFax award as Best Host in the Animals & Nature category. In 2009, \"It's Me or the Dog\" was nominated for a People's Choice Award in the US, and after its first season in the UK, \"It's Me or the Dog\" was nominated in the 'Best Factual Entertainment' category in the UK's TV Quick Awards. Her first book, \"It's Me or the Dog: How to Have the Perfect Pet\" was voted one of the 50 greatest dog books ever written by \"Dogs Today\" magazine.\n\nShe advocates animal rescue and supports \"Paws Atlanta\", \"Atlanta Pet Rescue\", \"Stray from the Heart (NYC)\", \"Hong Kong Dog Rescue\" and \"Greyhound Rescue West of England (www.grwe.com)\", \"Wisconsin Puppy Mill Project\", the \"Waterside Action Group\", \"Deed Not Breed\" (campaigning to re-write the UK's Dangerous Dogs Act to remove breed-specific legislation) as well as \"Vets Get Scanning\", promoting mandatory pet micro-chipping and scanning by vets.\n\nStilwell is a critic of fox hunting and was among more than 20 high-profile people who signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 to oppose Conservative prime minister David Cameron's plan to amend the Hunting Act 2004.\n\nStilwell met her actor husband, Van Zeiler, while starring opposite him in the West End production of \"Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story\". The couple and their daughter live in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nAfter many years without a pet dog of her own (due to work commitments), Stilwell adopted a rescued chocolate Labrador named Sadie. In early 2011, Stilwell fostered a Chihuahua/Miniature Pinscher mix named Jasmine and decided to adopt her in late February/early March 2011. Prior to that, she had spent her time since 2000 fostering dogs due to be euthanised by local municipal shelters. Stilwell and her husband then gave the dogs a home while rehabilitating them and eventually finding suitable homes for the animals. She has explained that, until recently, owning a dog would have been irresponsible and not fair to the dog, considering how much the whole family travels. The couple has re-homed over 50 dogs and cats.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1144155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1144155", "title": "Vince Coleman (train dispatcher)", "text": "Vince Coleman (train dispatcher)\n\nPatrick Vincent Coleman (13March 18726December 1917) was a train dispatcher for the Canadian Government Railways (formerly the ICR, Intercolonial Railway of Canada) who was killed in the Halifax Explosion, but not before he sent a message to an incoming passenger train to stop out of range of the explosion. Today he is remembered as one of the heroic figures from the disaster.\n\nOn the morning of 6 December 1917, the 45-year-old Coleman and Chief Clerk William Lovett were working in the Richmond station, surrounded by the railway yards near the foot of Richmond Street, only a few hundred feet from Pier 6. From there, trains were controlled on the main line into Halifax. The line ran along the western shore of Bedford Basin from Rockingham Station to the city's passenger terminal at the North Street Station, located a mile to the south of Richmond Station. Coleman was an experienced dispatcher who had been commended a few years earlier for helping to safely stop a runaway train.\n\nAt approximately 8:45 a.m., there was a collision between , a French munitions ship carrying a cargo of high explosives, and a Norwegian vessel, . Immediately thereafter \"Mont-Blanc\" caught fire, and the crew abandoned ship. The vessel drifted from near the mid-channel over to Pier 6 on the slack tide in a matter of minutes and beached herself. A sailor, believed to have been sent ashore by a naval officer, warned Coleman and Lovett of her cargo of high explosives. The overnight express train No. 10 from Saint John, New Brunswick, carrying nearly 300 passengers, was due to arrive at 8:55 a.m. Before leaving the office, Lovett called CGR terminal agent Henry Dustan to warn him of a burning ship laden with explosives that was heading for the pier. After sending Lovett's message, Coleman and Lovett were said to have left the CGR depot. However, the dispatcher returned to the telegraph office and continued sending warning messages along the rail line as far as Truro to stop trains inbound for Halifax. An accepted version of Coleman's Morse code message reads as follows:\n\n\"Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbour making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys.\"\n\nThe telegraphed warnings were apparently heeded, as the No. 10 passenger train was stopped just before the explosion occurred. The train was halted at Rockingham Station, on the western shore of Bedford Basin, approximately from the downtown terminal. After the explosion, Coleman's message, followed by other messages later sent by railway officials who made their way to Rockingham, passed word of the disaster to the rest of Canada. The railway quickly mobilized aid, sending a dozen relief trains with fire and medical help from towns in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the day of the disaster, followed two days later by help from other parts of Canada and from the United States, most notably Boston. Even though Lovett had left the station, both he and Coleman were killed in the explosion.\n\nAlthough historians debate whether Coleman's initial message actually contributed to stopping the No. 10 train, there is some documented evidence to indicate it did. No. 10's Conductor Gillespie reported to the \"Moncton Transcript\" that although running on time, \"his train was held for fifteen minutes by the dispatcher at Rockingham.\"\n\nVince Coleman was also the subject of a Heritage Minute and was a prominent character in the CBC miniseries \"\". The Heritage Minute and other sources contain historical inaccuracies in that Coleman is shown warning others in the area surrounding the depot station of the impending explosion. In reality the Richmond Station was surrounded by freight yards. Another error is the exaggeration of the number of passengers aboard the Saint John train. The four-car overnight passenger train contained a maximum of 300 people, not 700 as claimed in the Heritage Minute. The warning message is also changed. Coleman's telegraph key, watch and pen are on display in the Halifax Explosion exhibit at Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.\n\nColeman is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Halifax, at the intersection of Mumford Road with Joseph Howe Drive. He was survived by his wife Frances, who lived until 1970. A street is named after him in the Clayton Park neighbourhood of Halifax, and in 2007 a section of Albert Street near his old home was renamed Vincent Street. A condominium near Mount Olivet Cemetery on Bayer's Road is named The Vincent Coleman, also in his honour.\n\nColeman was inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2004. A Halifax harbour ferry was named \"Vincent Coleman\", by popular vote in the spring of 2017. The ferry was dedicated and officially entered service in a ceremony at the Halifax ferry terminal on March 14, 2018\n\n\n"}
