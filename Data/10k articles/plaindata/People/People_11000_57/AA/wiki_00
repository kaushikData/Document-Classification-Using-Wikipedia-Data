Fifteen people died. The sinking of the \"Ilinden\" was the deadliest boat accident in the history of the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nLake Ohrid is the deepest lake in the Balkans, with maximum depth of . The \"Ilinden\" boat was taking tourists to the Saint Naum Monastery. The boat, built in 1924, had a maximum capacity of 45 passengers. It sank within four minutes, some from the shore, in shallow waters. The boat is said to have sunk around 11:00 AM local time, in the vicinity of the Elešec camping site. Two other boats, the \"Alexandria\" and the \"Kristina\", were nearby and were able to assist the passengers of the \"Ilinden\". Most of the tourists on board were senior citizens, many of whom were unable to swim. Victims were from Pirdop, Zlatitsa, Chelopech and particularly Anton.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia's top officials visited the place of the accident. Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borisov ordered that a Bulgarian government aeroplane bring the surviving Bulgarians back home. Another aeroplane, a Bulgarian Air Force C-27J Spartan, transported the corpses of Bulgarian victims. The Minister of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of Macedonia Mile Janakievski offered his resignation over the accident due to moral reasons, which was not accepted by Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.\n\n6 September was declared a national day of mourning in the Republic of Macedonia. Similarly, 7 September was declared a national day of mourning in Bulgaria and all official events related to the celebration of the Bulgarian unification on 6 September were cancelled. A minute of silence was observed before Macedonia and Bulgaria's 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers later on 5 September and against Scotland and Montenegro.\n\nA nongovernmental organization, the Bulgarian Cultural Club – Skopje proposed to Mayor Aleksandar Petreski of Ohrid the erection of a monument commemorating both the victims of the accident and those whose help saved many lives.\n"}

The plot, carried out in 1762, was successful, and Peter was imprisoned under Alexei Orlov's guard. He died shortly afterwards in mysterious circumstances, and it was popularly believed Orlov had either ordered, or personally carried out, his murder. Handsomely rewarded by Catherine after her accession, the Orlovs became powerful at court. Alexei was promoted and took part in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–74, commanding a naval expedition to the Mediterranean in 1770, which destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Chesma. For his success he was granted the honorific Chesmensky. The Russian victory sparked off the Orlov Revolt in the Greek territories of the Ottoman Empire soon afterwards.\n\nOrlov remained in the Mediterranean, and received the unusual commission of seducing and then capturing Princess Tarakanoff, a pretender to the Russian throne. Orlov was successful in doing so, and tricked her into boarding a Russian ship at Livorno, where she was arrested and transported to Russia. Alexei's brother, Grigory, Catherine's lover before and after the coup took place, fell from favour soon afterwards, and the Orlovs' power at court diminished. Alexei became a renowned breeder of livestock at his estates, developing the horse breed known as the Orlov Trotter and popularising the Orloff breed of chicken. He left Russia after the death of Catherine and the accession of her son, Tsar Paul I, but returned after Paul's death and lived in Russia until his death in 1808.\n\nAlexei was born into the noble Orlov family in Lyubini in Tver Oblast on , the son of Grigory Ivanovich Orlov, governor of Novgorod, and brother of Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov. He entered the Preobrazhensky Regiment and by 1762 had reached the rank of sergeant. He distinguished himself in the Seven Years' War and was wounded at the Battle of Zorndorf. He was described as a giant of a man, over two meters tall, and a celebrated duellist, with a scar across his cheek. The scar earned him the nickname 'scarface'.\n\nTogether with his brother Grigory, Alexei Orlov became involved in the palace coup to overthrow Tsar Peter III and place his wife, Catherine, on the Russian throne. In the coup, carried out in July 1762, Alexei went to meet Catherine at the Peterhof Palace, and finding her in bed, announced 'the time has come for you to reign, madame.' He then drove her to St Petersburg, where the guards regiments there proclaimed their loyalty to her. The Tsar was arrested and imprisoned at Ropsha, under the guard of Alexei Orlov. There Peter died in mysterious circumstances on . Orlov is popularly supposed to have murdered him, either on his own initiative or on Catherine's orders. One account has Orlov giving him poisoned wine to drink which caused ... flames [to course] through his veins. This aroused suspicion in the overthrown emperor and he refused the next glass. But they used force, and he defended himself. In that horrible struggle, in order to stifle his cries, they threw him on the ground and grabbed his throat. But he defended himself with the strength that comes from final desperation, and they tried to avoid wounding him. They placed a rifle strap on the emperor's neck. Alexei Orlov kneeled with both legs on his chest and blocked his breathing. He passed away in their hands. Orlov apparently wrote a letter to Catherine after Peter's death, confessing that Peter had been killed in a drunken brawl with one of his jailers, Feodor Bariatynsky, and taking the blame. The authenticity of this letter has been questioned. It was announced that the Tsar had died from an attack of haemorrhoidal colic.\n\nThe Orlovs were rewarded after Catherine's accession, and Alexei was promoted to the rank of major-general, and given the title of count. He and his brother received 50,000 roubles and 800 serfs. Despite a lack of formal education and his ignorance of foreign languages, he maintained an interest in science, patronizing Mikhail Lomonosov and Denis Fonvizin, and corresponding with Jean Jacques Rousseau. He was one of the founders of the Free Economic Society and its first elected chairman. Rewarded with large estates, he took an interest in horse breeding, developing the Orlov Trotter, and popularising the breed of chicken now known as the Orloff.\n\nHe became involved in military operations during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768-74, organising the First Archipelago Expedition, and commanding of a squadron of the Imperial Russian Navy. He fought and won the Battle of Chesma against an Ottoman fleet on 5 July 1770, with the help of British naval expertise, and received the right to add the honorific 'Chesmensky' to his name. He was also awarded the Order of St. George First Class. His expedition sparked off the Orlov Revolt in Greece, which despite initial successes, lacked continued Russian support, and was eventually put down by the Ottomans. Orlov was sent as plenipotentiary to the talks at Focşani in 1772, but his impatience caused the breaking off of negotiations, which led to dissatisfaction from the Empress.\n\nCatherine then commissioned Orlov to make contact with Yelizaveta Alekseyevna, a pretender to the throne claiming to be the daughter of Empress Elizabeth of Russia, and deliver her to Russia. Orlov did so by pretending to be a supporter of hers, and successfully seduced her. He then lured her aboard a Russian ship at Livorno in May 1775, where she was arrested by Admiral Samuel Greig and taken to Russia, where she was imprisoned and later died. Shortly after this service, the Orlovs fell from favour at court, and Alexei and Grigory were dismissed from their positions. Orlov retired to the near Moscow, and gave luxurious balls and dinners, making himself 'the most popular man in Moscow.'\n\nAfter Catherine's death in 1796 the new ruler, Tsar Paul I ordered that his father, Peter III, be reburied in a grand ceremony. Alexei Orlov was ordered to carry the Imperial Crown in front of the coffin. Orlov was briefly suspected of having been one of the assassins of Paul I. Orlov left Russia during the reign of Paul I, but returned to Moscow after his death and the accession of Tsar Alexander I. Orlov commanded the militia of the fifth district during the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806-7, which was placed on a war footing almost entirely at his own expense.\n\nHe died in Moscow on . He left an estate worth five million roubles and 30,000 serfs. His marriage with Eudokia Nikolayevna Lopukhina (contracted on 6 May 1782) produced a daughter, Anna Orlova-Tshesmenskaja (1785–1848), and a son, Ivan (1786–1787). Eudokia died while giving birth to Ivan in 1786. Orlov also is believed to have had an illegitimate son named Alexander (1763–1820).\n\n"}

He was conscripted into the British Army in 1939, at the age of 19, and served with the Gordon Highlanders stationed at Fort Canning in Singapore. He was taken prisoner when the Japanese invaded the island during the Battle of Singapore, which lasted from December 1941 to February 1942. He was sent to work on the Burma Railway, built by the Empire of Japan to support its forces in the Burma Campaign and referred to as \"Death Railway\" because of the tens of thousands of forced labourers who died during its construction. While working on the railway Urquhart suffered malnutrition, cholera and torture at the hands of his captors.\n\nAfter working on the railway and in the docks in Singapore, Urquhart was loaded into the hold of the \"Kachidoki Maru\", an American passenger and cargo ship captured by the Japanese and put to use as a \"hell ship\" transporting hundreds of prisoners. The ship was part of a convoy bound for Japan; on the voyage prisoners endured more illness, dehydration, and instances of cannibalism. On 12 September 1944, the ship was torpedoed and sunk by the US submarine USS \"Pampanito\", whose commander was unaware of its cargo of prisoners. Urquhart was burned and covered in oil when the ship went down, and swallowed some oil which caused permanent damage to his vocal cords. He floated in a single-man raft for five days without food or water before being picked up by a Japanese whaling ship and taken to Japan.\n\nIn Japan, Urquhart was sent to work in coal mines belonging to the Aso Mining Company and later a labour camp ten miles from the city of Nagasaki. He was there when the city was hit with an atomic bomb by the United States.\n\nIn 2010, Urquhart published \"The Forgotten Highlander: My Incredible Story of Survival During the War in the Far East\", an account of his experiences. In the book he expresses anger at the lack of recognition in Japan of its role in war crimes compared to the atonement in Germany.

{"id": "228111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=228111", "title": "Antonio José de Sucre", "text": "Antonio José de Sucre\n\nAntonio José de Sucre y Alcalá (; 1795–1830), known as the \"Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho\" (), was a Venezuelan independence leader who served as the fourth President of Peru and the second President of Bolivia. Sucre was one of Simón Bolívar's closest friends, generals and statesmen. The city of Sucre, Bolivia's capital, is named for him, as is a state of Venezuela and a department of Colombia. Both the old and new airports of Ecuador's capital Quito are also named after him.\n\nThe aristocratic Sucre family traces its roots back to origins in Flanders. It arrived in Venezuela through Charles de Sucre y Franco Perez, a Flemish nobleman, son of Charles Adrian de Sucre, Marquess of Peru and Buenaventura Carolina Isabel Garrido y Pardo, a Spanish noblewoman. Charles de Sucre y Pardo served as a soldier in Catalonia in 1698 and was later named Governor of Cartagena de Indias and Captain General of Cuba. On December 22, 1779, Charles de Sucre y Pardo arrived in Cumaná, Venezuela, having been named Governor of New Andalucia, which includes present-day Sucre State.\n\nIn 1814, Antonio José de Sucre joined the fight for South America independence from Spain. The Battle of Pichincha took place on May 24, 1822, on the slopes of the Pichincha volcano, near Quito in what is now Ecuador. The encounter, fought in the context of the Spanish American wars of independence, pitted a Patriot army under Sucre against a Royalist army commanded by Field Marshal Melchor Aymerich. The defeat of the Royalist forces brought about the liberation of Quito and secured the independence of the provinces belonging to the \"Real Audiencia de Quito\", or \"Presidencia de Quito\", the Spanish colonial administrative jurisdiction from which the Republic of Ecuador would eventually emerge.\n\nAs of late 1824, Royalists still had control of most of southern Peru as well as Real Felipe Fort in the port of Callao. On December 9, 1824, the Battle of Ayacucho took place at Pampa de La Quinua, near the town of Quinua, between Royalist and Patriot forces. Sucre, as Simón Bolívar's lieutenant, led the Patriot forces to victory over the Viceroy José de la Serna, who was wounded. After the battle, second commander-in-chief José de Canterac signed the final capitulation of the Royalist army on his behalf. As a result, he was promoted, at the request of the Peruvian Congress, to Marshal and as General in Chief by the Colombian legislature.\nAfter the victory at Ayacucho, following precise orders from Bolívar, Sucre, nominated as Ayacucho's Grand Marshal, entered Upper Peru (known today as Bolivia) territory on February 25, 1825. Besides having orders of installing an immediately independent administration, his role was limited to giving an appearance of legality to the process that Upper Peruvians themselves had begun already. \n\nRoyalist general Pedro Antonio Olañeta stayed in Potosí, where he received by January the \"Union\" Infantry Battalion coming from Puno under the command of colonel José María Valdez. Olañeta then summoned a War Council, which agreed to continue the resistance in the name of Ferdinand VII. Next, Olañeta distributed his troops between Cotagaita fortress with the \"Chichas\" Battalion. in charge of colonel Medinacelli, while Valdez was sent to Chuquisaca with the \"Union\" Infantry Battalion and loyalist militias, and Olañeta himself marched toward Vitichi, with 60,000 pieces of gold from the Coin House in Potosí. But for the Spanish military personnel in Upper Peru, it was too little too late, as since 1821 all out guerilla warfare had raged in this part of the continent.\n\nHowever, in Cochabamba the First Battalion of the Infantry Regiment \"Ferdinand VII\", led by colonel José Martínez, rebelled and side with the independence movement, only to be followed later by the Second Battalion, \"Ferdinand VII\" Infantry Regiment in Vallegrande, resulting in the forced resignation of Brigadier Francisco Aguilera on February 12. Royalist colonel José Manuel Mercado occupied Santa Cruz de la Sierra on February 14, as Chayanta stayed in the hands of lieutenant colonel Pedro Arraya, with the cavalry squadrons \"Santa Victoria\" (Holy Victory) and \"Dragones Americanos\" (American Dragoons), and in Chuquisaca the cavalry squadron \"Dragones de la Frontera\"(Frontier Dragoons) under colonel Francisco López claimed victory for the independence forces on February 22. At this point, the majority of royalist troops of Upper Peru refused to continue fighting against the powerful army of Sucre and switched allegiances. Colonel Medinacelli with 300 soldiers also revolted against Olañeta, and on April 2 of 1825 they faced each other in the Battle of Tumusla, which ended with the death of Olañeta. A few days later, on April 7, general José Mario Valdez surrendered in Chequelte to general Urdininea, putting an end to the war in Upper Peru and signalling victory to the local independence movement which had been active since 1811.\n\nAfter the Constituent Assembly in Chuquisaca was reconvened by Marshal Sucre, on July 8 of 1825, and then later concluded, it was determined the complete independence of Upper Peru under the republican form. Finally, the Assembly president José Mariano Serrano, together with a commission, wrote down the \"Independence Act of the Upper Peruvian Departments\" which carries the date of August 6, 1825, in honor of the Battle of Junín won by Bolivar. Independence was declared by 7 representatives from Charcas, 14 from Potosí, 12 from La Paz, 13 from Cochabamba and 2 from Santa Cruz. The act of Independence, wrote by the president of the Congress, Serrano, states in its expositive part:\n\nThrough a decree it was determined that the new state in Upper Peru would carry the name of República Bolívar, in honor of the liberator, who was designated as \"Father of the Republic and Supreme Chief of State\". Bolívar thanked them for these honors, but declined the presidency of the Republic, a duty he gave instead to the victor of Ayacucho, Grand Marshal Sucre, who would later be sworn in the same day as the first President of Bolivia. After some time, the subject of the name of the Young nation arose again, and a Potosian deputy named Manuel Martín Cruz offered a solution, suggesting that in the same manner which from Romulus comes Rome, from Bolívar ought to come the new nation of Bolivia.\n\nBy the time Bolívar got the news of the decision, he felt flattered by the young nation, but until then he hadn’t accepted willingly Upper Peru's because he was worried about its future, due to Bolivia's location in the center of South America; this, according to Bolivar, would create a nation that would face many future wars, which curiously did happen. Bolivar wished that Bolivia would become part of another nation, preferably Peru (given the fact that it had been part of Viceroyalty del Perú for centuries), or Argentina (since during the last decades of colonial domain it had been part of Viceroyalty del Río de la Plata), but what deeply convinced him otherwise was the attitude of the people. On August 18, upon his arrival to La Paz, there was a manifestation of popular rejoicing. The same scene repeated when the Liberator arrived to Oruro, then to Potosí and finally to Chuquisaca. Such a fervent demonstration by the people touched Bolívar, who called the new nation his \"Predilect Daughter\", and was called by the peoples of the new republic their \"Favorite Son\".\n\nAfter the foundation of Bolivia, he became also the commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Bolivia, which he created the following day on the basis of the guerrilla forces and active Patriot armies stationed at the time of the declaration. He gave the young republic its first Constitution in 1828.\n\nIn the Battle of Tarqui, fought on February 27, 1829, heavily outnumbered two to one, Sucre defeated a Peruvian invasion force led by third President and General of Peru José de La Mar, whose intentions had been to annex Guayaquil and the rest of Ecuador to Peru.\n\nWhen a strong movement arose against Bolívar, his followers, and the Bolivian constitution in 1828, Sucre resigned.\n\nSucre was killed on June 4, 1830. General Juan José Flores wanted to separate the southern departments (Quito, Guayaquil, and Azuay), called the District of Ecuador, from the Gran Colombia so as to form an independent country and become its first President. General Flores foresaw that if Antonio José de Sucre arrived in Quito from Bogota, he could thwart his plans, since Sucre was very popular due to his reputation as hero and leader in the Battles of Pichincha, Tarqui and Ayacucho. General Juan José Flores put himself in contact with the anti-Bolívar and anti-Sucre leader Brigadier-General and the Commanding General of Cauca, José María Obando, who was not present at Sucre's death but who delegated this criminal act to the Venezuelan Colonel Apolinar Morillo. Commander Juan Gregorio Sarria (who later confessed he had been paid by Obando), José Erazo (a highway bandit and guerrilla fighter), and three peons as accomplices. The plan was to ambush José Antonio de Sucre on the morning of June 4, 1830, in the cold and bleak forested district of Berruecos, along a narrow path that was perennially covered with fog. \n\nThe five assassins were hiding behind trees along the part of the trail known as La Jacoba waiting for Sucre's party, which would be passing the area single file. Sucre's retinue comprised seven persons: two muleteers with the baggage, two sergeants, one being the Marshal's orderly, a representative to the Congress from Cuenca, and his servant, and finally Sucre himself. When Sucre approached La Jacoba, he was struck by three bullets, two inflicting superficial wounds to his head and one piercing his heart. He fell from his horse, which had been shot in the neck, and died almost instantly. His body remained there for twenty-four hours, as his companions, fearful of a similar fate, had fled in panic. \n\nLater, Juan Gregorio Sarria and Colonel Apolinar Morillo confessed that it was Obando who had convinced them to assassinate Sucre. Commander Juan Gregorio Sarria also confessed that Obando had paid him to kill Sucre, since there were anti-Bolivar politicians and officers in Bogota that wanted to see both Bolívar and Sucre eliminated. The ringleader of the anti-Bolívar faction in Bogota was Santander, who was Obando's friend and who had failed in his attempt to assassinate Bolivar . The three peons who were part of the Sucre assassination party were poisoned by Apolinar Morillo to prevent them from testifying about Sucre's murder. In the end, Colonel Apolinar Morillo was convicted and shot in the main square of Bogota for the murder of Sucre on November 30, 1842, and José Erazo died in prison that same year. José Maria Obando was granted immunity due to the fact that he was too powerful in the Cauca Department. Francisco de Paula Santander, although indirectly involved with Sucre's death, was directly involved with Bolívar's attempted assassination and was exiled .\n\nThe following day Sucre's orderly, a sergeant named Lorenzo Caicedo, with some help from others, buried the body and marked the makeshift grave with a cross formed of branches. When the widow received news of the assassination, she promptly brought Sucre's remains from Berruecos to Quito, where they were interred in secret in the oratory of the chapel of \"El Dean\" on one of her haciendas. Subsequently, she had the remains transferred, also in secret, to the Carmen Bajo Convent in Quito, where they were placed facing the main altar of the church. Seventy years later, in April 1900, Sucre's remains were discovered and, their authenticity scrupulously verified, transferred to the Quito Cathedral on June 4, 1900, in a sumptuous parade led by the Executive and his Ministers, the high dignitaries of the Church, and the diplomatic corps. At the time, the government ordered the building of a crypt, but it was not inaugurated until thirty-two years later, on August 4, 1932. This mausoleum consisted of a nine-ton monolith of granite from the quarries of the Pichincha volcano. Its cover, on which a cross is carved in high relief, was so heavy that thirty persons were required to move it into place.\n\nAccording to the December 19, 1830 \"Gaceta de Colombia\", Issue No. 495, a power-hungry, ambitious General Obando paid an assassin to kill Sucre by falsely informing the assassin that Sucre was a traitor and had to be stopped because Sucre's intentions were to go to Quito and separate the Department of Cauca and the three southern departments of Colombia and unite them with Peru. In reality, Sucre, a protégé of Bolívar, was going to Quito to stop the separation of the District of Ecuador from the Gran Colombia and to retire as soon as possible in Quito to live a quiet life with his wife. Some have argued that Sucre was ordered assassinated by General Obando so as to leave no clear successor to Bolívar in the Gran Colombia. Before his death, Bolívar believed Sucre to be the only man who could have reunited the Gran Colombia; however, Bolívar's generals and the majority of the politicians running the separate departments of the Gran Colombia had other selfish and ambitious plans. Sucre represented, according to historian Tomás Polanco Alcántara, \"the indispensable complement to Simón Bolívar\". Upon hearing the news of Sucre's death, Bolívar said, \"Se ha derramado, Dios excelso, la sangre del inocente Abel...\" (\"The blood of the innocent Abel has been spilled, oh God almighty...\"). Bolívar later wrote (\"Gaceta de Colombia\", July 4, 1830):\n\nSucre is buried in the Cathedral of Quito, Ecuador, as he had said, \"I want my bones to be forever in Quito\", where his wife, Mariana de Carcelén y Larrea, Marquise of Solanda, was from.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Though the city's exact location is not certain, it presently lies in the Munshiganj District of Bangladesh, and continues to be celebrated as an early center of Buddhist cultural, academic, and political life. Similar to Gautama Buddha, Atiśa was born into royalty. His father was a king known as Kalyana Shri and his mother was Shri Prabhavati. One of three royal brothers, Atiśa went by the name of Candragarbha during the first part of his life. In fact, it was not until he traveled to Guge and encountered King Jangchup Ö (, 984–1078) that he was given the name Atiśa.\n\nAtisá's Birthplace is still known as the Homestead of an atheist scholar because as Buddhism is non theistic, people in Bangladesh often refer him as an atheist scholar.\n\nAccording to Tibetan sources, Atiśa was ordained into the Mahāsāṃghika lineage at the age of twenty-eight by the Abbot Śīlarakṣita and studied almost all Buddhist and non-Buddhist schools of his time, including teachings from Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Tantric Hinduism and other practices. He also studied the sixty-four kinds of art, the art of music and the art of logic and accomplished these studies until the age of twenty-two. Among the many Buddhist lineages he studied, practiced and transmitted the three main lineages were the \"Lineage of the Profound Action\" transmitted by Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, the \"Lineage of Profound View\" transmitted by Nagarjuna and Candrakīrti, and the \"Lineage of Profound Experience\" transmitted by Tilopa and Naropa. It is said that Atiśa had more than 150 teachers, but one key one was Dharmakīrtiśrī.\n\nTibetan sources assert that Atisa spent 12 years in Sumatra of the Srivijaya empire and he returned to India in 1025 CE which was also the same year when Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty invaded Sumatra.\nAtiśa returned to India. Once back, the increasingly knowledgeable monk received much attention for his teachings and skills in debate and philosophy. On three separate occasions, the monk Atiśa was acclaimed for defeating non-Buddhist extremists in debate. When he came into contact with what he perceived to be a misled or deteriorating form of Buddhism he would quickly and effectively implement reforms. Soon enough he was appointed to the position of steward, or abbot, at Vikramashila established by Emperor Dharmapala.\n\nAtiśa's return from Suvarnabhumi, where he had been studying with Dharmakīrtiśrī, and his rise to prominence in India coincided with a flourishing of Buddhist culture and the practice of Buddhism in the region, and in many ways Atiśa's influence contributed to these developments. According to traditional narratives, King Langdarma had suppressed Buddhism's teachings and persecuted its followers for over seventy years. According to the \"Blue Annals\", a new king of Guge by the name of Yeshe-Ö sent his academic followers to learn and translate some of the Sanskrit Buddhist texts. Among these academics was Nagtso, who was eventually sent to Vikramashila to study Sanskrit and plead with Atiśa to come teach the Dharma in his homeland.\nAt Ngari, he was very impressed with the king's request for \"a teaching of the people […] had [Atiśa] been asked for advanced empowerments into tantric deity systems […] he would have been far less pleased\". It was during the three years Atiśa spent in this town that he compiled his teachings into his most influential scholarly work, \"Bodhipathapradīpa\", and encountered the disciple forecast by Tārā, Dromtön. It was this disciple who furthered Atiśa's work after he died.\n\nAccording to Jamgon Kongtrul, when Atiśa discovered the store of Sanskrit texts at Pekar Kordzoling, the library of Samye, \"he said that the degree to which the Vajrayana had spread in Tibet was unparalleled, even in India.

He was the major Russian Army reformer and founder of several elite military formations during the reign of Anna of Russia. As a statesman, he is regarded as the founder of Russian Philhellenism. Münnich also was a hereditary engineer and a specialist in hydrotechnology. He had the grade of count of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.\n\nMünnich was born at Neuenhuntorf in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg in the military family of Anton Günther Mönnich (since 1688 \"von Münnich\", an east-Frisian nobility). Beside the knowledge of the native Low German language he also learned the Latin and French languages. He entered the French service at 17. Thence he transferred successively to the armies of Hesse-Darmstadt and of Saxony where he earned the rank of a colonel and later Major General.\n\nIn 1721, he was invited by the Russian ambassador in Warsaw Grigoriy Dolgorukov for engineering projects of the newly acquired northern territories. Around that time his father has died. Upon arrival to Russia he presented Peter I plans for the fortification of Kronstadt fortress, with which pleasantly surprised the Russian emperor, and the Annenkrone fortification in Vyborg. He was promoted to the Lieutenant General in 1722. Among his first undertakings was the completion of the costly Ladoga Canal, which had been under construction for more than a decade. For his engineering and military-engineering achievements he was promoted to the rank of the General-in-Chief in 1726 by Catherine I, and awarded the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky. In 1727, Münnich was appointed the Governor of Saint Petersburg city while the Imperial court was temporarily transferred to Moscow by Peter II. From 1728 to 1734 he was a General-Governor of Ingria, Karelia, and Finland as well as was awarded the title of a count. During his governorship Münnich improved the local ports, reinforced the newly established Peter and Paul Fortress (1703), and was thinking of building a bridge towards Stockholm.\n\nUpon the coronation of Anna of Russia (1730), he was instructed to prepare the city for the return of Imperial court. After successfully accomplishing that Münnich was promoted to a General-Fieldmarshal, was appointed to the position of president of Russian War Collegiate in 1732 as well as given an order to re-organize the Russian army. Münnich became a founder of the Leib-Guard Cavalry Regiment, the Izmaylovsky Regiment, and the Shlyakhetskiy Cadet Corps which was destined to supply the future generations of officers. \n\nMünnich also reformed numerous other military formations as well as the War Collegiate itself. He established a new formation for the Russian army at that time, the Corps which consisted of 12 regiments Cuirassier Cavalry as well as the first Hussar regiments. Münnich revised the table of ranks and evened the salary of the Russian officers with the invited foreign military specialists. He was the first to introduce the sapper regiments to the Russian army as well as founded the Engineer School for Officers. During his administration some 50 other fortresses were erected which substantially improved the well-being of the Russian Armed Forces at that time. Due to the Andrey Osterman affairs, he was released of his duties.\n\nIn 1734, by the reference of Ernst Johann von Biron he was sent to take the city of Danzig (Gdańsk) and after a prolonged siege and evasion of Stanisław Leszczyński was heavily reproached. However, after that in 1733, the Russian Empire was able to install Augustus III of Poland as the King of Poland (ratified in 1736).\n\nIn 1736, as the Commander of the Russian army he headed the Turkish campaigns besieging the important ports of Azak and Özi. \nOn 21 May 1735 he stormed and sacked Or Qapı penetrating into the Crimea peninsula. \nMünnich destroyed the important Tatar cities of Kezlev, Aqmescit, and Bakhchisaray. \nHe was forced out of the peninsula due to poor logistics and battle fatigue of his formations, while another General, Count Peter von Lacy, took Azak earning himself a rank of the General-Fieldmarshal. \nMünnich refused to resume the campaign the very next year, but he returned to the lower Dnieper steppes in 1737, and on 2 July took the fortress of Özi with the help of the Russian artillery. \nDuring the sack of Özi, he manually raised the regimental banner of the Izmailovsky Regiment on one of the towers of fortress after a successful attack. \nThe siege of Özi was also later mentioned in the humorous stories about Baron Munchausen, based on the adventures of the page to Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick, Hieronymus von Münchhausen. \nDue to the heavy losses, the campaign was paused again while conducting negotiations in Nemirov (Podolie) without much result. \nIn 1739, Münnich won the Battle of Stavuchany, took Khotyn two days later, and established himself firmly in Moldavia. \nHis victory in this campaign was later mentioned in one of the Lomonosov's odes, considered to be the first poem of Russian literature. Threatening to burn down the capital of Moldavia, the city of Iași, he forced the Moldavian boyars to sign the annexation of Moldavia. \nAfter the Ottoman war he was awarded the Order of St. Andrew and the Golden Weapon for Courage. \nDue to military losses of the Habsburg monarchy and worsening of the relationship with the Swedish Hats, the Russian Empire had to sign the Treaty of Niš by which it had to return the newly acquired Nogai steppes while keeping the fortress of Azak.\n\nMarshal Münnich now began to take an active part in political affairs, the particular tone of which was given by his rivalry with Biron, duke of Courland.\nMünnich's activity was brought to a close by the revolution of 1741; he was arrested on his way to the border, and condemned to death. Brought out for execution, and withdrawn from the scaffold, he was later sent to Pelym, Siberia, where he remained for several years, until the accession of Peter III brought about his release in 1762. \n\nCatherine II, who soon displaced Peter, employed the old field marshal as director-general of the Baltic ports.\nMünnich died four years later in Tartu and was buried at his estate nearby, where his grave was damaged by the Soviets. The Russian 37th Dragoons Regiment used to bear his name.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "144171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144171", "title": "Christina Aguilera", "text": "Christina Aguilera\n\nChristina María Aguilera (; born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and television personality. Her work has earned her five Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 2009, she ranked at number 58 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, thereby becoming the youngest and the only artist under 30 to be named. \"Billboard\" recognized her as the 20th most successful artist of the 2000s, and in 2013, \"Time\" included Aguilera on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nBorn in Staten Island, New York and raised in Pennsylvania, she appeared on the television series \"Star Search\" and \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" in her early years. After recording \"Reflection\", the theme for Disney's 1998 film \"Mulan\", Aguilera signed with RCA Records. Aguilera has been recognized as a pop icon and earned the title \"Pop Princess\" in her early years.\n\nAguilera earned two number-one albums on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with her self-titled debut album in 1999 and \"Back to Basics\" in 2006. Her albums \"Stripped\" (2002), \"Bionic\" (2010), \"Lotus\" (2012), and \"Liberation\" (2018) all reached the top-ten in the United States. Furthermore, her Spanish-language album \"Mi Reflejo\" and the holiday album \"My Kind of Christmas\" each topped \"Billboard\" component charts in 2000. Several of Aguilera's songs have experienced international success, including \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\", and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" from her self-titled debut, which each topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, \"Dirrty\", \"Beautiful\", and \"Fighter\" from \"Stripped\", \"Ain't No Other Man\" and \"Hurt\" from \"Back to Basics\", and the collaborations \"Lady Marmalade\", \"Moves like Jagger\", \"Feel This Moment\", and \"Say Something\".\n\nBeyond her music career, Aguilera starred in the film \"Burlesque\" (2010) and has been featured as a coach on six seasons of the reality competition television series \"The Voice\" since 2011. Aside from her work in the entertainment industry, Aguilera is involved in charitable activities through her work as a UN ambassador for the World Food Programme.\n\nChristina María Aguilera was born in the Staten Island borough of New York City, on December 18, 1980, to Shelly Loraine Kearns (née Fidler), a musician, and Fausto Xavier Aguilera, a United States Army soldier. Her father is Ecuadorian, while her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry. Her family moved frequently because of her father's military service, and lived in places including New Jersey, Texas, New York, and Japan. Aguilera and her mother alleged that her father was physically and emotionally abusive, claims which he denied; Aguilera used music as a form of escape from her turbulent household. Following her parents' divorce when she was six years old, Aguilera, her younger sister Rachel, and her mother (who later remarried Jim Kearns and gave birth to one more child, Michael 'Mikey' Kearns), moved into her grandmother's home in the Pittsburgh suburb of Rochester, Pennsylvania. After several years of being estranged, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her father in 2012.\n\nGrowing up, Aguilera, known locally as \"the little girl with the big voice\", aspired to be a singer, singing in local talent shows and competitions. She won her first talent show at the age of 8, in which she performed Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\". In 1990, she appeared on \"Star Search\" singing \"A Sunday Kind of Love\", and was eliminated during the semi-final rounds. She later performed the same song during an appearance on Pittsburgh's KDKA-TV's \"Wake Up with Larry Richert\". Throughout her youth in Pittsburgh, Aguilera sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, in addition to the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals. She attended Rochester Area School District in Rochester and Marshall Middle School near Wexford, and briefly attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before being homeschooled due to bullying.\n\nIn 1991, Aguilera auditioned for a position on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\", although she did not meet its age requirements. She joined the television series two years later, where she performed musical numbers and sketch comedy until its cancellation in 1994. Her co-stars included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake. When she was fourteen, Aguilera recorded her first song, the duet \"All I Wanna Do\" with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi. She later sent her cover version of Houston's \"Run to You\" to Walt Disney Pictures in hopes of being selected to record the theme song \"Reflection\" for their animated film \"Mulan\" (1998). \"Reflection\" peaked at number 19 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\nAfter the recording of \"Reflection\", Aguilera attracted attention of RCA Records A&R Ron Fair and was signed with the label quickly afterwards. The label then started presenting Aguilera with tracks to record and laid foundation for her debut album. While initially catering to making Aguilera's debut a \"wonder introduction of a singer\" like Barbra Streisand, RCA was pressurized by contemporary teen pop craze involving Aguilera's peers including Britney Spears, leading to the label rushing the production process and aligning Aguilera to be part of the teen pop trend. They decided the lead single off the album would be \"Genie in a Bottle\", a trendy pop and R&B track released in June 1999. The single was a major commercial success, peaking atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and record charts of 20 other countries. It has sold over 7 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling singles worldwide.\n\nFollowing the success of the single, Aguilera's eponymous debut album was released in August to commercial success, peaking at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It moved 14 million copies worldwide, and produced three singles, including two \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number ones \"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\", and an All-4-One cover of \"I Turn to You\". The album helped Aguilera win the Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the 2000 ceremony. Aguiera's two following studio albums \"Mi Reflejo\" and \"My Kind of Christmas\" were subsequently released in the end of 2000. The former topped the \"Billboard\" Top Latin Albums for nineteen consecutive weeks and was certified six times platinum in the Latin field by the RIAA. It won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the 2001 ceremony.\n\nIn support of her albums, Aguilera embarked on her first concert tour Christina Aguilera in Concert from mid-2000 to early 2001, visiting North America, Europe, South America, and Japan. Thanks to her success throughout 2000, \"Billboard\" recognized Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of the Year. Despite her early success, Aguilera was displeased with the music and image her management Steve Kurtz had aligned her to, feeling unable to control her own image. Aguilera's views of Kurtz's influence in matters of her creative direction, the role of being her exclusive personal manager, and over-scheduling had in part caused her to seek legal means of terminating their management contract. In October 2000, Aguilera filed a breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit against Kurtz for improper, undue and inappropriate influence over her professional activities, as well as fraud. After terminating Kurtz's services, Irving Azoff was hired as her new manager.\n\nAguilera's first take on more artistic control was expressed in the 2001 \"Moulin Rouge!\" cover of Labelle's \"Lady Marmalade\", which also saw the contribution of Pink, Mya and Lil Kim. Originally opposed by RCA executives for being \"too urban\" and \"too Rockwilder and Missy\", Aguilera insisted on recording the song. \"Lady Marmalade\" topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for five weeks based on airplay alone, becoming the first airplay-only track in history to remain on the chart's top spot for more than one week. It earned a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 2002 ceremony. Later in 2001, an album titled \"Just Be Free\" containing demo tracks recorded by Aguilera in 1994 and 1995 was released by Warlock Records without Aguilera's permission. She subsequently filed a suit against Warlock Records and the album's producers to stop the release. The two parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.\n\nWhen planning her fourth studio album, Aguilera leaned towards a new artistic direction that she felt had more musical and lyrical depth. She named the album \"Stripped\" and explained that the title represented \"a new beginning, a re-introduction of [herself] as a new artist in a way\". For the album, Aguilera served as executive producer and co-wrote most of the songs. The album was preceded by the single \"Dirrty\", which was released to shed Aguilera's teen pop image and express her sexuality and aggression. Its accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting various sexual fetishes and concepts. Aguilera's new image presented in the video started to overshadow her music, generating widespread criticism from both her peers including Shakira and Jessica Simpson and the public. Aguilera defended her new image, explaining that \"I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.\"\n\nThe final cut of \"Stripped\" incorporated various genres from flamenco and R&B to rock and lyrically revolved around the theme of self-esteem while also discussing sex and gender equality. It was released in October 2002 to mixed critical reviews; Jancee Dunn from the \"Rolling Stone\" praised Aguilera's vocals yet panned the album for its lack of musical concentration. The album was nonetheless a commercial success, peaking at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 and has sold over 4.3 million copies in the United States. It was a major success in the United Kingdom, having sold 2 million copies and became the second highest-selling album by a female US artist of the 2000s decade, behind Norah Jones with \"Come Away with Me\". \"Stripped\" has sold over 12 million copies worldwide. The album was followed by four singles, \"Beautiful\", \"Fighter\", \"Can't Hold Us Down\", and \"The Voice Within\". \"Beautiful\" received universal acclaim for positive portrayal of the LGBT community and was the album's most commercially successful single, peaking at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It earned Aguilera a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 ceremony. The song was later listed at number 52 among the 100 Best Songs of the 2000s by the \"Rolling Stone\" in 2011.\n\nDuring the promotion of \"Stripped\", Aguilera cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and debuting several tattoos and piercings. She co-headlined the Justified and Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake from June to September 2003 in support of \"Stripped\" and Timberlake's album \"Justified\", before embarking on her solo The Stripped Tour until December. Aguilera garnered media attention after attending the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\". Later that year, she was the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she won an award for Best Female. \"Billboard\" also announced Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of 2003.\n\nIn 2004, Aguilera recorded a revised version of Rose Royce's \"Car Wash\" with Missy Elliott for the animated film \"Shark Tale\", in which she was also a voice actress. Later that year, she and Nelly performed \"Tilt Ya Head Back\" at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards; the song was subsequently released as a single from Nelly's album \"Sweat\". Aguilera also contributed vocals to Herbie Hancock's 2005 cover of Leon Russell's \"A Song for You\", which was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 48th ceremony. During this time, Aguilera started working on her follow-up studio album while embracing an image inspired by public figures of the \"Old Hollywood glam era\" including Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, and Mary Pickford, debuting blonde curly hair and retro-styled makeup.\n\nAguilera's fifth studio album \"Back to Basics\" was released in August 2006. The double album, according to Aguilera, was \"a throwback to the 20s, 30s, and 40s-style jazz, blues, and feel-good soul music, but with a modern twist\". During the recording process, Aguilera was much inspired by works of classic blues and soul singers including Otis Redding, Millie Jackson, and Nina Simone, which she described as \"music that really had heart\". The album was released to generally positive critical feedback, with compliments regarding its retro-oriented styles and Aguilera's vocals. It debuted atop the \"Billboard\" 200 and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, of which 1.7 million copies were sold in the United States. The album was preceded by \"Ain't No Other Man\", which reached number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and has sold 1.7 million digital copies in the United States. The song's music video saw Aguilera portraying her new alter ego Baby Jane. The single won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards, where Aguilera performed a rendition of \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" in tribute of James Brown.\n\n\"Back to Basics\" was succeeded by two singles, \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\". \"Slow Down Baby\" was released exclusively in Australia as the fourth single, while \"Oh Mother\" was the fourth in Europe. In support of \"Back to Basics\", Aguilera embarked on the Back to Basics Tour, commencing in November 2006 in Europe, visiting North America, Asia, and Oceania, and ending in October 2008 in the United Arab Emirates. \"Billboard\" Boxscore announced the Back to Basic Tour as the highest-grossing solo female tour of 2007, with US$48.1M grossed. \"Forbes\" recognized Aguilera as the nineteenth-richest woman in entertainment as of January 2007, with a net worth of US$60 million.\n\nLater that year, she appeared in the Martin Scorsese documentary \"Shine a Light\" chronicling a two-day Rolling Stones concert in New York City's Beacon Theatre, in which Aguilera performs \"Live with Me\" alongside the band's lead vocalist Mick Jagger. In commemoration of a decade-long career in the music industry, Aguilera released a greatest hits album titled \"\" exclusively through Target on November 11, 2008, in the United States. In addition to previous singles, it included four newly-recorded electropop-oriented songs, two of which are remade versions of two previous singles. Aguilera revealed that the newly-recorded tracks featured \"a very futurisic, robotic sound\" that served as a preview for her follow-up studio album. The release peaked at number nine on the \"Billboard\" 200, while its titular single \"Keeps Gettin' Better\" charted at number five on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In 2009, \"Billboard\" recognized Aguilera as the 20th most successful artist of the 2000s.\n\nAguilera's sixth studio album \"Bionic\" was released in June 2010. The album drew inspirations from electronic genres, which had influenced Aguilera during her pregnancy. Critical response to the album was mixed, with some critics not welcoming the change in musical styles as well as the content of the lyrics for being \"cringeworthy\". \"Bionic\" struggled to match the chart impact and sales of her previous albums, peaking at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200 and has sold 315,000 copies in the United States. \"Not Myself Tonight\" and \"You Lost Me\" were released as singles internationally, while \"Woohoo\" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj was released as a single in the United States and several European countries, and \"I Hate Boys\" was released exclusively to Australian airplay services.\n\nIn November 2010, Aguilera starred alongside Cher in the film \"Burlesque\". The film was written and directed by Steve Antin, and grossed $90 million. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, who criticized it for being \"campy and clichéd\", yet praised Aguilera's acting. \"Burlesque\" received a nomination for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 68th Golden Globe Awards. Aguilera contributed eight tracks to the film's , while Cher performed the other two. The soundtrack reached number 18 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nAt the Super Bowl XLV in February 2011, Aguilera omitted a few lines while performing the U.S. national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". She later apologized, saying, \"I got so caught up in the moment of the song that I lost my place. I can only hope that everyone could feel my love for this country and that the true spirit of its anthem still came through\". She performed at the opening act of the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, alongside Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, Yolanda Adams, and Florence Welch, paying tribute to Aretha Franklin. In April 2011, Aguilera served as a coach on the television series \"The Voice\" and went on for its three first seasons until December 2012. During the first season, Aguilera was featured on Maroon 5's single \"Moves like Jagger\" upon the invitation of the group's lead vocalist and Aguilera's fellow \"The Voice\" coach Adam Levine. The single peaked atop \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and became one of the best-selling digital singles worldwide with 7 million copies sold.\n\nAguilera's seventh studio album \"Lotus\" was released in November 2012. She described it as a \"rebirth\" of herself after the personal struggles she had overcome during the \"Bionic\" album era. It peaked at number seven on the \"Billboard\" 200 and has sold 290,000 copies in the United States. The album has become her least commercially successful album so far. The album was preceded by two singles, \"Your Body\" and \"Just a Fool\". During the promotion of \"Lotus\" in December 2012, Aguilera was temporarily replaced by Shakira for the fourth season of \"The Voice\" and returned for the fifth season in September 2013.\nWhile Aguilera's seventh studio album \"Lotus\" was commercially unsuccessful, she subsequently found her revitalized success through collaborations with other artists. She was featured on Pitbull's single \"Feel This Moment\" in January 2013, which peaked at number eight on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. She subsequently appeared on Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández's cover of \"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\", which earned a diamond certification in Mexico. Aguilera's duet of \"Say Something\" with A Great Big World, released in November 2013, was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, earning a six-time platinum certification from the RIAA and winning a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\nFor the sixth and seventh seasons of \"The Voice\", Aguilera was respectively replaced by Shakira and Gwen Stefani, clarifying that she wanted to devote her time to her family. She subsequently returned as a coach for the eighth and tenth seasons; for the latter she won with her contestant Alisan Porter and became the first female coach to win the show.\n\nIn April 2015, Aguilera played a recurring role as singer Jade St. John on the third season of ABC's musical drama series \"Nashville\". In March 2016, Aguilera and Rutler were announced as executive producers for a new music-based game show, \"Tracks\", to air on Spike TV. Aguilera recorded a song titled \"Change\", which was dedicated to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting as well as Christina Grimmie, who was fatally shot in Orlando the day before the nightclub shooting, in June 2016. The proceedings were donated to the National Compassion Fund to benefit the victims' families. She further recorded a disco song titled \"Telepathy\" featuring Nile Rodgers for the soundtrack of Netflix original series \"The Get Down\" in August 2016, contributed as a voice actress for \"The Emoji Movie\", and was announced to had been cast for the film \"Zoe\" in May 2017.\n\nAguilera released her eighth studio album, titled \"Liberation\", on June 15. The album debuted at #6 on the \"Billboard\" 200, becoming her seventh US Top 10 album. Its lead promo single, \"Accelerate\", was released on May 3, while second single \"Fall In Line\", featuring Demi Lovato, was released on May 20, one day after they performed it together on the 2018 \"Billboard\" Music Awards. She also embarked on the Liberation Tour, her first concert tour in over a decade.\n\nAguilera is a soprano, having a vocal range spanning four octaves (from B♭ to C♯), four notes, a semitone and the whistle register. Since the start of her career Aguilera's voice has been compared to that of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. David Browne writing for \"The New York Times\" noted that Aguilera's vocal performance was highly influenced by Carey and Houston, sharing that \"Aguilera has been one of the foremost practitioners of the overpowering, Category 5 vocal style known as melisma\", and \"Ms. Carey, Ms. Houston and Ms. Aguilera, to name its three main champions, are most associated with the period from the late '80s through the late '90s\". A journal by Ann Powers for the \"Los Angeles Times\" said there are influences of Barbra Streisand, Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin on Aguilera's vocal style, opining that the \"Aguilera's Streisand-esque tendencies\" \"[help Aguilera] figure out how to become the 'great singer' she's been dubbed since she released her first single, the wise-beyond-its-years 'Genie in a Bottle', at 18\". Sasha Frere-Jones wrote in \"The New Yorker\", \"Aguilera doesn't need to reincarnate Sarah Vaughan to be a serious singer. She already is one, in the tradition of nineteen-nineties pop and R&B, skillfully deploying melisma for razzle-dazzle\". In 2003, Aguilera was placed 5th on MTV's \"Best Voices in Music Ever\" list, while ranking atop both COVE and Latina magazine's best Pop and Latina vocalist of all time in 2004 and 2013 respectively. In a review for \"Liberation\", Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" describes Aguilera's vocal versatility, stating; \"Nothing less than high drama suits Christina Aguilera's voice. She can be brassy, tearful, sultry, gritty, breathy, sweet or furious. She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it's about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow\".\n\nAguilera has, however, been criticized for her excessive use of melisma and oversinging on songs and in concerts. John Eskow of \"The Huffington Post\" named Aguilera a main proponent for \"oversouling\", described as the \"gratuitous and confected melisma\". Lucy Davies, a writer for BBC Music, opined that although Aguilera had \"a stunning voice\", she \"could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the 'y-e-e-eeeh, woah yeh's'\". Longtime producer Linda Perry, who wrote the song \"Beautiful\", revealed about the recording sessions with Aguilera, \"I tried to keep it straight. I told her to get rid of the finger waves. Every time she'd start going into 'hoo-ha', I'd stop the tape. I'm like, 'You're doing it again'\". Perry ended up using the song's first take adding, \"She had a hard time accepting that as the final track. She's a perfectionist. She knows her voice really well, and she knows what's going on. She can hear things that nobody else would catch.\" An editor from \"Entertainment Weekly\", Chris Willman, stated that the oversinging on Aguilera's albums was inspired by Carey, writing that \"the Mariah venerators don't get away with it so easily. Aguilera, for one thing, has a slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song\".\n\nAguilera has credited blues singer Etta James as her main influence and inspiration, elaborating, \"Etta is my all-time favorite singer. I've said it for the last seven years – since I had my first debut record out – in every interview\". Following James' death in 2012, Aguilera was asked to perform \"At Last\" at James' funeral. Prior to the performance, Aguilera revealed, \"There's a line in this song that says 'I found a dream that I could speak to.' And for me that dream, all my life, has been Etta James\". Other classic artists, including Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, and Ella Fitzgerald, are also Aguilera's major influences; her fifth studio album \"Back to Basics\" is inspired by vintage jazz, blues and soul music records by them.\n\nAguilera mentions Whitney Houston as another influence, having performed many of her songs in her early years during talent shows. She also cites Mariah Carey and Celine Dion as an inspiration, and covered the latter's songs: \"These Are the Special Times\" on \"My Kind of Christmas\", and \"The Prayer\" on the NBC reality singing competition \"The Voice\". Aguilera's debut album producer Ron Harris revealed that Aguilera during her recording sessions for \"Christina Aguilera\" would constantly listen Brandy's music, studying and trying to replicate her adlibs. According to author Pier Dominguez of the book \"Christina Aguilera: A Star is Made\", Aguilera stated that Carey and her debut single, \"Vision of Love\" (1990), had the biggest influence on her vocal style. Aguilera points out the musical film \"The Sound of Music\" and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, as her first inspiration for singing and performing. At the age of six, the film helped Aguilera cope with her violent childhood, \"Bad things happened in my home; there was violence. \"The Sound of Music\" looked like a form of release.\" Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as two biggest inspirations for her image, \"for being re-inventive and being brave as strong females, to explore whatever, even if they do get bad press. It's just like they were fearless.\" During the promotion of \"Back to Basics\", her image was also inspired by the \"Golden age of Hollywood\" actresses including Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Carole Lombard, Greta Garbo and Veronica Lake. Aguilera is also inspired by her \"Burlesque\" co-star, Cher: \"I have always had tremendous respect for her. She is a woman who did everything before anyone else did it. She is an icon and she inspired me through some of my career. We've had similar costumes too!\"\n\nAguilera frequently blends elements of pop, R&B, dance-pop and soul music into her projects, her records typically include a combination of ballads and uptempo tracks. \"Christina Aguilera\" (1999) prominently displayed teen pop and dance-pop music, while \"Mi Reflejo\" (2000) takes inspiration from Latin music. Her first Christmas album, \"My Kind of Christmas\", combines covers of Christmas standards and several original dance-pop tracks. Aiming for musical diversity and artistic growth, Aguilera worked with R&B, rock, hip hop, and Latin music for \"Stripped\" (2002). David Browne from \"Entertainment Weekly\" credited the release with distancing Aguilera from her pop contemporaries. Aguilera leaned towards R&B, blues, jazz, and soul on \"Back to Basics\" (2006).\n\nIn contrast, \"Bionic\" (2010) sees significant use from futuristic electronic music, described as an electropop album. The soundtrack for her 2010 feature film \"Burlesque\" (2010) was influenced by \"Cabaret\", and featured several established songs that were redone as dance numbers in a fashion similar to \"Moulin Rouge!\" (2001). Aguilera partnered with mainstream producers including Shellback and Max Martin during production of \"Lotus\" (2012); when discussing her interactions with the latter, she commented that \"He's known about me but we haven't crossed paths,\" adding \"Those records were the kind I wanted to stray apart from. If you look at what I did in the past (after my debut), I always try to do things that will challenge me and challenge the listener, too.\"\n\nAguilera has commented that she feels a sense of responsibility to reference portions of her personal life so that \"people that can relate might not feel as alone in the circumstance.\" Many of her works consequently discuss love; she has also co-written two tracks which dealt with the domestic abuse throughout her childhood. Aguilera has frequently mentioned feminism in her music; she has expressed her belief that sexuality is \"very empowering\", and has commented that \"If I want to be sexual, it's for my own appreciation and enjoyment! That's why I like to talk about the fact that sometimes I am attracted to women. I appreciate their femininity and beauty.\" She has alluded to her physical attractions to women in other interviews as well. Her \"Can't Hold Us Down\" from \"Stripped\" denounces gender-related double standards, in which men are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave in a similar fashion are disdained. The main theme of \"Bionic\" was also about woman empowerment; Hermione Hoby from \"The Guardian\" opined that \"she incites more of a sisterly spirit of collaboration, including riot grrrl feminists Le Tigre. Aguilera's not shy of the odd feministic declaration herself.\" In regards to production, Aguilera has often verbalized her preference of working with more \"obscure\" collaborators, and noted that she is not necessarily inclined to contact \"the No.1 chart-toppers in music\" because of their popular demand. \"The New York Times\" Kelefa Sanneh described her decision to work with DJ Premier on \"Back to Basics\" as \"a decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely.\"\n\nAguilera has reinvented her public image on numerous occasions throughout her career. In the later 1990s, her then-manager Steve Kurtz marketed her as a bubblegum pop entertainer to capitalize on the genre's financial lure, which earned her recognition as a teen idol. Aguilera introduced her alter ego \"Xtina\" during 2002 and 2003, which presented an increasingly provocative persona. During this time, she dyed her hair black, debuted several piercings, and participated in several nude pictorials for publications. In 2004, Aguilera embraced a more \"mature\" image with retro-styled hair and makeup, which was inspired by classic movie stars including Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich and Mary Pickford. This reinvention was named \"Baby Jane\" in 2006, an alter ego which was taken from the 1962 film \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\". Aguilera received widespread criticism over her curvy figure from gaining weight in 2012. She later received favorable media attention after a significant weight loss in 2013. In 2018 Aguilera appeared bare-faced without makeup and retouching on the cover of Paper magazine and received widespread praise.\nAguilera is considered a pop icon, and has frequently garnered comparisons to Britney Spears. David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said that Aguilera is \"too eager not to offend\" in her mild-mannered music, making her a \"good girl pretending to be bad\", and also said that Spears' \"artificial-sweetener voice\" was a welcome change of pace from Aguilera's \"numbing vocal gymnastics\". Matthew Horton from Virgin Media suggested that Aguilera was a more impressive performer than Spears despite her lower sales figures. Aguilera has also been regarded as a sex symbol. A 2003 issue of \"Maxim\" magazine that she covered became its best-selling issue; Aguilera was named \"Sexiest Woman of the Year\" by its subscribers later that year, and also earned the magazine its best-selling issue after posing on the cover that year. Additionally recognized as a gay icon, she was the first honoree on The Abbey's Gay Walk of Fame for her contributions to the LGBT community. The music video for \"Beautiful\" earned Aguilera a GLAAD Media Award for its positive portrayal of the LGBT community.\n\nFashion has also been a part of Aguilera's music career and image. She has frequently worn clothes designed by Roberto Cavalli, John Galliano, Marc Jacobs, and Alexander McQueen. During the Back to Basics Tour in 2006, Aguilera performed in a stole made of fur designed by Roberto Cavalli, unaware that it was made from real fur of a white fox. After receiving a video about the treatment of foxes from PETA vice president Dan Mathews, Aguilera replaced it with a faux-fur stole, further stating that she was \"very upset\" because she \"only ever wears fake fur\". Aguilera's costumes from \"Burlesque\" were featured in the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising's Art of Motion Picture Costume Design exhibition. Wax figures of Aguilera are located at Madame Tussauds wax museum in London and New York City.\n\nAguilera has sold 37.9 million records in the United States, and over 75 million albums and singles worldwide. Gregory Hicks from \"The Michigan Daily\" opined that \"Aguilera deserves to be known as one of the greatest artists to ever hit the pop industry.\" In 2012, VH1 named Aguilera the eighth greatest woman in the music industry. Aguilera has also been recognized as one of the greatest vocalists of all time, and is commonly referred to as \"The Voice of a Generation\". Aguilera topped Cove magazine's list of \"The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists\". She was ranked fifth in MTV and Blender magazine's 2003 countdown of the 22 Greatest Voices in Music. In November 2008, \"Rolling Stone\" placed Aguilera at number 58 on its list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, writing that \"[Aguilera] has had the finesse and power of a blues queen ever since she was a child star\". At the 2013 People's Choice Awards, Aguilera was awarded the People's Voice Award, which recognized Aguilera's ability to reach millions of people across various genres. In 2013, Aguilera was one of \"Time\"s 100 Most Influential People in the World. In the article for the magazine, Celine Dion wrote, \"Without a doubt, [Aguilera]'s one of the most talented artists the world has ever seen and heard, and I think she's going to continue to amaze us for many, many years to come.\"\n\nAguilera is also well known for her television and music video impact; in 2012, Jon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" commented that Aguilera \"will be remembered for her glamour, her scandalous take on femme-pop and her Brobdingnagian voice, and ... as the person who almost single-handedly reshaped music-competition reality programming\". She was considered as one of the greatest women of the music video era by VH1. Aguilera's use of sexual imagery has catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, co-founder of \"The Vagenda\", opined that the provocative dance routines in Aguilera's music videos are \"empowering\". Writing for The Hampton Institute, critic Terry Young, Jr. commented that Aguilera \"redefined the 21st century female pop performer\". He added that following the release of \"Stripped\", \"artists like Spears and Beyoncé became more comfortable expressing sexuality and no longer felt the need to sell the notion of innocence\". Aguilera's works have earned her numerous awards and accolades, including five Grammy Awards. In November 2010, Aguilera was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In October 2012, Aguilera's costumes and video collection was included on the \"Women Who Rock\" exhibition by the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Aguilera has inspired various artists, including: Ariana Grande, Tinashe, Meghan Trainor, Jordin Sparks, Demi Lovato, Camryn, Kelly Clarkson, Alexandra Burke, Charli XCX, Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, Ashley Tisdale, Charice, Sam Smith, Sabrina Carpenter, Candice Glover, Jasmine Trias, Karmin, Jessie J, and Louisa Johnson.\n\nLady Gaga cited Aguilera and her cover of All-4-One's \"I Turn to You\" as an inspiration for Gaga's vocal range, elaborating; \"When I was 15, I was singing \"I Turn to You\" at the top of my lungs. She was an inspiration to me to have a wider vocal range.\" Demi Lovato explained that she was inspired by Aguilera's themes, \"I had a lot of respect for Whitney Houston, and Christina Aguilera, on some songs where she was really amazing and wasn't trying to be sexy or anything like that. I just found that I had more respect for artists that didn't talk about that stuff, and those were the ones that were more successful.\" Aguilera's works has also inspired some athletes, including American figure skater Johnny Weir and American swimmer Dana Vollmer.\n\nDuring Christina Aguilera in Concert tour, Aguilera was involved in a romantic relationship with dancer Jorge Santos, which ultimately ended in September 2001.\n\nAguilera began dating marketing executive Jordan Bratman in 2003, and became engaged in February 2005 after two years together. The couple married on November 19, 2005 at an estate in Napa County, California.\nOn January 12, 2008, Aguilera gave birth to a son with Bratman.\n\nAguilera and Bratman separated in September 2010. Aguilera filed for divorce from Bratman in October, requesting joint legal and physical custody of their son. After reaching a private settlement and custody deal, their divorce was finalized on April 15, 2011.\n\nAguilera concurrently began a romantic relationship with Matthew Rutler, who served as an assistant on the set of \"Burlesque\". On March 1, 2011, the couple was arrested for public intoxication in West Hollywood. They were later released on bail and no charges were filed.\n\nAguilera became engaged to Rutler in February 2014. She gave birth to their daughter in August 2014.\n\nIn 2000, Aguilera supported a program called Come on Over and Do Something, which aimed to \"encourage kids to get involved in their communities and make a difference.\" A year later, she signed a letter from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to the South Korean government requesting that the country stop its alleged killing of dogs for food. In 2010, Aguilera auctioned tickets for her planned tour for Christie's A Bid to Save the Earth, which benefited the non-profit environmental groups Conservation International, Oceana, Natural Resources Defense Council, and The Central Park Conservancy. Aguilera contributed US$200,000 to the Women's Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh in December 2003, and has worked with Lifetime Television's \"End violence against women\" campaign.\n\nIn 2005, Aguilera contributed \"Beautiful\" to the compilation album \"Love Rocks\", which proceeds benefited the Human Rights Campaign. Aguilera participated in the AIDS Project Los Angeles' Artists Against AIDS \"What's Going On?\" cover project, and became the face for MAC Cosmetics and spokesperson for MAC AIDS Fund in 2004. Singer Elton John featured Aguilera in his charity book \"4 Inches\", which benefitted the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2004 United States presidential election, Aguilera was featured on billboards for the \"Only You Can Silence Yourself\" online voter registration drive run by the nonpartisan, non-profit campaign \"Declare Yourself\". In these political advertisements, shot by David LaChapelle, Aguilera was shown with her mouth sewn shut to symbolize the effects of not voting. In late 2007, Aguilera became the spokesperson for \"Rock the Vote\", through which she encouraged young people to vote in the 2008 presidential election. In 2005, Aguilera donated her wedding gifts to American charities in support of Hurricane Katrina victims, and performed at \"Unite of the Stars\" concert for Unite Against Hunger in Johannesburg, South Africa and for the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund at the Coca-Cola Dome.\n\nIn 2008, Aguilera headlined London's Africa Rising charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall, which raised awareness for finding substantial issues facing the continent. That year, Aguilera appeared on the Turkish version of \"Deal or No Deal\", \"Var mısın? Yok musun?\", and donated proceeds to a charity program for orphans. In 2009, Aguilera became the global spokesperson for World Hunger Relief; she and Bratman traveled to Guatemala with the World Food Programme to bring awareness to issues including its high malnutrition rate, and met with local families and beneficiaries of WFP's nutrition programs. Aguilera has helped raise over $148 million for WFP and other hunger relief agencies in 45 countries.\n\nIn response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Aguilera donated a signed Chrysler 300 which was auctioned for relief efforts. She additionally appeared on the \"\" telethon that January, where donations directly benefited Oxfam America, Partners In Health, Red Cross and UNICEF. She was featured on a public service announcement alongside former boxer Muhammad Ali to raise funds for the World Food Programme's efforts to bring food to survivors of the earthquake. Aguilera was nominated for a VH1 Do Something Award for her work with the organization and her efforts in response to the earthquake. In 2010, Aguilera was appointed UN ambassador for the World Food Programme. Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Aguilera performed \"Beautiful\" to open the \"\" benefit telethon; all proceeds went to the American Red Cross. That year, Aguilera and David Novak received the George McGovern Leadership Award. The following year Aguilera was honored with the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian of the Year Award.\n\nIn 2000, Aguilera was the face for make-up line Fetish, where she worked in choosing colors and packaging for the line. That same year, an interactive CD-ROM was produced called \"Christina Aguilera: Follow Your Dreams\" released by Simon & Schuster Interactive which features games and quizzes, plus Aguilera herself talking about accomplishing her goals. Throughout her career, Aguilera has endorsed several brands, including Sears, Levi's, Skechers, Mercedes-Benz, Versace, Virgin Mobile, Orange (UK), Oreo, Sony Ericsson and soft drink giants Coca-Cola, and Pepsi in 2001 and 2006, respectively. In 2004, Aguilera earned £200,000 (about $300,000) for opening the summer sale at London's Harrods store and appeared in an advertisement for MAC Cosmetics Viva Glam V campaign. Following the birth of her son in 2008, she was reportedly paid $1.5 million by \"People\" for her baby pictures, which became the ninth most expensive celebrity baby photographs ever taken. In 2008, jewelry designer Stephen Webster and friend of Aguilera released \"Shattered\", a collection of sterling silver pieces, through Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. Aguilera, who inspired the collection, was featured as a Hitchcock heroine. They reprised their work together for Webster's 2009 spring line. In 2011, Aguilera attended São Paulo Fashion Week to premiere her new line of clothing for Brazilian department store C&A, which launched in April.\n\nAguilera is the No. 1 awarded celebrity brand, winner of 13 awards globally. Her first fragrance, Xpose, was released in Europe in late 2004 and sold relatively well. Through Procter & Gamble, Aguilera released her signature fragrance, Simply Christina, in 2007. In Christmas 2007, the fragrance became the number one perfume in the United Kingdom, and later in 2009 it was the country's 4th best selling perfume. The perfume won as the people's choice for favorite celebrity fragrance at the annual UK Fifi Awards 2008. She released her third fragrance, Inspire, accompanied with a body care collection, in September 2008. It was Aguilera's first fragrance released outside of Europe. Her worldwide ad campaign included a television ad shot by David LaChapelle and was released in the United States in Macy's department stores. The release coincided with Macy's 150th anniversary which featured Aguilera in commemorative photos. She released her fourth fragrance, By Night, in October 2009, which became the third best selling fragrance in the United Kingdom in 2009. The range was further augmented by Royal Desire in 2010, Secret Potion in 2011, Red Sin in 2012, Unforgettable in 2013, Woman in 2014, Touch of Seduction in 2015, Glam X in 2016 and Definition in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8618", "title": "David Beckham", "text": "David Beckham\n\nDavid Robert Joseph Beckham, (; born 2 May 1975) is an English retired professional footballer and current President of Inter Miami CF. He played for Manchester United, Preston North End, Real Madrid, Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain and the England national team, for which he held the appearance record for an outfield player until 2016. He is the first English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States and France. He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies.\n\nKnown for his range of passing, crossing ability and bending free-kicks as a right winger, Beckham was runner up in the Ballon d'Or, twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year and in 2004 was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2008. A global ambassador for the sport, Beckham is regarded as a British cultural icon.\n\nBeckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 aged 17. With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA Champions League in 1999. He then played four seasons with Real Madrid, winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club. In July 2007 Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy. While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with Milan in 2009 and 2010. He was the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games.\n\nIn international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure. He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and two UEFA European Championship tournaments, in 2000 and 2004.\n\nBeckham has consistently ranked among the highest earners in football, and in 2013 was listed as the highest-paid player in the world, having earned over $50 million in the previous 12 months. He has been married to Victoria Beckham since 1999 and they have four children. He has been a UNICEF UK ambassador since 2005, and in 2015 he launched \"7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund\". In 2014, MLS announced that Beckham and a group of investors would own an Inter Miami CF, which will begin in 2020.\n\nBeckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England. He is the son of Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan \"Ted\" Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, July–September 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married at the London Borough of Hackney in 1969. He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He regularly played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary School and Chingford County High School. In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, \"At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do.\" Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish, and Beckham has referred to himself as \"half Jewish\" and wrote in his autobiography \"I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion\". In his book \"Both Feet on the Ground\", he stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.\n\nHis parents were fanatical Manchester United supporters who frequently travelled to Old Trafford from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of Bobby Charlton's football schools in Manchester and won the chance to take part in a training session with Barcelona, as part of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers , which was coached by his father, Stuart Underwood, and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against West Ham United in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club Leyton Orient, Norwich City and attended Tottenham Hotspur's school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for Brimsdown Rovers' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990. He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a Youth Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991.\n\nHaving signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991, Beckham was part of a group of young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in . Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.\n\nManchester United again reached the , where they faced Leeds United. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2–0 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4–1 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.\n\nBeckham then went to Preston North End on loan for part of the 1994–95 season to get some first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, notably scoring directly from a corner kick.\n\nBeckham returned to Manchester and made his Premier League debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995, in a goalless draw against Leeds United. He played four times for United in the league that season, as they finished second behind Blackburn Rovers, missing out on a third successive Premier League title by a single point. He was not in the squad for the FA Cup final with Everton on 20 May, which United lost 1–0, leaving the club without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.\n\nUnited manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\"), which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. When experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis left the club after the end of the 1994–95 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including Darren Anderton, Marc Overmars and Roberto Baggio, but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3–1 defeat at Aston Villa, with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game. However, United recovered from this early season defeat and the young players performed well.\n\nBeckham swiftly established himself as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier League title and FA Cup double that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against Chelsea and also providing the corner from which Eric Cantona scored in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points adrift of leaders Newcastle United at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his teammates had overhauled the Tynesiders at the top of the league by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. Despite playing regularly and to a consistently high standard for Manchester United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before Euro 1996.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1996–97 season, Beckham was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the Premier League season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against Wimbledon. With United leading 2–0, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line – 60 yards out – that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.\n\nHis goal celebration for his 60-yard strike saw him raise his arms as usual, but he walked away smiling rather than run as he often would. When Beckham scored the goal he was wearing Adidas Predator boots. In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002, the British public voted the goal No.18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. In a 2016 Sky Sports poll it was ranked the best opening day goal in Premier League history. During the 1996–97 season, Beckham became an automatic first-choice player at Manchester United, helping them to retain the Premier League championship, and was voted PFA Young Player of the Year by his peers. Manchester United started the 1997–98 season well but erratic performances in the second half of the season saw United finish second behind Arsenal.\nIn the 1998–99 season, he was part of the United team that won the treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League, a unique feat in English football. There had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but Beckham decided to stay at Manchester United.\n\nTo ensure they would win the Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham. There were reports suggesting that the opposition would allow themselves to be beaten to prevent their local rivals Arsenal from retaining the title, but Tottenham took an early lead in the match. Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 25 yards out into the top left corner of the goal and United went on to win the match and the league.\n\nBeckham played in central midfield in United's win over Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, since United's first string centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane were suspended for the match. United were losing the match 1–0 at the end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham. Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to him finishing runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.\n\nDespite Beckham's achievements in the 1998–99 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against Necaxa. It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him, but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in 1999–2000 by an 18-point margin, after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nBy the early 2000s, the relationship between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had gastroenteritis, but Ferguson was furious when Victoria Beckham was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages – then £50,000) and dropping him for a crucial match against United's rivals Leeds United. He later criticised Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been \"fair to his teammates\" Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin.\n\n\"He was never a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment, his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part.\"' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.\nHe was a key player in United's third successive league title in 2000–01, only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. He scored nine goals that season, all in the Premier League.\n\nOn 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against Deportivo de La Coruña, breaking the second metatarsal bone in his left foot. There was speculation in the British media that the injury might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was Argentine Aldo Duscher, and England and Argentina were due to meet in that year's World Cup. The injury prevented Beckham from playing for United for the rest of the season and they missed out on the Premier League title to Arsenal (also being knocked out of the Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen on away goals in the semi-finals), but he signed a three-year contract in May, following months of negotiations with the club, mostly concerning extra payments for his image rights. The income from his new contract, and his many endorsement deals, made him the highest-paid player in the world at the time. Despite the injury, 2001–02 was arguably Beckham's best season as a United player; he scored 11 goals in 28 league games, and a total of 16 goals in 42 games in all competitions, the best of his career.\n\nFollowing an injury early in the 2002–03 season, Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw\n\nBeckham had made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals. He also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one European Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years. By this stage, he was their joint second longest serving player behind Ryan Giggs (having joined them at the same time as Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes).\n\nAs the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer, but instead he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for €37 million on a four-year contract. Beckham was the latest signing in the \"Galácticos\" era of global stars signed by club president Florentino Pérez every summer. The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham. Though announced in mid-June, the transfer was completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club, after Laurie Cunningham and Steve McManaman. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt by club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano. Although Beckham had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and England, he was unable to wear it at Madrid as it was assigned to club captain Raúl. He decided to wear number 23 instead, citing his admiration of basketball player Michael Jordan, who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason behind his decision.\n\nIn the week before Beckham's presentation, Real named Carlos Queiroz as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham was reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid, since Queiroz had spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons. The presence of a global marketing icon such as Beckham, however, made this particular tour a financial smash for \"los Merengues\".\n\nShortly after his transfer to Real, Beckham also ended his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of SFX Europe, who had guided him through his career until that point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with Simon Fuller and his company 19 Entertainment, which already managed the career of Victoria. Beckham also appointed close friend Terry Byrne to be his personal manager.\nIn late August 2003, Real Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup over two legs versus RCD Mallorca, with Beckham scoring the final goal in a 3–0 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing in a star-laden team which included three former FIFA World Player of the Year recipients, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Luís Figo, in addition to Roberto Carlos, Raúl and Iker Casillas, Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5–3–2 formation, with two fullbacks Míchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos, often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man midfield, alongside Zidane and Figo.\n\nReal Madrid were runners-up in the Copa del Rey, were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning the team, whose president Pérez expected them to win either the Spanish league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of petrol. Victoria and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended the man before he reached the house.\n\nThe league season began with new head coach José Antonio Camacho at the helm, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant Mariano García Remón took over on temporary basis as Real's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling Ben Thatcher in an England match against Wales to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next caution, and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. The Football Association asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had \"made a mistake\" and apologised. He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against Valencia. Having received a yellow card, he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal.\n\nBy Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second position in the league, García Remón was dismissed, and Vanderlei Luxemburgo became the new head coach. However, the well-travelled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in second position. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against Getafe CF. A day later Luxemburgo was sacked and was replaced by Juan Ramón López Caro. By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga in number of assists.\nDuring the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards. \nReal Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005–06 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and only reached the last 16 in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal. The season also marked the end of an era for the club as Pérez resigned his post as president in January 2006, with Vicente Boluda named as replacement on an interim basis until the end of the season.\n\nThe summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as the club's presidential elections were held. Ramón Calderón became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials who served under the previous president was kept, including head coach López Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello, Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier José Antonio Reyes was normally preferred on the right wing. Of the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contractual negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatović announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.\n\nOn 11 January 2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for the LA Galaxy beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he continued to train with the team. A few days later, while speaking to the students at Villanueva University Center in Madrid, Calderón said that Beckham is \"going to Hollywood to be half a film star\", adding \"our technical staff were right not to extend his contract, which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except Los Angeles\".\n\nAbout a month later, however, Capello backtracked on his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match against Real Sociedad on 10 February 2007. The player immediately repaid his head coach's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free kick, as Real Madrid eventually recorded a 2–1 victory. In his final UEFA Champions League appearance for the club, Real Madrid were knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the round-of-16 stage (on the away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. Beckham played a pivotal role in all three Madrid goals in the home game, with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn describing his performance as \"world class\".\nOn 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, a 3–1 win over Mallorca which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. With Real down 0–1, Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by José Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals, leading the team to that season's La Liga title, their first since Beckham had signed with them and 30th overall in the club's history. Although Real and Barçelona both finished level on points, Madrid took the title because of their superior head-to-head record, capping a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham. With his wife and children, along with celebrity friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, watching from a luxury box at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, it was only Beckham's second piece of silverware since he joined the famous club.\n\nTowards the end of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after successfully fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful. Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival in the United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.\n\nA month after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, \"Forbes\" magazine reported that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600 million during Beckham's four years at the club.\n\nBeckham's involvement with Major League Soccer (MLS) began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side LA Galaxy. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the 2007 MLS SuperDraft.\n\nThe announcement made global headlines and elevated the league's profile. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250 million, the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment). To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5 million in total or $6.5 million per year.\n\nThe high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with Herbalife nutrition company worth US$20 million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home stadium, the Home Depot Center). LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) also reported an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as China, where the company had been working aggressively in Shanghai and Beijing for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO Tim Leiweke put it as follows: \"Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed\".\n\nIn the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an MLS expansion franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25 million whenever he stopped playing in the league – an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract. The league had a salary cap in place, requiring the creation of the Designated Player Rule for Beckham to bypass the cap; the rule was later nicknamed in his honor. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2 million home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills.\nBeckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members. Beckham chose to wear number 23. It was announced that Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over 250,000 prior to this formal introduction.\n\nIn parallel, Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in America. He made the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\", a few weeks earlier Adidas launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign \"Fútbol meets Football\" starring Beckham and NFL running back Reggie Bush, and \"W\" magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by Steven Klein. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air \"David Beckham: New Beginnings\" documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus Chelsea, which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by Simon Fuller, who in turn has a business relationship with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400 million headquarters in Century City with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival. That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special \"\" aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.\nOn Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0–1 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer. With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN. As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.\n\nThe day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's Museum of Contemporary Art, formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood A-listers, the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as \"Entertainment Tonight\" and \"Access Hollywood\".\n\nBeckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le Méridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.\n\nTwo weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute. Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pavón failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Landon Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip was at New England Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium's artificial surface.\n\nBeckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the SuperLiga semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain. He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2–0 victory, and a place in the North American SuperLiga final versus Pachuca on 29 August.\n\nDuring the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an MRI scan revealing that he had sprained his medial collateral ligament and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1–0 loss to the Chicago Fire. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league). Beckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training. Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the San Jose Earthquakes in the ninth minute. On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the Kansas City Wizards 3–1, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70 yards out. The goal marked the second time in Beckham's career that he had scored from his own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park. Overall, however, the Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.\n\nIn 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under Fabio Capello led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the World Cup qualifying matches in 2009. On 30 October 2008, Milan announced that Beckham was to join them on loan from 7 January 2009. Despite this and other speculation, Beckham made it clear that the move in no way signalled his intent to leave MLS and announced his intent to return to the Galaxy in time for the start of the 2009 season in March. Many at Milan both within and outside of the club expressed serious reservations about the transfer, with it considered by some players no more than a marketing move.\n\nBeckham was unveiled at Milan's training facility by the club's chief executive Adriano Galliani on 20 December 2008. The player chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by Christian Vieri, as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by Alexandre Pato and club vice captain Massimo Ambrosini, respectively. The day after his unveiling, Beckham was brought to San Siro where he got introduced to home fans by walking out on the pitch before the league match versus Udinese and proclaiming \"Forza Milan\" over the public address system. Afterwards, he and wife Victoria watched from a luxury box as Milan won 5–1.\nPlaying on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar Kaká in addition to several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers – 28-year-old Ronaldinho, and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo – as well as club veterans Paolo Maldini, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli, Gianluca Zambrotta, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive debut for the \"rossoneri\" in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 2009, playing 89 minutes of the 2–2 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio Olimpico. Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play him from the start. In Beckham's home debut against Fiorentina a week later, he turned in another understated performance on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1–0 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kaká, imploring him to stay.\n\nA noticeably older team, Ancelotti-coached Milan was proving a good fit for the 33-year-old Englishman. He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4–1 victory over Bologna on 25 January, his third appearance for the club. Though Beckham was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar fee for him. The rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when Beckham stated that he was seeking a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his England career through the 2010 World Cup. Milan, however, failed to match Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10–15 million range.\n\nStill, negotiations continued during a month of speculation. On 2 March, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Beckham's loan had been extended through mid-July. This was later confirmed by Beckham, revealing what was described as a unique \"timeshare\" deal, in which Beckham would play with L.A. from mid-July until the end of the 2009 MLS season.\n\nAfter his return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying \"Go home fraud\", and \"Part-time player\". The Galaxy, however, had a much more successful season than in previous years, rising from third to first in the Western Conference during Beckham's time with them. He remained a key part of the squad which saw Galaxy win the 2009 Western Conference final after a 2–0 overtime victory over the Houston Dynamo.\nIn the final on 22 November 2009, the Galaxy lost to Real Salt Lake by 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. Beckham also scored in the shootout.\n\nIn November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning in January 2010. On 6 January 2010, Beckham made a winning return in a Milan shirt, playing 75 minutes of a 5–2 victory over Genoa. On 16 February 2010, Beckham played against Manchester United for the first time since he left the club in 2003. He played 76 minutes of the match at the San Siro – which ended 3–2 to Manchester United – before being substituted for Clarence Seedorf.\n\nBeckham returned to Old Trafford for the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2. Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.\n\nIn Milan's next game, against Chievo, Beckham suffered a torn left Achilles tendon, causing him to miss the World Cup as well as the MLS season due to the injury, which took him out of action for the next five months. Doctor Sakari Orava performed surgery on Beckham's tendon in Turku, Finland, on 15 March 2010. After the operation, Orava affirmed that, \"it went quite fine. The prognosis is he needs a rehabilitation for the next few months, and the plaster cast is the next six to eight weeks. I would say that [it will be] maybe four months before he's running, but six months before he's jumping and kicking.\"\n\nOn 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the Galaxy's 3–1 win over Columbus Crew. On 4 October, Beckham scored a trademark free kick in a 2–1 win over Chivas USA to mark his first goal in 2010. On 24 October, Beckham scored his second goal of the season in the Galaxy's 2–1 win over FC Dallas which secured them their second successive Western Conference title and first MLS Supporters' Shield since 2002.\n\nDuring January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, Beckham trained with Tottenham Hotspur. Rumours in the media claimed that the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, according to Spurs manager Harry Redknapp, the move was blocked by Galaxy, who wanted a full final season from their number 23. As a result, he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three years earlier. With Beckham playing in the centre of midfield, the Galaxy won the 2011 MLS cup.\n\nOn 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4–1 victory over Sporting Kansas City. On 9 July, Beckham scored directly from a corner in a 2–1 win over Chicago Fire, repeating a feat he also achieved while playing for Preston North End.\n\nAfter having his best season with the Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite group of players to have won league titles in three countries, when Los Angeles won their third MLS Cup against the Houston Dynamo, winning 1–0 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and fellow designated player Robbie Keane.\n\nFollowing the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive Supporters' Shield, having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011. Despite being 36, he stated that he did not intend to retire. Beckham was heavily linked with Paris Saint-Germain, but on 18 January 2012, Galaxy announced Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles. In May 2012, Beckham and his victorious teammates were received by President of the United States Barack Obama at the White House.\n\nBeckham helped the Galaxy to a fourth-place finish in the MLS Western Conference 2012 regular season with Beckham scoring seven goals and adding nine assists. The Galaxy defeated Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the San Jose Earthquakes, and Seattle Sounders FC on their way to the MLS Cup final, where they defeated the Houston Dynamo 3–1 to retain the cup. He was subbed off in the 89th minute for Marcelo Sarvas and was given a standing ovation at their home venue. Beckham had earlier announced that the 2012 MLS Cup Final would be his final game with the Galaxy despite having another year remaining on his contract.\n\nOn 31 January 2013, ahead of the transfer deadline it was announced that Beckham would be undergoing a medical with Paris Saint-Germain ahead of a potential move to the Ligue 1 side. Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club later that afternoon and confirmed that his entire salary during his time in Paris would be donated to a local children's charity. His PSG debut came on 24 February 2013, when he came off the bench in the 76th minute in a Ligue 1 home match against Marseille. This made him the 400th player in the history of the club. On 12 May 2013, Beckham won a fourth different top flight winners' medal after PSG beat Lyon 1–0 to claim the Ligue 1 title.\n\nOn 16 May 2013, Beckham announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of that year's French football season. Following his decision to retire at the end of the 2012–13 season, Beckham was given specially designed boots in the colours of the Union Jack to wear in his final game. These boots had the names of his wife and children stitched on to them. On 18 May 2013, Beckham was made captain in his final home game against Brest. In this game, Beckham assisted a goal by Matuidi from a corner. Beckham was subbed after 80 minutes, receiving hugs from his fellow players and manager, as well as a standing ovation from fans. PSG went on to win the game 3–1.\n\nBeckham made his first appearance for the England national team on 1 September 1996, in a World Cup qualifying match against Moldova.\n\nBeckham had played in all of England's qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup and was part of the England squad at the World Cup finals in France, but the team's manager Glenn Hoddle publicly accused him of not concentrating on the tournament, and he did not start in either of England's first two games. He was picked for the third game against Colombia and scored with a bending 30-yard free kick in a 2–0 victory, which was his first goal for England.\n\nIn the second round (last 16) of that competition, he received a red card in England's match against Argentina. Beckham, after having been fouled by Diego Simeone, kicked Simeone while lying on the floor, striking him on the calf muscle. \"Sports Illustrated\" was critical of the Argentinians' theatrics in that incident, stating that Simeone first delivered a \"heavy-handed challenge\" on Beckham and then \"fell like a ton of bricks\" when Beckham retaliated. Simeone later admitted to trying to get Beckham sent off by over-reacting to the kick and then, along with other members of his team, urging the referee to send Beckham off. The match finished in a draw and England were eliminated in a penalty shootout. Many supporters and journalists blamed him for England's elimination and he became the target of criticism and abuse, including the hanging of an effigy outside a London pub, and the \"Daily Mirror\" printing a dartboard with a picture of him centred on the bullseye. Beckham also received death threats after the World Cup.\n\nThe abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters peaked during England's 3–2 defeat by Portugal in Euro 2000, a match where Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him throughout the match. Beckham responded by raising his middle finger and, while the gesture attracted some criticism, many of the newspapers that had previously encouraged his vilification asked their readers to stop abusing him.\nOn 15 November 2000, following Kevin Keegan's resignation as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by the caretaker manager Peter Taylor, and then kept the role under new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson.\n\nBeckham played a major role in helping England qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in an impressive 5–1 victory over Germany in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to national hero happened in England's final qualifying game against Greece on 6 October 2001. England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2–1 with little time remaining. When Teddy Sheringham was fouled eight yards outside the Greek penalty area, England were awarded a free-kick and Beckham ensured England's qualification with a curling strike of the kind that had become his trademark. Beckham was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2001, and finished runner-up, to Luís Figo of Portugal, for the FIFA World Player of the Year award.\n\nBeckham was partially fit by the time of the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea, and played in the first match against Sweden. After the events of four years earlier, Beckham achieved a degree of revenge over Argentina by scoring the winning goal with a penalty, causing Argentina to fail to qualify for the knockout stage. England defeated Denmark in the second round with Beckham providing an assist in a 3–0 win. England were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Brazil after Ronaldinho scored the winner.\n\nThe following month, at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Beckham escorted Kirsty Howard as she presented the Jubilee Baton to the Queen. Beckham played in all of England's matches at Euro 2004. He had a penalty saved in England's 2–1 defeat to France and missed another in a penalty shootout in the quarter-final match against Portugal. England lost the shootout thus going out of the competition.\n\nBeckham became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in January 2005 and was involved in promoting London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games. In October 2005, Beckham's sending off against Austria made him the first England captain to be sent off and the first player to be sent off twice while playing for England. He captained England for the 50th time in a friendly international against Argentina the following month.\n\nIn England's opening game at the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an own-goal by Carlos Gamarra as England won 1–0. In England's next match, played against Trinidad and Tobago on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute led to a Peter Crouch goal, which put England into the lead 1–0. Beckham gave another assist to Steven Gerrard. In the end they won 2–0. He was named Man of the Match by tournament sponsor Budweiser.\n\nDuring England's second round match against Ecuador, Beckham scored from a free kick in the 59th minute, becoming the first English player to score in three separate World Cups, and giving England a 1–0 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England. In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3–1), the score having been 0–0 after extra time. After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not being able to play, being in tears at one point.\n\nA day after England were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement in a news conference that he had stepped down as England captain, stating, \"It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, having been captain for 58 of my 95 games, I feel the time is right to pass on the armband as we enter a new era under Steve McClaren.\" (Beckham had won 94 caps up to that point.) He was succeeded by Chelsea captain John Terry.\n\nHaving stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach Steve McClaren on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was \"looking to go in a different direction\" with the team, and that Beckham \"wasn't included within that.\" McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future. Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kieran Richardson, and the World Cup alternative to Beckham, Aaron Lennon, were all included, although McClaren eventually opted to employ Steven Gerrard in that role.\n\nOn 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against Brazil in England's first match at the new Wembley Stadium and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain John Terry. It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer Diego equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia, Beckham sent two trademark assists for Michael Owen and Peter Crouch, helping England to prevail 3–0. Beckham had assisted in three of England's four total goals in those two games, and he stated his desire to continue to play for England after his move to Major League Soccer.\n\nOn 22 August 2007, Beckham played in a friendly for England against Germany, becoming the first to play for England while with a non-European club team. On 21 November 2007, Beckham earned his 99th cap against Croatia, setting up a goal for Peter Crouch to tie the game at 2–2. Following the 2–3 loss, England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 Finals. Despite this, Beckham said that he has no plans to retire from international football and wanted to continue playing for the national team. After being passed over by new England coach and Beckham's former manager at Real Madrid, Fabio Capello, for a friendly against Switzerland which would have given him his hundredth cap; Beckham admitted that he was not in shape at the time, as he had not played a competitive match in three months.\n\nOn 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the England squad by Capello for the friendly against France in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long-term future in his side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup.\n\nOn 11 May 2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31-man England squad to face the United States at Wembley Stadium on 28 May before the away fixture with Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June. Beckham was honoured before the match by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from Bobby Charlton, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at half-time for David Bentley, the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision. In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match was the first time since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham. In two years, he had gone from being dropped completely from the England squad to being reinstated (though temporarily) as England captain.\n\nDuring the 2010 World Cup Qualifier against Belarus in which England won 3–1 in Minsk, Beckham came off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's third-most-capped player in history, overtaking Bobby Charlton in the process. On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with Bobby Moore's record of 108 caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for Stewart Downing in a friendly match against Spain. On 28 March 2009, Beckham surpassed Moore to hold the record outright when he came on as a substitute in a friendly against Slovakia, providing the assist for a goal from Wayne Rooney in the process. In all, Beckham had made 16 appearances out of a possible 20 for England under Capello until his ruptured Achilles tendon of March 2010 ruled him out of selection for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. His last game for England before injury had been on 14 October 2009 as a substitute in England's last World Cup qualifying game, which ended England 3 – 0 Belarus.\n\nAfter a poor performance from England at the World Cup, Capello remained as manager but was under pressure to revamp the England squad for the imminent UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign. He unveiled a new team at the next England match, a home friendly game against Hungary on 11 August 2010, with Beckham still unavailable for selection but aiming for a return to playing in MLS by the following month. In the post-match interview, Capello said of the prospect of the now 35-year-old Beckham playing any future competitive matches for England, that \"I need to change it. David is a fantastic player but I think we need new players for the future\", referring to the new players that play in Beckham's right midfield position, including Theo Walcott and Adam Johnson, adding \"This is the future of the team under Fabio Capello or another manager.\" He said that Beckham may be selected for one last friendly game, stating, \"If he is fit, I hope we will play one more game here at Wembley so the fans can say goodbye.\" In response to the comments, Beckham's agent released a statement reiterating Beckham's position that he had no desire to retire from international football, and would always make himself available for selection for England if fit and if needed. He remained 10 caps short of the record number of 125 caps by goalkeeper Peter Shilton, for a player of any position. Beckham was named in the provisional squad to represent the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Olympics. He was not included in the final selection by manager Stuart Pearce.\n\nBeckham was a product of Sir Alex Ferguson's hard-working approach at Manchester United, and was renowned for his long-range passing, crossing ability, and bending free-kicks as a right winger. Ferguson noted that Beckham \"practised with a discipline to achieve an accuracy that other players wouldn't care about.\" Beckham reportedly spent hours practising his free kicks after training sessions had ended.\nBeckham maintained his training routine at Real Madrid and even when his relationship with management was strained in early 2007, Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón and manager Fabio Capello praised Beckham for maintaining his professionalism and commitment to the club. Beckham's Real Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos regarded Beckham to be the best free-kick exponent he had ever seen. Two of the best free kick exponents of their generation, Roberto Carlos commented on the dilemma the team faced when they won a free kick on the edge of the penalty area: \"I would stand on one side and Beckham on the other but I wanted to see Beckham take the free-kick because it's beautiful how he hits the ball.\"\n\nIn May 2013, asked about how he wanted to be remembered in his retirement, Beckham said, \"I just want people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate about the game, someone that – every time I stepped on the pitch – I've given everything that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how I look back on it and hope people will see me.\"\n\nBeckham was the first England player ever to collect two red cards, and the first England captain to be sent off. Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 World Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying face down on the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.\n\nHe amassed 41 yellow cards and four red cards in his time at Real Madrid; all four reds came in La Liga. He received one red card while at Paris Saint-Germain, picked up in injury time in a match against Evian on 28 April 2013. Between 2000 and 2013, Beckham played 420 competitive games for England, Milan, LA Galaxy, Manchester United, Real Madrid and PSG, and received seven red cards, one every 60 matches on average.\n\nIn 2005, Beckham founded the David Beckham Academy football school, operating from two sites, in London and Los Angeles. It was announced in late 2009 that both would close. A mobile academy is being developed by Beckham, to travel around the UK and further afield.\n\nOn 5 February 2014, MLS announced that Beckham had exercised his option to buy a MLS expansion team for $25 million, which he had received as part of the contract he signed with the LA Galaxy in 2007. The ownership group, led by Beckham, originally hoped the Miami-based team would begin play in 2016 or 2017. After delays getting a stadium deal completed, MLS announced in January 2018 that the team had been approved and would likely begin play in 2020. The team name and crest were revealed on 5 September. Club Internacional de Futbol Miami – more commonly known as, Inter Miami – is represented by a black crest with neon pink trimmings and herons whose legs clasp to form an \"M\" for Miami.\n\nIn 1997, Beckham started dating Victoria Adams, after she attended a Manchester United match. She was famously known as \"Posh Spice\" of the pop music group Spice Girls, one of the world's top pop groups at the time, and his team was also enjoying a great run of success. Therefore, their relationship instantly attracted a great deal of media attention. The couple were dubbed \"Posh and Becks\" by the media. He proposed to her on 24 January 1998 in a restaurant in Cheshunt, England.\n\nOn 4 July 1999, they married at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland. Beckham's teammate Gary Neville was the best man, and the couple's infant son, Brooklyn, was the ring bearer. The media were kept away from the ceremony, as the Beckhams had an exclusive deal with \"OK! Magazine\", but newspapers were still able to obtain photographs showing them sitting on golden thrones. 437 staff were employed for the wedding reception, which was estimated to have cost £500,000.\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham have four children: sons Brooklyn Joseph (born 4 March 1999 at Portland Hospital, London), Romeo James (born 1 September 2002 at Portland Hospital, London), Cruz David (born 20 February 2005 at Ruber International Hospital, Madrid), and daughter Harper Seven (born 10 July 2011 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles). Elton John is godfather to Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham; their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley. Beckham's three sons have all played football in the Arsenal Academy. Like their father, Brooklyn and Romeo have both done modelling work and been named among GQ's best dressed British men. Brooklyn previously played football for Arsenal U16, but was released at the end of the 2014–15 season.\n\nIn his early Manchester United career, Beckham lived in a four-bedroom house in Worsley that he bought directly from the property developer as a 20-year-old in 1995. In 1999, shortly after his wedding he and Victoria bought a country house set in 24 acres in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, which the media nicknamed \"Beckingham Palace\".\n\nBeckham suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which he says makes him \"have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs.\" Victoria Beckham claims, \"If you open our fridge, it's all co-ordinated down either side. We've got three fridges – food in one, salad in another and drinks in the third. In the drinks one, everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans, he'll throw one away because it has to be an even number.\"\nIn April 2004, the British tabloid \"News of the World\" carried claims by Beckham's former personal assistant Rebecca Loos that he and Loos had an extramarital affair. A week later, the Malaysian-born Australian model Sarah Marbeck claimed that she had slept with Beckham on two occasions. Beckham dismissed both claims as \"ludicrous\".\n\nIn September 2010, Beckham announced that he was making a court application against prostitute Irma Nici and several others over claims in the magazine \"In Touch\" that he had sex with her. Although the magazine later accepted that the allegations against Beckham were untrue, his court application was dismissed under US freedom of speech laws.\n\nBeckham's fame extends beyond the pitch; in much of the world his name is \"as instantly recognisable as that of multinational companies like Coca-Cola and IBM.\" Beckham's relationship and marriage to Victoria, who has been famous in her own right as part of the Spice Girls, contributed to his celebrity beyond football.\n\nBeckham became known as a fashion icon, and together with Victoria, the couple became lucrative spokespeople sought after by clothing designers, health and fitness specialists, fashion magazines, perfume and cosmetics manufacturers, hair stylists, exercise promoters, and spa and recreation companies. One example is a line of aftershave and fragrances called David Beckham Instinct. In 2002, Beckham was hailed as the ultimate \"metrosexual\" by the man who invented the term and has been described as such by numerous other articles since.\n\nThe Beckhams were paid $13.7 million in 2007 to launch his fragrance line in the United States In the world of fashion, David has already appeared on the covers of many magazines. United States covers have included the men's magazine \"Details\", and with his wife for the August 2007 issue of \"W\". According to Google, \"David Beckham\" was searched for more than any other sports topic on their site in 2003 and 2004. According to Ask Jeeves, Beckham ranked third, after Britney Spears and Osama bin Laden, among subjects most searched for by British users of that site in the first decade of the 2000s.\nUpon their arrival in Los Angeles on 12 July 2007, the night before Beckham's formal introduction, Los Angeles International Airport was filled with paparazzi and news reporters. On the next night, Victoria appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jay Leno to talk about their move to LA, and presented Leno with a number 23 Galaxy jersey with his own name on the back. Victoria also talked about her NBC TV show \"\". On 22 July, a private welcoming party was held for the couple at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. A-list celebrities attending included Steven Spielberg, Jim Carrey, George Clooney, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nBeckham's many endorsement deals make him one of the most recognisable athletes throughout the world. Having worn Adidas football boots from the start of his career (notably Adidas Predator), in 2003 he signed a $160 million lifetime contract with Adidas, earning nearly half the money upfront, and will continue to earn percentages of profits on all of his branded Adidas products. He had a 10-year collaboration with Pepsi Co. that expired in 2009. He has also promoted The Walt Disney Company theme parks.\n\nBeckham has several eponymous video games, including \"Go! Go! Beckham! Adventure on Soccer Island\", a platform game for the Game Boy Advance, and \"David Beckham Soccer\", a football game for a number of platforms, and he was brand ambassador for exercise video game \"EA Sports Active 2\". Beckham featured in EA Sports' \"FIFA\" video game series; he was on the cover for the International edition of \"\". During his playing career (which ended in May 2013), Beckham generated an estimated £1 billion in shirt and boot sales. In 2006, Lloyd's of London insured his legs for £100m, at the time he was playing for Real Madrid. In March 2015 Beckham had the third highest social media rank in the world among sportspeople, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, with over 52 million Facebook fans.\n\nBeckham played a critical part in bringing the Olympics to London in 2012, travelling with the British delegation to Singapore in 2005 for the host city selection. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics closing ceremony, Beckham, Jimmy Page and Leona Lewis represented Britain during the handover segment for the 2012 Olympics. Beckham rode a London double-decker bus into the stadium and Page and Lewis performed \"Whole Lotta Love\". He also featured at the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, carrying the Olympic flame to the stadium by speedboat.\n\nBeckham visited Afghanistan in May 2010 for a morale-boosting visit to British troops fighting the Taliban insurgency. The appearance of Beckham as well as British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Defence Secretary Liam Fox was believed to have prompted a Taliban attack on Kandahar airfield.\n\nChinese authorities appointed Beckham as global ambassador for Chinese football in March 2013. After numerous officials had been banned for match-fixing, and the Chinese Super League had failed to retain the services of well-known international names, Beckham's role was to help improve the image of the game and raise its profile both in China and abroad.\n\nFrom 14 July 2013, Beckham started appearing in adverts for BSkyB advertising their Sky Sports coverage via the Sky Go app. In January 2014, Beckham appeared on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" on NBC in the U.S, and in March he made a guest appearance in the BBC's Sport Relief special of \"Only Fools and Horses\". He was named one of \"GQ\"s 50 best dressed British men in 2015.\n\nDuring the 2016 EU referendum, Beckham voiced his opposition to Brexit, stating “For our children and their children we should be facing the problems of the world together and not alone. For these reasons, I am voting to remain.”\n\nBeckham was announced as the new Ambassadorial president of the British Fashion Council on 11 May 2018. Prior to the June 2018 vote by FIFA member nations for selecting the hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Beckham endorsed the North American bid (Canada, Mexico and the United States).\n\nBeckham has supported UNICEF since his days at Manchester United and in January 2005, the English national team captain became a Goodwill Ambassador with a special focus on UNICEF's Sports for Development program. In 2012, he met with UK Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street to call for more action to help children affected by malnutrition around the world. In 2015, his tenth year as a UNICEF Ambassador, Beckham launched \"7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund\" to help protect children in danger. In June 2015 he visited Siem Reap in Cambodia, where he met with child victims of violence. Beckham has pledged his support for the Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS campaign. He is a former patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. In 2013, he also donated all his £3.4 million salary taken from Paris Saint-Germain to two children's charities in France. Beckham has been supporting the charity named Help For Heroes for many years whose aim is to help soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghan wars.\n\nOn 17 January 2007, Rebecca Johnstone, a 19-year-old cancer patient from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, received a surprise phone call from Beckham. After the conversation, he sent her a Real Madrid jersey with his signature on it. Rebecca died on 29 January 2007. On 1 July 2007, Beckham appeared as a speaker at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death. Proceeds from the concert went to Diana's charities as well as to charities of which her sons Princes William and Harry are patrons.\n\nBeckham is a founding member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with Andy Murray at Wembley Stadium. Beckham also appeared in a 2007 public service announcement for Malaria No More U.S, advertising the need for inexpensive bed nets. The TV spot aired in the United States on Fox Networks, including Fox Soccer Channel, and can also be seen on YouTube.\n\nSince joining Major League Soccer, Beckham has been a very public advocate in the United States for related charities such as \"MLS W.O.R.K.S.\" On 17 August 2007, he conducted a youth clinic in Harlem, along with other current and former MLS players. This was in advance of his first New York City area match the following day against the New York Red Bulls. That team's Jozy Altidore and Juan Pablo Ángel were also with Beckham, teaching skills to disadvantaged youth to benefit FC Harlem Lions.\n\nBeckham never personally appeared in the 2002 film \"Bend It Like Beckham\", except in archive footage. He and his wife wanted to make cameo appearances, but scheduling proved difficult, so the director used lookalike Andy Harmer instead.\n\nBeckham makes a cameo appearance with Zinedine Zidane and Raúl, in the 2005 film \"Goal!\". Harmer also doubled for him in the party scene. Beckham himself appears in the sequel \"\" in a larger role, when the film's lead character gets transferred to Real Madrid. This time, the story centres on the Real Madrid team, and besides Beckham, other real life Real Madrid players also appear on and off the pitch, alongside the fictional characters. Though the use of stock footage from the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Beckham appeared in \"\", which was released straight to DVD on 15 June 2009.\n\nBeckham has expressed no interest in pursuit of acting roles, saying he is too \"stiff\". However, due to his friendship with Guy Ritchie, he has made two cameo appearances in Ritchie's films: as a projectionist in \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" (based on the 1964 MGM television series of the same name), and as Trigger in \"\".\n\nBeckham has played along to jokes about his voice. In a 2018 promo for \"Deadpool 2\", Beckham is seen watching the first instalment of the film franchise in which Ryan Reynolds' character compares Beckham's voice to inhaling helium. Beckham is seen rolling his eyes at the voice jibe before receiving an apology text from Deadpool. Beckham answers his door to the antihero who presents him with milk and cookies, before Deadpool knocks again and has a bunch of helium-filled red balloons.\n\nBeckham captained England 59 times, the fourth highest after Bobby Moore and Billy Wright both with 90, and Bryan Robson with 65. With his free kick goal against Ecuador in the second round of the 2006 World Cup, Beckham gained membership into two of football's exclusive clubs: he became the only English player – and the 21st player in the world – to score in three World Cups; Real Madrid teammate Raúl also achieved this feat a few days earlier. It also made him only the fifth player in World Cup history to score twice from a direct free kick; the other four were Pelé, Roberto Rivelino, Teófilo Cubillas, and Bernard Genghini (Beckham had previously scored this way against Colombia in the first round of the 1998 World Cup). All three goals were against South American teams (Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador) and from set pieces (the two aforementioned free kicks and a penalty against Argentina).\n\n, Beckham had more than 50 tattoos. There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn, and of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed on his left forearm, is in Sanskrit script because Beckham thought it would be \"tacky\" to have it in English. However, this was misspelt as the equivalent of \"Vihctoria\". In his autobiography \"David Beckham: My Side\", he said that the idea of having tattoos came to him in 1999 after his son Brooklyn was born, following a conversation on the subject of tattoos with Mel B and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar. Beckham said: \"When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me.\" In 2018, Beckham added to his collection with a tattoo of a solar system covering the left side of his scalp.\n\nManchester United Youth\n\nManchester United\n\nReal Madrid\n\nLA Galaxy\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2475199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2475199", "title": "David Platt (Coronation Street)", "text": "David Platt (Coronation Street)\n\nDavid Platt (also Tilsley) is a fictional character from the British soap opera, \"Coronation Street\". He was born on-screen during the episode broadcast on 25 December 1990. He was played by Thomas Ormson from his first appearance until 15 March 2000 when Ormson left. Jack P. Shepherd took over the role and made his first on screen appearance on 26 April 2000.\n\nDavid is the son of Martin (Sean Wilson) and Gail Platt (Helen Worth). David was born on Christmas Day 1990. Martin's friend Carmel Finnan (Catherine Cusack) tried to kidnap David when he was a toddler. She also posed as his mother to other characters. Carmel then tries to frame Gail for pushing her down the stairs and is revealed to be mentally ill. In 2000, a nine-year-old David becomes jealous of the attention being paid to his newborn niece Bethany Platt (Amy and Emily Walton). He decides to gain attention by getting arrested for shoplifting. In 2001, Gail and Martin divorce after Martin has an affair with Rebecca Hopkins (Jill Halfpenny). David is unhappy and begins misbehaving in the hope that they will get back together. David becomes the target of a school bully and, despite Gail's advice to ignore the bully, he becomes violent and gets into fights. His behaviour worsens when Gail marries Richard Hillman (Brian Capron) in July 2002, but he comes to accept Richard. In March 2003, Richard is revealed to be a serial killer, and tries to kill himself, Gail, David, Bethany, and her mother - David's sister - Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) by driving them into the local canal. Gail, Sarah, David and Bethany are all rescued, while Richard drowns. In the years following, David develops a penchant for lying and scheming at home and at school.\n\nHe is unhappy with Gail's relationship with Phil Nail (Clive Russell) and begins a hate campaign against Phil. David does not trust Phil, as a result of Richard's behaviour. Phil reaches breaking point with David and throws him up against a wall, threatening to beat him up. David tells Gail, but Phil lies to her, and Gail believes him and slaps David, unaware that he is telling the truth. Gail receives a card addressed from Richard. She suspects Phil of sending the cards. Realising David is behind the scam, Phil throws David across the table in front of Gail. An angry Gail ends their relationship. The Platt family still receive cards from Richard, and Gail realises David is the culprit. Gail blames herself for David's behaviour. In December 2006, David discovers Sarah's grandmother Ivy Tilsley's (Lynne Perrie) diary and reads it, and is shocked that Gail had wanted to abort him, but he understands this after Gail told him that Ivy had been having a rough time since the death of her son and Gail's husband, Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten). He develops romantic feelings for Maria Sutherland (Samia Smith), but is annoyed she is enjoying an affair with Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). Charlie threatens David into silence. David tries to blackmail Charlie, who tries drowning David in a bath to rid of him, but Maria walks in and saves him. In January 2007, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) murders Charlie, staging it to look like self-defence. David offers to testify for Tracy that he saw Charlie attack her, on the condition that she sleeps with him. Tracy agrees, but the prosecution proves David's testimony to be lies.\n\nIn January 2008, David begins a relationship with Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) and she becomes pregnant. In March 2008, Gail pays for an abortion and they decide not to tell David. He finds out and, in an argument, he pushes Gail down the stairs. He persuades Tina to give him an alibi, but she ends their romance. David smashes various vehicles and windows on the Street, attacks Ken Barlow (William Roache) and hits a policewoman. He is sentenced to four months in a Young Offenders Institution. When he is released Tina reconciles with him, but faces more issues when a jealous David reads her emails. He dates Amber Kalirai (Nikki Patel) in an attempt to make Tina jealous, which has the desired effect and they get back together.\n\nIn November 2008, David feuds with the Windass family when they refuse to pay for work Tina's father Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale) has carried out. David threatens Eddie (Steve Huison) and Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) with a crowbar. Len (Conor Ryan) and Gary Windass (Mikey North) steal Joe's work tools in retaliation. David then destroys their kitchen, so the Windass family remove the kitchen from the house. Gail and Anna are forced to call a truce to avoid more problems. David spends time away from Weatherfield when Tina wants nothing more to do with him. Upon his return he becomes jealous of Tina and Gary's friendship. David frames Gary for theft and also tricks him into buying stolen goods. He then enlists Gary to commit robbery, which goes wrong when Gail's father Ted Page (Michael Byrne), interrupts them, calls the police and has a heart attack. Gary decides to confess to the police, which leads to David being arrested. David becomes jealous when Tina begins a relationship with Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). David discovers that Joe is addicted to prescription medication and agrees to supply him with drugs as long as he tries to break Tina and Jason up. In February 2010, Joe commits suicide, but the police presume he has been murdered and arrest Gail. David has to scheme in order to prove Gail's innocence. In late 2010, Tina begins a relationship with Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey). This upsets David and he feels betrayed. David suffers a black-out while driving and knocks Graeme over. No one believes David's versions of events and the police arrest him for attempted murder. Before the court case is about to begin David passes out again and everyone begins to realise he was telling the truth. He is found to be suffering from epilepsy.\n\nDavid returns from a holiday engaged to Kylie Turner (Paula Lane). Gail is angry and tries to convince David to change his mind. David and Kylie then get married in April 2011. David fights to take custody of Kylie's son Max Turner (Harry McDermott), but ends up feuding with her sister Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly), with Kylie trying to avoid it. David insists that Steve and Becky aren't fit to look after Max, proving this when he saves Max from being run over. David has to deal with Gail and Kylie feuding. But when he learns that Gail has tried to bribe Kylie to leave, he threatens to leave home. Kylie gets a job at the salon with David. He is upset when Max is put up for adoption and she does not want to prevent this. He convinces her they must change their ways and convince social services to allow Max to live with them.\n\nIn August 2013, David discovers that Kylie has slept with Nick but does not confront them. He vandalises Nick's flat and writes poison pen letters to his wife Leanne. Nick tells David he knows he is behind the trouble and suggests they discuss it with Kylie. To prevent Kylie from finding out David causes a car accident. Nick is left in a coma which results in permanent brain damage. David learns he is Lily's biological father, but when Kylie discovers his acts of revenge she throws him out. Following their reconciliation, Max is diagnosed with ADHD in August 2014 and Kylie becomes addicted to his medication. David restricts Kylie's access to the medication, but she compensates with an amphetamine addiction. He throws Kylie out and she leaves Weatherfield on Christmas Day 2014.\n\nIn January 2015, Max's father Callum Logan (Sean Ward) arrives and wants access to Max. When David refuses Callum starts a custody battle, which begins a violent feud. Kylie returns in May 2015 and helps strengthen David's claim to Max. Their feud escalates, and he manipulates Sarah and Bethany (now played by Lucy Fallon). When they try to frame Callum for a crime in September 2015, he attacks Sarah and Kylie kills Callum to protect her. David decides to help cover the murder up and buries the body down a man hole in their home. When a car crash occurs in May 2016, rescue workers find Callum's body. David is initially the main suspect, but they frame the recently deceased Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), Jason's father, another of Callum's enemies, who happens to be dead. In July 2016, Kylie decides she cannot live in the house Callum died in any longer. David agrees to relocate their family to Barbados. Their plans are ruined when Clayton Hibbs (Callum Harrison) stabs Kylie in the street and she dies in David's arms. David then attacks Clayton who is then charged with Kylie's murder. Gail is concerned about David and his calm attitude towards planning Kylie's funeral.\n\nIn October 2016, David wants revenge for Kylie's murder, believing their will be no justice for Kylie. He publicly names Clayton, despite Clayton being aged under 18, as Kylie's killer and attempts to kill Macca Hibbs, Clayton's step-brother, whilst he's in hospital. David plans his final act of revenge on Clayton by crashing his new car into the police van Clayton is in whilst igniting a large amount of petrol to blow them both up. After he makes a suicide video, Gail, Nick and Sarah see it and lock David in the Bistro cellar until the trial is over. After tricking Gail into thinking that he has committed suicide, David escapes the Bistro, gets into his car that is covered in petrol and drives off. However, as he speeds along, David spots Lily on the road and swerves to avoid her, but ends up flipping the car, which lands on Lily and Gary (who had attempted to get Lily to safety). Some of the residents are able to get Gary and Lily out as David manages to get out of the car. However, a spark causes the car to catch fire and cause an explosion, setting Anna on fire and badly injuring her, whilst David looks on in horror. Sarah admits to Gary, who she is in a relationship with, what David did, but Sarah persuades him not to tell anyone for the sake of Max and Lily. David inherits £20,000 from a client who dies, as well as a dog. Gary finds out from Sarah about the money, so David gives Anna and Kevin £19,000. In 2017, he begins a relationship with an older woman called Shona Ramsey (Julia Goulding), not knowing that she is Clayton's estranged mother. \n\nIn March 2018, David is drugged and raped by his new friend Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton) following a night out. He is left ashamed and embarrassed. He then goes to visit Martin, who is moving to New Zealand, in Liverpool with Max and Lily. Martin, sensing something is wrong with David, goes back to Weatherfield to speak to him. Following the rape David starts lashing out at everyone, worrying Shona, Gail, Martin, Sarah, Gary, Bethany and Audrey as well as many other residents. He takes Tyrone's place in the charity boxing event, his opponent is Gary when they fight, David has flashbacks and he brutally attacks Gary while everyone watches in horror. This leaves Gary fighting for his life, Sarah doesn't believe her own brother would do such a thing. But what no one knows but David himself is he's still suffering mentally and emotionally from when Josh drugged and raped him, this leads to him breaking up with Shona, saying he doesn't love her anymore. This leads to her moving out and moving in with Roy Cropper (David Neilson) at Roy's rolls. He later starts a relationship with Emma Brooker (Alexandra Mardell) who is a year older than Bethany. On the day of his trial for attacking Gary, he runs off while his solicitor Imran Habeeb (Charlie De Melo) is distracted. Shona finds him and he reveals his rape to her after finding out about Aidan Connor's (Shayne Ward) suicide. They get back together and Shona promises to stay by his side. David later tells Gail and Audrey about the rape while Gail tells Sarah. While doing community service for beating up Gary, he and another man make homophobic jokes towards gay vicar Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank). When Billy later asks him to apologize, David refuses and Billy locks the door. David breaks down and admits to Billy that he was raped. Billy later follows David when he follows Josh and a potential victim. Billy tells him to go home and to do nothing. Billy later contridicts himself and warns the man of Josh. Josh gets beaten up by this man and ends up in hospital. He becomes blind and Billy regularly visits him out of guilt. Billy then let’s Josh live with him. David and Shona find out and are disgusted with Billy. He is also furious when he finds out that Bethany knew about Billy visiting Josh in hospital. After Josh re evaluates his behaviour, he visits David in the salon, however he still won't admit to raping him. David kidnaps him and tricks him into thinking they are outside a police station. When Josh breaks down and pleads that his life would be hell in prison, David gets closure and tells Josh that they are in an alleyway, before leaving him stranded.\n\nIn August 2017, Shepherd was longlisted for \"Best Actor\" and \"Funniest Male\" at the \"Inside Soap Awards\". He did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. On 2 June 2018, Shepherd was awarded his first \"Best Actor\" accolade at The British Soap Awards 2018, following his performances during the rape storyline. In July 2018, Shepherd was longlisted for \"Best Actor\" and \"Best Partnership\", alongside Julia Goulding who plays Shona Ramsey, at the \"Inside Soap\" Awards. For his portrayal of David, Shepherd was nominated for Best Soap Actor (Male) at the 2018 \"Digital Spy\" Reader Awards. David's male rape storyline was also nominated in the \"Best Soap Storyline\" category, while David and Shona's partnership was nominated in the \"Best Soap Couple\" category.\n\nFearing real-life imitation of the scene in which David was tortured by Charlie Stubbs, many formal complaints were filed by viewers with the Government’s Office of Communications. In the end, \"\"Coronation Street\" was cleared by TV watchdogs after 31 complaints about scenes of 'bullying and torture'\". Investigators eventually ruled that the torture scenes \"were editorially justified by plot development, characters involved and the manner of editing.\"\n\nTony Stewart of the \"Daily Mirror\" refers to the character as \"David Pratt\" when writing reviews of any storyline he features in, due to the character's way of seemingly always getting away with outlandish things. In magazine articles he is often referred to as \"Demon David\", \"Teen Tormenter\" or \"Psycho Platt\".\n\n"}

A native of Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico, she rose to prominence during the Mexican Revolution as a Socialist activist and reformer and as a supporter and associate of General Emiliano Zapata.\n\nDolores Jiménez y Muro was born June 7, 1848, in Aguascalientes, Mexico, but while young her family moved San Luis Potosí. She grew up in the upper middle class of San Luis Potosí, where her father was a senior government official. The family had many liberal friends and from her childhood Jiménez was exposed to foreign and liberal ideas. She had no formal schooling, studying at home, but was encouraged to pursue her talent for poetry. In 1874, she was invited by the state government to read her poems at an official celebration of the September independence festivals. These poems were later collected into a book and published as \"Un rayo de luz\" (A Ray of Light). In 1883 Jiménez lost both of her parents and she began teaching school. She became aware of how easily one could fall into poverty or become exploited.\n\nDolores Jiménez published in La Esmeralda and La Sombra de Zaragoza and by 1902 had become the director of La Potosina Magazine. She continued to teach in the rural school system until 1904, when she moved to Mexico City. She published articles against the regime of Porfirio Díaz and was arrested. In prison, she met Elisa Acuña Rossetti, Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza, and Inés Malváez. From prison, the woman began publishing a radical journal, \"Fiat Lux\". In 1905, she joined the staff of the \"La Mujer Mexicana\" (Mexican Women) for whom she worked until 1908. She also published articles in \"Diario del Hogar\" (Newspaper of the Home).\n\nIn 1907, Acuña, Belén and Jiménez y Muro founded the \"Daughters of Anahuac\", a group of about three hundred libertarian women, who demanded improved working conditions for women and advocated labor strikes. In 1908, Jiménez founded, with Acuña, Belén, and Jose Edilberto Pinelo, a worker's organization in Mexico City called \"Mexican Socialism.\" They continued to publish the newspaper \"Fiat Lux\", as the voice of an organization called the Mutual Society for Women. In 1910, Jiménez and others founded the Club Femenil Antirreeleccionista Hijas de Cuauhtémoc (Anti-Reelectionist Women's Club: Daughters of Cuauhtémoc). The club, including members Mercedes Arvides and Julia Nava de Ruisánchez staged a demonstration in Mexico City on 11 September 1910 protesting election fraud. These activities and a failed attempt at rebellion by supporters of Arriaga resulted in the arrest of Jiménez, Acuña, Belén, and María Dolores Malváes and their imprisonment at San Juan de Ulúa fortress in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn prison in 1911, Dolores Jiménez continued to be politically active in jail and founded \"Regeneración y Concordia\". Through this she sought to further the changes that she desired to see in Mexico. She envisioned a country where there were significant improvements to the economy and land reforms. She also wanted changes to improve the living conditions of women and indigenous people. \"Regeneración y Concordia\" had feminist aims which her partners, Acuña, Belén and Sara Estela Ramírez joined her work.\n\nIn March, 1911, Francisco I. Madero called for demonstrations in Guerrero, Michoacan, Tlaxcala, Puebla and Campeche, and Jiménez organized the protests. She was a notable contributor to the Complot de Tacubaya, which sought to depose President Porfirio Díaz in favor of Francisco I. Madero. She is credited with writing \"The Political and Social Plan\", published on March 18, 1911, which outlined the ideas and aims of the conspirators. The \"Plan\" advocated a continuation of the demands the Mexican Liberal Party had made in 1906, including fair wages, affordable housing, improved working conditions, and curbs on foreign investment. It also promoted the decentralization of the country's education system, on the premise that a school's needs are best met when it is locally funded and controlled. Unlike earlier revolutionary theorists, however, Jiménez insisted that wage should be increased for women as well as for men. She also insisted that foreign firms operating in Mexico should be required to have at least half of their workforce made up of Mexicans.\n\nAfter the plan was read in Mexico City on 31 October 1911, interim president Francisco León de la Barra had Jiménez arrested. In spite of her age, (she was in her 60s and most of her compatriot revolutionaries were in their 20s), she was refused release until she staged a hunger strike. She realized that Madero was not a supporter of the radical reforms she supported and switched her loyalty to Emiliano Zapata. In 1913, she joined the Zapatista forces and developed the prologue to the Plan de Ayala. She directed the newspaper \"La voz de Juárez\" from which denounced the coup led by Victoriano Huerta to overthrow Madero. Zapata appointed her to a position of brigadier general but that was insufficient to prevent an eleven-month imprisonment ordered in 1914 by Huerta. She was released from prison and rejoined Zapata until his assassination in 1919.\n\nBetween 1921 and 1924, Jiménez worked in the Secretary of Education's Cultural Missions program.\n\nShe died on October 15, 1925, in Mexico City, at the age of 77.\n\n\n"}

The emperor Marcus Aurelius was her nephew and later became her adopted son, along with Emperor Lucius Verus. She died early in the principate of Antoninus Pius, but continued to be prominently commemorated as a \"diva\", posthumously playing a prominent symbolic role during his reign.\n\nFaustina was the only known daughter of consul and prefect Marcus Annius Verus and Rupilia Faustina. Her brothers were consul Marcus Annius Libo and praetor Marcus Annius Verus. Her maternal aunts were Roman Empress Vibia Sabina and Matidia Minor. Her paternal grandfather was named Marcus Annius Verus, like her father, while her maternal grandparents were Salonia Matidia (niece of Roman Emperor Trajan) and suffect consul Lucius Scribonius Libo Rupilius Frugi Bonus. Faustina was born and raised in Rome.\n\nWhile a private citizen, she married Antoninus Pius between 110 and 115 CE. Faustina bore Antoninus four children: two sons and two daughters. These were:\n\nAccording to the unreliable \"Historia Augusta\", there were rumours while Antoninus was proconsul of Asia that Faustina conducted herself with \"excessive frankness and levity\".\n\nOn July 10, 138, her uncle, the emperor Hadrian, died and her husband became the new emperor, as Antoninus was Hadrian's adopted son and heir. Faustina became Roman Empress and the Senate accorded her the title of \"Augusta\". As empress, Faustina was well respected and was renowned for her beauty and wisdom. Throughout her life, as a private citizen and as empress, Faustina was involved in assisting charities for the poor and sponsoring and assisting in the education of Roman children, particularly girls. A letter between Fronto and Antoninus Pius has sometimes been taken as an index of the latter's devotion to her.\n\nAfter Antoninus Pius' accession to the principate, the couple never left Italy; instead, they divided their time between Rome, Antoninus' favourite estate at Lorium, and other properties at Lanuvium, Tusculum, and Signia.\n\nFaustina's personal style was evidently much admired and emulated. Her distinctive hairstyle, consisting of braids pulled back in a bun behind or on top of her head, was imitated for two or three generations in the Roman world.\n\nSeveral provincial groups chose to honour her while she was empress: a company of couriers in Ephesus named themselves after her, while a company of clapper-players in Puteoli dedicated an altar to her in her own lifetime.\n\nFaustina died near Rome in 140, perhaps at Antoninus Pius' estate at Lorium. Antoninus was devastated at Faustina's death and took several steps to honor her memory. He had the Senate deify her (her \"apotheosis\" was portrayed on an honorary column) and dedicate the Temple of Faustina to her in the Roman Forum. The Senate authorized gold and silver statues of her, including an image to appear in the circus, where it might be displayed in a \"carpentum\" (a kind of covered waggon) or \"currus elephantorum\" (a cart drawn by elephants). Antoninus also ordered various coins with her portrait struck, inscribed (\"Divine Faustina\") and elaborately decorated. He also established a charity called \"Puellae Faustinianae\" (\"Girls of Faustina\") to assist orphaned Roman girls and created a new \"alimenta\" (see Grain supply to the city of Rome). Her remains were interred in the Mausoleum of Hadrian. Certain cities struck coin issues in honour of the \"divine Faustina\" (); the most notable such cities were Delphi, Alexandria, Bostra, and Nicopolis. Martin Beckmann suggests that the coins of Nicopolis might have been minted at Rome and given out as imperial largesse at the Actian Games. The coins issued in the wake of Faustina's funeral illustrate her elaborate funeral pyre, which may have influenced the design of later private mausolea; the deities Pietas and Aeternitas, among others; and an eagle (or less often a winged genius) bearing a figure aloft, with the legend (i.e. Faustina's ascension into heaven). Coins of Faustina were sometimes incorporated into jewellery and worn as amulets.\n\nThe posthumous cult of Faustina was exceptionally widespread, and Faustina's image continued to be omnipresent throughout Antoninus Pius' principate. A colossal marble head, believed to be that of Faustina and discovered in 2008, figured as one of several monumental imperial statues at the ancient site of Sagalassos in today's Turkey. In Olympia, Herodes Atticus dedicated a nymphaeum that displayed statues of Faustina and other Antonines as well as his own ancestors. Faustina also appears on the at Ephesus commemorating members of the imperial family. Bergmann and Watson have characterized the commemoration of Faustina as central to Antoninus Pius' political persona. One larger-than-life statue, discovered \"in situ\" near the Termini railway station at Rome, appears to depict Faustina as Concordia, with a patera and cornucopia; it would have been displayed alongside statues of Diana Lucifera and Apollo-Sol in baths privately owned but available to the public.\n\nAntoninus and Faustina were officially held up as such exemplars of conjugal harmony that newlyweds were directed to pray at an altar of Antoninus and Faustina that they might live up to their example. This was evidently the case in Ostia, and probably so in Rome.\n\nThe Temple of Faustina is thought to have been dedicated in 144 CE. It is a grand hexastyle structure with Corinthian columns, possibly designed originally to be a temple of Ceres. Depictions on coins appear to show a cult image of Faustina seated on a throne and holding a tall staff in her left hand. Faustina's portrait on coins from this period is often crowned as well as veiled, which may also recall a feature of Faustina's cult image from the temple. \nThe deified Faustina was associated particularly closely with Ceres, who featured prominently on coins of Faustina; for some years, the torch-bearing Ceres was the dominant motif in her gold coinage. Herodes Atticus venerated Faustina as the “new Demeter” (the Greek equivalent of Ceres) at a private sanctuary he established outside Rome, now the church of Sant'Urbano. In addition to Ceres, Vesta and Juno feature prominently in Faustina's coinage. She was also associated with the Magna Mater and at Cyrene with Isis; at Sardis she was worshipped conjointly with Artemis. \n\nTen years after Faustina's death, a new commemorative coinage was introduced, featuring the legend Aeternitas ('eternity'); such coins may have been introduced to be distributed at a public ceremony in her memory.\n\nAfter Antoninus Pius' death, his adoptive sons and successors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus erected the Column of Antoninus Pius, which dramatically depicted Antoninus and Faustina being elevated heavenward together on the back of a winged figure.\n\nFaustina continued to be commemorated in certain Renaissance depictions as a “model wife”.\n\n"}

Finns emigrated to the United Kingdom, The United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Germany, Israel and Brazil.\n\nThe years between 1870 and 1930 are sometimes referred as 'the Great Migration' of Finns into North America. In the 1870s, there were only 3,000 migrants from Finland, but this figure was rapidly growing. New migrants often sent letters home, describing their life in the New World, and this encouraged more and more people to leave and try their luck in America. Rumors began of the acres of land that could be cleared into vast productive fields and the opportunity to earn \"a barrel of American dollars\" in mines, factories, and railroads. There were also professional recruiters, or 'agents', employed by mining and shipping companies, who encouraged Finns to move to the United States. This activity was frowned upon by the authorities of the Grand Duchy, and was mostly done in secret. It was eventually brought to an end in the late 1880s by legislation in the United States, but the decade still saw a 12-fold increase in the number of Finnish migrants compared to the previous decade, as 36,000 Finns left their home country for North America.\n"}

Underwood is a fictional character and the protagonist of the American adaptation of \"House of Cards\", portrayed by Kevin Spacey. He is depicted as a ruthless politician who rises from House Majority Whip to President of the United States through treachery, deception and murder. He is based on Francis Urquhart, the protagonist of the British novel and television series \"House of Cards\", from which the American Netflix series is drawn. He is married to Claire Underwood (Robin Wright), but also had a sexual relationship with Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) in season 1. He made his first appearance in the series' pilot episode, \"Chapter 1\".\n\nUnderwood is from Gaffney, South Carolina. He graduated from The Sentinel (a fictionalized version of The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina) in 1981 and, subsequently, Harvard Law School in 1984. Some of Underwood's dialogue throughout the series is presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique that breaks the fourth wall. The character speaks with a Southern accent. During season 1, he is the Democratic Majority Whip in the United States House of Representatives. In season 2, he is the newly appointed Vice President of the United States, before becoming President of the United States in the season finale.\n\nUnderwood has been described as conniving, Machiavellian, sociopathic, and a symbol of political corruption. Throughout the series, he manipulates and destroys several people, including those he calls friends, for his own ends. Among other crimes, he personally commits murder twice, signs off on another murder committed by a subordinate, orders the deaths of two former employees, critically injures a member of his cabinet to prevent her testifying against him, and indirectly allows the murder of a civilian for political ends.\n\nSpacey has received positive reviews for his portrayal of Frank Underwood, but the character itself has been criticized for its repetitive nature and one-dimensionality. Spacey was one of the first three actors playing leading roles in web-television series to be nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Spacey has also been nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, winning one, and five Screen Actors Guild Awards, including two cast nominations and including two wins, for his performance.\n\nOn November 3, 2017, following sexual assault claims made against Spacey, Netflix cut ties with the actor, putting the character's fate in question. In a teaser trailer for the sixth season of \"House of Cards\", it is shown that Underwood died in 2017 and is now buried next to his father in South Carolina.\n\nFrancis J. Underwood was born on November 5, 1959, to Catherine and Calvin T. Underwood in Gaffney, South Carolina. He is an only child. He was raised in impoverished circumstances, with the threat of bank foreclosure on the farm they lived on. He entered The Sentinel, a military school in Charleston, South Carolina, loosely based on The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, in the fall of 1976. He graduated in 1981 and, despite having made poor grades, gained admittance into Harvard Law School. He received his J.D. degree from there in 1984. While at the Sentinel, he had a homosexual relationship with his roommate, Tim Corbet (David Andrews), which lasted until his first year of law school. Underwood was raised Christian, but holds God in complete contempt.\n\nUnderwood's great-great-great-grandfather, Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood, was a Confederate soldier who served in the 12th South Carolina Infantry Regiment of McGowan's Brigade at the Battle of Spotsylvania. He served at the Bloody Angle on May 12, 1864, during the Civil War and was killed by a bludgeon to the back of the head from his own regiment during the middle of the night. Underwood is fascinated by his ancestry. When Underwood falls into a coma following an assassination attempt, Augustus appears in several of his hallucinations. However, he dismisses the Confederacy as weak and calls their cause of preserving the institution of slavery \"asinine\". His great-great grandfather was two when Augustus was killed.\n\nHis father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach farmer in his home town of Gaffney who died at the age of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.\n\nUnderwood was elected at the age of 25 to the South Carolina State Senate as one of the youngest members in the state's legislative history after graduating from Harvard in 1984. He was re-elected to the state senate at 29 in 1988 for his second, and last, term as a State Senator.\n\nUnderwood was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990 as a Democratic representative for the 5th Congressional District of South Carolina, being sworn in during January 1991. He won another 11 consecutive elections, winning his final term in 2012. He was elected Whip for the Democratic Party in 2005, serving as House Majority Whip between 2005 and 2013.\n\nUnderwood is utterly ruthless and Machiavellian, and is willing to commit any crime, including murder, to further his goal of attaining power. Many critics have described him as a sociopath and as \"pure evil\".\n\nOften, Underwood's thoughts throughout the series are presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique known as breaking the fourth wall. Immediately prior to starring in \"House of Cards\", Spacey had starred in a production of William Shakespeare's \"Richard III\" as Richard III of England, a character that serves as a partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood. His last name is derived from Oscar Underwood, who served as the first Democratic House Minority Whip from about 1900 to 1901. His few vices include smoking cigarettes and playing video games; when the Secret Service cuts off his online gaming service after he becomes Vice President, he takes up creating model figurines.\n\nSpacey viewed portraying Underwood for a second season as a continuing learning process. \"There is so much I don't know about Francis, so much that I'm learning... I've always thought that the profession closest to that of an actor is being a detective... We are given clues by writers... Then you lay them all out and try to make them come alive as a character who's complex and surprising, maybe even to yourself.\"\n\nAccording to \"Time\" television critic James Poniewozik, by the end of the first episode, it becomes clear that Underwood both literally and figuratively uses meat as his metaphor of choice. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because \"I'm feelin' hungry today!\", and he depicts his life with meat metaphors. For example, he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: \"She's as tough as a two-dollar steak\" and plans to destroy an enemy the way \"you devour a whale. One bite at a time\". He also endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, as he tells the audience, by \"[imagining] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet.\"\n\nTim Goodman of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" notes that, in Season 2, with Underwood's new position as Vice President, \"He's got more power now and that means he instills more fear in his enemies\". At one point during the season, he states \"The road to power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties. I need to prove what the vice president is capable of.\" Underwood and Claire \"continue their ruthless rise to power as threats mount on all fronts.\"\n\nUnderwood's sexuality is ambiguous throughout much of the first two seasons; he has sexual liaisons with both men and women, but he is never explicitly identified by any sexual label. Before Season 2, various sources speculated about his homosexuality. It is revealed in \"Chapter 8\" he had an experience with homosexuality in college. Underwood and Claire are never depicted having sex in season 1. \"Slate\" journalist Hanna Rosin noted: if Frank and Claire Underwood were a real-life Washington couple and they were found each to be having an affair, he would be accused of being \"secretly gay, turned on by women only when he can use them for a pure power play\". Other sources make no definite stance on Underwood's sexuality, but hypothesize that he is not sexually attracted to Claire. In season 2, Underwood is involved in a threesome with Claire and Secret Service agent Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), while in season 3, there is a moment of sexual tension between Underwood and his biographer, Tom Yates (Paul Sparks). The same season, however, also features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have sex exclusively with each other. In season five, he has sex with Eric Rawlings (Malcolm Madera), his male personal trainer.\n\nStelter described Frank and Claire Underwood as a \"scheming\" couple. Michael Dobbs, the author of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood says, \"I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood.\" While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power. Hank Stuever of \"The Washington Post\" describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, \"My husband doesn't apologize... even to me.\" Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says \"The Underwoods have proven themselves almost robotic in their pursuit of power.\" Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series \"...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good.\" Willimon notes that \"What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules than the rest of us typically do.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" critic Mary McNamara makes the case that \"House of Cards\" is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.\n\nUnderwood and Claire engage in a threesome with their Secret Service bodyguard Edward Meechum at one point in season 2, but have otherwise largely given up intramarital and extramarital sex in favor of their pursuit of power. \"International Business Times\" critic Ellen Killoran notes that this may relate back to Underwood's quotation of Oscar Wilde to Zoe Barnes in Season 1: \"A great man once said, 'everything is about sex \"except\" sex. Sex is about \"power\".'\" Avoiding sex may retain the balance of power in their relationship. His relationship with Claire is the epicenter of season 2.\n\nUnderwood develops an intimate relationship with \"Washington Herald\" and \"Slugline\" reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), with Claire's knowledge. As the show begins, Barnes is desperate to rise from covering the Fairfax County Council beat to covering what's going on \"behind the veil of power in the Capitol hallways.\" By the end of the first episode, Barnes is among the cadre of Underwood's accomplices. They begin a relationship, with Barnes promising to earn his trust and not \"ask any questions\" in return for his supplying her with sensitive political information. Toward the end of Season 1, she ends their personal relationship and begins investigating his connection to Congressman Peter Russo's apparent suicide (Underwood had in fact killed him by flooding his car with carbon monoxide while the Congressman was passed out drunk). Underwood ultimately kills Barnes in the season 2 premiere, by pushing her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train after she begins to follow clues related to the murder.\n\nUnderwood is fond of the head of his Secret Service detail, Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), and it is hinted several times that they harbor unacknowledged sexual feelings for each other. When Meechum stumbles upon Underwood watching pornography, Underwood and Claire joke about there being sexual chemistry between the two men. Shortly after Underwood becomes vice president, he, Claire and Meechum have a threesome.\n\nMeechum remains Underwood's bodyguard once he becomes the president, and there does not appear to be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.\n\nWhen Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood during a campaign event, Meechum trades fire with the would-be assassin, and both die at the scene. Meechum's death is one of the tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in Arlington National Cemetery, a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent. When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has been painted over, he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire, who says that Meechum was one of the few people who truly understood them.\n\nUnderwood is an Americanized version of the original BBC series lead character Francis Urquhart, a Machiavellian post-Margaret Thatcher Chief Whip of the Conservative Party. Urquhart employs deceit, cunning, murder, and blackmail to influence and pursue the office of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. According to series producer Beau Willimon, the change in last name stemmed from the \"Dickensian\" feeling and \"more legitimately American\" sounding resonance of the name 'Underwood'. Whereas Urquhart is an aristocrat by birth, Underwood is a self-made man, having been born into a poor Southern family with an alcoholic father. Urquhart was one of television's first antiheroes, whereas Underwood follows the more recent rash of antiheroes that includes Tony Soprano of \"The Sopranos\", Walter White of \"Breaking Bad\", and Dexter Morgan of \"Dexter\". However, unlike most other antiheroes, Underwood is not forced into immorality either by circumstance (White), birth (Soprano) or upbringing (Morgan). In his review of Season 2, \"Slant Magazine\"s Alan Jones writes that Underwood is evil by choice. Although the character is based on the BBC show's lead character, in interviews during the writing and filming of season 2, creator and showrunner Willimon said that he used Lyndon B. Johnson as a source of themes and issues addressed in \"House of Cards\". Unlike the center-right Urquhart, who leads the Conservative Party, the center-left Underwood is a member of the Democratic Party, but cares little for ideology in favor of \"ruthless pragmatism\" in furthering his own political influence and power.\n\nSpacey summed up Underwood's relationship with the viewer - i.e. whenever he breaks the fourth wall - as being like that of a \"best friend\" and \"the person [he trusts] more than anyone.\" Because of this, his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood's true feelings and intentions - typically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises. In the season 2 premiere, after having gone the whole episode without doing so, Underwood addresses the viewer directly, saying, \"Did you think I had forgotten you? Perhaps you hoped I had.\" In addition, in season 3, after an argument with Claire that ends with her storming out on him, a seething Underwood vents his anger by lashing out at the viewer; looking directly into the camera, he snaps \"What're you lookin' at?!\"\n\nFor the first four seasons, Underwood was the only character to break the fourth wall until the very end of the fourth season, during which Claire - though silent - addresses the camera directly with him. In the fifth season, Claire also addresses the camera directly, on one occasion explaining that she had always known they were there, but didn't know if she could trust them. At the end, after usurping the Presidency from Underwood and deciding not to grant him a pardon, she looks into the camera again and states \"My turn.\"\n\nAt the start of the show, Underwood is a Democratic Majority Whip in the House of Representatives, where he has represented South Carolina's 5th congressional district since 1990.\n\nUnderwood is passed over for an appointment as United States Secretary of State even though he had been promised the position after ensuring the election of Colorado Governor Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) as President. Walker's Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) gives him this news prior to the January 2013 United States presidential inauguration. With the aid of Claire, and his fiercely loyal Chief of Staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution. He quickly allies with \"Washington Herald\" reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), whom he uses to undermine his rivals via the press. The viciousness of Underwood's manipulations escalates over the course of the season. He befriends Pennsylvania Rep. Peter Russo (Corey Stoll), encouraging him to quit drinking and run for Governor of Pennsylvania; then his underlings create enough pressure in the race to push Russo into publicly falling off the wagon and ruining his career. Underwood finally murders him and makes it look like suicide. He persuades Vice President Jim Matthews (Dan Ziskie) to resign so he can run for the office he previously held, Governor of Pennsylvania, the race being wide open following Russo's death. In the season finale, \"Chapter 13\", Underwood is appointed Vice President to replace Matthews.\n\nUnderwood assumes the position of Vice President of the United States. Over the course of the season, he \"faces challenges from similarly ambitious businessmen, the Chinese government and Congress itself\" as he continues to pursue his political aspirations. His plotline revolves around battles with billionaire Raymond Tusk (Gerald McRaney), involving Chinese money laundering. Over the course of the season his biggest challenges are the institutional power of the Office of the President and Tusk's power as a billionaire industrialist.\n\nHe finds new rivals in Tusk, who seeks to maintain his position as Walker's right-hand adviser against Underwood's intrusion, and his former communications director, Remy Danton (Mahershala Ali), who is now a lobbyist working with Tusk.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, Underwood is trying to erase all links to Russo's death. Thus, he kills Barnes by shoving her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train, and frames her colleague and lover Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) for cyberterrorism. Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is finding his own replacement as House Majority Whip. He supports Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military veteran and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing.\n\nToward the end of the season, Underwood orchestrates Walker's downfall. He secretly leaks the details of the money laundering, for which Walker is blamed. While publicly supporting Walker, Underwood works behind the scenes to have him impeached, with Sharp's help. In the season finale, \"Chapter 26\", Walker resigns, and Underwood succeeds him as President of the United States.\n\nSeason 3 begins with Underwood's presidency off to a rocky start: six months into his term, he is unpopular with the public, and Congress is blocking his attempts to move legislation forward. He plans to secure his legacy with an ambitious jobs bill, America Works, but the Democratic Congressional leadership refuses to support it; they also tell him that they will not support him if he seeks the presidential nomination in the next election. He nominates Claire for United States Ambassador to the United Nations, but her nomination is defeated after she makes a gaffe during a Senate nomination hearing.\n\nUnderwood announces that he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by stripping entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women's votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Underwoods' marriage is faltering. Underwood gives Claire the ambassador job in a recess appointment, but she is forced to resign in order to solve a diplomatic crisis. Claire begins to question whether she still loves her husband, and they get into an ugly fight in which he tells her that she is nothing without him. Season 3 ends with Claire leaving Underwood as he prepares for the New Hampshire primary.\n\nUnderwood trails Dunbar in the polls, eventually losing the New Hampshire primary. Realizing that he needs Claire to win, he persuades her to come back by promising to support her run for a congressional district in Texas. However, he sandbags her prospective candidacy by endorsing a political ally's daughter, in order to keep Claire focused on his campaign. On the day of the South Carolina primary, Claire retaliates by arranging for two compromising photos to be leaked: one of Underwood's father with a Klansman, and one of Underwood posing with a Confederate Civil War re-enactor. Underwood deduces that Claire was behind the leaks, and confronts her. Claire calmly admits what she did, and puts forth a proposition: that she run as his vice president. He angrily rejects the idea.\n\nLucas Goodwin is released from prison and, seeking revenge for Barnes' death, shoots Underwood at a campaign rally, hitting him in the liver. He also mortally wounds Meechum, who manages to kill him before succumbing to his injuries. Underwood is rushed to the hospital for immediate surgery, and falls into a coma. It is soon discovered that he needs a liver transplant. Stamper manages to bump him to the top of the transplant list, and he survives. Once he recovers, he agrees to let Claire run as his vice president.\n\nDunbar drops out of the race due to the discovery of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin a few days before the attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to weed out potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.\n\nWhen American extremists loyal to the terrorist group Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO) kidnap a suburban family, Underwood allows Conway to negotiate with them, making his opponent look like a hero - and then releases NSA data that proves Conway illegally influenced Congress. Soon afterward, however, Underwood is hit with two crises at once: ICO's leader orders his followers to kill one of the hostages, while journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) exposes Underwood's crimes in the \"Washington Herald\". Facing disgrace and possible impeachment, Underwood decides to declare war on ICO and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that he and Claire can exploit in the weeks before the election.\n\nIn the days before the election, Underwood pushes Congress to formally declare war on ICO, and orders the CIA to kill one of the terrorists and make it look like he had died fleeing capture. Underwood still lags in the polls, however, and on election night it appears he is going to lose to Conway. With help from Stamper and campaign strategist LeAnn Harvey (Neve Campbell), Underwood has NSA contractor Aidan Macallan (Damian Young) stage a cyberattack on several election stations. He also uses the fear of a possible terrorist attack to pressure the governors of Tennessee and Ohio to halt voting. The tactics work; the two states refuse to declare a winner, and the election drags on unresolved for several weeks.\n\nThe presidency is finally set to be decided by a contingent election in the House. Neither Underwood nor Conway receive enough votes, however, so Underwood appoints Claire Acting President until the House votes again. Underwood tries to convince Arizona Congressman Alex Romero (James Martinez) to vote in his favor, but when Underwood refuses to help him with his own agenda, Romero forms a committee to impeach him.\n\nThe Underwoods blackmail Conway's influential campaign manager Mark Usher (Campbell Scott) into joining their side by threatening to release recordings of Conway berating a pilot and his running mate Ted Brockhart (Colm Feore) threatening to kill Frank. Once Usher begins working for them, they release the tapes anyway, which costs Conway the election. Underwood is now President-elect, but his past once again comes back to haunt him when Hammerschmidt writes a story linking him to Barnes' death.\n\nWhen Romero's committee intensifies its investigation, Underwood tries to divert public attention by ordering troops into Syria under the pretense of preventing a terrorist attack. This provokes Durant to testify against him; before she can take the stand, however, Underwood pushes her down a flight of stairs, incapacitating her. When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his own defense and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation is part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed, and persuades Stamper to \"confess\" to murdering Barnes.\n\nFor Underwood's plan to work, however, Claire has to pardon him and Stamper, which would damage her credibility with the public. Claire promises him that she will grant the pardons, but makes no mention of them during her first address to the nation as president. Angered, Underwood calls her several times, but each time he gets her voicemail, causing him to worry that she has abandoned him. He breaks the fourth wall and says, \"If she doesn't pardon me, I'll kill her.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\"' David Itzkoff called Underwood a \"scheming politician\" who does \"some of the most evil and underhanded things imaginable\". Brian Stelter of \"The New York Times\" said Underwood \"…is on a quest for power that's just as suspenseful as anything on television.\" \"New York Daily News\" critic Don Kaplan says \"…conniving Congressman Frank Underwood, is easily one of the most complex antiheroes on TV — except he's not on TV\". David Wiegand of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" describes the character as one who \"all but salivates over the chance to use his considerable power to gain more power, especially if it involves pulling the rug out from under some colleagues and the wool over the eyes of others.\"\n\nAndrew Davies, the producer of the original UK TV series, feels that Underwood lacks the \"charm\" of the original character, Francis Urquhart.\n\n\"The Independent\" praised Spacey's portrayal as a more \"menacing\" character, \"hiding his rage behind Southern charm and old-fashioned courtesy,\" while \"The New Republic\" noted that \"When Urquhart addressed the audience, it was partly in the spirit of conspiratorial fun. His asides sparked with wit. He wasn't just ruthlessly striving, he was amusing himself, mocking the ridiculousness of his milieu. There is no impishness about Spacey's Frank Underwood, just numb, machine-like ambition. Even his affection for his wife is a calculation.\"\n\nPoniewozik praises Underwood's accent, saying \"Spacey gives Underwood a silky Southern accent you could pour over crushed ice and sip with a sprig of mint on Derby Day.\" Nancy deWolf Smith of \"The Wall Street Journal\" describes the accent as a \"mild but sometimes missing Carolina accent\". \"Time\" listed Frank Underwood among the 11 most influential fictional characters in 2013.\n\nAccording to \"The Kansas City Star\" Smith, \"Frank hasn't changed, and neither has his brand of Machiavellian political theater\" and \"Spacey has lost none of his smarmy magnetism as the cartoon-ish villain\". According to \"Variety\" Brian Lowry, \"Kevin Spacey's showy performance as an unscrupulous politician\" is foremost among the show's strengths, but the show's weakness is the \"failure to present its scheming protagonist with equally matched foes\". Lowry feels that as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that \"nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him\". Goodman says \"Spacey is nothing if not constantly magnetic\". The delayed use of the fourth wall is perceived as clever. Alison Willmore of Indiewire says that \"Unlike Walter White or Tony Soprano, Frank feels at peace with his ruthless pragmatism and what he does in pursuit of power, and reminds us of the fact in his asides to the camera...he may be a ruthless sociopath, but there's something to admire there\". However, Willmore noted that Frank became lighter in season 2, noting that the season was \"...delivered with more of a wink by Frank than before.\"\n\nPoniewozik notes that \"It also remains a delight to watch Spacey pump the humid breath of life into House of Cards' arid Capitol chill. If only his character weren't so dominant of his surroundings as well. One reason the series' movements can feel so mechanical is that, so far, no one seems nearly in Underwood's league: not the adversaries he battles directly, nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their even knowing it.\" Chuck Barney of the \"San Jose Mercury News\" notes that the preview episodes show that \"Frank's \"Survivor\"-like back-stabbing is beginning to feel a bit repetitive.\" and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue: \"...things always seem to fall neatly into place for him. Even his showdowns with the president (Michel Gill) come off as one-sided...\" Verne Gay of \"Newsday\" notes that \"Frank Underwood has no remorse, no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum, and certainly no second thoughts. He is TV's perfect monster of the moment - a compleat malefactor, with a pleasing honey-toned drawl.\"\n\nAlessandra Stanley of \"The New York Times\" says \"By positing a Johnsonesque power broker and master schemer who wields cabalistic influence behind the scenes, \"House of Cards\" assigns order and purpose to what, in real life, is too often just an endless, baffling tick-tack-toe stalemate.\" NPR's Eric Deggans says that Underwood \"blends velvety charm and mesmerizing menace like no other character on television\".\n\n\"New York Observer\" critic Drew Grant notes that although the series aired during the golden age of dramatic antiheroes, Underwood's villainy has become trite: \"House of Cards is a good reminder, however, that there is a reason Iago wasn't the center of \"Othello\". Unrelenting, unexplained cruelty can be as pedantic as constant kindness.\"\n\nSpacey's portrayal was not without detractors: \"Hitfix\" reviewer Alan Sepinwall accused him of \"hamming it up\" and \"phoning it in on a not very good show to begin with\".\n\nReviews for season 3 of \"House of Cards\" were mostly positive. However, a few critics found the Underwood character was becoming repetitive: the critical consensus on the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes held that, \"Season three introduces intriguing new political and personal elements to Frank Underwood's character, even if it feels like more of the same for some.\" Ed Power of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote, \"Everyone in House of Cards has an agenda - a secret twitching in the attic. The thrill, and the horror, may lie in the degree to which we catch reflections of real life in its dark, cool contours.\" \n\nSome critics opined that the Underwood character is less interesting once he achieves his goal of becoming president and actually has to govern. \"You could take the show seriously just as long as you didn't have to take it seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics,\" wrote Aaron Bady of \"The New Republic\", who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of \"The West Wing\". \"But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage.\"\n\nCritics continued to praise Spacey's performance, however. Don Kaplan of \"The New York Daily News\" wrote, \"Underwood's bottomless appetite for dark dealing keeps Spacey so deliciously detestable you can't help but keep rooting for the bad guy to win.\" \n\nIn season 4, Jacob Solworthy wrote in his review of the first six episodes of season four: \"Until now, 'House of Cards' has centred on the character's outward expression of power -- not to mention his hunger for it -- but the writers have shrewdly stripped that back, instead focusing on the character's internal fears in a way not dissimilar from Tony's dream sequences in 'The Sopranos',\" he later added, \"You'll never root for Frank more than you do by the end of these six episodes.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Daniel Fienberg from \"The Hollywood Reporter\" was critical of Spacey's performance, writing: \" Spacey's performance, which at least had an appealingly theatrical extravagance when the series began, has grown less enjoyable. Having reached a pinnacle, there's no way to root for Frank's striving anymore, if you ever were, but House of Cards has yet to commit to urging us to root for Frank's downfall.\"\n\nThere was also considerable mention of the evolution of Underwood's relationship with Claire. \"[T]heir partnership has morphed into an entirely professional exercise, with a shared lust for power having supplanted more conventional matrimonial bonds,\" wrote Brian Lowry of \"Variety\". \"The Atlantic\"s Spencer Kornhaber remarked, however, that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a \"jump the shark\" moment for the series:\n\nThe Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist, and some innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities. Now, though, they've set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties. Netflix hasn't said how many seasons are to come, but it's hard to imagine the show being watchable for all that much longer now that this rubicon of despicability has been crossed.\n\nSome compared Underwood's story line in season 4 to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Brian Moyland of \"The Guardian\" wrote:\n\n\"House of Cards\" has never felt like the real presidency: Frank Underwood is evil incarnate, bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains. But now that, in real life, we're in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race, his machinations are starting to look almost viable. There are several parallels between Underwood's re-election campaign and the 2016 campaigns of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\nSpacey's performance as Frank Underwood in Season 5 - along with the series itself - received mixed reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of Vox Media called Spacey's performance \"hamstanding\", and said, \"It’s as if House of Cards wants to make Frank go full authoritarian dictator, but lacks the wherewithal to actually push its reality toward some sort of alternate dystopia.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\"s Daniel Flenberg called Spacey's Underwood \"increasingly broad and hammy\" in season 5, while \"Time\"s Daniel D'addario wrote that the character was too one-dimensional to elicit a good performance from Spacey: \"Underwood isn’t Nixonian or Clintonian (pick your villain); he’s a flat character for whom recognition is its own reward. This may make the show a surprisingly good fit for our times. But onscreen as in life, the desire for fame alone is insufficient motivation to compel viewers to stay tuned.\"\n\nOther critics praised him, however. \"Spacey’s honeysuckle drawl and flinty-eyed leer are as amusing as ever. He’s almost always the broadest performer in any given room, but that’s part of the show’s design — a way of drawing us into the character’s almost omnisciently evil mindset,\" wrote Vulture.com's Matt Zoller Seitz. \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Jeff Jensen wrote, \"Spacey seems invigorated by the material, and perhaps, our moment. He’s certainly buffed and honed Frank to a shine while grounding it, scuffing it, by playing to mortality and age. He’s an All-Star Survivor, but a gray one.\"\n\nCritics noted that the character of Frank Underwood gained a new resonance when considered in the context of the Trump administration. \"In a deliciously cynical flourish, the commander-in-chief’s response to whisperings about his misdeeds is to conjure a bogeyman in the shape of terrorist group Ico, which he presents as a clear and imminent danger to America,\" Ed Power wrote for \"The Telegraph\". \"This yields the returning series’s first stone-cold Trump-ism as Underwood announces plans to shut America’s borders to unwelcome outsiders. Real world events are further echoed as protestors gather outside the White House chanting 'not my President'.\"\n\nAt the 3rd Critics' Choice Television Awards, Spacey was nominated for Best Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Underwood.\n\nOn July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online only web television for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, \"Arrested Development\", \"Hemlock Grove\", and \"House of Cards\", earned nominations. For the first time, three Primetime Emmy nominations for lead roles were from web television series: Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series to Spacey for his portrayal of Frank Underwood, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series to Robin Wright for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series to Jason Bateman for his portrayal of Michael Bluth in \"Arrested Development\". Spacey submitted \"Chapter 1\" for consideration to earn his nomination. Spacey also earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama and a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series nominations.\n\nIn season 2, Spacey won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards and Screen Actors Guild Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as nominations for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards and a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Outstanding by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.\n\nIn season 3, Spacey was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards, his third nomination for the role. He also was nominated for both Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series at the 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nFor his performance in season 4, Spacey earned a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nFor his performance in season 5, Spacey received his fifth consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nomination for the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n"}

As the eldest Coppola sibling, he was the older brother to Roman and Sofia.\n\nGian-Carlo was close friends and once a couple with Tracy Reiner, daughter of director Penny Marshall.\n\nGian-Carlo began his professional filmmaking career at the age of 16, working closely with his father. Like his brother and sister, Gian-Carlo—known to his family and friends as Gio—often featured in his father's movies as background characters (\"The Godfather\", \"The Conversation\", \"Apocalypse Now Redux\" and \"Rumble Fish\"), later acting as associate producer for \"Rumble Fish\" and \"The Outsiders\", and second unit director on \"The Cotton Club.\"\n\nIn \"The Godfather\", he appeared with his brother Roman as the two sons of Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen character, and they can be seen during the street fight and Vito Corleone's funeral right behind Duvall and Al Pacino.\n\nDuring the pre-production phase of \"Gardens of Stone\", Gian-Carlo was given the responsibility of filming the rehearsals and supervising the electronic cinema staff. There was also potential for Gian-Carlo to intern with director Steven Spielberg to work on the television series \"Amazing Stories\" before his passing. Director Penny Marshall had also hired him to work on the second unit for her feature film \"Jumpin' Jack Flash.\"\n\nCoppola was killed in a speedboating accident on Memorial Day, 1986, aged 22, in Annapolis, Maryland. Griffin O'Neal, who was piloting the boat, had attempted to pass between two slow-moving boats, unaware that both boats were connected by a towline. While O'Neal barely had time to duck, Coppola was struck and killed. At the time of the incident, O'Neal was being directed by Francis Ford Coppola in \"Gardens of Stone\" and was subsequently replaced. O'Neal was later charged with manslaughter over the accident. He ultimately pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of \"negligent operation of a boat\", was fined $200 and sentenced to 18 months' probation in 1987. He eventually received an 18-day jail sentence for not performing 400 hours of community service as ordered.\n\nAt the time of his death, Coppola's fiancée, Jacqui de la Fontaine, was two months pregnant with their only daughter, Gian-Carla \"Gia\" Coppola (born on January 1, 1987). Gia is a writer-director, having made the 2013 film \"Palo Alto\".\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola subsequently dedicated 1988's \"\" to his son.

He was the first Indian to manufacture gramophones. Many of his businesses spurred from amateur pursuits.\n\nBose was born in 1866 in Mymensingh, where his father Haramohan Bose used to stay, the ancestral home of the family was in the village of Jaysiddhi, in Mymensingh District. According to Michael Kinnear, Bose was born in 1864 at his ancestral village. After passing I.A. he took admission in the Medical College Kolkata. While a student at the college, he suffered an accident where his eyes were scarred in acid. After recovering, he quit his medical career. In 1890, Bose began experimenting with perfume, and started his move into business.\n\nIn 1894, Bose started his own business in perfume manufacturing, the H-Bose Perfumers at 62 Bowbazar Street in Kolkata, where he distilled the perfumes. After the initial success, he added hair oil and other toiletries like lavender water, Eau de Cologne, milk of rose etc. to his range of products. He also set up a new manufacturing unit at 6 Shib Narayan Das Lane in Kolkata. His products included the famous Kuntalin hair oil and Delkhosh perfume.\n\nBy 1900, he had created a printing press and publishing house titled \"Kuntaline Press\" at 5 Shib Narayan Das Lane in Kolkata which incidentally was next door to his perfume business. In 1903, he instituted the Kuntalin Puraskar and encouraged young writers to showcase their talent. A short story written by Jagadish Chandra Bose was the first recipient of the Kuntalin Puraskar. Later Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's first printed publication \"Mandira\" won the Kuntalin Puraskar.\n\nBose was a bicycle enthusiast. He himself could ride the bicycle and taught his friends how to ride it. In 1903, he along with his brother Jatindra Mohon Bose established the first Indian-owned cycle works the H. Bose and Co, - Cycles at 63-1, Harrison Road. The company was also the distributors of the Rover bicycles. It was one of the first among his Swadeshi ventures. He also learnt how to drive a motor car. In 1900, he bought a two sitter motor car and used to drive it himself. He established the Great Eastern Motor Company and set up a repairing unit, the Great Eastern Motor Works in Park Street.\n\nIn 1900, Bose began to make sound recordings privately, after he had acquired an Edison phonograph. He began recording his friends in a leisurely fashion. Some of the first people recorded by H. Bose included his uncle, Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, P. C. Roy, and his good friend Rabindranath Tagore. His company became known as \"Bose Pathe Recordings\" which later became \"H. Bose Swadeshi Records\". By 1907, the demand for Bose's recordings grew so great that he began producing his own cylinders for recording. H. Bose was a well known patron of the Swadeshi movement and many of his records covered this subject.\n\nBose was the pioneer of color photography in India. He used Autochrome Lumière slides for his photographs. He was the founder president of Sporting Union.\n\n"}
{"id": "359937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359937", "title": "Hubie and Bertie", "text": "Hubie and Bertie\n\nHubie and Bertie are animated cartoon mouse characters in the Warner Bros. \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" series of cartoons. Hubie and Bertie represent some of animator Chuck Jones' earliest work that was intended to be funny rather than cute.\n\nAll of their cartoons were given Blue Ribbon reissues.\n\nJones introduced Hubie and Bertie in the short \"The Aristo-Cat\", first released on June 19, 1943. The plot of the cartoon would serve as the template for most future Hubie/Bertie outings: a character with some mental illness or degree of naïveté (here, a cat who doesn't know what a mouse looks like) is psychologically tormented by the pair. They tell the hungry cat that he is a lion and a bulldog his prey, leading to several painful encounters for the cat.\n\nHubie and Bertie as designed by Jones are nearly identical mice with long snouts, large ears, and big, black noses. The two are anthropomorphic, walking on their stubby hind legs and using their forelimbs as arms. They are primarily distinguished by their color: one is brown with a lighter-colored belly and face, while the other is gray. (Which mouse is which color changes from film to film.) Hubie has a Brooklyn accent. Bertie has large buck teeth, and a habit of responding to Hubie with \"Yeah-yeah, sure-sure!\" or snickering \"Riot!\" if Hubie has just proposed some scheme with comic potential.\n\nMel Blanc voiced Hubie. While historians differ on who voiced Bertie in the initial cartoon, Stan Freberg voiced him subsequently.\n\nBertie made a cameo in \"Odor-able Kitty\".\n\n\"Trap Happy Porky\" (February 24, 1945) was their second appearance. Nameless, indistinguishable except for color, they appear only in the first act, stealing food from a Porky in nightshirt & cap. They are silent except for a single \"I'm only three and a half years old\", and retreat when a cat shows up.\n\nJones would repeat the theme of mind-games several more times in his Hubie and Bertie shorts, as in their third cartoon, \"Roughly Squeaking\" on November 23, 1946. This time, Jones has the mice exploit a cat's stupidity by convincing him he's a lion and a dog is a moose he wants to eat. By the short's end, the cat thinks he's a lion, the dog believes he's a pelican, and a bystanding bird (driven mad from watching the two) has pulled his feathers out and imagines himself a Thanksgiving turkey. The mice are here voiced by Mel Blanc (Hubie) and Stan Freberg (Bertie).\n\nThe short was followed by \"House Hunting Mice\" on September 6, 1947, where Hubie and Bertie run afoul of a housekeeping robot.\n\nIn the next cartoon, \"Mouse Wreckers\", and for the remainder of the series, Blanc and Freberg would handle the voices of Hubie and Bertie, respectively.\n\nJones introduced a permanent \"antagonist\" of sorts for the mice in \"Mouse Wreckers\". The short was released in 1949 and was the first in which they are officially called \"Hubie\" and \"Bertie\". In the cartoon, the duo moves into a new home, only to discover that it is protected by champion mouser Claude Cat (the character's debut), voiced by Mel Blanc. The mice torment the cat both physically and mentally. The short was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nThe mice would antagonize Claude in two more films: \"The Hypo-Chondri-Cat\", released in 1950, featured Hubie and Bertie making Claude think he's sick with various ailments and, ultimately, that he has died. In 1951's \"Cheese Chasers\", Hubie and Bertie inadvertently torment Claude when, after going overboard on a cheese raid and getting sick of their favorite food, they decide to commit suicide by trying to get Claude to eat them.\n\nAfter these seven cartoons, Jones retired Hubie and Bertie but continued to use the characters (or mice resembling them) in cameo roles in other shorts whenever he needed a generic mouse for a gag, such as the unnamed mouse in \"Chow Hound\", who resembles Bertie, or the \"killer\" mice in \"Scaredy Cat\".\n\nAll of the Hubie and Bertie cartoons are available, remastered, on \"\" on DVD and Blu-Ray.\n\nHubie and Bertie have made several cameos in Warner Bros. productions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is best known as having been one of the Victoria's Secret Angels from 2005 to 2016 and for her work with \"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue\" and Armani Exchange.\n\nGoulart was born in São Carlos, São Paulo. She is of Portuguese and Italian descent, and has four brothers and one sister. Goulart once said, \"the hardest part about being [a Victoria's Secret Angel] is I spend time away from my mom's food and away from my home with my five brothers and sister\". School was a particularly rough time for Goulart, as she was made fun of for her skinny build and was called names such as \"giraffe\".\n\nWhile shopping for groceries with her mother at age 14, a hairstylist suggested that she should become a model. She moved to the state capital, São Paulo, and started modeling, moving to France shortly afterwards to develop her career. Goulart returned to São Paulo in August 2001 (aged 17), where she joined former agency Success. Her career in the Brazilian fashion world was launched by Ney Alves, currently the director of Major Models Brazil.\n\nDuring Goulart's first ever fashion show appearance, she experienced a wardrobe malfunction when her top fell open. The incident made many Brazilian newspapers. She eventually put this event behind her and returned to the runway to model collections for A-list designers such as Alberta Ferretti, Bill Blass, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Isabel Marant, Givenchy, Altuzarra, Oscar de la Renta, Valentino, Balmain, Jil Sander, Chanel, Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren, Emilio Pucci, Dolce and Gabbana, Emanuel Ungaro, Loewe, Roberto Cavalli and Stella McCartney, among others.\nGoulart has also modeled for H&M, Express, Neiman Marcus, Missoni and DSquared².\n\nIn 2005, Goulart appeared on the covers of the April edition of \"Marie Claire\" France and, in December, \"Vogue\" Brazil. She first appeared in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2005, the year she was contracted as an Angel. She received a star on the Hollywood \"Walk of Fame\" prior to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2007.

In 2008, she replaced fellow Victoria's Secret Angel Alessandra Ambrosio as the face of A/X Armani Exchange and she was featured in three seasonal print campaigns for the label. \n\nIn 2010, Goulart appeared on the cover of the October issue for \"GQ Mexico\", \"Vogue\" Brasil and appeared in a campaign for Avon. In the same year, she was voted the best international top model by the magazine \"Glamour\" Mexico.\n\nIn 2011, Goulart appeared in the \"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue\". She can be seen in the spring/summer 2011 campaign for Dolce and Gabbana, the Pre-Fall 2011 campaign for Givenchy, Yamamay's 10th Anniversary Collection and the Fall/Winter 2011 campaign for DKNY Jeans. The same year, she ranked number 100 in \"FHM\" magazine's list of the 100 Sexiest Women In The World. She also appeared on one of the four covers of Elle Brasil.\n\nIn February 2012, she was photographed by Dusan Reljin for \"Vogue\" Spain, and later that year by Mario Testino, again for \"Vogue\" Spain, in an editorial entitled \"Las majas\", which also featured Alessandra Ambrosio, Doutzen Kroes, Miranda Kerr and Isabeli Fontana. In November, she was recognised as \"Fashion Personality of the Year\" by the Brazilian magazine \"Isto é Gente\", and she also appeared on the cover of \"Glamour\" Brazil in December 2012.\n\nIn February 2013 she appeared on the cover of one of the four issues of \"Vogue\" Brasil, together with Bette Franke, Magdalena Frackowiak, and Mirte Maas.\n\nIn mid-2013, she became the face of MAC Cosmetics Tropical Taboo range and she was photographed by Zee Nunes for the October edition of \"Vogue\" Brazil in an editorial entitled \"Olympiada Fashion\". Later that year she appeared in a campaign for Agua De Coco promoting its spring/summer 2014 beachwear collection. She also appeared on the cover of \"GQ\" Portugal in December 2013, after she was elected as the magazine's \"International Woman of the Year\" in May of that year.\n\nIn 2007, Goulart won the Cool Magazine's \"Toshiba Cool Planet Award\" in the category of \"Best Model\". As a Victoria's Secret Angel, she was chosen as one of \"People\" magazine's annual \"100 Most Beautiful People in the World\" in May 2007.\n\nShe can speak English and French.\n\nGoulart, whose brother has type 1 diabetes, does charitable work, helping hospitals in her native Brazil to raise money to provide free insulin for diabetic children in need. She also has taken an active role with the Diabetes Research Institute (DRI) at the University of Miami, a recognized leader in cure-focused research. In 2009, Goulart became the DRI's international ambassador and in that role helps to promote the work of the DRI throughout her travels.\n\nIn 2009 she began engaged to Brazilian footballer Marcelo Costa, but they are no longer a couple.. In 2016 she began dating German goalkeeper of Paris Saint-Germain F.C., Kevin Trapp. On July 5, 2018, they became engaged.\n\n\n"}

Komol was doing well in the youth and in the second team and he was training with the first team. On November 15, 2000, Vitesse chairman Jos Vaessen announced that Komol tested positive for HIV.

Komol's playing license was suspended by the KNVB. Research showed that the risk of transmission during the game was less than 0.1% in Komol's case.\n\nHe was allowed to play again but the treatment of his disease prevented him from making the Vitesse team again.

Beginning in 1933, she published Britain's \"Saturday Review\", which was best known for its attacks on what the paper labelled the \"unpatriotic\" National Government of Ramsay MacDonald. She has been acknowledged as an aviation pioneer, \"the saviour of the Spitfire\".\n\nFanny Lucy Radmall was the daughter of Thomas Radmall, a woollen warehouseman and draper, and Maria Isabella Clark. She was born at 13 Lower Kennington Green, Lambeth, the ninth child of ten children. As a young woman, she was a professional dancer, a chorus girl known as \"Poppy\". At the age of sixteen, she ran off to Paris with a wealthy man twice her age, Frederick Gretton, whose family owned the Bass Brewery. He was married at the time. Despite a tumultuous relationship, Gretton bequeathed Poppy £6,000 per year for life when he died in 1882.\n\nOn 3 September 1883, she married Lt.-Col. Sir Theodore Francis Brinckman, 3rd Baronet (1862–1937), the couple divorcing in 1895 after a long separation. She remarried in 1901, to George Frederick William Byron, 9th Baron Byron. During their marriage, she was an active suffragette. He died in 1917, the same year Lucy, then Baroness Byron, was appointed Dame Commander, Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her support of a home for nurses who had served in the First World War.\n\nHer third and final marriage was to Sir Robert Houston, 1st Baronet, Member of Parliament for West Toxteth, and a shipping magnate, on 12 December 1924. Houston is described in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" as \"a hard, ruthless, unpleasant bachelor\". They lived as tax exiles on the island of Jersey. When Sir Robert showed her his will, Lady Houston reportedly tore it up, telling him that £1,000,000 was insufficient. Sir Robert then suffered a series of mental disorders and reportedly employed a food taster to ensure that he was not being poisoned. Sir Robert died on his yacht \"Liberty\", on 14 April 1926, leaving his widow roughly £5.5 million.\n\nLady Houston left Jersey on the \"Liberty\", negotiating with the British Government during passage to England the payment of £1.6 million in death duties. According to the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", \"she paid for nine by-election meetings by the British National Government to be disrupted\".\n\nLady Houston gave generously to British aviation. In 1931, she donated £100,000 to Supermarine, allowing them to win the Schneider Trophy in that year. The Royal Air Force's entry for the 1931 race for the trophy was hindered by political opposition. On 15 January 1931, the Air Ministry refused a last-minute request by the Royal Aero Club for funds for an entry. The Ministry forbade the use of the aircraft that competed in the 1929 race; forbade RAF pilots of the High Speed Flight who were trained to fly these seaplanes, to take part; and said that it would not police the race course in 1931 in the busy shipping lanes in the Solent. The Royal Aero Club sent a statement to the Cabinet on 22 January 1931, offering to raise £100,000, if the Government would rescind the Air Ministry's decrees on planes, pilots and policing.\n\nMany newspapers backing the opposition Conservative Party wanted to put pressure on Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government. One newspaper sent a telegram to MacDonald stating that, \"To prevent the socialist government from being spoilsports, Lady Houston will be responsible for all extra expenses beyond what Sir Philip Sassoon (President of the Royal Aero Club) says can be found, so that Great Britain can take part in the race for the Schneider trophy.\" The gift gave Lady Houston an opportunity to attack the Labour government, with the declaration \"Every true Briton would rather sell his last shirt than admit that England could not afford to defend herself.\"\n\nThere were only nine months to prepare, and so Supermarine's designer Reginald Mitchell could only update the existing airframes. Rolls-Royce increased the power of the R-Type engine by 400 hp to 2,300 hp. The improved Supermarine S.6B won the trophy, though the technical achievement is slightly tarnished by the fact two S6Bs and an S6 were the only participants. (One S6B later broke the air speed record.) \n\nLady Houston's gift provided a valuable impetus to the development of the engine technology that would ultimately be vital in the Second World War, and in particular the Battle of Britain. The lessons learned in building racing seaplanes also helped Mitchell to develop the Supermarine Spitfire. As Arthur Sidgreaves, the managing director of Rolls-Royce, commented at the time, \"It is not too much to say that research for the Schneider Trophy contest over the past two years is what our aero-engine department would otherwise have taken six to ten years to learn.\"\n\nIn 1932, she offered to give £200,000 to strengthen the British army and navy. The National Government refused. She hung a huge electric sign, \"DOWN WITH MACDONALD THE TRAITOR\", in the rigging of \"Liberty\" and sailed round Great Britain. In a telegram to the Prime Minister, she wrote: \n\nIn 1933, she financed the Houston-Mount Everest Flight Expedition, in which aircraft flew over the summit of Everest for the first time. This was to show opposition to granting independence to India. In October 1934, Lady Houston sent a cable to the winners of the MacRobertson England to Melbourne Air Race, Tom Campbell Black and C. W. A. Scott: \"Your achievement has thrilled me through, oh brave men of my heart... If this does not make the Government sit up, nothing will ... Sleep well and feel proud of yourselves, as we all are ... Rule Britannia. God bless you both.\"\n\nLady Houston was so upset by the Abdication Crisis in 1936 that she stopped eating and died of a heart attack on 29 December 1936, aged 79, at her home, Byron Cottage, Hampstead Heath. She had no children and left no current will, so administration was granted to her sole surviving sibling, Mrs Florence Wrey, of more than 1.5 million pounds.\n\nLady Houston, her donation to Supermarine and the electric sign in the rigging were depicted in the 1942 film \"The First of the Few\", though the sign more diplomatically states: \"Down with the government. Wake up, England!\"\n\n"}

At a public and political science circles, General Karamat had a popular support and occupied a prestigious image in the country for his role to promote democratic process in the country. His dismissal remains a controversial topic in the field of civil-military relations, and the move remains still questionable at the political science circles of Pakistan.\n\nA war veteran of Indo-Pakistani wars and former professor of political science at the National Defence University (NDU), General Karamat was an apolitical and professional military leader, but confrontation involving the Fourteenth Amendment and matters of principle of civilian control of the military was ingrained, which eventually led the relieving of General Jehangir Karamat from his command of the military by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on October 1998.\n\nAs scheduled, the general elections were held on 3 February 1997, which marked the return of Nawaz Sharif with an exclusive, two-third majority in the Parliament. Just after days of re-electing for his second term, Prime Minister Sharif faced serious constitutional crises with the Supreme Court and the Presidency on the other side. Nawaz Sharif made very important Constitutional Amendments that inserted in the Constitution which introduced termination of the Eighth Amendment and passing of the Thirteenth Amendment, with the enaction of the anti-corruption bill in 1997.\n\nSharif's constitutional moves were challenged by the Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and President Farooq Leghari; both were forced to reign by Nawaz Sharif on 2 December 1997. After Sharif ordering the nuclear tests in 1998 and his unsuccessful attempt to pass the Fifteenth Amendment, a number of military officers publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over administration. This confrontation led to the resignation of General Jehangir Karamat on 7 October 1998. General Karamat was replaced by General Pervez Musharraf.\n\nIn stature and seniority, General Karamat was a foremost army generals in the Pakistan Military. A son of civil servant and a highly decorated war veteran of Indo-Pakistani wars, Karamat was an academic who graduated with a top of his PMA Kakul class of 1961 and later fully tenured as professor of political science at the National Defence University (NDU) during most of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nKaramat was a recipient of Pakistan's highest military and civilian honours as well as occupied a good image in country's public circles. He had a distinguish combat career, and many of his students at NDU would ascended in prestigious combat assignments in the country's military science circles. In 1995, Karamat gained national publicity after thwarting the conspiracy against Prime minister Benazir Bhutto, and his credentials would lead to him to be appointed simultaneously to four-star assignments, Chief of Army Staff and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee by Benazir Bhutto.\n\nThe conservative mass led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had come to the power with a two-majority as a result of 1997 general elections. Sharif established the Anti Terrorism Courts (ATC), Anti-Corruption Bill and passed the Fourteenth Amendment to the constitution, all in 1997. After criticising the Chief Justice, the supreme court summoned Nawaz Sharif of Contempt of court and appeared in supreme court with party workers, members, chief ministers, and constituents to hear the proceedings. Unruly party workers stormed into the Supreme Court, forcing Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah to remove the finding of contempt against Prime minister Sharif. Hundreds of PML-N supporters and members of its youth wing, the Muslim Students Front (MSF), breached the police barrier around the courthouse when defence lawyer S.M. Zafar was arguing Sharif's case. The partisans invaded the supreme court premises and intimated the senior judges at the supreme court; all of this actions were recorded in security cameras and television channels broadcast the event nationwide.\n\nChief Justice Shah wrote a letter to President Farooq Leghari to call for armed forces actions against Sharif. However, the constant pressure of Farooq Leghari deteriorated his health and resigned from the presidency. Chief Justice Shah's tenured was cut short when Sharif appointed Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui in his place, and his appointment was approved by the new president; Shah also resigned from the supreme court after hearing the news on television channels.\n\nAfter ordering the nuclear tests in 1998, Prime minister Sharif chaired the Defence Committee of the Cabinet (DCC) session with the chairman and chiefs of armed forces to overview the situation with India. Although both Nawaz Sharif and general Jehangir Karamat were educated and hold common beliefs concerning the national security, but problems arose with chairman joint chiefs and chief of army staff general Karamat on October 1998.\n\nWhile addressing the naval officers and cadets at the Naval War College, general Karamat stressed the re-creation of National Security Council (instead of DCC) which would be backed by a \"team of civil-military experts\" for devising policies to seek resolution ongoing problems relating the civil-military issues; also recommended a \"neutral but competent bureaucracy and administration of at federal level and the establishment of Local governments in four provinces.\n\nThis proposal was met with hostility, and it succeeded all in accomplishing was pricking the Prime minister's highly inflated altered ego. Nawaz Sharif's dismissal of general Karamat, plummeted his mandate in the public circles and criticism he received from Leader of the Opposition Benazir Bhutto was rogue.\n\nSharif summoned the chairman joint chiefs and notified him of his relieving from the service. On 6 October 1998, Nawaz Sharif dismissed and signed the relieving papers which went on effect immediately. Many in Pakistan became surprised of Sharif's moved since the dismissal of four-star general was never happened before in country's short history.\n\nWith Karamat's dismissal, it was widely felt in the armed forces that Sharif had ruthlessly established his control all over the country, including the military. The dismissal of General Karamat was least popular decision in Sharif's prime ministerial ship, and his approval ratings plummeted. Media Minister Syed Mushahid Hussain and later Prime minister himself justified his actions on national and international media:\n\nThe relieve of General Karamat was a heated issue discussed even by his senior government ministers. The most-senior and the former Treasury minister Sartaj Aziz gave vehement criticism and showed opposition to the Prime minister for making this move.\n\nWriting a thesis in his book, \"Between Dreams and Realities: Some Milestones in Pakistan’s History\", Aziz maintained: \"Blunder of firing of General Karamatt; others will blame Nawaz Sharif for many mistakes he made. But in my view, the most serious of these mistakes was Nawaz Sharif’s decision to remove General Jehangir Karamat as chief of army staff in October 1998\". Aziz was extremely confident and certain that Chief of General Staff Lieutenant-General Ali Kuli Khan would be appointed as the Chief of Army Staff based on his seniority, merit, among a very competent officer, and next in seniority to General Karamat.\nIn 1999, Nawaz Sharif later dismissed Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Fasih Bokhari to promote General Musharraf to chairman joint chiefs. The following month, a failed attempt to dismiss Musharraf led to a military coup d'état against Prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999.\n\n"}

Megee later gave contradictory statements as to how he came to be stranded crossing the Northern Territory and Western Australia. On one occasion he said that his car broke down, and on another that he had been carjacked by an armed gang. However, a doctor later confirmed that Megee's appearance was consistent with having lived in extreme conditions. Like most deserts, the Tanami can reach during the day but still be very cold at night. Megee made his own primitive shelters and survived by drinking rainwater and eating small animals and available vegetation for nourishment. He was eventually discovered by a group of station hands near Katherine, Northern Territory, and taken to Darwin for medical assistance. Although some doubts were later raised as to the exact chain of events as Megee related them, the police did not find evidence that a criminal offence had occurred. \n\nRicky Megee was born in 1971 in Gippsland, Victoria; he later described his childhood as a happy one, until the family moved to Melbourne, where his father later killed himself. Megee worked at a variety of jobs. He was, variously, a carpet salesman, prawn fisherman, nightclub doorman, and an electrician. He eventually became a bailiff. Eventually, he went to jail after being involved in a fight in Perth, as well as for drug offences. In 2006 he was 35 years old and living in Queensland.\n\nIn January 2006 Megee had been offered work in a government department in Port Hedland, Western Australia. He accepted the job, and set off on the long drive, which he had made multiple times before. Driving a 2001 Mitsubishi Challenger he took the Buntine Highway, which for much of his journey was a desert track across the outback of the Northern Territory.\n\nThe events leading to Megee being stranded are somewhat confused, and indeed, Megee's version of how events unfolded changed significantly over time. He first told his rescuers that his car had broken down, but then, The Washington Post reported, he claimed \"that he'd been drugged by hitchhikers and left for dead\". Megee later elaborated on how this scenario unfolded, saying he had picked up a lone Aboriginal hitchhiker between the towns of Kalkaringi and Halls Creek. He believed that at some point the hitchhiker drugged Megee's drink at some point. Megee said that although he normally always opened his own drinks from the car refrigerator, on this occasion he allowed his passenger to open one for him. \n\nLater, in his 2010 autobiography, Megee said that there had been three men sitting on the roadside, who had run out of petrol, and that he had offered to give one of them a lift to a petrol station. Megee also posited that he could have been stabbed with a drugged-syringe during a struggle. Either way, Megee later recalled feeling increasingly \"dazed and confused\", and then blacked out before he recovered consciousness hours later. He also said that his attackers did not leave him immediately: they over-powered and stunned him. He later awoke in their camp. They had a gun, wrote Megee, but never used it; they did bring him water. After an unknown period, the carjackers lifted camp and disappeared. Before they left, they stole his shoes, but left him with $12.30 which had been in his pocket. \n\nWhen he regained consciousness, he said, he was in a hole, covered in black plastic, which had had \"some rocks and dirt thrown on top\". Megee suggested that it was only the attempts by four dingoes to claw him that woke him up.\n\nMegee walked for ten days through the northeastern fringe of the Tanami Desert. He often lost consciousness through heat exhaustion, as temperatures regularly went above . According to Mark Clifford, a local man who later witnessed Megee's arrival, although the temperatures were high, it was also the middle of the wet season, which was in Megee's favour. When combined with the abundance of small wild animals and Megee's \"hardy constitution\", his chances of survival were, with hindsight, relatively good. However, it was never clearly established precisely how Megee became as lost as he did.\n\nMegee said that he survived by eating leeches, insects, snakes, ants and lizards, and edible plants. He drank water from \"various dams and waterholes\" and scavenged in the bush every evening, eating \"one meal a day, just enough to stay alive\". When water was unavailable, he drank his urine after chilling it to suppress the flavour.\n\nMegee—\"baked in the day and frozen at night\"—created temporary shelters from the sun out of old branches, and eventually found a decrepit windmill. Megee said that he made \"a little humpy out of a feed trough that was at some cattle yards, obviously a mustering point, I thought to myself, so I've dragged it up on top of the dam, flipped it over and dug a hole and just lived in there for 10 weeks.\" Megee became dangerously weak, to the extent that he was unable to travel as far on his daily foraging expeditions. At one point he suffered an abscess of the tooth that—weakened as he was—could have been fatal, and which he prised out of his mouth with his car keys.\n\nMegee was eventually discovered about from Birrindudu Station, about southwest of Katherine, Northern Territory. His rescuers were local station hands and their trainees, known as jackaroos. By now, Megee was starving, sunburnt, and suffering from malnutrition and exposure. Birrindudu Station manager, Mark Clifford, described Megee as \"just a walking skeleton\" when he was brought to the station, and said that the area he was found in was one of the \"most isolated places in Australia\".\n\nOn 5 April 2006 Megee was flown to the Royal Darwin Hospital, where medical staff described him as \"emaciated, but...well hydrated\". While in Darwin Hospital, Megee was interviewed by Northern Territory police, although they dismissed suggestions that there was any question of criminal activity on Megee's part. Indeed, they said they were unable to find any evidence of criminality at all, or even Megee's stolen car. Megee discharged himself from hospital after six days.\n\nMegee's Challenger was never recovered, and Megee himself lost , or over half his original bodyweight, which was over .\n\nThe \"Sydney Morning Herald\" subsequently suggested that there were \"some doubts\" over elements of Megee's account, and reported that Megee was attempting to sell his story to \"a commercial television station\". It was also reported that the police, too, initially \"had doubts about the story because of Megee's previous minor drug convictions\". Megee refuted allegations that his account was in any way misleading and even offered to appear live on television and eat frogs to prove he was telling the truth. ABC Radio reported that Megee had told his story to them for free—although only after trying, unsuccessfully, to persuade the station to match a A$15,000 offer he said he had received from elsewhere. The doctor who treated Megee in Darwin commented that it was \"very difficult to either deny or validate\" his story, as he had responded so well to the treatment provided by dieticians, nutritionists and physicians.\n\nBush Tucker Man Les Hiddins—considered an expert on outback survival—acknowledged that Megee's survival was not as surprising as might have been thought. It was possible, he said, to survive in the bush for up to three years, and that \"there are some areas where it's difficult to survive, and others where you can\". For example, the area where Megee was, Hiddins described as \"dry country which is, you know, that's pretty severe country in there\". Other survival experts credit Megee's survival on his \"instinctively solving the basic requirements of water, food and shelter—and adopting a survival mindset that pulled him through\". \n\nMegee subsequently wrote a book on his experience and emigrated to Dubai to work in construction.\n\n"}

It concerns film director Roman Polanski and his sexual abuse case. It examines the events that led to Polanski fleeing the United States after being embroiled in a controversial trial, and his unstable reunion with his adopted country. A follow-up to the film, also directed by Zenovich, titled \"Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out\" was released on 26 March 2013, detailing Polanski's successful legal battle to avoid extradition to the US, a battle that took place after \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\" came out.\n\nMetacritic rates \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\" a score of 78/100 based on 16 reviews (\"generally favorable\"). Rotten Tomatoes scores the film at 89% positive reviews based on 46 reviews.\n\nCathleen McGuigan, reviewing the film for Newsweek, referred to the film as \"deft and subtle\" and particularly noted \"an enigmatic little scene near the end [where] [y]ou see a fierce old whale of a man in a chair, banging a drum while an elfin youth jumps and hops to the beats, like a puppet on a string. The hopping boy finally escapes his tormentor by scurrying and tumbling across a field, running toward the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The tyrannized, barefoot kid is Polanski himself, and the footage is from a 16-minute short called 'The Fat and the Lean' that he made in 1961, on the brink of his fame as a brilliant new European director. The wordless scene may last less than a minute in Marina Zenovich's documentary, but it sticks with you, and it echoes another clip in her film. This one is from a television interview Polanski did decades later where he says he felt like 'a mouse with which an abominable cat was making sport.' The cat in question was Los Angeles Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, who'd presided over the director's 1977 criminal case for having sex with a 13-year-old girl.\"\n\nOne negative review by Bill Wyman, writing for Salon, stated: \"The film, which has inexplicably gotten all sorts of praise, whitewashes what Polanski did in blatant and subtle fashion[.] The tone is set early on, when a friend of Polanski's tells of being woken up and informed that the director had to call his attorney. The moment is actually played for laughs, with interspersed shots of a worried Mia Farrow using the phone in a scene from 'Rosemary's Baby' — that, too, about a horrifically abused woman. But the scene isn't used to illustrate the victim's story -- it's about poor Roman. He's the person making the desperate phone call. It's an odd juxtaposition when you think about it.\"\n\nNathan Southern of Allmovie writes that, \"filmmaker Marina Zenovich revisits this difficult case via extensive interviews with Geimer [the underage victim], defense attorney Douglas Dalton, Assistant DA Roger Gunson, and others. In the process, she raises pivotal questions about the U.S. legal system and the fairness of the judge, Laurence J. Rittenband (who was reportedly extremely vocal about his desire to topple Polanski) and encounters many recollections of judicial malfeasance from those who were involved.\"\n\n\"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\" was nominated for five primetime Emmy Awards and won two: \"Outstanding Directing For Nonfiction Programming\" and \"Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming\". The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures awarded it the title of one of the top 5 documentaries of 2008. It won the \"Editing Award Documentary\" at the Sundance Film Festival It was also listed as one of ten films in the \"Hall of Shame\" of the 2008 Women Film Critics Circle Awards.\n\nAfter the arrest of Roman Polanski in Switzerland in 2009, David Wells, now a retired deputy district attorney, recanted the interview he gave the director about advising the judge in the case in \"ex parte\" communication.

Following his senior season in which he threw for 2,029 yards and 17 touchdowns in 12 games, Bradford was named to the Oklahoma Coaches Association All-State Team and was a Second-Team All-State pick by \"The Oklahoman\".\n\nBradford was also a Division I-caliber basketball player. As a senior, he averaged 18.6 points and 10.5 rebounds per game and played on the same elite AAU team as fellow Oklahoma City native and Detroit Pistons star Blake Griffin. In golf, Bradford defeated future PGA touring pros Kevin Tway and Robert Streb during his high school career. In addition to the aforementioned sports, Bradford also played hockey in his youth. In 1999, when Bradford was 12, his travel team, the Junior Blazers, won a regional championship, beating a team from Houston. He quit the sport that same year, and according to his former hockey coach Mike McEwen, who played on three Stanley Cup championship teams with the New York Islanders, Bradford had the talent to make it in the NHL. McEwen also said that Bradford was one of the best players he ever coached.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, by the end of Bradford's junior season, he garnered interest from several Division I programs, including Stanford, Michigan, Texas Tech, and nearby Oklahoma. Following his senior season, Bradford was viewed as a two-to-three-star recruit and was not that highly ranked among the high school class of 2006, with his highest ranking being No. 12 among only pro-style quarterbacks by recruiting source \"Rivals.com\". Bradford was ranked behind Pat Devlin, \"Juice\" Williams and Josh Freeman, and was overshadowed by the likes of five-star recruits like Mitch Mustain, Matthew Stafford and Tim Tebow.\n\nBradford received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Oklahoma, where he played for coach Bob Stoops's Oklahoma Sooners football team from 2006 to 2009. He redshirted as a freshman in 2006 before becoming the starter in 2007 and turning in one of the best seasons ever by a quarterback, passing for 4,720 yards with 50 touchdowns and just eight interceptions. As a result, he won the Heisman Trophy, becoming the fifth Oklahoma player to win the award. After Oklahoma lost the 2009 BCS National Championship Game 24-14 to Florida, Bradford, instead of declaring for the upcoming draft, elected to return to Oklahoma for another crack at the title. He ended up playing in just three games due to a shoulder injury, and the Sooners, ranked No. 3 to start the season, finished with a 8-5 record.\n\nIn 2006, Oklahoma's starting quarterback Rhett Bomar, then a sophomore, was dismissed from the team for violating NCAA rules. Paul Thompson, a senior quarterback-turned-wide receiver, converted back to quarterback and led the 2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team to win the Big 12 Championship Game. His departure left a void at the quarterback position at Oklahoma. Six players on the roster tried out for the starting position during the following off-season, including three walk-on quarterbacks, true freshman Keith Nichol (a Rivals.com 4-star recruit and 6th-ranked dual-threat quarterback in the 2007 recruiting class, who later transferred to Michigan State University), junior Joey Halzle (the only one with game experience), and Bradford, a redshirt freshman. On August 21, 2007, Bradford won the starting quarterback role for the 2007 team.\n\nIn his first game for the Sooners, against the University of North Texas, Bradford completed 21 of 23 attempts for 363 yards and three touchdowns in a little over two quarters, breaking the school record for passing yards in a half, held by his quarterback coach Josh Heupel, with 350. The very next game, Bradford broke Heisman Trophy winner Jason White's school record for most consecutive pass completions with 22 (18 came in the first half and four at the start of the second).\n\nIn the second week of the 2007 season, Bradford was named the national offensive player of the week by the Walter Camp Football Foundation after tying the school record for most touchdown passes in a game with five. Having thrown 25 touchdowns through his first nine games, Bradford was on pace to break the NCAA freshman record of 29 touchdowns set by David Neill in 1998 and tied by Colt McCoy in 2006.\n\nIn the November 17, 2007 game against Texas Tech, Bradford suffered a concussion of unknown severity. He was removed from the game and replaced by back-up quarterback Joey Halzle. The Sooners lost the game, 27–34. Bradford was able to play in the Bedlam game against Oklahoma State on November 24.\n\nDuring the November 24, 2007 game against the Oklahoma State Cowboys, Bradford broke the NCAA freshman record of 29 touchdowns by passing his 30th touchdown to Joe Jon Finley during the second quarter. At the Missouri Tigers game, Bradford threw for 209 yards and 0 interceptions. He was 18–26 and threw for two touchdowns.\n\nThe Sooners won the Big 12 Championship after defeating Missouri for the second time in a season. The Sooners played the West Virginia Mountaineers in the Fiesta Bowl on January 2, 2008 and lost 48–28. It was Bradford's first Bowl Championship Series game as a starter.\n\nIn week 8 of the following season against Kansas, Bradford surpassed quarterback coach Josh Heupel's school record for passing yards in a single game with 468 yards. Bradford led the Sooners to their third straight Big 12 Championship and defeated Missouri 62–21. In the process, the Sooners broke Hawaii's 2006 record for the most points in a single season with 702 points. Also, the Sooners were the first team in NCAA history to score 60 or more points in five straight games. Oklahoma finished the 2008 regular season with a 12–1 record, ranking #2 in the AP Poll and #1 in the BCS Standings. The Sooners earned a trip to play Florida at the 2009 BCS National Championship Game.\n\nAfter the regular season, Bradford captured the Davey O'Brien Award and the Heisman Trophy. He is the second sophomore, after 2007 winner Tim Tebow of the University of Florida, to receive the Heisman; he also became the fifth University of Oklahoma player, as well as the second person of Native American descent to capture the trophy after Jim Plunkett. Bradford received 1,726 total points while the other finalists, Colt McCoy, of the University of Texas, and Tim Tebow, received 1,604 and 1,575, respectively. Tebow, however, collected more first-place votes, 309, while Bradford got 300. Bradford got the most points thanks to the help of his 315 second-place votes. A total of 926 voters participated in the balloting.\n\nWhen combined with Blake Griffin's Naismith Award, Oklahoma became the first school to have a winner in both top basketball and football individual awards in the same year. Bradford was also voted Associated Press College Football Player of the Year. Bradford received 27 votes, again beating McCoy (17 votes) and Tim Tebow (16 votes). Bradford is the third Oklahoma Sooner to win the award, joining Josh Heupel (2000) and Jason White (2003). Heupel and White were also quarterbacks, with Heupel being the current quarterbacks coach for Oklahoma.\n\nBradford faced Florida, led by Tebow, in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game. He threw 26-of-41 passes for 256 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions, as Florida won the game 24–14.\n\nBradford announced that he would forgo the 2009 NFL Draft to return to Oklahoma for his junior season. In the Sooners' first game of the season (against Brigham Young), Bradford suffered a third-degree AC joint sprain one play after becoming Oklahoma's all-time passing leader. Playing without Bradford for the second half of the game, Oklahoma went on to lose 14–13. Bradford was originally scheduled to return in about three to six weeks, but head coach Bob Stoops initially refused to either confirm or deny that timetable. After missing three weeks, Bradford returned to the field during the Baylor game, and completed 27 of 49 passes for 389 yards and one touchdown, leading the Sooners to a 33–7 victory. Bradford re-injured his right shoulder on October 17, 2009 in the Red River Rivalry against Texas on the second drive of the game. It was later announced that he would undergo season-ending shoulder surgery and enter the 2010 NFL Draft.\n\n\n\"Source\":\n\nAlthough he likely would have been one of the first quarterbacks taken in the 2009 NFL Draft, Bradford decided to return to Oklahoma for his junior season in January 2009. Shortly after the 2009 draft, he was projected as the No. 1 prospect for the 2010 NFL Draft. On October 25, 2009, Bradford announced he would forgo his final year at Oklahoma and enter the draft. Commonly considered one of the top prospects available, Bradford was projected as high as the No. 1 overall pick for most of the preseason and the early part of the regular season.\n\nBecause of his shoulder injury, Bradford did not throw at the 2010 NFL Combine, however he was measured and participated in interviews and medical examinations. He was measured at 6'4¼\" and 236 pounds, about 15 pounds above his college playing weight. Bradford scored 36 out of 50 on the Wonderlic test, well above the average of 28.5 for the 30 NFL quarterbacks slated to start in 2010.\n\nOn March 19, Bradford met with St. Louis Rams general manager Billy Devaney and offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur in Pensacola, Florida, where he had been training and rehabbing since undergoing surgery on his throwing shoulder.\n\nIn early Spring, Bradford met with Thom Goudy, a professional development coach in St. Louis, Missouri. Goudy helped Bradford with his pocket technique. Bradford spent three weeks in his training camp before starting the summer conditioning camp.\nOn April 22, 2010, Bradford was selected by the St. Louis Rams as the first overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. It was the first time the Rams selected a quarterback in the first round of a draft since the selection of Bill Munson in the 1964 NFL Draft. Bradford is the first No. 1 pick out of Oklahoma since Billy Sims was selected top overall by the Detroit Lions in the 1980 NFL Draft. Bradford chose the #8 in honor to Troy Aikman who also attended Oklahoma before transferring to UCLA.\n\nOn July 30, 2010, Bradford signed a six-year, $78 million deal, which has $50 million of guarantees and has a maximum value of $86 million making it the largest contract ever for an NFL rookie.\n\nIn the preseason opener against the Minnesota Vikings on August 14, Bradford went 6-of-13 for 57 yards and was also sacked 3 times in a Rams loss. After another unimpressive showing against the Browns in his second game, Bradford bounced back in a big way against the Patriots in the third game of the preseason. He got his first start in place of the injured A. J. Feeley, throwing two first half touchdowns and helping lead the Rams to a 36–35 victory.\n\nHe competed for the starting quarterback position with Feeley and on September 4, Bradford was named the starting quarterback for the 2010 season opener.\n\nOn September 12, 2010, in his first regular season game as the starting quarterback for the Rams, Bradford completed 32/55 passes for 253 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions in a 17–13 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. His first NFL touchdown came on a 1-yard pass to Laurent Robinson. Two weeks later, he then achieved his first victory as an NFL starter when the Rams defeated the Washington Redskins in an upset by a score of 30–16, which snapped a 13-game overall home losing streak. The next week, he passed for 289 yards and two touchdowns in leading the Rams over the Seahawks, 20-3. This was their first win in a division game since November 2007.\n\nIn Week 8 against the Carolina Panthers, Bradford connected on 25 of 32 passes, two of them for touchdowns. In his first eight games, he scored eleven touchdowns, which tied an NFL record—held by Dan Marino (), Peyton Manning (), and Ben Roethlisberger ()—for over that span by a rookie since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. Bradford went 3-2 as a starter in October, passing for 1,019 yards and 7 touchdowns against 3 interceptions. He was named the NFL's offensive rookie of the month.\n\nDuring October and November, he established a record for most consecutive passes without an interception for a rookie (169), which ended with an interception by William Moore in a home game against the Atlanta Falcons on November 21. On November 28, 2010, against the Denver Broncos, Bradford became the first rookie in NFL history to pass for at least 300 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions during a road victory. He capped November by becoming the first rookie quarterback to win two consecutive Offensive Rookie of the Month awards.\n\nOn December 26, Bradford surpassed Peyton Manning's record for most completed passes by an NFL rookie quarterback (326). Bradford finished the season with 354 completions out of 590 attempts, surpassing Manning's record of 575 for most attempts by an NFL rookie quarterback. Bradford became just the third rookie quarterback to start all 16 regular season games and pass over 3,000 passing yards, joining Peyton Manning and Matt Ryan.\n\nComing into the 2011 season, expectations were high for the St. Louis Rams and Bradford. After going 4-0 in the preseason, it appeared as if they would be fulfilled, but once the regular season rolled around injuries ravaged the roster. A high ankle sprain bothered Bradford for the majority of the year and he finished with 2,164 passing yards, six touchdowns, and six interceptions. The team went 1–9 in games he appeared in and had a 2–14 record overall.\n\nDuring the off-season, there was much speculation that the Rams would select Heisman Trophy winner and former Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III. But, new head coach, Jeff Fisher instilled hope that Bradford was still the Rams franchise quarterback, solidifying this hope when the Rams later reached a deal with the Washington Redskins for the 2nd overall selection in the 2012 NFL Draft.\nThe Rams weren't expected to make much of a leap following their dismal campaign the year before, but behind strong play by Bradford and rookies stepping up to the challenge, the Rams finished 7-8-1. In Week 2, against the Washington Redskins, he finished with 310 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 31–28 victory. In Week 15, against the Minnesota Vikings, he had 377 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 36–22 loss. Bradford finished the season with career best numbers: 3,702 passing yards, 21 touchdowns compared to 13 interceptions and an 82.6 passer rating to go along with 59.5 completion percentage.\n\nWith all the additions in the off-season, the Rams and Bradford were expected to excel in 2013. The season started off on a positive note with a 27–24 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. In the game, Bradford had 299 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. In the next game against the Atlanta Falcons, he had 352 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception as the Rams fell 31–24. After two losses to the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers, he had 222 passing yards and three touchdowns in a 34–20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. For the second straight game, he threw for three touchdowns in a 38–13 victory over the Houston Texans. However, during the Rams Week 7 game against the Carolina Panthers, Bradford tore his left ACL on a run out of bounds, ending his season. On the 2013 season, Bradford passed for 1,687 yards and 14 touchdowns to 4 interceptions and 90.9 passer rating. The Rams missed the playoffs with a 7–9 record.\n\nBradford suffered an injury to the same ACL after being sacked during a preseason game against the Cleveland Browns and missed the entire 2014 season.\n\nOn March 10, 2015, Bradford was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles along with a 2015 fifth round pick, in exchange for Nick Foles, a 2015 fourth-round pick, and a 2016 second-round pick. In his first game as a Philadelphia Eagle, Bradford completed 36 out of 52 passes for a touchdown and two interceptions in a season opening 26–24 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. In Week 4, he threw three touchdowns with zero interceptions, and although his completion percentage was lower than 55% in both games, he still mustered a 122.6 passer rating in a loss to the Redskins, his only passer rating above 90 for the season. In Week 6, he threw three interceptions, but the Eagles still gained a 27–7 win over the New York Giants to move Philadelphia to 3–3 and in first place in the NFC East, mainly thanks to the defense and run game. Bradford had his worst game by far in a loss against the Panthers, where he completed only 56.5% of his passes with zero touchdowns, one interception, and a quarterback rating of 58.7. Against the Miami Dolphins on November 15, Bradford suffered a left shoulder injury as well as a concussion, which would keep him out of the next two games against Tampa Bay and a Thanksgiving Day game against Detroit In his first season, Bradford would go 7-7 as a starter and his play began to improve after Week 9 against the Dallas Cowboys. During Week 9, Bradford threw a game-winning touchdown in overtime to Jordan Matthews. In Week 13, Bradford led the Eagles to a 35–28 upset over the New England Patriots. In Week 15, Bradford threw for 361 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in a 40–17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. In Week 16, he threw for 380 yards and a touchdown in a 38–24 loss to the Washington Redskins. In the regular season finale against the New York Giants, he threw for 320 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the 35–30 victory. The Eagles finished with a 7–9 record and missed the playoffs.\n\nOn March 1, 2016, Bradford signed a 2-year, $36 million ($26 million guaranteed) contract extension with the Eagles. However, the Eagles traded with the Cleveland Browns for the number two pick in the 2016 NFL draft, in order to draft a new quarterback. This led to speculation that Bradford would be traded or used as a stopgap while Chase Daniel educates the newly drafted quarterback in Pederson's offensive scheme. On April 25, 2016, it was reported that Bradford wanted to be traded and that he would no longer attend the team's off-season activities. The Eagles selected quarterback Carson Wentz with the second overall pick in the 2016 draft on April 28. Bradford returned to the team in May 2016.\n\nOn September 3, 2016, following his appearance in the Eagles' preseason matches, Bradford was traded to the Minnesota Vikings for a first-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft (later used to select Derek Barnett) and a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. The trade was made after Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater suffered a season-ending ACL tear during team practice on August 30, 2016.\n\n15 days after being traded, Bradford made his first start for the Vikings in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers. Despite not having much time to learn the offense, Bradford outplayed Aaron Rodgers but ended up hurting his left hand in the first half due to a hit by Clay Matthews. Bradford finished the game completing 22-of-31 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns, helping lead the Vikings to their first win in their new stadium. His first touchdown as a Viking came in the second quarter on an eight-yard pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph in the back of the end zone, while the second touchdown of the night was a 25-yarder to Stefon Diggs late in the third quarter that gave the Vikings a 17-7 lead. The connection between both players resulted in 182 yards on 9 catches for Diggs, a career-high for him. Bradford received high praise from the media, with many calling it one of the best games of his career. The following week, Bradford threw for 171 yards and one touchdown in a 22-10 win against the Carolina Panthers, thanks to a strong Vikings' defense that sacked Cam Newton eight times and intercepted him three times. In the Vikings' win over the New York Giants in Week 4, Bradford threw a touchdown pass and did not throw an interception for the third straight game. The only other Vikings player to do that in each of his first three games of a season was Randall Cunningham in 1998. With both starting tackles and Stefon Diggs (Vikings' leading receiver) out for a Week 5 game against the Houston Texans, Bradford delivered another strong performance, completing 22 of 30 passes for 271 yards, two touchdowns and, for the fourth straight start, not a single interception. In the opening drive, he connected with Adam Thielen on a 36-yard touchdown strike.\n\nDuring a three-game losing streak, Bradford threw only three touchdowns and an interception with 725 yards and a 66% completion percentage, poor in comparison with the previous four games, in which he threw for 990 yards, six touchdowns, no interceptions, and had a 70% completion percentage. The Vikings would finish the season with an 8-8 record.\n\nBradford started 15 games in 2016, completing 395 of 552 passes for 3,877 yards and 20 touchdowns with 5 interceptions. His 71.6 completion percentage set a single season NFL record, passing Drew Brees's 2011 mark of 71.2. Brees later finished the 2017 season with a 72.0 completion percentage, retaking the record. Bradford's 395 completions set a franchise record for completions in a season.\n\nIn Week 1, on \"Monday Night Football\", Bradford completed 27-of-32 pass attempts for 346 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 29–19 win over the New Orleans Saints, earning him his first NFC Offensive Player of the Week award. He was inactive for the Week 2 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers due to a knee injury. After missing three more games, on October 10, it was revealed that Bradford was diagnosed with wear and tear on his knee after two previous ACL surgeries. On November 7, Bradford underwent a knee scope, putting his season in jeopardy. He was placed on injured reserve the next day, ending his season. On January 13, 2018, Bradford was activated off injured reserve to the active roster for the divisional round of the playoffs against the New Orleans Saints, however Case Keenum started the game due to his strong season.\n\nOn March 16, 2018, Bradford signed a two-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals worth up to $20 million the first year with $15 million guaranteed with a potential out after 2018. Bradford wore number 9 with the Cardinals, due to number 8 having been retired in honor of Hall of Fame safety Larry Wilson. After ineffective performances in the first two games, both blowout losses, Bradford was pulled in favor of rookie Josh Rosen in the final moments of a Week 3 loss to the Chicago Bears. As the Cardinals decided to keep Rosen as their starting quarterback, Bradford inactive for the next five weeks before ultimately being released on November 3, 2018. \n\n\n\n\nBradford is 1/16th Cherokee and is listed as an official citizen on the Cherokee Nation tribe's rolls. Bradford was the first person of identified Cherokee descent to start at quarterback for a Division I university since Sonny Sixkiller, a full-blooded Cherokee, who played for the University of Washington during the 1970–1972 seasons.\n\nHis father, Kent Bradford, was an offensive lineman for the Sooners from 1977 to 1978.\n\nBradford is an avid ice hockey fan. His favorite team is the Vancouver Canucks. Bradford is a scratch golfer and was also a basketball player in high school.\n\nBradford, a born-again Christian, appeared in a short film of video testimonials from celebrities called I Am Second, sharing his faith about Christianity and winning the Heisman Trophy.\n\nIn 2009, Oklahoma City mayor Mick Cornett declared January 13 as \"Sam Bradford Day\" in Oklahoma City.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20411166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20411166", "title": "Sea Hag", "text": "Sea Hag\n\nThe Sea Hag is a fictional character owned by King Features Syndicate. She is a tall, masculine looking witch featured in comics/cartoons as a nemesis to the character Popeye. The Sea Hag was created by Elzie Crisler Segar in 1929 as part of the \"Thimble Theatre\" comic strip.\n\nThe Sea Hag is one of the central enemies of Popeye the Sailor. She is the last witch on earth, and a pirate who sails the Seven Seas in her ship \"The Black Barnacle.\" She has a headquarters on Plunder Island, where she keeps a pride of lions that she uses to dispatch her enemies. She also has a deep knowledge of magic artifacts, and has used many of them to great effect over the years. She is able to practice Voodoo magic and powerful enough to capture the equally magical Eugene the Jeep (though in the 1961 cartoon, \"Myskery Melody,\" she declares her magic is powerless against him, and is subsequently shown running as Eugene attacks her with magical electricity from his tail), and on one occasion Santa Claus. She can even alter her appearance to that of her alter ego, \"Rose of the Sea.\" The Sea Hag has a pet vulture named Bernard as her familiar. Bernard is abnormally strong and can easily carry a human in flight. The Sea Hag also commands an army of Goons. The most famous of the Goons is Alice the Goon.\n\nBecause she is a woman, Popeye cannot physically attack her. His honor says that he would never hit a woman, even someone as evil as the Sea Hag. In such cases, it is Olive Oyl herself who steps in and does physical damage to her. One notable exception to this is in the 1960s cartoon, \"Old Salt Tale\" where Popeye grabs her whip and uses it to fling her into the sea. However this is during a story being told by Popeye, and therefore is not technically him.\n\nUpon meeting Popeye, she falls madly in love with him. Discovering that Popeye already has a girlfriend named Olive Oyl she tries her best to be rid of Olive and win Popeye over to her favor. Popeye makes it clear to her though that under no circumstances would he be interested in a relationship with her. Enraged, on one occasion she gave Popeye's archenemy Brutus a potion to become young and handsome as a means to win Olive Oyl's heart. Later after thinking that the Sea Hag had died, Popeye had this to say once he discovered that she wasn't: \"I yam glad she ain't dead even if she is a exter bad woman. If they wasn't no bad women, maybe we wouldn't appreciate the good ones. Anyway, she yam what she yam!\" Despite this, the Sea Hag has tried to kill Popeye on occasion when upset that Popeye remains uninterested in her romantically.\n\n"}

While young, Edmond won the Hong Kong city boxing championship. He attended York University from 1982 to 1984, studying pre-medicine. In 1984 he was accepted as a medical student at the University of Toronto.\n\nIn 1985, police arrested Yu and took him to the Clark Institute of Psychiatry, where he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nOn February 20, 1997, Yu assaulted a woman at a bus stop, then boarded a bus. Police attempted to board the bus, at which point Yu, according to witnesses, raised a small hammer. Constable Lou Pasquino fired six shots, hitting Yu three times.\n\nAn official inquest in 1998–1999 cleared the police of wrongdoing and resulted in a number of recommendations.

{"id": "20732356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20732356", "title": "Talut", "text": "Talut\n\nTalut (, \"Ṭālūt\") is considered to be the Qur’anic name for Saul, as he was the \"Malik\" (, King) of Israel, or Gideon, with the reasoning that the Quran references the same incident of the drinking from the river as that found in the Book of Judges (7:5-7), and other factors associated with the latter.\n\nThe name 'Tālūt' has uncertain etymology. Unlike some other Quranic figures, the Arabic name is not similar to the Hebrew name (\"Sha'ul\"). According to Muslim exegetes, the name 'Tālūt' means 'Tall' (from the Arabic \"tūl\") and refers to the extraordinary stature of Saul, which would be consistent with the Biblical account. In explanation of the name, exegetes such as Tha'labi hold that at this time, the future King of Israel was to be recognised by his height; Samuel set up a measure, but no one in Israel reached its height except Tālūt (Saul).\n\nIsraelites demanded a King after the time of Musa (Moses), to lead them into war against their foes. Talut was chosen by the Prophet Samuel (not mentioned by name explicitly, but rather as \"a Prophet\" of the Israelites) announced that Allah chose Talut as their King. The Israelites questioned Samuel about this, lacking respect for Talut as he was not wealthy. Samuel then told them that Talut was more favored than they were. He was distinguished by the greatness of his knowledge and of his physique. A sign of his role as King was that God brought back the Ark of the Covenant for Israel. Talut tested his people at a river; whoever drank from it would not follow him in battle excepting one who took from it in \"the hollow of the hand.\" Many drank, and only the faithful ventured on. Talut led the Israelites to victory over the army of Goliath, who was killed by Dawud (David). Talut is not considered as a \"Nabi\" (, Prophet), but a Divinely appointed King. The Quranic account differs from the Biblical account (if Saul is assumed to be Talut) in that in the Bible, the Sacred Ark was returned to Israel before Saul's accession, and the test by drinking water is made in the Hebrew Bible not by Saul, but by Gideon.\n\nTalut is also mentioned in a \"hadith\" (, 'narration'): \"Narrated Al-Bara: The companions of Muhammad, who took part in Badr, told me that their number was that of Talut's companions who crossed the river (of Jordan) with him, and they were over three-hundred-and-ten men. By Allah, none crossed the river with him, but a believer.\"\n\n"}

There is speculation that he or his band had Navajo kinship ties and was known among the Navajo as \"he who checks his horse\". Victorio's sister was the famous woman warrior Lozen, or the \"Dextrous Horse Thief\".\n\nIn 1853 he was considered a chief or sub-chief by the United States Army and signed a document. In his twenties, he rode with Mangas Coloradas, leader of the Coppermine band of the Tchihendeh people and principal leader of the whole Tchihendeh Apache division (who took him as his son-in-law), and Cuchillo Negro, leader of the Warm Springs band of the Tchihendeh people and second principal leader of the whole Tchihendeh Apache division, as well as did Nana, Delgadito, Cochise, Juh, Geronimo and other Apache leaders. As was the custom, he became the leader of a large mixed band of Mimbreños and Mescaleros (led by his friend – and probably brother-in-law as husband of another daughter of Mangas Coloradas, as well the same Cochise – Caballero) and fought against the United States Army.\n\nFrom 1870 to 1880, Victorio, chief of the Coppermine Mimbreños and principal leader of all the Tchihende, along with Loco, chief of the Warm Spring Mimbreños and second-ranking among the Tchihende, were moved to and left at least three different reservations, some more than once, despite their bands' request to live on traditional lands. Victorio, Loco and the Mimbreños were moved to San Carlos Reservation in Arizona Territory in 1877. Victorio and his followers (including old Nana) left the reservation twice, seeking and temporarily obtaining hospitality in Fort Stanton Reservation among their Sierra Blanca and Sacramento Mescalero allies and relatives (Caballero was probably Victorio's brother-in-law and Mangus' uncle, San Juan was too an old friend and Nana's wife was a Mescalero woman), before they came back to Ojo Caliente only to leave permanently in late August 1879, which started Victorio's War. Despite Nautzili's efforts, many Northern Mescalero warriors, led by Caballero and Muchacho Negro, joined him with their families, and San Juan and other Mescaleros also left their reservation; many Guadalupe and Limpia Mescalero too (Carnoviste and Alsate were close allies to Victorio after 1874) joined Victorio's people. Victorio was successful at raiding and evading capture by the military, and won a significant engagement at Las Animas Canyon on September 18 1879.\nWithin a few months Victorio led an impressive series of other brilliant fights against troops of the 9th, 10th and 6th U.S. Cavalry near the Percha River (Rio Puerco) (January 1 1880), in the San Mateos Mountains (January 17 1880) and in the Cabello Mountains near the Animas Creek (January 30, 1880), and again near Aleman's Wells, San Andres Mountains west of White Sands, (February 2 1880), then again in the San Andres Mountains (perhaps near Victorio’s Peak) routing the cavalrymen and chasing them to the Rio Grande (February 9th1889), then (April 4 1880) at Hembrillo Canyon, San Andres Mountains. In April 1880, Victorio was credited with leading the Alma Massacre – a raid on United States settlers' homes around Alma, New Mexico. During this event, 41 settlers were killed. Victorio's warriors were finally driven off by the arrival of American soldiers from Fort Bayard. However, Victorio continued his campaign with the attack on Fort Tularosa, where his warriors had to face a detachment (K troop) of the 9th Cavalry and were repulsed by the \"Buffalo Soldiers\" after a harsh fight. Victorio's camp near the Rio Palomas, in the Black Range, was surprised and attacked on May 23–25, 1880, but the Mimbreños and Mescaleros succeeded in repulsing the soldiers. After the Rio Palomas battle, Victorio went on some raids to Mexico repeatedly fording the Rio Grande, after having been intercepted and beaten off, with a 60 warriors' party, at Quitman Canyon (July 30, 1880). Chased by more than 4.000 armed men (9th, 10th, 6th U.S. Cavalry, 15th U.S. Infantry, Texas Rangers) Victorio fooled all of them during more than one month.\nOn August 9, 1880 Victorio and his band attacked a stagecoach and mortally wounded retired Major General James J. Byrne.\n\nIn October 1880, while moving along the Rio Grande in north-eastern Chihuahua (a land well-known to the Guadalupe and Limpia Southern Mescaleros), having sent Nana and Mangus to raid for food and ammunition, Victorio, with only a few warriors and even less ammunition, and his band were surrounded and killed by soldiers of the Mexican Army under Colonel Joaquin Terrazas in the Battle of Tres Castillos ().\n\nAn 1886 appendix for Papers Relating to the Foreign Nations of the United States states that, contemporaneously, the Tarahumara Scout credited with killing Victorio in 1880 was Mauricio Corredor. Apache lore states that Victorio actually committed suicide with a knife rather than face capture, historians such as Kathleen Chamberlain note that the Mexicans at the battle could not identify which body was Victorio's.\n\n\n\nLehmann, Hermann. \"Nine Years with the Indians.\" See also, \"A New Look at Nine Years with the Indians.\"\n\n\n"}

He was president of the Writers' Association of South Africa, which later became the Black Media Workers Association of South Africa (or Mwasa), and he led a year-long strike in 1980 for fair wages for black journalists. He was a victim of the Apartheid-era government in South Africa and was imprisoned at least three times for his journalism. After Apartheid ended, he became the chief executive officer of the South African Broadcast Corporation.\n\nZwelakhe Sisulu's family is well known for its struggle against Apartheid in South Africa. He was the son of anti-Apartheid activists and African National Congress members Walter Sisulu and Albertina Sisulu. He was the brother of Max Sisulu, Speaker of the National Assembly, and Lindiwe Sisulu, Minister of Public Service and Administration. His father was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 when Zwelakhe Sisulu was 13 years old.\n\nSisulu and his wife Zodwa had 2 sons and 1 daughter.\n\nZwelakhe Sisulu began his career in journalism in 1975 when he worked as an intern for South African Associated Newspapers. He then became a journalist for \"The Rand Daily Mail\" where he covered the Soweto uprising in 1976 and remained there until 1978. He was news editor of the \"Sunday Post\" (South Africa) until his ban in 1980. While at the \"Sunday Post\", he was sentenced to prison for his refusal to reveal information about sources of one of his reporters and he led a 1980 strike which resulted in his ban from journalism for several years. After his house arrest, he was a Nieman Fellow. After his fellowship was complete in 1985, he worked for \"Sowetan\". In 1986, he founded the \"New Nation\" (defunct since 30 May 1997), before he was arrested by police and held without a trial as part of the emergency and mass arrests in South Africa at the time. The newspaper was editorially aligned with the African National Congress, which stated on its masthead: \"The media of the powerless.\" At the time it was South Africa's largest black newspaper. After his release from a 2-year detention and after the ban was lifted on the ANC, Sisulu served as Nelson Mandela's press secretary and also the director of information of the African National Congress.\n\nIn post-Apartheid South Africa, Sisulu became the head of the South African Broadcast Corporation in 1994.\n\nAfter his stint at SABC, Sisulu founded New African Investments Limited, which is known as the first black-owned business on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and black empowerment. Holdings of the company include the publishing house David Philip, Soweto TV and Primedia Broadcasting.\n\nZwelakhe Sisulu walked a fine line between journalism and activism already while at \"The Rand Daily Mail\". In 1977, he became president of the Writers' Association of South Africa. As president, he led a march with his fellow black journalists and then was briefly jailed. Sisulu's editor admonished him for his explanation that he was making use of his freedom of assembly. His editor told him, \"You don't march, you write.\"\n\nSisulu first came to international attention in a case involving the surveillance of black journalists. While an editor at the \"Sunday Post\" in 1979, Sisulu was questioned by authorities about his knowledge of a source used by journalist Thamsanqa Gerald Mkhwanazi. Sisulu was sentenced for nine months in prison for refusing to co-operate. For the first time, police acknowledged in his case the practice of using wiretaps on a journalists' telephones, which had been widely suspected.\n\nZwelakhe Sisulu was the leader of the union during Mwasa's strike for fair wages for black journalists in 1980. It was the first strike by black journalists. After the strike was over, he lost his job, was banned from journalism, and ordered under house arrest for three years until 1983. Zwelakhe Sisulu's arrest on 30 June 1981 was attributed to the Internal Security Act. Other leaders who shared the same fate were Phil Mtimkhulu, Mathatha Tsedu, Subri Govende and Joe Thloloe.\n\nHe was a Nieman Fellow from 1984–1985.\n\nZwelakhe Sisulu was arrested twice in 1986.\n\nPolice swept him away from his home for the first time on 27 June 1986. Sisulu later called them \"armed bandits.\" The government announced his detention one week later. There were calls from abroad to release him, such as one from the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE). He was released on 18 July 1986.\n\nZwelakhe Sisulu had already been appointed director of the Board for a new organisation ARTICLE 19 at the time of his second arrest 12 December 1986. He was detained at John Vorster Square where other activists were also imprisoned. The organization made his case its first campaign. He was released after two years but not allowed to continue his work as a journalist. Years later, he stated his belief that the publicity of organisations like ARTICLE 19 during the time of his imprisonment saved his life.\n\nHe was the CEO of the South African Broadcasting Corporation from September 1994 to 1997. Under Sisulu's leadership in a democratic South Africa, the SABC was reorganized and relaunched 4 February 1996. A controversy was created over the redistribution of resources for other languages besides Afrikaans, which had received special privileges under the Apartheid system.\n\nLater, Sisulu was appointed as a commissioner to investigate censorship at the SABC that had been alleged by whistleblower John Perlman.\n\nSisulu was awarded an Order of Mapungubwe - Gold, posthumously for \"his exceptional contribution to quality journalism; and as a reporter exposing the cruelties of apartheid and encouraging unity among the people of different political persuasions to fight for liberation.\")\n\n\n"}
