The only suspects were David Cullen Bain, the oldest son and only survivor, and Robin Bain, the father. David Bain, aged 22, was charged with five counts of murder. In May 1995, he was convicted on each of the five counts and sentenced to mandatory life in prison with a minimum non-parole period of sixteen years.\n\nBain's case was taken up by businessman and former rugby player Joe Karam. In 2007, Bain's legal team, guided by Karam, successfully appealed to the Privy Council, which declared there had been a 'substantial miscarriage of justice'. Bain was released on bail in May 2007. The retrial in June 2009 ended with his acquittal on all charges.\n\nSpeculation about the case continued long after Bain was acquitted, including whether or not he should receive compensation for the years he spent in prison. Canadian jurist Ian Binnie was appointed in November 2011 to review the circumstances and advise the government on whether compensation should be paid. Binnie concluded that the Dunedin police made 'egregious errors' and that the 'extraordinary circumstances' in the case justified the payment of compensation. This report was rejected by the Minister of Justice, on advice from High Court Judge Robert Fisher.\n\nIn March 2015, the government appointed Ian Callinan, a retired justice of the High Court of Australia, to conduct a second review of Bain's compensation claim. Callinan's report, in which he concluded that Bain was not innocent on the balance of probabilities, was delivered to the Minister of Justice on 26 January 2016. The Minister announced that no compensation would be paid, but that Bain would be given an \"ex gratia\" payment of $925,000 if he agreed to stop all further legal action.\n\nRobin Irving Bain and Margaret Arawa Cullen were married in 1969 in Dunedin, New Zealand. They had four children: David (born 1972), Arawa (1974), Laniet (1976) and Stephen (1980). In 1974, they moved to Papua New Guinea, where Robin worked as a missionary teacher. The family returned to New Zealand in 1988. Three years after his return, Robin became the principal of Taieri Beach School, a two-teacher school about 50 kilometres down the coast from Dunedin.\n\nIn June 1994, the family lived at 65 Every Street, Andersons Bay, Dunedin. The house was old and 'semi-derelict'. At this time Robin and Margaret were estranged. Robin was initially sleeping in the back of his van at Taieri, but more recently in the schoolhouse three nights a week. He returned to the family home at weekends but slept in a caravan in the back garden. David was studying music and classics at Otago University and had a part-time job delivering morning newspapers. Arawa was attending a teachers' training college and Stephen was at high school. Laniet had a part-time job in Dunedin and lived away from home, but had returned to the family residence on the Sunday evening of 19 June to attend a family meeting.\n\nOn the morning of 20 June 1994, David Bain called the 111 emergency number at 7:09 am in a distressed state and told the operator: \"They're all dead, they're all dead.\" When the police arrived they found five members of the Bain family had been shot to death – Robin (58), his wife Margaret (50), their daughters Arawa (19) and Laniet (18), and their son Stephen (14). There was evidence of a violent struggle involving Stephen, who was partly strangled as well as shot. A message was found typed on a computer that said \"sorry, you are the only one who deserved to stay\". Four days later, David, aged 22, was charged with five counts of murder.\n\nBain's first trial lasted three weeks and took place at the Dunedin High Court in May 1995. The Crown put forward that Bain shot to death his mother, two sisters and brother in undetermined order before going on his morning paper run. On his return he waited for his father to come in from the caravan and go into the lounge to pray and then shot him from behind the computer alcove curtain, typed the message on the computer, arranged the scene to make it look like a suicide, and called 111. The defence submitted that Robin killed the other family members, typed the message and shot himself while David was out on his paper round.\n\nBain testified that after his morning paper run he entered the house without turning on the lights, and went downstairs to the bathroom where he washed his hands, which were covered with black newsprint, and put some clothes in the washing machine. Bain said that he noticed bullets and the trigger lock of his rifle on the floor of his bedroom when he went back upstairs and turned on the light. He found his mother dead in her room, heard Laniet gurgling and found his father dead in the lounge. At 7.09 a.m. he rang 111 in great distress.\n\nIn his closing address, Crown Prosecutor W J Wright said that Bain murdered his family to gain his inheritance, which the parents had put aside for the new house. In summing up, Justice Neil Williamson told the jury that the Crown had said \"... that these events were so bizarre and abnormal that it was impossible for the human mind to conceive of any logical or reasonable explanation\".\n\nLittle in the way of motive was presented for Robin. In a formal statement, Dean Cottle told police that Laniet had confided in him that her father had been having an incestuous relationship with her and that she was planning to \"blow the whistle\" the weekend before she and her family were killed. Cottle failed to show up at court when called, and when he did turn up, Justice Williamson found him unreliable as a witness and ruled against admission of his testimony. The defence instead submitted that, \"Robin was a proud school teacher who had been rejected by his family and had snapped after months of pressure.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the trial, Bain was convicted by the jury on five counts of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a sixteen-year non-parole period.\n\nFormer All Black rugby player Joe Karam felt \"something was wrong\" with the case and spearheaded a lengthy campaign to have Bain's convictions overturned. He visited Bain in prison over 200 times and wrote four books about the case. Karam stated in his books that \"[David's] innocence is the only possible conclusion\" and that he was 'totally innocent'. He was subsequently described in the media as a 'freedom fighter' and his support helped bring about a retrial in 2009.\n\nThe first application was made to the New Zealand Court of Appeal in 1995, principally on whether the trial judge had erred in refusing to admit Cottle's testimony. The Court refused to hear the appeal on the grounds that the \"Crown case appeared very strong and the defence theory not at all plausible.\" In June 1998, Bain petitioned the Governor-General for a pardon, which was then passed onto the Ministry of Justice. In 2000, Justice Minister Phil Goff said the investigation had shown that 'a number of errors' may have occurred in the Crown's case against Bain. The case was then referred to the Court of Appeal for a full hearing in 2003. The court heard submissions over five days, but was not persuaded that there had been a miscarriage of justice and the appeal was dismissed on 15 December 2003.\n\nIn March 2007, Bain's legal team, including Karam, travelled to London to lay out nine arguments before the Privy Council as to why his convictions should be quashed. Two of the nine points concerned Robin's mental state and possible motive. The other seven points concerned questions about particular pieces of evidence. The Privy Council found that many of these issues were highly contentious and the jury could well have been influenced by them. The Privy Council concluded that: \"In the opinion of the board, the fresh evidence adduced in relation to the nine points ... taken together, compels the conclusion that a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred in this case.\" The Privy Council quashed Bain's convictions and ordered a retrial, but noted that he should remain in custody in the mean time.\n\nOn 15 May 2007, Bain was granted bail by the High Court in Christchurch. Justice Fogarty said that under New Zealand law, there was no reason for continued detention and he was bailed to the home of his longtime supporter Karam. Altogether, he served almost thirteen years of a life sentence with a minimum sixteen-year non-parole period.\n\nThe retrial took place at the Christchurch High Court, with the jury sworn in on 6 March 2009, and Bain pleaded not guilty to the five murder charges. \nThe defence argued that Robin committed the murders and then committed suicide. The trial lasted about three months and the jury took less than a day to find Bain not guilty on all five charges. Outside court, an emotional Bain thanked his supporters, particularly Karam. \"Without Joe and his solid strength ... I wouldn't have made it through this far\", Bain said. Karam said the trial would go down as the \"criminal trial of New Zealand’s history\". Some commentators questioned the behaviour of jurors who hugged Bain and attended a \"victory party\" after the verdict. Chris Gallavin, a senior law lecturer at Canterbury University, said, \"While this is unusual behaviour, the whole case is an unusual case.\"\n\nAfter the retrial, New Zealand's Chief Coroner consulted with the local coroner and others to decide whether to conduct inquests into the deaths, as the verdict implied the death certificates may not be accurate. However no inquests were held; a Law Society spokesman pointed out that even if the coroner's findings disagreed with the retrial verdict, this could not lead to any further legal action against Bain.\n\nIn March 2010, Bain lodged an application for compensation for wrongful imprisonment. His case fell outside Cabinet rules on compensation, meaning the government was not obliged to pay him anything, but may do so if he was able to establish his innocence on \"the balance of probabilities\" and was also considered to be the \"victim of exceptional circumstances\".\n\nBecause of the high-profile nature of the case, Justice Minister Simon Power chose an overseas judge – retired Canadian Supreme Court Justice Ian Binnie – to examine Bain's application for compensation. After a year-long investigation, Binnie concluded in September 2012 that \"on the balance of probabilities\" Bain was innocent of the murders in 1994 and should be paid compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment\". By the time Binnie's report was completed, Simon Power had retired from Parliament. Judith Collins, the new Justice Minister, disagreed with Binnie's conclusions and sought feedback from the police, the Solicitor-General and former High Court judge Robert Fisher.\n\nFisher concluded that Binnie had made significant errors of principle and recommended that a new report should be undertaken. He acknowledged that a new report could still reach the same conclusion as Binnie. Collins agreed and said another report into Bain's compensation claim would have to be commissioned. Binnie took exception to the criticisms of his report, arguing that he had weighed up the totality of the evidence both for and against Bain. He said the government was clearly 'shopping around' for a report that would allow it to dodge paying compensation.\n\nIn January 2013, Bain filed a claim in the High Court seeking a review of Collins' actions, alleging Collins had breached natural justice and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act. In August 2014, Collins resigned and Amy Adams was appointed as the new Justice Minister. The judicial review proceedings against Collins were discontinued in January 2015. Another report was commissioned and retired Australian judge Ian Callinan was given the responsibility to draft it.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, Adams formally announced that Callinan had found that Bain was not innocent \"on the balance of probabilities\", and as a result the government would not be making an apology or compensating Bain for wrongfully spending thirteen years in prison. Adams also said that Bain's legal team had indicated that they would have mounted a legal challenge against Callinan's report and that while the Crown was confident in the strength of its position no one benefited from the matter continuing to drag on. The Crown therefore agreed to make an ex gratia payment of $925,000 in recognition of the time and expenses incurred by Bain during the compensation process and the desirability of avoiding further litigation.\n\nThe majority of respondents to opinion polls conducted in 2012, 2013 and 2015 thought Bain should receive compensation for the time he spent in prison.\n\nThe total cost to the taxpayer of the Bain case was nearly $7 million. The 2009 retrial cost more than $4 million, making it the most expensive trial in New Zealand history.\n\nFollowing his acquittal, Bain undertook a three-month European holiday paid for by his supporters. Ten months later, he was struggling to find work and had no money. Auckland defence lawyer Peter Williams QC said Bain would be suffering from the stigma experienced by ex-prisoners re-entering the workplace. In March 2012, Bain was working for an engineering firm in Auckland. In September 2012, he became engaged to his girlfriend, a Christchurch primary school teacher, and they were married on 10 January 2014. Bain was working for a Christchurch engineering firm at the time his wife gave birth to a baby boy on 3 December 2014. In May 2017, he changed his name by deed poll to William Davies, taking the surname of his wife.\n\nIn June 2017, the Crown began disposing of exhibits used in the trials. Crown Law decided it had no legal grounds on which to retain items belonging to Bain, and his rifle and items of clothing would be returned to him through Karam.\n\nThe jumpers worn by Bain during the original trial, knitted by Margaret Bain to his own designs, became a symbol of the Bain case. During the retrial, T-shirts inspired by the jumpers were sold online. Reflecting the high level of public interest in his case, in 2009, Bain was found by Internet search engine Google to be the most-searched-for New Zealander of the past year.\n\n\"The December Brother\", a 2010 play produced by Tim Spite for Wellington's Downstage Theatre, depicts re-enactments of the Bain family killings. It presents two scenarios – the first with David Bain murdering his family, and the second with his father, Robin Bain, carrying out the killings, then taking his own life. The play was based on the theories put forward by the legal teams for the defence and prosecution during the trials.\n\nA ten-episode podcast covering the case, \"Black Hands\" by Christchurch journalist Martin van Beynen, was launched on 20 July 2017. A one–episode sequel podcast, also written and narrated by van Beynen and in response to a radio interview of former judge Ian Binnie, was released on 17 September 2017.\n\n\n"}

He attended the College of William and Mary and received his medical degree in 1808 from the University of Pennsylvania. Archer married Eloisa Clarke on January 20, 1813; their union produced six children.\nArcher practiced medicine and was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates representing Powhatan County from 1819–1820. Archer was elected as a presidential elector in the United States presidential election, 1820, casting his vote for Virginia's native son, James Monroe (Democratic-Republican). On May 13, 1828, Archer killed his cousin, Dr. James Ottway Crump, in a duel fought with pistols near Scottsville, Virginia, in Powhatan County.\n\nArcher arrived in Texas about 1831, residing in Brazoria County. Archer was an active Mason and helped organize a Masonic Lodge in Brazoria. He was also an outspoken advocate of Texas' independence from Mexico and was elected to represent Brazoria at the Convention of 1833. In October 1835, Archer fought at the Battle of Gonzales which ended in a Mexican withdrawal. The next month he was elected Chairman of the Consultation of 1835, meeting in San Felipe de Austin which formed a provisional government for Texas. Although Archer was a hard-liner in favor of independence, he acceded to the will of the majority which voted to support a return to the Mexican Constitution of 1824.\n\nThe Consultation subsequently elected Archer, along with Stephen F. Austin and William H. Wharton to serve as Commissioners of Texas in the United States. Their purpose was to raise funds, recruit troops and gain support among Americans for the cause of Texas. The trio sailed from Galveston to New Orleans in late December 1835 and moved up the Mississippi River over the next several weeks making speeches to crowds before moving east to Washington, D.C.. While the Commissioners were in Washington, on March 2, 1836, Texas declared its independence from Mexico. The United States refused to recognize the nascent republic at that point.\n\nArcher returned to Texas and was elected to the Texas House of Representatives representing Brazoria. He also supported the election of his former colleague Austin to be President of Texas. Austin died before the election was held and Sam Houston was elected President. In 1837, during the Second Session of the First Congress, Archer was elected Speaker of the Texas House.\n\nWhile in Congress, Archer joined James Collinsworth in sponsoring legislation to\nset up the Texas Railroad, Navigation, and Banking Company. Even though President Houston supported the establishment of the company, it later failed primarily due to its banking provisions and because of public opposition led by President Anson Jones.\n\nIn 1838 – 1839, Archer achieved the position of Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Texas.\n\nDuring the Administration of President Mirabeau B. Lamar, Archer was chosen to serve as Secretary of War from February 1840 until December 13, 1841.\n\nArcher remained politically active throughout his life. He died on September 22, 1856, at Brazoria and was buried at William H. Wharton's Eagle Island Plantation on Oyster Creek in Brazoria County. Archer City and Archer County, Texas, the brig \"Archer\" of the Second Texas Navy were all named in his honor.\n"}

Colombia is a multiethnic society, home to people of various ethnic, religious and national origins. As a result, majority of Colombians do not equate their nationality with their ethnicity, usually embracing and espousing both simultaneously.\n\nThe majority of the Colombian population is made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of Spanish conquest and immigration, different waves of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly six centuries and continue today. Elements of indigenous Amerindian and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Colombia and thus a modern Colombian identity. In this regard, Colombia and Colombians share many cultural similarities with their South American neighbors: Brazilians, Venezuelans and others.\n\nOriginally, Colombia's territory was inhabited entirely by Amerindian groups. Colombia's indigenous cultures evolved from three main groups—the Quimbayas, who inhabited the western slopes of the Cordillera Central; the Chibchas; and the Kalina (Caribs). The Muisca culture, a subset of the larger Chibcha ethnic group and famous for their use of gold, were responsible for the legend of El Dorado. Today indigenous people comprise roughly 3.4% of the population in Colombia. More than fifty different indigenous ethnic groups inhabit Colombia. Most of them speak languages belonging to the Chibchan and Cariban language families.\n\nHistorically there are 567 reserves (\"resguardos\") established for indigenous peoples and they are inhabited by more than 800,000 people. The 1991 constitution established that their native languages are official in their territories, and most of them have bilingual education systems teaching both native languages and Spanish. Some of the largest indigenous groups are the Wayuu, the Arhuacos, the Muisca, the Kuna people, the Witoto, the Páez, the Tucano and the Guahibo. The departaments (\"departamentos)\" with the biggest indigenous population are Cauca, La Guajira and Nariño.\n\nEstimates of the mestizo population in Colombia vary widely, as Colombia's national census does not distinguish between white and mestizo Colombians. According to the 2005 census, the mestizo and white population combined make up approximately 85.9% of the Colombian population, but there is no official estimate of the mestizo population exclusively. Among Colombians, people with mestizo skin tones are sometimes referred to as \"\"trigueños/as”\".\n\nWhite Colombians are primarily descended from European immigrants, who were primarily Spanish settlers, and a small number of other Europeans who arrived during the 19th and 20th centuries. These migrations primarily brought Irish, English, Scottish, Dutch, German, Swiss, Danish, Norwegian, French and Italian, and North Americans immigrants, who migrated to the Caribbean region. There are smaller numbers of Polish, Lithuanian, Czech, Croatian and Serbian communities that immigrated during the Second World War and the Cold War.\n\nMany Colombians are descended from Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Palestine, who moved to Colombia to escape the repression of the Turkish Ottoman Empire and/or financial hardships. When they were first processed in Colombia's [ports, they were classified as \"Turks\". It is estimated that Colombia has a Lebanese population of 700,000 direct descendants and 1,500,000 who have partial ancestry. Most Syrian-Lebanese immigrants established themselves in the Caribbean Region of Colombia in the towns of Santa Marta, Lorica, Fundación, Aracataca, Ayapel, Calamar, Ciénaga, Cereté, Montería and Barranquilla near the basin of the Magdalena River. Many Arab-Colombians adapted their names and surnames to the Spanish language to assimilate more quickly in their communities. Some Colombian surnames of Arab origin include: Guerra (originally Harb), Domínguez (Ñeca), Durán (Doura), Lara (Larach), Cristo (Salibe), among other surnames.\n\nThe majority of Asian Colombians are descended from China, India, Japan, and Korea. \nDuring 1928, Japanese families settled in Valle del Cauca where they came as farmers to grow crops. Then in 1970 to 1980, it was estimated that there were over 6,000 Chinese in the country. Their current communities are found in Bogota, Barranquilla, Cali, Cartagena, Medellin, Santa Marta, Manizales, Cucuta and Pereira. Other Asian groups include Indians, Koreans, and Filipinos are minor but significant.\n\n10.6% of Colombians are full black African or mulatto (of mixed black African and European ancestry). Black Africans were brought as slaves, mostly to the coastal lowlands, beginning early in the 16th century, and continuing into the 19th century.\n\nBecause of its strategic location Colombia has received several immigration waves during its history. Most of these immigrants have settled in the Caribbean Coast; Barranquilla (the largest city in the Colombian Caribbean Coast) and other Caribbean cities have the largest population of Lebanese, Italian, French, and Gypsy descendants. There are also important communities of American and Chinese descendants in the Caribbean Coast. Most immigrants are Venezuelans, mostly based in Bogotá, Colombia's capital.\n\nThere are 101 languages listed for Colombia in the Ethnologue database, of which 80 are spoken today as living languages. There are about 500,000 speakers of indigenous languages in Colombia today.\n\nThe educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a preschool academy until age five (\"Educación preescolar\"). Basic education (\"Educación básica\") is compulsory by law. It has two stages: Primary basic education (\"Educación básica primaria\") which goes from first to fifth grade – children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education (\"Educación básica secundaria\"), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education (\"Educación media vocacional\") that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.\n\nAfter the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a high-school diploma is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as a \"bachiller\", because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called \"bachillerato\" (sixth to eleventh grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the ICFES test (now renamed Saber 11) in order to gain access to higher education (\"Educación superior\"). This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies.\n\n\"Bachilleres\" (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university; these programs last up to five years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies), even as much to six to seven years for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed (if required) to practice the career they have chosen. For some professional career programs, students are required to take the Saber-Pro test, in their final year of undergraduate academic education.\n\nPublic spending on education as a proportion of gross domestic product in 2012 was 4.4%. This represented 15.8% of total government expenditure. In 2012, the primary and secondary gross enrolment ratios stood at 106.9% and 92.8% respectively. School-life expectancy was 13.2 years. A total of 93.6% of the population aged 15 and older were recorded as literate, including 98.2% of those aged 15–24.\n\nThe National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%) are Roman Catholic, while a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism). Some 4.7% of the population is atheist or agnostic, while 3.5% claim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians adhere to Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventism and less than 1% adhere to other religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Indigenous religions, Hare Krishna movement, Rastafari movement, Orthodox Catholic Church, and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively.\n\nWhile Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic country by baptism numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees freedom and equality of religion.\n\n"}

He was previously a web backend developer for the London offices of Google. In 2006, he represented the United Kingdom at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in Ljubljana, Slovenia, where he won a silver medal. His experience at the IMO was described in the 2007 BBC Two British television documentary, \"Beautiful Young Minds\", and the 2014 British dramatic film, \"X+Y\" (released in the United States as \"A Brilliant Young Mind\").\n\nLightwing also started to gain fame in China from 2016 onwards, particularly on the website Zhihu, where his articles written in Chinese, covering a broad range of topics had attracted over 170,000 followers within one year.\n\nLightwing grew up in the Lake District, and Warthill, York, England. In 2015, he described that, before the age of nine, he \"had no particular attraction to mathematics. I learnt to read very young, before attending primary school. And I did read all kinds of things—books aimed at children 5–10 years older. At primary school, I read the entire library.\"\n\nAs his education developed, his teachers \"were a little perplexed what to do with me.\" He described how he wasn't learning anything he hadn't already learned and was bullied by one of his teachers who expected him to \"sit under her desk and be ridiculed\" for no apparent reason. The bullying increased after he \"got extremely angry and jumped on top of the desk to denounce her.\"\n\nAfter some intensive personal instruction within a special 'one-to-one' mathematics class with another teacher, he learned that he enjoyed those classes, and stated that, \"before long, I had made my mind up that maths was what I wanted to do.\"\n\nAt home, his mother, Carolyn, who was a maths and science teacher, had researched Asperger syndrome (AS) when he was 16 years of age after reading the 2003 mystery novel \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\", and, later, took him to a diagnostic consultation with University of Cambridge autism researcher and Professor Simon Baron-Cohen FBA who diagnosed Daniel with AS. Parts of the consultation were included in the 2007 BBC Two British television documentary, \"Beautiful Young Minds\".\n\nHis interest in mathematics led him to being recruited as a member of the 2006 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) team where he represented the United Kingdom and won a silver medal in Ljubljana, Slovenia.\n\nHe attended the University of Cambridge where he received a Master of Arts degree in mathematics in 2009, as well as Peking University where he studied computational linguistics. He previously attended York College and St Peter's School, a public school in York.\n\nLightwing's life story was presented in two films. In 2007, the British television documentary \"Beautiful Young Minds\" was broadcast by BBC Two, and described his medal-winning competition at the 2006 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), as well as his connections with China. In 2014, the British dramatic film \"X+Y\" (released in the United States as \"A Brilliant Young Mind\"), starring Asa Butterfield as Nathan Ellis, a character based on Lightwing, was released and portrayed Lightwing's experiences before and during the IMO competition.\n\nLightwing's professional career includes working at Google, and several gambling-related firms, before co-founding the London-based business Castella Research. He was previously a developer for the London offices of Google, and was once recruited part-time as an IT and marketing manager for the Chinese company Greenland Group. He is fluent in speaking Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese.\n\nHis time with Google, however, changed his opinion about workplace socialising. In 2015, he admitted that he had \"a problem with office culture,\" adding that he sometimes wants \"to join in with other people,\" but is too shy, and doesn't know what to say when it isn't work-related.\n\n"}

He was renowned for his images of Scottish, Welsh and Shropshire flora and fauna, in particular butterflies and fungi.\n\nBeath was born in Berlin in 1960 to a military father (Capt DTL Beath SCLI). The family had numerous postings to military camps around the world including Singapore in 1966 and Malaya in 1967 and it is here where he became acquainted with tropical fauna and flora for the first time. A consistent education was difficult owing to numerous family moves and after some unhappy boarding school placements he became a pupil at Shotton Hall in Shropshire in 1973 where he began to flourish intellectually. His appreciation of the natural world at that time is demonstrated in a plant map of the grounds of Shotton Hall (1975). He left Shotton Hall in 1978 and gained entrance to Bridgwater College (then known as Cannington Horticultural College) in Somerset.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Reading in 1987 with a BSc in Botany, Beath went on to study for a PhD in Tropical ecology at the University of Aberdeen between 1989 and 1993. During his post-graduate and post-doctoral period, he travelled extensively through the rainforests of the Old and New World, including several years' experience in West Africa and Central America. It was here that he did much of the research for his papers and articles on the pollination of Amorphophallus johnsonii by Silphidae, the biology and pollination ecology of Araceae in Ghana and spadix heating in African arcaeae.\n\nBeath was diagnosed with autism at the age of four in 1964, thanks to the persistence of his mother who knew he wasn't simply \"retarded\" (as it was expressed in the language of the day). She took him to see Dr Kenneth Soddy and followed his programme for autistic children which emphasised inclusive and stimulating activities with trusted family members such as singing, talking, reading aloud and imaginative play and a reduction in the time he was allowed to spend in solitary activities. Within eighteen months he was speaking and enjoying play with children he knew but remained shy and confused when confronted with children unknown to him or in a setting outside his home. As an adult, he became an advocate for those living with autism and frequently gave talks about his life and living with the syndrome. He was an active participant, supporter and speaker of Autonomy Shropshire (a self-help group based in Shropshire for young people and adults with high ability autism) and Autism Cymru. For several years, he was an advisor to the board on autism spectrum disorders for Autistica.\n\nLike his great uncle Ivo Peters, Beath's main passion in life was photography. His photographic subjects included a wide range of insects (especially beetles, butterflies and moths), amphibians and birds as well as the flora of tropical rainforests, which were the subject of his thesis. He was completely self-taught, and it was when studying for his PhD at The University of Aberdeen that his passion really took off. He joined the university's camera club and started to refine his photographic technique and also developed an interest in photographing Scottish landscapes. In the last decade he had focused photographing the natural landscapes in and around his hometown of Shrewsbury. He was a keen member of the Shropshire Photographic Society and was the club's competition secretary for several years. During 2010 he was commissioned to write a monthly feature about Shropshire photography through the seasons in \"Shropshire Life\" magazine.\n\nBeath died of a heart attack on 14 January 2013 at the age of 52. On the day of his funeral he was announced as the winner of the Travel Photo of the Year competition.\n"}
{"id": "1760994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1760994", "title": "Disciple whom Jesus loved", "text": "Disciple whom Jesus loved\n\nThe phrase \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\" (, \"ho mathētēs hon ēgapā ho Iēsous\") or, in , the disciple beloved of Jesus (, \"hon ephilei ho Iēsous\") is used six times in the Gospel of John, but in no other New Testament accounts of Jesus. John 21:24 states that the Gospel of John is based on the written testimony of this disciple.\n\nSince the end of the first century, the Beloved Disciple has been commonly identified with John the Evangelist. Scholars have debated the authorship of Johannine literature (the Gospel of John, First, Second, and Third Epistles of John, and the Book of Revelation) since at least the third century, but especially since the Enlightenment. The authorship by John the Apostle is rejected by modern scholars.\n\nThe disciple whom Jesus loved is referred to, specifically, six times in John's gospel:\n\nThe other Gospels do not mention anyone in parallel circumstances who could be directly linked to the Beloved Disciple. For example, in , Peter runs to the tomb. Matthew, Mark, and Luke do not mention any one of the 12 disciples having witnessed the crucifixion.\n\nAlso, the New Testament makes two references to an unnamed \"other disciple\" in and , which may be to the same person based on the wording in .\n\nThe closing words of John's Gospel state explicitly concerning the Beloved Disciple, \"It is this disciple who testifies to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true.\"\n\nEusebius writing in the fourth century recorded in his \"Church History\" a letter which he believed to have been written by Polycrates of Ephesus (\"circa\" 130s–196) in the second century. Polycrates believed that John was the one \"who reclined upon the bosom of the Lord\"; suggesting an identification with the Beloved Disciple:\n\nAugustine of Hippo (354 – 430 AD) also believed that John was the Beloved Disciple, in his \"Tractates on the Gospel of John\".\n\nThe assumption that the Beloved Disciple was one of the Twelve Apostles is that he was apparently present at the Last Supper which Matthew and Mark state that Jesus ate with the Twelve. Thus, the most frequent identification is with John the Apostle, who would then be the same as John the Evangelist. Merril F. Unger presents a case for this by a process of elimination.\n\nNevertheless, while some modern academics continue to share the view of Augustine and Polycrates,\na growing number do not believe that John the Apostle wrote the Gospel of John or indeed any of the other New Testament works traditionally ascribed to him, making this linkage of a 'John' to the beloved disciple difficult to sustain.\n\nSome scholars have additionally suggested a homoerotic interpretation of Christ's relationship with the Beloved Disciple, although such a scriptural reading is disputed by others. Tilborg suggests that the portrait in the Gospel of John is \"positively attuned to the development of possibly homosexual behaviour\". However, he cautions that \"in the code ... such imaginary homosexual behaviour is not an expression of homosexuality.\" Meanwhile, Dunderberg has also explored the issue and argues that the absence of accepted Greek terms for \"lover\" and \"beloved\" discounts a purely erotic reading.\n\nThe relationship between Christ and John was certainly interpreted by some as being of a physical erotic nature as early as the 16th century (albeit in a \"heretical\" context) - documented, for example, in the trial for blasphemy of Christopher Marlowe, who was accused of claiming that \"St. John the Evangelist was bedfellow to Christ and leaned always in his bosom, that he used him as the sinners of Sodoma\". In accusing Marlowe of the \"sinful nature\" of homosexual acts, James I of England inevitably invited comparisons to his own erotic relationship with the Duke of Buckingham which he also compared to that of the Beloved Disciple. Finally, Calcagno, a monk of Venice faced trial and was executed in 1550 for claiming that \"St. John was Christ's catamite\".\n\nDynes also makes a link to the modern day where in 1970s New York a popular religious group was established called the \"Church of the Beloved Disciple\", with the intention of giving a positive reading of the relationship to support respect for same-sex love.\n\nThe Beloved Disciple has also been identified with Lazarus of Bethany, based on :\nand \nAlso relevant according to Ben Witherington III is the fact that the character of the Beloved Disciple is not mentioned before the raising of Lazarus (Lazarus being raised in John 11, while the Beloved Disciple is first mentioned in John 13).\n\nFrederick Baltz asserts that the Lazarus identification, the evidence suggesting that the Beloved Disciple was a priest, and the ancient John tradition are all correct. Baltz says the family of the children of Boethus, known from Josephus and rabbinic literature, is the same family we meet in the 11th chapter of the Gospel: Lazarus, Martha, and Mary of Bethany. This is a beloved family, according to . The historical Lazarus was Eleazar son of Boethus, who was once Israel’s high priest, and from a clan that produced several high priests. The Gospel’s author, John, was not a member of the Twelve, but the son of Martha (Sukkah 52b). He closely matches the description given by Bishop Polycrates in his letter, a sacrificing priest who wore the petalon (i.e., emblem of the high priest). This John \"the Elder\" was a follower of Jesus referred to by Papias of Hierapolis, and an eyewitness to his ministry. He was the right age to have lived until the time of Trajan (according to Irenaeus). Baltz says John is probably the disciple ον ηγαπα ο Ιησους, and Eleazar is the disciple ον εφιλει ο Ιησους in the Gospel.\n\nAnother school of thought has proposed that the Beloved Disciple in the Gospel of John really was originally Mary Magdalene. To make this claim and maintain consistency with scripture, the theory is suggested that Mary's separate existence in the two common scenes with the Beloved Disciple is due to later modifications, hastily done to authorize the Gospel in the late 2nd century. Both scenes are claimed to have inconsistencies both internally and in reference to the synoptic Gospels. So, then, this rough editing might have been done to make Mary Magdalene and the Beloved Disciple appear as different persons.\n\nIn the \"Gospel of Mary\", part of the New Testament apocrypha — specifically the Gnostic gospels uncovered at Nag Hammadi — a certain Mary who is commonly identified as Mary Magdalene is constantly referred to as being loved by Jesus more than the others. In the Gospel of Philip, another Gnostic Nag Hammadi text, the same is specifically said about Mary Magdalene.\n\nBrian J. Capper argues that the Beloved Disciple was a priestly member of a quasimonastic, mystical, and ascetic Jewish aristocracy, located on Jerusalem's prestigious southwest hill, who had hosted Jesus' last supper in that location, citing the scholar D.E.H. Whiteley, who deduced that the Beloved Disciple was the host at the last supper. Capper suggests, to explain the largely distinctive designation of the Beloved Disciple as one loved by Jesus, that the language of 'love' was particularly related to Jewish groups which revealed the distinctive social characteristics of 'virtuoso religion' in ascetic communities. The British scholar Richard Bauckham reaches the similar conclusion that the beloved disciple, who also authored the gospel attributed to John, was probably a literally sophisticated member of the (surprisingly extensive) high priestly family clan.\n\nGerd Theissen and Annette Merz suggest the testimony may have come from a lesser known disciple, perhaps from Jerusalem.\n\nJames D. Tabor argues that the Beloved Disciple is James, brother of Jesus (the type of relative to Jesus, brother or cousin, depends on how one translates the word). One of several pieces of evidence Tabor offers is a literal interpretation of , \"Then when Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, Woman, behold your son.\" However, elsewhere in that gospel, the beloved disciple refers to the risen Jesus as \"the Lord\" rather than as \"my brother\".\n\nTheories about the reference usually include an attempt to explain why this anonymizing idiom is used at all, rather than stating an identity.\n\nSuggestions accounting for this are numerous. One common proposal is that the author concealed his name due simply to modesty. Another is that concealment served political or security reasons, made necessary by the threat of persecution or embarrassment during the time of the gospel's publication. The author may have been a highly placed person in Jerusalem who was hiding his affiliation with Christianity, or the anonymity may have been appropriate for one living the withdrawn life of an ascetic, and one of the many unnamed disciples in the Gospel may have been either the Beloved Disciple himself or others under his guidance, who out of the humility of their ascetic commitment hid their identity or subsumed their witness under that of their spiritual master.\n\nMartin L. Smith, a member of the Society of St. John the Evangelist, writes that the author of John's gospel may have deliberately obscured the identity of the Beloved Disciple so readers of the gospel may better identify with the disciple's relationship with Jesus:\n\nIn art, the Beloved Disciple is often portrayed as a beardless youth, usually as one of the Twelve Apostles at the Last Supper or with Mary at the crucifixion. In some medieval art, the Beloved Disciple is portrayed with his head in Christ's lap. Many artists have given different interpretations of which has the disciple whom Jesus loved \"reclining next to Jesus\" (v. 23; more literally, \"on/at his breast/bosom,\" \"en to kolpo\").\n\n"}

He was a child prodigy who was enrolled in college by the age of twelve and had two Ph.D's by twenty. His intellect soon made him feel like a god among other human beings, however. He went to work as a scientist for the Third Reich, but when the Allies began to win World War II he sold out his employers to the French Resistance. Zerstoiten thought no more of betraying them than he did his Nazi employers and tried to flee to South America, but was captured by British forces and extradited to America. Despite his crimes his intelligence was sought by the US military and Zerstoiten was put to work on a new generation of atomic weapons.\n\nZerstoiten had already realized he was destined to rule the world, and escaped to South America with success. There he began building a network of spies and soldiers and formally became the villain known as Dr. Destroyer. One of his disciples, Hernan Cortez, so idolized Zerstoiten that he created a similar guise for himself and became known as Professor Muerte, but Cortez ultimately developed the drive to conquer the world himself and broke away from Destroyer to form a team of terrorist supervillains called Terror, Incorporated. Destroyer went on to attempt many sweeping plans of global domination and in the process would frequently battle the world's greatest superheroes and peacekeeping organizations such as UNTIL.\n\nDoctor Destroyer possesses access to the most advanced technology known to man, some of it his own work, some stolen from other scientists. His suit of powered armor is the most powerful in the world giving him vast superhuman strength, an array of energy weapons and sensor equipment.

An illusionist named Rakshasa is one of his primary spies. Both first appeared in Day of the Destroyer, although at the time Rakshasa belonged instead to a villain team called Villains International. He became Destroyer's subordinate in the game's fifth edition. One of Dr. Destroyer's other chief agents was Menton, the most powerful psionic villain in the world, but when Destroyer was believed dead after the \"Battle of Detroit\" in the latest edition of the game, Menton escaped and struck out on his own.\nDestroyers newest assistant was Hellscream. A young man named Lester who lost his love for another man and was replaced by anger. Hellscream beholds the power of anger and pain. He is now a loyal servant to Dr. Destroyer and a local enemy to the super team, The Champions.\n\nIn the supplement \"Champions in 3D\", an alternate heroic version of Doctor Destroyer called Professor Preserver is introduced. He comes from a mirror-world called \"Backworld\" where the counterparts of heroes are villainous and the counterparts of villains are heroic.\n\nDr. Destroyer appeared in three issues of the comic book \"The Marksman\", which was based in part on the Champions game. He was assembling a team of international supervillains, including Professor Muerte, with which to launch an attempt at world domination. The League of Champions tracked his henchmen to their island lair and managed to capture some of the other villains, but they lacked sufficient power to breach Destroyer's personal force field and he escaped by submarine.\n\nDestroyer is a fixture of Champions Online.\n\n"}

Clues to a figure's identity are found in, for example, the physical characteristics of the Buddha, the objects the figure is holding, its \"mudra\" (hand gesture), and \"asana\" (sitting or standing position of the body). There may be an image in the figure's crown, or the figure could be holding a book, thunderbolt, vase, jewel, or lotus flower or stem.\n\nMandalas created for Japanese Shingon Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism can contain hundreds of different figures that may need interpretation. In his paper on the \"mudrās\" of bodhisattvas, Carl B. Becker, Kyoto University professor, describes the situation:\n\nRepresentations of the five Dhyani Buddhas, who are abstract aspects of Buddhahood rather than Buddhas or gods, have elaborate differences. Each must face in a different direction (north, south, east, west, or center), and, when painted, each is a different color (blue, yellow, red, green, or white). Each has a different \"mudrā\" and symbol; embodies a different aspect, type of evil, and cosmic element; has a different consort and spiritual son, as well as different animal vehicles (elephant, lion, peacock, harpys or garuda, or dragon).\n\nVairocana, the first Dhyani Buddha, embodying sovereignty and occupying the center, is a special case (in any case, he is distinct from Gautama and not normally confused with him). He was one of the Buddhas of Bamiyan blown up by the Taliban which China mourned and tried to replace with the world's tallest statue, named Spring Temple Buddha. Japanese Pure Land Buddhists think that Vairocana and the other Dhyani Buddhas are manifestations of Amitābha, but Japanese Shingon Buddhists think that Amitābha and the other Dhyani Buddhas are manifestations of Vairocana.\n\nAkshobhya, the second Dhyani Buddha who embodies steadfastness and faces east, and Gautama are indistinguishable. Both can be seated in the \"Vajraparyanka\" (also known as \"Bhūmisparśa\") pose, with the right hand on the right knee, palm turned inwardly, and middle finger touching the ground. Amitābha (Japanese: Amida) is the most ancient Dhyani Buddha, embodying light and facing west, and is the central figure in Pure Land Buddhism. A statue of Amitābha, when seated, has a \"samadhi\" \"mudrā\" with both palms face up, on top of each other, in his lap.\n\nBudai (in Chinese, or Hotei in Japanese) is often confused with Gautama or is thought to have originated Buddhism. He is an incarnation of the bodhisattva and future Buddha, Maitreya, who will come to Earth 4,000 years after Gautama disappears. His name means \"Cloth Sack\" for the bag of sweets he carries, eats and gives to children. Admired for his happiness and contentment, he is known in Chinese as \"The Laughing Buddha\" and sometimes in English as \"The Fat Buddha\".\n\nImages of Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, might be mistaken for Gautama. He is incarnated in the Dalai Lama, who is a tulku and the most revered Tibetan Buddhist monk.\n\nGautama might have representations in a hundred different attitudes or positions, of which four follow.\n\n\nSlides\n"}

The Paraguayan city Fernando de la Mora is named in his honor.\n\nHe was born in Limpio (formerly known as Tapúa) in 1773, in the family of Cavalry Captain Fernando de la Mora and Ana del Cazal who both belonged to families whose lineage descended from the Spanish conquistador Don Domingo Martínez de Irala.\n\nFernando received a good education. It is presumed that he studied at the College of San Carlos in Asunción. He also studied in Buenos Aires and National University of Córdoba. He studied law, becoming one of the most educated citizens of the time.\n\nDe la Mora had five brothers and a sister Rosa Isabel de la Mora Cazal. She married Mariano Antonio Martínez Viana, who was Congressman in 1811. From their marriage Francisca Carlota Viana de la Mora was born. Among his descendants was Juana Paula Carrillo Viana, wife of Don Carlos Antonio López and mother of Francisco Solano López.\n\nFernando de la Mora was married to Josefa Antonia Cohene, and had five children.\n\nHe entered export trade business that allowed Mora to establish good relationships with his peers. After his father died in 1801 Fernando took over the management of the family property.\n\nIn 1802 he was appointed deputy of Asunción by the Consulate of Buenos Aires, representing the union of merchants and held this position until 1804. His work at the port was useful in consolidating good relationships with the leading families of the city. Well educated and well liked, he was part of the small rural elite of Asunción and had social and commercial ties to major patrician families of Buenos Aires.\n\nHe participated in the defense of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata against British invasions of the River Plate between 1806 and 1807 and helped to expel British from Montevideo, which they had occupied in 1807.\n\nIn 1810 he started to work at the City Hall of Asunción.\n\nDe la Mora was a strong supporter of Paraguayan independence from Spain and participated in the Revolution of May 14, 1811.\n\nOn 17 June, 1811 the First National Congress of Paraguay convened. Mariano Antonio Molas proposed that Congress removes the last Spanish governor Bernardo de Velazco y Huidobro from all posts. A new five-man ruling junta was created with Colonel Fulgencio Yegros as its President.\n\nOther members of junta were Dr. José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, a skilled civilian figure, the young captain Pedro Juan Caballero representative of the troops that had defeated the invasion of Buenos Aires, a priest Francisco Xavier Bogarin and finally Don Fernando de la Mora, a civilian, who was linked to Paraguayan society.\n\nSoon after he had assumed his duties, de la Mora was appointed to lead a punitive expedition against the native Mbayá people. In November 1812 he was sent to the Villa Real of Concepcion with orders to recover Fort Borbon which had been recently occupied by the Portuguese. Having noticed the withdrawal of the forces belonging to the strong neighboring to the fort of Coimbra, Mora established the City Hall of Concepcion, created by decree of the junta on 12 November, 1812.\n\nDuring the absence of Mora from the meetings of the junta for almost the entire year of 1812 Dr. Francia managed on to increase his own power. Knowing that Mora was opponent to his ideas, Francia responded by accusing Mora with intentions of joining Paraguay with Buenos Aires and with the loss of some secret state documents. He was referring to the additional article of the treaty of 12 October, 1811 signed on Asunción with the Manuel Belgrano, which the First Triumvirate of Buenos Aires used to unjustifiably apply taxes to Paraguayan tobacco and start a trade war. \n\nFrancia, who had all the intentions of becoming the sole ruler of Paraguay, on 21 August, 1813 succeeded in removing Mora from the ruling junta.\n\nMora was implicated in the failed 1820 plot against Francia and was imprisoned for the rest of his life. His exact cause of death is uncertain, but it is assumed that he died in prison. \n\nOn 6 October, 1923 Municipality of Asunción decided to pay tribute to Mora by giving his name to the avenue that begins on the \"General Santos\" street and ends at \"Defensores del Chaco\" Avenue.\n\n\n"}

He is accepted as the first validated supercentenarian case on record. Since there is evidence that he served as a soldier in Napoleon's Grande Armée, in the 33rd Light Infantry Division, Boomgaard might in fact have been the oldest military veteran ever for several decades.\n\nLittle is known about Boomgaard's life. He was born in Groningen, Netherlands, where he also died. His parents were Adriaan Jacobs Boomgaard (1763-1844) and Geesje Geerts Bontekoe (1762-1834). His father was captain on a boat, and civil records say that Geert did the same work. Other sources say that he had also served as a soldier in the 33rd Light Infantry Regiment in Napoleon's Grande Armée.\n\nAt the age of 29, on 4 March 1818, he married Stijntje Bus (baptized 19 February 1797 - died 24 March 1830). Stijntje died aged 33, a month after the birth of their 8th child. A year later, 17 March 1831, Boomgaard married Grietje Abels Jonker (baptized 19 May 1793 - 18 May 1864), with whom he had four more children, for a total of 12. His last surviving child, Jansje Hinderika, died at the age of 57 in May 1885.\n\nBoomgaard died at age 110 years 135 days in Groningen.\n\nResearch on Boomgaard was published in three articles by E.J. Heeres in the genealogical periodical \"Gruoninga\" in 1976, 1977 and 1978. The website http://www.stehelene.org, which is dedicated to the rebuilding of the lost archives on the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène, shows his photograph, his (presumed) personal Sainte-Hélène medal, and a certificate which states that \"Adriaans, Gerrit, à Groningue, Pays-Bas, received this medal\" on behalf of his active military service during the reign of Napoleon I. The certificate is registered at la Grande Chancellerie No. 1871, and bears the stamped signature of the Duc de Plaisance Général , Grand Chancelier (1853–1859).\n"}
{"id": "158664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158664", "title": "Ip Man", "text": "Ip Man\n\nIp Man, also known as Yip Man, (; 1 October 1893 – 2 December 1972), was a Cantonese martial artist, and a master teacher of Wing Chun. He had several students who later became martial arts masters in their own right. His most famous student was Bruce Lee.\n\nIp Man was born to Yip Oi-dor and Wu Shui, as the third of four children. He grew up in a wealthy family in Foshan, Guangdong, and received traditional Chinese education, alongside his elder brother Yip Kai-gak, his elder sister Yip Wan-mei, and younger sister Yip Wan-hum.\n\nIp started learning Wing Chun from Chan Wah-shun when he was 12. Chan was 64 at the time, and Ip became Chan's last student. Due to his teacher's age, Ip learned most of his skills and techniques from Chan's second eldest disciple, Wu Chung-sok (吳仲素). Chan only lived for three more years after Ip's training started, and one of his dying wishes was to have Wu continue teaching Ip.\n\nAt the age of 16, Ip moved to Hong Kong, with help from his relative Leung Fut-ting. One year later, he attended school at St. Stephen's College—a secondary school for wealthy families and foreigners living in Hong Kong. Six months after moving to Hong Kong, a classmate of Ip's named Lai told him that a friend of Lai's father who was an expert in Kung Fu techniques was living with them, and had offered to have a friendly sparring match with Ip. At the time, Ip was undefeated so he eagerly accepted the challenge. He went to Lai's house on a Sunday afternoon, and after exchanging brief pleasantries, challenged the man to a duel. The man was Leung Bik, and he easily overwhelmed Ip Man. Incredulous at the speed with which he had been countered, Ip requested a second duel and was beaten again, just as soundly. Discouraged by his defeat, Ip left without a word and afterward was so depressed that he did not dare mention that he knew Kung Fu. A week later, Lai told him that the man he had fought was asking after him. Ip replied that he was too embarrassed to return, at which point Lai told him that Leung Bik had highly praised his Kung Fu techniques and that he was the son of Leung Jan, who trained Ip's master Chan Wah-shun. Ip proceeded to train with Leung Bik for several years, until Leung Bik moved back to Foshan. \n\nIp returned to Foshan when he was 24, to become a policeman. He taught some Wing Chun to several of his subordinates, friends and relatives, but did not officially run a martial arts school. Some of his best known informal students were Chow Kwong-yue (周光裕), Kwok Fu (郭富), Lun Kah (倫佳), Chan Chi-sun (陳志新), Xu He-Wei (徐和威) and Lui Ying (呂應). Among them, Chow Kwong-yue was said to be the best, but he eventually went into commerce and stopped practicing martial arts. Kwok Fu and Lun Kah went on to teach students of their own and they passed down the art of Wing Chun in the Foshan and Guangdong region. Chan Chi-sun and Lui Ying went to Hong Kong later but neither of them accepted any students. Ip went to live with Kwok Fu during the Second Sino-Japanese War and only returned to Foshan after the war, where he continued his career as a police officer. Ip left Foshan for Hong Kong at the end of 1949 after the Chinese Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War, as Ip was an officer for the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), the Communists' rival.\n\nInitially, Ip Man's teaching business was poor because Ip's students typically stayed for only a couple of months. He moved his school twice: first to Castle Peak Road in Sham Shui Po, and then to Lee Tat Street (利達街) in Yau Ma Tei. By then, some of his students had attained proficiency in Wing Chun and were able to start their own schools. Some of his students and descendants sparred with other martial artists to compare their skills and their victories helped increase Ip's fame.\n\nIn 1967, Ip and some of his students established the Ving Tsun Athletic Association (詠春體育會). The main purpose of the Ving Tsun Athletic Association was to help Ip tackle his financial difficulties in Hong Kong, which was said to have caused his supposed regular use of opium. One of his former students, Duncan Leung, claimed that Ip used tuition money to support his opium addiction.\n\nIp died on 2 December 1972 in his unit at 149 Tung Choi Street in Hong Kong, from throat cancer, only seven months before the death of Bruce Lee.\n\nIp's legacy is the global practice of Wing Chun. Ip Chun, the eldest son of Ip Man, is as passionate and relentless in keeping his father's Wing Chun kung fu legacy alive and in 2014 Ip Chun was selected to represent Wing Chun as the inheritor of the legacy of Wing Chun-style kung fu. Ip's notable students include: Leung Sheung, Lok Yiu, Chu Shong-tin, Wong Shun Leung, Bruce Lee, Moy Yat, Ho Kam Ming, Victor Kan, his nephew Lo Man Kam, his sons Ip Ching and Ip Chun, and closed door student Leung Ting. \n\nIp wrote a written history of Wing Chun. Many artifacts of his life are on display in the \"Yip Man Tong\" museum in the Foshan Ancestral Temple grounds.\n\n\"Ip Man\", a Hong Kong film based on the life of Ip Man, starring Donnie Yen as the martial artist, was released in cinemas in 2008. The film takes a number of liberties with Ip's life, often for dramatic effect. Ip's eldest son Ip Chun appears in the film and served as a consultant on the production, which focuses on Ip's life during the 1930s to the 1940s during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The film is the first to be based on the life of Ip. \n\nThe sequel \"Ip Man 2\" focuses on Ip's beginnings in Hong Kong and his students, including Bruce Lee. Ip Man has taught many other people.\nAmid a surge of Ip Man–related film projects in production, Donnie Yen told the Chinese media in March 2010 that after \"Ip Man 2\", he will no longer play the Wing Chun master. He stated, \"I would never ever touch any films related to Ip Man. This will be my final film on the subject. Whenever something becomes a success, everyone would jump on the bandwagon, this is very frightening. Did you know how many Ip Man films are in production? Under such condition, we would not progress, it'd only lead to over-saturation of the subject matter.\" However a new film to the same series - \"Ip Man 3\" - was released on 24 December 2015 having Donnie Yen again starring as Ip Man.\n\nIp Man was played by Wang Luoyong in \"\" and by Yu Chenghui in \"The Legend of Bruce Lee\", respectively a 1993 American biographical drama film and a 2008 Chinese television series, both based on the life story of Bruce Lee, who was one of Ip's students.\n\nAnother Hong Kong film based on Ip Man's life, called \"The Legend Is Born – Ip Man\", was released in June 2010. Herman Yau directed the film and it starred Dennis To as Ip Man. Ip Chun makes a special appearance in the film as Leung Bik.\n\nWong Kar-wai's \"The Grandmaster\" is a 2013 film starring Tony Leung as Ip Man. The film concentrates more on the end of an era in Chinese martial arts history as the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. It was created in an almost biographical style, highlighting parts of history. In contrast with the other Ip Man–related projects, \"The Grandmaster\" is a more reflective film, focusing more on the musings and philosophies between martial arts and life, as well as Ip Man's journey through the early 1930s to the early 1950s.\n\nThe 2013 Hong Kong film \"\", directed by Herman Yau and starring Anthony Wong as Ip Man, focuses on Ip's later life in Hong Kong. Ip Chun makes a cameo appearance in the film. This film also focuses on the loyalty of his pupils towards him.\n\nThe 2013 Chinese television series \"Ip Man\", based on Ip Man's life, was aired on the television network Astro On Demand between March and May 2013. It was directed by Fan Xiaotian and starred Kevin Cheng as the eponymous character.\n\nWing Chun lineage according to Ip Man.\n"}

He currently serves on the board of the Cherokee Arts and Humanities Council.\n\nErb created the first Cherokee animation in the Cherokee language, \"The Beginning They Told\". The 11-minute animated piece relays parts of the Cherokee's creation story, featuring Buzzard, Beaver, and the Water Beetle, who brings fire to humanity.\n\nHe combines traditional storytelling with 21st-century technology as a means of teaching the Cherokee language to young people. His work has frequently been screened by the National Museum of the American Indian. \"We're competing with mass culture,\" Erb says. \"The kids have a choice; they can watch our animation or they can watch Elmo. You have to compete with all of that so the children will want to know their traditional stories and their language.\"\n\nBesides collaborating with students to produce animation in their tribal languages, Erb also produce educational material, such as animated shorts of animals singing numbers and colors in Cherokee. The animated format provides a solution for the challenge of relaying what is traditional oral history to the next generation.\n\nErb trained and mentors his colleagues, Roy Boney Jr. (Cherokee Nation), Matt Mason (Cherokee) and Nathan Young (Pawnee-Delaware-Kiowa), and together their work has established Tahlequah, Oklahoma as the \"Indian Animation Capital\".\n\nHis work is shown at Native film festival throughout the United States and currently his work is supported in part by the Cherokee Nation. Mason, Boney, and Erb formed a production company called Cherokee Robot.\n\nErb's collaboration with students has led to some surprising new developments in the retelling of oral histories. Muscogee Creek middle school students and Erb created a video that combined animation, claymation and diorama sets to tell the story of Indian Removal. Their account has the Muscogee Creeks, freezing on the Trail of Tears, traveling through space to Paris, France, where beret-wearing Frenchmen teach the Creeks to stomp dance. Rabbit, the Muscogee Trickster, steals a coal of fire from the French and takes it back to the Creeks on their way to Indian Territory.\n\nErb is also a fine artist.

The majority of the group are farmers, laborers, and petty workers, settled across crentral and southern Karnataka,goa, Kerala. Kudubis are part of the larger Kunbi–Kurmi diaspora, a generic farming community spread out over India, with the probable exception of only Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAccording to Goan historian Anant Ramakrishna Dhume, the Kunbi caste are modern descendants of ancient Mundari tribes. In his work, Dhume mentions several words of Mundari origin in the Konkani language and also elaborates on the deities worshipped by the ancient tribe, their customs, methods of farming, etc. The Portuguese, who ruled over Goa for over 500 years, considered the Kunbi, Velip and Gowada communities as \"Tribu\", which means tribes. The Central Government failed to extend the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order 1950 to the Union Territory of Goa, Daman, and Diu immediately after the liberation of Goa in 1961 and that was perceived as an injustice by many. Kunbis are included in ST list in Goa state only in the year 2002. It is mentioned in the book \"People of India\" by Suresh Kumar Singh, in the Anthropological Survey of India (2003), and in Gujarat (page 731) that the term 'Kunbi' is derived from \"kun\", meaning \"people\", and \"bi\", meaning \"seeds\". Fused together, the two terms mean \"those who germinate more seeds from one seed\". In the book \"Caste and Race in India\", author Sr. G S Ghurye has opinionated (page 31) the idea that \"Kurmi, Kanbi and Kunbi perhaps signify the occupation of the group, viz., that of cultivation, though it is not improbable that the name may of tribal origin.\"\n\nIn 1510 A.D, Goa was captured by the Portuguese general Alfonso Albuquerque from the Adil Shah dynasty of Bijapur, and Portuguese rule was established. In 1545 St. Francis Xavier, sent a letter to John III of Portugal, requesting an Inquisition to be installed in Goa. The inquisitor's first act was to forbid any open practice of the Hindu faith on pain of death. The Portuguese colonial administration enacted anti-Hindu laws to encourage conversions to Christianity. Prohibition was laid upon Hindu rituals as well. In all, over 42 Hindu practices were prohibited. All the people above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching or otherwise be punished. Several Hindu temples were destroyed as well. An order was issued for suppressing the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak the Portuguese language. The law provided for dealing toughly with anyone using the local language. Following that law all the non-Christian cultural symbols and the books written in local languages were sought out to be destroyed. In the first hundred years, the Inquisition burned 57 alive at the stake and 64 in effigy. Others were sentenced to various punishments, totalling 4,046. The Kudumbi were forced to migrate from Goa following religious persecution by the Portuguese during the said infamous Goa Inquisition. The Kudumbis, along with Gouda Saraswat Brahmins (Malayalam: ഗൌഡ് സാരസ്വത്), Daivajnas and Vaishya Vanis who wanted to preserve their religious and cultural identity, migrated from Goa along the west coast of India, primarily through sea voyages.\n\nSome of the groups that fled Goa landed in coastal districts of state of Karnataka, that is, the Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts, and some groups voyaged further to Kerala. One of these first exodus groups landed on the island of Cherai, near Paravur Taluk in the Ernakulam district of Kerala. They slowly migrated southwards from Ernakulam and settled in coastal areas including Kochi, (Cochin) Vypeen, North Paravur, Mala, Kerala, Kodungallur, Trichur, Kozhikode, Tellicherry, Kannur, Tripunithura, Alapuzha, Changanacherry, Kottayam, Thuravoor, Cherthala, Kayamkulam, Kollam, and Thiruvananthapuram. The largest Kudumbi settlement is in Vypeen near Kochi. They were experts in paddy cultivation, especially in the low-lying fields of the Kerala Backwaters, and they pioneered cultivation of the well-known \"Chettiverippu\" strain of paddy rice, brought from Konkan (ref. \"Castes and Tribes of South India\" by E Thurston, Volume 4, 1909).\nThe \"Census Report of India\", 1961 – Volume VII, Kerala (page 210) refers to the Kudumbi community, and it is recorded that,\n\nA group of Kudumbis may have migrated from Cochin to Travancore at the invitation of a Maharaja, Marthanda Varma and on arrival been given (free of tax) a coconut garden and land to grow rice. In return they were required to supply Avil to the palace and temple free of cost.\n\nK. R. Gowri Amma, a prominent figure in the communist movement in Kerala and former Minister, in her autobiography narrates the backwardness of Kudumbi Community as:\nA vivid description of the Kudumbi Community is available in Chapter 13 of the book \"Keralathile Stala Charitrangal, Eranakulam Jilla\" It is noted by the learned author that the main agricultural laborers in the islands around Kochi have been from the Pulaya and Kudumbi castes. It is also observed that during the Portuguese period, a lot of people belonging to the Pulaya and Mukkuva castes were converted to Christianity. However Kudumbis adhered to their religion and language until the last leg.\n\nThe community is officially classified as being within the Socially and Economically Backward Communities (SEBC) by the State Government. Many students have utilized the benefits of reservation legislation to improve their lives. A mass struggle and hunger strike were organized by the social organization Kudumbi Seva Sanghom (KSS) during 2006–2007, demanding a 1% reservation for Kudumbis seeking admission to various professional courses in Kerala. In 2008 the State Government finally acceded to the demand vide GO (MS)No.95/08/SC/ST dated 06.10.2008. Further, the Kudumbi community is totally exempted from the creamy layer. Kudumbi Community is one among eight communities having hereditary occupations/calling, which had been excluded from the category of 'creamy layer' on account of its \"Social Backwardness\" as per GO (P) No.81/09/SCSTDD dated 26 September 2009.\n\nIn 2014 K.V. Bhaskaran contested as an independent candidate from Ernakulam parliamentary constituency in the Lok Sabha elections. He contested in the Lok Sabha elections to raise certain unfulfilled social demands raised by the kudumbi community during the last five decades.\n\nThe KIRTADS submitted a report stating that the Kudumbis should be included in the Scheduled Caste list.\nAfter his election on 23 March 1987, and when challenged in court, K. Karunakaran, former chief minister of Kerala, supported inclusion of Kudumbis in the list. United Democratic Front (UDF)had assured to use maximum pressure on the center for including the Kudumbies in the SC list. However the legitimate claim of the Kudumbi Community stands in the ST list and not in SC List.\nOn 10 March 2008, Veerendra Kumar, member of parliament (MP) of the 14th Lok Sabha, writer and chairman and managing director of Mathrubhumi press, made mention before the parliament under rule 377 concerning the classification of the Kudumbis. He pointed to the community's poverty, low level of literacy, and lack of ability to take any important government position. On 4 May 2012, K. P. Dhanapalan MP, also made a special mention to the parliament about the classification of the Kudumbis. In December 2011 in New Delhi, and on 30 May 2012 in Kochi a public protest was organised by supporters of the rights of the Kudumbi, including the Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy (Association for Defence of Democracy, J.S.S.) to demand inclusion of the community in the list of Scheduled Castes.\n\nIn her autobiography, political activist, K. R. Gowri Amma wrote,\n\nKudubis of Karnataka (who were migrated from Goa and settled in the coastal districts of Kartaka) are non – scheduled tribes . They are also suffering from problems including non – recognition as a tribe in Karnataka (Caste Practices and influences Affecting Tribals – A Case study of Kudubis of Karnataka by Dr. Y Ravindranath Rao) Kudubis of Karnataka has also urged state government to include them in the Scheduled Tribe list.\n\nFor decades the Kudumbi led a socially secluded life. During the late 19th century in Kerala, when a socio-cultural revival took place in many backward communities, the Kudumbi opened themselves up to mainstream socio-cultural and economic developments. Unfortunately, newer socio-economic and cultural changes in the community spurred a slow reverse cultural diffusion.\n\nAccording to Kerala tradition, the ceremony of \"Talapoli\", as a procession of ladies carrying oil lamps accompanied by \"chenda\" (percussion instruments) or \"tappu melam\", can be seen during the festivals in these \"devi\" temples. The traditional \"haampu\" (multi-stacked portable brass lamp or a similar stone lamp) found in a number of Kudumbi temples is lit on special \"puja\" days. Votive items made from Aval (puffed rice) or beaten rice and \"jaggery\" are still offered as \"prasadam\" in many Kudumbi temples. \"Holi\", the festival of colors, is celebrated in many Devi temples by the Kudumbi. During this festival, \"Kamadeva\" (Bodhan) the symbolic entity of \"Kama\" will be burnt to fire, purifying the life of all who participate in the festival. There will be a procession on the streets where all the participants will be applying colour each other, dancing with songs sung in Kudumbi language. Youngsters and children go in a group, pour yellow water from the pot kept in front of every house, and finally gather at their local \"devili\" temple. In the night there will be a special group dance by women (\"fuguda\") by gathering in a circle and clapping and doing brisk movements. After this there will be delicious dinner and food will be offered to souls. Even Kudumbis of Karnataka, who had migrated from Goa along with their brethren in Kerala and other places continue to celebrate their traditional festival 'holi' by preserving their own unique culture.\n\nKudumbi Seva Sanghom (KSS), Kerala Kudumbi Federation, Kudumbi Seva Samiti, Kudumbi Samajam, Kudumbi Karayogams, and Kudumbi Mahajana Sabha-Vypeen are the social organizations representing the community in Kerala. KSS is the predominant organization representing the majority of Kudumbis in Kerala, and it supports the social, educational and cultural uplifting of the community.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "255012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255012", "title": "Matthias Flacius", "text": "Matthias Flacius\n\nMatthias Flacius Illyricus (Latin; ) (3 March 1520 – 11 March 1575) was a Lutheran reformer from Istria, present day Croatia. He was notable as a theologian, sometimes dissenting strongly with his fellow Lutherans, and as a scholar for his editorial work on the \"Magdeburg Centuries\".\n\nFlacius was born in Albona (today Labin) in Istria, son of Andrea Vlacich alias Francovich and Jacobea Luciani, daughter of a wealthy and powerful Albonian family. His mother's uncle was the monk Baldo Lupetino, likewise born in Albona, who later was condemned to death in Venice for his faith. His father died during his early childhood.\n\nAt the age of sixteen Flacius went to study in Venice, where he was taught by the humanist Giambattista Cipelli (Baptista Aegnatius / Battista Egnazio). At the age of seventeen, he intended to join a monastic order, with a view to sacred learning. His intention, however, was diverted by his uncle, Baldo Lupetina, provincial of the Franciscans and sympathetic to the Reformation cause, who convinced him to start a university career.\n\nFlacius continued his studies in Basel in 1539, then went to Tübingen and finally ended up in Wittenberg, where in (1541) he was welcomed by Philip Melanchthon. There he came under the influence of Martin Luther. In 1544, Flacius was appointed professor of Hebrew at Wittenberg. He finished his master's degree on 24 February 1546, ranking first among the graduates.\n\nSoon, Flacius was prominent in the theological discussions of the time, strenuously opposing the \"Augsburg Interim\", and the compromise of Melanchthon known as the \"Leipzig Interim\". Melanchthon wrote of him with venom as a renegade (\"aluimus in sinu serpentem\", \"we have nourished a snake in our bosom\"). In 1549 Flacius moved to Magdeburg. On 7 May 1557 he was appointed professor of New Testament at the theological faculty in Jena but was soon involved in controversy with his colleague Victorinus Strigel on the synergistic question (relating to the function of the will in the conversion).\n\nAffirming the natural inability of man, he adopted a position on sin as not being an accident of human nature, but involved in its substance, since The Fall of Man. Holding to a strong view of what Calvinists later called total depravity, Flacius insisted that human nature was entirely transformed by original sin, human beings were transformed from goodness and almost wholly corrupted with evil, making them kin to the Devil in his view, so that within them, without divine assistance, there lies no power even to cooperate with the Gospel when they hear it preached. Human acts of piety are valueless in themselves, and humans are entirely dependent on the grace of God for salvation. Those who agreed with him on this point, for example, Cyriacus Spangenberg, were termed Flacians.\n\nResisting ecclesiastical censure, he left Jena in December 1561 to found an academy at Regensburg. That assignment was not successful, so in October 1566 he accepted a call from the Lutheran community at Antwerp. Thence he was driven in early 1567 by the exigencies of war, and went to Frankfurt, where the authorities stood against him. He proceeded to Strasbourg where he was well received by the superintendent Johannes Marbach. Here again, his religious views caused controversies. The authorities ordered him to leave the city by May Day 1573. The prioress Catharina von Meerfeld of the Convent of White Ladies secretly harboured him and his family in Frankfurt where he fell ill and died on 11 March 1575.\n\nFlacius' life was eventful in a turbulent epoch. He represents in some sense a move in the direction of the scientific study of church history in the modern sense and similarly of hermeneutics, though no doubt his impelling motive was not dispassionate but polemical, namely to prove the false premises of Roman Catholicism. His characteristic formula, \"historia est fundamentum doctrinae\", is better understood now than in his own day.\n\nIn 1545, while at Wittenberg, Flacius married a pastor's daughter. He had twelve children with his first wife before she died in 1564. He remarried the same year in Regensburg and had six more children with his second wife. His son was professor of logic and medicine at Rostock.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58071282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58071282", "title": "Miriam Miranda", "text": "Miriam Miranda\n\nMiriam Miranda is a Honduran activist who advocates for the human and environmental rights of the Garífuna people. As the leader of the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH), Miranda has coordinated efforts to counter land theft by big tourism businesses, reclaim ancestral territories formerly belonging to Garífuna communities, stop drug traffickers, promote sustainable environmental practices, and support community leadership development for local youth and women. She has been illegally arrested and beaten by local authorities and kidnapped by drug traffickers. \n\nMiranda has received the Óscar Romero Human Rights Award and the US Food Sovereignty Alliance's International Food Sovereignty Prize. In 2016, she was awarded the Carlos Escaleras environmental prize for 30 years of activist work.\n\nMiriam Miranda was born in Santa Fe, Colón, a coastal Garífuna community in Honduras. When Miranda was a child, she and her family left the village in search of better work and schooling opportunities, travelling to various banana plantations. \n\nShe later studied at a university in Tegucigalpa. During her time as a student, Miranda became increasingly aware of social movements, particularly movements that supported the rights of low-income and indigenous women in Honduras. She eventually decided to focus on advocating for the rights of Garífuna people: mixed-race descendants of West African slaves who escaped to the Caribbean in the 1600s before settling in Central and South American countries such as Honduras.\n\nMiranda is the leader of the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH), which was originally established in 1979. The organization actively supports the legal rights of indigenous and Garífuna communities, while also providing resources to support community leadership development, environmental education, health education, and other services.\n\nMembers of OFRANEH have occupied areas of land in Honduras that once belonged to Garífuna communities, reclaiming the land as ancestral territory and making use of international human rights laws to avoid eviction. They have also brought legal cases to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights regarding the confiscation of former Garífuna community lands. In 2015, after Canadian businessman Randy Jorgensen illegally built a mega-tourism enterprise on Garífuna land, OFRANEH successfully brought Jorgensen to trial. Miranda has worked to halt other developments disruptive to local communities such as hydroelectric and palm-oil industrial projects.\n\nIn Honduras, most commercial radio and television stations are either controlled or censored by the national government. After activists realized their attempts to protect Garífuna ancestral territory were being hindered or obstructed by local mainstream media, OFRANEH established a new Garífuna community radio station. OFRANEH subsequently partnered with several other community radio stations to create the Mesoamerica Network of Community Radio. OFRANEH now operates six radio stations across Honduras.\n\nOne of the radio stations funded and organized by OFRANEH, named Faluma Bimetu (Garífuna for \"sweet coconut\"), is located in the northern Honduras village of Triunfo de la Cruz. The station was established in 1997, and broadcasts a 24-hour cycle of traditional music and shows on topics such as environmental issues, domestic violence, substance abuse, health, spirituality, and leadership development for youth and women. Faluma Bimetu has been targeted for its work – in 2010, the radio station was hit by an arson attempt that damaged the building and its broadcasting equipment. Although the police made no arrests, some activists alleged that the arson was the work of the Indura Beach and Golf Resort, a tourism corporation that has been accused of evicting Garífuna families and illegally redrawing land boundaries in order to build new hotels.\n\nOther OFRANEH radio stations have focused on highlighting social injustices and the work of local activists. In 2016, Radio Lumamali Giriga broadcast an interview with Honduran activist Madeline David Fernandez, who had been arrested and allegedly tortured by Honduran police. The story was subsequently picked up by other radio stations and organizations. \n\nThe British NGO Global Witness has called Honduras \"the deadliest place on earth\" for activists working against big businesses. Between 2010 and 2017, approximately 120 Honduran activists were killed. Miranda has been threatened and kidnapped in retaliation for her work, and has been publicly portrayed as a criminal in local news media. \n\nOn March 28, 2012, as non-violent public protests were taking place across Honduras, Miranda was beaten by police and military, then arrested and detained for twelve hours. She was charged with sedition upon her release. \n\nIn 2014, OFRANEH activists discovered that drug traffickers had clear-cut swaths of forest to build an illegal air strip in northern Honduras. After authorities were notified, the air strip was destroyed by the Honduran Army. A few months later, when Miranda and several colleagues revisited the area and found that the traffickers had returned, they were kidnapped and held for several hours by armed men employed by the traffickers.\n\nIn January 2017, while in the port city of La Ceiba, Miranda and three other Garífuna community leaders were arrested and illegally detained by police. The arrest happened in spite of the fact that Honduras authorities had been ordered by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to provide police protection for Miranda.\n\nTraditionally, Garífuna ancestral lands in Honduras are inherited by women and passed down to their children. Women are often deeply involved in the protection of land and the preservation of cultural traditions. \n\nIn interviews, Miranda has emphasized her belief in the importance of acknowledging women as defenders of communities and cultural heritage: \"Everywhere throughout Honduras, like in all of Latin America, Africa, Asia, women are at the forefront of the struggles for our rights, against racial discrimination, for the defense of our commons and our survival. We’re at the front not only with our bodies but also with our force, our ideas, our proposals. We don’t only birth children, but ideas and actions as well.\"\nIn 2015, OFRANEH received the International Food Sovereignty Prize from the US Food Sovereignty Alliance. Miranda was also named co-recipient of the Óscar Romero Human Rights Award, alongside Honduran environmental activist Berta Caceres. In October 2016, in recognition of her work defending Garífuna rights for 30 years, Miranda was awarded the Carlos Escaleras environmental prize. \n"}

Estemirova was abducted by unknown persons on 15 July 2009 around 8:30 a.m. from her home in Grozny, Chechnya, as she was working on \"extremely sensitive\" cases of human rights abuses in Chechnya. Two witnesses reported they saw Estemirova being pushed into a car shouting that she was being abducted. Her remains were found with bullet wounds in the head and chest area at 4:30 p.m. in woodland away from the federal road \"Kavkaz\" near the village of Gazi-Yurt, Ingushetia.\n\nBorn in Kamyshlov, Sverdlovsk Oblast to Russian and Chechen parents, Estemirova graduated with a degree in history from Grozny University and taught history in a local high school until 1998. In 1991, she worked as a correspondent for the local newspapers \"The Voice\" and \"The Worker of Grozny\". While working on TV in Grozny, she filmed thirteen short documentaries about victims of the Russian punitive practices. She participated in the Organization of Filtration Camps Inmates as a press-secretary. The widow of a Chechen policeman, she gathered evidence on human rights violations since the beginning of the Second Chechen war in 1999, leaving her daughter in Yekaterinburg with relatives. In 2000, she became a representative for the Memorial Human Rights Centre in her native Grozny. She visited many hospitals in Chechnya and Ingushetia, taking hundreds of photographs of child victims of the war.\n\nEstemirova was a frequent contributor to the independent Moscow newspaper \"Novaya Gazeta\" and the Caucasus news website Kavkazsky Uzel.\n\nEstemirova received the Right Livelihood Award as a representative of \"Memorial\" at a ceremony in the Swedish parliament building in 2004. Along with Sergey Kovalyov, chairman of Memorial, she was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal by the Group of the European People's Party in 2005. In October 2007, she was awarded the first Anna Politkovskaya Award, honouring brave women human rights defenders from war and conflict, who speak up for the victims, often at great personal risk. The Anna Politkovskaya Award is presented annually to honour the memory of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya on the anniversary of her murder on 7 October 2006, by Reach All Women in War (RAW), an international human rights organization supporting women human rights defenders in war and conflict zones. Estemirova worked together with investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya and human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov, both of whom were also murdered, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.\n\nEstemirova was abducted on 15 July 2009 from her home in Grozny, Chechnya. According to Tanya Lokshina of the Moscow bureau of Human Rights Watch, unknown individuals abducted Estemirova near her house in Grozny at around 8:30 a.m. Her colleagues raised an alert when she did not come to a planned meeting and went to her home, found witnesses and questioned them. Two witnesses reportedly saw Estemirova being pushed into a car shouting that she was being abducted. Lokshina said Estemirova was abducted as she was working on \"extremely sensitive\" cases of human rights abuses in Chechnya. Lokshina said that she had been targeted for her professional activities. Human Rights Watch had demanded to the Kremlin and Ramzan Kadyrov that Estemirova be returned home safely.\n\nVladimir Markin, press secretary for the investigative committee of the Prosecutor General of Russia, said a body of a woman with bullet wounds in the head and chest was found at 4:30 p.m. in woodland 100 m away from the federal road \"Kavkaz\" near the village of Gazi-Yurt, Ingushetia. Investigators found items belonging to Estemirova in the purse of the woman. These items were a passport, an ID of the Chechnya expert for the Human Rights Commissioner of Russia and the mandate of the penitentiary supervision public committee.\n\nEstemirova was \"buried in line with Islamic tradition before sunset on Thursday, in a cemetery in her ancestral village, Koshkeldy, in Chechnya's Gudermes district.\"\n\nAbout 150 people attended a vigil that was held in Moscow's Pushkin Square about nine days after the murder, following Russian Orthodox tradition. After all but twenty people had left, police arrested the organizer of the event, Viktor Sotirko of Memorial. He was held for two hours and charged with disturbing the peace. Police said only 30 people had been sanctioned to attend the event, but far more had shown up.\n\nThe BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, stationed in Moscow, reported that Estemirova was engaged in \"very important and dangerous work\", investigating hundreds of cases of alleged kidnappings, torture and extrajudicial killings by Russian government troops or paramilitaries in Chechnya.\n\nRussian President Dmitri Medvedev expressed \"outrage\" at the murder and ordered a top-level investigation. Speaking in Germany at the time of her funeral, he paid tribute to her and again pledged a thorough investigation. He said it was \"obvious\" to him that her murder was linked to her professional work.\n\nMemorial claimed that \"state terror\" was to blame, calling the killing an \"extrajudicial execution\" by government-backed death squads. Memorial's chairman Oleg Orlov said that Ramzan Kadyrov threatened Natalya and that Russian president Medvedev was content with Kadyrov being a murderer. Orlov said in a statement: \"I know, I am sure who is guilty of Natalya Estemirova's murder, we all know him. His name is Ramzan Kadyrov.\" According to Orlov, shortly before the murder Kadyrov made an open threat to her by saying: \"Yes, my hands are up to the elbows in blood. And I am not ashamed of that. I killed and will kill bad people\". Kadyrov denied any involvement and promised to investigate the killing personally. He condemned the killers, saying they \"must be punished as the cruelest of criminals\". It was later reported that in response to Orlov's accusation, Kadyrov would be suing the rights group for defamation, and would target Orlov personally in the complaint. Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, Chechen human rights ombudsman, called Orlov's accusation \"groundless and ludicrous\". \n\nIn January 2010, Ramzan Kadyrov, in an interview to \"Russia Today\" accused Berezovsky of murdering Estemirova. Despite expressing confidence that the crime will be solved, he acknowledged that as of that date it had not: \n\nMedvedev responded to the accusation, saying the timing of the crime, a day before his trip to Germany for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel, was a provocation intended to give rise to \"the most primitive theories and those most disagreeable to the state\". Merkel said she expressed her \"outrage\" over the killing in her talks with Medvedev \"and made clear that everything must be done to solve this crime\".\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said he was \"appalled and saddened\" by Estemirova's murder. UN spokeswoman Marie Okabe stated that Ban \"urges the Russian authorities to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation in order to bring the perpetrators of this heinous killing to justice, and by doing so, to send a strong and unambiguous message that the targeting of human rights activists will not be tolerated\". The chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, Joseph Daul, condemned the perpetrators and called for an investigation and bringing the perpetrators to trial.\n\nThe Sweden-based human rights organization Civil Rights Defenders named the Natalia Project after Estemirova. The Natalia Project is an alarm and positioning system for human rights defenders at risk. \n\nIn February 2010 an anonymous source in the Russian law enforcement bodies claimed that investigators knew Estemirova's murderer. Yet, the murderer wasn't caught, nor was the organizer of the crime identified. \n\nJournalists of \"Novaya Gazeta\" together with the human rights society Memorial and the International Federation for Human Rights are conducting their own investigation, they also monitor the official investigation. According to them, the main version of the official investigators is that Estemirova was murdered by rebel Alkhazur Bashayev, a member of a jamaat in the Chechen village of Shalazhy (Шалажи). On 15 January 2010 during a search in the house of Alkhazur Bashayev, the investigators found a large stockpile of weapons, including the handgun that was used to murder Estemirova and a counterfeit police id with a photograph of Bashayev. On 7 February 2010, they found an abandoned VAZ-2107 car that was identified as the car bought by Bashayev. In the car they found a suppressor made of the same material as the fragment found on the crime scene. The plant fragments found on the suspension on the car were similar to the plants found at the crime scene. \n\nAccording to the official investigators, Bashayev was trying to smear Kadyrov and the leadership of the Chechen Republic, and he might also have been upset by publications by Estemirova where she had alleged that Bashayev had been recruiting for the rebel group without any opposition of the officials and suggested that he might be an agent for Kadyrovtsy.\n\nAccording to the official information, on 13 November 2009, Bashayev was killed by an air strike during a special operation led by Adam Delimkhanov. \n\n\"Novaya Gazeta\" journalists and human rights activists disagree with the conclusions of the investigators and suspect a massive cover-up: \n\n\n\n"}

The \"Kirkus Reviews\" noted that \"Flower Craft\" (1949) had \"Plenty of helpful lists ... sound advice ... with some original ideas.\" \"The Book of Table Arrangements\" (1951) was described as \"a \"goldmine\" for hostesses\". An arrangement from \"Flower Arrangements Throughout the Year\" appeared on the cover of the \"Australian Women's Weekly\" in 1963; Roberts was described as \"world famous as a lecturer on flower arrangements\". The journal \"Design\" considered \"How to Make Flower Decorations\" (1958) \"the authoritative book on the subject\", and \"Interior Design\" wrote that the \"easy instructions are spiced with so much common sense\". Her last book, \"Table Settings, Entertaining & Etiquette\", was published simultaneously in the US (by Viking) and in the UK (by Thames & Hudson). It was well received in both countries, with one reviewer describing it as \"a fascinating mixture of the social history of the dining room and practical advice on all kinds of entertaining\", and another saying it \"the book is both a visual delight and an infallible guide to correct procedure\".<br>\n\nRoberts' work was also featured in popular magazines of the period, including \"Look\", \"House Beautiful\", \"Woman’s Day\", \"Town and Country\", and \"Life\", which in 1956 carried a 6 page color spread of floral arrangements designed for it by Roberts. In addition, she appeared in and did arrangements and table settings for live lectures across the US and internationally, as well as radio and television programs and movies. In 1950 she was a commentator for the first televised broadcast of the New York Flower Show.\n\nRoberts also designed floral-themed interior decorations for established manufacturers, including W.H.Bossons of Congleton, England, for whom she designed the 'Sentimental Flowers' mirror and plaques; The Walter Hatches; and Beswick Pottery (she was one of several international experts in floral arrangements invited in the 1960s to design a vessel for flower arranging). She established the Patricia Roberts Studio in Stamford, Connecticut, to sell her own floral-themed interior decorations in various materials, including metal, which she also exported. She worked as a consultant on interior design and landscape design for Paparazzo Development Corporation's clustered-housing projects in Connecticut.\n\nRoberts' influential design ideas and etiquette guidelines are still referenced in the 21st century. The historical information she provided in \"Table Settings, Entertaining & Etiquette\" has been referenced by both academic studies and cookbooks with a historical theme.\n\nIn 1939, Roberts married David Edwards Roberts (an American lawyer for the Florists' Telegraph Delivery Association), with whom she had two children. Roberts and her husband divorced in 1947, and Roberts became a U.S. citizen in 1948. Roberts’ last twenty years (1967-1987) were spent living in Southbury, Connecticut. She died aged 77 of metastasized colon cancer on December 27, 1987 in a hospital in Danbury, Connecticut.\n\n"}
{"id": "7640956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7640956", "title": "Peter Pan", "text": "Peter Pan\n\nPeter Pan is a fictional character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates, mermaids, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.\n\nPeter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include a 1953 animated film, a 2003 dramatic/live-action film, a television series and many other works.\n\nJ. M. Barrie first used Peter Pan as a character in a section of \"The Little White Bird\" (1902), an adult novel where he appears as a seven-day-old baby in the chapter entitled \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens\". Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, Hodder and Stoughton, extracted chapters 13–18 of \"The Little White Bird\" and republished them in 1906 under the title \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens\", with the addition of illustrations by Arthur Rackham.\n\nHe returned to the character of Peter Pan as the centre of his stage play entitled \"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up,\" which premiered on 27 December 1904 in London. Barrie later adapted and expanded the play's story line as a novel, published in 1911 as \"Peter and Wendy\".\n\nBarrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves and cobwebs. His name and playing the flute or pipes suggest the mythological character Pan. Barrie mentions in \"Peter and Wendy\" that Peter Pan still had all his \"first teeth\". He describes him as a beautiful boy with a beautiful smile, \"clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that flow from trees\".\n\nTraditionally, the character has been played on stage by a petite adult woman. In the original productions in the UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by Nina Boucicault in 1904. This costume is exhibited in Barrie's Birthplace. The similar costume worn by Pauline Chase (who played the role from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the Museum of London. Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict a red costume but a green costume (whether or not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s, and more so later after the release of Disney's animated movie.\n\nIn the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed elf-like ears, brown eyes and his hair is red. In \"Hook\" (1991), the character is played as an adult by Robin Williams, with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. In this film his ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as Peter Banning. His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap). In the live-action 2003 \"Peter Pan\" film, he is portrayed by Jeremy Sumpter, who has blond hair and blue-green eyes. His outfit is made of leaves and vines.\n\nJ.M. Barrie created his character based on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy. The \"boy who wouldn't grow up\" character has been described as a variety of ages.\n\nPeter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such claims are questionable (such as congratulating himself when Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and book, Peter symbolises the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.\n\nPeter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in danger. Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going to die on Marooners' Rock, he felt scared, yet he felt only one shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, \"To die will be an awfully big adventure\". In the play, the unseen and unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that his cry might have become, \"To live would be an awfully big adventure!\", \"but he can never quite get the hang of it\".\n\nPeter's archetypal quality is his unending youth. In \"Peter and Wendy\", it is explained that Peter must forget his own adventures and what he learns about the world in order to stay childlike.\n\nPeter's ability to fly is explained, but inconsistently. In \"The Little White Bird\", he is able to fly because he is said to be part bird, like all babies. In the play and novel, he teaches the Darling children to fly using a combination of \"lovely wonderful thoughts\" and fairy dust. In Barrie's Dedication to the play \"Peter Pan, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow up\", the author attributes the idea of fairy dust being necessary for flight to practical needs:\n\n...after the first production I had to add something to the play at the request of parents (who thus showed that they thought me the responsible person) about no one being able to fly until the fairy dust had been blown on him; so many children having gone home and tried it from their beds and needed surgical attention. \nPeter has an effect on the whole of Neverland and its inhabitants when he is there. Barrie states that although Neverland appears different to every child, the island \"wakes up\" when Peter returns from his trip to London. In the chapter \"The Mermaids' Lagoon\" in the book \"Peter and Wendy\", Barrie writes that there is almost nothing that Peter cannot do. He is a skilled swordsman, rivalling even Captain Hook, whose hand he cut off in a duel. He has remarkably keen vision and hearing. He is skilled in mimicry, copying the voice of Hook and the ticking of the clock in the crocodile.\n\nPeter has the ability to imagine things into existence and he is able to feel danger when it is near.\n\nIn \"Peter and Wendy\", Barrie states that the Peter Pan legend Mrs Darling heard as a child was that when children died, he accompanied them part of the way to their destination so they would not be frightened. This is a role similar to the Greek god Hermes as a psychopomp.\n\nIn the original play, Peter states that no one must ever touch him (though he does not know why). The stage directions specify that no one does so throughout the play. Wendy approaches Peter to give him a \"kiss\" (thimble), but is prevented by Tinker Bell. However, John Caird and Trevor Nunn's introduction to the script for the 1997 Royal National Theatre production, states that this was never Barrie's original intention, and was only added for a production in 1927, where Jean Forbes-Robertson took the title role, and played the part with a lighter, more fairy-like, physicality. Robertson was to play the part almost every year until 1939.\n\nThe character's name comes from two sources: Peter Llewelyn Davies, one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired the story, and Pan, a minor deity of Greek mythology who plays pipes to nymphs and is part human and part goat. This is referenced in Barrie's works (particularly \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens\") where Peter Pan plays pipes to the fairies and rides a goat. The god Pan represents Nature or Man's natural state in contrast to Civilisation and the effects of upbringing on human behaviour. Peter Pan is a free spirit, being too young to be burdened with the effects of education or to have an adult appreciation of moral responsibility. As a 'betwixt-and-between', who can fly and speak the language of fairies and birds, Peter is part animal and part human. According to psychologist Rosalind Ridley, by comparing Peter's behaviour to adults and to other animals, Barrie raises many post-Darwinian questions about the origins of human nature and behaviour. As 'the boy who wouldn't grow up', Peter exhibits many aspects of the stages of cognitive development seen in children and can be regarded as Barrie's memory of himself as a child, being both charmingly childlike and childishly solipsistic.\n\nPeter Pan ran away from his parents when he was a baby as told in \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens\" and \"Peter and Wendy\". Finding the window closed and seeing a new baby in the house when he returned some time later, he believed his parents no longer wanted him and never came back. This younger sibling is referred to in the chapter \"Lock-Out Time\" in \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens\" but is not mentioned again.\n\nWhile in Kensington Gardens, Peter meets a lost girl named Maimie Mannering and the two quickly become friends. Peter proposes marriage to Maimie. While Maimie wants to stay in the Gardens with Peter, she comes to realise that her mother is so worried that she must return to her. Maimie promises to always remember Peter and goes back to her mother. When Maimie grows up, she continues to think of Peter, dedicating presents and letters to him. To remember Maimie, Peter rides the imaginary goat that Maimie created for him. She is considered to be the literary predecessor of Wendy Darling.\n\nWendy is hinted to have romantic feelings for Peter, but cannot be with him because of his inability to love back. In the 2003 film \"Peter Pan,\" the feeling is mutual. Captain Hook can only take away Peter's ability to fly by thoughts of Wendy leaving him, growing up, and replacing him with a husband. Wendy saves Peter by giving him her hidden kiss (signifying he is her true love); this gives him the will to live. In the movie \"Hook,\" an older Wendy implies that she used to (and perhaps, still does) have feelings for Peter, saying that she was shocked that he did not prevent her wedding day. In the sequel to the 1953 Disney film, \"Return to Neverland,\" Peter and a grown-up Wendy are briefly, but happily, reunited after many years and continue to show feelings for each other.\n\nIn the original novel, Peter later befriends Wendy's daughter Jane (and her subsequent daughter Margaret), and it is implied that this pattern will go on forever. From time to time Peter visits the real world, and befriends children. Wendy Darling, whom he recruited to be his \"mother\", is the most significant of them; he also brings her brothers John and Michael to Neverland at her request. It is mentioned that Wendy was the only girl who captured his attention.\n\nJohn, the older brother of the Darlings, proves to be extremely mature for his age. He becomes fascinated with piracy and imitates Captain Hook while playing at home with his siblings. Not only sophisticated, John is also courageous and smart. Peter typically tasks John with the responsibility of directing the Lost Boys when Peter is absent. Michael, the youngest of the Darlings, is convinced that Peter Pan is a real person after hearing Wendy's passionate narratives about him. During nursery games, it's Michael who plays the role of Peter Pan whom he looks up to.\n\nThe parents of Wendy, John and Michael. Mr Darling works as a clerk in the City, and is named after George Llewelyn Davies. Mrs Darling is named after Mary Ansell, Barrie's wife.\n\nTiger Lily is the daughter of Great Big Little Panther, the chief of the Piccaninny Native American tribe resident in Neverland. Barrie refers to her as \"a princess in her own right\", and she is often described as such. She is kidnapped by the pirates and left to die on Marooners' Rock, but is rescued by Peter. It is hinted later that she may have romantic feelings for Peter but he does not return them, as he is completely oblivious of other people's feelings. In the Disney film, Tiger Lily shows her gratitude by performing a dance for Peter and kissing him. The kiss makes him turn bright red, and makes Wendy jealous of Tiger Lily.\n\nTinker Bell is a common fairy who is Peter Pan's best friend and often jealously protective of him. She is the friend who helps him in his escapades. As his fairy, Tink’s malicious actions are usually caused by her jealousy which leads to the Lost Boys shooting arrows at Wendy (or nearly stoning her to death in the Disney film), and eventually even reveals Peter’s hideout to Captain Hook, thinking that Wendy will be captured rather than Peter. When Tink realises her serious mistake, she risks her own life by drinking the poison Hook has left for Peter (or pushing Hook’s bomb away in Disney's movie). Her extreme loyalty and dedication to Peter is everlasting.\n\nPeter is the leader of the Lost Boys, which include Tootles, Nibs, Slightly, Curly, and The Twins. The Lost Boys is a band of boys who were lost by their parents after they \"fall out of their perambulators\" and came to live in Neverland. In Barrie's novel \"Peter and Wendy\" (but not the original play \"Peter Pan\"), it is stated that Peter \"thins them out\" when they start to grow up. This is never fully explained, but it is implied that he either kills them or banishes them. \n\nIn the song \"I Won't Grow Up\" from the 1954 musical, the boys sing \"I will stay a boy forever\" to which Peter replies \"and be banished if I don't\". \n\nIn Peter Pan in Scarlet (2006), the official sequel to Barrie's \"Peter and Wendy\", what happens to the Lost Boys when they begin to grow up is revealed when Slightly starts to grow older, as Peter banishes him to Nowhereland (Which basically means that he and all his allies will ignore the banished person's existence), the home of all the Long Lost Boys whom Peter has banished in times past.\n\nThe crocodile (Tick-Tock in the Disney film) is Captain Hook's nemesis. After Peter Pan cut off Captain Hook's hand in a fight and threw it into the sea, the crocodile swallowed it and got a taste for Hook. It also swallowed a ticking clock, which alerts Hook of its presence.\n\nCaptain Hook, whose right hand was cut off in a duel, is Peter Pan's arch-enemy. Hook's crew, including Smee and Starkey, also consider him a foe. Captain Hook's two principal fears are the sight of his own blood (which is supposedly an unnatural colour) and one crocodile. His name plays on the iron hook that replaced his hand cut off by Peter Pan and eaten by a saltwater crocodile, which continues to pursue Hook.\n\nIn the 1953 animated film, Hook seeks revenge on Peter Pan for having fed the crocodile his hand, and refuses to leave Neverland without satisfaction. Hook is supported by Mr. Smee. After promising Tinker Bell 'not to lay a finger (or a hook) on Peter Pan', he lays a bomb in Peter's hideout. At the conclusion of the film, Hook is chased by the crocodile into the distance. Walt Disney insisted on keeping Hook alive, as he said: \"The audience will get to liking Hook, and they don't want to see him killed.\" In the sequel \"Return to Never Land\", Hook mistakes Wendy's daughter Jane for Wendy, and uses her as bait to lure Peter Pan to his death.\n\nMr. Smee is Captain Hook's boatswain (\"bo'sun\") and right-hand man in J. M. Barrie's play \"Peter Pan\" and the novel \"Peter and Wendy\". Mr. Smee is Captain Hook’s direct confidant. Unlike the other pirates, Smee is often clumsy and incapable of capturing any of the Lost Boys. Rather than engaging in Hook’s evil schemes, Smee finds excitement in bagging loot and treasures.\n\n\nThe name Peter Pan has been adopted for various purposes over the years:\n\nBarrie commissioned a statue of Peter Pan by sculptor George Frampton which was erected overnight in Kensington Gardens on 30 April 1912 as a May Day surprise to the children of London. Seven statues have been cast from the original mould. The other six are located in:\n\nOther statues are:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42936727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42936727", "title": "Richard Smoley", "text": "Richard Smoley\n\nRichard Smoley is an author and philosopher focusing on the world's mystical and esoteric teachings, particularly those of Western civilization.\n\nSmoley was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1956. He attended the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, and took a bachelor's degree \"magna cum laude\" in classics at Harvard University in 1978. Smoley went on to Oxford University, where in 1980, he received a second bachelor's degree from the Honour School of Literae Humaniores (in philosophy and classical literature). He received his M.A. from Oxford in 1985.\n\nWhile Smoley was at Oxford, he came in contact with a small group that was studying the Kabbalah, co-founded by the British Kabbalist and author Warren Kenton (Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi). Here Smoley was first introduced to many of the ideas he has discussed in his writings. Smoley subsequently started Kabbalah groups along similar lines in San Francisco, New York, and Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nSmoley moved to San Francisco in 1980. In 1982 he began working for \"California Farmer\" magazine, the state's leading agricultural publication, and became managing editor in 1983. Smoley helped broaden the magazine's coverage to include controversial topics such as organic farming, and the \"California Farmer\" helped bring organic farming into the agricultural mainstream. Smoley left \"California Farmer\" in 1988.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Smoley continued his spiritual investigations, working with Tibetan Buddhism, the teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff, and \"A Course in Miracles\". He was also a member of the board of directors of the now-defunct San Francisco Miracles Foundation, an organization sponsoring the work of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nIn 1986, Smoley started writing for a new magazine called \"Gnosis: A Journal of the Western Inner Traditions\", founded in San Francisco by Jay Kinney. After four years of writing for \"Gnosis\" and a brief stint as managing editor, he came on board as editor in November 1990. In his eight years as editor of \"Gnosis\", the magazine published issues on subjects as diverse as Gnosticism, Freemasonry, G.I. Gurdjieff, the spirituality of Russia, and psychedelics in spirituality. Smoley's interest in the Kabbalah influenced the magazine's coverage of that tradition. In 1998 \"Gnosis\" won \"Utne Reader’s\" award for best spiritual coverage. In 1999, largely for financial reasons, Gnosis ceased publication.\n\nSmoley moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he worked as guest editor for \"Leonardo, the journal of the International Society for the Arts Sciences and Technology, and subsequently to western Massachusetts, where he served as managing editor for the Anthroposophic Press (later renamed SteinerBooks) in Great Barrington. He briefly taught philosophy on an adjunct basis at Holyoke Community College in Holyoke, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 2005 Smoley began to work as acquisitions editor for Quest Books, the publishing arm of the Theosophical Society in America. In 2008, he became editor of \"Quest\", the journal of the Theosophical Society in America. He continues to hold both positions today.\n\nSmoley is a consulting editor to Parabola. He has served as guest editor of \"Science of Mind\" magazine, and works as a consultant for the New Century Edition of the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, sponsored by the Swedenborg Foundation in West Chester, Pennsylvania. In 2011 Smoley was elected to the board of directors of the Swedenborg Foundation.\n\nSmoley's publishing career began when he was an undergraduate at Harvard. He served as managing editor of \"The Harvard Advocate\", the university's literary magazine, in 1977. He also edited \"First Flowering: The Best of the Harvard Advocate, 1866-1976,\" a selection from the magazine that included undergraduate writings by figures such as T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, e.e. cummings, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. The collection included a foreword by the novelist Norman Mailer and a preface by the translator Robert Fitzgerald.\n\nAt Oxford, Smoley helped revive the dormant magazine of Corpus Christi College, \"The Pelican\", and published some short works in it.\n\nIn May 1999, Smoley's book \"Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions\", coauthored with Jay Kinney, was published by Penguin Arkana. A revised edition was issued by Quest Books in 2006, and an audio version was released by Audible.com in 2013. Chapters cover Carl Jung, Gnosticism, the Kabbalah, ritual magic, shamanism, alchemy, G.I. Gurdjieff, Sufism, the Rosicrucians, the Freemasons, Theosophy, and the New Age. Gustav Niebuhr, writing in the \"New York Times\", characterized the book as \"a new wide-ranging book about alternative spiritual paths.\" In \"Whole Earth\", Jeanne Carstensen commented that \"Hidden Wisdom\" displayed “both historical rigor and a wink toward the divine.”\n\nSmoley's second and best-known book, \"Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition\", was published in 2002 by Shambhala Publications. An audio version read by the author was released by Berkshire Media Artists in 2003. In his introduction, Smoley says he was inspired to write this book because there were at that point no good introductions to the mystical and esoteric traditions of Christianity, a situation he attempted to remedy. \"Library Journal\" characterized the book as \"a solid introduction to esoteric Christianity for the general reader.\" The magazine \"The Sun\" featured Smoley and his work in a lengthy interview in its September 2003 issue.\n\nIn January 2006, Tarcher/Penguin published \"The Essential Nostradamus\", Smoley's guide to the enigmatic prophet Michel de Nostradamus. The book contains new translations of Nostradamus's key prophecies, as well as an evaluation of his work and of prophecy in general. A second edition of this work appeared in 2011.\n\nIn 2006, Harper San Francisco (now Harper One) published Smoley's book \"Forbidden Faith: The Gnostic Legacy from the Gospels to \"The Da Vinci Code\"\". A paperback edition, retitled \"Forbidden Faith: The Secret History of Gnosticism\", appeared in 2007. In this book Smoley traces the history of Gnostic and other esoteric currents of Western civilization — including Manichaeism, Catharism, the Rosicrucian legacy, Freemasonry, Kabbalah, and Theosophy. It also explores how these currents have shaped modern trends and thinkers ranging from William Blake to Jung, and, in more recent times, Philip K. Dick and Harold Bloom.\n\nSmoley's book \"Conscious Love: Insights from Mystical Christianity\", was published in April 2008 by Jossey-Bass. His discussion of consciousness, causation, and the existence of God, \"The Dice Game of Shiva: How Consciousness Creates the Universe\", was published by New World Library in November 2009. In a review of this book for \"Parabola\", the magazine's executive editor, Tracy Cochran, wrote, \"With clarity and verve, [Smoley] lays out famous arguments and articulations of the conundrum of the nature of consciousness so that they sparkle like jewels on the dark velvet of starlight.\"\n\nSmoley's most recent books, \"The Deal: A Guide to Radical and Complete Forgiveness\" (2015) and \"Supernatural: Writings on an Unknown History\" (2013), were published by Tarcher/Penguin. \n\nSmoley is a frequent contributor to the Australian magazine \"New Dawn\" and he is an associate of the Institute of Cultural Inquiry, a Los Angeles-based organization devoted to cultural studies. He lectures on his work throughout the United States and occasionally abroad. Organizations that have sponsored his lectures and workshops include the Bodhi Tree bookstore (West Hollywood), the California Institute of Integral Studies (San Francisco), East-West Books (New York), the Kabbalah Society (London), the Lumen Foundation (San Francisco), the New York Open Center, the Swedenborg Foundation (West Chester, Pennsylvania), and the Theosophical Society in America (Wheaton, Illinois).\n\nSmoley's books show a certain progression in that his earlier works, particularly \"Hidden Wisdom\", are more descriptive of the ideas and teachings of others, notably those in the Western esoteric tradition, while his subsequent works, particularly \"Inner Christianity\", \"Conscious Love\", and \"The Dice Game of Shiva\", are devoted to expounding his own views, which he associates primarily with esoteric, or, as he styles it, “inner” Christianity.\n\nSmoley occupies a somewhat ambiguous position in regard to the academic study of esotericism, pioneered by Antoine Faivre at the Sorbonne and developed by such figures as Wouter Hanegraaff, Joscelyn Godwin, Arthur Versluis, and Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. On the one hand, Smoley has always shown high respect for the findings of academic scholarship in the field; on the other hand, he has also shown some concern that an overacademic approach will distort and devitalize the living esoteric tradition, of which he considers himself to be a part. In a 1993 editorial in \"Gnosis\", he wrote:\nLike Rappaccini’s daughter, the professors’ touch can prove poisonous. I have a degree in philosophy myself, so I have firsthand experience of how academic hairsplitting and pettifogging disputes over the meanings of words have all but killed that discipline. A glance into just about any theological treatise will leave one with the same impression. So I’m not sure that academic inquiry will really do justice to the spiritual traditions of the West, particularly since scholastics, from the time of Aquinas onward, have been notoriously bad at distinguishing intellectual knowledge from the deeper, experiential understanding called “gnosis.” Even Gershom Scholem, the great scholar of Jewish mysticism, was nicknamed “the accountant” by kabbalists because they saw his knowledge as being merely of the intellectual kind. \nSmoley elaborated on these comments in a 2006 address to the Association for the Study of Esotericism entitled “Academe and Esotericism: The Problem of Authority.” In terms of the distinction between the emics, who consider themselves to be part of the culture in question, and the etics, such as anthropologists, who study the culture from an outside, ostensibly “objective” view, Smoley could probably be best described as an etically informed emic. His view of esotericism (a word derived ultimately from a Greek adverb meaning 'further in') holds that it is not so much a matter of entering an inner circle of adepts but of going “further in” oneself in order to grasp deeper levels of consciousness. The various esoteric traditions would, then, serve as ways of making this journey within.\n\nSmoley's metaphysics and epistemology are intricately intertwined. His approach can be described as partially phenomenological, although he does not appear to be directly influenced by 20th-century phenomenologists such as Edmund Husserl or Maurice Merleau-Ponty. He posits a fundamental dichotomy that underlies the rest of his thought: between what he calls the “self” and the “other.” His theory of consciousness rests on this polarity; in fact he defines consciousness as “that which relates self and other.” In his 2009 work \"The Dice Game of Shiva\", Smoley, drawing inspiration from the Hindu philosophical school known as the Samkhya, equates this self and other with the terms \"purusha\" and \"prakriti\" respectively.\n\nConsciousness in this sense extends far past waking human awareness, which Smoley sees as only one level of a continuum that also includes the consciousness of other living beings as well as the inanimate world down to at least the atomic level. To this effect he quotes an 1890 interview with Thomas Edison:\n“I do not believe,” [Edison] said, “that matter is inert, acted upon by an outside force. To me it seems that every atom is possessed by a certain amount of primitive intelligence. Look at the thousands of ways in which atoms of hydrogen combine with those of other elements, forming the most diverse substances. Do you mean to say that they do this without intelligence?...Gathered together in certain forms, the atoms constitute animals of the lower orders. Finally they combine in man, who represents the total intelligence of all the atoms.”\nSmoley adds, “If an atom could not take a stance in the physical world and draw a line between itself and what is not itself, it could not exist.”\n\nSmoley characterizes human consciousness in terms of his contrast of self and other. In this case, however, he uses slightly different terminology, often speaking of “I” and “the world.” The “I,” or “true I” (he uses both expressions), in his view, is not the ordinary ego but a deeper, transpersonal entity that simply sees or experiences. He explicitly equates this “I” with a number of concepts from the world's spiritual traditions. This true “I” — the consciousness that looks out at the world through each of us as through so many windows — has many names. Esoteric Christianity calls it the Son; the Logos; Sophia, or “wisdom”; or the kingdom of heaven. For the Hindus it is \"atman\"; the Dzogchen tradition of Tibetan Buddhism speaks of it as \"rigpa\", “pure consciousness”; other Buddhists call it “Buddha nature or simply “mind.” You can never see it, because it is that which sees. Francis of Assisi alluded to this when he said, “What we are looking for is what is looking.”\n\nOver and against this “I,” which is “that which experiences,” Smoley posits that which “is experienced — whether inside ourselves or outside.” This statement highlights one unusual aspect of Smoley's views. He claims that it is possible to step back and look at the contents of one's own psyche as if it belonged to a third party. In one meditative exercise that he gives, he says, “even your most intimate feelings and desires will pass before you like images on a screen.” Thus for Smoley, even what is usually seen as the internal realm of the psyche is part of the “world” that is experienced.\n\nSmoley relates these observations to the ancient Christian division of the body, soul, and spirit, which, he claims, has become obscured over the centuries. The body, that is, the physical body, constitutes one level. The psyche (which he explicitly equates with the soul, on the grounds that in most versions of the New Testament the Greek word translated as “soul” is psyche) is the total constellation of an individual's thoughts, images, and feelings, conscious and unconscious. The third element, the spirit, the “I” or “true I,” as he puts it, “seems to have no power, no volition of its own, yet it is that in you which is constantly awake and experiences all that passes for your life.”\n\nSmoley claims that the sum total of experiences, physical and psychological, are what esoteric Christianity calls “the world.” Thus he uses this term in a more specific sense than has generally been done. For Smoley, the Gospel of John in particular, with its frequent and emphatic contrast of “I” with “the world” (e.g., “Be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world”; John 16:33), is an exposition of this fundamental duality.\nThis isolated “I” that does nothing other than cognize would seem to lead to a type of solipsism. Smoley counters this by another assertion: that this “I” is part of a larger, collective “I” that encompasses the whole human race. He connects this idea with the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, the primordial man, as well as with the \"maximus homo\" or “universal human” of the 18t-century Swedish visionary Emanuel Swedenborg. He quotes the French esotericist Papus (Gérard Encausse) to this effect: “Adam does not represent an individual man, but rather the sum total of all men and women in their ulterior differentiation.”\nIn Smoley's “inner Christianity,” “Adam” symbolizes the human entity in its fragmented, isolated state. As in many instances, Smoley discounts the literal meaning of the Bible in favor of an esoteric sense. The fall of Adam and Eve, he contends, was caused by the desire of this cosmic Adam to know good and evil (symbolized by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil: Genesis 2:17). Smoley quotes Papus again to the effect that after the fall, “each cell of Adam became an individual human being.” But Smoley also emphasizes that this fall cannot be placed on a historical timeline, but was a cosmic event that preceded (and may have given rise to) the existence of the universe as we now know it. Because this fall would be an event that takes place outside the dimensions of space and time, Smoley's view neither conflicts nor concurs with contemporary scientific cosmologies.\n\nAccording to Smoley, esoteric Christianity symbolizes humanity in its fallen state of individuality by Adam. The restored human unity, the reintegrated \"maximus homo\", is symbolized by Christ: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Corinthians 15:22). He explicitly relates his views to conceptions of the cosmic Christ and the Catholic doctrine of the mystical body of Christ.\n\nSmoley's theology parallels his dichotomy of “I” and “the world.” Although he does not posit this dichotomy as absolute, contending that it arises out of a groundless being (or nonbeing) in which self and other are not distinguished, he insists that it is fundamental to the way we experience the world. While one may be able to transcend this duality through, say, mystical experience, it is very difficult to speak about, or conceptualize, this transcendence. He contends that this fact helps explain many of the apparently paradoxical or incomprehensible utterances of many mystics.\n\nSmoley's view of God recapitulates this position. “God is both wholly Self and wholly other. To put it more comprehensively still, God is the ultimate source out of which this duality of self and other arises.” He adds, “God is \"purusha\", Self, that which sees; it is that which is most profoundly and intimately ‘I.’ God is also other, \"prakriti\", the ‘world,’ that which is seen. How the divine is revealed is a matter, almost, of the stance from which we see it.”\n\nBecause this “ultimate source” is infinite, it is unlikely to be personal in the sense that orthodox Christianity maintains. “If God is the ultimate ground of being out of which all arises, it must necessarily follow that God is not a person or persons as we customarily understand them.” At the same time, Smoley contends, its very infinitude also includes the capacity to manifest in a personal form. “Whether or not God is ultimately personal in the sense that we humans understand it, the tradition suggests that we are persons, and God can address us in ways we can understand — that is, personally.”\nSmoley's view of the Father and Son (in Christian terms) resembles the “subordinationist” view found in such figures as Philo of Alexandria and Origen. The Father is the transcendent aspect of God; the Son is the imminent aspect, which he equates with the Logos and Sophia, or the “primal level of consciousness,” or the “true I.” Smoley does not identify this principle with the historical Jesus in any kind of exclusive or privileged way: “This primal level of consciousness...is the deepest part of us, as it is of everything that exists.”\n\nSmoley's Christology must be understood in the light of these ideas. He appears to accept most current scholarship about the historical Jesus, which, beginning with David Friedrich Strauss in the 19th century, posits that much of what appears in the Gospels is mythical or legendary. Smoley's Christology thus departs radically from those of most Christian denominations, but he insists that this has always been known within the esoteric Christian tradition. He concurs with Origen, who says, “In the gospels...events which did not take place at all are woven into the records of what literally did happen.”\nUnlike Origen, however, and most other Christian sources, Smoley regards Jesus as no more divine than anyone else. He quotes \"A Course in Miracles\" (a text he cites frequently), which, speaking about Jesus, says, “Is he the Christ? O yes, along with you.” In fact Smoley appears to accept the Christology of \"A Course in Miracles\", which portrays Jesus as the figure who, through his crucifixion and particularly his resurrection, crucially reversed the fall of the cosmic “Adam,” but only as a kind of first among equals in the human race.\n\nSmoley's views on love can be found in their most comprehensive form in his 2008 book \"Conscious Love\". If consciousness is “that which relates self and other,\" then “love is what unites self and other.”\nBroadly speaking, Smoley defines two types of love. The first is “transactional love or worldly love,” which is “calculated, calculating, and exact.” Most forms of love in ordinary life, he contends, are transactional in this sense, even those we do not customarily regard as such. For example, “it seems unlikely that transactionality ever totally vanishes from romantic love, even at its most exalted.”\nIn regard to sexual love, Smoley's views are comparatively open-minded and accepting. “Love is sometimes expressed in a bonding for life, sometimes in a brief affair, or occasionally even in a thing as transient as a one-night stand. Sometimes it is virginal, sometimes whorish...[H]uman love takes as many forms as imagination and feasibility will permit, and if it seems to break the rules on countless occasions, this only serves to remind us that rules are not gods.”\nThe same is the case with his views on homosexuality. He writes: \"On the one hand, if homosexuality is unnatural, why has it persisted for so long in the face of so much opposition? On the other hand, if homosexuality is natural, what purpose does it serve?... The most obvious conclusion is that homosexuality seems to fulfill some role in nature that is not well understood. For the time being, we would probably be best served neither by condemning it nor by cooking up factitious reasons for its existence.\" He then goes on to say, “From an ultimate perspective, there’s probably nothing uniquely privileged about the union between man and woman.”\nWhile Smoley does not completely reject the popular idea of “soul mates” (which can be traced back to Plato's Symposium), he does display considerable skepticism about it. “What of the enormous numbers of people—single, divorced, or unhappily married—who have never found their soul mates? What of those of us who lead lives of serial monogamy? Or polyamory and polyfidelity? Or prostitution? (The ancients in Babylonia knew that there is a sacred element even to this most despised and downtrodden of all professions.) All these types of relationships exist, have always existed, and to all appearances will continue to exist.”\nIn \"Conscious Love\", Smoley goes on to characterize the transactional elements present in marriage, family love, and friendship. To all these he contrasts the Christian \"agape\", unconditional or “conscious love,” a phrase he has taken from the teachings of Gurdjieff. \"Agape\", in Smoley's view, comes from a recognition of “the I that is we”—a realization that the true “I” of the individual is at core identical to the “I” of all other humans and indeed all other beings:\n\nThe “love of the world,” with its accounts, transactions, and agendas, is the love of Adam in his fallen state, in which each cell of his body imagines that it is...isolated and supreme and so finds itself fighting for position with so many other beings who deludedly believe the same thing. It is as if the cosmic Adam had been infected with an autoimmune disease.\n\n\"Agape\" is the love of the cosmic Christ, in which each cell of Adam recognizes that it is joined to the larger whole, that what in it says “I” at the deepest level is identical to that which says “I” in everything else, human and nonhuman. Because this is the truth, to realize it is to achieve gnosis, to become conscious in the fullest sense. Hence “conscious love.” \nSmoley's contrast of “conscious love” with “transactional love” resembles the contrast between the “holy relationship” and the “special relationship” in \"A Course in Miracles\". Given Smoley's evident interest in this text, it is curious that he does not make any explicit reference to these ideas in \"Conscious Love\".\n\nUnlike many writers on esoteric subjects, Smoley shows considerable skepticism toward prophecy, writing that “prophecies of an imminent end have all failed over and over again for the last two millennia, so the soundest conclusion is that there is nothing in them.”\nIn his book \"The Essential Nostradamus\", Smoley attempts to root Nostradamus in his own context in 16th-century France. He contends, for example, that the mysterious figure Hister mentioned in Nostradamus's prophecies was not, as is often claimed, a prophecy of Adolf Hitler but a metonymy for the Austrian Empire of the time, on the grounds that Ister (modified by Nostradamus to “Hister”) is an ancient name for the Danube, the principal river of Austria.\nSmoley's general attitude toward his subject can be summed up thusly: “I would not base any of my future plans of expectations on anything Nostradamus predicted or is imagined to have predicted.”\n\nElsewhere in the book Smoley discusses the larger dilemma faced by those who try to predict the future:\n\nThe scientific or quasi-scientific futurologist can base his forecasts only on the continuation of current trends. And yet if we know nothing else about the future, it is that current trends do not continue. There are disruptions, dislocations, surprises. The futurologist cannot foresee these.\n\nThe apocalyptic prophet faces no such restrictions. He has no incentive to predict more of the same; who would read him then? Consequently, he is entirely happy to foretell all kinds of upheavals, natural and supernatural—the submerging of continents, the manifestation of extraterrestrials, the shifting of the earth’s pole, the return of Jesus Christ. In one sense, he too is right. Cataclysms do occur. But somehow they never occur in the way they were predicted.\n\nIn an afterword prepared for the second edition of \"The Essential Nostradamus\", Smoley is also skeptical about the then-current prophecies regarding 2012: “It seems ridiculous to me to single out specific dates.” He does, however, add that expectations focused on individual years highlight a belief in, and need for, a collective awakening of the human race.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After completing her education, Bronson became the first Guidance and Placement Officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. She then served as executive secretary for the National Congress of American Indians and created their legislative news service. After a decade of work in Washington, D.C., Bronson moved to Arizona and served as a health education specialist for the Indian Health Service and was honored upon her retirement from government service by the Oveta Culp Hobby Service Award from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. She continued working for Native American rights for involvement in their own development and leadership in the private sector until her death.\n\nRuth Margaret Muskrat was born on October 3, 1897 in White Water, on the Delaware Nation Reservation in Indian Territory to Ida Lenora (née Kelly), of Irish-English stock and a transplant from Missouri, and James Ezekial Muskrat, a Cherokee, whose forebearers had made the Trail of Tears from Georgia to Indian Territory in the 19th century. When she was ten years old, she witnessed the disruption caused to the lives of her nation when the Curtis Act of 1898, an amendment of the Dawes Act, extended allotment over the Five Civilized Tribes. At the age of fourteen, she enrolled in preparatory school at the Oklahoma Institute of Technology in Tonkawa, graduating in 1916. She went on to further her education at Henry Kendall College in Tulsa and at Northeastern State Teachers College. Financial hardship then forced her to stop her education briefly and teach for two years to earn sufficient funds to continue her schooling.\n\nIn 1919, Muskrat enrolled at the University of Oklahoma, where she spent three semesters. During the summer of 1921, she was sent to work on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico by the YWCA. Her report on her organizing efforts there, earned her a scholarship to attend the University of Kansas, where she spent three more semesters of study. In 1922, Muskrat went to Peking, China as part of a YWCA delegation for the youth conference. She was one of the first Native American girls to serve as a student delegate abroad. The trip, which also included stops in \"Hawaii, Manchuria, Japan, Korea and Hong Kong\" brought Muskrat to the attention of the international press and awoke in her a desire for racial equality. The following year, she delivered an appeal to the United States government for better educational facilities for Native Americans. The presentation was part of a gathering of Native American leaders, known as the \"Committee of One Hundred\" to advise the president on American Indian policy. Muskrat advocated for Indians to be involved in solving their own problems. Moved by her speech, President Calvin Coolidge and his wife, Grace, invited Muskrat to lunch with them. In 1923, she enrolled in Mount Holyoke College and in 1925 graduated with a BA in English. During her college days, Muskrat was a prolific poet influenced by the Modernist movement.\n\nAs soon as she graduated, Muskrat began working at the Haskell Institute first as a teacher, and then as the head of the college placement bureau. She won the Henry Morgenthau Prize in 1926 for best use of her college education in the first year after completing her education. In 1928, Muskrat married John F. Bronson and they adopted a native girl. In 1931, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) created a new program to improve educational opportunities for Native Americans. Bronson was appointed as the first Guidance and Placement Officer of the bureau and tasked with helping graduates find viable employment. In 1937, she was awarded the Indian Achievement Medal of the Indian Council Fire, as the second woman to have received the award since its inception. She had previously been nominated for the award in its inaugural year in 1933. Bronson was in charge of distributing government loans and scholarships for students as well as helping them find job placements. She remained in the post for the BIA until 1943.\nBronson spent a few years raising her daughter, though she did publish several books and articles including \"Indians are People Too\" (1944), \"The Church in Indian Life\"(1945) and \"Shall We Repeat Indian History in Alaska?\" (1947) in this period. In 1945, Bronson began working with the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and soon emerged as a leader. She was appointed as the executive secretary of the organization and spent a decade monitoring legislative issues. She established the NCAI's legislative news service and spoke at various tribal meetings throughout the country, promoting Native American progress. Some of the issues Bronson was involved with at the NCAI were the debates over native water rights along the Colorado River, native rights in the Territory of Alaska, and medical care for American Indians. After ten years of serving as executive secretary, in 1955, Bronson was elected as treasurer of the NCAI in 1955, but she was tired of the contentiousness of national politics and began focusing more on ways to work with local communities.\n\nIn 1957, Bronson moved to Arizona and became a health education specialist at the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation for the Indian Health Service. During the same period, she served as a vice president of the philanthropic ARROW Organization. She managed the education loan and scholarship fund of the organization, as well as advising tribes on community development. In 1962, Bronson was awarded the Oveta Culp Hobby Service Award from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for her work serving Native Americans and retired from government service, moving to Tucson. In 1963, Bronson became the national program chairman of the Community Development Foundation’s American Indian section. The organization operated under the umbrella of the Save the Children Federation. After a stroke in 1972, Bronson slowed, but did not stop her activism for Native Americans to be allowed to determine their own development and leadership programs. In 1978, Bronson was one of the recipients of the National Indian Child Conference's merit award for commitment to improving children's quality of life.\n\nBronson died on June 12, 1982 in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n"}

Since the 1960s, he has made notable efforts to commemorate the Jewish victims of German-occupied France and has been a supporter of Israel.\n\nHe helped found and has led the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France (\"Association des fils et filles des déportés juifs de France)\" or FFDJF. It is one of the groups that has documented cases and located former German and French officials for prosecution such as Klaus Barbie, René Bousquet, Jean Leguay, Maurice Papon and Paul Touvier, who have been implicated in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of French and foreign Jews during the Second World War. The Klarsfelds were among organised groups who filed cases decades after the war, sometimes as late as the 1990s, against such officials for their crimes against humanity.\n\nIn the years before 1989 and the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Klarsfelds (Serge Klarsfeld and his wife Beate) frequently protested against the Eastern Bloc's support for the PLO and anti-Zionism.\n\nRecognition for their work has included France's Legion of Honour in 1984. In 1986, their story was adapted as an American television film starring Tom Conti, Farrah Fawcett and Geraldine Page. In 2008, a French television movie was made about them.\n\nOn 1 January 2014, the Klarsfelds' Legion of Honour ranks were upgraded: Serge became \"Grand officier\".\n\nOn 26 October 2015, the UNESCO designate the Klarsfelds as \"Honourary Ambassadors and Special Envoys for Education about the Holocaust and the Prevention of Genocide\".\n\nSerge Klarsfeld was born in Bucharest into a family of Romanian Jews. They migrated to France before the Second World War began. In 1943, his father was arrested by the SS in Nice during a roundup ordered by Alois Brunner. Deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, Klarsfeld's father died there. Young Serge was cared for in a home for Jewish children operated by the OSE (Œuvre de secours aux enfants) organization; his mother and sister also survived the war in Vichy France, helped by the underground French Resistance beginning in late 1943.\n\nSerge married Beate Künzel in 1963 and settled in Paris. Their son, (born 1965), became a human rights attorney and worked for Nicolas Sarkozy while he was minister of the interior.\n\nIn 2012 the archivist of the Stasi revealed that Beate Klarsfeld's attack on German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger by publicly slapping him on 7 November 1968 was carried out in agreement with and the support of the government of East Germany, which was conducting a campaign against West German politicians (see Braunbuch). Beate Klarsfeld was paid 2,000 DM by the Stasi for her actions. Both Serge and Beate Klarsfeld were revealed to have been regular Stasi contacts. According to the State Commissioner for the Stasi Archives of Saxony, they cooperated with the Stasi in the 1960s in blackmailing West German politicians for Second World War activities.\n\nIn 1974, Serge and Beate Klarsfeld were both convicted in West Germany on felony charges of attempted kidnapping of Kurt Lischka, a former Gestapo chief, in Cologne in order to transport him to France for prosecution. After conviction of felony charges, they were each sentenced to two months in prison. (His prosecution in Germany was prevented by legal technicalities resulting from a prior conviction). Following international protests, the sentence was suspended. Activism by the Klarsfelds and by descendants of Lischka's victims eventually resulted in changes to the laws. In 1980, Lischka was convicted of a felony in West Germany and sentenced to prison.\n\nThe Klarsfelds' activities and methods generated controversy. On 9 July 1979, the Klarsfelds were the targets of car bombing at their home in France. No one was in the car when the bomb detonated, and no one was injured in the vicinity of the blast. Individuals purporting to represent the Nazi ODESSA claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThey are notable in the postwar decades for having been involved in hunting and finding German Nazis and French Vichy officials responsible for the worst abuses of the Holocaust, in order to prosecute them for alleged war crimes. Several officials were indicted due in part to the work of the Klarsfelds; they included the following, with the years of their convictions or deaths in parentheses: \n\nIn the 1970s the Klarsfelds considered kidnapping Barbie in much the same way the Mossad did Eichmann but the plan fell through. They decided instead to bring international pressure to force his extradition.\n\nBy 1995, only four senior French Vichy officials had been indicted for war crimes, and by that year, only Paul Touvier had stood trial. Like Touvier, the former Vichy official Maurice Papon was convicted of war crimes in 1998.\n\nThe Klarsfelds continued to publicize the wartime activities of prominent politicians in Germany and Austria. In 1986 the Klarsfelds campaigned against former United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, who was elected President of Austria amid allegations that he had covered up his wartime activities as an officer in the Wehrmacht.\n\nIn 1996, during the warfare in the former Yugoslavia, the Klarsfelds joined the outcry against Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić for alleged war crimes and genocide of Bosnian Muslims.\n\nIn December 2009, Serge Klarsfeld defied an existing consensus within the Jewish community by saying that the beatification of Pope Pius XII was an internal matter of the Church. He said that Jews should not get too involved in the process. Many Jews were protesting the beatification, as they said that Pius XII had contributed to the persecution of Jews throughout Europe, and had not brought the power of the church against the Nazis for their mistreatment of Jews and other persecuted peoples.\n\nIn France in 1979 the Klarsfelds created \"l'Association des fils et filles des déportés juifs de France\" (Association of the sons and daughters of Jews deported from France) or FFDJF. It defends the cause of the descendants of deportees, to have the events recognised and to prosecute people responsible. In 1981, the association commissioned a memorial in Israel to the deported French Jews; it bears the name, date and place of birth of 80,000 French victims of the Nazi extermination. About 80,000 trees were planted to shape a forest of remembrance. Serge Klarsfeld is also Vice-President of the Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah.\n\nIn 1989 FFDJF was one of the groups to file a case against René Bousquet, head of the French Police in the Vichy government, for crimes against humanity. He was indicted by the French government in 1991, but killed in 1993 shortly before his trial was to begin.\n\nThe Klarsfelds' work on behalf of the descendants of Jewish deportees was formally recognised by President Jacques Chirac in a 1995 speech. He acknowledged the nation's responsibility for the fate of Jews in its territory during the Second World War. The government passed a law on 13 July 2000 to establish compensation for orphans whose parents were victims of anti-Semitic persecution.\n\nOn 7 July 2010, Serge Klarsfeld was awarded the title of commandeur de la Légion d'honneur by Prime Minister François Fillon at Hôtel Matignon, the official residence of France's Prime Minister.\n\nIn January 2012, the Klarsfelds, along with prominent French-Armenian singer Charles Aznavour, director Robert Guédiguian, and philosophers Bernard-Henri Lévy and Michel Onfray, signed an appeal to the French Parliament to ratify a bill to establish penalties for people who deny the Armenian Genocide.\n\nIn July 2018, the Klarsfelds were profiled at length on CNN, which noted their swing away from Nazi hunting to a more-general push for social justice in opposition to the modern right. Today, they fight for human life, freedom, and social protection.\n\nSince the reunification of Germany and the opening of Stasi files, in 2012 Lutz Rathenow, the State Commissioner for the Stasi Archives of Saxony, has stated that Beate Klarsfeld cooperated with the Stasi of East Germany in the 1960s. They gave her material containing incriminating information about the wartime activities of West German politicians. The cooperation of both Beate and Serge Klarsfeld with the Stasi and their status as contacts was also documented in a new book by former Stasi officers, Günter Bohnsack and Herbert Brehmer.\n\nIn May 2015, Beate Klarsfeld and her husband Serge received the German Federal Cross of Merit, in recognition of their efforts to bring Nazi war criminals to justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Olin was a right-handed submarining relief pitcher for the Cleveland Indians from 1988 to 1992. Olin died in a 1993 boating accident while still an active MLB player.\n\nSteve Olin was born on October 4, 1965 in Portland, Oregon, and grew up in nearby Beaverton. He graduated from Beaverton High School in 1984, and was recruited by baseball coach Jack Dunn to attend Portland State University.\n\nIn 195 career games, Olin pitched 273 innings and posted a win–loss record of 16–19, with 48 saves, 118 games finished, and a 3.10 earned run average (ERA). He earned his final win on September 9, 1992 against the Milwaukee Brewers. Noteworthy, as that was the game in which Robin Yount recorded his 3,000th career hit, though fellow pitcher José Mesa actually gave up the hit earlier in the game. Olin won the game in relief when Cleveland scored two runs in the top of the ninth.\n\nOlin was killed in a boating accident during spring training of 1993 on Little Lake Nellie in Clermont, Florida. The boat he was in struck a pier, killing him and fellow reliever Tim Crews and seriously injuring Bob Ojeda. Crews, who was piloting the boat, was legally drunk at the time; Olin and Ojeda only had negligible traces of alcohol in their bodies. It was the first death of active major league players since Thurman Munson in 1979. In response to the accident that took Olin and Crews in 1993, the Indians wore a patch on the sleeves of their jerseys. It consisted of a baseball with their numbers on it. Olin's #31 is on the left, with an arrow above. Crews' #52 is on the right, with a star above it.\n\nThe Beatles song \"Yellow Submarine\" has a unique meaning in Cleveland, since it was played before each of submariner Olin's appearances for the Indians in home games.\n\nAnother song remembered by Cleveland locals is \"The Dance\" by Garth Brooks. The song, a favorite of Olin, was played when the Indians clinched the 1995 American League Central Division. Before the game, then manager Mike Hargrove phoned the Indians scoreboard room requesting that it be played when the Indians clinched. \n\n\n"}

Today, the larger part of this population is concentrated in Northern Thrace, but much is spread across the whole of Bulgaria and the diaspora. \n\nUntil the beginning of the twentieth century the Thracian Bulgarians lived also in the whole of Thrace, then part of the Ottoman Empire. After the persecutions during the Preobrazhenie Uprising and the ethnic cleansing, caused to the Bulgarian population in Eastern Thrace after the Second Balkan War, these people were expelled from the area. After World War I, Bulgaria was required to cede Western Thrace to Greece. A whole population of Bulgarians in Western Thrace was expelled into Bulgaria-controlled Northern Thrace. This was followed by a further population exchange between Bulgaria and Greece (under the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine), which radically changed the demographics of the region toward increased ethnic homogenization within the territories each respective country ultimately was awarded. At this period the Bulgarian Communist Party was compelled by Comintern to accept the formation of a new \"Thracian nation\" on the base of this people in order to include them in a new separate \"Thracian state\", as a part of a future Balkan Communist Federation.\n\nThe last flow of Thracian refugees into Bulgaria was as the Bulgarian Army pulled out of the Serres-Drama region in late 1944.\n\nWith the accession of Bulgaria into the European Union, Bulgarian authorities appear to revisit the issue as a precondition for Turkey's membership to the Union.\n\n"}

From 1908 she toured regularly with Charles Wakefield Cadman, a composer and pianist who gave lectures about Native American music that were accompanied by his compositions and her singing. He composed classically based works associated with the Indianist movement. They toured in the United States and Europe.\n\nShe collaborated with him and Nelle Richmond Eberhart on the libretto of the opera \"Shanewis\" (or \"The Robin Woman,\" 1918), which was based on her semi-autobiographical stories and contemporary issues for Native Americans. It premiered at the Metropolitan Opera. Redfeather sang the title role when the opera was on tour, making her debut when the work was performed in Denver in 1924, and also performing in it in Los Angeles in 1926.\n\nAfter her performing career, she worked as an activist on Indian education, co-founding the American Indian Education Foundation. She also supported Native American archeology and ethnology, serving on the Board of Managers for the School of American Research founded in Santa Fe by Alice Cunningham Fletcher.\n\nTsianina Redfeather was born Florence \"Tsianina\" Evans at Eufaula, in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), to Creek and Cherokee parents. She trained as a classical singer in Denver, Colorado, sponsored in part by Alice Robertson.\n\nAt age 26, Redfeather joined American pianist Charles Wakefield Cadman on tour, giving recitals throughout North America. Cadman, who was white, had studied Native American music from ethnology sources and was lecturing on it, starting in 1908. He also was creating work drawn from Indian music. In the summer of 1909 he went to Nebraska, where he studied Omaha and Winnebago music on the reservations. He also learned to play some traditional instruments.\n\nBeginning in 1908, Cadman conducted lecture tours speaking about American Indian music and performed recitals on the subject, including his own songs, and accompanied by Redfeather as singer. They toured both in the United States and later in Europe, so she became known internationally. As \"Princess Tsianina Redfeather\", she performed Cadman's compositions wearing traditional costume, with her hair in long braids. She beaded her own garments. Cadman's composition \"From The Land of Sky-Blue Water\" became Redfeather's signature song.\n\nShe collaborated with Cadman and his librettist Nelle Richmond Eberhart in creating the opera \"Shanewis\" (or \"The Robin Woman\"). Its contemporary plot was loosely based on Redfeather's semi-autobiographical stories of Native American life, and was set in California and Oklahoma. The work debuted at the Metropolitan Opera in 1918 and was performed also the next season. Highly popular, it toured the United States. Tsianina sang the lead at some performances on tour, making her opera debut in the role in Denver in 1924. She reprised it in 1926 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring World War I in 1918, Redfeather was the head of a YMCA-sponsored troupe of Native American entertainers who toured France and Germany, performing for American troops. The title of the show was \"The Indian of yesterday and today.\" She described the others as \"twenty Indian boys\". General John J. Pershing honored her as one of the first women to volunteer to entertain the troops. She was the first woman to cross the Rhine to reach US troops in Germany.\n\nIn 1935, Redfeather retired from singing but was active in working on Indian issues. She was one of the founders of the American Indian Education Foundation (AIEF).\n\nShe also served for 30 years on the Board of Managers for the School of American Research in Santa Fe. Intended to promote archeological and ethnological research in the United States related to Native Americans, the institute was founded by ethnologist Alice Cunningham Fletcher. Amateur archaeologist Edgar Lee Hewett, who had achieved some status and donated substantial money to the school, was made director. Redfeather recounted that upon meeting Hewett, he told her that he admired the shape of her head and hoped to have it for his museum after she died. \"He frightened me,\" she recalled, \"and I had a secret fear of having my skull on display for all to see.\"\n\nIn 1920 Redfeather married David F. Balz of Denver. After they divorced, she remarried. Her second husband was named Blackstone. They also divorced.\n\nRedfeather became a devout Christian Scientist later in life. She eventually settled in California, where she lived with her niece Wynemah Blaylock (sometimes spelled Blalock) in Burbank. They later moved to San Diego.\n\nIn 1981 Redfeather was baptized in the Catholic faith at St. John's Church in San Diego. After Redfeather died in 1985, age 102, a funeral mass for her was held at St. John's. Her niece said she was descended from \"Indian royalty.\"\n"}
{"id": "304829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304829", "title": "Wesley Willis", "text": "Wesley Willis\n\nWesley Lawrence Willis (May 31, 1963 – August 21, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter and visual artist. Diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1989, Willis began a career as an underground singer-songwriter in the outsider music tradition, with songs featuring his bizarre, humorous and often obscene lyrics sung over the auto accompaniment feature on his Technics KN keyboard.\n\nWillis gained a large cult following in the 1990s, particularly after the release of his 1995 \"Greatest Hits\" album on the Alternative Tentacles label. Jello Biafra compiled the album's track list. In addition to a large body of solo musical work, Willis fronted his own punk rock band, the Wesley Willis Fiasco, during the 1990s. He was also a visual artist long before he developed an interest in music, and produced hundreds of intricate, unusual, colored ink-pen drawings, most of them of various Chicago streetscapes; he frequently sold these on the street for between $20 and $40.\n\nDespite his mainly underground career, Willis has influenced a variety of media: for example, music software company Nullsoft took their slogan \"It really whips the llama's ass!\" for Winamp from Willis's song \"Whip The Llama's Ass\".\n\nWillis was born in Chicago, Illinois on May 31, 1963, to Walter and Annie Willis. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Willis grew up in Chicago's projects as one of 10 children of parents who had a violent relationship and separated when he was young; he spent time in several foster homes and was essentially raised by two older brothers, who went with him from home to home.\" Willis began hearing voices during a period of living at his mother's home in the 1980s, when her boyfriend held a gun to his head and robbed him of $100 Willis had saved. By the end of the 1980s, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and institutionalized for two months after his diagnosis.\n\nDuring childhood, Willis developed an interest in art, and in 1988, he was featured in a Chicago public access documentary feature entitled \"Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets\". In \"Artist of the Streets\", he was shown walking through Chicago's Loop neighborhood, producing his ink pen drawings outside of the Marshall Field and Company Building, and interacting with people curious about his art. The drawings typically encompass detailed Chicago streetscapes, including buildings, vehicles, trees, and landmarks. Willis was known for his ability to draw from memory a completely different location than the one in which he was sitting. During his lifetime, he frequently gave his drawings away to friends or sold them for small amounts (typically $10 or $20) in Chicago parks. However, after his death, Willis began to receive recognition in the art community for his large body of visual art. In 2008 his artwork was exhibited at the Mohamed Khalil Museum of Egypt, and he was the subject of a special exhibit entitled \"Drawn By Wesley Willis\" at Dominican University.\n\nIn 1991, after befriending some musicians from Chicago's alternative rock scene and recording several solo albums, he formed the punk rock band The Wesley Willis Fiasco. The band developed a popular underground following as well as attention from musicians such as Eddie Vedder, Henry Rollins, Mike D., Jello Biafra, and the members of White Zombie; and soon caught the attention of Rick Rubin at American Recordings, an independent label distributed by The Warner Group. In early 1994, Willis recorded with the Canadian industrial-metal band Monster Voodoo Machine and appeared on their Juno Award-winning debut album \"Suffersystem\" (RCA Records). In 1995, American Recordings signed Willis as a solo musician; the Wesley Willis Fiasco subsequently broke up in 1996. He went on to record numerous solo albums of novelty rock (two for American Recordings and the remainder for several independent labels or recorded, marketed and released independently by Willis himself), toured frequently, and was profiled on MTV. On September 26, 1996, he was a guest on \"The Howard Stern Show\" where he played nearly identical songs about Baba Booey and Howard Stern. During his many tours and live appearances, Willis became \"famous for greeting fans with a headbutt\"; this left him with a distinctive permanent bruise on his forehead.\n\nIn early 2003 the documentary \"The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll\" was released, chronicling Willis' daily life and interests.\n\nOn August 21, 2003, Willis died due to complications from chronic myelogenous leukemia in Skokie, Illinois.\n\nIn 2013, a supporting character named Milan was introduced for the ongoing Wonder Woman comic. A blind demigod with the power of far-sight and half-brother to Wonder Woman, his physical appearance and mannerisms are based on Wesley Willis.\n\n\"Hellride\" is the term used by Willis to describe his encounters with \"demons\", which occurred mainly on the CTA bus lines in Chicago. According to Willis, his demons were trying to ruin his \"Harmony Joy Music\" or \"Joy Rides\". He uses the term in many of his songs, such as \"I Deserve a Warhellride\".\n\nThe Wesley Willis Fiasco songs were punk rock songs with Willis howling his obscene, absurd rants as lyrics. The band recorded three cover songs: Thin Lizzy's \"Jailbreak\", Pure Prairie League's \"Amie\", and Duran Duran's \"Girls on Film\", the last of which was recorded for a 1997 Duran Duran tribute album. Another song by the Wesley Willis Fiasco, \"The Bar Is Closed\", recreates a section of Rush's \"Tom Sawyer\"; the song \"Casper the Homosexual Friendly Ghost\" does the same with Van Halen's \"Jamie's Cryin'\".\n\nAs a solo artist, Willis filled his albums with funny, bizarre, tense, and often obscene statements about crime, fast food, cultural trends, bus routes, violent confrontations with superheroes, commands for his \"demons\" to engage in bestiality (in \"The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll\", Willis explained that these songs would \"gross out\" the demons enough to leave him alone), and praise for his favorite actors, friends, politicians, and hip hop and rock artists. Songs about rock artists were usually confined to describing a show performed by the band that Willis had attended or opened for, recycling key phrases such as \"The crowd roared like a lion,\" \"A lot of people met the band,\" or \"The band got down like a Magikist\". Many songs end with the phrase \"Rock over London, rock on, Chicago,\" followed by a product slogan, such as \"Wheaties. Breakfast of Champions\" or \"Blockbuster. Wow! What a difference.\"\n\nCritic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that despite Willis' prolific output his songs were essentially variations on the same simple structure, melody and lyrical themes. He also questioned record company motives for releasing albums by Willis: \"It's certainly admirable that Willis has decided to not be tied down by his schizophrenia, but it often seems that his audience is laughing at him, not with him.\" Erlewine also wrote that listening to a Willis record felt \"exploitive\".\n\n"}
