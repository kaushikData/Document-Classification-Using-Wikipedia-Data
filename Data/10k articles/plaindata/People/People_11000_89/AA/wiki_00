The pair have been married since 1958 and have written the music and lyrics for numerous celebrated television shows, films, and stage musicals. The Bergmans have won two Academy Awards for Best Original Song and have been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nAlan Bergman was born to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York, in 1925, and studied at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and earned his master's degree in music at UCLA. Marilyn Bergman was born in 1929, coincidentally at the same Brooklyn hospital where Alan had been born four years earlier, and studied music at The High School of Music & Art in New York before studying psychology and English at New York University. Alan worked as a television director and songwriter at Philadelphia's WCAU-TV in the early 1950s. Johnny Mercer encouraged Alan to move to Los Angeles and become a professional songwriter. Despite the geographical proximity of their upbringing in New York, the Bergmans did not meet until they had both moved to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. Marilyn had moved to California and was friends with songwriter Bob Russell and his wife, Anna, and later described \"drif[ing] into songwriting really by accident because I had a fall and broke my shoulder and couldn't play piano so I started writing lyrics\". Marilyn also felt that she lacked the discipline or talent required to become a concert pianist. The Bergmans had both become collaborators with composer Lew Spence, and only met when Spence suggested they all work together. The Bergmans married in 1958, and have a daughter, Julie Bergman Sender, who works as an independent film producer.\n\nWith Spence the Bergmans wrote the lyrics for the title tracks for Dean Martin's 1958 album \"Sleep Warm\" and Frank Sinatra's 1960 album \"Nice 'n' Easy\". In 1961 the Bergmans wrote their first title song for a motion picture, for \"The Right Approach\", composed by Spence. In 1964 the Bergmans wrote lyrics to their first Broadway musical, \"Something More!\", to music by Sammy Fain.\n\nThe Bergmans wrote lyrics for \"In the Heat of the Night\" with music by Quincy Jones for the 1967 film of the same name, which has been described as their \"breakthrough\". The couple would later work with Jones on Michael Jackson's soundtrack album for \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982), for which they wrote the lyrics for \"Someone In the Dark\", and the 2007 Ennio Morricone tribute album \"We All Love Ennio Morricone\" for which they wrote lyrics to \"I Knew I Loved You\", which was sung by Celine Dion.\n\nThe Bergmans' long relationship with the French composer Michel Legrand began in the late 1960s. The couple wrote English lyrics for Legrand's song \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" featured in \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" (1968), which won them their first Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 41st Academy Awards in 1969. The Bergmans and Legrand were subsequently nominated for the Best Original Song award in the following two years for \"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" from \"The Happy Ending\" (1969) and \"Pieces of Dreams\" from the 1970 film of the same name. The couple's minor work with Legrand in this period included \"Listen to the Sea\" from \"Ice Station Zebra\" (1968) and \"Nobody Knows\" and \"Sweet Gingerbread Man\" from \"The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart\" (1970). Legrand would also feature eight of the Bergman's lyrics on his 1972 album with Sarah Vaughan.\n\nIn 1983 at the 55th Academy Awards, the Bergmans' work on \"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?\" composed by Legrand for the film \"Best Friends\" would be nominated for the Best Original Song award. The 55th Academy Awards was also significant as the Bergmans became the first songwriters ever to have written three of the five nominations for the Academy Award for Best Song, being nominated for \"It Might Be You\" from \"Tootsie\" (composed by Dave Grusin), and \"If We Were in Love\" from \"Yes, Giorgio\" (composed by John Williams), in addition to \"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?\". At the subsequent Academy Awards, their work with Legrand on the 1983 film \"Yentl\" won them the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score or Adaptation Score, with the songs \"Papa, Can You Hear Me?\" and \"The Way He Makes Me Feel\" from the film also being nominated for the Best Original Song award.\n\nThe Bergmans were also co-writers of \"An American Reunion\", the opening ceremony of the inaugural festivities at Washington D.C.'s Lincoln Memorial that marked Bill Clinton's first term as President of the United States in January 1993. In the late 1990s the Bergmans received their most recent nominations for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, for \"Moonlight\" (composed by John Williams) for the 1995 film \"Sabrina\", and \"Love Is Where You Are\" (music by Mark Isham) for the 1999 film \"At First Sight\". 1999 was the same year that the Bergmans received their most recent Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for \"A Time to Dream\"\" (music by Hamisch) for the AFI's \"AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies Special\".\n\nThe Kennedy Center commissioned the Bergmans to write a song cycle in 2001, they chose to collaborate with the composer Cy Coleman. The resulting work, \"Portraits in Jazz: A Gallery of Songs\" was performed on May 17, 2002.\nThe Bergmans wrote the lyrics to Billy Goldenberg's television musical \"Queen of the Stardust Ballroom\" which won the couple their third Primetime Emmy Award Outstanding Achievement in Special Musical Material, it was later the couple's second Broadway show, \"Ballroom\", which opened in 1978.\n\nIn 2007 Alan Bergman released his first album as a vocalist, \"Lyrically, Alan Bergman\", featuring lyrics written by him and his wife and arranged by Alan Broadbent and Jeremy Lubbock. Reviewing the album for Allmusic, John Bush praised Bergman's \"excellent interpretive skills\" and Christopher Loundon in the \"JazzTimes\" described Bergman's voice as a \"...revelation, suggesting both the wise, elder Sinatra and the astutely mellow Fred Astaire, with a touch of the offbeat dreaminess of Chet Baker.\"\n\nThe Bergmans have had a long professional relationship with the singer and actress Barbra Streisand. In addition to their work on the films \"Yentl\" and \"The Way We Were\", in which Streisand starred, the Bergmans wrote Streisand's \"One Voice\" concert which was released as a live album in 1987. Marilyn also served as the executive producer of the \"One Voice\" concert. The Bergmans' song \"Ordinary Miracles\" from Streisand's 1994 concert tour and HBO special won the couple their third Emmy Award, with the couple's script for the tour also being nominated for a CableACE Award. The Bergmans received their fifth Emmy nomination for the song \"On the Way to Becoming Me\" (music by Marvin Hamlisch) from the AFI tribute to Streisand. The Bergmans have also served as board members of Streisand's charitable foundation. Streisand's 2011 album \"What Matters Most\" was recorded in tribute to the Bergmans, and featured ten songs by the couple that she had not previously recorded.\n\nMost recently, The Bergman's collaborated with playwright Josh Ravetch in 2017 on . The play opened to rave reviews as a world premiere at The Geffen Playhouse and was the recipient of the Edgerton New Play Award. The play starred Tyne Daly, Robert Forster and Scott Kradolfer. In the play, there were both classic Bergman songs and new songs written for the play that married in seamlessly with Ravetch's text. The songs became the inner-monologues of the characters in an unusual and touching way. It was one of the best received plays in the history of The Geffen Playhouse.\n\nThe Bergmans have been the recipients of numerous academic honors and lifetime achievement awards. The couple were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1980 and subsequently received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Hall of Fame in 1997. The Bergmans were awarded honorary doctorates by the Berklee College of Music in 1995, they also received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Songwriters that year. In 1996 the couple were the recipients of the inaugural Fiorello Lifetime Achievement Award from New York City's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School. The Bergmans were later inducted into the LaGuardia High School's Hall of Fame. In 1986, Marilyn was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award. Marilyn was later appointed an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture in 1996. In 1998 Marilyn received an Honorary doctorate from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, and in 2011 Alan was presented with a Distinguished Alumnus award from his alma mater, the University of North Carolina. The Bergmans were the recipients of the National Music Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002, Marilyn was also the recipient of the Creative Arts Award from the Kaufman Cultural Center that same year.\n\nThe Bergmans have held several executive positions in organizations connected with the arts. Marilyn served as the president and chairman of the board of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) for fifteen years, from 1994 to 2009. Bergman was elected president and chairman after having served five terms as the since 1984 as the first woman ever to serve on ASCAP's board of directors. Marilyn completed her term as president in April 2009 and has since continued to serve on the board of ASCAP. Marilyn also served two terms as president of CISAC, The International Confederation of Performing Rights Societies. Alan has served on the boards of directors of The Johnny Mercer Foundation, The Artists' Rights Foundation and The Jazz Bakery. The Bergmans have also served on the executive committee of the Music Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and have been board members of the National Academy of Songwriters. Marilyn also served as the president of the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\nThe Bergmans' notable lyrics and compositions include:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28105644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28105644", "title": "Amit Jethwa", "text": "Amit Jethwa\n\nAmit Jethwa (also Amit Jethava) (1975 – 20 July 2010) was an Indian environmentalist and social worker, active in the Gir Forest area near Junagadh, Gujarat. He had filed several court cases against illegal mining in the protected area, naming, Dinu Solanki as one of the respondents. On 20 July 2010 he was shot dead by two assailants on a motorbike. On 6 September, Dinu Solanki's nephew Shiva Solanki has been arrested for allegedly having ordered gun-for-hire Pachan Shiva and one other to commit the killing.\n\nIn Sept 2012, the Gujarat High Court, severely criticized investigations by the Gujarat police who had \"given a clean chit\" to Solanki, despite arresting his nephew; the court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) to take up the case.\n\nIn November 2013, CBI arrested BJP MP Dinu Solanki in connection with having ordered the murder.\n\nAs the president of the Gir Nature Youth Club at Khambha, Amit Jethwa had been active in fighting against encroachment of forests and poaching. He was also instrumental in the five-year jail term of Bollywood actor Salman Khan for shooting an endangered Chinkara deer, a case that concluded after being pursued by activists for eight years. He also highlighted the use of a Chinkara deer in a scene in the movie \"Lagaan\" and opposed a Bhuj court decision which stayed an inquiry against the actor-director Aamir Khan.\n\nHe campaigned vigorously against corruption among officers of the Indian Forest Service, and opposed malafide application of article 356 of the. In 2007, he drew attention to the mysterious deaths of lions in Gir Forest including three that were shot within a few hundred meters of the Babariya forest guard outpost. Claiming that \"Such a thing cannot be possible without support of some forest officials\", Jethwa sought the suspension of an IFS officer. The incident ultimately led to the uncovering of a large lion poaching gang. He later campaigned against shifting of lions to the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh. His efforts were often blocked by forest officials by charging him with offenses such as photographing a dead lion and trespassing.\n\nIn 2007, Jethwa contested the state assembly elections, but lost.\n\nIn 2008, Jethwa pursued the Right to Information Act for addressing grievances, and conducted workshops on the procedure to file requests under RTI to prevent corrupt practices and other mal-administration.\n\nIn 2010, Jethwa had filed a PIL petition questioning the state government's \"inaction\" over the appointment of a Lokayukta. The high court directed the government to appoint a Lokayukta. Jethwa had spearheaded the campaign against rising case pendency in the Gujarat Information Commission (GIC) due to lack of commissioners. It was on his petition that the HC directed the state government to complete the appointments within a stipulated time. He again came to the rescue of thousands of RTI users by filing a writ petition in the HC and made the government accept Indian Postal Order (IPO) as one of the modes of payment to deposit fees while filing of RTI applications.\n\nSince 2008, Jethwa had filed six requests under the Right to Information Act, probing the activities of an illegal mining lobby operating in the protected forest area just outside the Gir Forest National Park. At the time, Jethwa was badly beaten up by goons, allegedly from Solanki's party.\n\nIn mid-2010, he filed a Public interest litigation in the Gujarat High Court, citing evidence found, and naming local BJP politician Dinu Solanki and several relatives, for involvement in the illegal mining in the Gir Forest. He sought directives from the court for stopping power supply to all such mining centers.\n\nIn June 2010, a raid was conducted by the police and geology departments, and a number of mining equipment were seized. However, the equipment was subsequently stolen back. Dinu Bhai was issued a show-cause notice for imposing a\npenalty of RS 4.1 million on him.\n\nSince BJP was the ruling party in the state, he appealed that the matter be investigated by an independent ombudsman or Lokayukta, a constitutional position that had been lying vacant in Gujarat since 2003. He had recently moved court to seek a judicial order to the state government to fill this post.\n\nOn 20 July, shortly after the case against Solanki was filed, Jethwa had gone to meet his lawyer near the Gujarat High court in Ahmedabad. As he was leaving the Satyamev complex, two assailants on a motorcycle shot him at close range with a country-made pistol. Despite being injured, he apparently tried to detain the assailants. Though they were able to get away, he was able to grab a kurta (longshirt) worn by one of the murderers; this had a laundry tag leading to Junagadh. A police car was parked outside the court, and two policemen came out on hearing the single gunshot but failed to pursue the criminals, who escaped on foot.\n\nJethwa's family has alleged that he was under constant threat from Dinu Solanki for interfering with the powerful and illegal mining lobby in Saurashtra. At one point Solanki threatened him in front of a large gathering at a meeting in Kodinar, the area Solanki hails from. Jethwa had recently filed an affidavit at the Kodinar police station seeking protection and stating that he would be killed by Solanki. His father recently received a threatening phone call from Dinu Solanki.\n\nA number of civil bodies and NGOs held a vigil in Ahmedabad on 21 July, seeking an independent investigation.\n\nDuring investigations, the police arrested constable Bahadursinh Wadher and then Pachan Silva, who was allegedly one of the hired killers. Later, on 6 September 2010, they arrested Shiva Solanki, nephew of Dinu Solanki, as the main accused in the case. According to police sources,Shiva had asked constable Bahadursinh to get Amit Jethawa eliminated. \"Bahadur then planned the crime and executed it with the help of sharpshooters Shailesh Pandya and Pachan Shiva.\"\n\nDespite the murder occurring within months of Jethwa's case naming Dinu Solanki, and also the arrest of his nephew, investigations by Gujarat Police crime branch had ruled out any role\nfor Solanki himself. In September 2012, the Gujarat High Court heard an appeal in this matter by Amit Jethwa's father, and severely criticised\nthe investigations by the Gujarat Police. The court commented that the investigations had been \"far from fair, independent, bona fide or prompt.\", \nand that Shiva Solanki and Dinu were living in the same joint family, and had very likely had some interactions.\n\nIn November 2013, Dinu Solanki was arrested by the CBI.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "406360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=406360", "title": "Bedivere", "text": "Bedivere\n\nIn the Matter of Britain, Sir Bedivere ( or ; ; , also spelt Bedevere) is the Knight of the Round Table of King Arthur who returns Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. He serves as Arthur's marshal and is frequently associated with Sir Kay. Sir Lucan is his brother and Sir Griflet is his cousin.\n\nBedivere is one of the earliest characters to be associated with the Matter of Britain, appearing in a number of early Welsh texts in which he is named as Bedwyr Bedrydant (\"Bedwyr of the Perfect Sinews\"), a handsome, one-handed knight under Arthur's command. His father is given as Pedrawd or Bedrawd, and his children as Amhren and Eneuawg, both members of Arthur's court.\n\nOne of the earliest direct references to Bedwyr can be found in the 10th-century poem \"Pa Gur\" which recounts the exploits of a number of Arthur's knights, including Bedwyr, Cei and Manawydan. Of Bedwyr, the narrative says:\n\nA 9th-century version of \"Englynion y Beddau\" (\"The Stanzas of the Graves\") gives Bedwyr's final resting place on Tryfan. In the c.110 hagiography of Cadoc, Bedwyr is alongside Arthur and Cei (Kay) in dealing with King Gwynllyw of Gwynllwg's abduction of Gwladys from her father's court in Brycheiniog. A possible allusion to Bedwyr could be found in the reference to \"Bedwyr's well\" in the 9th-century \"Marwnad Cadwallon ap Cadfan\". The Welsh Triads name Bedwyr as \"Battle-Diademed\", and a superior to Drystan, Hueil mab Caw and even Cei. A catchphrase often quipped by Cei, \"by the hand of my friend\" is likely a reference to Bedwyr's disability.\n\nBedwyr is a prominent character in the tale of \"Culhwch and Olwen\", in which he appears at the head of Arthur's court list with his friend Cei and is described as the handsomest man in the world (save for Arthur and Drych fab Cibddar), and the wielder of a magic lance. He is called upon to accompany Culhwch on his quest to win Olwen's hand in marriage, and is the first knight to strike the giant Ysbaddaden with the poisoned spear meant for Culhwch. He goes on to assist Culhwch in completing the impossible tasks given to him by Ysbaddaden; he helps Cei and Goreu fab Custennin kill Wrnach the Giant, rescues Mabon ap Modron from his imprisonment, retrieves the hairs of Dillus the Bearded, captures the cauldron of Diwrnach during Arthur's attack on Ireland and takes part in the hunting of Twrch Trwyth with Arthur's dog Cavall at his side. The tale ends with the completion of the tasks, the humiliation and murder of Ysbaddaden, and the marriage of Culhwch and Olwen.\n\nHe is one of Arthur's loyal allies in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", and maintains this position in much later Arthurian literature. He helps Arthur and Kay fight the Giant of Mont Saint-Michel, and joins Arthur in his war against Emperor Lucius of Rome.\n\nIn several English versions of Arthur's death, including Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", the \"Alliterative Morte Arthure\" and the \"Stanzaic Morte Arthur\", Bedivere and Arthur are among the few survivors of the Battle of Camlann. After the battle, at the request of the mortally wounded king, Bedivere throws Excalibur back to the Lady of the Lake. However, he does this only after twice thinking the sword too valuable to Britain to throw into the water. When he reports that nothing in particular happened, King Arthur admonishes him, for Arthur knows that the mystical sword would create some supernatural event. Finally, Sir Bedivere casts the sword into the water, at which a hand arises and catches the sword mid-air, then sinks into the waters. Arthur is thus assured that the sword has been returned.\n\nUpon the death of Arthur, Bedivere enters a hermitage, where he spends the remainder of his life (the same hermitage, led by the Mordred-ousted Bishop of Canterbury, that Lancelot and some of his kindred knights will resort to in their own penitence). It is implied that both King Arthur and Queen Guinevere lie beside each other in or near this hermitage.\n\nBedivere is depicted by modern authors such as Rosemary Sutcliff, Gillian Bradshaw, John M. Ford and Mary Stewart, where he is given Lancelot's traditional role as Guinevere's lover, Lancelot having been added to the cycle too late to seem historical. \n\n\n"}

He killed James Hickey in a confrontation in a saloon, but it was ruled self-defense. He was present at the beginning of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, but was unarmed and ran from the shootout. Only a year later, while drunk, he confronted gunfighter \"Buckskin\" Frank Leslie and was killed.\n\nWilliam Floyd Claiborne was born in Yazoo County, Mississippi. As a young man he worked as a cowhand and remuda rider for John Slaughter and helped him drive cattle from Texas to the Arizona Territory in 1879. In Tombstone, he worked on the amalgamator at mines in Charleston, and as a slag cart driver at the Neptune Mining Company smelter in Hereford, Arizona.\n\nOn October 1, 1881, Claiborne got into an argument with James Hickey in the Queen's Saloon in Charleston. Hickey had been drinking for three days. Harry Queen, the saloon owner and eyewitness reported on the event:\n\nClaiborne shot Hickey in the cheek below his left eye, killing him instantly. Over a month later, on November 26, the trial was convened, but only four jurors showed up. The next court day, three jurors did not show up. When all of the jurors finally showed up, they asked the judge if they could convict on second degree murder. When the judge said no, they said they could not agree on a verdict and the judge declared a mistrial. A second trial was set for May 11, 1882, but most of the defense attorneys did not appear. A new trial date was set on May 15 but not enough jurors could be found. Hickey was not well-liked and when a jury was finally convened, Billy was found not guilty and set free.\n\nIn 1881, after William \"Billy the Kid\" Bonney was killed, Claiborne demanded that others call him \"Billy the Kid\". He reportedly killed one to three men who refused. Claiborne was a heavy drinker and hothead. He became friends with Ike and Billy Clanton, and with Tom and Frank McLaury.\n\nOn the morning of October 26, Ike Clanton was carrying his rifle and revolver in violation of a city ordinance. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street and Virgil buffaloed him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace. Wallace wasn't in the courthouse, and Wyatt waited with Clanton while Virgil went to find Judge Wallace.\n\nWyatt spotted Tom McLaury outside the courthouse and thought he was armed. Wyatt confronted McLaury, demanding to know, \"Are you heeled or not?\", but McLaury denied it. Wyatt later testified that he saw a revolver in plain sight on the right hip of Tom's pants. As an unpaid deputy town marshal, assisting his brother and Town Marshal Virgil Earp, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol in his waistband, as was the custom of that time. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his coat pocket and buffaloed Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street.\n\nAt around 1:30–2:00 pm, Ike's 19-year-old younger brother Billy Clanton and Tom's older brother Frank McLaury arrived in town. They stopped at the saloon in the Grand Hotel on Allen Street. Claiborne told them about their brothers' beatings at the hands of the Earp brothers within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated a lot of talk in town. Angrily, Frank said he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom and Ike. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed.\n\nFrank and Billy found Ike and Tom. They went to Spangenberg's gun shop, where Frank and Billy purchased ammunition. Ike wanted to buy a gun, but seeing the bandage on Ike's head, the proprietor refused. The McLaurys left to collect some money due them for cattle they had sold. Claiborne and Billy Clanton went to get Clanton's horse. They met the others a few minutes later at the O.K. Corral. Witnesses overheard them threatening the Earps.\n\nVirgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street, were threatening the Earps, and were armed. He decided he had to act. Meanwhile, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, a friend to the Cowboys, had heard of the trouble and he immediately went looking for the Cowboys.\n\nIn Hafford's Saloon, Behan found City Marshal Virgil Earp, who asked Behan to help him disarm the Cowboys. Instead, Behan offered to talk to the Clantons and McLaurys on his own to see if they would give up their arms. Behan left and Virgil waited several minutes when local furniture dealer John Fonck told Virgil that the Cowboys were on Fremont St. Virgil said he did not want to interfere if they were on their way out of town, but if they were armed while in town he would have to arrest them. Fonck responded, \"Why, they're all down on Fremont Street now.\"\n\nAt about 2:30 pm the Earps and Holliday found Frank and Tom McLaury and Ike and Billy Clanton gathered near the front of an empty lot off Fremont street, next to C.S. Fly's Boarding House and Photography Studio. Behan said he attempted to persuade Frank McLaury to give up his weapons, but Frank insisted that he would only give up his guns after City Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers were disarmed.\n\nThe Earps and Holliday walked north on Fourth Street and then west, down the south side west of Fremont Street, looking for the Cowboys. They passed the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral and then Bauer's butcher shop.\n\nSheriff Behan saw the Earps and Holliday approaching. He left the Cowboys and went to the lawmen, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified later that Behan told them, \"For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!\" Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, \"I have disarmed them.\" Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd gone down to the Cowboys \"for the purpose of disarming them,\" not that he'd actually disarmed them.\n\nWyatt testified afterward that he saw \"Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, and Billy Clanton standing in a row against the east side of the building on the opposite side of the vacant space west of Fly's photograph gallery. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne and a man I don't know <nowiki>[</nowiki>Wes Fuller<nowiki>]</nowiki> were standing in the vacant space about halfway between the photograph gallery and the next building west.\" Wes Fuller was towards the back of the lot.\n\nWhen the shooting commenced—nobody could be certain who fired first—Ike Clanton ran towards Wyatt and pleaded that he was unarmed and did not want a fight. To this Wyatt said he responded, \"Go to fighting or get away!\" Clanton ran through the front door of Fly's boarding house and escaped. Billy Claiborne ran out the back of the lot.\n\nWhen the Rev. Endicott Peabody announced he would preach a sermon in Charleston in early February, 1882, against alcoholism, Claiborne wrote warning him to stay away from the subject. Peabody replied that he would preach on any subject he chose at any time and heard no more from the bullying Claiborne.\n\nAfter running from the O.K. Corral shoot out, Claiborne's reputation fell. He testified at the O.K. Corral Spicer hearing, and then left Tombstone for several months. He went to Globe and got a job in the mines. He told a friend that he was \"working double shifts to get enough money to go to Tombstone and kill Frank Leslie.\" Billy blamed Leslie for killing his friend Johnny Ringo. Bill return to Tombstone on November 14, 1882.\n\n\"Buckskin\" Frank Leslie was tending bar at the Oriental Saloon on November 14, 1882 when Claiborne, who was very drunk, began using insulting and abusive language. Leslie asked Claiborne to leave, but Claiborne continued his foul and abusive speech. Leslie later testified,\n\nWithin a few minutes, two men told Leslie there was a man waiting outside to shoot him. When Leslie stepped outside, he saw \"a foot of rifle barrel protruding from the end of the fruit stand.\" He told Claiborne \"Don't shoot, I don't want you to kill me, nor do I want to have to shoot you.\" but Claiborne, still drunk, raised his rifle and fired the weapon, missing Leslie. Leslie returned fire and hit Claiborne in the chest. \"I saw him double up and had my pistol cocked and aimed at him again ... I advanced upon him, but did not shoot, when he said, 'Don't shoot again, I am killed.' Claiborne was taken to a doctor by friends, where he died six hours after being shot. His last words were reportedly, \"Frank Leslie killed Johnny Ringo, I saw him do it\". He was buried in Tombstone's Boothill Cemetery.\n\nLeslie was found to have acted in self-defense and was not charged.\n\n"}

His career of over twenty-five years has been characterised by numerous successes on the Irish charts as well as recurring problems with drug addiction and recovery.\n\nBorn at Holles Street Hospital in Dublin on 23 May 1960, Dignam grew up in the North Dublin suburb of Finglas. He studied the classical art of bel canto singing with teacher Frank Merriman at the Bel Canto House School of Singing in Dublin. At the age of six, he was raped by a neighbour. This continued to occur over a three-year period until, at the age of nine, Dignam sought help from his best friend's brother, a man in his twenties. During the meeting with his best friend's brother, Dignam explained his situation and he was then raped by this man as well. Dignam later suggested his drug addiction may have resulted from the psychological trauma caused by these events.\n\nDignam formed an early version of Aslan called Meelah XVIII. Meelah XVIII created a recording for \"The Dave Fanning Show\" on 2FM in 1980. The Meelah XVIII songs \"Toy Soldier\" and \"Meelah Pt. 2\" were included on the Aslan triple CD, The \"Rarities\" disc from \"The Platinum Collection\". Meelah XVIII musicians were Christy Dignam, Tony Talbot, Mick McKenna, Joe Jewell, and Gerry Conlon.\n\nAs Aslan singles \"This Is\", \"Please Don't Stop\", \"Loving Me Lately\", \"Pretty Thing\" and \"Feel No Shame\" became popular, Dignam's relationship with his bandmates was becoming strained due to his problems with heroin addiction. On Wednesday 7 September 1988, \"The Star\" newspaper ran with the headline \"ASLAN: IT'S THE END\", informing the public of Dignam's separation from Aslan. The remaining members of the band continued as Aslan for some time (with a new lead singer, Eamon Doyle) before the band eventually split. Dignam went solo with guitarist Conor Goff, forming Dignam & Goff.\n\nHowever, on 11 July 1993 Aslan reformed, for what was supposed to be a \"once off gig\" in Finglas. With a reignited spark and new material, Aslan continued to become one of Ireland's most successful and hard-working bands. Their studio albums include \"Feel No Shame\", \"Goodbye Charlie Moonhead\", \"Here Comes Lucy Jones\" and \"Waiting for the Madness To End\". They have had two \"best of\" albums: \"Shame About Lucy Moonhead\" and the triple album \"The Platinum Collection\". They have also had a best-selling live album \"Made In Dublin\" and an official bootleg album (available at gigs) called \"Aslan Live At The Olympia\" which features appearances from Jerry Fish, Relish and Damien Rice.\n\nDignam lists Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, T-Rex, Bon Jovi, Phil Lynott, The Rolling Stones, and John Lennon as his musical influences. He has also been listed as influencing groups like Damien Dempsey, Jerry Fish, Damien Rice, George Murphy, Rob Smith, Alabama 3, and more.\n\nDignam has been married for more than 20 years to his wife Kathryn, and has a daughter, Kiera, who is also a singer. He has two grandsons, Cian & Jake and a granddaughter, Ava.\n\nDignam turned to heroin in the 1980s, and his involvement with the drug caused conflicts which led to his eventual departure from Aslan.\n\nHe entered multiple drug treatment programs, including a stint in a rehab program in a Buddhist monastery, Wat Tham Krabok, in Thailand in 2004. This was featured in the documentary \"Heroin: Facing The Dragon\".\n\nDignam recounted his story of drug addiction in his autobiography, \"This is Christy Dignam\", co-written by journalist Neil Fetherstonhaugh and published by Merlin Publishing. One reviewer said it \"should be required reading for anyone hovering on the edges of the drug culture.\"\n\nIn September 2010, Dignam was admitted to hospital for tests.\n\nDignam was initially admitted to hospital with a suspected chest infection; this progressed to pneumonia. After numerous tests were carried out in March 2013, he was diagnosed with amyloidosis. Upon returning to consciousness Dignam spoke of having had a near-death experience that prompted doctors to inject him with two shots of adrenaline. Dignam said, \"There was a blockage in my arm where the adrenaline was going in so they had to slit the side of my neck, straight into the jugular and right down into my heart. I felt like I had died for a minute or so, nothing seemed to matter, then suddenly the adrenaline restarted my heart.\" He underwent chemotherapy for the condition, and as of September 2017, continues to receive chemotherapy.\n\n"}

{"id": "848028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=848028", "title": "Doctor Mabuse", "text": "Doctor Mabuse\n\nDoctor Mabuse is a fictional character created by Norbert Jacques in the novel \"Dr. Mabuse der Spieler\" and made famous by the three movies director Fritz Lang made about the character; see \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\". Although the character was designed deliberately to mimic villains such as Dr. Fu Manchu, Doctor Nikola, Fantômas, or Svengali, the latter of which was a direct inspiration, Jacques' goals were commercial success and to make political comments, in much the same way that the silent movie \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920) had done just a few years previously.\n\nDr. Mabuse is a master of disguise and telepathic hypnosis known to employ body transference, most often through demonic possession but sometimes utilizing object technologies such as television or phonograph machines, to build a \"society of crime\". Mabuse rarely commits his crimes in person, instead operating primarily through a network of agents enacting his schemes. Mabuse's agents range from career criminals working for him, to innocents blackmailed or hypnotized into cooperation, to dupes manipulated so successfully that they do not realize that they are doing exactly what Mabuse planned for them to do.\n\nMabuse's identity often changes; one \"Dr. Mabuse\" may be defeated and sent to an asylum, jail or the grave, only for a new \"Dr. Mabuse\" to later appear, as depicted in \"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\". The replacement invariably has the same methods, the same powers of hypnosis and the same criminal genius. There are even suggestions in some instalments of the series, that the \"real\" Mabuse is some sort of spirit that possesses a series of hosts.\n\nHe first appeared in the 1921 novel \"Dr. Mabuse der Spieler\" (\"Dr. Mabuse The Gambler\") by Norbert Jacques. The novel benefitted from unprecedented publicity and quickly became a best-seller. Lang, already an accomplished director, worked with his wife Thea von Harbou on a revision of the novel to bring it to the screen, where it also became a great success. The film \"Dr. Mabuse der Spieler\" (1922), with a playing time of more than four hours, was released in two sections: \"The Great Gambler: An Image of the Time\" and \"Inferno: A Game for the People of our Age.\"\n\nAfter the great successes of the novel and the movie, it was almost a decade before anything more was done with the character. Jacques had been working on a sequel to the novel, named \"Mabuse's Colony\", in which Mabuse has died and a group of his devotees are starting an island colony, based on the principles described by Mabuse's manifesto. However, the novel was unfinished. After conversations with Lang and von Harbou, Jacques agreed to discontinue the novel and the sequel instead became the 1933 movie \"Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse\", in which the Mabuse of 1920 (still played by Rudolf Klein-Rogge) is an inmate in an insane asylum but has for some time been obsessively writing meticulous plans for crime and terrorism—plans that are being performed by a gang of criminals outside the asylum, who receive their orders from a person who has identified himself to them only as Dr. Mabuse.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5192308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5192308", "title": "Ethnic groups of Argentina", "text": "Ethnic groups of Argentina\n\nThe ethnography of Argentina makes this country, along with other areas of relatively modern settlement like Canada, Brazil, Australia or New Zealand, a \"crisol de razas\" (race crucible), or a melting pot of different peoples. In fact, immigration to Argentina was so strong that it eventually became the country with the second highest number of immigrants, with 6.6 million, second only to the United States with 27 million, and ahead of such other immigratory receptors such as Canada, Brazil and Australia.\n\nUpon the independence of Argentina, the newborn country had a large territory but was thinly populated, and its ethnic composition was largely the same from the colonial era that had lasted from 16th to early 19th centuries. In the mid-19th century, a large wave of immigration started to arrive due to newly established Constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and due to issues in the Old World such as wars, poverty, hunger, social unrest and pursuit for opportunities or a better life in the New World. This immigration was mostly from Europe but also from the Arab world, Russia and Japan.\n\nThus, most Argentines are descendants of these 19th and 20th century immigrants, with about 97% of the population being of European or partial European descent and mestizo. Arab descent is also significant (mostly of Syrian and Lebanese origin) and the Jewish population is the biggest in all Latin America (7th in the world). Mestizo population in Argentina, unlike in other Latin American countries, is very low, as is the Black population after being decimated by diseases and wars in the 19th century, though since the 1990s a new wave of Black immigration has been arriving. Native Argentines on the other hand have significant populations in the country's North-West (Quechua, Diaguita, Kolla, Aymara); in the North-East (Guaraní, Mocoví, Toba, Wichí); and in the Patagonia or South (Mapuche, Tehuelche). Asian peoples have increasing minorities in some Buenos Aires neighborhoods and are expanding to other large Argentine cities. Through the centuries people from neighboring countries like Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru have also immigrated to Argentina and established important communities.\n\nThe number and composition of the population was stable until 1853, when the national government, after passing a constitution, started a campaign to attract European immigration to populate the country. This state policy lasted several decades. At first the number of immigrants was modest compared to other countries such as the United States (though the number of immigrants was steadily increasing as they moved to the rural areas to settle and to found \"colonias\" like those of Italian, German, Swiss, or French origin), but in the 1870s, due to the economic crisis in Europe, it started to increase, reaching an extremely high rate between 1890 and 1930. Unofficial records show that, during the 1860s, 160,000 immigrants arrived in Argentina, while in the 1880s the net number increased to 841,000, almost doubling the population of the country in that decade.\n\nBetween 1857 and 1950, 6,611,000 European immigrants arrived in Argentina, making it the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, only second to the United States with 27 million, and ahead of such other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay and permanently changing the ethnography of Argentina.\n\nImmigrants arrived through the port of Buenos Aires and many stayed in the capital or within Buenos Aires Province and this still happens today. In 1895, immigrants accounted for 52% of the population in the capital, and 31% in the province of Buenos Aires (some provinces of the littoral, such as Santa Fe, had about 40%, and the Patagonian provinces had about 50%).\n\nWaves of immigrants from European countries arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Over 30 percent of the country's population was born overseas by 1914, and half of the population in Buenos Aires and Rosario was foreign-born. Over 80% of the Argentine population, per the 1914 Census, were immigrants, their children or grandchildren.\n\nThe Hotel de Inmigrantes, built in 1906 to accommodate the 100,000 to 200,000 yearly arrivals at the Port of Buenos Aires, was made a National Historic Monument.\n\nItalian immigration to Argentina began in the 19th century, just after Argentina won its independence from Spain. \nArgentine culture has significant connections to Italian culture, in terms of language, customs and traditions.\n\nItalians became firmly established throughout Argentina, with the greatest concentrations in the city of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires Province, Santa Fe Province, Entre Ríos Province, Córdoba Province, Tucumán Province, La Pampa Province, and the nearby country of Uruguay.\n\nThere are many reasons for the Italian immigration to Argentina: Italy was enduring economic problems caused mainly by the unification of the Italian states into one nation. The country was impoverished, unemployment was rampant, certain areas were overpopulated, and Italy was subject to significant political turmoil. Italians saw in Argentina a chance to build for themselves a brand new life.\n\nThe Italian population in Argentina is the second largest in the world, by numbers, outside of Italy, some 25 million people. Italians form a majority of the population of Argentina and neighbouring Uruguay as up to two-third have some Italian background; among the Latin American countries, only Brazil has more people of Italian descent (28 million, approximately 15 percent of Brazil's total population).\n\nGerman immigration to Argentina occurred during five main time periods: pre–1870, 1870–1914, 1918–1933, 1933–1940 and post–1945.\n\nArgentina and Germany have long had close ties to each other. A flourishing trade developed between them as early as the German Unification, and Germany had a privileged position in the Argentine economy. Later, Argentina maintained a strong economic relationship with both Germany and Great Britain and supported them with supplies during World War I.\n\nThere are around 50,000 German descendants living in Buenos Aires. After the United States and Brazil, Argentina is among the nations with the largest number of German descendants in the world, together with Australia, Canada, South Africa and France. They arrived in the 19th century and then before and after World War II. Their arrival continued over an extended period, from the middle to end of the 19th century, until 1960 of the 20th century. Germans, Swiss, Belgian, Luxembourg and French people founded the Colony of Esperanza, establishing the first agricultural colony and then founding others.\n\nGermans are one of the largest ethnic groups of Argentina and have had one of the biggest impacts in the Argentine culture. The influence of their culture has also impacted Argentinian cuisine; this trend is especially apparent in the field of desserts. The pastries known as facturas are Germanic in origin: croissants, known as medialunas (\"half-moons\", from German \"Halbmond\"), are the most popular of these, and can be found in two varieties: butter- and lard-based. Also German in origin are the \"Berliner\" known as bolas de Fraile (\"friar's balls\"), and the rolls called piononos.\n\nThe facturas were re-christened with local names given the difficult phonology of German, and usually Argentinized by the addition of a dulce de leche filling. That was also the case with the \"Kreppel\", called torta fritas in Argentina, which were introduced by German immigrants, and similarly with the \"Achtzig Schlag\" cake, translated as torta ochenta golpes. In addition, dishes like chucrut (sauerkraut) and many different kinds of sausage like bratwurst have made it into mainstream Argentine cuisine.\n\nFrench immigration has left a significant mark on Argentina, with a notable influence on the arts, culture, science and society of the country. Many emblematic buildings in cities like Buenos Aires, Rosario, and Córdoba were built following French Beaux Arts and neoclassical styles, such as the Argentine National Congress, the Metropolitan Cathedral, or the Central Bank building. In particular, landscape architect Carlos Thays, in his position as 1891 Director of Parks and Walkways, is largely responsible for planting thousands of trees, creating the Buenos Aires Botanical Garden and giving the city many of its parks and plazas that are sometimes compared to similar designs in Paris.\n\nWhile Argentines of French descent make up a substantial percent of the Argentine population, they are less visible than other similarly-sized ethnic groups. This is due to the high degree of assimilation and the lack of substantial French colonies throughout the country.\n\nArgentine elites diminished the Spanish culture from their culture in the newly independent country and created Argentine culture.\n\nBetween 1857 and 1940 more than 2 million Spanish people emigrated to Argentina, mostly from Galicia, Basque Country, Asturias, Cantabria in northern Spain, Catalonia in northeast Spain, and also from Andalusia in southern Spain.\n\nScandinavians arrived in Argentina around 1909. The first ones settled in the northeastern area and founded a city called Villa Svea (now called Oberá). It was composed of Swedes, Norwegians and Finns. Russians, Germans, English and Danish joined them before and after World War I and spread throughout the country.\n\nAustrians settled throughout the country in the late 19th century.\n\nApproximately 44,000 Swiss emigrated to Argentina until 1940, and settled mainly in the provinces of Córdoba and Santa Fe and, to a lesser extent, in Buenos Aires.\n\nAround 100,000 British immigrants arrived between 1857 and 1940. The British community founded solid institutions like the British Hospital in Buenos Aires, the \"Herald\" newspaper, prestigious bilingual schools and clubs as the Lawn Tennis Club and Hurlingham Club. British immigrants had a strong impact on the taste of Argentine sports through the development of football, polo, hockey, and rugby, among others.\n\nToday, there are over 350,000 Argentinians with ancestry from the British Isles.\n\nThe Armenians came in different time periods. The first wave was in the late 19th century, as a result of the Adana massacres and such targeted at Armenians in the region of Cilicia. The second (and largest) wave was from the 1910s to the 1930s, originated solely by the Armenian Genocide. Armenophobia rose again in Turkey in the mid-20th century, and created the final migration of Armenians to the world – some of them arrived in Argentina and formed a separate third wave. The last wave was a result of the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nThere are around 100,000 Armenians in Argentina, most of them in the Palermo neighborhood, Buenos Aires.\n\nBulgarian immigration in Argentina began intensively in the 1920s and had a second boom period between 1937 and 1938. Most of them were farmers from the northern regions of Bulgaria. Most settled in the province of Chaco.\n\nThe Czechs were also part of the great immigration of the early 20th century. Most of their descendants live in the provinces of Chaco and Mendoza, in the country.\n\nThe Irish emigrated to Argentina in the 19th century, between 1830 and 1875. They extended throughout the country, especially in the provinces of Santa Fe, Entre Rios and Córdoba. The modern Irish-Argentine community is estimated at 500,000-1,000,000. Argentina is the home of the fifth largest Irish community in the world.\n\nThe Lithuanians arrived mostly after the First World War, between 1925 and 1930, and settled mainly in Buenos Aires, Berisso and Rosario.\n\nFrom 1888 to 1890, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was literally overwhelmed by a transatlantic migration wave, the so-called \"Argentinienfieber\" - an expression which could be translated into English by \"the Argentine fever symptom\". In less than two years, more than one thousand Luxembourgers - representing 0.5 per cent of the entire population - decided to emigrate to Argentina.\n\nThe first organized immigration from the Netherlands occurred in 1889, when immigrants came from the area of Friesland. A second immigration took place around 1924. Most of them settled in Mar del Plata, Bahía Blanca, Comodoro Rivadavia, and Chubut.\n\nOrganized Polish immigration began in 1897 and had a decisive influence in the Argentine population. Between the two world wars (1918–1939) large numbers of Poles emigrated. They mostly settled in Llavallol, San Justo, Valentín Alsina, San Martin, and Quilmes. Between 1946 and 1950 around one hundred thousand Poles settled in the country.\n\nThere is a significant number of Russians in Argentina. Most reside in Buenos Aires and northeastern areas. The majority of them arrived between 1880 and 1921. Another small wave arrived in the country in early 1990.\n\nUkrainian regular immigration to Argentina began in the 19th century. The first Ukrainian settlement in the country was in 1897. Subsequently, groups of immigrants settled in Buenos Aires, Misiones, Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa, Mendoza, Río Negro, and Entre Ríos. Although the Argentine census does not provide data on ethnic origins, estimates of the Ukrainian population range from 305,000 to 500,000 people (the latter figure making Ukrainians up to 1% of the total Argentine population).\n\nThe Welsh settlement in Argentina – known in Welsh as \"Y Wladfa\" – began in 1865 and occurred mainly along the coast of Chubut Province in the far southern region of Patagonia. In the 19th and early 20th century the Argentine government encouraged the immigration of Europeans to populate the country outside the Buenos Aires region; between 1856 and 1875 no fewer than 34 settlements of immigrants of various nationalities were established between Santa Fe and Entre Ríos. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe by 44 Welsh people who left Chubut, and another group settled at Coronel Suárez in southern Buenos Aires Province. In the early 21st century, around 50,000 Patagonians are of Welsh descent. The Welsh-Argentine community is centered around Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin. By Chubut's own estimate, the number of Welsh speakers is about 25,000.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Argentina's Jewish community derives from immigrants of Northern, Central, and Eastern European origin (Ashkenazi Jews). Argentina's Jewish population is, by far, the largest in all of Latin America and is the fifth largest in the world. Buenos Aires itself is said to have over 100,000 practicing Jews, making it one of the largest Jewish urban centers in the world (see also History of the Jews in Argentina).\n\nThere are 1,300,000–3,500,000 Argentines whose ancestry traces back to any of various waves of immigrants, largely of levantine cultural and linguistic heritage and/or identity.\n\nMost Levantine Argentines are from either Lebanese or Syrian background, originating mainly from what is now Lebanon and Syria. There are people from other Arabic speaking countries in lesser numbers. Most are Christians of the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic (Maronite) Churches. The first Levantines settled in Argentina in the 19th century, and most who came during this time period were Sirio-Lebanese. From 1891 to 1920, 367,348 people of Levantines heritage immigrated into Argentina. When they were first processed in the ports of Argentina, they were classified as Turks because modern-day Lebanon and Syria were then occupied by the Turkish Ottoman Empire.\n\nThere are Amerindian groups like the Tobas, Aymaras, Guaraníes and Mapuches, among others, who still maintain their cultural roots, but are under continuous pressure for religious and idiomatic integration.\n\nThe local natives who speak Quechua adopted that language either after they were conquered by the Inca Empire (that reached Tucumán) or by the teachings of the Spanish religious missionaries who came from Peru to today's Santiago del Estero Province; the language is quickly losing importance. The Survey on Indigenous Populations, published by the National Institute for Statistics and Census, gives a total of 600,329 people who see themselves as descending from or belonging to an indigenous people, representing 1.5% of Argentina's population.\n\nAccording to a recent study of 246 individuals, up to 30% of this population could have varying degrees of Native American ancestry.\n\nThe black population in Argentina declined since the middle 19th century from 15% of the total population in 1857 (Blacks and Mulatto people), to 1% at present (mainly mulattoes and immigrants from Cape Verde).\n\nAfro-Argentines were up to a third of the population during colonial times, most of them slaves brought from Africa to work for the criollos. The 1813 Assembly abolished slavery and led to the Freedom of Wombs Law of 1813, which automatically freed slaves' children at birth. During the wars of independence (1810–21) and the War of the Triple Alliance (1865–70), the male cohort within this ethnic group was reduced when thousands of black citizens were forcefully recruited and used as front-line soldiers.\n\nThe first Asian-Argentines were of Japanese descent, arriving in the 1900s. For most of the 20th century they were the only Asians in Argentina. Japanese immigrants were primarily from the island of Okinawa; the majority of dry cleaning establishments in Buenos Aires were, by the mid-20th century, Japanese businesses. During the 1970s the main Asian influx was from China, and during the 1990s from South Korea and Laos. Unlike most immigrants who arrived earlier in the century, they tended to remain in close social circles and not mix with other local ethnicities. This excluded the Japanese who were the first to arrive and therefore the first to produce a native generation of mixed race Japanese-Argentines, thus integrating more so than the other Asian groups.\n\nThe Japanese-Argentine population assimilated well into Argentine society, and nearly 78% of the fourth generation of Japanese-Argentines (Yonsei) are of mixed European and Japanese descent, mostly intermixed with immigrants from Italy and Spain, and in lesser number from the United Kingdom, France (mainly Occitania), Germany and Switzerland. The use of Japanese language has declined in Argentina and the Japanese-Argentine citizens speak the nation's national language, Spanish, although a minority of them only speak Japanese when living with a Japanese-born relative at home, but when they are living with Argentine-born relatives they only speak Spanish.\n\nIntermarriage in the Japanese-Argentine community. Proportion of mixed-race in each generation (%):\n\n\nAmong the most numerous immigrants from neighbouring countries are Paraguayans (the biggest foreign community), Bolivians, Peruvians, and in lesser number Ecuadorians and Brazilians.\nThere have been reports of discrimination to these groups, as well as exploitation; Buenos Aires Police have released Bolivian citizens working in textile factories, some run by South Korean immigrants.\n\nUruguayans represent a special case; many have crossed the Río de la Plata to live in Argentina, mainly in Buenos Aires, searching for opportunities in the bigger country. Given their cultural resemblances with the porteños, they are rarely discriminated against.\n\n\n\n"}

Later, he taught singing for 42 years at the Royal College of Music.\n\nBorn in Lichfield, the son of Thomas and Mary King, Frederic King was baptised on 13 January 1853 at St Michael's church in Lichfield. He worked in an auction house before joining the concert agents Messrs Harrison. He made his professional debut in a ballad concert at St James's Hall in 1878 and launched a successful career as a platform singer in baritone roles. He married Eva Hume (born 1863) in London in 1882, and they had two children, Mary Eva Oakley King (1883–1955) and Ernest Archibald Frederic King (1888–1973).\n\nKing created the role of Callias, the Priest of Apollo, in the first performance of Arthur Sullivan's oratorio \"The Martyr of Antioch\" at the triennial Leeds Festivals in 1880. He sang the role of Mephistopheles in the English premiere of Berlioz's \"La damnation de Faust\" at the Royal Albert Hall in 1882. In 1886, at Leeds, he sang the role of Lucifer in the first performance of Sullivan's cantata \"The Golden Legend\" (1886).\n\nReviewing King's performance in the latter work, Herman Klein, in \"Musical Notes\", called him:\n\n...a talented and conscientious artist, who invested his music with all the dramatic significance and sardonic humour of which it was susceptible. Truth to tell, there is not much diabolical in Longfellow's fiend, and it would seem as though Sir Arthur Sullivan had sought on occasion to atone for his comparative mildness by applying a background of orchestration worthy in its sonority of Berlioz or Wagner. Whether Satan could make himself heard in Pandemonium may be an open question, but undoubtedly there are moments in \"The Golden Legend\" when Lucifer's human representative, be his voice ever so stentorian, is bound to be inaudible. All that artistic singing could do to lend the character its proper prominence was done by Mr. King.\nOn retiring from the concert platform King taught singing at the Royal College of Music for 42 years, from 1889 to 1931. Among his students were Norman Allin, Miriam Licette, Robert Radford, David Brazell, William Samuell and Herbert Heyner. After his retirement from the Royal Academy of Music he continued to give lessons privately, the last being just before he was taken ill a week before his death.\n\nKing died in May 1933 aged 80 at his home in Hampstead after a short illness. His funeral service took place at Golders Green Crematorium on 22 May 1933. He was survived by his widow, Eva King, and his children, Mrs Mary Eva Oakley Turier and Ernest Archibald Frederic King. In his will he left them £1,375.\n"}

He is thus far the youngest person elected sheriff in Louisiana.\n\nOurso was the youngest of eleven children born to a Cajun couple, Rudolph and Ida Ourso of Plaquemine, Louisiana, the Iberville parish seat. He was a boxer at Plaquemine Senior High School, as were his friends and later political allies, state representative and then Lieutenant Governor Robert \"Bobby\" Freeman, school superintendent Sam Distefano, and District Attorney Sam Cashio. After high school graduation, Ourso served in the United States Army from 1952 to 1954, including fifteen months in combat in the Korean War. All seven of his brothers engaged in military service, a point which he emphasized in his political races.\n\nOurso was sometimes called \"The Black Stallion\", the name of the family trucking company. Ourso and his wife, the former Eula Mae Leblanc (1933-1996), had six children, Jessel M. Ourso, Jr. (born 1953), Blane Michael Ourso (born 1955), Vesta Ourso Falcon, Jessica A. Ourso (born 1958), Lisa Jo Ourso (born 1959), and Shannon Paul Ourso (born 1964).\n\nOurso worked for the Baton Rouge municipal police department and the Louisiana State Police before he was elected Iberville Parish sheriff at the age of thirty-one. He unseated the 16-year incumbent, Charles A. Griffon, Jr., of Plaquemine, the paternal grandfather of the statewide radio talk show host, Moon Griffon of Monroe in northeastern Louisiana. Ourso claimed that he had won the Democratic primary election held on December 7, 1963, because he led by a plurality. A third candidate who had withdrawn from the race still received enough scattering of votes to prevent an Ourso majority. Louisiana Attorney General Jack P. F. Gremillion ruled that the votes for the withdrawn candidate still counted for purposes of determining if a candidate had a primary majority. Louisiana State District Judge G. R. Kearney ruled that the third candidate's votes would still be counted and that the runoff election between Ouro and Griffon must proceed on January 11, 1964, along with the gubernatorial contest between the successful John McKeithen and former New Orleans Mayor DeLesseps Story Morrison.\n\nAs sheriff, Ourso established the Iberville Parish \"Junior Deputy\" and prison work-release programs. He organized a sheriff's flotilla to cover swamplands and waterways. He introduced the psychological stress evaluator in the investigation of crimes. He established the first ambulance service in Iberville Parish and was the first Iberville Parish sheriff to use a helicopter. He built a firing range for deputies and opened it to the public. Ourso established sheriff's sub-stations with deputies on duty around the clock. He constructed a new $2 million jail, completed in 1977, the year before his death.\n\nDespite his accomplishments, Ourso is also remembered for many controversies. The Louisiana Legislative Auditor accused him of failure to account for funds received from construction and engineering firms as payment of guard and security services that the sheriff's department had provided to the companies. Then state Attorney General Gremillion charged Ourso with ninety-six allegations of wrongdoing. Governor McKeithen suspended Ourso from office and refused his signature to the commission for Ourso to take office for his second term in the summer of 1968. From 1968 to 1971, Ourso fought federal charges of extortion and thirty-three state criminal allegations brought forth by Attorney General Jack Gremillion, including bribery, theft, extortion, and malfeasance. Ourso was either acquitted or benefited from hung juries in all of these cases.\n\nOuro was elected sheriff again in 1971 with the slogan that U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona had employed in the 1964 U.S. presidential election: \"In Your Heart, You Know He's Right.\" While continuing as sheriff, Ourso in 1972 was elected to the nonpartisan position of delegate to the 1973 Louisiana Constitutional Convention. Others elected to the convention were future Governor Buddy Roemer and subsequent Louisiana Secretary of State James H. \"Jim\" Brown.\n\nOn November 1, 1975, at the age of forty-three, Ourso defeated five challengers to win his last abbreviated term as sheriff in the first-ever nonpartisan blanket primary held in Louisiana.\n\nKnown for his public speaking, Ourso was described by Gary J. Hebert, the late publisher of the \"Post/South\" newspaper in Plaquemine, as \"unequaled in color, startling in analogies, disarmingly devious in approach, and at times, just downright funny to the point of tears.\"\n\nOurso died in Houston, Texas, at the age of forty-six. According to the former \"Iberville South\", four thousand mourners visited the funeral home where Ourso's body lay in state, two thousand came to St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church for the funeral mass, hundreds of others lined the route of the funeral procession, and eight hundred witnessed the burial at Grace Memorial Park in Plaquemine. Ourso was succeeded by his chief criminal deputy, Freddie H. Pitre (1929-2002), the sheriff from 1978 to 2000.\n\nOurso's older son, Jessel Mitchell Ourso, Jr., known as Mitch Ourso, is the first and still serving President of Iberville Parish, having been initially elected to a two-year term in 1997. Mitch Ourso said that his mother had asked all of her children to avoid politics, and he did so until a year after her death when he \"still rode my dad's political coattails into office as parish president. He was one popular politician in Iberville Parish.\"\n\nIn 2009, Ourso was inducted posthumously into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. Only four other sheriffs have been so designated, Cat Doucet, Charles Fuselier, Leonard R. \"Pop\" Hataway, and Harry Lee. In 2010, he was inducted into the Louisiana Justice Hall of Fame by the Louisiana State Penitentiary Museum Foundation.\n"}

During the War for Independence, as a member of the militia from Tryon County, Hardin fought the Cherokee allies of Britain along the western frontier and was a signatory of the Tryon Resolves. Later in the war, having taken his family over the Appalachian Mountains to the Washington District for safety against the advance of the Red Coats out of South Carolina, Hardin joined the Overmountain Men. He saw action at the Battle of Ramsour's Mill and the decisive Battle of Kings Mountain. Following the peace with Britain, Hardin was a co-founder and second Speaker of the House for the State of Franklin; and an Assemblyman in the Southwest Territory before its statehood as Tennessee.\n\nJoseph Hardin was born the spring of 1734 in Henrico Co., Virginia Colony in an area several years later to be encompassed by the fledgling town of Richmond at the Falls (now Richmond), Virginia Colony.\n\nHardin was the second son, and fourth child, of Benjamin Hardin II and Margaret Hooper. He was older brother to Captain John Hardin (1736–1802) (noted as the hero who turned the tide of battle for the patriots at the Battle of Ramsour's Mill during the \"Southern Campaign\" of the Revolutionary War) and Sarah Hardin, wife to Lt. Col. Frederick Hambright.\n\nHardin married Jane Gibson (1742–1817) on July 8, 1762 in Virginia. They moved to the 'Salisbury District' of the North Carolina Colony, settling in the newly formed Tryon County, where he became Justice of the Peace in 1772.\n\nHardin's children were: Rebecca; twins Joseph Jr. and John; Jane Ann; James W.; Benjamin I; Robert I; Elender; Mary Easter; Margaret; Amos; Benjamin II; Gibson; and Robert II. \"Ben-two\" and \"Robert-two\", as they were called, were both named after older brothers who had been lost in battle with Native Americans.\n\nHardin was a great-grandfather of Texas outlaw, John Wesley Hardin.\n\nHardin served several stints as a local Justice of the Peace: first in Tryon County, NC (April 1772 – 1778); then Washington Co., NC (Tennessee East District) (1783); and finally Greene Co. (1796). He served as an Assemblyman (Representative) for Tryon Co., NC (1774–1779); for Washington County (Washington District, North Carolina) (1782) and, Greene Co., Tennessee East District, NC (1788). Hardin became a signer of the Tryon Resolves in September 1775.\n\nDuring the period of 1784-1785, Hardin, John Sevier, and several others were instrumental in organizing the extra-legal State of Franklin. He was elected its second Speaker of the House in June 1785. A few years after the failure of Franklin, he served as a representative for the First Territorial Assembly of the Southwest Territory (also known as the Territory South of the Ohio River) held at Knoxville, Tennessee in the summer of 1794. Later that same year, Hardin became a trustee of the newly chartered Greeneville (later Tusculum) College. He was elevated to Speaker of the House in the territorial assembly in 1795.\n\nHardin's first documented military service shows his appointment as the first major of the 2nd North Carolina Minute Men (from the Salisbury District) in 1775. That same year, he appears in the rolls as a captain in the Griffith Rutherford's Light Horse Rangers. Hardin took part in Rutherford's Cherokee Expedition into the Washington District late the following year, under Captain William Moore. Beginning in 1777, Hardin carried a captain's commission in Locke's Battalion (part of General Allen Jones' Brigade) seeing action against Britain and its Native American allies.\n\nIt was during this time that Hardin moved his family to the western settlements for safe keeping. As a major in the North Carolina militia, he raised a battalion of volunteers in Wilkes County in early 1779. As an officer in this Overmountain militia, he fought in the Battle of Ramseur's Mill, between the Tories (Loyalists to the Crown) and the Whigs (American Patriots) on June 20, 1780 and later that year at the Battle of Kings Mountain, on Oct 7.\n\nAfter the cessation of the ground war with Britain (1783), Hardin, then living in the newly established Greene County, was promoted to colonel and appointed Commandant of the North Carolina Militia for \"The Western Counties\" (old Washington District) due to the continuing hostilities with the Chickamauga Indians.\n\nAs was the custom of the time, he was awarded land grants totaling for service to his country. In 1786, several thousand acres of this land was set aside for Col. Hardin in what later became Hardin County, Tennessee.\n\nAlthough he himself never set foot in that region, on March 11, 1786 the land along the far western reaches of the Tennessee River was surveyed by Isaac Taylor and warrants were drawn on behalf of Hardin for in what was to become Hardin County, Tennessee However, due to legal trouble with squatters and the wildness of that area in Tennessee, it was thirty years before his family could settle there.\n\nHardin died July 4, 1801. He is interred at the Hickory Creek Cemetery, Hardin Valley, Knox Co., TN. There is a large monument dedicated to Hardin at the site. The inscription reads:\n\nTwo parties of settlers (totaling 26) struck out of Knoxville, Tennessee in late spring of 1816 bound for the general area which would eventually become Savannah, Tennessee. The first party came by boat down the Tennessee River, landing in May at \"the easteward curve of the Tennessee\" at Cerro Gordo. The second, and larger, party had travelled overland and suffered from many delays. Upon the arrival of the second group, the parties finally rejoined at Johnson Creek, near present-day Savannah, Tennessee. It was now July, and the pioneers set about the laying down of the first permanent settlement by non-Native Americans in the area.\n\nThis second party was led by Joseph Hardin Jr., son of Col. Joseph Hardin, who had, before his death, accumulated several land grants to the area as rewards for his Revolutionary War service. Joseph Jr. was accompanied on the trip by his brother, James Hardin (known as the founder of the settlement of Hardinville; a failed endeavor that would be created in 1817 on nearby Hardin's Creek). Both men executed land grants in the area. They had fought alongside their father in the war and had been likewise rewarded with their own land patents, and had inherited some of their father's remaining unclaimed grants. About this same time, other settlers from the initial expedition established a community further down river at Saltillo.\n\nOther relatives of Col. Joseph's were to eventually settle in the area, including sons: Gibson, Ben II and Robert II, and daughter, Margaret (wife of Ninian Steele), all having arrived there by 1818.\n\nThe county was named posthumously for Joseph Hardin Sr. in November 1819, at the first meeting of the county assembly which took place at the home of his son, James Hardin. Today, the courthouse in the county seat of Savannah is dedicated to him.\n\n"}

He lived there for two years, sometimes coming down to the village to preach, treat the sick and catechize children.\nIn April 1869 the villagers did not see his fire, went up to his cave and found him dead. He had been murdered by some person who was never found. He died on 17 April 1869 at the age of 69. João Maria's tomb may still be seen in New Mexico.\n\nJoão Maria D’Agostini inspired others who became mendicants in Brazil in the following decades, and was the first of the three \"monks\" named João Maria in southern Brazil.\nSome widely distributed photographs with the legend \"Jõao Maria de Agostinho Propheta\" are in fact pictures of the later monk, João Maria de Jesus.\nThere are people today who think that João Maria, now more than 200 years old, still wanders in the region and works his miracles.\nThere are many places in the center and east of Paraná and Santa Catarina, the south of São Paulo and the north of Rio Grande do Sul, where a small altar or cross marks a place where one of the \"João Marias\" would have passed.\n\nThe Monge State Park was created in Lapa in 1960.\nThe main attraction is the monk's cave, a place of religious pilgrimage for thousands of faithful. It also includes a source of water that it considered to be miraculous.\n\n"}
{"id": "3589417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3589417", "title": "Lily Elsie", "text": "Lily Elsie\n\nLily Elsie (born Elsie Hodder; 8 April 1886 – 16 December 1962) was an English actress and singer during the Edwardian era. She was best known for her starring role in the London premiere of Franz Lehár's operetta \"The Merry Widow\".\n\nBeginning as a child star in the 1890s, Elsie built her reputation in several successful Edwardian musical comedies before her great success in \"The Merry Widow\", opening in 1907. Afterwards, she starred in several more successful operettas and musicals, including \"The Dollar Princess\" (1909), \"A Waltz Dream\" (1911) and \"The Count of Luxembourg\" (1911). Admired for her beauty and charm on stage, Elsie became one of the most photographed women of Edwardian times.\n\nElsie was born in Armley, West Yorkshire. Her mother, Charlotte Elizabeth Hodder (1864–1922), was a dressmaker who operated a lodging-house. She married William Thomas Cotton, a theatre worker, in 1891, and Elsie became Elsie Cotton. The family lived in Manchester. Elsie was also the niece of Wilfred Cotton, who married actress Ada Reeve.\n\nA precocious child star, Elsie appeared in music hall and variety entertainments as a child impersonator known as \"Little Elsie\". Nevertheless, she was reportedly painfully shy, even as an adult. By 1895–96, she appeared in concerts and pantomimes in theatres in Salford. In 1896, she played the role of Princess Mirza in \"The Arabian Nights\" at the Queen's Theatre in Manchester. Then, at Christmas 1896–97, at the age of ten, she appeared in the title role of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" at the same theatre for six weeks and then on tour for six additional weeks. Her first London appearance was at Christmas 1898 in \"King Klondike\" at Sara Lane's Britannia Theatre as Aerielle, the Spirit of the Air. Elsie then toured the provinces, travelling as far as Bristol and Hull for a full year in \"McKenna's Flirtation\", a farce by American E. Selden, in 1900. She then played in Christmas pantomimes, including \"Dick Whittington\" (1901), \"The Forty Thieves\" (1902), and \"Blue Beard\" (1903) and toured in Edwardian musical comedies, including \"The Silver Slipper\" by Owen Hall, with music by Leslie Stuart (1901–02), and \"Three Little Maids\" (1903). From about 1900, she adopted the stage name \"Lily Elsie\".\n\nElsie then joined George Edwardes' company at Daly's Theatre in London as a chorus girl. In 1903, she took over the role of Princess Soo-Soo in the hit musical \"A Chinese Honeymoon\" and then starred in the flop, \"Madame Sherry\", by Hugo Felix, at the Apollo Theatre. She next played the roles of Gwenny Holden in \"Lady Madcap\", Lady Patricia Vereker in \"The Cingalee\" in 1904, Madame du Tertre in \"The Little Michus\" in 1905, and Lady Agnes Congress in \"The Little Cherub\" (during which, she was fired by Edwardes for giggling, but soon rehired), Humming Bird in \"See See\" and Lally in \"The New Aladdin\" at the Gaiety Theatre, all in 1906. From 1900 to 1906, she appeared in 14 shows.\n\nElsie's biggest success came in creating the title role in the English-language version of \"The Merry Widow\" in the London production. Edwardes took Elsie to see the original German version (\"Die Lustige Witwe\") in Berlin. Elsie was at first reluctant to take on the demanding part, thinking her voice too light for the role, but Edwardes persuaded her to accept. Edwardes brought her to see the famous designer, Lucile, for a style coaching. Lucile later wrote, \"I realised that here was a girl who had both beauty and intelligence but who had never learnt how to make the best of herself. So shy and diffident was she in those days that a less astute producer than George Edwardes would in all probability have passed her over and left her in the chorus.\" The production, with English lyrics by Adrian Ross, opened in June 1907 and ran for 778 performances at Daly's Theatre. Elsie created the role at Daly's and toured with it beginning in August 1908. The show was an enormous success for its creators and made Elsie a major star. One critic at the opening night praised \"the youthfulness, the dainty charm and grace, the prettiness and the exquisite dancing with which Miss Elsie invests the part... I share the opinion of most of the first-nighters, who considered it could not have been in better hands, and could not have been better handled... The night was a genuine triumph for Miss Elsie, and she well deserved all the calls she received.\"\n\nLucile designed the costumes for Elsie in \"The Merry Widow\" (including the plumed hats that became an extraordinary fad) and thereafter used Elsie to promote her fashions, designing her personal clothes and costumes for several of her other shows. Lucile wrote, \"That season was a very brilliant one, perhaps the most brilliant of the series which brought the social life of pre-war London to its peak. And just when it was at its zenith a new play was launched with a new actress, who set the whole town raving over her beauty...\" Elsie's image was in great demand by advertisers and on postcards, and she received unsolicited gifts of great value from many male admirers (and even bequests). Lucile commented, \"She was absolutely indifferent to most [men] for she once told me she disliked the male character and considered that men only behaved tolerably to a woman who treated them coldly\". Nevertheless, Elsie became one of the most frequently photographed beauties of the Edwardian era. According to the \"Atlanta Constitution\" newspaper in America, writing in 1915:\n\nAfter \"The Merry Widow\", Elsie appeared in another 16 shows, including in the very successful English-language versions of \"The Dollar Princess\" in 1909; as Franzi in the British premiere of \"A Waltz Dream\" in 1911; and as Angèle in \"The Count of Luxembourg\", also in 1911, garnering continuous praise. One critic wrote that \"it gave great pleasure merely to see her walk across the stage.\"\n\nElsie left the cast of \"The Count of Luxembourg\" to marry 6' 3\" Major John Ian Bullough (1885–1936), the son of a wealthy textile manufacturer, but the marriage was reported to be mostly unhappy. In addition, Elsie often suffered from ill health, including anaemia, among other ailments, and had several operations during her years onstage. The gossip column in \"The Pelican\" called her \"the occasional actress\". Bullough wanted his wife to retire from the stage. The publicity shy and exhausted Elsie was happy to leave the stage for the next several years, except for charity performances to benefit the war effort. She returned in the title role of Louis Parker's comedy play \"Malvourneen\" with Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre, as Lady Catherine Lazenby in \"The Admirable Crichton\" in 1916 and in the title role in \"Pamela\" written by Arthur Wimperis, with songs by Frederic Norton (1917; with Owen Nares). \"The Tatler\" wrote of her performance in \"Malvourneen\", \"Everyone should see Miss Lily Elsie in this play, for it shows us that her comedy is as good as her musical comedy, which is saying a great deal.\"\n\nIn 1920, Elsie moved with her husband to the Gloucestershire village of Redmarley D'Abitot. She spent ten years away from the stage this time, enjoying social events and fox hunting. She returned to performing, first touring and then appearing at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in London in 1927 as Eileen Mayne in \"The Blue Train\", the English language adaptation of Robert Stolz's German musical comedy \"Mädi\". Her last show before retiring was Ivor Novello's successful \"The Truth Game\" back at Daly's Theatre in 1928–1929.\n\nFinally, in 1930, Elsie's unhappy marriage ended in divorce as her health deteriorated further and she became subject to fits of ill temper. She became a hypochondriac and spent much time in nursing homes and Swiss sanatoria. She was diagnosed as having serious psychological ailments and underwent brain surgery that reportedly resulted in an improvement in her health. Her last years were spent at St. Andrew's Hospital in London.\n\nElsie died at St. Andrew's Hospital (demolished in 1973), Cricklewood, London, aged 76, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.\n\nFrom \"Pamela\", Duets with Owen Nares.

Within two months, he became a central figure in exposing the Olympus scandal, having been removed from his position after serving two weeks, when he persisted in questioning fees in excess of $US1 billion that Olympus had paid to obscure companies, which appear to have been used to hide old losses and appeared to have organised crime connections. The scandal rocked Japanese corporate governance, led to the resignation of the entire Olympus board and several arrests of senior executives, including the previous CEO and chairman, and the company's former auditor and bankers among others, and made Woodford one of the most highly placed executives to turn whistleblower. By 2012 the scandal he exposed had developed into one of the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan.\n\nHis bravery and stance in the scandal, in which he understood his life was at risk due to the criminal organisation connections of some of the suspect monies he had questioned, earned him several prestigious awards for \"Businessperson of the Year\".\n\nFollowing a settlement for defamation and wrongful dismissal by Olympus, Woodford now consults on corporate governance worldwide, speaks on human rights, whistleblower laws and road safety. He also undertakes philanthropy, and has stated he has given several millions of pounds to charities. In November 2012 Woodford published a book about the Olympus scandal, and a film was also underway.\n\nWoodford was born in Staffordshire, but moved to Liverpool with his mother when he was seven after his parents divorced. Woodford attended the King David High School, Liverpool in Liverpool.\n\nAccording to the Olympus website, Woodford, a graduate of Millbank College of Commerce, joined KeyMed, a UK medical-equipment unit of Olympus, in 1981.\n\nIn 2008 he became executive managing director of Olympus Europa Holding GmbH. Woodford had originally flown to Tokyo to submit his resignation after Olympus purchased Gyrus, a move that would have normally been under Woodford's direct authority but instead had been arranged directly by Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, the then-chairman, president, and CEO of Olympus. Kikukawa instead made Woodford head of all of Olympus's Europe operations and gave him a seat on the board of directors.\n\nIn February 2011, due to substantial growth in the European businesses, Woodford was promoted to company president, while Kikukawa stayed on as chairman and CEO. It was reported that Woodford clashed with Kikukawa after outside media sources began investigating some of Olympus's questionable acquisitions, which eventually compelled Kikukawa to give up his title as CEO.\n\nOn 30 September 2011 Woodford was appointed chief executive officer of Olympus Corporation, after 30 years of working for the group, while Kikukawa remained as chairman of the board. He was the first non-Japanese person to be appointed as the company's CEO, making Olympus one of the few Japanese companies to be headed by a foreign businessman (others include Sony, Nissan Motors and Mazda). As the top executive officer in the company, Woodford would have been responsible for selecting his management team. At the time of Woodford's appointment, he was regarded as an unlikely choice. Reuters reports there were rumours that he only got the job because he would be \"easy to control\"; some Japanese observers saw Woodford, who speaks no Japanese, as the chairman Kikukawa's new pet. An article in \"FACTA\" underlined the sceptics' views, saying \"The fact that the company picked a bottom-ranking foreign executive director with virtually no significant responsibilities from amongst a total pool of 25 potential candidates, including the vice-president who was responsible for medical instruments ... set tongues a-wagging.\"\n\nUpon becoming CEO, Woodford discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars had been transferred from Olympus to advisers and companies located in places such as the Cayman Islands. After attempting to seek answers as to why the questionable transactions took place, he was dismissed from his position as President and CEO on 14 October 2011, although he retained his seat on the board of directors. As a result of Woodford's ousting, board chairman Kikukawa reassumed the titles of president and CEO but resigned these positions on 26 October 2011 and was succeeded by Shuichi Takayama. 19 top current and former executives, including six present board members (including Takayama who resigned all his positions and left the company at an extraordinary general meeting in April 2012) are defendants to a lawsuit.\n\nFearing for his safety after his dismissal, Woodford immediately left Japan and flew to England. After arrival in London he offered to speak to investigators. \nHe returned to Tokyo on 23 November and later met with investigators and, under police escort, Olympus personnel.\n\nOn 30 November 2011, Woodford resigned from the Olympus board but said that he had an \"alternative plan\" to manage the company by staging a proxy fight. However it has been reported that Woodford was rejected by Olympus's institutional investors because they were \"uncomfortable with the Englishman's combative style and also his plans to recapitalise the company through private equity or a rights issue\". On 6 January 2012, on failing to secure support from Japanese institutional shareholders, Woodford announced that he would abandon his proxy fight to take control of the Olympus board. Instead, his lawyers had initiated legal proceedings in London seeking unspecified damages for dismissal from his four-year contract. Woodford said that the 12-week public scandal had taken an enormous emotional toll on him and his family: \"I’m not superman. I can’t change opinion in Japan in such a profound way. That has to come from within.\"\n\nIn June 2012, Woodford was awarded £10 million in an out-of-court settlement with Olympus over his dismissal.\n\nSince 2012, Woodford consults on corporate governance worldwide, speaks on human rights, whistleblower laws and road safety. In November 2012 Woodford published a book about the Olympus scandal, and a film was also underway.\n\nWoodford stated in 2014 his concerns that far from learning from the scandal, Japan's response was to become even more secretive and unsupportive of change in areas highlighted by the scandal.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "482979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=482979", "title": "Og", "text": "Og\n\nOg (, \"‘Ōḡ\" ; , \"ûĝ\" ) according to the Hebrew Bible, was an Amorite king of Bashan who, along with his army, was slain by Moses and his men at the battle of Edrei. In Arabic literature he is referred to as ‘Uj ibn Anaq (‘Ûj ibn ‘Anâq عوج بن عنق).\n\nOg is introduced in the Book of Numbers. Like his neighbor Sihon of Heshbon, whom Moses had previously conquered at the battle of Jahaz, he was an Amorite king, the ruler of Bashan, which contained sixty walled cities and many unwalled towns, with his capital at Ashtaroth (probably modern \"Tell Ashareh\", where there still exists a 70-foot mound).\n\nThe Book of Numbers, Chapter 21, and Deuteronomy, Chapter 3, continues:\n\nOg's destruction is told in Psalms 135:11 and 136:20 as one of many great victories for the nation of Israel, and the Book of Amos 2:9 may refer to Og as \"the Amorite\" whose height was like the height of the cedars and whose strength was like that of the oaks.\n\nOg's existence and true identity is disputed.\n\nIn Deut. 3:11 and later in the book of Numbers and Joshua, Og is called the last of the Rephaim. Rephaim is a Hebrew word for giants. Deut. 3:11 declares that his \"bedstead\" (translated in some texts as \"sarcophagus\") of iron is \"nine cubits in length and four cubits in width\", which is 13.5 ft by 6 ft according to the standard cubit of a man. It goes on to say that at the royal city of Rabbah of the Ammonites, his giant bedstead could still be seen as a novelty at the time the narrative was written. If the giant king's bedstead was built in proportion to his size as most beds are, he may have been between 9 and 13 feet in height. However, later Rabbinic tradition has it, that the length of his bedstead was measured with the cubits of Og himself. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the region north of the river Jabbok, or Bashan, \"the land of Rephaim\", contains hundreds of megalithic stone tombs (dolmen) dating from the 5th to 3rd millennia BC. In 1918, Gustav Dalman discovered in the neighborhood of Amman, Jordan (Amman is built on the ancient city of Rabbah of Ammon) a noteworthy dolmen which matched the approximate dimensions of Og's bed as described in the Bible. Such ancient rock burials are seldom seen west of the Jordan river, and the only other concentration of these megaliths are to be found in the hills of Judah in the vicinity of Hebron, where the giant sons of Anak were said to have lived (Numbers 13:33).\n\nA reference to \"Og\" appears in a Phoenician inscription from Byblos (Byblos 13) published in 1974 by Wolfgang Rölling in \"Eine neue phoenizische Inschrift aus Byblos,\" (Neue Ephemeris für Semitische Epigraphik, vol 2, 1-15 and plate 1). It appears in a damaged 7-line funerary inscription that Rölling dates to around 500 BC, and appears to say that if someone disturbs the bones of the occupant, \"the mighty Og will avenge me.\"\n\nA possible connection to Og and the Rephaim kings of Bashan can also be made with the much older Canaanite Ugaritic text KTU 1.108 from the 13th century B.C., which uses the term \"king\" in association with the root /rp/ or \"Rapah\" (the Rephaim of the Bible) and geographic place names that probably correspond to the cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei in the Bible, and with which king Og is expressly said to have ruled from (Deuteronomy 1:4; Joshua 9:10; 12:4; 13:12, 31). The clay tablet from Ugarit KTU 1.108 reads in whole, \"May Rapiu, King of Eternity, drink [w]ine, yea, may he drink, the powerful and noble [god], the god enthroned in Ashtarat, the god who rules in Edrei, whom men hymn and honour with music on the lyre and the flute, on drum and cymbals, with castanets of ivory, among the goodly companions of Kothar. And may Anat the power<ful> drink, the mistress of kingship, the mistress of dominion, the mistress of the high heavens, [the mistre]ss of the earth.\"\n\nThe Jewish Talmud embellishes the story, stating that Og was so large that he sought the destruction of the Israelites by uprooting a mountain so large, that it would have crushed the entire Israelite encampment. The Lord caused a swarm of ants to dig away the center of the mountain, which was resting on Og's head. The mountain then fell onto Og's shoulders. As Og attempted to lift the mountain off himself, the Lord caused Og's teeth to lengthen outward, becoming embedded into the mountain that was now surrounding his head. Moses, fulfilling the LORD's injunction not to fear him, seized a stick of ten cubits length, and jumped a similar vertical distance, succeeding in striking Og in the ankle. Og fell down and died upon hitting the ground.\nMany great rabbis notably Shlomo ibn Aderet have explained this story in an allegorical manner.\n\n'Uj ibn Anaq ('Ûj ibn 'Anâq) is a giant in Islamic mythology although not mentioned in the Quran. The origins of this character lay in Jewish folklore and the Old Testament, e.g. king Og.

She was married in May 1835 to Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan, 6th Baronet.\n\nPaulina (known as Pauline) Jermyn was the eldest child of George Bitton Jermyn (1789–1857), of Hawkedon Parsonage, who, to ensure the Jermyn surname survived, added it as her second Christian name. Her mother was of Huguenot descendancy.\n\nThe marriage between artist Pauline Jermyn, the penniless daughter of a clergyman and the rich, teetotal, vegetarian Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan was an unlikely, but not surprisingly successful arrangement—their common interest in geology and art ensured their compatibility and the childless marriage allowed them to channel their creativity to other ends. William Bell Scott said of her,\n\"a true woman, but without vanity, and very likely without the passion of love.\"\n\nShortly before proposing to Pauline, Walter had made his future wife a gift of a box of fossils. Walter had been described as \"an intellectual of a dry professional order\". He was the owner of Wallington estate from 1846 until his death. Besides being a distinguished geologist, he had a great interest in botany and was an authority on farming methods, winning awards for his cattle. His strict views on alcohol led to the dumping of his father’s wine collection into a nearby lake. Pauline had met him in 1833 at a Cambridge conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. She had been schooled in Greek, French, Latin, German, and Italian, and her interests were science, literature and the fine arts. She wrote pieces for the Edinburgh Review and The Scotsman. On her first visit to her husband's family at Wallington, she was inspired by Richard Grainger and John Dobson's redevelopment of nearby Newcastle. Walter may have been a respected scientist, but he was eclipsed by Pauline who had become the focal point for an enormous array of poets, painters and writers. It was during this period that the Central Hall evolved. In earlier days the house was surrounded by an unattractive courtyard, until Ruskin suggested that it be roofed, so that in 1855 this was done under his and John Dobson's supervision. Ruskin, of whom Pauline was a great admirer and confidante, is said to have designed the first floor balustrade. William Bell Scott, then an art teacher in Newcastle, with help from Pauline, Ruskin and Arthur Hughes, painted panels in the Hall showing figures and scenes from the history of Northumberland in Pre-Raphaelite style. Pauline was one of the earliest northern English patrons of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (his first having been another northern woman, Ellen Heaton, daughter of a Leeds bookseller, in 1855).\n\nPauline had also been very friendly with Ruskin's wife Effie, but took Ruskin's side when their marriage was annulled in 1854 and subsequently shunned Effie's attempts to maintain contact with her. The previous summer the Ruskins had spent a protracted artistic holiday in the Scottish Highlands with the Pre-Raphaelite painter John Millais and his brother William. En route to Scotland the party stayed with the Trevelyans at Wallington. Pauline noticed that Ruskin and Effie (whose unconsummated marriage was under great strain) spent most of their time apart, but also seems to have been put out by Effie's flirtatious behaviour with John Millais and their lengthy absences together from the house. Even so, she was complimentary about Effie's appearance at an evening party at which she wore flowers in her hair, a stylistic trait that subsequently irritated Ruskin, came to the disapproving notice of Florence Nightingale, and inspired a painting by Millais (\"Effie with Foxgloves in her Hair\", 1853), whom Effie married in 1855.\n\nPauline was buried at Neuchâtel. Every year, many visitors come to appreciate her contribution to humanity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1534005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1534005", "title": "Quick &amp; Flupke", "text": "Quick &amp; Flupke\n\nThe exploits of Quick and Flupke () is a comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Serialised weekly from January 1930 to 1940 in , the children's supplement of conservative Belgian newspaper (\"\"The Twentieth Century\"), the series ran alongside Hergé's better known \"The Adventures of Tintin\".\n\nIt revolves around the lives of two misbehaving boys, Quick and Flupke, who live in Brussels, and the conflict that they get into with a local policeman.\n\nIn 1983, the series provided the basis for an animated television adaptation.\n\nAbbé Norbert Wallez appointed Hergé editor of a children's supplement for the Thursday issues of , titled (\"The Little Twentieth\"\"). Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly anti-semitic. For this new venture, Hergé illustrated \"L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet\" (\"The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet\"), a comic strip authored by one of the paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium – such as the systematic use of speech bubbles – found in such American comics as George McManus' \"Bringing up Father\", George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat\" and Rudolph Dirks's \"Katzenjammer Kids\", copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter Léon Degrelle, stationed there to report on the Cristero War.\n\nHergé developed a character named Tintin as a Belgian boy reporter who could travel the world with his fox terrier, Snowy – \"Milou\" in the original French – basing him in large part on his earlier character of Totor and also on his own brother, Paul. Although Hergé wanted to send his character to the United States, Wallez instead ordered him to set his adventure in the Soviet Union, acting as a work of anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\", began serialisation in \"Le Petit Vingtième\" on 10 January 1929, and ran until 8 May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organized a publicity stunt at the Gare de Nord station, following which he organized the publication of the story in book form. The popularity of the story led to an increase in sales, and so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants, Eugène Van Nyverseel and Paul \"Jam\" Jamin.\n\nAccording to one of Hergé's later recollections, he had returned to work following a holiday to find that the staff had publicly announced that he would be producing a new series, as a joke on his expense. Obliged to the commitment, he had to develop a new strip with only a few days notice. In devising a scenario, he was influenced by the French film \"Les Deux gosses\" (\"The two kids\"), released the previous year, as well as by his own childhood in Brussels. Other cinematic influences included the films of Charlie Chaplin, upon whom the policemen are based.\nThe strip first appeared in on 23 January 1930, at the time starring Quick without Flupke. Quick appeared on the cover of that issue, stating \"Hello, friends. Don't you know me? I'm Quick, a kid from Brussels, and beginning today I'll be here every Thursday to tell you what happened to me during the week.\" Hergé borrowed the name \"Quipke\" from one of his friends. Three weeks later he added the second boy as a sidekick, naming him \"Suske\". He would soon be renamed \"Flupke\" (\"Little Philip\" in Flemish). \"Quick et Flupke\" would be published in every Thursday for the next six years. Hergé devoted little time to the series, typically only starting work on each strip on the morning of the day that the page were being typset, proceeding to rush to finish them within one or two hours. Jamin thought that Hergé had greater difficulty with \"Quick and Flupke\" than with \"The Adventures of Tintin\", because of the need for a completely new idea each week.\n\nHergé used the strip as a vehicle for jokes not considered appropriate for \"The Adventures of Tintin\". In particular he made repeated allusions to the fact that the strip was a cartoon; in one example, Flupke walks onto the ceiling, flies around, and then throws Quick's detached head into the air, before waking up to proclaim \"Thank goodness it wasn't real! Hergé isn't still making us act like cartoons!\" Hergé inserted himself into the strip on numerous occasions; in \"The Kidnapping of Hergé\", Quick and Flupke kidnap Hergé from his office, and force him to sign a statement proclaiming \"I, the undersigned, Hergé, declare that, contrary to how I make it seem every week, the parties of Quick and Flupke are good, smart, obedient, etc., etc.\"\n\nThroughout the series, Hergé would give characters names that illustrated a play on words, such as the veterinarian M. Moraurat (\"mort aux rats\", \"death to rats\"), and the two boxers Sam Suffy (\"ça me suffit\", \"It's good enough for me\") and Mac Aronni (\"macaroni\"). He also included references to present events, in one instance lampooning Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. In another, the boys listen to a radio program filled with nationalistic proclamations from Hitler, Mussolini, Neville Chamberlain, Édouard Herriot, a Bolshevik, and a Japanese, after which they run away to listen to an organ grinder.\n\nIn late 1935, the editors of \"Cœurs Vaillants\" (\"Valiant Hearts\"), a Catholic newspaper who published \"The Adventures of Tintin\" in France, requested that Hergé create a series about protagonists with a family. Hergé agreed, creating the \"Jo, Zette and Jocko\" series, but soon found himself overworked in writing and drawing three comics at once. \"Quick & Flupke\" were subsequently put on the back burner.\n\nFor New Year 1938, Hergé designed a special cover for \"Le Petit Vingtième\" in which the characters of \"Quick & Flupke\" were featured alongside those from \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and \"Jo, Zette and Jocko\".\nHergé eventually abandoned the series in order to spend more time on \"The Adventures of Tintin\", his more famous comic series.\n\nAfter Hergé's death, the books were coloured by the Studios Hergé and re-issued by the publishing house Casterman in 12 volumes, between 1985 and 1991.\n\nHergé biographer Pierre Assouline asserted that the strip was \"completely opposite in spirit\" to Hergé's preceding \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\", due to the fact that it was \"utterly lacking in ambiguity or cynicism.\" He thought it unfair that they had been eclipsed by the fame of \"The Adventures of Tintin\", because they have a \"lightness of touch, a charm, a tenderness and poetry\" that are absent from the rest of Hergé's work. Considering them to be an updated version of the German author Wilhelm Busch's characters Max and Moritz.\n\nAnother of Hergé's biographers, Benoît Peeters, thought that \"Quick and Flupke\" worked as a \"perfect counterpoint\" to \"The Adventures of Tintin\", contrasting two-strip jokes with long stories, familiarity with exoticism, and the boys' fight against order with Tintin's fight to impose it. He also thought it noteworthy that in the series, family bonds are \"reduced to their simplest expression\", with parental figures rarely appearing and the protagonists this growing up \"more or less alone, protecting them as best they can against a monotonous adult world\".\nTintinologist Phillipe Goddin believed that the series expressed Hergé's \"affection for his Brussels roots.\"\n\nUnlike Hergé's other series there is no real chronological order to the books, though often the order that they were published in is used.\n\nInitially published in September 1985 as \"Haute Tension\".

The EZW (literally: Protestant Centre for Questions on World Views) is a subdivision of the Evangelical Church in Germany. Located in Berlin, it professes to function as a centralized research, documentation and information center on new religious movements. Hummel is also the author of many books about new religious movements.\n\nHummel studied Protestant theology and received his Ph.D. in 1963 for the thesis \"Die Auseinandersetzung zwischen Kirche und Judentum im Matthäusevangelium\" (literally The dialog between church and Judaism in the gospel of Matthew). Subsequently, he worked as a pastor in Schleswig Holstein. From 1966 until 1972 he led the Lutheranian theological college in Orissa, India. Back in Germany he received a request to research Indian guru movements at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg. He received the right to lecture with his work \"Indische Mission und neue Frömmigkeit im Westen. Religiöse Bewegungen in westlichen Kulturen“, (literally: Indian mission and new piety in the West: religious movements in western cultures) that was published by the Kohlhammer group.\n\nFrom 1981 until 1994 he was director of the EZW. In his work he disagreed with the concept and explanatory model of \"Jugendreligion\" (literally youth religion) for new religious communities, as it was popularized by among others the German author Friedrich-Wilhelm Haack (1935–1991). In the beginning he fully rejected the controversial use of the German word \"\" (that is translated sometimes with \"cult\" but also as \"sect\" in English), but in his later works he recognized the justification of the concept in differentiated use.\n\nHe asserted that some of the groups monitored by the EZW had developed both in the society as well as in interfaith dialogue in a positive way, i.e. that they had decreased their original potential for conflict. This assertion was both respected and rejected. It would be especially applicable for the Jehovah's witnesses, the Unification Church, and ISKCON/Hare Krishnas. In spite of this, the Unification Church is still very critical about his assessment of the church.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nGerman\n\n\nEnglish\n\n"}

He spent his early years in South Central Los Angeles and then returned to Hollywood for his adolescence. He became involved with the martial arts and eastern mysticism at an early age.\n\nShaw has had a career in both the arts and the sciences. He first became noticed as an author when his poetry and literary fiction began to be published in literary journals in the late 1970s. Beginning in the mid-1980s Shaw's writings also began to be published on the subjects of anthropology and the social sciences. Though his writings have span many genres, Shaw is most well known as an author on the subject of the martial arts. This is due to the voluminous amount of written work he has composed on the subject. Over three hundred of his articles on the martial arts have been published and he is the author of several books on the subject.\n\nThe foundation for Shaw's writings on the martial arts began when he was six years old. This is the point when he began his study of the Korean martial art of Hapkido.\n\nShaw studied and taught Hapkido and Taekwondo until in 1987 he was the first American to be awarded the 7th Degree Black Belt in Moo Duk Kwan Taekwondo. In 1988 he earned the rank of 7th Degree Black Belt in Kumdo. In 1996 he was the first non-Korean to be promoted to the rank of 7th Degree Black Belt by The Korea Hapkido Federation. Previous to this he had been certified a Hapkido 7th Degree Black Belt in Hapkido Moo Hak Kwan. Since that time he has been promoted to 8th Degree Black Belt in both Hapkido and Taekwondo.\n\nShaw has also written numerous articles and several books on Zen Buddhism, Yoga, Eastern Religion and Asian culture. His books have been translated into several languages. These writings are based in the fact that from his youth forward Shaw has been involved with eastern philosophy. He was a direct disciple of Swami Satchidananda. In addition, he studied with such teachers as Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan and Thich Thien-An.\n\nBy the age of eighteen he was a certified instructor of Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga. At this point in his life he traveled to India where he was initiated into various Buddhist, Hindu and Sufi sects and became Sannyasa. Shaw is also a Frater Rosae Crucis of the Rosicrucian Order. He is known to frequently travel in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, documenting Asian culture in words and on film.\n\nIn association to his writings, Shaw is also an active actor and filmmaker. In 1991 he developed a new style of filmmaking that he titled Zen Filmmaking. This style of filmmaking is defined by the fact that no screenplay is used in the creation of a film. \"In Zen filmmaking the spontaneous creative energy of the filmmaker is the only defining factor. This allows for a spiritually pure source of immediate inspiration to be the only guide in the filmmaking process.\" He extensively defined this style of filmmaking in his 2008 book \"Zen Filmmaking\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Depending on the threat perception to the person, the category is divided into four tiers: Z+ (highest level), Z, Y and X. Individuals under this security blanket include the President, Vice-President, Prime-Minister, Supreme Court and High Court Judges, Service Chiefs of Indian Armed Forces, Governors of State, Chief Ministers and Cabinet Ministers.\n\n\nThe Z+ level of security is provided by National Security Guard commandos. They are armed with Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns and modern communication equipment, and each member of the team is adept in martial arts and unarmed combat skills. Currently 17 VIPs are provided with such protection. The 'Z' category entails security cover by the Delhi police or the ITBP or CRPF personnel and one escort car. The 'Y' category encompasses two personal security officers (PSOs) and the 'X' category, one PSO.\n\nThe SPG (Special Protection Group), NSG (National Security Guards), ITBP (Indo-Tibetan Border Police) and CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) are the agencies responsible for providing securities to VVIPs, VIPs, politicians, high-profile celebrities and sportspersons. The NSG is used extensively to guard VIPs and VVIPs, especially those in the Z+ category. Many NSG personnel are seconded to the Special Protection Group (SPG) which guards the Prime Minister.\n\nIn some cases being placed in a category is viewed as a status symbol by politicians, and many use their clout to secure a Z+ security cover. This is criticized often by media as a waste of taxpayer's money. Former Home Minister P. Chidambaram phased out the use of the NSG for VIP protection in all but the most serious cases. Nevertheless, controversies arose as many politicians remained under Z+ cover while many bureaucrats were moved down to Y.\n\nIn 2014 as a part of Z security, 25 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force and the Punjab Police were put in attendance for the security of Ashutosh Maharaj, a spiritual leader who has been declared clinically dead by doctors.\n\nIndira Gandhi, former Prime Minister was assassinated by members of her own security detail.

They were the men who in 2003 entered into the first legal same-sex marriage in Canada, and were consequently named the Canadian Newsmakers of the Year by \"Time\" magazine.\n\nLeshner is a lawyer and a Jew, while Stark is a Catholic and a manager involved in graphic design. Leshner was born on April 8, 1948, in Niagara Falls, New York. He then lived in St. Catharines, Ontario and went to Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School. Feeling isolated in small-town Ontario as a homosexual, he went for post-secondary education to the University of Toronto.\n\nIn 1992, Leshner, who worked for the Ontario government, made news when he successfully argued before the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal that the provincial government should allow survivor pensions for gay people. He then told the media he believed that private companies should also allow such pensions for homosexuals, or they could be subject to the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Leshner also said, \"I'm rather hard on the gay and lesbian community in part because I think there's too much emphasis on why you should feel sorry for yourself. Social change will happen as quickly as you're willing to move it. If it doesn't happen, don't blame [Prime Minister Brian] Mulroney.\"\n\nThe 1992 decision led the Ontario New Democratic Party government of Bob Rae to introduce the Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act (Bill 167) in 1994, although the bill failed on second reading amid controversy.\n\nWhen Leshner heard of colleagues' plans to try to legalize same-sex civil marriage, he persuaded Stark to get married so the two could start the case. Leshner considered himself to have been in a common law marriage with Stark for 22 years. After the ruling by a lower Ontario court, Leshner proposed to Stark in front of reporters. The marriage then occurred after the decision \"Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)\" by the Court of Appeal for Ontario deciding homosexuals should be allowed to marry. The Michaels afterwards became well known in their city Toronto, and appeared in the 2003 gay pride parade. The two even made international news. Paul Boddum, a Canadian artist profiled in the \"National Post\" for his work based on dogs, made a portrait called \"Schmikey the Schnauzer\" for Leshner and Stark as a wedding present. The \"National Post\" said this was \"Boddum's most famous commission to date.\"\n\n\"Time\" selected the couple as Newsmakers of the Year as an emblem of \"the year that Canada rethought what was taboo,\" referring to other events such as the loosening of marijuana laws. Leshner replied that \"I really feel like we're Canada's new Mary Pickford... we are Canada's sweethearts... What better human rights story to send around the world that says Canada loves the Michaels, and for the rest of the world to wonder, what on earth is going on in Canada?\" However, some Canadians have been critical of Leshner and Stark, and wrote to newspapers calling them a \"sick aberration,\" while other Canadians did defend them. One paper called this an \"apt reflection of public opinion polls\" indicating Canadians were divided on whether same-sex marriage should be allowed.\n\n\"The Globe and Mail\", in choosing the \"Nation Builders of the year,\" did not select Leshner and Stark. However, they did select the judges involved in the case, namely Chief Justice Roy McMurtry, Eileen Gillese and James MacPherson.\n\nIn 2003, Bishop Jean-Louis Plouffe argued that future-Prime Minister Paul Martin would not be truly Catholic if his government recognized same-sex marriage. At around the same time, Bishop Fred Henry said then-Prime Minister Jean Chrétien may go to hell for recognizing such marriages. Leshner responded to these arguments, which he called \"religious intolerance,\" by saying \"I think the bishop has eaten too much mad cow... The Charter of Rights trumps the Bible.\" In 2004, Leshner wrote a column in the \"Toronto Star\" speaking out against Conservative leader Stephen Harper in the 2004 federal election. Leshner expressed fear that Harper would use the notwithstanding clause to overrule gay rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Leshner said that \"I am beginning to feel like a Jew in Germany in the early 1930s.\"\n\nAlso in 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada listed Leshner and Stark among the intervenors in the case \"Re Same-Sex Marriage\", which found that the federal government could establish same-sex marriage. Following the decision, the press noted Leshner and Stark took part in celebrations. Leshner publicly commented in reference to Alberta Premier Ralph Klein, who Leshner perceived as having been defeated by the ruling, \"Ralph, I'm 56-years-old and I can now say: 'Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-na-na.'\"\n\n\n"}

Grant as commanding general, 1865–1869\n\nAfter the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant spent four years as head of the United States Army in peacetime. With his defeat of Robert E. Lee and the Confederacy, Grant was the most popular man in the country. As the Civil War ended Grant turned his attention to the Plains in the American West where there was numerous conflicts between white settlers, railroads, and Native Americans that resulted in wars between the Natives and the U.S. military. While the attempted Fenian invasion of Canada and French intervention in Mexico took some of his time, Grant's biggest focus was on Reconstruction of the defeated Southern states. Grant found himself caught between President Andrew Johnson, who wanted leniency to the South and a continuation of the social structure there, and the Radical Republicans in Congress, who wanted harsher punishment to rebel leaders and more government assistance to the freed slaves. Grant preserved his popularity and authority throughout the crisis that culminated in Johnson's impeachment. In 1868, the Republicans nominated Grant for president, and he won easily over his Democratic challenger.\n\nIn May 1865, the Union League of Philadelphia purchased the Grants a house in that city, but Grant's work was in Washington. He attempted to commute for a time and return on the weekends, but he and Julia decided to move to Washington. They secured a place in Georgetown Heights, while Grant instructed Elihu Washburne that, politically, his legal residence remained in Galena, Illinois. In the spring of 1865, Grant made an appearance at Cooper Union in New York; the \"New York Times\" described the reception for the war hero: \"...the enhanced and bewildered multitude trembled with extraordinary delight.\" Further travels that summer, with repeated enthusiastic receptions, took the Grants to Albany and back to Galena and throughout Illinois and Ohio. On July 25, 1866, Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of General of the Army of the United States.\n\nGrant was the most popular man in the country. When Johnson was at loggerheads with the Congress over Reconstruction, he took his case to the people with his infamous \"swing around the circle\" throughout the country and he sought to capitalize on Grant's popularity by having Grant travel with him. Grant, wishing to appear loyal, agreed to accompany Johnson; however he confided in his wife that he thought Johnson's speeches were a \"national disgrace\". Grant continued his efforts to appear loyal while not alienating Republican legislators essential to his future. At the same time, Johnson also suspected Grant to be a potential candidate in the 1868 presidential election, and decided to replace Secretary of War Stanton with Grant or Sherman. Grant discussed the matter with Sherman and initially convinced him to avoid the politically troubled president.\n\nJohnson sent Grant on a fact-finding tour of the South after which he filed a report recommending continuation of the Freedmen's Bureau but opposed use of black troops in garrisons which were still needed in the South for protection of both races. He also warned of threats by disaffected poor people, black and white, and recommended that local decision making be entrusted only to \"thinking men\", by which he was thought to have meant, men of property. In this respect, Grant's initial Reconstruction policy aligned with Johnson's policy of pardoning established southern leaders and restoring them to their positions of power. He joined Johnson in arguing that Congress should allow congressional representatives from the South to be seated.\n\nGrant, as commanding general, immediately had to contend with Maximilian of Mexico and the French army which had taken over Mexico under the authority of Napoleon III. Most Americans felt this to be a violation of the Monroe Doctrine. Johnson told Grant to put military pressure on the French to leave Mexico by sending 50,000 troops to the Texas border under Sheridan. Grant told Sheridan to do whatever it took to get Maximilian to abdicate and the French Army to leave Mexico. Sheridan sent Benito Juárez, the ousted leader of Mexico, 60,000 US rifles to aid in an effort to defeat Maximilian. By 1866, the French Army completely withdrew from Mexico; Maximilian was executed by Juárez in 1867. In a cabinet meeting, Johnson suggested Grant be assigned to the Mexican frontier as a way of removing him from the political mainstream. Grant immediately recognized the nature of this proposal, and refused. As a compromise Grant sent Sherman (now promoted to Lieutenant General) in his place.\n\nAfter the Civil War, thousands of Irish veterans joined the Fenian Brotherhood with the intention of invading and holding Canada hostage in exchange for Irish independence. In June 1866, Johnson sent Grant to Buffalo, New York, to assess the situation. He ordered the Canada–US border closed to prevent Fenian soldiers from crossing over at Fort Erie and that more weapons be confiscated. In June 1866, the United States Army arrested 700 Fenian troops at Buffalo and the Fenians gave up on their attempt to invade Canada.\n\nGrant, as commanding general, inherited the \"Indian Wars\" in the western frontiers, especially the Plains, as the United States continued westward expansion. After the Civil War ended in 1865, Grant turned his attention to the neglected American western frontier. One of these Plains wars, known as Red Cloud's War, starting in July 1866, was led by Sioux Chief Red Cloud. To end hostilities, Grant ordered forts on the Powder River to be abandoned and for General William T. Sherman to make a peace treaty with the Sioux. As a result, Red Cloud signed the Fort Laramie Treaty in 1868 successfully negotiated by Sherman. \n\nIn November 1865, Johnson sent Grant on a fact-finding mission to the South. Grant recommended continuation of a reformed Freedmen's Bureau, which Johnson opposed, but advised against the use of black troops in garrisons, which he believed encouraged an alternative to farm labor. Grant did not believe the people of the South were ready for self-rule, and that both whites and blacks in the South required protection by the federal government. Concerned four years of war led to a diminished respect for civil authorities, Grant concluded the Army should continue their presence to maintain order. He also warned of threats by disaffected poor people, black and white, and recommended that local decision-making be entrusted only to \"thinking men of the South\" (i.e., white men of property). In this respect, Grant's opinion on Reconstruction aligned with Johnson's policy of restoring former Confederates to their positions of power, arguing that Congress should allow representatives from the South to take their seats. Grant believed that former Confederates should be reenlisted into the U.S. military. He personally intervened on behalf of Lee, who had been indicted for treason along with other Confederate generals, keeping Lee safe from prosecution, saving the nation from opening up old war wounds. In January 1866, Grant authorized the removal of cases against Union officers, to federal courts and the Freedmen's Bureau. On July 25, 1866, Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of General of the Army of the United States.\n\nIn the elections of 1866, an intraparty fight arose in Maryland, when the mayor of Baltimore, a Radical, appointed Radical police commissioners who would be responsible for managing voter registration. Maryland's governor, a partisan of Johnson, requested that federal troops intervene, which Grant initially considered inappropriate. To provide some manner of response, Grant met as a civilian with the opposing party heads and, with use of the army an implicit threat, was able to facilitate a settlement.\n\nGrant's service as Union General, caused him to join the Republican Party, and forced him to consider African Americans as both humans and soldiers. Johnson, a robust Democrat, sided with white supremacists and openly held racist views, believing blacks were inferior and that the country and government were for \"white men\". Johnson favored a lenient approach to Reconstruction, calling for an immediate return of the former Confederate states into the Union without any guarantee of African American civil rights. The Radical Republican-controlled Congress opposed the idea and refused to admit Congressmen from the former Confederate states. Congress, over Johnson's vetoes, renewed the Freedmen's Bureau and passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. With Johnson at war with Congress, Grant and Johnson found themselves in a quiet conflict over Reconstruction enforcement, while Grant as a soldier was determined to remain loyal to his Commander In Chief. Needing Grant's popularity, Johnson took Grant on his \"Swing Around the Circle\" tour, speaking out against Congressional Reconstruction. Enthusiastic cheering for Grant interrupting Johnson's speeches caused the relationship between Johnson and Grant to cool. Grant believed that Johnson was purposefully agitating conservative opinion to defy Congressional Reconstruction, privately calling Johnson's speeches a \"national disgrace\". Concerned that Johnson's differences with Congress would cause renewed insurrection, Grant ordered Southern arsenals to ship arms north to prevent their capture by Southern state governments. Having returned to Washington, Johnson attempted to send Grant on a mission to Mexico, but Grant refused to go, believing the President did not have authority to send him on a diplomatic mission.\n\nOn March 2, 1867, overriding Johnson's veto, making unprecedented use of the power of the military, Congress passed the first of three Reconstruction Acts, which divided the southern states into five military districts. Transitional state governments in each district were to be led by military governors, to ensure that African Americans' newly granted constitutional and congressional rights were protected. Grant, who was to select the general to govern each district, preferred the will of Congress through the enforcement of congressional Reconstruction, but at the outset opposed the use of the military. Nevertheless, Grant adapted and by complying with the Acts and instructing his subordinates to do likewise, he further alienated Johnson. For example, Grant authorized Sheridan to remove public officials in Louisiana who were against congressional Reconstruction. Sheridan's aggressive methods to register freedmen met with Johnson's disapproval, and the President sought his removal. Grant perceptively stayed the middle course, and recommended a rebuke but not a dismissal. Protecting Grant, Congress passed the Command of the Army Act, attached to an army appropriation bill, preventing his removal or relocation, and forcing Johnson to pass orders through Grant, the general in chief. Republicans gained majorities in all 11 states, and African Americans were elected to Congress and high state offices. Grant hoped that Reconstruction Acts would help pacify the South. The Army conducted new elections for constitutional conventions in the ex-Confederate states. They registered blacks to vote and in many places prevented from voting white men who had supported the Confederacy, as set out in the disenfranchisement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Throughout the Reconstruction period, more than 1,500 African Americans were elected to political office, while Grant and the military protected their rights initially by overturning the black codes in 1867. Congressional Reconstruction finally ended with the Compromise of 1877 and the complete withdrawal of military troops from the southern states.\n\nJohnson and Grants differing civilian and military backgrounds would cause a collision course over policy. On August 12, 1867, during a Senate recess, President Johnson suspended Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Lincoln appointee who sympathized with Congressional Reconstruction. Grant, himself, respected Stanton and sided with him on Reconstruction while both shared a dismay for Johnson. To keep Grant under control as a potential political rival, Johnson asked him to take the post. Grant recommended against the move, in light of the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval for cabinet removals. Johnson believed the Act did not apply to officers appointed by the previous president and forced the issue by making Grant an interim appointee on the same day. Grant agreed to accept the post temporarily, and Stanton vacated the office until the Senate reconvened.\n\nOn January 10, 1868, the Senate Committee on Military Affairs voted to recommend reinstatement of Stanton to office. The following day, Grant consulted with his staff and rereading the Tenure of Office Act, he learned that if he kept the office he would be subject to a $10,000 fine and a five-year prison term. Grant hurried to the White House and told Johnson he was not going to break federal law. Johnson told Grant he would pay the fine and go to prison in Grant's place, but Grant found Johnson's answer preposterous. On Monday, January 13, the Senate voted to reinstate Stanton to office 35 to 6. The following morning, Grant locked up his War Department office and gave the key to Assistant Adjutant General Edward D. Townsend. One hour later, when Stanton arrived at the War Department office, Townsend gave Stanton the key, witnessed by welcoming onlookers.\n\nThis incurred Johnson's wrath; at a cabinet meeting immediately afterward, Johnson accused Grant of breaking his promise to remain Secretary of War. Grant disputed that he had ever made such a promise although cabinet members later testified he had done so. Newspapers friendly to Johnson published a series of articles to discredit Grant over returning the War Department to Stanton, stating that Grant had been deceptive in the matter. This public insult infuriated Grant, and he defended himself in an angry letter to Johnson, after which the two men were confirmed foes. When Grant's statement became public, it increased his popularity among Radical Republicans and he emerged from the controversy unscathed. Although Grant favored Johnson's impeachment, he took no active role in the impeachment proceedings, which were fueled in part by Johnson's removal of Stanton. Johnson barely survived, and none of the other Republican leaders directly involved benefited politically in their unsuccessful attempt to remove the president.\n\nGrant's curt response to Johnson in the Stanton matter increased his popularity with the Radical Republicans. John Weiss Forney, editor of the \"Washington Daily Chronicle\", who had paved the way for previous presidential nominations, took up the effort for Grant's nomination, by first inquiring with Brig. Gen. John Aaron Rawlins, a Grant confidant, about Grant's interest in the presidency. Rawlins responded that while Grant was a loyal member of the Republican Party, he would be unable to serve as president for financial reasons, since he would lose his lifetime military pension upon ascendancy to the White House, and the presidency did not provide any such income benefit. By becoming President under current terms, Grant would at best leave the office at age 56 with no income, assuming he served two terms. Rawlins hoped Forney could facilitate a legislative change to solve the problem. The ultimate answer was that this could not be changed. Forney forged ahead with an editorial reviewing Grant's record with the recommendation for his nomination; Grant personally approved the writing before publication. By reviewing the article, though limited to the accuracy of his record, Grant implicitly opened the door for the nomination despite the precarious financial prospects in his future.\n\nThe Republicans chose Grant as their presidential candidate on the first ballot at the 1868 Republican National Convention in Chicago; he faced no significant opposition. The Republicans kept the name \"Union\" on their ticket as had been done earlier at their 1864 convention. Grant received all 650 votes from delegates, with no other candidate being nominated, and upon the announcement was welcomed with a \"frenzied enthusiasm\". In his letter of acceptance, Grant concluded with \"Let us have peace\", which became his campaign slogan. For vice president, the delegates nominated House Speaker Schuyler Colfax. In June, Grant traveled to St. Louis, having gained possession of his father-in-law's plantation, and an additional 280 acres of Dent land, he had twelve slave cabins demolished, to banish the vestiges of slavery. As was common practice at the time, Grant remained at home in Galena during the campaign, and left most of the active campaigning and speaking on his behalf to his campaign manager William E. Chandler and others.\n\nThe Democrats nominated former New York Governor Horatio Seymour. Their campaign focused mainly on ending Reconstruction and returning control of the South to the white planter class, which alienated many War Democrats in the North. The Democrats attacked Republicans' support of African American rights while deriding Grant, calling him captain of the \"Black Marines\". Democratic orators over and over proclaimed Grant was a drunkard. Grant himself did not take to the stump, allowing Republican spokesmen to identify him with patriotism and with grief for Lincoln's martyrdom.\n\nGrant's 1862 General Order No. 11 and antisemitism became an issue during the presidential campaign. In a letter, published after the election, Grant sought to unequivocally distance himself from General Order No. 11. Grant repudiated his order, saying \"I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit.\" As was expected at the time, Grant returned to his home state and left the active campaigning to his campaign manager, William E. Chandler, and others. The Republican campaign focused on continuing Reconstruction and restoring the public credit. \n\nGrant won the election by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an electoral college landslide, of 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant, at the age of 46 became the youngest president on record. His election was a triumph of principles that included sound money, efficient government, and the restoration of Southern reconstructed states. When he assumed the presidency, Grant had never before held elected office and, at the age of 46, was the youngest person yet elected president. Grant was the first president to be elected after the nation had outlawed slavery and granted citizenship to former slaves. Implementation of these new rights was slow to come; in the 1868 election, the black vote counted in only 16 of the 37 states, nearly all in the South. Grant lost Louisiana and Georgia primarily due to Ku Klux Klan violence against African American voters.\n\n\n"}
