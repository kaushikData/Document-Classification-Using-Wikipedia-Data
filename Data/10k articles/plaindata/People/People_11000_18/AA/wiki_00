She first performed on-stage at the Capitol Theatre at 7. At the time, she had already sung on-air with the CHRC radio station and was a real phenomenon in the whole city.\n\nAt 13 she moved to the Théâtre National, on Montreal's Saint Catherine Street. Under the direction of Rose Ouellette, she learned acting and singing during a 75-week engagement. She continued her career in the Montreal cabarets, making radio appearances. For a time during the war, she also hosted a French radio show named \"Tambour battant\" (\"Rumbling drum\"). Touring Canadian military bases propelled her career across Canada.\n\nDuring the 1940s, she started producing 78s and she became renowned far beyond Canada. She captured popular imagination with Latin titles like \"Besame Mucho\" and \"Tico tico\", after translating herself the Spanish or Brazilian songs into French. She sang in chic New York City cabarets by the mid forties and in 1947, she travelled to England where she made an appearance on the first regular BBC television programme.\n\nIn 1948, while traveling by car to Hollywood, she was injured in an accident, and entered a period of depression. After a series of unfortunate diagnoses, and a failed romance, she suffered a mental breakdown and was interned for several years in a Quebec City asylum. She was at some point subjected to a lobotomy against her will. She credited the operation with her recovery:\n\n\"Je me réveillai guérie et j'ai compris plus tard que j'avais été un des rares cas réussis de lobotomie\" (I woke up better and later understood that I was one of the rare lobotomy success stories). In 1952, she was released. The same year, she came back on stage at the Casa Loma and the Montmartre, but her efforts were impeded by taboos about mental problems and she never regained the same level of popularity.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Alys returned into the public eye after the massive success she had with a song written for her by Alain Morisod (\"Laissez-moi encore chanter\"). Books, theses, plays and television series were written about her. A movie was released in December 2004: \"Alys Robi: Ma vie en cinémascope\" (\"Alys Robi: My Life in Cinemascope\"), titled \"Bittersweet Memories\" in English.\n\nRobitaille has published two autobiographies: \"Ma carrière, ma vie\" (\"My Career, My Life\", 1980) and \"Un long cri dans la nuit: Cinq Années à l'Asile\" (\"A Long Cry in the Night: Five Years in the Asylum\", 1990). The last autobiography title comes from the song \"Un long cri dans la nuit\", written and composed for Lady Alys by the songwriter Christine Charbonneau in 1989.\n\nSeveral of Robi's songs have been used for commercial ads. Sico, notably, played on the similarity between its brand name and the title of \"Tico Tico\" to produce a very catchy campaign based on a spoof of the song.\n\nRobitaille died in the Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, at the age of 88, on May 28, 2011.\n\n\nCompilations :\n\n\n"}

Aligned with the Tea Party movement, he succeeded fellow Republican Bob Deuell, whom he unseated by three hundred votes in the Republican runoff election held on May 27, 2014.\n\nHall graduated in 1960 with honors from George D. Chamberlain High School in Tampa, Florida. He is an Eagle Scout. In 1964, Hall received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina. At The Citadel, he was cited in \"Who's Who in American Colleges and Universities\". Hall was a captain in the United States Air Force. From 1984 to 2013, he operated a business, Professional Proposal Management, Inc., which assisted companies in obtaining government contracts.\n\nHall's run against incumbent State Senator Bob Deuell was his second run for public office. Hall had previously filed and campaigned for the same seat in 2012, but was subsequently disqualified due to failure to meet constitutional residency requirements.\n\nHall received endorsements from various conservative individuals and organizations including former Texas Republican State Chairman Cathie Adams, who praised Hall's commitment. Hall unseated Deuell in a runoff election, 18,230 votes (50.4 percent) to 17,930 (49.6 percent).\n\nDeuell had led a three-candidate field in the primary on March 4, with 23,847 votes (48.5 percent). Because he fell short of a majority, he was placed in the runoff with the number-two candidate, Bob Hall, who in the primary polled 19,085 votes (38.8 percent). The remaining 6,240 votes (12.7 percent) went to a third candidate, Mark Thompson. With his nomination in hand, Hall defeated Libertarian Party nominee, Don Bates, in the November 4 general election.\n\nIn the 2018 Republican primary, Hall was challenged by state representative Cindy Burkett, who ran as a politically moderate alternative to him. Hall defeated her in the March 6, 2018, primary election.\n\nHall consistently votes against unfunded mandates on local public schools. He supported numerous pieces of legislation regarding unfunded mandates in education including SB 1068, which amends Chapter 38.101 of the Education Code so that an assessment of the physical fitness of a student may only be done at the request of the student's parents, and SB 1309, which removes all mandates for teacher training and student instruction on internet safety, teen dating violence, bullying, parenting and paternity, child abuse, and bus safety.\n\nDuring his tenure as a Senator, Hall has consistently supported anti-abortion legislation. Examples of supported legislation by Hall include SB 10, which created stricter abortion requirements at Health Care Facilities; SB 258, which authorizes burial or cremation of fetal tissue after abortion or miscarriage; and SB 20, which prohibits coverage of abortion from taxpayer funded health insurance plans.\n\nHall has been described as a Second Amendment advocate, regularly voting against restrictions on gun ownership. He voted in favor of HB 910, which authorizes open carry of handguns; SB 16, which reduces the fee for firearm carry licenses; and SB 11, which authorizes concealed carry of firearms on college campuses.\n\nHall has voted on several pieces of property tax reform legislation. SB 1 would require cities and counties to hold an election if they plan to increase their property tax revenues by 6%, regardless of whether they are increasing the actual tax rate or just taking advantage of rising property values. Hall also voted for the 2015 budget bill, which put billions of dollars into property tax relief funds to buy down local property taxes for 2015.\n\nHall won his second state Senate term in the general election held on November 6, 2018. With 152,659 votes (59.4 percent), he defeated the Democrat Kendall Scudder, who finished with 104,528 (40.6 percent).\n\nHall and his wife, the former Sarah Kay Smith, a native of Commerce in Hunt County in East Texas, live in Tailwind Airpark in Edgewood, a community for pilots and aviation enthusiasts which has its own runway and hangars. The couple is Southern Baptist and has three adult sons.\n\n"}
{"id": "22742719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22742719", "title": "Bruce Hood (psychologist)", "text": "Bruce Hood (psychologist)\n\nBruce MacFarlane Hood is a Canadian-born British experimental psychologist who specialises in developmental cognitive neuroscience. He is currently based at the University of Bristol and his major research interests include the cognitive processes behind adult magical thinking.\n\nHood's father was a journalist and of Scottish descent while his mother was an Australian. He moved to Dundee, Scotland, at aged 8, and lived in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada during his childhood. He completed undergraduate studies in psychology, then received a Master of Arts and a Master of Philosophy from the University of Dundee. He received a PhD from University of Cambridge in 1991, studying the visual development of infants. After moving to the US he took a place as a visiting professor at MIT and faculty professor at Harvard University. He is currently a professor at the University of Bristol, where he conducts research at the School of Experimental Psychology and teaches the Developmental Psychology modules.\n\nIn his research, Hood investigates various aspects of cognitive development in children. He is most known for looking at the origins of superstitious beliefs in children. Most notably, his research showed that children inherently prefer 'their' individual objects over duplicated ones, a behaviour which persists into adulthood.\n\nFurther, he investigates how children use the gaze to infer about the mental states of humans they are interacting with. Hood also studies how children form theories, for example about gravity and spatial representations.\n\nHood has been engaging in science outreach since the beginning of his career. In 2006, he appeared on the BBC Radio 4 show \"Material World\" and also presented his research at the British Science Association Science Festival later in the same year. Hood argues that humans evolved to \"detect patterns in the world\" and defines the supersense as the \"inclination to infer that there are hidden forces that create the patterns that we think we detect\".\n\nHe reappeared at the same event three years later in 2009 and published his popular science book \"SuperSense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable\" in the same year. The book tackles how the human brain generates superstitious beliefs.\n\nIn 2011, Hood appeared on BBC Radio 4's \"The Infinite Monkey Cage\" show to talk about the science of superstition and also participated in the live performance event \"Uncaged Monkeys\" in Bristol. Later the same year, he held the prestigious Royal Institution Christmas Lectures titled 'Meet Your Brain'. Organized in three parts, they explored the structure of the brain, how the brain controls behaviours and thoughts and how brains allow humans to function in a social context.\n\nIn 2012, Hood published his second popular science book \"The Self Illusion: Why there is no 'you' inside your head\" (published under the alternative title \"The Self Illusion: How the social brain creates identity\" in America). In this book, he argues that the human sense of self is a construct of the brain which facilitates experiencing and interacting with the world. \"Who we are,\" Hood writes, \"is a story of our self − a constructed narrative that our brain creates\". Bruce uses a \"a distinction that William James drew between the self as \"I\" and \"me.\" Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the \"I\" and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the \"me\" which again is a coherent account of who we think we are based on past experiences, current events and aspirations for the future.\"\n\nIn October 2012, Hood devised the world's largest simultaneous memory experiment for the Society of Biology involving 2000 participants to demonstrate the phenomenon of false memories. This was officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records in 2013.\n\nHood's third popular science book, \"The Domesticated Brain\", was published in 2014 and explores the neuro-cognitive origins and consequences of social behaviour in humans. The book's thesis is that \"over the most recent evolution, the last 20,000 years\", humans have been \"selecting each other for prosocial behaviour and that has changed our brains and the way we've become more codependent\". He presented this topic at The Royal Society of Arts, The Royal Society and the 2014 Cheltenham Science Festival.\n\nHood played a key part in exposing the ADE 651 bogus bomb detector and similar devices in January 2010. He got involved in exposing the scam upon realising that the devices were produced locally in Somerset (UK) and challenged the creator of the devices, Jim McCormick, to demonstrate their validity. Even though McCormick initially agreed to this, the demonstration was then delayed and McCormick later required Hood to sign a non-disclosure statement concerning their meeting. Hood had also contacted the BBC about McCormick and his fraudulent products, which ultimately resulted in the production of a BBC Newsnight documentary about ADE 651 and a related device, the GT200. In this documentary, Hood demonstrates that the perceived effect of the devices can be explained by the ideomotor phenomenon, which had fooled naive users.\n\nContrary to prominent skeptics such as Richard Dawkins, Hood is convinced that superstitious beliefs are inevitable and even beneficial to humans. For instance, he argues that essentialism is beneficial to social interactions, since it allows humans to overcome objectification and attribute uniqueness to other humans. However, Hood clearly differentiates between secular and religious beliefs, where secular supernatural beliefs are universally applicable across cultures and religious beliefs are culturally specific. He also argues that secular superstitious beliefs do predispose humans to religious beliefs.\n\nIn 2015 Hood founded Speakezee, an academic speaking platform which can be used by institutions and organisations to find speakers for their events and vice versa.\n\n\"I got the idea after being invited to give too many talks than I could possibly accept, so this system should make it easier to find others who are just as good\".\n\nSpeakers are able to create profiles detailing their subject expertise and speaking experience. Organisers are then able to find and short list speakers and contact them directly to discuss speaking at their event. It also allows academics to advertise their specialist talks to other academics who organise departmental seminars.\n\n\"At its heart is the desire to help more academics engage with the public and to make it easier for organisers to find relevant experts to talk at their event, whatever the size.\"\n\nA platform that is free to use, Speakezee is currently in its first phase and primarily focused in the UK. More functionality and new features are planned for the future, making it more useful for a wider audience and with a view to ultimately expanding the site's use internationally. Hood hopes \"it will stimulate a café culture of intellectual exchange\".\n\nHe was awarded a Sloan Fellowship in neuroscience in 1997, a Young Investigator Award from the International Society for Infant Studies and the Robert L. Fantz prize in 1999. He was also elected to fellow status by the American Psychological Association and is a fellow of The Society for Biology and The Royal Institution of Great Britain.\n\nHe won the 2011/12 University of Bristol individual engagement award, specifically for his local science engagement activity with the group At-Bristol. In 2013, Hood received the Public Engagement and Media Awards from The British Psychological Society for his commitment to public engagement through public lectures, media appearances, pub events and science festivals.\n\n\n"}

He volunteered for the Spanish Civil War in 1939, but his schizophrenia quickly revealed itself, and he was placed on medical leave after only two months. He was committed to the psychiatric hospital in Verona in 1947 and spent ten years in almost total isolation.\n\nCarlo's life took a turn ten years later, when he and twenty other patients were admitted to the painting atelier created by sculptors Michael Noble and Pino Castagna and psychiatrist Mario Marini. In this atelier, patients were encouraged to paint or sculpt freely.\n\nCompletely engrossed by his work, Carlo drew for eight hours a day with tempera paints and colored pencils. This routine seems to have calmed him considerably; clinical evaluations from this time comment on his good behavior. By 1964, his work had been exhibited, and he had attracted the attention of art historians associated with Jean Dubuffet and the Compagnie de l'Art Brut.\n\nIn 1969, the hospital moved to a new location in Marzana, Italy. Disoriented by the move, Carlo painted much more infrequently until his death in 1974.\n\nHis body of work comprises about nineteen hundred paintings and a few sculptures. The paintings are created on white sheets, and are two-sided from 1962 to 1968. These two-sided works can be seen as continuous, as a single narrative from one side to the other.\n\nHe used pure colors to create narratives that tell the story of his childhood in the country, frequently repeating figures to cover the entire background in \"horror vacui\" style. His human figures are always solid shapes drawn in profile, often with holes to represent eyes or other features.\n"}

Meade, who describes himself as a \"Christian numerologist\", claims to have attended the University of Louisville, where he \"studied astronomy, among other subjects\", but, because his real name is unknown, \"The Washington Post\" reported that the university could not confirm whether he had ever been a student there. He is also a writer, researcher and investigator who has written and self-published at least 13 books. He made appearances and interviews on \"Coast to Coast AM\", \"The Washington Post\", \"Glenn Beck Program\", YouTube with pastor Paul Begley, and the \"Daily Express\". He is best known for making numerous predictions, which have passed, regarding the end times, including that a hidden planet named Nibiru (sometimes known as Planet X) would destroy the Earth.\n\nMeade predicted that planet Nibiru would collide with Earth on September 23, 2017, destroying it. After his prediction failed, he revised the apocalypse to October, where he stated that the seven-year tribulation would possibly start followed by a millennium of peace. In 2018, Meade again made several predictions for that year, for instance, that North Korea becoming a superpower in March 2018 and that Nibiru would destroy the Earth in spring. Meade announced that the apocalypse would begin in March 2018, but he didn't predict the exact date. After March 2018 passed, he moved the apocalypse to April 23, 2018, in which he also predicted the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, and Virgo will signal the rapture, and that Nibiru would destroy the Earth that day. However, before that date he said that reports that he predicted the end on 23 April were \"fake news\", but that the rapture—but not the end of the world—would take place on an unspecified date between May and December 2018.\n\nMeade is best known for using Bible passages and Bible verses regarding his predictions. His September 23 prediction was based on secret codes in the Giza Pyramids in Egypt and revolved around the Woman of the Apocalypse. He used the number 33 for his September 23 prediction, stating that “Jesus lived for 33 years” and that “Elohim is mentioned 33 times in the Bible.” His October 2017 predictions were described on his website Planet X News and his book \"Will Planet X Signal the Rapture?\". His April 23 prediction was based on 12:1-2 in the Book of Revelation and referred to the woman as Virgo and stated the alignment represents \"the Lion of the tribe of Judah\".\n\nMeade was raised as a Catholic and attended the University of Louisville, where he claims to have studied astronomy and other subjects. He also claims to have earned a master's degree in statistics. According to his profile page on his website, he has worked for both the federal government and private industry. He additionally stated that he has written investigative reports on abnormal state administration and executives for Fortune 1000 organizations. It is not known which companies he worked for. On his Google Plus page, he also claims to be an investigative journalist.\n\nIn a September 2017 \"The Washington Post\" article, Meade said that he studied astronomy and that he attended a university in Kentucky but declined to say which campus he attended due to safety concerns. He additionally refused to answer questions concerning which Fortune 1000 organizations he worked for and what he does for a living. When he was asked where he lives, he claimed that he lives in \"the heart of a major disaster\" zone of Hurricane Irma, but did not specify the state or city.\n\nMeade appeared on \"Coast to Coast AM\" with George Noory in January 2017 and was interviewed by the American national television and radio program \"Glenn Beck Program\" in September 2017. In addition to books about Planet X, he has written books related to politics, such as \"The Coming Clinton Economic Collapse\" (2016) and \"The Coup D'état Against President Donald J. Trump\" (2017) .\n\nMeade received extensive media attention following his predictions that Nibiru would destroy Earth on September 23, 2017. He first predicted Nibiru would hit the Earth in October 2017, but moved it forward to September 23. On September 21, an Orange County, California television station accidentally displayed his prediction in an emergency alert, and broadcasting officials stated that the false alert was caused by a glitch from a test by the Emergency Alert System. On September 21, he claimed in a Glenn Beck interview to have seen Nibiru from his house and that other people would see the sign as well. Meade then changed his mind and stated that Nibiru would not collide with Earth on September 23.\n\nAs September 23 passed, however, Meade again revised the apocalypse to October, making new predictions for that month, such as Nibiru eclipsing the sun on October 5 and that several people would levitate into the sky (including current U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence) followed by a nuclear attack by North Korea, China, and Russia on the United States. He predicted other events for that month, such as a series of magnitude 9.8 earthquakes; that the Earth's pole would shift by 30 degrees; that the United States would be split in half; and that Barack Obama would be elected as U.S. President for an illegal third term. He also predicted that the 7-year Great Tribulation would start on October 15 and stated \"[t]hat's when the action starts\", but the month passed, and his predictions were incorrectly predicted. His October 2017 predictions were described in his book \"Will Planet X Signal the Rapture?\".\n\nIn an interview with YouTube pastor Paul Begley, Meade made several predictions for 2018, such as North Korea becoming a world-class superpower in March 2018 and predicting that Nibiru would destroy the Earth in spring. In an article published by \"International Business Times\" on February 15, 2018, Meade announced that the apocalypse would begin in March 2018, but no date was given. He stated that several events in 2018, such as the January 2018 super blue blood moon eclipse, the 2018 Winter Olympics, and Israel's 70-year celebration of independence, were signs of the apocalypse. He called several officials in the United Nations \"crazy people\" after voting against the United States' decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and his prediction came just 42 days before the blood moon eclipse.\n\nAfter March 2018 passed, he changed the apocalypse prediction to April 23, 2018, in which he also predicted the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, and Virgo will signal the rapture, and that Nibiru would destroy the Earth that day. He referred to his prediction as \"end of days convergence\" and that the \"disappearance of the Church will occur\". Meade became the first preacher since William Miller to predict that the world would end on 23 April. On April 19, 2018, he stated that reports saying that he predicted the world would be destroyed on 23 April were \"fake news\", but that the rapture—but not the end of the world—would take place on an unspecified date between May and December 2018. He stated that the rapture would bring in seven years of “tribulation”, followed by 1,000 years of “peace and prosperity”, before the world is destroyed. April 23, 2018 passed without incident and Meade's prediction of a rapture taking place has been labeled by some naysayers as one of the latest “kooky” doomsday calls.\n\nMeade has made similar predictions in 2015 in his book \"Rapture 2015 and Planet X\" and in his 2013 book \"Comet Ison and the Return of Jesus\", in which he stated that Comet Ison is the biblical star Wormwood and that it ties to Nibiru. In September 2017, he also made predictions that North Korea would launch a nuclear attack against Yellowstone Caldera from a used Russian submarine parked off the coast of California, and that the attack would trigger a supervolcano eruption. He believed that there would be flooding similar to the Genesis flood narrative and that only believers would survive. He also believed that Russia would be able to wipe the United States out in less than 30 minutes if a war broke out between the two countries.\n\nMeade has faced criticism from fellow Christians: Ed Stetzer, writing for \"Christianity Today\", stated that \"there is no such thing as a 'Christian numerologist, and described Meade as \"a made-up expert in a made-up field talking about a made-up event.\" Christopher M. Graney, a professor with the Vatican Observatory Foundation, noted that the supposedly unique astronomical event cited by Meade as a harbinger of doom was, in fact, quite common, having occurred four times in the last millennium. His theories were also debunked by NASA and \"Time\" writer Jeff Kluger, with NASA stating that Nibiru does not exist.\n\nAlbert Mohler, the President of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary stated, upon Meade's previous prediction in September 2017, that \"Christians are not called to be the setters of dates and the anticipation of the calendar.\" He went on to criticize Meade's predictions saying that \"this kind of thinking should be an embarrassment to Biblical Christians\". Judi McLeod labeled Meade as a false prophet on her website \"Canada Free Press\" after his prophecies failed to come true. ATLAH World Missionary Church pastor James David Manning has also called Meade a fraud in one of his YouTube videos. Brazilian astronomer Duília de Mello called his predictions and theories rubbish, and said Nibiru would have been seen during the eclipse and that Meade was using calculations based on the Gregorian calendar. British journalist Nick Pope stated that his theory had lack of critical thinking.\n\nMeade has been compared to other failed doomsday preachers, such as Harold Camping and Nostradamus, and his September 23 prediction has been compared to other failed dates, such as the 2012 phenomenon and Y2K fulfilling Christian prophecy. After September 23, 2017 passed, a European mind reader and mentalist with the same name received multiple death threats when news websites linked him to the predictions. The man denied being the doomsday predictor and worked with a legal expert to have the false reports removed. Meade's \"Planet X – The 2017 Arrival\" book also received criticism as nonsense and plagiarism, with only 25% being his own work. On January 25, 2018, his predictions were labeled as \"hype\" by \"The Washington Post\" in a story about the Doomsday Clock.\n\nMeade told \"The Washington Post\" that his September 23, 2017 prediction was based on numerical codes in the Bible. He also based his predictions on what he says are coded messages in the Giza Pyramids of Egypt. The specific focus of his prediction revolved around the Woman of the Apocalypse (referring to Revelation 12), another event that was supposed to take place on September 23 when a certain configuration of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and Virgo would happen. He stated the significant number for his September 23 prediction is the number 33, on the grounds that \"Jesus lived for 33 years\" and \"Elohim, the Canaanite god who was later adopted as the supreme god of ancient Israel, is mentioned 33 times in the Bible\". He stated several events, such as the solar eclipse of 21 August 2017, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and the Mexico earthquakes were a sign that Nibiru would appear on 23 September based on the Bible chapter verse Luke 21:25–26.\n\nMeade's April 23 prediction was based on passage 12:1-2 in the Book of Revelation, which states \"And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed in the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and crying out in the pain and agony of giving birth\". He referred to the woman as Virgo and stated that the alignment represents \"the Lion of the tribe of Judah\". When discussing the 7-year tribulation and rapture, he stated “The Book of Revelation states that men will approach Armageddon on horseback. Nibiru is here and the earth will be prepared for the next event on its calendar. That's all in the Book of Revelation, too.”.\n\n\n\n"}

The younger brother of Serena van der Woodsen, Erik van der Woodsen is not featured in the books very often. A junior at Brown University, Serena has said he has \"at least six or seven different girlfriends he sleeps with routinely.\" On a trip to Sun Valley, Erik and Serena’s best friend Blair Waldorf dated briefly.\n\nVery close to his sister, Erik threw her a giant sweet sixteenth birthday bash and drove her up to Hanover on her first day of school there. Aside from his brief appearances, Erik remained a relatively quiet secondary character throughout the series, however he did have a bigger part in the \"Gossip Girl\" prequel, \"Gossip Girl: It Had to Be You\".\n\nIn contrast to the novels, Eric's character is more complex in the show, showing a mature understanding of family and relationships but faces the same troubles as most teenagers have. Alessandra Stanley of \"The New York Times\" mentions his character's deviation from the novels from \"an object of female lust\" to one of \"...psychotherapy.\" But notes his strong bond with Serena, stating how he \"is misunderstood by all but his caring, if troubled, sister.\" Despite his mature persona, Eric is no stranger to the problems that most teens face as his stay at the Ostroff Center, a rehabilitation facility, is a result of his constant loneliness and his mother's many unstable marriages. Connor Paolo notes that Eric's lack of a father figure contributed to his suicide attempt.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, Eric has been living at the Ostroff Center, a high-class mental facility. Serena frequently visits him after coming back. As well as trying to convince the doctors and her mother Lilly to let him out. They let Eric out temporarily, during the Ivy League Mixer, where he develops a friendship with Jenny Humphrey. After Blair Waldorf humiliates his sister, telling the whole school she was attending the Ostroff Center during her absence having mistakenly seeing photos of Serena entering the center, Eric tells Blair he was the one attending the mental center and shows her the scars on his wrists from his suicide attempt.\n\nAt Blair's annual sleepover, Blair dares Jenny to break into the Ostroff Center and take Eric out for the night. Jenny and Blair succeed and they take him to a bar downtown. Lily is made aware of his disappearance and begins to panic. She quickly informs Rufus, whose son, Dan, is on a date with Serena, after she cannot get hold of her. They contact the couple to make sure Eric is alright and to bring him home. Later, Lily realizes that Eric is ready to come out of the medical center. He is present during Thanksgiving dinner at the Humphrey's apartment when Lily and Rufus reveal they had a previous relationship years ago. Due to his mother's engagement to billionaire Bart Bass, he develops a close friendship with Chuck Bass, whom he soon sees as a brother.\n\nHe tries to warn Jenny about her new boyfriend Asher Hornsby (Jesse Swenson) but she mistakes this for Eric being in love with her. In the same episode, Dan and Georgina Sparks see Asher making out with someone outside of school. The news becomes public on Gossip Girl, and Jenny denies the rumor by saying she lost her virginity to Asher, which Eric knows is untrue. During a dinner with his family, Georgina outs him to get back at Serena. Eric's homosexuality upsets Lily, who blames herself for Eric getting institutionalized. Serena comforts him, and learns that Eric already came out to Chuck before her because he knew Chuck wouldn't judge him. He also explains that he had a relationship with someone while at the Ostroff Center, but now believed that it was over. At Asher and Jenny's party, Eric helps Blair dethrone Jenny by revealing that Asher was indeed gay, and that they were involved. Asher denies this, but Blair sends a Gossip Girl blast with Eric and Asher's emails. He and Lilly later reconcile.\n\nDuring summer 2008, Eric is staying with his sister and grandmother in The Hamptons. He receives a call from Jenny who tells him, she needs help to get in the Vitamin White Party. She apologizes to him about the incident with Asher and they become friends again. Eric introduces Tinsley Mortimer to Jenny to extend her contacts in the fashion industry.\n\nAfter the school year starts, although Serena complains about Lily's new marriage and their new house rules, Eric thinks they should give the marriage a chance. Later, Eric introduces Jonathan Whitney (Matt Doyle) as his new boyfriend. They break up after Bart tells Eric that Jonathan has been cheating on him. Eric lodges Jenny secretly in the Bass-van der Woodsen penthouse and goes with her to make the paperwork to divorce her parents.\n\nEric then discovers that Bart hired his private detective, Andrew Tyler, to do research about his, Lily's, and Serena's past. He discovers that Lily was also institutionalized at a French sanatorium and that she didn't tell him so that she could be strong for him. Bart's actions convince Lily to celebrate Thanksgiving with the Humphreys.\nAfter Bart's death, Eric comes back with Jonathan and tries to convince Chuck to go back to their penthouse. Chuck and Eric officially go from close friends to brothers after Lily adopts her late husband's son.\n\nDuring summer 2009, Eric is in his grandmother's house with Jenny, Dan, and Rufus while Lily is in Montecito taking care of his and Serena's grandmother, CeCe. He observes Jenny's speech to the rest of Constance that end the school hierarchy.\n\nDuring Jenny's gradual transformation as an Upper East Side Queen, he falls victim to Jenny and her cronies when a battle over the steps that Jonathan inadvertently started and ends with Eric being splattered with yogurt. The Halloween party that followed after had Jonathan being egged at the club opening, enraging Eric, who tells Jenny he wants nothing to do with her. Eric sabotages Jenny's Cotillion by falsely sending a text to Graham Collins, the date Jenny wants using her phone which claims that Jonathan will be taking her to Cotillion. He joins forces with Blair, whom Jenny also offends publicly, in making Kira Abernathy, a Constance student whom Jenny regularly ignores, a threat to Jenny's reign as Queen. Blair gives Kira a makeover and Eric blackmails Graham into becoming Kira's escort instead of Jenny. Jenny soon endures public humiliation but manages to gain their respect by taking Nate as her escort for Cotillion. These events cause Jonathan to break up with Eric as he claims Eric has changed now that he's resorted to scheming with Blair. After Cotillion, Jenny leaves with the other Upper East Side Queen Bees and leaves unaware that Eric has been responsible for her public embarrassment.\n\nAt Thanksgiving, Jenny discovers that Eric was the one behind her public embarrassment at Cotillion which sets her getting her revenge on him. Eric teams up with Kira and attempts to ruin Jenny by buying one of his accomplices the same bag as her and have the girls turn against her. This fails as Jenny reveals two identical bags handing them over to his accomplices, falsely apologizing for her actions but claiming that one of the girls whom Erica bought a bag for spoiled her surprise. Eric and Jenny then to a truce after Serena's car accident.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Inglourious Bassterds\" that Eric was in Japan and ends up meeting a potential love-interest named Elliot (Luke Kleintank) during a game of assassin on Nate's birthday. On the day of Blair's maid's, Dorota, wedding, Eric wonders if Elliot is gay and discovers that he has a girlfriend during the wedding reception. Elliot then confides in Eric that he is bisexual, indicating that Eric still has a chance with him when Elliot tells him that his girlfriend left out of jealousy.\n\nEric's relationship with his father, William, is also observed when he coldly rejects him for not being there for him. He informs him that he is gay and had been institutionalized.\n\nHis friendship with Jenny is once again tested when she reveals that she aided his father's escape from the police. He coldly states that no one is forcing Jenny to stay and that she can leave if she wants to. Eric is the first to discover that Jenny lost her virginity to Chuck and tries to comfort a dismayed Jenny, who is sent away to finish high school in Hudson.\n\nIn \"The Undergraduates\", Chuck tries to make amends with Rufus and Eric, by coming to Fashion Week with his new girlfriend, Eva. Eric, however, informs Rufus of Chuck's season 1 assault on Jenny and says that his brother has been given too many chances to redeem himself, signaling the end of their once-close bond.\n\nWhen Jenny returns to the Upper East Side briefly for an interview with Tim Gunn, Eric attempts to help her make a good impression and keep her away from both Chuck and Blair. Later, he and Dan scheme against Blair and Chuck to get Jenny to come back for their parents' anniversary. The plan fails when Blair and Chuck sign a treaty and come to a truce. After Dan steals the treaty from Nate, Eric backs out of the plan. Eric unknowingly leads his parents to Blair's party where Dan's plan is about to go through, thinking Dan had abandoned the plan.\n\nEric is present when Serena is admitted to the Ostroff Center. He is proud of her for going, but does not believe her when she denies overdosing. He is also present when Serena confronts Lily.\n\nPepe angry at his mother for what happened to Ben Donovan and Bass Industries. When man from the Empire calls saying the judge from Ben's case was there, Eric calls Serena, which makes her determined to take Lily down.\n\nIn \"Damien Darko\", it is revealed that Eric and Elliot broke up and he has been lying to his mother about being with Elliot when he has really been with Damien. When Jonathan goes with Eric to the W party, Eric ditches Jonathan to meet up with Damien. However, earlier Ben had seen Eric with Damien and called Serena. When they walk in on Eric and Damien, the two pretend to be couple and Ben lectures Eric about making bad choices. Eric promises not to see Damien anymore. Rufus confronts Eric, asking if he bought drugs from Damien and Eric says he bought some pills, but realizes it was stupid and promises to stop. But while he keeps that promise, when Damien calls Eric after Ben warns him away from Serena's family, Eric agrees to hang out with him.\n\nRufus reveals in the season 5 premiere \"Yes, Then Zero\" that Jenny and Eric have moved to London to attend Saint Martins. During the episode \"Memoirs of an Invisible Dan\", it's mentioned that in Dan's semi-autobiographical novel \"Inside\" Nate and Eric's literary counterparts were meshed together.\n\nEric returns briefly for the series finale.\n\n\"TV Line's\" Michael Ausiello had reported that Connor Paolo had originally been offered to become a series regular for the show's second season but kindly declined. “I’m very happy with my position on the show and I have no interest in changing it,” and that he may not be ready to face the same challenges as his other castmates stating that “Watching Blake [Lively] and Penn [Badgley] and the things they have to deal with as [a full-time cast members]… because they are on the posters and they are the face of the show, is not something I’m totally ready for right now.”\n"}

He played in the NFL for 18 seasons and spent the majority of his career with the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nTarkenton's tenure with the Vikings spanned thirteen non-consecutive seasons, playing with the team for six seasons from 1961 to 1966, then for seven seasons from 1972 to 1978. In between his years in Minnesota, Tarkenton was a member of the New York Giants for five seasons. At the time of his retirement, Tarkenton owned every major quarterback record. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\nIn addition to his football career, Tarkenton served as a commentator on \"Monday Night Football\" and a co-host of \"That's Incredible!\". He also founded Tarkenton Software, a computer-program generator company, and he toured the U.S. promoting CASE (computer-aided software engineering) with Albert F. Case Jr. of Nastec Corporation. Tarkenton Software later merged with KnowledgeWare (with Tarkenton as president), until selling the company to Sterling Software in 1994.\n\nFran Tarkenton was born on February 3, 1940, in Richmond, Virginia. His father, Dallas Tarkenton, was a Methodist minister. Tarkenton went to Athens High School in Athens, Georgia, and later attended the University of Georgia, where he was the quarterback on the Bulldog football team and a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. \n\nUnder Coach Wally Butts and with Tarkenton as quarterback, Georgia won the 1959 Southeastern Conference championship. Tarkenton was a first-team All-SEC selection in both 1959 and 1960.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings drafted Tarkenton in the third round of the 1961 NFL Draft, and he was picked in the fifth round of the 1961 AFL draft by the Boston Patriots. He signed with the Vikings. Tarkenton, 21, played his first National Football League game (and the Vikings' first game) on September 17 against the Chicago Bears coming off the bench to lead the Vikings to a come-from-behind victory by passing for 250 yards and four touchdown passes and running for another as the Vikings defeated the Bears 37–13. He was the only player in NFL history to pass for four touchdowns in his first NFL game, until the feat was repeated by Marcus Mariota in the Tennessee Titans' 2015 season opener versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \n\nHe played for the Vikings from 1961 to 1966. His early years with the team were plagued by the trouble expected for a newly created team, with the Vikings winning a total of 10 games combined in their first three seasons, with Tarkenton winning eight of them. He threw 18 touchdowns and 17 interceptions for 1,997 yards in his first season. He rushed for 308 yards on 56 rushes for five touchdowns. The following year, he threw 22 touchdowns and 25 interceptions for 2,595 yards. He rushed for 361 yards on 41 rushes for two touchdowns.\n\nTarkenton was traded to the New York Giants in 1967, at which time he moved to the New York City suburb of New Rochelle, New York. In the first game of the 1969 season, Tarkenton's Giants played the Vikings. After trailing 23–10 in the fourth quarter, Tarkenton threw two touchdown passes to secure a 24–23 comeback victory over his former team. The 24 points allowed by Minnesota's defense were a season-worst for the unit, one more point than the Vikings allowed in losing Super Bowl IV to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nTarkenton enjoyed his best season with the Giants in 1970. The club overcame an 0-3 start to win nine of 10 and move into position to win the NFC East division championship in week 14. However, New York was routed 31-3 by the Los Angeles Rams at Yankee Stadium, leaving the Giants 9-5, one game behind the division champion Dallas Cowboys and the wild card Detroit Lions. 1970 was the closest the Giants came to making the playoffs during a 17-year drought, spanning the 1964 through 1980 seasons.\n\nTarkenton was traded back to Minnesota in 1972, for three players (Norm Snead, Bob Grim and Vince Clements), plus a first and second round draft choice. He led the Vikings to three National Football Conference championships, but in each instance the Vikings lost the ensuing Super Bowl. In Tarkenton's first Super Bowl appearance his team lost to the Miami Dolphins 24–7 in Houston. It lost the second to the Pittsburgh Steelers 16–6 in New Orleans, and in the last Super Bowl Tarkenton played (and Minnesota's last Super Bowl to date), the Vikings lost to the Oakland Raiders 32–14 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.\n\nIn his 18 NFL seasons, Tarkenton completed 3,686 of 6,467 passes for 47,003 yards and 342 touchdowns, with 266 interceptions, all of which were NFL records at the time of his retirement. Tarkenton's 47,003 career passing yards rank him 8th all time, while his 342 career passing touchdowns is 6th all time in NFL history. He also is 6th on the all-time list of wins by a starting quarterback with 124 regular season victories. He also used his impressive scrambling ability to rack up 3,674 rushing yards and 32 touchdowns on 675 carries. During his career, Tarkenton ran for a touchdown in 15 different seasons, an NFL record among quarterbacks. He ranks fifth in career rushing yards among quarterbacks, behind Randall Cunningham, Steve Young, Michael Vick and Cam Newton. He is also one of two NFL quarterbacks ever to rush for at least 300 yards in seven different seasons; the other is Tobin Rote. When he retired, Tarkenton held NFL career records in pass attempts, completions, yardage, and touchdowns; rushing yards by a quarterback; and wins by a starting quarterback.\n\nThe Vikings finished the 1975 season with an NFC-best 12–2 record and Tarkenton won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award and the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award while capturing All-Pro honors in the process. He was also a second-team All-Pro in 1973 and earned All-NFC selections in 1972 and 1976. He was named second-team All-NFC in 1970 and 1974. Tarkenton was selected to play in nine Pro Bowls.\n\nTarkenton was indecisive on his retirement during the last seven years of his playing career.\n\nDespite not winning a Super Bowl, he won six playoff games, and in 1999 he was ranked #59 on \"The Sporting News\" list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.\n\nTarkenton was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1977, the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986, the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987, and the Athens, Georgia Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nA biography of Tarkenton titled \"Better Scramble than Lose\" was published in 1969. This followed Tarkenton's 1967 autobiography \"No Time for Losing\" and preceded by several years his 1977 autobiography \"Tarkenton\" co-written with Jim Klobuchar. The autobiographies chronicle not only his football career but also his personal evolution from his early football days as a preacher's son. Tarkenton co-wrote with Brock Yates a book in 1971 titled \"Broken Patterns: The Education of a Quarterback\", a chronicle of the 1970 New York Giants season.\n\nIn 1986, Tarkenton, with author Herb Resincow, wrote a novel titled \"Murder at the Super Bowl\", the whodunit story of a football coach killed just before his team is to participate in the championship game.\n\nTarkenton wrote the self-help, motivational books \"Playing to Win\" in 1984, and \"How to Motivate People: The Team Strategy for Success\" in 1986. He also wrote the motivational self-help business book titled \"What Losing Taught Me About Winning\", and \"Every Day is Game Day\". In 1987, Tarkenton hosted a \"Think and Grow Rich\" TV infomercial that sold the book with an audio cassette version (the audio cassettes contained an introduction and conclusion by Tarkenton).\n\nMark McCormack helped Tarkenton invest, making him wealthy enough to \"retire this week if [he] wanted to\", as \"New York\" magazine wrote in 1971. Tarkenton was a pioneer in computer software, and founder of Tarkenton Software, a program generator company. He toured the United States promoting CASE or \"computer-aided software engineering\" with Albert F. Case, Jr. of Nastec Corporation, but ultimately merged his software firm with James Martin's KnowledgeWare, of which Tarkenton was president until selling the company to Sterling Software in 1994.\n\nIn 1999, Tarkenton was fined by federal regulators as part of a securities fraud sweep. According to the \"LA Times\", \"In Tarkenton's case, the Hall of Fame quarterback and 10 other former executives of his computer software and consulting firm, KnowledgeWare Inc., were accused of inflating by millions of dollars the company's earnings in reports for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1994. The former Minnesota Vikings quarterback agreed to pay a $100,000 fine and $54,187 in restitution. He did not admit any wrongdoing\".\n\nSince then, Tarkenton has been promoting various products and services including Tony Robbins and 1-800-BAR-NONE. He also founded GoSmallBiz, a small-business consulting website. He also operates an annuity marketing firm called Tarkenton Financial.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Tarkenton gave a speech endorsing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41971260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41971260", "title": "Harry Maitey", "text": "Harry Maitey\n\nThe name Harry Maitey was given by Germans to a native Hawaiian (April 23, 1807 – February 26, 1872), who was the first Hawaiian in Prussia, Germany. He married Dorothea Charlotte Becker from Stolpe on August 28, 1833. Their son Heinrich Wilhelm Otto (born December 2, 1837) and his younger sister Friederike Wilhelmine (born in 1846) died as infants, while their second son Heinrich Wilhelm Eduard (born December 8, 1839, died 1906) survived his parents. His daughter Martha (born 1869), Maitey's only grandchild attaining adulthood, remained unmarried.\n\nThere is little known about Maitey's life in Hawai‘i. The information about his Hawaiian name \"Kaparena\" seems to have no confirmation from other sources. When the Prussian frigate \"Mentor\" arrived in Honolulu on November 28, 1823, the French whaler \"L'Aigle\" had left the harbour the day before with the Hawaiian king Liholiho and his queen Kamamalu the day before. Chiefs from other islands gathered on Oʻahu while the king was absent, and also the death of Keoua, the governor of Maui, caused an atmosphere of political uneasiness. It is unknown, if this situation urged Maitey to plead to be taken aboard of the \"Mentor\", the first Prussian ship both to circumnavigate the globe as well as visiting Hawai‘i. Inquiries about the Hawaiian teenager confirmed, that he had no relatives, and he was allowed to leave Hawai‘i. The name \"Maitey\" was recorded by the Germans as Henry's (or Harry's) family name, but was obviously derived from the Hawaiian \"maika‘i\" or \"maita‘i\".\n\nDuring the voyage the ownership of the ship was transferred to the \"Seehandlungsgesellschaft\" (Prussian Maritime Enterprise) under the jurisdiction of the Prussian king Frederick William III. Therefore, after the arrival of the \"Mentor\" in Swinemünde on September 14, 1824, the king was informed about the \"Sandwich islander\", and decided on September 27, that the president of the \"Seehandlungsgesellschaft\", Christian Rother, should bring him to Berlin. Maitey stayed in Rother's house there until the king decided on October 15, that he had to be educated in the German language and the principles of Christianity.\n\nMaitey continued to live with the family of president Rother until 1827, when he moved to the \"Erziehungshaus vor dem Halleschen Tor\", a school institution he had attended since 1825. In 1827 Maitey was invited to meet Wilhelm von Humboldt for conversations about the Hawaiian language, the result of which Humboldt presented first in the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1828. Based on these conversations the \"Sandwich-Wörterverzeichnis\" (Sandwich glossary) served as foundation of his research on the Malayo-Polynesian languages and Maitey was Humboldt's most important source for the Hawaiian language.\n\nFrom fall in 1829 he had a Hawaiian companion in the \"Erziehungshaus\" for about eight months, Jony Kahopimeai, who had come to Germany with the Prussian ship \"Princess Louise\". After Maitey started to serve at Peacock Island Jony occasionally visited him, but in February 1831 he became ill, died from pneumonia and was buried on March 2, 1831.\n\nOn April 23, 1830, Maitey was baptized and confirmed. He was given the German names \"Heinrich Wilhelm\" at the christening. In August Maitey was taken over by the royal household and assigned as assistant to the engine master at Peacock Island (German: \"Pfaueninsel\"). He was listed as a \"ward of the king\" and \"assistant to the engine master\". However, it is documented that there was also a suggestion, that Maitey should become the ferryman of Peacock Island, but obviously his final assignments were a much better perspective for him.\n\nIn summer 1834 two Hawaiian geese \"(nēnē)\", which were brought to Germany on the ship \"Princess Louise\" as well, arrived also on the island.\n\nThe engine master Franciscus Joseph Friedrich trained Maitey as wood turner, locksmith, and cabinetmaker.\n\nAfter some difficulties Maitey got the royal marriage consent with help from Christian Rother, and married Dorothea Charlotte Becker on August 25, 1833, in the church of Stolpe. After the wedding the couple moved to Klein-Glienicke, therefore Maitey had to travel to Peacock Island for work. Later he was more and more absent, which created difficulties for his relationship with Friedrich. Finally it was decided, that Maitey was assigned to the royal \"Garten Inspector\" Fintelmann.\n\nWhile working under master Friedrich, Maitey apparently helped him \"building miniature replicas of famous castles and cathedrals\" from ivory and mother-of-pearl. The part of his carving skills seemed to be essential, because it was stated later, that Friedrich did not made the models anymore after Maitey left as his assistant. It is also suggested, that Maitey was the artist who created some yellow room dividers in the castle, which were attributed to Friedrich as well.\n\nLiving in Klein-Glienicke (Kurfürstenstraße 10) for the rest of his live Maitey died of smallpox at his home on February 26, 1872, \"a pensioner of the king, at the age of sixty-four.\" His grave still exists at a small cemetery not far from the church St. Peter and Paul at Nikolskoe near Peacock Island and is also the final resting place of his wife and his in-laws:\n\nMaitey's son Eduard believed, that his father was a Hawaiian prince, which was doubted by Caesar von der Ahé who published articles about Maitey in 1930 and 1933. Von der Ahé mentioned the name \"Kaparena\" as probably Maitey's Hawaiian name, but there are no such records in the Prussian documents. He also referred to files of the former Prussian court when he wrote, that Maitey's father was a soldier in Hawai‘i.\n\nIt is unknown, if Maitey's widow or Eduard had the chance to see King Kalākaua during his visit in Berlin and Potsdam in August, 1881. However, Eduard served as an actuary in Angermünde for some time before he returned to Potsdam for the rest of his life.\n\nMaitey likely understood his relationship to the President of the Seehandlung Christian Rother as the usual adoption in Hawai‘i \"(hānai)\". This also explains the misunderstandings in the years 1829 and 1830, when Maitey hoped in vain to return to Rother's household.\n\nA newspaper report from 1824 shows that Maitey performed a hula in Berlin, which can be identified as a \"hula noho\":\nJohann Gottfried Schadow who was strongly interested in physiognomy drew Maitey in 1824 and noted about his appearance:\n\n"}

{"id": "1194456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1194456", "title": "Jerry Grote", "text": "Jerry Grote\n\nGerald Wayne Grote (born October 6, 1942) is an American former professional baseball player. He played the majority of his Major League Baseball career as a catcher for the New York Mets, catching every inning of the franchise's first two World Series appearances, and would appear in two more World Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was a two-time All-Star for the National League and is regarded as one of the best defensive catchers of his era.\n\nGrote was raised in San Antonio, Texas. When he was ten years old, he and his family were caught in an F-4 tornado. His mother, father and two sisters made it to safety, however, he lost his grandmother in the storm. Grote attended Douglas MacArthur High School, where he played on the baseball team as a pitcher, catcher and third baseman. As a high school pitcher, he threw a no-hitter and a one hitter. Grote played for Trinity University in 1962, and led the Tigers in batting average (.413), home runs (five), RBI (19), runs (29), and hits (31).\n\nAfter one season at Trinity University, Grote was signed as an amateur free agent by the Houston Colt .45s in 1962, and was assigned to play for their minor league affiliate, the San Antonio Bullets. At the age of 20, he made his major league debut with the Colt .45s on September 21, 1963 as a late-inning defensive replacement for John Bateman, and hit a sacrifice fly to score Bob Aspromonte in his only at-bat. For the season he appeared in three games, including on September 27, when every starter in the Colts' line-up was a rookie.\n\nIn 1964, Grote platooned with Bateman behind the plate; however, the Colts also experimented with young catchers Dave Adlesh and John Hoffman, as neither Grote nor Bateman hit for a very high average that season (.181 and .190, respectively). Grote was the Colts' catcher on April 23, when Ken Johnson became the first pitcher in major league history to lose a complete game no-hitter in nine innings.\n\nIn 1965, the newly renamed Houston Astros remained unsettled behind the plate, with former All-Star Gus Triandos and prospect Ron Brand being added to the mix. Grote spent the entire season with Houston's Triple-A Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Oklahoma City 89ers, where he batted .265 with eleven home runs. At the end of the season, he was traded to the New York Mets for pitcher Tom Parsons.\n\nGrote became the starting catcher for the Mets immediately upon his arrival in New York City. Though he batted only .237 with three home runs in , his handling of the Mets' young pitchers and his solid defensive skills were instrumental in helping the Mets avoid 100 losses and a last place finish for the first time in franchise history. Grote earned a reputation with his teammates and opponents as highly competitive, developing the trademark of rolling the ball to the far side of the pitcher's mound (closest to the Mets' dugout) while leaving the field after his pitcher ended an inning with a strikeout. This necessitated the opposing team's pitcher having to walk further to stoop and retrieve the ball.\n\nIn 1968, Grote was hitting over .300 at mid-season and was recognized as one of the top catchers in the National League when he was selected to be the starting catcher in the 1968 All-Star Game. He became only the second Met player in franchise history after Ron Hunt to earn a starting role in an All-Star game. Grote was hitless in two at-bats during the game. He ended the year with a .282 batting average along with three home runs and 31 runs batted in.\n\nThe 1969 season would be a memorable one for Grote and the Mets. The Chicago Cubs had been in first place since the beginning of the season and had a nine-game lead as late as August 15. However, the Cubs began to falter while the Mets continued to play well. When the two teams met for a two-game series on September 8, the Mets won both games to move just a half game behind the Cubs. Aside from calling Tom Seaver's five-hit pitching performance in the second game, Grote drove in the Mets' seventh and final run of the game. The following day, the Mets swept the Montreal Expos in a doubleheader, with Grote catching all 21 innings. Coupled with a Cubs loss, the Mets moved into first place for the first time in their history. The Mets stayed in the lead for the rest of the season, finishing with a 37-11 record in their final 48 games while the Cubs slumped to a 9-17 record in their final 26 games, and clinched the National League Eastern Division title on September 24.\n\nGrote finished the season with a .252 average and produced career-highs with six home runs and 40 runs batted in, but it was his defensive skills that proved most valuable for the Mets. Grote posted a .991 fielding percentage and his 56.3% caught stealing percentage was second-best among National League catchers. He was also given credit for guiding the Mets young pitching staff that led the league in victories and shutouts and finished second in team earned run average.\n\nThe Mets went on to sweep the Atlanta Braves in the 1969 National League Championship Series, but were heavy underdogs heading into the 1969 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. Following a 4-1 loss in the series opener with Cy Young award winner Seaver on the mound, it seemed as if the Mets had little chance against the Orioles. However, the Mets bounced back, winning the next four games to capture their first world championship. Besides catching every inning in the post-season, Grote contributed offensively with a single in Game Two to keep a ninth inning rally alive and Al Weis followed with the game-winning hit. With Game Four tied, Grote doubled to start the tenth inning, then pinch runner Rod Gaspar scored the winning run when an errant throw hit J.C. Martin on the wrist. With Grote calling the pitches, the Mets pitching staff held the Orioles hitters to a .146 batting average during the series.\n\nGrote and the 1969 Mets became an improbable part of baseball history. In their previous seven seasons the Mets had finished in last place five times. Their sudden turn of fortune in 1969 and their subsequent upset victory in the World Series stunned the sports world and became one of the more storied events in baseball lore. The team became known as the \"Miracle Mets\".\n\nGrote continued to provide the Mets with good defense, leading National League catchers in and in putouts and in range factor. In 1972, Grote played in only 64 games due to injuries and in late September he had surgery to remove bone chips from his right elbow.\n\nIn May 1973, Grote broke a bone in his right arm when he was hit by a pitch and went on the disabled list for two months. When he returned in mid-July, the Mets began winning, climbing from last place on August 30 to win the National League Eastern Division pennant. They then proceeded to defeat the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds in the 1973 National League Championship Series. In the World Series, the Mets took the Oakland Athletics to the seventh and final game, before they were defeated. As he had in 1969, Grote caught every inning of every post-season game for the Mets in . Looking back on his two pennant-winning seasons with the Mets, Grote said, \"It (the 1969 season) was no miracle. Now, '73 was a miracle.\"\n\nIn , Grote was batting .287 with four home runs and 27 runs batted in to earn his second All-Star selection, however, injuries were beginning to take their toll and he split the catching duties with Duffy Dyer. Grote rebounded in 1975, posting a career-high .295 batting average in 119 games and led all National League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage. At Veterans Stadium on July 4, 1975, Grote stepped in as a pinch hitter against longtime teammate Tug McGraw, who had been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies during the off-season. With the Mets down 3-2, Grote connected for a game winning two run home run.\n\nBy the 1977 season, John Stearns had taken over as the Mets' starting catcher as back injuries continued to plague Grote and in August, after twelve seasons with the Mets, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for two players to be named later.\n\nShortly after joining the Dodgers, Grote struck out in his only career at-bat against former battery-mate Tom Seaver, who was now with the Reds. During his two seasons with the Dodgers, he played part-time as a backup to Steve Yeager and appeared in two World Series against the New York Yankees. He retired from professional baseball after the season, only to be lured out of retirement in 1981 by the Kansas City Royals, who were experiencing a shortage of catchers. On June 3, , at the age of 38, Grote went 3 for 4 with a grand slam home run, a double, and a stolen base, driving in a team-record seven runs. After another short stint with the Dodgers, he retired for good after the season.\n\nIn a sixteen-year major league career, Grote played in 1,421 games, accumulating 1,092 hits in 4,339 at bats for a .252 career batting average along with 39 home runs and 404 runs batted in. He ended his career with a .991 fielding percentage, which at the time of his retirement was eighth highest all-time among catchers. On April 22, , Grote set a major league record with 20 putouts in a game when Tom Seaver threw 19 strikeouts against the San Diego Padres. He is the Mets all-time leader in games played as a catcher (1,176). Grote caught 116 shutouts in his career, ranking him 15th all-time among catchers.\n\nGrote called the pitches for some of the most outstanding pitchers of his era, including Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, Tug McGraw, Nolan Ryan, Tommy John, Don Sutton, and Dan Quisenberry. He possessed a strong and accurate throwing arm against opposing baserunners. Hall of Fame inductee Lou Brock found Grote to be one of the most difficult catchers on which to attempt a stolen base, and though Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench was the perennial Gold Glove winner during their careers in the National League together, Bench once said of Grote, \"If Grote and I were on the same team, I would be playing third base.\"\n\n<div align=\"left\">\nAfter his playing career had ended, Grote spent as manager of the Lakeland Tigers and the Birmingham Barons. In , he played for the St. Lucie Legends in the Senior Professional Baseball Association. He was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991, and the New York Mets Hall of Fame in . In , he was inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame. On October 8, 2011, Grote was inducted into the Trinity University Athletic Hall of Fame. After retirement, Grote continued to raise prize Texas longhorns on his ranch near Austin, Texas. He appeared as a Mystery Guest on the television game show \"What's My Line?\".\n\nGrote can be heard as color commentator with Mike Capps on the Round Rock Express (PCL) radio home broadcasts (2010)--and on the Internet on MiLB.com.\n\nGrote and his wife learned Transcendental Meditation in August 1974. Of their practice Grote said, \"it's like an instant seven or eight hours' sleep. … Because of it, my wife and I probably are more in love, closer, and more dependent on each other than we've ever been in 13 years of marriage.\"\n\n"}

The National Slum Dwellers Federation works closely with Mahila Milan, a collective of savings groups formed by homeless women and women living in slums across India, and with SPARC, a Mumbai-based NGO, and together they have been instrumental is supporting tens of thousands of the urban poor access housing and sanitation. He has also worked with the police to set up 'police panchayats' in many of the informal settlements in Mumbai. Here, for the first time, police are assigned to work in these settlements and are supported by a committee of ten residents from the community (three men seven women).\n\nJockin realized that slum dweller organizations had to change their strategy. They had to make governments see them as legitimate citizens with knowledge and capacities to implement solutions. So they sought to work in partnership with government to address their housing problems – and other problems. He often said how can you reduce urban poverty if you do not listen to and work with the urban poor. He built more than 20,000 (toilet) seats in Mumbai alone. He insisted on new standards on redeveloped housing, an increased floor-space-index. Over the years, Arputham has built 30,000 houses in India, and 1,00,000 houses abroad. Funding for his work came from many sources. Thanks to his work, he met both Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela.\n\nHe visited many other countries to encourage and support slum or shack dwellers to organize and to encourage them to take their own initiatives to show government what they are capable of. \nHe resided in Mumbai; his office was in Dharavi. He was the winner of the 2000 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Peace and International Understanding and an honorary Ph.D. from KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, in 2009. In 2011, the Government of India bestowed on him its fourth highest civilian honor, the Padma Shri award.

He became involved in community action within the settlement where he lived and worked, organising efforts to get household waste collected, setting up informal schools for children, and establishing water connections.\n\nWhen the 70,000 people who lived in Janata colony (including him) were threatened with eviction, he helped organize protests and court cases. He was arrested many times, despite Janata colony not being an illegal settlement. He also squatted in the Parliament in Delhi until the then Prime Minister would see him. But in 1976, 70,000 people were evicted, although the community organizations that had emerged meant that they got much better terms than most evictees - land and support for housing in Cheetah Camp.\n\n"}

He lives and works in Santiniketan. He graduated from the Government College of Art & Craft, Kolkata and subsequently at École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris in 1967. He has immense contribution in inspiring young artists of India. Jogen Chowdhury had developed his individual style after his return from Paris. His most famous paintings are in ink, water colour and pastel. He has painted in oil medium as well.\n\nLines and its tactile characteristic to enhance colours is an important material in Indian Art for ages. Jogen Chowdhury himself is a master of lines and he has mastered to make the curves depict the character of his figures. By careful distortion of the form he imparts the air of caricature in his figures, figures of men and women. The figure is always the most important and conveys all the artist has to express. Colour, he uses though, is to provide matter into the form. R. Siva Kumar has lucidly described Jogen's works in the following excerpt:\"The pulse and rhythm of Jogen Chowdhury’s art comes from a filial affinity to nature and milieu. In Chowdhury’s more recent works the sensory experiences of cloth, bolsters, sofas and the human body are cross-projected to produce an uncanny world of tran-substantiated tumescence and flaccidness. Mnemic displacements and personal associations add to the symbolic ambivalence of his motifs, making his images come closer to inexplicable experiences than to explicit signs. In the postures of some figures we feel an animal sentience, in the ripe anatomy of others we savour a fruity succulence. The figures are wrought by a combination of decorative wilfulness and expressive distortion and are imbued with an effusive sensuality. Chowdhury’s art is rich in suggestions; it is to be apprehended without bracketing our fund of knowledge, experience or memories, but also cannot be narrativised without trivialising it, without depleting its sensory particularities.\"\n\nJogen was born in Daharpara Village, a village in the Faridpur district of Bangladesh in 1939. His father Pramatha Nath Chowdhury was a Brahmin zamindar. Jogen received the interest on art from his parents as both his parents were artists.

Just before partition Jogen along with his father came to Calcutta; the rest of the family moved to Calcutta in 1948, after the partition. The family stayed at his uncle's quarter. Here Jogen painted his first painting, on the wall.\n\nIn 1951, Jogen's family moved to Saheednagar Colony, Dhakuria.\n\nJogen was admitted to the Government College of Art & Craft, Kolkata in 1955 wherefrom he graduated by 1960. His first job was as an art teacher in Howrah zilla school.

{"id": "6179294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6179294", "title": "List of Big Brother 7 houseguests (U.S.)", "text": "List of Big Brother 7 houseguests (U.S.)\n\nA total of fourteen HouseGuests entered the house to compete in the All Stars edition of the American reality series \"Big Brother\". This was the first season to feature returning HouseGuests competing for the grand prize, and is one of six seasons to feature previous HouseGuests competing. At least one HouseGuest from each season is featured in the All Stars edition. \"Big Brother 1\" had the lowest number of participants, with only HouseGuest George competing. \"Big Brother 6\" had the highest number of HouseGuests competing this year, with Janelle, Howie, James and Kaysar all returning to compete.\n\nAlison Kemerer Irwin (born August 7, 1980), 37, was the Runner-Up in the fourth edition of \"Big Brother\". She became well known for her manipulative gameplay, as well as the fact that she \"hooked up\" with numerous male HouseGuests to advance herself farther in the house. During the first week in the house, she became a part of the plan to make Jase disagree with Janelle's nominations, thus nominating the two of them. Despite this, Jase and Janelle nominated Alison and Danielle for eviction. Following the nominations, Janelle wanted Alison evicted. Despite HouseGuests Mike and Will campaigning for her to stay, Alison was evicted in an eight to two vote on Day 11. Following her eviction, she was questioned in the studio by host Julie Chen, and her answers helped determine the new Head of Household. She briefly appeared later in the season during the \"Ghost of Seasons past\" competition.\n\nDanielle Reyes (born January 22, 1972), 46 ,was a property manager from Vacaville, California, married with two daughters. Danielle was the Runner-Up in the third edition of \"Big Brother\", losing in a nine to one Jury vote. Danielle is often seen as one of the greatest players to never win the game, a title that led her to seek \"redemption\" for her loss. Danielle was nominated against Alison in the first week, after the two devised a plan to get rid of HouseGuest Janelle. Danielle later survived the eviction, and Alison was evicted. Despite acting as though she had friendships with the members of the \"Season Six alliance\", Danielle was often seen campaigning to get them out. Following Diane's eviction, Danielle formed the \"Legion of Doom\" alliance with Mike, Will and James, with the goal of evicting Janelle from the house. Danielle was the fifth Head of Household of the season, and nominated Janelle and James for eviction. When Janelle won the Power of Veto, Kaysar was nominated in her place. Kaysar was evicted that week. The following week, Janelle became Head of Household and nominated Danielle for eviction. The following day, however, Danielle won her first Power of Veto competition, and saved herself from eviction. Danielle was later nominated in the eighth week by Head of Household Erika. On Day 60, Danielle was evicted in a three to zero vote. She came in 6th place, and voted for Mike to win.\n\nDiane Nicole Henry (born March 1, 1982), 36, is a cocktail waitress from Burlington, Kentucky. She came in 3rd place in the fifth edition of the series. Diane became a fan favorite, and was voted into the house by viewers. Before entering the house, Diane formed the \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" alliance with Jase, keeping it a secret until the finale. She also had a close friendship with Nakomis, who Diane had been aligned with throughout the fifth season. After voting against the majority during the first week, both Diane and Nakomis found themselves nominated in the second week. Nakomis was evicted that week, with Diane surviving the eviction. She was later nominated by Janelle in the fourth week as a replacement nominee for Mike. Diane was ultimately evicted on Day 32 in a seven to one vote. She came in 11th place.\n\nErika Michelle Landin (born December 5, 1969), 48, is a Pilates instructor from Chicago, Illinois. She was originally a contestant on \"Big Brother 4\", coming in fourth place. Since \"Big Brother 4\", there has been a common dislike between her and fellow All-Star Alison Irwin, who was the sole Houseguest responsible for Erika's eviction in that season. In Season 7, Alison was evicted first, and Erika has faced little animosity.\n\nAs a Pilates instructor, she occasionally led Pilates lessons for the houseguests in the backyard of the house. Another contestant, Marcellas, has compared Erika's gameplay to that of Amber Mariano in \"\", as she is playing under the radar. Because Amber went on to win \"Survivor: All-Stars\", Marcellas claimed that Erika should be closely watched. Many houseguests consider her a strong competitor, but she is frequently nominated as a pawn instead of as a target.\n\nErika won Week 2's Power of Veto, but did not use it to save either Diane or Nakomis from the nomination block. On Week 4, Erika was nominated by Janelle as a pawn against Mike. After Diane became the replacement nominee, Erika foiled Diane's plans to sway the houseguests's votes. Erika only received an eviction vote from Will that week. Erika later won Week 6's HoH competition. Unfortunately, the competition was replayed due to technical glitches during the original competition, and Janelle became the new HoH instead. Janelle attacked Erika gameplay as a \"floater\" and nominated her. In the Diary Room, however, Erika claimed to be \"a simple girl from a town called Chill.\" Erika again avoided eviction, after vigorous campaigning for replacement nominee Marcellas' eviction. Immediately afterwards, George won the Head of Household and had to nominate two people on the spot. He chose to nominate Erika and James. James saved himself with the power of Veto and was replaced by Howie. For the third time, Erika survived the eviction by receiving only two out of five votes.\n\nErika finally officially won a Head of Household competition on Week 8. She celebrated wildly upon winning, along with ally Danielle, whom she told was \"so safe.\" Erika's original nomination choices were Janelle and Chicken George, with the intention of removing Janelle. Janelle won the Veto yet again, however, and Erika found herself in a difficult position. Her \"showmance\" Boogie urged her to nominate Danielle, and was strongly set against Will's elimination. Despite being confused with Mike's loyalties, Erika chose to nominate Danielle, who claimed it was a \"betrayal.\" The controversial decision led to much animosity between the two women, and Danielle was evicted.\n\nImmediately following that, the Houseguests learned another contestant would be gone within the next forty-five minutes. After a quick Head of Household competition, Janelle was crowned the HoH. She nominated Erika and George, with the intention of eliminating Erika, but Erika won the Power of Veto. Mike took Erika's place, but George was evicted 2-0.\n\nAfter Mike won the Head of Household, and Janelle the Power of Veto it would be between Erika and Will to be evicted. Despite Will's wrap on Janelle throughout the game, Erika decided to reveal all to Janelle in hopes of saving herself. This led to the two of them finally figuring out what Chilltown was doing and they formed a final two alliance. Erika survived the eviction again and Will was out.\n\nAfter Erika won part one and Mike won part two, she decided to reaffirm her alliance with him. She still liked him, although he had called her a \"ho\" in the Diary Room following his friend Will's eviction. Mike won the final part of the Head of Household competition and evicted Janelle. In the final two many jury members disliked Erika's gameplay and felt Mike played better. She lost the final vote 6-1, only receiving the vote of Marcellas.\n\nGeorge Allen Boswell, also known as \"Chicken George,\" was originally a contestant on \"Big Brother 1\". He was the only Houseguest from that season eligible to enter the All-Star house. This is likely in part to the fact that Big Brother 1 was a much different game than the seasons that followed. As well, winner Eddie McGee and fan favorite Brittany Petros were both approached and declined the invitation to return. \"Big Brother 1\" had lower ratings and played more like the international versions of Big Brother. Despite this, George was chosen to enter the All-Star house by the producers. He became the eighth male to enter the house, leaving the gender division in the house at 8-6 instead of the usual even split.\n\nIn the early days of the game, George was often ridiculed and dismissed as a minor resident of the house. As time passed, however, he began gaining recognition as a potential threat due to his under-the-radar personality. Some houseguests have compared him to Michael \"Cowboy\" Ellis, who many believed was taken to the final two of Season 5 because he was unlikely to win. On Week 3, James nominated George for eviction alongside Will, stating that having caught George eavesdropping on his conversations. George was unhappy about his nomination and began harbor some animosity for James. Seemingly against all odds, George won the Power of Veto. On the downside, he won the veto by choosing to eat only \"slop\" for the remainder of his time in the house. George made a very touching speech at the Veto Ceremony, claiming to feel honored to play with each and every Houseguest, and then he vetoed his own nomination. He was allowed to eat regular food for a week when Marcellas gave him the slop pass he won during Week 5's HOH competition. During Week 6, Head of Household Janelle was angry at Chicken George for having sworn on his kids that he wouldn't vote to evict Kaysar yet doing so anyway. However, George actually promised no such thing—he actually told Kaysar he was unsure what he was going to do. Despite intentions to name George as a replacement nominee after Danielle Reyes won the Power of Veto, she chose instead to nominate Marcellas Reynolds, giving George safety for another week.\n\nAt the beginning of Week 7 on Day 46, George won the Head of Household competition in a tie-breaker against Danielle. As part of a surprise double-eviction week, he was forced to immediately nominate two housemate for eviction live. He nominated James and Erika. However, James won the veto and George then nominated Howie.\n\nAt the beginning of Week Eight, George was nominated alongside Janelle by Erika. Janelle won the veto and removed herself from the block, causing Head of Household Erika to nominate Danielle. Danielle Reyes was evicted the following Thursday, day 60. \nIn addition, Day 60 included \"Big Brother Overdrive\", a game element where a full week's worth of play took place in an hour. George Boswell was nominated alongside Erika, but Erika won the Power of Veto. She was replaced with Mike, and George was then evicted by a 2-0 vote. Once evicted, George received a bucket of classic KFC chicken from a man dressed as Colonel Sanders, and was sent to the jury house.\n\nHowie Gordon (born January 7, 1971), 47, is one of many All-Star contestants to originate from \"Big Brother 6\". He placed fifth that season and was the last remaining male contestant. Known for his crazy and funny antics, Howie was typically perceived as a light-hearted goofball. There were times throughout the season, however, when Howie became extremely upset and uncharacteristically serious. One such occasion is his infamous \"Busto\" rant, in which he claimed fellow contestant April was thoroughly useless. Despite this, his popularity rating was consistently very high throughout the season.\n\nDuring the first days in the All-Stars house, Howie very enthusiastically made mention of the wonderful variety of \"boobies\" in the house. Howie's strategy has been very similar to his original strategy in Big Brother 6. Always joking, he has once again become known as the goofball, and is usually viewed in a favorable light. However, Howie did run into some conflict with Will, as the two constantly seemed to insult one another - sometimes in joking spirit, other times not. Julie discussed this on the first eviction night, and it hasn't been mentioned since. Howie largely considers himself a \"Jedi,\" and he is usually seen with a lightsaber. This season, he took Chicken George under his wing as a \"Jedi Apprentice.\" Howie sparked mild controversy during Week 6's Head of Household competition. During the competition, Howie's cubicle did not light up during one of the questions when he pressed his buzzer, leading host Julie Chen to believe that Howie had not answered the question. Howie left in protest that he did hit the button but his box didn't flash due to technical errors. This problem, along with other technical problems, led to a re-do competition, which was won by Howie's ally, Janelle. The following week, George named Howie as a replacement nominee when James saved himself with the Power of Veto. During that night's eviction, Howie received three votes to Erika's two. Howie's exit from the Big Brother house was one of the most dramatic to date, where he physically confronted Boogie on the way out the door. He became the second member of the All-Stars jury. Upon arrival at the sequester house, Howie told fellow evictee Marcellas, \"I couldn't beat a chicken\".\n\nJames Allen Rhine (born December 6, 1975), 42, was a contestant from \"Big Brother 6\", coming in seventh place overall. During that season, he was constantly targeted but proved quite difficult to eliminate, as he won more Veto challenges than any other Houseguest in Big Brother US history. James was often targeted because he was perceived as deceptive. James was finally evicted when the two opposing alliances in the house - between whom James had meticulously played the entire game - came together to eliminate him.\n\nAlthough he entered the house as part of the Season Six alliance, he did not have much trust that they wouldn't turn on him again. He decided to try protecting Diane and Danielle as well. On Week 3, James won the HoH Competition. His original nominations were Will and George, but when George vetoed his own nomination, James made the controversial decision to put Jase up as a replacement nominee for floating between the two early alliances. In Week 4, after Janelle named Diane as the replacement nominee instead of Will, James said, \"As far as the BB6 alliance goes, I'm done,\" and also, \"I'm going to do whatever it takes to make sure Janelle gets screwed.\" Although James openly remained a member of his originally alliance, he secretly aligned himself with Danielle as well as Will and Mike, forming the Legion of Doom alliance. During the next week's Head of Household competition, James won the power to nullify an eviction vote and Danielle became the Head of Household. She nominated James as a pawn alongside Janelle. Danielle believed James would be able to beat Janelle in the Veto competition. Janelle won instead and saved herself. Danielle chose to nominate Kaysar in her place. Before the eviction, James nullified Janelle's eviction vote, as he knew it would be against him. Kaysar was subsequently evicted 5-1.\n\nGeorge won the first Week 7 Head of Household competition during a double eviction week and had to make his nominations on the spot. George went after James and Erika. However, James won the veto. Howie became the replacement nominee and was evicted. Mike \"Boogie\" won the next HoH competition, choosing to nominate Janelle and James. This was the second time that Janelle and James were nominated together. Janelle again saved herself with the Power of Veto during a controversial competition. James claimed that Janelle stole a doll from him and thus, cheated. George was placed alongside James as a pawn. Mike \"Boogie\" has stated his intention is to evict James and on day 53 he was evicted by a 3 to 1 vote.\n\nJanelle Marie Pierzina (born January 10, 1980), 38, is one of the Houseguests whose original season was \"Big Brother 6\". Janelle likes to think of herself as a buxom blonde. On Big Brother 6, she finished third, losing to Ivette Corredero and Maggie Ausburn. During her time in the Big Brother 6 house, she was quite popular in the public's eye, winning numerous America's Choice prizes and having an extremely high popularity rating of 93% on the second-to-last week of Big Brother 6, thus, establishing her as being the most popular female Big Brother Houseguest of all time and tying fellow Big Brother 6 contestant, Kaysar, who is the most popular male Big Brother Houseguest of all time.\n\nIn the first week in the \"Big Brother 7\" house, Janelle shared the Head of Household power with Jase, and the two collaborated to nominate Danielle and Alison for eviction. Janelle also won the Veto that week, but chose not to use it.\n\nJanelle became Head of Household again on Week 4, marking the fourth consecutive week that an All-Star originating from \"Big Brother 6\" was in power. Janelle found it difficult to choose between nominating floaters and nominating Will and Mike, the components of Chill Town. Perhaps swayed by several different Houseguests, Janelle nominated Mike \"Boogie\" and Erika, one from each of the groups. When Mike won the Power of Veto and subsequently saved himself, she replaced him with Diane. This was to ensure that a floater would leave that week. This move was controversial among the Houseguests, as it seemed Chill Town had major input in the decision.\n\nOn Week 5, Danielle won the Head of Household competition. Having been quite frustrated with Janelle's actions the previous week, Danielle chose to nominate her alongside James, whose role was that of a pawn. Janelle proved tenacious, however, when she won the Power of Veto, allowing her to veto her nomination. Janelle used the Power of Veto and Danielle nominated Janelle's ally Kaysar in her place.\n\nOn Week 6, a live competition was shown that revealed that Erika had won the Head of Household competition. Throughout the competition, however, there were several technical errors, including Howie's buzzer malfunction. Because of this, the competition was re-run, and Janelle emerged as the winner. She nominated the two other remaining women in the house, Danielle and Erika. Danielle won the Power of Veto, and Janelle was forced to make a replacement nomination. With much persuasion by Howie, James, Will, and Mike, Janelle finally agreed to nominate her good friend Marcellas. Under the impression he would be spared and Erika would be evicted, Janelle was disappointed to see Marcellas get evicted. Immediately following Marcellas' eviction, the Houseguests learned that another of them would be leaving the following night. Chicken George won the Head of Household competition and chose to nominate Erika and James. When James won the Veto and used it, George put up another of Janelle's allies, Howie. He was evicted over Erika. Was on current season.\n\nOn Week 7, the HoH competition was won by Mike \"Boogie,\" who chose to nominate James and Janelle. Janelle won the Veto competition yet again, saving herself from eviction for the second time this season. James was evicted on Day 53 by a 3-1 vote.\n\nOn Week 8, Erika became Head of Household for the first time this season. The following day, Erika nominated Janelle and George for eviction, stating that her intention was to get Janelle out. Janelle went on to win her fourth Veto of the season the following day, however, and took herself off the block. She wasreplaced with Danielle. On Day 60, Danielle was evicted by a 3-0 vote. Also on day 60, Janelle won her fourth HoH of the season and nominated George and Erika. Immediately following her nominations, the Veto competition took place, and Erika won the Veto, saving herself. . Janelle replaced Erika with Mike \"Boogie\". On Day 60, by a vote of 2-0, Chicken George was evicted from the Big Brother: All-Stars house.\n\nOn Week 9, Mike \"Boogie\" won the Head of Household competition, nominating Erika and Janelle. On Day 62, Janelle won yet another Veto competition, once again saving herself from possible eviction. With only Will left to fill Janelle's spot, Mike was forced to nominate his Chill Town ally. As the sole voter, Janelle was all set up to evict Erika, as Will had done his best to influence her like usual. Some conversation with Erika, however, lead to the revelation that both women had been told they were part of Chill Town. Feeling as though she'd been played, Janelle voted to evict Will, leaving the final three as her, Mike \"Boogie,\" and Erika. This unlikely trio were the participants in one of the most bizarre moments in Big Brother history.\n\nThe final Head of Household competition was set up in the traditional three-round format, with the first round again being an endurance competition. Contestants stood on pegs on the side of an improvised mountain, grasping with both hands keys placed above their heads. It promised to be an hours long ordeal, but immediately upon the start of the competition Mike, somewhat cryptically invoking the name of \"Survivor\" contestant Richard Hatch, intentionally abandoned his post, stating aloud his belief that even if he were not to win Head of Household he was assured a spot in the finals as both women would rather face him than each other.\n\nMike's unexpected actions and bizarre words further discombobulated an already confused Janelle, who never seemed entirely certain of the rules. Straining to see and comprehend what he had done, she accidentally, barely but perceivably removed one of her hands from her key. Julie Chen had no choice but to announce her elimination, leaving Erika as the winner of an endurance competition that lasted less than five minutes. In the second round, titled \"Fly by Night\" and involving firing simulated lasers while suspended from ropes attached to harnesses, Mike defeated Janelle, advancing him to the round 3. He beat out Erika in a question and answer competition to clinch the last Head of Household competition, and he chose to evict Janelle.\n\nJanelle set or tied a great variety of records this season. Julie Chen announced (on Janelle's eviction night) that Janelle had won the most competitions in a single and double season of any BB series. She won a total of 4 Head of Household competitions, 5 Power of Veto competitions and 2 America's choice, in this season alone, tying the record for most Head of Household wins set by Drew Daniel, and setting records for most Veto wins (since tied by Daniele Donato) and most America's Choice wins in one season. In season 6 she had won 2 Head of Households, 2 vetos and 2 America's Choice. In total (from both seasons), she had won 17 competitions, excluding the luxury prizes she had won in season six.\n\nOn finale night, Janelle was announced as the winner of the last-second America's Choice prize. She walked away with $25,000.00.\n\nJason \"Jase\" Wirey was originally a contestant on Big Brother 5. It has been a common misconception that his name was Zach but On Big Brother Happy Hour with Chelsia and Missy, he revealed that his name was not actually Zach but just short for Jason. Because of his over-the-top, rambunctious nature, Jase was not well received by viewers or HouseGuests during that season. He was difficult to eliminate, however, as he was quite a competitor for Veto Challenges. This sparked Nakomis' infamous \"Six-Finger Plan,\" a method of removing someone that leaves them defenseless. This is commonly referred to as \"backdooring.\"\n\nAt the Veto, however, Chicken George saved himself, and, after some deliberation, James agreed to target Jase instead. Jase was not too happy about the turn of events, as he hated the idea of being \"backdoored\" again (though, in this case, it wasn't originally a planned backdooring). After a controversial outburst in the backyard, several HouseGuests felt much animosity toward Jase. Particularly, Marcellas and Jase had a confrontation that proceeded inside the house as well. Despite his efforts, he was indeed nominated in George's place. Though he hated the method of his elimination, Jase was evicted unanimously (9-0) in Week 3. He requested that only Diane and Danielle escort him to the door. Also he has been on an episode of the TV show The 5th Wheel which airs on Fox Reality.\n\nKaysar Ridha (born August 10, 1980), 37, was a Houseguest on Season 6 of \"Big Brother\". He was the first Muslim-American in the Big Brother house, as well as being of Iraqi descent. While this did possibly lead to his nomination on Week 1, he was not evicted. He went on to evict the leader of the house's majority alliance, gathering a group of under-dogs and forming \"The Sovereign Six.\" He was evicted the following week when the opposing alliance came into power. In a twist, Kaysar was voted back into the House with 82% of America's votes. That same week, he allowed a member of the opposing alliance to become Head of Household and was evicted again. Kaysar is one of five contestants to ever re-enter the Big Brother house in one season, the others being Amy Crews from Season 3, Sharon Obermueller and \"Crazy\" James Zinkand from Season 9, and Brendon Villegas from Season 13. Kaysar became one of the most popular Houseguests in Big Brother US History, along with Janelle. At one point, he held a 93% popularity rating, thus becoming Big Brother's most popular male houseguest of all time.\n\nKaysar was voted into the \"Big Brother 7\" House, where he was immediately perceived as arrogant by Mike \"Boogie\" Malin and Will Kirby. As one of four contestants from \"Big Brother 6\" to enter the All-Star house, Kaysar's alliance had an immediate target. On Week 2, Kaysar became Head of Household and he chose to nominate \"floaters\" Nakomis and Diane. Throughout the show he has been closely linked to Erika, though this is likely to have been through editing especially as Kaysar's Muslim beliefs prevent him from dating. (Erika has since claimed to be romantically linked to Mike \"Boogie,\" even before the game and claimed Kaysar was her best friend in the house.) With Big Brother 6 alumni constantly becoming HoH in the first four weeks, Kaysar didn't have to worry about facing nomination early on. On Week 5, however, Kaysar was nominated during the veto ceremony after Janelle used the veto on herself and was evicted by a vote of five to one (Janelle's vote being nullified). Coincidentally, he left the house on his 26th birthday. Kaysar is the only one to have come back in both his seasons and to have been evicted 4 times in 12 months\n\nMarcellas Reynolds , 47, was a houseguest from \"Big Brother 3\". During week 2 Marcellas won HoH. He nominated house guests Josh Fineberg and Tonya Paoni, resulting in the eviction of Tonya. Marcellas won his 2nd HoH during week 8. He nominated house guests Amy Crews and Roddy Mancuso, resulting in the eviction of Roddy. During week 9 Marcellas was nominated for eviction by HoH Jason Guy. Subsequently Marcellas won the first ever Golden Power of Veto competition. During the Veto Ceremony Marcellas failed to use the Golden Power of Veto on himself and was evicted. Because of this move, host Julie Chen jokingly slapped him on the head during his exit interview. He was evicted on day 69.\n\nHe hosted \"\" with Gretchen Massey during \"Big Brother 5\" and \"6\". However, due to his participation in the All-Stars edition, he was unable to host the 3rd season.\n\nA producers pick for Season 7, during Week 6, Marcellas was nominated by HoH Janelle when her original nominee, Danielle, used the Veto. Marcellas was evicted from the Big Brother house on day 46 and became the first member of the Big Brother jury. At the Big Brother 7 finale Marcellas cast the lone vote for fellow house guest Erika Landin.\n\nMichael Robert \"Mike\" \"Boogie\" Malin (born July 16, 1970), 47, was a Houseguest of Big Brother 2, one of the components of the infamous alliance \"Chill Town.\" Having been eligible to enter the house, Mike claimed that he had plans for taking out his old ally as well as friend and business partner Will Kirby. However, this may have just been talk to improve his chances of entering the house.\n\nUpon entering the house, however, he once again aligned himself heavily with Will, and the two re-established the \"Chill Town\" alliance. This seemingly created a target for the two, but they both were shocked several times not to be nominated. There has been speculation around the internet that Mike was only chosen because Will refused to participate without his buddy from Season 2. This belief was supported by an admission on the live feeds in the HOH by Will to James and Kaysar that he refused to participate unless Boogie was on the show. The producers cut the live feed soon after this statement. The topic was even discussed on CBS' , on which he is constantly referred to as \"Booger.\" Mike Boogie was nominated on Week 4 by Head of Household Janelle, alongside Erika. He won the Power of Veto that week, however, earning him the ability to rescue himself. Mike used the Veto and Diane took his place. He and Will formed an alliance with Danielle and Season Six houseguest James- who had felt betrayed by his previous alliance. They referred to this alliance as the \"Legion of Doom\" but Danielle felt angry at her allies last week when they didn't try in the veto competition- letting Janelle win it. Mike and Will have also formed an alliance with remaining Sovereigns Janelle and Howie despite having declared early intention to see the two evicted. The four called this alliance \"The Perfect Storm\". He also has an alliance with Erika- who is he rumored to have been romantically involved with before the show began and has recently been making out with inside the house. He is working to save one of his allies Erika in favor of evicting Marcellas who he has referred to as a \"cancer\". At the end of Week 6, Mike was informed that he had won the new power of Coup D'État, which gives him the right to overthrow the Head of Household on the live eviction night and replace their nominees with any two people he chooses, excluding the Head of Household and the Veto holder. Week 7 was a double-eviction week. Feeling betrayed by \"Chill Town,\" evicted houseguest Howie confronted Mike on his way out the door, going as far as to throw the hat Mike was wearing across the room. Mike won the second HoH of the week. He chose to nominate Janelle and James, with the intention of evicting James. His wish was granted when Janelle won the Power of Veto and James was voted out 3-1.\nAt the final four, Mike won his second Head of Household of the season and nominated Janelle and Erika. Janelle won the Power of Veto again and the only remaining choice for Mike to nominate was his friend Will. Mike was shocked and saddened when Janelle decided to evict Will over Erika. He threw part one of the final HOH competition telling Julie Chen to remember Richard Hatch (this in reference to \"\" when Richard Hatch threw the final immunity challenge as both of the other players would have to take him to have any shot at winning). He faced off against Janelle in part two of the Head of Household competition and defeated her. He also won the final part of the HOH against Erika. As HOH, he decided to evict Janelle, making Erika his opponent in the jury vote. He won Big Brother All Stars by a vote of 6-1.\n\nJennifer Jeannene \"Nakomis\" Dedmon (born April 25, 1983), 35, better known as \"Nakomis,\" made her Big Brother debut on Season 5. During Big Brother 5, Nakomis gained much recognition for a variety of things. One of the biggest twists of her season was her previously unknown connection to half-brother Michael \"Cowboy\" Ellis. While the two were happy to discover one another, they became parts of opposing alliances, and Cowboy went on to evict her. Nakomis was the inventor of the infamous \"Six-Finger Plan,\" a method of easily evicting a player. This plan was used to evict Jase, another houseguest on Big Brother 7. He derided Nakomis and her methods of eviction during the season.\n\nNakomis garnered enough of America's votes to participate in \"Big Brother All-Stars\". Upon entering the house, Nakomis said that she was surrounded with beautiful people and that she was not a \"girly-girl.\" During Week 2, Nakomis was nominated for eviction by Kaysar, who claimed to have nominated her because she is very intelligent, as well as claiming to have intended to nominate \"floaters\" in the game. On Day 18, Nakomis became the second houseguest to be evicted from the Big Brother: All Stars house. Only Janelle and Will chose not to vote against Nakomis, opting instead to vote for nominee Diane.\n\nWilliam \"Will\" Terence Kirby (born January 2, 1973), 45, (sometimes called \"Dr. Will\" and Dr. Delicious and The Puppet Master) was the winner of Big Brother 2. He was the only winner to enter the All-Star house, a fact he believed to be a definite disadvantage. Will is nearly universally known for his extremely deceptive gameplay, creating a complex web of bogus alliances that helped him reach the Final Two.\n\nWith such a devious reputation preceding him, as well as his position as the only Big Brother Champ in the All-Star house, Will very much expected to be nominated on Week 1. To his great shock, he wasn't nominated, and he found this offensive. It's quite possible that this is merely Will's dry sense of humor. It should be noted, however, that Will has complained about needing to return home - as his career and relationship may suffer from sequester. Will ran into early conflicts with Howie, as the two thrived on exchanging insults. On Week 3, James nominated Will for eviction, alongside Chicken George. George won the Veto, but still gave Will the opportunity to speak. Will used this opportunity to explain to the Houseguests that he was having trouble thriving in the game because he could not find one of them he hated more than the other, as he hated them all so much. He claimed that, if he were not evicted, he would throw food challenges, Head of Household challenges, and Power of Veto challenges until he was. Ironically enough, Jase, the replacement nominee for George, was evicted instead of Will. Will had been perceived as fairly crazy in the house, having done such things as putting on a puppet show in the bathtub - his interpretation of the game thus far. Will was linked with Mike \"Boogie\" Malin, also an alumnus of Big Brother 2, as well as their original alliance, \"Chill Town.\" The two managed to make several connections in the house. Despite mentioning the desire to evict Chill Town, the Season Six alliance never chose to do so despite winning the first four HOH competitions. This is largely credited to a web of bogus deals created by Chill Town and Will's claim of wanting to go home before sequester and that he would voluntarily leave the week before sequester point. The game reached beyond that point however before Will was evicted. Late in the season, Will seemed to acquire much influence over Janelle, a fortunate truth for him, as she had proven quite versatile in HoH competitions. He was largely responsible for Marcellas' eviction, as well as that of Diane in earlier weeks. Will was placed on the hotseat by Mike, having no other options after Janelle used the veto on herself. Will was evicted out of the house by Janelle on Day 65. Will was redeemed though when his friend Mike Boogie won the final Head of Household and chose to evict Janelle. Will, along with Janelle, Chicken George, Danielle, James, and Howie voted for Will's friend and Chilltown ally Mike Boogie, giving him a 6-1 victory over Erika. Dr. Will is considered as one of the greatest players of all time.\n"}

{"id": "857659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857659", "title": "List of rulers of Kongo", "text": "List of rulers of Kongo\n\nThis is a list of the rulers of the Kingdom of Kongo known commonly as the Manikongos (KiKongo: Mwenekongo). Mwene (plural: Awene) in Kikongo meant a person holding authority, particularly judicial authority, derived from the root -wene which meant, by the sixteenth century at least, territory over which jurisdiction was held. The ruler of Kongo was the most powerful mwene in the region who the Portuguese regarded as the king (in Kikongo \"ntinu\" king upon their arrival in 1483.\n\nThe kingdom of Kongo had a formal state apparatus, in which most positions (\"rendas\" in Portuguese-language documents, meaning income bearing positions) were in the hands of the king, and the king himself was elected by powerful officials. Kings sought and held office with the assistance of a kanda. Each kanda (plural: \"makanda\") was a faction which organized people according to a common goal, often but not always rooted in a kin-based relationship. Kandas generally took the name of a person (i.e. Nimi, Nlaza or Mpanzu), but could also take the name of a location or title such as Mbala (court)) or birthplace (Kwilu or Nsundi). The Kikongo prefix \"ki\" is added onto these names to mean \"people with something in common\". These factions were recorded as \"gerações\" or \"casas\" (lineages or houses) in Kongo documents written in Portuguese. Until the mid-seventeenth century, following the Battle of Mbwila, these factions were short lived and fluctuating, but following the battle, factions were much firmer and lasted for generations, particularly the Kimpanzu and Kinlaza. The Quilombo dos Palmares a Maroom Kingdom formed in Northeast Brazil. Was founded by Princes and Nobles who were enslaved and transported to Portuguese Brazil after the Battle. There they retained their titles and their lineage survived even after the kingdom itself was destroyed.\n\nWhen the Portuguese arrived in Kongo in 1483, the reigning king represented the Nimi kanda. This kanda was probably descended from Nimi a Nzima, father of the founder of Kongo. Divisions emerged within the kanda during succession disputes, for example, following the death of Afonso I in 1542, his son Pedro I and grandson Diogo I formed two opposed factions, that of Pedro was called the Kibala (court) faction, and the other, whose name is unknown that followed Diogo. Other elections in the sixteenth century probably also involved similar factions, though the details are unknown. \n\nKing Álvaro I was the first king of the House of Kwilu (Portuguese: \"Coulo\"). This kanda or lineage was named for the birthplace of Álvaro, north of the capital city. The Kwilu reigned until 1614 when Antonio da Silva, Duke of Mbamba intervened to place Bernardo I on the throne, in place of Álvaro II's minor son, who would eventually take office as Álvaro III. \n\nAnother kanda, the House of Nsundi, later known as the Kinkanga a Mvika, took control of Kongo in 1622 under Pedro II, and retained it through the reign of his son, Garcia I. Garcia never held power strongly, and the Kimpanzu returned to power under Ambrosio I. Kimpanzu domination ended in 1641 when two brothers Álvaro and Garcia of the new House of Kinlaza overthrew Álvaro V and took power. The members of the Kikanga a Mvika were all killed or absorbed into the Kinlaza by 1657. The Kinlaza dynasty would reign until Kongo's catastrophic civil war following the 1665 Battle of Mbwila, when sporadic and violent alternation followed.\n\nThe capital was destroyed in 1678. Its destruction forced the claimants from both sides of the conflict to rule from mountain fortresses. The Kinlaza retreated to Mbula where they founded the capital of Lemba. Earlier another branch of Kinlaza, under the leadership of Garcia III of Kongo founded a settlement at Kibangu. The Kimpanzu based their struggle for the throne at Mbamba Luvota in the south of Soyo. A new faction appeared in the form of the Água Rosada kanda, headquarteredd at the mountain fortress of Kibangu. This might be considered a new house formed from both the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu, its founders were the children of a Kimpanzu father and a Kinlaza mother. All parties claimed kingship over Kongo (or what was left of it), but their power rarely spread outside their fortresses or the immediate surrounding area.\n\nThe country was finally reunited by Pedro IV of the Água Rosada kanda. Pedro IV declared a doctrine of shared power by which the throne would shift (in due time) from Kinlaza to the Kimpanzu and back., while the Água Rosada appear to have continued as neutral in Pedro's fortress of Kibangu.\n\nThe system functioned sporadically, with considerable fighting, until 1764 when José I of the Kinlaza faction usurped the throne and thrust the country back into civil war. The Kinlaza enjoyed a short lived second dynasty that ended in 1788. After that, the throne moved through various royal hands until the kingship was extinguished in 1914.\n\nThe selection of kings of Kongo was by a variety of principles, as kings themselves evoked different methods of selection in their letters announcing their succession. Typically the kingdom was said to pass by election, though the electors and the process they used changed over time and according to circumstances. Frequently election seems to have been a combination of elective and hereditary principals.\n\nThe following section is divided into periods based on kanda or house rulership. Most houses reigned of a distinct period with few if any intervals. This is not the case, however; after the Kongo Civil War. During this period you will note the name of each king's kanda alongside their reign.\n\n\nMbele tribe, butembo kaLanga,komo kaLanga. Mon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Portuguese abolished the title of King of Kongo following the revolt of 1914.\n\n\nThe Quilombo dos Palmares was a Maroon Kingdom formed in the Captaincy of Pernambuco in what is now Northeast Brazil sometime around 1605 by Princes and Nobles from the Kingdom of Kongo captured during the Battle of Mbwila and transported there as slaves. After having escaped slavery they retained their noble titles. They probably belonged to the House of Awenekongo of the Nlaza kanda of Antonio I.\n\n\nThis list is constructed primarily from that found in Graziano Saccardo, \"'Congo e Angola con la storia dell'antica missione dei cappuccini\" (3 vols, Milan, 1982–83), vol. 3, pp. 11–14. Saccardo bases his reconstruction on several kinglists produced over time, by António da Silva, Duke of Mbamba in 1617, by António de Teruel in 1664, by Pedro Mendes in 1710 and by Francisco das Necessidades in 1844. In addition many of the kings wrote letters and signed them with both their names and their numbers, and Saccardo has found many of these to verify the kinglists.\n\nSaccardo's king list has been modified in the following manner: the Kikongo names of the kings have been given in a Kikongo form following norms established in Joseph de Munck, \"Kinkulu kia Nsi eto\"' (Tumba, 1956, 2nd ed, Matadi, 1971). The Christian names of the kings are given in modern Portuguese spelling. In addition Saccardo's entries have been updated by a number of sources, most notably the kinglist, unknown to him found in the Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Brasileiro (Rio de Janeiro) Manuscritos, Lata 6, pasta 2. \"Catallogo dos reis de Congo\" MS of c. 1758.\n\n\n"}

As a child he and his family were allegedly subjected to a range of poltergeist disturbances in their Cambridge home and later at Oakham School. Today, Manning works as a psychic healer and lecturer.\n\nIn the 1960s, it was alleged that Manning was the focus of poltergeist activity. He started performing automatic drawing and writings. Covering his bedroom walls appeared over six hundred signatures spanning six centuries. It was noted at the time that Manning had been researching history as part of his school work. According to Joe Nickell who made an in-depth study of Manning's writings, they contain internal inconsistencies and the \"signatures\" are completely inaccurate for historical individuals. Nickell concluded that Manning has \"traits associated with a fantasy-prone personality\" and there is no evidence he possesses genuine paranormal powers.\n\nRegarding his automatic drawings. He claimed to draw in the styles of many famous artists including Pablo Picasso. Manning told \"The San Francisco Examiner\" that an art expert at Sotheby's in London had thought one of his Picasso copies so good it might be mistaken for an original. The skeptic James Randi investigated this claim by writing to the gallery. A Sotheby’s official replied that the claim was \"absolutely not true\" as they were forgeries of existing works. Manning told the \"London Daily Mirror\" his drawing of a monkey had caused \"great excitement\" because it was strikingly similar to an original by Jan Savery that the Rijksmuseum kept locked away from public display in a vault. This was also investigated by Randi who wrote a letter to the museum and it was discovered the claim was false as the original was on display to the public, not locked up in a vault.\n\nManning was also tested for psychokinetic abilities by parapsychologist William G. Braud of the Mind Science Foundation in the late 1970s, with results that, according to Braud and coauthors in a psychical research paper published in 1979, were better than chance. Additionally during this time, it was reported that he could \"bend metal paranormally, affect electrical equipment, move compass needles, and make medical diagnoses.\" The magician John Booth has written Manning's metal bending is a magic trick performed while lightly stroking the object. The physicists John Taylor and Eduardo Balanovski tested Manning in distance viewing and the results proved \"completely unsuccessful\".\n\nThe events of his childhood and later investigations by George Owen of the Cambridge Psychical Research Society were published in a 1974 book entitled \"The Link\", which was translated into 16 languages and eventually sold more than a million copies.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "65096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65096", "title": "Richard Dadd", "text": "Richard Dadd\n\nRichard Dadd (1 August 1817 – 7 January 1886) was an English painter of the Victorian era, noted for his depictions of fairies and other supernatural subjects, Orientalist scenes, and enigmatic genre scenes, rendered with obsessively minuscule detail. Most of the works for which he is best known were created while he was a patient in Bethlem and Broadmoor hospitals.\n\nDadd was born at Chatham, Kent, England, the son of a chemist. He was educated at King's School, Rochester where his aptitude for drawing was evident at an early age, leading to his admission to the Royal Academy of Arts at the age of 20. He was awarded the medal for life drawing in 1840. With William Powell Frith, Augustus Egg, Henry O'Neil and others, he founded The Clique, of which he was generally considered the leading talent. He was also trained at William Dadson's Academy of Art.\n\nAmong his best-known early works are the illustrations he produced for \"The Book of British Ballads\" (1842), and a frontispiece he designed for \"The Kentish Coronal\" (1840).\n\nIn July 1842, Sir Thomas Phillips, the former mayor of Newport, chose Dadd to accompany him as his draughtsman on an expedition through Europe to Greece, Turkey, Southern Syria and finally Egypt. In November of that year they spent a gruelling two weeks in Southern Syria, passing from Jerusalem to Jordan and returning across the Engaddi wilderness. Toward the end of December, while travelling up the Nile by boat, Dadd underwent a dramatic personality change, becoming delusional, increasingly violent, and believing himself to be under the influence of the Egyptian god Osiris. His condition was initially thought to be sunstroke.\n\nOn his return in the spring of 1843, he was diagnosed to be of unsound mind and was taken by his family to recuperate in the countryside village of Cobham, Kent. In August of that year, having become convinced that his father was the Devil in disguise, Dadd killed him with a knife and fled to France. En route to Paris, Dadd attempted to kill a fellow passenger with a razor but was overpowered and arrested by police. Dadd confessed to killing his father and was returned to England, where he was committed to the criminal department of Bethlem psychiatric hospital (also known as Bedlam). Here and subsequently at the newly created Broadmoor Hospital, Dadd was cared for in an enlightened manner by Drs William Wood, William Orange and Sir W. Charles Hood.\n\nDadd probably suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Two of his siblings had the condition, while a third had \"a private attendant\" for unknown reasons.\n\nIn hospital Dadd was encouraged to continue painting, and in 1852 he created a remarkable portrait of one of his doctors, Alexander Morison, which now hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Dadd painted many of his masterpieces in Bethlem and Broadmoor, including \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\", which he worked on between 1855 and 1864. Dadd was pictured at work on his \"Contradiction: Oberon and Titania\" by the London society photographer Henry Hering. Also dating from the 1850s are the 33 watercolour drawings titled \"Sketches to Illustrate the Passions\", which include \"Grief or Sorrow\", \"Love\", and \"Jealousy\", as well as \"Agony-Raving Madness\" and \"Murder\". Like most of his works these are executed on a small scale and feature protagonists whose eyes are fixed in a peculiar, unfocused stare. Dadd also produced many shipping scenes and landscapes during his hospitalization, such as the ethereal 1861 watercolour \"Port Stragglin\". These are executed with a miniaturist's eye for detail which belie the fact that they are products of imagination and memory.\n\nAfter 20 years at Bethlem, Dadd was moved to Broadmoor Hospital, a high security facility outside London. Here he remained, painting constantly and receiving infrequent visitors until 7 January 1886, when he died \"from an extensive disease of the lungs\". A number of his works remain on display at Broadmoor.\n\n\"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\" inspired a song of the same name by the British rock band Queen. Also, the painting is a plot element in \"The Witches of Chiswick\" by Robert Rankin. \"The Wee Free Men\", a novel by Terry Pratchett, published in 2003, was partly inspired by it as well. \"The Hum and the Shiver\" by Alex Bledsoe includes references to a lost version of the painting. The painting and the artist are also referenced in Elizabeth Hand's novel \"Mortal Love\".\n\nThe British fantasy writer Angela Carter wrote \"Come unto these Yellow Sands\", a radio-play based on Dadd's life.\n\nThe full name of the eccentric character Mr Dick in \"David Copperfield\" by Charles Dickens is Richard Babley, which echoes the name of Dickens' contemporary Richard Dadd.\nCanadian author R.J. Anderson acknowledges Dadd as the basis of her fictional painter Alfred Wrenfield, who figures prominently in her young adult fantasy novel \"Knife\" (\"Faery Rebels: Spell Hunter\" in the USA).\n\nIn 1987 a long-lost watercolour by Dadd, \"The Artist's Halt in the Desert\", was discovered by Peter Nahum on the BBC TV programme \"Antiques Roadshow\". Made while the artist was incarcerated, it is based on sketches made during his tour of the Middle East, and shows his party encamped by the Dead Sea, with Dadd at the far right. It was later sold for £100,000 to the British Museum.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8975025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8975025", "title": "Robert William Felkin", "text": "Robert William Felkin\n\nDr Robert William Felkin FRSE LRCSE LRCP (13 March 1853 – 28 December 1926) was a medical missionary and explorer, a ceremonial magician and member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a prolific author on Uganda and Central Africa, and early anthropologist, with an interest in ethno-medicine and tropical diseases.\n\nHe was founder in 1903 of the Stella Matutina, a new Order based on the original Order of the Golden Dawn, with its Hermes Temple in Bristol, UK and, later, Whare Ra (or more correctly, the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple) in Havelock North, New Zealand in 1912.\n\nThe fullest account of his life is found in \"A Wayfaring Man\", a fictionalised biography written by his second wife Harriet and published in serial form between 1936 and 1949.\n\nRobert William Felkin was born in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, on 13 March 1853, the son of Robert Felkin (1828-1899), a Nonconformist lace manufacturer. His grandfather, William Felkin (1795-1874), son of a Baptist minister, remains one of the best known names in the Victorian lace industry and was mayor of Nottingham in 1851, when he exhibited at the Great Exhibition. But he overreached, and the business failed disastrously in 1864, when Felkin retired to write standard works on the lace and hosiery trades. His son and partner Robert Felkin Sr settled in Wolverhampton to take up a position as manager of the home department of Mander Brothers, varnish manufacturers. Robert Jr was educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School, where he met the explorer David Livingstone, who inspired him to become a medical missionary.\n\nHe worked for a period in Chemnitz, Germany, after his schooling, where his uncle Henry Felkin lived, and became fluent in the language. In about 1876 he began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh. In 1878, as yet unlicensed, he joined a mission led by the Church Missionary Society to Central Africa. He travelled up the Nile to Khartoum, where he met General Gordon, and then on through what was then wild and unmapped country to the African Great Lakes. Eventually he spent two years in Africa, and became personal physician to King M’tesa, who had previously tried to kill him. In Zanzibar, he actively campaigned against the slave trade. He published several articles on tropical medicine and childbirth in medical journals, and also wrote \"Uganda and the Egyptian Soudan\" (1882, with Rev.C.T. Wilson), \"Egypt Present and To Come\" (1885), \"Uganda\" (1886), and other African works.\n\nIn 1881, he returned to Edinburgh when his health deteriorated to complete his medical studies (LRCP, LRCS, Ed, 1884). While still a medical student he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, a member of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and a corresponding Fellow of the Berlin Anthropological Society.\n\nIn 1882 Felkin married his first wife, Mary (\"Polly\"), daughter of Samuel Small Mander of Wolverhampton, his father's employer, who had been a friend since childhood, and became a collaborator in both his esoteric work and his work for child welfare. They had a son (Samuel) Denys and a daughter, Ethelwyn (1883-1962), who was to publish on the legacy of the Golden Dawn under the name \"Ethel Felkin\".\n\nIn 1884 he studied further in Marburg, acquiring his M.D. there in 1885. Following this he practiced as a doctor in Edinburgh for some years, returning to Africa and travelling frequently with his wife in Europe.\n\nMary and Robert seem to have been introduced to esotericism through a Bible study circle they joined in Edinburgh; other scriptures were discussed, including the \"Tao te ching\" and the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and some members of the group were Theosophists. Robert and Mary joined the Theosophical Society in Edinburgh in 1886, but found it lacking in terms of ritual, and eventually joined John William Brodie-Innes' Amen-Ra Temple of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn on 1894-03-12.\n\nHe continued to write and publish: he edited (with others) a collection of the letters and journals of Mehmet Emin Pasha, whom he had met (translated by Mary), which appeared in 1888, and published \"Hypnotism, or Psycho-Therapeutics\" in 1890. Following a breakdown from strain and overwork he transferred his practice to London in 1896.\n\nIn 1903 Mary died and Robert reinforced his commitment to both Anglican Christianity and occultism. He made a retreat at the monastery of the Mirfield fathers, the Community of the Resurrection, and considered joining the order. Several of the Mirfield fathers had an interest in Rosicrucian and Golden Dawn Christian mysticism, and regarded Felkin as an eminent figure in that tradition. One of these priests, Father Fitzgerald, would later play a key role in bring Felkin to New Zealand.\n\nAlso in 1903, a schism occurred within the Order of the Golden Dawn, when Felkin and Brodie-Innes split from A.E. Waite to form the magically-inclined Order of the Stella Matutina. The poet W.B. Yeats joined the Stella Matutina and was a member for 20 years. Felkin’s main temple in London was called Amoun.\n\nFrom the time that Felkin assumed leadership of the Stella Matutina, he came increasingly under the influence of the \"Sun Masters\", the fabled Secret Chiefs of the Order, and other supposed adepts on the astral plane. Having these supposed contacts reinforced his position as leader in the order. Around 1908 he also claimed to have contacted an \"Arab Teacher\" called Ara Ben Shemesh (\"Lion Son of the Sun\"), one of the \"Sons of Fire\" inhabiting a Near Eastern \"temple in the desert\", who had been given special permission to contact and teach Western students. His first contact with Ara Ben Shemesh seems to be recounted in \"A Wayfaring Man\", which describes how a conversation between Felkin and Waite was interrupted by the appearance of a \"shadowy presence\". Felkin called for Harriet, who was clairvoyant, and she saw \"a tall man in Eastern dress, kuftan, galabieh, and turban. He has a smooth olive face, and large dark eyes.\" Apparently this figure, described in the account as \"the Chaldean\", was seeking someone to help in uniting Eastern and Western teaching. Upon learning that he \"believed in the Lord Jesus Christ\", Felkin and Waite agreed to collaborate with him.\n\nAnother mystical teacher was Sri Parananda, whom Felkin claimed to have first seen materialising out of steam at the Bad Pyrmont baths in Germany. This apparition, described as a dark Eastern man with a beard and large black eyes, wearing a flowing robe and a peculiar conical cap, arranged with Felkin to meet him in exactly one month in the lounge of the Carlton Hotel in London. According to Felkin their subsequent meeting in the flesh was the start of a series of conversations that lasted for several years.\n\nFelkin was initiated Freemasonry in Mary Chapel Lodge, Edinburgh, on 8 January 1907, was passed to the Fellow Craft degree on 12 February and raised to Master Mason on 26 February. On 11 April that same year he was admitted to the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA), Metropolitan College, to which only Master Masons are admitted. The officiating celebrant was Dr. W. Wynn Westcott, Supreme Magus of that society and co-founder of the Golden Dawn.\n\nAccording to R. Ellwood, by the time Felkin first visited New Zealand in 1912 he was already a 32° Freemason, one of the highest to visit the country thus far. But according to K. Edney of the New Zealand SRIA, Felkin's interest in Freemasonry was probably slight; he was never Master of the Lodge nor joined the Holy Royal Arch, and it is unlikely that he joined any higher degrees; his motive for joining Freemasonry and the SRIA seems to have been to gain credibility with continental occultists and contact members of the original Rosicrucian society. Anna Sprengel, a member of this fabled German society of nearly god-like adepts, had allegedly warranted the founding of the Golden Dawn, and Felkin believed that she and her order still existed deep under cover in Germany, along with the tomb of Christian Rosencreutz. In search of this group he and Harriet travelled to Europe in 1906, 1910 and 1914, and on one of these trips he met with Rudolf Steiner and claimed to have contacted other Rosicrucian adepts. Felkin considered Steiner to be an extremely high initiate, and after their meeting incorporated elements of Anthroposophy into his practice, including homeopathy.\n\nDuring their 1914 trip the Felkins became stranded in Germany when Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August. Harriet's fictionalised account of his life suggests that he had been sent there on an urgent mission by the \"Sun Master\" Ara Ben Shemesh, despite all warnings of impending war. They managed to avoid arrest, and escaped the country via the neutral Netherlands with the help of German Masons.\n\nIn 1912 Felkin, together with Harriet and Ethelwyn, visited Havelock North, New Zealand at the invitation of the Society of the Southern Cross. This was a prayer and meditation group closely involved with the \"Havelock Work\", an arts and spirituality movement embraced by the whole town. Reginald and Ruth Gardiner and Harold Large, founders of both the Havelock Work and the Society of the Southern Cross, believed that eastern methods of spiritual training such as Theosophy were unsuitable for westerners, but also felt that the Church had lost the esoteric teachings of Jesus and his disciples. They were determined to undergo rigorous training and initiation to merit learning those hidden teachings. These three had started daily meditations together, and were soon joined by Miss M. M. McLean and Reginald's sister, Miss Rose Gardiner. Reginald Gardiner considered the Havelock Work to be a cultural society \"built around this silent power station\". The meditation group grew, and began to incorporate simple ritual, calling itself the Society of the Southern Cross.\n\nIn 1910 the Mirfield Fathers sent a mission of help to New Zealand, preaching and conducting retreats. Miss McLean, who had met Father Fitzgerald in Britain, arranged for him to meet members of the Havelock prayer group, and he agreed to direct their spiritual work from Britain. He instructed them in an esoteric approach to Christianity, but soon decided they had reached a stage where personal instruction was necessary for further progress, and he recommended Dr. Robert Felkin for the task. Within a week the group had cabled £300 passage, supplied by Maurice Chambers and his father, Mason, and his uncle John, for Felkin, Harriet and Ethelwyn to visit New Zealand for three months. During this visit in 1912 Dr Felkin established the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple of the Stella Matutina. The New Zealand Order became known by the Maori name of Whare Ra or \"the House of the Sun\". Foundations of the house at Whare Ra were laid down by the architect Chapman-Taylor, who later became a member of both the Golden Dawn and the Order of the Table Round (Ordo Tabulae Rotundae), a neo-Arthurian mystical and chivalric order also brought to New Zealand by Felkin.\n\nBack in England in 1916 Felkin was appointed Inspector General of colonial colleges for the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, although he seems never to have functioned in this capacity. In that same year he also founded three more daughter-Temples of the Stella Matutina, together with a side-order, and claimed to found the Guild of St. Raphael. He published on the theme of 'Rosicrucian medicine' and, at the height of the German U-boat activity, emigrated permanently with his family to New Zealand, as his health broke down with recurrent malaria and other tropical diseases.\n\nOne year later, in September 1917, Felkin wrote to William Westcott, one of the two major founders of the Golden Dawn, that the Smaragdum Thallassess Temple had twenty members in the Second Order, thirty-four in the First Order, and ten people waiting to join.\n\nFelkin become involved in the Bahá'í Faith, through his meeting with `Abdu'l-Bahá in London in 1911 at Lady Blomfield's. Felkin introduced Maurice Chambers to the Faith and presented him with two Bahá'í ring stones that Abdu'l-Baha had given him. Felkin may have had an article on the Bahá'í Faith published in a local newspaper, although there had been an earlier article by British Baha'i Alice Buckton published circa 1909 in the Havelock Journal \"The Forerunner\".\n\nFelkin spent the rest of his life in New Zealand, where he continued to practise as a consulting physician as well as a magician between bouts of ill health. His strong personality and clinical acumen, combined with a kind and generous nature brought him patients from far afield, including Australia. On 28 December 1926, he died at Havelock North, and was buried in the Havelock North cemetery facing the Whare Ra, wearing the cloak, mantle and purple cross of a Knight of the Ordo Tabulae Rotundae. He was survived by his second wife Harriet, his daughter Ethelwyn, and two sons; Harriet and Ethelwyn were later buried with him.\n\n\n"}

He is known for his work with the musical group The Cassandra Complex and for his book on the magick of Aleister Crowley, \"Abrahadabra\".\n\nRodney Orpheus was born William Rodney Campbell on 8 July 1960 in Moneymore, Northern Ireland, and attended Rainey Endowed School on a scholarship. He became interested in music during the punk rock movement of the late 70s and led one of Ireland's first experimental punk bands, The Spare Mentals. In 1980 he migrated to Leeds, England where he formed The Cassandra Complex with Paul Dillon in 1984. The two, who met when Orpheus gatecrashed Dillon's 21st birthday party, originally financed the band by working at The Sorcerer's Apprentice occult store.\n\nAfter the release of The Cassandra Complex's first records Orpheus spent several years touring Europe, and while living in Aachen, Germany he joined Ordo Templi Orientis. Orpheus had studied the works of Aleister Crowley and other occult writers since his teenage years, and had previously founded and edited the UK occult newspaper \"Pagan News\" along with writer Phil Hine.\n\nWhile in Aachen he began work on the book \"Abrahadabra\", published by Looking Glass Press in Sweden and later republished by Weiser Books. The \"Ashe Journal\" described the book as \"a significant contribution to the field of Thelemic, or Crowleyan if you will, magick,\" and the \"Tree of Light\" journal said it was \"one of the very few competent and readable introductory texts to Thelemic magick.\"\n\nOrpheus moved to Hamburg, Germany in 1990 where he formed the Makhashanah Oasis (later Lodge) of O.T.O. During this period he also formed the band Sun God, based on Santería initiation he had received from Baba Raul Canizares on a visit to New York and inspired by the work of Vodou artist Sallie Ann Glassman. He set up a recording studio where The Cassandra Complex recorded their next albums, as well as producing and remixing several records for other German alternative artists, including Die Krupps and Girls Under Glass. Orpheus had a role in the German vampire movie \"Kiss My Blood\", and toured with The Sisters of Mercy. He was described as a \"technopagan\" in Mark Dery's 1996 overview of cyberculture \"Escape Velocity\":\n\nTo Rodney Orpheus the ease with which such metaphors are turned upside down underscores his belief that there's nothing oxymoronic about the term \"technopagan\" in end-of-the-century cyberculture. \"People say 'pagans sit in the forest worshipping nature; what are you doing drinking diet coke in front of a Macintosh?' \" says Orpheus, who in addition to being a card-carrying Crowleyite is a hacker and a mind machine aficionado. \"But when you use a computer, you're using your imagination to manipulate the computer's reality. Well, that's \"exactly\" what sorcery is all about – changing the plastic quality of nature on a nuts-and-bolts level. And that's why magickal techniques dating back hundreds of years are totally valid in a cyberpunk age.\"\nOrpheus had used Steinberg's computer music software in the studio for some time, and soon after moving to Hamburg he joined the company to pioneer their Internet Services division. He became a well-known figure presenting the company's software at trade shows, and in 1999 relocated to Los Angeles, to design one of the first Web 2.0 community sites, Cubase.net. While based in L.A., Orpheus served as a member of the US Grand Lodge O.T.O. Supreme Grand Council. He was still writing literature as well as music during this period: his horror short story \"Gothic Blood Dream\" and his poem \"Poison Butterflies\" would be published in the \"Gothic II\" anthology in 2002.\n\nIn Los Angeles Orpheus spent time working within the film sound industry and became a strong supporter of surround sound. This led to him moving to Henley-on-Thames and becoming Business Development Manager for the DTS Entertainment surround record label in 2004. During this period he produced the surround albums \"Planet Earth\" for LTJ Bukem and \"A Gigantic Globular Burst of Anti-Static\" for The Future Sound of London.\n\nIn 2007 he reformed the original line-up of The Cassandra Complex.\n\nOrpheus was appointed Deputy National Grand Master General for UK Grand Lodge of O.T.O.. at the Spring equinox 2009, and appeared on the O.T.O. podcast \"Thelema NOW!\" in September of that year; where he would make a second appearance in the August 2011 edition.\n\nHe appeared with Nick Margerrison on Kerrang Radio representing O.T.O. in May 2009:\n\nWe're chatting to a bloke, Rodney Orpheus, who is part of the religion which Crowley left behind after he died, it's called O.T.O. I'm asking him what would happen if we were to play out Crowley's magical spell ritual designed to call out demons. He tells me probably nothing, \"If demons were to come out of the radio I'd be very surprised, if they're going to come out of anywhere, they'll come out of people's heads\". Awesome. Great bit of radio. Hit play on the song. Two minutes in the station has a major technical glitch. The consoles in all three studios stop working. The mic won't turn on and then won't turn off. We play three songs in a row as we try to sort it out. Chaos as broadcast assistants and producers run about like headless chickens trying to sort it out. Technical response team on the phone. Finally we're back on air. Not the most impressive bit of radio ever. An example of Crowley's curse?\n\nHis most recent book on magick, \"Grimoire of Aleister Crowley\", was published by Abrahadabra Press in August 2011. It has been described as \"a truly exceptional modern grimoire\" by magical scholar and editor Colin Campbell.\n\nOrpheus has always been fascinated by games, and has written supplements for the tabletop game \"Car Wars\" from Steve Jackson Games . \n\nDuring a long period of recuperation after an operation in 2001 he started designing modules for the computer game \"Neverwinter Nights\", eventually running an online server called \"The Hidden Tradition\" and winning a Neverwinter Vault Hall of Fame award. This led him to spend time lecturing in games design at South Gloucestershire and Stroud College from 2008–2010.\n\nIn August 2012 Rodney led Sex & Magick workshop in Dublin covering the history of sexual magic, its influences from Eastern Tantric teachings, and its modern day practice.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016 Orpheus was Vice President of WholeWorldBand, an iOS application that enables music artists and fans to collaborate via the Web.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She often dresses as the cartoon character Underdog. She came to national attention through her appearances on and calls to \"The Howard Stern Show\" to discuss and perform her dance interpretation of Underdog. There she was given the nickname \"Underdog Lady\", though she personally rejects this name and prefers to be referred to as simply \"Underdog\" when wearing the costume.\n\nA longtime resident of Delran Township, New Jersey, Muldowney studied ballet as a child, and began performing interpretive dances of fictional characters in 1976. By 1980, she was appearing at costume contests at science fiction conventions. It was during this time that Muldowney started performing as the cartoon superhero Underdog. She has explained in an interview, \"I try to do certain movements that simulate flight and heroism. I'll make like I'm flying by doing leaps and other things. I also will do some camel spins. Basically I do movements that best portray Underdog. I try to do him more refined and sophisticated than the original character was.\"\n\nIn 1987, Muldowney began appearing in seasonal parades up and down the East Coast. Though her most famous dance interpretation is of Underdog, she has also portrayed Dracula, Catwoman and Supergirl, along with self-created characters such as Shelley the South Jersey Shore Mermaid, Irish Cinderella, and Spectrum the Ghost King. She sews all her own costumes, which are known for their exacting detail and elaborate ornamentation. For example, the interior of her Underdog cape is lined with streaks of silver, representing the streaks of light trailing behind the animated Underdog.\nMuldowney's earliest television appearances were on Beyond Vaudeville. Her first appearance was in 1986 and she continued to appear on the show through 1996. She also appeared in live stage versions of the show at New York University (1986-1990), Stand Up New York (1991) and Caroline's Comedy Club (1992-1994) She also appeared on Oddville, MTV.\n\nMuldowney made several appearances on Howard Stern's radio and television shows throughout the 1990s. A serious performer, she regrets her association with the program because of Stern's lewd jokes, and has called him her \"nemesis\". In 2006 she appeared as a guest on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" to demonstrate a new form of dancing she called \"figure jogging\".\n\nIn 2006 the documentary \"My Life as an Underdog\" was released by director Boris Gavrilovic.\n\nMuldowney has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome.\n\n"}
{"id": "600109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600109", "title": "Svetovid", "text": "Svetovid\n\nSvetovid, Svantovit or Sventovit is a Slavic deity of war, fertility and abundance primarily venerated on the island of Rügen into the 12th century. He is often considered a local Rugian variant of the pan-Slavic god Perun.\n\nSometimes referred to as Beli (or Byali) Vid (\"Beli\" = white, bright, shining), Svetovid is associated with war and divination and depicted as a four-headed god with two heads looking forward and two back. A statue portraying the god shows him with four heads, each one looking in a separate direction, a symbolical representation of the four directions of the compass, and also perhaps the four seasons of the year. Each face had a specific colour. The northern face of this totem was white (hence White Ruthenia / Belarus and the White Sea), the western, red (hence Red Ruthenia), the southern, black (hence the Black Sea) and the eastern, green (hence Zeleny klyn).\n\nJoined together, the four faces of Svetovid see all four sides of the world. This gave rise to a false etymology of the name of the god as \"world-seer\" (\"svet\" = \"world\", \"vid\" = \"sight\"; \"Svetovid\" = \"worldseer\"). However, the forms \"Sventevith\" and \"Zvantewith\" show that the name derives from the word \"svętъ\", meaning \"saint, holy\". The second stem is sometimes reconstructed as \"vit\" =,\"lord, ruler, winner\".\n\nThe name recorded in chronicles of contemporary Christian monks is Svantevit, which, if we assume it was properly transcribed, could be an adjective meaning approx. \"Dawning One\" (\"svantev\", \"svitanje\" = \"dawning, raising of the Sun in the morning\" + \"it\", adjective suffix), implying either a connection with the \"Morning Star\" or with the Sun itself.\n\nBeyond the names above referenced, Svetovid can also be known as Svitovyd (Ukrainian), Svyatovit (alternative name in Ukrainian), Svyentovit (alternative name in Ukrainian), Svetovid (Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, Macedonian and Bosnian, and alternative name in Bulgarian), Suvid (alternative name in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), Svantevit (Wendish, alternative name in Ukrainian and possibly the original proto-Slavic name), Svantevid (alternative name in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), Svantovit (Czech and Slovak), Svantovít (Czech), Svantovid (alternative name in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), Swantovít, Sventovit, Zvantevith (Latin and alternative name in Serbian and Croatian), Świętowit (Polish), Sutvid, Svevid, and Vid.\n\nThe original name of the island Rügen or Danish Rygen (Polish/Latin: Rugia) at the Baltic Sea was Rujan (meaning red in Old Slavic); thus the name would in translation imply 'The Red Island'. The autochthonous inhabitants of the island were the Slavic tribe, the Rujani, whose name was cognate with the island's; thus translating as people from Rujan. After the destruction and/or assimilation of the Rujani by the Danes, in 1168, the original Slavic name of Rujan was corrupted as Rügen in German and Rygen in Danish.\nAccording to various chronicles (i.e. Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus and Chronica Slavorum by Helmold), the temple at Jaromarsburg contained a giant wooden statue of Svantevit depicting him with four heads (or one head with four faces) and a horn of abundance. Each year the horn was filled with fresh mead.\n\nThe temple was also the seat of an oracle in which the chief priest predicted the future of his tribe by observing the behaviour of a white horse identified with Svantevit and casting dice (horse oracles have a long history in this region, being already attested in the writings of Tacitus). The temple also contained the treasury of the tribe and was defended by a group of 300 mounted warriors which formed the core of the tribal armed forces.\n\nDavid Leeming identifies the four heads as Rujevit, representing autumn and east, Porevit, representing summer and south, Iarovit, representing spring and west, and Bialobog, representing winter and north.\n\nSome interpretations claim that Svetovit was another name for Radegast, while another states that he was a fake god, a Wendish construction based on the name St. Vitus. However, the common practice of the Christian Church was to replace existing pagan deities and places of worship with analogous persons and rituals of Christian content, so it seems more likely that Saint Vitus was created to replace the original Svanto-Vit. According to a common interpretation, Svantevit was a Rugian counterpart of the pan-Slavic Perun.\n\nIn Croatia, on the island of Brač, the highest peak is called Vid's Mountain. In the Dinaric Alps there is a peak called \"Suvid\" and a Church of St. Vid. Among the Serbs, the cult of Svetovid is partially preserved through the Feast of St. Vitus, \"Vidovdan\", one of the most important annual events in Serbian Orthodox Christian tradition.\n\nThe science fiction story \"Delenda Est\" by Poul Anderson depicts an alternate history world where Carthage defeated Rome, Christianity never arose and in the 20th century, Svantevit is still a main deity of a major European power called Littorn (that is, Lithuania). A devotee of this god, in the story, is called Boleslav Arkonsky – a name evidently derived from the above-mentioned temple at Arkona.\n\n\n"}

Allen also has an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association.\n\nin 2017, while Chairwoman of the Arizona Senate Education Committee, The George Washington Academy charter school, of which she is a co-owner and co-founder, received an \"F\" Grade from the Arizona Department of Education.\n\nDuring her tenure as a county supervisor, Allen was said to have attempted to interfere with an internal investigation into the conduct of her son-in-law, a detention officer, with female inmates in the Navajo County jail, where he worked. K.C. Clark, the Navajo County Sheriff, threatened to arrest her if she continued to interfere. In March 2015, Allen filed a senate bill that would provide detention officers, like her son-in-law, with greater protections from disciplinary investigations. Allen has indicated that she was made aware of misdeeds within the jail and that she informed the Sheriff believing he would want to know. According to Allen, that is when her son-in-law was targeted and she discovered the Sheriff was both aware of and part of the problems in the jail. The Sheriff (himself a Democrat) has made a number of accusations that outside groups have spread throughout Allen's district in an effort to defeat her in the 2016 General Election. Allen has countered the Sheriff's claims by pointing out that she has the endorsement of a number of police associations.\n\nSpeaking at a June 2009 Rural Development and Retirement Committee hearing regarding a uranium mine, Allen said the world was \"6,000 years old.\"\n\nDuring a March 2015 Senate committee hearing on a bill that would relax concealed carry restrictions pertaining to public buildings, Allen, a member of the LDS Church, suggested that attending Sunday church services should be compulsory for Americans. Arizona state senate Democrat Steve Farley argued that even if church attendance might prove beneficial for society at large, Allen's proposal was a clear violation of separation of church and state laws, including the First Amendment to the US Constitution.\n\n"}

In his discourse \"On Exile\" he refers to events in the Chremonidean War in the 260s BC, and he makes a specific reference to Hippomedon's governorship in Thrace under Ptolemy III Euergetes in the years following 241 BC, thus this discourse was written shortly after this date. His native city is uncertain: he makes various indirect references to Megara which show that he was living and teaching there, but it is possible that he originally came from Athens. In Megara, Teles operated a school where he taught Cynic philosophy, selecting teachings from earlier philosophers and dispensing them to his pupils.\n\nSeven extracts of the lectures of Teles, totalling about thirty pages, are preserved by Stobaeus, although Stobaeus' own selections come from an earlier epitome by an otherwise unknown Theodorus. Thus what survives is a series of extracts from extracts, and it is quite possible that in between Teles and Theodorus, or Theodorus and Stobaeus, the writings went through a further editing process. The seven extracts are:\n\nAs a writer Teles has been regarded as being deficient in both literary and logical virtues, but this may reflect the way in which his works have been edited and compressed by Theodorus, Stobaeus, and others. The value of his writings lies in the fact that they are the earliest Cynic discourses (\"diatribes\") to survive, and they provide an insight into the Hellenistic world in which Teles lived. His works make frequent mention of Socrates and Diogenes, and he preserves important fragments from the works of Crates of Thebes, Metrocles, Stilpo and Bion of Borysthenes. Without him we would know little about the Cynic \"diatribe\" in the 3rd-century BC, and we would know much less about Bion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34936804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34936804", "title": "The Governor (The Walking Dead)", "text": "The Governor (The Walking Dead)\n\nThe Governor (real name Philip Blake in the TV series, and Brian Blake in the comics and novels) is a fictional character and a primary antagonist from \"The Walking Dead\" comic book and television series. On television, he is portrayed by David Morrissey. Created by Robert Kirkman and artists Charlie Adlard and Cliff Rathburn, the character made his comics debut in \"The Walking Dead\" #27 on April 2006 and his television debut in season 3. In both series, The Governor is the ruthless, charismatic leader of the town of Woodbury, Georgia who comes into conflict with protagonist Rick Grimes and is responsible for the deaths of several primary characters. The Governor's origins are explored in the novel \"\", written by Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga.\n\nIn the television series, The Governor's disturbing motives are reflected in his authoritarian ways in dealing with threats to his community, primarily by executing most large groups and only accepting lone survivors into his community. His dark nature escalates when he comes into conflict with Rick Grimes and the latter's group, who are occupying the nearby prison. The Governor vows to eliminate the prison group, and in that pursuit, he leaves several key characters dead both in Rick's group and his own. The Governor has a romantic relationship with Andrea, who unsuccessfully seeks to broker a truce between the two groups. In season 4, The Governor attempts to redeem himself upon meeting a new family, to whom he introduces himself as Brian Heriot. However, he commits several brutal acts to ensure the family's survival. This leads to more characters' deaths and forces Rick and his group to abandon the prison.\n\nIn 2009, the Governor was ranked as IGN's 86th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time and was ranked #28 on \"TV Guide\"s list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time. For his performance as the Governor, Morrissey was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 39th Saturn Awards.\n\nAside from simply \"The Governor,\" the character's name appeared to be Philip Blake; however, with the release of the novel \"\", it was revealed that his actual name was Brian Blake, and Philip was revealed to be his deceased brother.\n\nWhen the dead began to rise, Brian and Philip gathered a small group, which included Brian's niece Penny, and the group were constantly on the run when unsecured locations were breached; the planned community called the Wiltshire Estates, where Rick's group coincidentally stayed, was one of these. Eventually, Brian's group came upon Woodbury, Georgia, a ravaged town being led by a group of National Guardsmen under Major Gene Gavin, who used fear to assert his authority. After becoming the last of his group, Brian rallied the townspeople against Gavin and the Guardsmen and afterward declared himself \"Governor\" of the four blocks making up the settlement. Initially appearing to be a fair and strong leader, he became increasingly more ruthless and power-hungry. He kept the zombified Penny tied up in his apartment, feeding her severed body parts of those who displeased him.\n\nFollowing Woodbury's capture and the murder of stranded refugees from Atlanta, The Governor is met by Rick Grimes, when Grimes' band of survivors explores the town. After initially acting hospitable, The Governor turns on the group. Attempting to find the location of Rick's prison refuge in order to collect supplies for Woodbury, The Governor proceeds to cut off Rick's hand, torture Glenn, and rape and torture Michonne. To learn the location of the prison, the Governor allows the survivors to escape the premises with the help of one of his guards, Caesar Martinez. However, Michonne stays behind and finds her way to The Governor's apartment, where she brutally tortures him, severing his right arm, fingernails, penis, and left eye. When Michonne rejoins the group and they ask her if The Governor is still alive, Michonne is uncertain. The Governor survives with the help of Bob Stookey, a citizen who had medical experience, and is eventually able to find the prison. The Governor uses Rick's murder of Martinez to rally Woodbury's townspeople against the prison's inhabitants. Things do not go according to plan, however, as Rick's group puts up a tenacious defense that forces Woodbury's humiliating retreat. After a failed attempt to gain his way into the prison, by using Tyreese as a hostage and subsequently decapitating him with Michonne's katana, The Governor crushes the fences with a tank. A bloody massacre ensues, leading to a high death toll and ultimately making the prison less secure and less habitable.\n\nTensions steadily rise within The Governor's group, as their remaining ammunition is limited, and a handful of Woodbury residents' moral consciences come into play, especially regarding the killing of defenseless or young members of the prison group. Both factors lead to the remnants of The Governor's army turning on him, and to Lilly's killing him, throwing his corpse to the zombies, and making a last-ditch attempt to fortify the prison.\n\nBefore the outbreak, Philip and Brian Blake were raised by an abusive father. As an adult, Philip worked an office job with a boss he didn't get along with, was married, and had a daughter named Penny. Eighteen months before the outbreak, Philip lost his wife in a car accident. During the early days of the outbreak, Philip and Penny survived and found a community in Woodbury. Penny was bitten, however, and turned into a zombie. Unable to accept her death, Philip locked her up in a private room in his office. When the community was leaderless, they picked Philip to lead and began calling him \"The Governor\", a nickname which stuck. Determined not to lose the community, he executed any outsider groups he saw as a threat. He allowed some smaller groups to move into Woodbury if he deemed them to be an asset and not a threat to his leadership, but still took precautions and had them monitored by his lieutenants until he deemed them trustworthy. At some point during the first and second season The Governor encounters a dying Merle Dixon, whom The Governor enlisted, along with Caesar Martinez and Milton Mamet, as his lieutenant and advisers. He also tasks Milton, a scientist, with researching a means to reverse the virus in the hopes of saving Penny. The Governor was also known to have had affairs with many of the Woodbury women.\n\nThe Governor is charming and charismatic, but also murderous, violent, sociopathic, power-hungry, completely sadistic, and horrifically ruthless. He sees himself as the community's only hope for survival, and is thus willing to imprison, abuse and/or kill anyone he sees as a threat to his authority; for him, torture and mass murder are a means to an end. One example of this is when he and his men massacre a group of National Guardsmen, take their supplies. Later, he is proven to be completely cruel, heartless, and aggressive, willingly decapitating Hershel Greene with not even a single shred of remorse or mercy, even when Rick offers to make peace between the two factions, and ordering his men to kill Rick and his survivor group after mercilessly killing a little girl when she was bitten by a walker and dying.\n\nThe Governor first appears in \"Walk with Me\", season 3, episode 3, having forcibly taken Andrea and Michonne from the woods after Merle discovers them near a downed military helicopter. Woodbury, under The Governor's rule, is a functioning community that even bears some resemblance to the world before the virus struck. The townspeople are unaware that the Governor and his men massacred a platoon of National Guardsmen to get their supplies. In the episode \"Killer Within\", The Governor befriends Andrea, and he reveals some of his past to her, including his real name. In the episode \"Say the Word\", it is shown that The Governor has a zombified daughter named Penny, whom he keeps hidden, feeds body parts to, and grooms affectionately while playing the lullaby \"Bye, baby Bunting\". The Governor allows Michonne to leave town, but she is unable to convince Andrea to leave with her. The Governor leads Andrea to a gathering for the townsfolk: a sparring match between Merle and Martinez surrounded by chained, toothless walkers. The spectacle shocks Andrea, who describes it as \"barbaric\", but the Governor insists it is \"fun\", and it teaches the residents to not be afraid. In the episode \"Hounded\", the Governor and Andrea begin a sexual relationship.\n\nHe sends Merle to find and kill Michonne, and although Merle fails to kill her, he returns with two captives, Glenn Rhee and Maggie Greene. In the episode \"When the Dead Come Knocking\", the Governor interrogates Maggie and eventually sexually assaults her, and leaves Glenn to be brutalized by Merle. When he threatens to shoot Glenn, Maggie gives The Governor the information about the prison and their group. In the mid-season finale \"Made to Suffer\", during Rick Grimes' foray into Woodbury to rescue Glenn and Maggie, Michonne kills Penny. Enraged, the Governor attacks Michonne, and in self-defense she stabs him in the hand and the right eye with a glass shard. The Governor calls a town meeting, where he claims the town has been attacked by terrorists brought by Merle, and he brings forth Merle's brother Daryl Dixon in chains. The Governor orders them to fight to the death, and the town calls for their blood as a way to force the two brothers to fight each other.\n\nIn the mid-season premiere \"The Suicide King\", the fight between Merle and Daryl is broken up when the prison group attacks, allowing the brothers to escape. The Governor withdraws to his apartment, and the town is in a state of unrest after the attack. Andrea confronts him about her friends' presence in town, and then goes out to calm and inspire the townspeople. In the episode \"Home\", The Governor asks Milton Mamet where his loyalties lie, and asks him to keep tabs on Andrea. The Governor and his men then attack the prison; Rick Grimes' group runs for cover, and gunfire erupts on both sides. When a herd of walkers charge through town, the Governor gleefully sprays machine gun fire in the air and then drives off as the survivors struggle with the walkers.\n\nIn the episode \"I Ain't a Judas\", the Governor proceeds to rally Woodbury against the prison survivors, labeling them terrorists and raiders. Andrea wants to leave to negotiate peace with the prison group, but the Governor discourages her, implying that she will not be welcomed back if she leaves. When Milton tells the Governor that Andrea asked him to help her sneak out, the Governor tells him to go with her. The Governor welcomes Tyreese, Sasha, Allen, and Ben to Woodbury, after Rick kicked them out of the prison. Andrea returns to Woodbury and warily resumes her place at the Governor's side. In the episode \"Arrow on the Doorpost\", encouraged by Andrea, the Governor meets with Rick in a secluded grain silo to offer him peace in exchange for turning over Michonne, giving him two days to think about it. The Governor returns to Woodbury and secretly orders Martinez to set an ambush at the barn, to kill all of Rick's group and bring Michonne to Woodbury so The Governor can torture her. In the episode \"Prey\", Andrea flees for the prison, and the Governor hunts her down personally, bringing her back to Woodbury and strapping her in the dentist's chair that he meant to use on Michonne. In the episode \"This Sorrowful Life\", Merle kidnaps Michonne at Rick's suggestion to turn her over to the Governor, but lets her go and instead lures walkers to the Governor's meeting place to ambush the Woodbury army. Then, the Governor maims, shoots, and kills Merle, leaving his body to reanimate as a walker, which Daryl later kills, out of pure anger, remorse, and pain.\n\nIn the season finale \"Welcome to the Tombs\", the Governor brutally beats Milton up after learning that he burned the walkers that the Governor had been corralling; he then orders him to kill Andrea. Milton tries in vain to kill the Governor, but the Governor stabs him and locks him in with Andrea, so that Milton will reanimate and kill Andrea. The Governor then leads his army into the prison to kill Rick's entire group, but Tyreese and Sasha wants nothing to do with it, and stay behind at Woodbury. Rick and the others have set a trap at the prison, expecting the Woodbury army's arrival. Ambushed and outgunned by Maggie and Glenn, the Governor's army flees the prison in terror. The Governor stops the fast-fleeing convoy, and, in response to their protests against returning to the prison, he opens fire and slaughters them all, sparing only Martinez and Shumpert, his two primary henchmen. Only Karen escapes his rampage (by playing dead under a corpse). The Governor, Martinez, and Shumpert are last seen driving off as Rick and Tyreese bring everyone from Woodbury to the prison, and leave Woodbury to be overrun.\n\n\"Live Bait\" reveals that, just after massacring his own people, the Governor sets up camp with Martinez and Shumpert. Martinez and Shumpert abandon him after he does nothing to protect himself from a walker, believing him to have lost his nerve. The next day the Governor drives back to Woodbury, which is overrun with walkers, and burns down the entire town. After several months alone, intentionally trying to let the walkers kill him, he finally collapses on the street. He looks up to see a young girl, about the same age as Penny, in the window of a nearby apartment building; he pulls himself back to his feet and investigates. He finds the Chambler family residing inside, consisting of sisters Lilly and Tara, their father David, and Lilly's daughter Meghan. Lilly and Tara initially hold the Governor at gunpoint, but they later confiscate his pistol and allow him to stay in an apartment across the hallway. After hearing about how the Governor has survived the last few months, they ask him his name. He tells them that it is \"Brian Heriot\", a name he saw painted on the side of a barn while staggering aimlessly through the countryside. He runs some errands for the family, and risks his life to get David two oxygen tanks from a walker-infested nursing home. When David dies and reanimates, the Governor saves the rest of the family by bashing in David's head with one of the oxygen tanks. After he buries David, he burns his photo of his wife and Penny. That night, he goes to the Chamblers to say goodbye, but Lilly insists that he stay. He and Lilly become lovers, and he saves Meghan when she falls into a pit of walkers, killing them with his bare hands. Moments later, he encounters Martinez and his group.\n\nIn the episode \"Dead Weight\", Martinez takes in the Governor, accepting his new facade as \"Brian\", and the girls and lets them join their camp. Among the camp are brothers Pete and Mitch Dolgen, who have a working tank. When it becomes clear that Martinez may not be able to keep them safe, the Governor kills him by throwing him into a pit of walkers. Pete takes command, but the Governor later kills him as well after he displays an inability to kill a group of other survivors to take their belongings. The Governor plans to rally the camp and use the tank in a second attack on the prison.\n\nIn the mid-season finale \"Too Far Gone\", the Governor encounters Michonne and Hershel Greene, and takes them hostage, intending to use them as leverage over Rick. The Governor then rallies the camp to take over the prison. Upon arriving at the prison with his army and tank, the Governor tells Rick that he is going to give their group a chance to leave without anyone getting killed. Rick says that they can co-exist peacefully, but the Governor calls him a liar and beheads Hershel. During the ensuing gunfight, Lilly arrives in time to see him murder Hershel. She is carrying Meghan, who has been bitten by a walker. He dispassionately shoots Meghan to prevent her from becoming a walker before ordering his people to kill everyone in the prison. The Governor uses the tank to roll over the fences and goes into the fight himself, only to be tackled by Rick. The two of them fight, and the Governor eventually pins Rick and brutally beats him before beginning to choke him to death. At that moment, Michonne stabs the Governor and leaves him to die. Lilly then shoots him in the head, killing him. His corpse is briefly visible at the beginning of \"After,\" lying in the middle of the field with a bullet hole in his head.\n\nIn the mid-season premiere \"What Happened and What's Going On\", the Governor appears, along with Beth Greene, Bob Stookey, Martin, and Lizzie and Mika Samuels, during Tyreese's hallucinations after Tyreese is bitten by a walker. While Beth, Bob, and the girls comfort Tyreese, the Governor taunts him about his past actions and inability to do what is \"necessary\". The Governor, especially, criticizes Tyreese's choices, particularly in forgiving Carol for murdering Karen. The Governor reminds Tyreese that he promised to do what it took to earn his keep, but he failed to adapt. However, Tyreese stands up and confronts him. However The Governor \"pushes\" Tyreese to the ground while still pressing his point. Tyreese ultimately dies in peace, and the vision of the Governor fades away.\n\nOn television, the character is portrayed by British actor David Morrissey. Glen Mazzara, when asked about the character's direction for season 3 of the show, described The Governor as a narcissist, who sees himself as the future savior of civilization and is willing to resort to the most extreme of measures to achieve his ultimate goal.\n\nDespite making few appearances, The Governor's daughter, Penny, plays a key role in his mentality and actions. He secretly cares for the undead Penny in his apartment, as revealed in the episode \"Say the Word\", brushing her hair and singing to her, and tells Michonne that she does not need to suffer, implying that he believes Penny is still alive and is \"under the grip of a terrible, terrible illness\".\n\nThe Governor's eye patch in the television series was placed on the opposite side from that of his comic book counterpart.\n\nIn 2009, the Governor was ranked as IGN's 86th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time and was ranked #28 on TV Guide's list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time. David Morrissey has been well received for his performance as the Governor, and was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 39th Saturn Awards.\n"}

He is notable for having held the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship five times. McDaniel was a major star in prominent National Wrestling Alliance affiliated promotions such as Championship Wrestling from Florida, Georgia Championship Wrestling, NWA Big Time Wrestling (which would eventually be renamed World Class Championship Wrestling) and Jim Crockett Promotions (which would ultimately become WCW after being purchased by media mogul Ted Turner in 1988).\n\nWahoo was born in the small town of Bernice, Louisiana in 1938. His father worked in oil and he moved to several towns before settling down in Midland, Texas while Wahoo was in middle school. One of his baseball coaches was George H. W. Bush. The name \"Wahoo\" actually came from his father who was known as \"Big Wahoo\". He was a problematic teenager but he was accepted to the University of Oklahoma. There he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and he was also a part of Bud Wilkinson's Sooners football program.\n\nMcDaniel's college career was somewhat marred by injuries early on but by his senior year, he was one of the top players on the Oklahoma team despite being caught drinking after games and skipping classes. He played linebacker for the American Football League's Houston Oilers and Denver Broncos but really became a star when he was traded to the New York Jets in 1964. He was a crowd favorite and made 23 tackles in a single game against his former Denver Broncos. As a gimmick, whenever McDaniel made a tackle, the PA announcer would announce, \"Tackle made by...guess who?\", which the crowd would respond, \"WAHOO!\" He was picked by the Miami Dolphins in the 1966 American Football League expansion draft, as the team's major name player. During the 1968 season, he knocked out two police officers in an altercation and was traded to the San Diego Chargers. Wahoo never played a game for San Diego and started wrestling full-time. McDaniel was unique in that he wore his nickname of \"Wahoo\" as the name on his jersey.\n\nWahoo wrestled during the off-season, a common practice at the time due to low player salaries, for Dory Funk in Amarillo, Texas while he played for Houston and Denver. When he was playing for the New York Jets, Vince McMahon, Sr. brought him in for a run in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). During his run, he wrestled with stars like Boris Malenko, Cowboy Bill Watts, Dr. Jerry Graham and Waldo Von Erich. When he played in Miami, Eddie Graham booked him and used him as a tag team wrestler with Jose Lothario. His Madison Square Garden debut was January 25, 1965, where he defeated Boris Malenko. Malenko at the time was essentially a preliminary wrestler. Nonetheless, the match got some strong local media coverage due to McDaniel's football career.\n\nAfter leaving football, Wahoo wrestled some in Hawaii but really made his mark and had his greatest success in Houston. He feuded with Boris Malenko, eventually winning his hair, and was a frequent challenger for Dory Funk, Jr.'s NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The feud sold out the Sam Houston Coliseum on several occasions with Wahoo going time limit draws with the champ but ultimately coming up short. After Houston, he went to the American Wrestling Association and had a very successful feud with Superstar Billy Graham after Graham could not defeat Wahoo in an arm wrestling challenge and attacked him. Eventually, the feud turned into a tag feud with Wahoo teaming with the Crusher (another legitimate tough guy) against Graham and Ivan Koloff.\n\nIn 1974, Wahoo came to Mid-Atlantic to wrestle for Jim Crockett Promotions and help build up the territory as a singles territory in a feud with a rival from Texas, Johnny Valentine. The feud evolved into a tag feud with Wahoo and Paul Jones taking on Johnny Valentine and Ric Flair, who Wahoo met in the AWA.\n\nMcDaniel and John Valentine went on to have a feud remembered to this day for the sheer force of their punch/chop exchanges, both men widely known for their hard-hitting style. Wahoo won the Mid-Atlantic title from Valentine on June 29, 1975, in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nMcDaniel and Flair entered into a legendary feud over the Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship title throughout 1975 and 1976 after Johnny Valentine's career was ended in a plane crash. Flair won the title for the first time on September 20, 1975, in Hampton, Virginia. Wahoo regained the title in the Charlotte (NC) Coliseum in May of the following year.\n\nFlair regained the title three weeks later in a match remembered as the \"table leg\" match. Wahoo and Flair shattered a table at ringside, and Flair picked up one of table legs to hit Wahoo in the head, not realizing a nail was sticking out of the table leg. McDaniel was legitimately injured and the match quickly ended with Flair pinning McDaniel for the title.\n\nMcDaniel and Flair would swap the title one more time before the final exchange of the Mid-Atlantic title between the two happened on December 27, 1976, when Wahoo defeated Flair for the belt in a \"No Disqualification\" match in the Richmond (VA) Coliseum. Flair went on to win the United States title and matches for the U.S. belt between Wahoo and Flair drew huge houses, with Flair holding on to the championship.\n\nIn 1977, Johnny Valentine's son Greg Valentine attacked Wahoo and broke his leg in an angle to establish Greg as Johnny's successor. Greg Valentine originally won the title on June 11, 1977, with Wahoo regaining it in Raleigh, NC two months later. On September 7, 1977, Greg Valentine regained the title at the WRAL-TV studio tapings, breaking Wahoo's leg in the process. This angle is particularly remembered for a follow-up interview weeks later with Flair and Valentine throwing change at Wahoo, and Valentine asking Wahoo if he needed a custom-made wheelchair for his fat body. Valentine then infuriated fans (thus building up the demand for a rematch) by parading around in T-shirts which read \"I Broke Wahoo's Leg\" and \"No More Wahoo.\"\n\nWahoo won the Mid-Atlantic title for the final time in a match against Valentine in Greensboro, NC on April 2, 1978. Unusually enough for that decade, the title reign lasted only a week, with Wahoo dropping the title to Olympic weightlifter Ken Patera in Charlotte, NC.\n\nOther than his work in Mid-Atlantic, he wrestled in Florida, usually against then NWA World champion Harley Race. He also split his time wrestling in Georgia and the AWA. He went to Japan several times but never really caught on although he did wrestle major names like Giant Baba, Antonio Inoki and Jumbo Tsuruta. By 1980, he was wrestling in San Antonio in a feud with Tully Blanchard and his regular tag partner, \"Georgous\" Gino Hernandez. When the promoter in Houston broke away from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and recognized the AWA World champion Nick Bockwinkel, Wahoo was the regular challenger.\n\nHe returned to Mid-Atlantic in 1981 and feuded with Roddy Piper over the United States title which ended when Piper brought in Abdullah the Butcher and Abby put Wahoo out on injury. Wahoo returned and had another bloody feud with Sgt. Slaughter for the U.S. title when Slaughter won the title while Wahoo was injured. In 1984, he turned on Ricky Steamboat, taking the U.S. title for the fourth time when Tully Blanchard came to Wahoo's assistance with a steel chair. He was stripped of the title but regained it in a tournament later that year. Wahoo successfully defended it at Starrcade of that year against Billy Graham but lost it to Magnum T.A. in early 1985 in a steel cage match. Wahoo feuded again with the now babyface Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight title at various times before Flair turned heel again. After losing the U.S. title, he booked and wrestled mostly for Championship Wrestling from Florida. While there. he assaulted a fan that called his headdress \"chicken feathers\" during a TV taping at the Sportatorium. He made a tag team with Billy Jack Haynes which won the promotion's version of the NWA United States Tag Team title from Rick Rude and Jesse Barr (aka Jimmy Jack Funk). Wahoo wrestled some high-profile matches in Florida like an unsuccessful world title bid against Ric Flair and a draw against Bruiser Brody at the Florida promotion's nationally syndicated big show, \"Battle of the Belts\".\n\nIn 1986, he returned as a face to Mid-Atlantic wrestling in some of his famous Indian Strap Matches with Jimmy Garvin and Rick Rude. He won the NWA National Heavyweight Championship from Tully Blanchard in front of a packed house of 11,000 fans in Los Angeles at The Forum (Inglewood, California) on August 28, 1986 during a wild and bloody match, but lost a unification match against NWA U.S. champion Nikita Koloff.\n\nFor the rest of the 1980s, he wrestled mainly for the AWA and for WWC in Puerto Rico. He was a perennial top contender for the AWA World Title from 1987–1989, challenging Curt Hennig, Jerry Lawler, and Larry Zbyszko during that time. McDaniel initially retired following a match against Mike Enos and Wayne Bloom, where he suffered a detached retina.\n\nBut his retirement was brief and he returned to wrestling the following year. He continued to wrestle into the 1990s mostly for independent promotions throughout the south. In 1993, he teamed with Jim Brunzell and Blackjack Mulligan against Don Muraco, Jimmy Snuka, and Dick Murdoch in a legends match at the inaugural Slamboree: A Legend's Reunion. The following year, he participated in an angle where he and Chief Jay Strongbow supposedly passed the torch to WWF's Tatanka. Had a notable feud on the indie circuit with Ivan Koloff and a series of matches with an unknown wrestler named Mean Marc Ash, which signaled to many long time observers that Wahoo's career was nearly over. He wrestled until 1996 when he officially retired.\nWahoo is often compared to Chief Jay Strongbow, who played a Native American wrestler at the time. Wahoo was respected by other wrestlers and football players for his toughness, physical style and his crazy antics outside of the ring. The respect as a legitimate athlete made it easy for him to go to different territories and be successful when many babyfaces had trouble doing so. Although his playing ability in football is often overshadowed by his wild lifestyle. Joe Namath and Larry Csonka, who played with him early in their careers, both printed stories about him in their autobiographies.

He was sentenced to eight years in federal prison on conspiracy charges and ordered to pay $3.5 million in restitution. His lawyers, however, have appealed the verdict and sentence.\nHe was released August 16, 2011.\n\nCottrell graduated from the University of Chicago. After graduating, he was accepted to the graduate physics program at Caltech, where he would meet Tyler Johnson, who was also studying physics and finishing up his undergraduate work.\n\nIn August 2003, Cottrell and Tyler Johnson developed a plan to place bumper stickers on SUVs reading \"SUV = TERRORISM.\" In a series of emails that were later recovered by the FBI, Cottrell attempted to recruit friends to help him purchase the bumper stickers, and organised arson attacks on a series of Hummer dealers.\n\nHe was arrested in March 2004 after law enforcement tracked him sending emails to the \"Los Angeles Times.\" The e-mails signed by \"Tony Marsden\" speak about what the ELF cell had done, vandalizing more than 130 SUVs parked at dealerships or residential homes, claiming they were damaging the environment. He was charged with conspiracy to commit arson, arson, and one count of using a destructive device during a crime of violence, in an October 24, 2004 Federal grand jury indictment. Cottrell's lawyers stated that he was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. However, Judge Gary Klausner would not allow a defense based upon the claim that Cottrell was suffering from Asperger syndrome.\n\nAt his trial, Cottrell admitted being present, but denied involvement in throwing Molotov cocktails, saying Johnson was the mastermind.\n\nAn informal network of Cottrell supporters formed, led by the Earth Liberation Front Prisoner's Network and the Free Billy Cottrell organization. These supporters claimed that Cottrell was the innocent victim of government persecution. However, when Cottrell named Johnson as the mastermind, it prompted his Free Billy Cottrell supporters to brand him as a traitor, issue an apology to those who supported Cottrell, and end all support.\n\nAn article in the \"LA Weekly\" reports that Billy was being mistreated by prison guards who have labeled him a \"terrorist\". According to the article, he is not permitted to study physics or Mandarin Chinese, is not permitted to teach the other prisoners calculus, and had had his books and papers removed without being given a reason.\n\nA letter in Cottrell's defense, signed by Stephen Hawking and other prominent scientists, was distributed to prison authorities and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals at Cottrell's October 18, 2006 hearing. He was then transferred into another federal prison with less violent prisoners. Cottrell was then able to study subjects that he was denied at the last prison and no longer had a roommate.\n\nA documentary film on Cottrell, titled \"Standard Deviation\", was written and directed by David Randag and Chris Brannan in 2008. In 2009, it won the Emmy for best student documentary at the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation's 30th College Television Awards.\n\nOn 8 September 2009, Cottrell's convictions and sentences for arson were overturned by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the conspiracy conviction and sentence were affirmed. According to the \"Times\", the omission of Cottrell's diagnosis of Asperger syndrome during his 2004 trial played a key role in the decision. Cottrell was released on August 16, 2011.\n"}
