Popularly known as the \"Master of Suspense\" for his use of innovative film techniques in thrillers, Hitchcock started his career in the British film industry as a title designer and art director for a number of silent films during the early 1920s, most of which are now lost. His directorial debut was the 1925 release \"The Pleasure Garden\". Hitchcock followed this with \"\", his first commercial and critical success. It featured many of the thematic elements his films would be known for such as an innocent man on the run. It also featured the first of his famous cameo appearances. Two years later he directed \"Blackmail\" (1929) which was his first sound film. In 1935 Hitchcock directed \"The 39 Steps\". Three years later he directed \"The Lady Vanishes,\" starring Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave.\n\nHitchcock's British films – and many of his early American ones – are often mistakenly believed to be in the public domain. In fact, all of his films are under copyright in the US and UK. Nonetheless, bootlegs of his work continue to be widely disseminated.\n\nIn 1940, Hitchcock transitioned to Hollywood productions, the first of which was the psychological thriller \"Rebecca\" starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. He received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won Best Picture. Hitchcock worked with Fontaine again the following year on the film \"Suspicion\" which also starred Cary Grant. In 1943, Hitchcock directed another psychological thriller \"Shadow of a Doubt\" which starred Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten. Three years later he reunited with Grant on \"Notorious\" which also starred Ingrid Bergman. The film included a three-minute intermittent kissing scene between the leads shot specifically to skirt the Motion Picture Production Code which at the time limited such scenes to three seconds. In 1948, Hitchcock directed \"Rope\" which starred James Stewart. The film was his first in Technicolor and is remembered for its use of long takes to make the film appear to be a single continuous shot. Three years later he directed \"Strangers on a Train\" (1951).\n\nHitchcock collaborated with Grace Kelly on three films: \"Dial M for Murder\" (1954), \"Rear Window\" (1954) and \"To Catch a Thief\" (1955). For \"Rear Window\", Hitchcock received a nomination for Best Director at the Academy Awards. 1955 marked his debut on television as the host of the anthology television series \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" which he also produced. In 1958, Hitchcock directed the psychological thriller \"Vertigo\" starring Stewart and Kim Novak. The film topped the 2012 poll of the British film magazine \"Sight & Sound\" of the 50 Greatest Films of All Time and also topped the American Film Institute's Top Ten in the mystery genre. He followed this with the spy thriller \"North by Northwest\" (1959) which starred Grant and Eva Marie Saint. In 1960, he directed \"Psycho\", the biggest commercial success of his career and for which he received his fifth nomination for Best Director at the Academy Awards. Three years later he directed horror film \"The Birds\" starring Tippi Hedren. The following year he reunited with Hedren on the film \"Marnie\" which also starred Sean Connery.\n\nIn recognition of his career, Hitchcock garnered the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Fellowship Award, the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, the Directors Guild of America's Lifetime Achievement Award and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award. He received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame to acknowledge his film and television achievements. In 1980, Hitchcock received a knighthood.\n\n"}

{"id": "13402378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13402378", "title": "Bibi Blocksberg", "text": "Bibi Blocksberg\n\nBibi Blocksberg is a German audio drama series for children, created in 1980 by Elfie Donnelly. The main character is a girl called Bibi Blocksberg, who is a witch. As of winter 2009, there have been 95 episodes. The title of the series was \"Eene meene Hexerei\". This title was used for the first seven episodes, after which the series was renamed to \"Bibi Blocksberg\". The first episodes were later released under the new title and with a new cover. The old episodes are very sought after among collectors. The length of the episodes originally varied between 35 and 40 minutes and nowadays between 40 and 45 minutes. An exception is episode #78 with a length of 52 minutes. Bibi's popularity during this era led to her becoming the official mascot of Kiddinx.\n\nIn the series, Bibi, who is fond of playing practical jokes, experiences numerous adventures with her friends. Magic often plays a major part, and often leads to trouble, and Bibi's mother, who is also a witch, must come to set things straight. Bibi's antagonist is often the mayor of Neustadt, who is presented as lazy and incompetent. This leads to conflict with the helpful Bibi.\n\nThe surname of Bibi is a reference to the old name of the Brocken, a mountain in Saxony-Anhalt in its native Germany that is traditionally connected with witches (\"Walpurgis Night\"), most famously in Goethe's \"Faust\".\n\nThe series was adapted into an animated series in 1995. 11 years later, in 2006, it was given an English dub produced by Ocean Productions and recorded at Blue Water Studios.\n\nBrigitte \"Bibi\" Blocksberg is a 13-year-old witch girl who has blonde hair tied to a pony tail with a red bow and wears a green dress (green is her favourite colour) and white socks. Bibi likes to use her magical powers to play practical jokes. Not only the mayor, but also the school principal, the teachers and many other people of Neustadt fall victim to her jokes. Her favourite mode of transport is her broomstick \"Kartoffelbrei\" (\"mashed potato\" or \"apple pie\" in the English dub) which she can make fly by chanting spell rhymes, such as \"Eene meene Mei, Kartoffelbrei mein Flugzeug sei\", \"Eene meene Mei, flieg los Kartoffelbrei\" or \"Eeene meene Schmieg, Kartoffelbrei los, flieg\". Often, the journalist Karla Kolumna reports her jokes and adventures. Apart from her tendency to make jokes, Bibi has a big heart. She rescues the townspeople in many episodes, tries to help her friends and is opposed to injustice in the world.\n\nBernhard and Barbara Blocksberg are Bibi's parents. Barbara is also a witch, and flies to the Walburgisnacht every year on her broomstick \"Baldrian\" (\"Baldrian\", \"Valerian\" in English, is a common sleeping draught). In the first episodes, her eccentric cooking is a source of annoyance for her family. Barbara insists on cooking witches' food with ingredients such as spiders and frogs, even though no member of her family likes it. Once, she admits that she doesn't even like the food herself, but merely tries to uphold old witch traditions. When Barbara is tired of her family, she flies to visit her friend Amanda. She has a witch's laboratory, in which she often makes foul-smelling magical potions and experiments with various herbs. She feels responsible for upholding a \"normal\" life in her household and has thus set many rules in the Blocksberg house (for example no flying in through the window, no flying to school on the broomstick, use magic only in an emergency), but these rules are often broken. She frequently reminds her daughter of the witches' honour code, which for example forbids conjuring up money. Like many other adult witches, Barbara is a member of the \"Hexenrat\" (witches' council).\n\nBernhard Blocksberg has no magic powers, as these are exclusive to women. He would like to have a normal family, which he mentions in nearly every episode. He often forbids Barbara and Bibi to use magic, but they never listen to him. However, he is proud of \"his\" witches. He has a habit of reading the town newspaper every morning. Although Bernhard and Barbara often have arguments, which sometimes escalate to divorce threats, they love each other and in some later episodes go on romantic cruises, for example to Venice.\n\nThe first seven episodes also feature Bibi's little brother Boris. He is often very jealous of Bibi's magical powers, which leads to many arguments between them. According to episode #1, he is eight years old. In episode #9, he moves to his grandparents' house at the North Sea. The reason that is given is that he has a cough and needs fresh sea air. He is never mentioned again and doesn't return to his parents and sister, not even on important occasions, such as when the Blocksbergs are moving into a new house.\n\nMoni (Monika) is Bibi's best friend. She first appears in episode #10 \"Bibis neue Freundin\" (\"Bibi's new friend\"), when she comes to Bibi's class. Originally, she was unpopular. She often was unfriendly to her classmates. Because of her old-fashioned clothes and the fact that she used to live in a small village, she was called a \"Landpomeranze\" (derogatory term used for a girl from the countryside). Only when Bibi found out that Moni has trouble with her very strict parents, she decided to help her, and they have been good friends since.\n\nMarita is Bibi's best friend in later episodes. Bibi meets her in episode #19. Marita is a lot more self-confident than Bibi's other friend, Moni. Even though they sometimes have arguments, Bibi and Marita remain close friends. Marita appears often in later episodes and has many exciting adventures with Bibi.\n\nFlorian is one of Bibi's best friends and a computer guru. In later episodes, he also became a fan of Sherlock Holmes. He has helped Bibi raise a dinosaur and was present during many other adventures, which would often involve him looking up things on his computer. Bibi and the others often call him \"Flori\". It is sometimes implied that Bibi's friend Moni might have a crush on Florian.\n\nThe Mayor's name is Bruno Pressak (\"Pressack\" is a type of German sausage, as well as a derogatory term for a corpulent person), but he is nearly always referred to as \"The Mayor\". He often makes many good promises, but his motive is always only money. He refers to Bibi as \"Bibi Blocksbergi\". This is due to the fact that in episode #3 \"Die Zauberlimonade\" (\"The magic lemonade\"), Bibi made him drink magic lemonade that forced him to add an \"i\" to every word he said. He has kept the habit ever since whenever he meets Bibi. He is dominant and rude to his secretary Pichler. He loves food and is portrayed as overweight. He is sometimes presented as megalomanic. In episode #64 \"Die neue Schule\" (\"The new school\"), for instance, he orders a new city hall to be built in the shape of a castle, and in episode #63 \"Die Wahrsagerin\" (\"The fortune-teller\"), he visits a fortune-teller, who tells him he is going to be King of Neustadt, which causes him to order a regal robe and sceptre. He often appears a bit stupid and gullible, and his character is defined by a lust for profit and a habit of emphasising his own importance. However, he is never cruel. He has a good heart hidden deep inside of him.\n\nKarla is a reporter, who is always looking for a big story. She is good friends with the Blocksberg family and often helps them. She often rides a motorcycle on her job. Her notable attributes are her high-pitched, shrill voice and loud laugh, her habit of talking very quickly and her catchphrase \"Sensationell!\". She sometimes refers to the Mayor as her \"dearest (or favourite) enemy\". She enjoys presenting him as greedy. Karla also appears in the radio drama series \"Benjamin Blümchen\" and the Bibi Blocksberg spin-off, Bibi und Tina. She is known as \"Carla Caramba\" in the English dub.\n\nFlauipaui is a young witch who is friends with Bibi and Schubia. She is obsessed with her appearance, often combing her long hair and looking at herself in the mirror. She is very easily scared. She is afraid of her magic teacher Tante Mania, because she never understands her homework. However, she can be very brave in dangerous situations. She goes to magic school with Schubia Wanzhaar and Bibi Blocksberg. Her broomstick is called \"Gänseblümchen\" (\"Daisy\").\n\nSchubia Wanzhaar is a young punk witch. She attends magic school with Bibi and Flauipaui. She has green hair and a motor broomstick called \"Kawakasi\" (probably a pun on the motorcycle manufacturer Kawasaki). She often has problems with her magic teacher Tante Mania because she's inattentive. She is overconfident, but is good friends with Bibi and Flaupaui, whom she often teases. She appears tough, but has a soft heart. She wears punk clothes and always wears deep red lipstick.\n\nEven though Bibi refers to her as \"Tante\" (aunt), Amanda is not actually related to the Blocksbergs. She is a friend of Barbara's, who doesn't only have magical powers as well, but also shares her passion for witchcraft. In episode #77, it is revealed that she is the chairwoman of the witches' council's progressive wing.\n\nMania is the oldest witch in and a foundation member of the witches' council. In early episodes, she is portrayed as the typical evil witch of fairy tales, with a strong dislike for other people. In episode #35, she even conjures up eternal winter, only to spite her fellow witches. In later episodes, she is shown as friendlier, but still very strict and set in her own ways. She becomes the teacher of the young witches Bibi, Flauipaui and Schubia. She doesn't care much for Flauipaui and Schubia, but she likes Bibi's kindness and her good heart, as well as her talent in witchcraft. Mania owns several cats, owls and a black raven named Abraxas (which is also the name of \"The Little Witch\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s raven <nowiki>[</nowiki>Otfried Preußler<nowiki>]</nowiki>), whom she uses to send messages, as well as to keep her company.\n\nWalpurgia is the head of the witches' council. She is very strict and insists on rules to be followed. In addition to her position in the witches' council, she runs a boarding school for young witches, to which Bibi, Flauipaui and Schubia are sent temporarily in episode #77.\n\nCecily Thunderstorm is Bibi's aunt from Ireland and also a witch. She first appears in episode #8, and afterwards in episodes #36 and #82. She is married to Patrick Thunderstorm, who, like Bernard Blocksberg, has no magic powers. Patrick owns a flying car, which has been enchanted by his wife. Their daughter Margie first had problems with Bibi, but when Bibi learned of the castle's financial problems, she helped Margie and they became friends. The two girls have stayed in touch since. Despite the fact that the Thuderstorms are Irish, they always speak German, even among themselves. Only occasionally do they use English terms or phrases, such as \"darling\" or \"Oh yeah!\".\n\nThere have been two films about Bibi Blocksberg:\nThere is also an animated series with 52 episodes, but only the first 26 have been dubbed in English. There is also an animated film \"Geht's auch ohne Hexerei?\".\n\nThere are also two spin-offs: \"Elea Eluanda\", appearing as a guest in episode #78 of the radio show, and \"Bibi & Tina\", in which Bibi has adventures on a riding farm with her new friend, Tina.\n\nFour films about Bibi and Tina:\n\nBibi has several cameo appearances in the series \"Benjamin the Elephant\", also by Elfie Donnelly, and the general setting and some of the characters (especially Karla Kolumna) are the same in both audio play series.\n\nThe official mobile game \"Bibi's Stardust Chase\" was released in 2013.\n\n\n\nOriginally, the series had an instrumental theme. Later it was exchanged by a vocal theme song, arranged by Heiko Rüsse. Since episode #83, there has been a new theme song, arranged by Wolfgang W. Loos and Heiko Rüsse.\n\nThe proprietors have published both the old song and the new song on YouTube.\n\nBibi Blocksberg is generally considered a good, entertaining and educational children's series.\n\nIt has however received criticism from the scientist Gerd Strohmeier. The cause of the criticism is the character of the incompetent and corrupt mayor of Neustadt, which Strohmeier claims will give a negative view of politics to children.\n\n"}

{"id": "151876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151876", "title": "Bulgarians", "text": "Bulgarians\n\nBulgarians (, \"Bǎlgari\", ) are a South Slavic ethnic group who are native to Bulgaria and its neighboring regions.\n\nBulgarians derive their ethnonym from the \"Bulgars\". Their name is not completely understood and difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD, but it is possibly derived from the Proto-Turkic word \"bulģha\" (\"to mix\", \"shake\", \"stir\") and its derivative \"bulgak\" (\"revolt\", \"disorder\"). Alternate etymologies include derivation from a compound of Proto-Turkic \"bel\" (\"five\") and \"gur\" (\"arrow\" in the sense of \"tribe\"), a proposed division within the Utigurs or Onogurs (\"ten tribes\").\n\nAccording to the Art.25 (1) of Constitution of Bulgaria, a Bulgarian citizen shall be anyone born to at least one parent holding a Bulgarian citizenship, or born on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria, should they not be entitled to any other citizenship by virtue of origin. Bulgarian citizenship shall further be acquirable through naturalization. About 77% of Bulgaria's population identified themselves as Bulgarians in 2011 Bulgarian census.\n\nThe population of Bulgaria descend from peoples with different origins and numbers. They became assimilated by the Slavic settlers in the First Bulgarian Empire. Two of the non-Slavic nations maintain a legacy among modern-day Bulgarians: \n\nFrom the indigenous Thracian people certain cultural and ethnic elements were taken. Other pre-Slavic Indo-European peoples, including Dacians (if distinct from Thracians), Celts, Goths, Romans, Ancient Greeks, Sarmatians, Paeonians and Illyrians also settled into the later Bulgarian land. The Thracian language has been described as a southern Baltic language. It was still spoken in the 6th century, probably becoming extinct afterwards, but that in a later period the Bulgarians replaced long-established Greek/Latin toponyms with Thracian toponyms might suggest that Thracian had not been completely obliterated then. Some pre-Slavic linguistic and cultural traces might have been preserved in modern Bulgarians (and Macedonians). Scythia Minor and Moesia Inferior appear to have been Romanized, although the region became a focus of barbarian re-settlements (various Goths and Huns) during the 4th and early 5th centuries AD, before a further \"Romanization\" episode during the early 6th century. According to archeological evidence from the late periods of Roman rule, the Romans did not decrease the number of Thracians significantly in major cities. By the 4th century the major city of Serdica had predominantly Thracian populace based on epigraphic evidence, which shows prevailing Latino-Thracian given names, but thereafter the names were completely replaced by Christian ones.\n\nThe Early Slavs emerged from their original homeland in the early 6th century, and spread to most of the eastern Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Balkans, thus forming three main branches: the West Slavs in eastern Central Europe, the East Slavs in Eastern Europe, and the South Slavs in Southeastern Europe (Balkans). The latter gradually inflicted total linguistic replacement of Thracian, if the Thracians had not already been Romanized or Hellenized. Most scholars accept that they began large-scale settling of the Balkans in the 580s based on the statement of the 6th century historian Menander speaking of 100,000 Slavs in Thrace and consecutive attacks of Greece in 582. They continued coming to the Balkans in many waves, but also leaving, most notably Justinian II (685-695) settled as many as 30,000 Slavs from Thrace in Asia Minor. The Byzantines grouped the numerous Slavic tribes into two groups: the Sklavenoi and Antes. Some Bulgarian scholars suggest that the Antes became one of the ancestors of the modern Bulgarians.\n\nThe Bulgars are first mentioned in the 4th century in the vicinity of the North Caucasian steppe. Scholars often suggest that the ultimate origins of the Bulgar is Turkic and can be traced to the Central Asian nomadic confederations, specifically as part of loosely related Oghuric tribes which spanned from the Pontic steppe to central Asia. However, any direct connection between the Bulgars and postulated Asian counterparts rest on little more than speculative and \"contorted etymologies\". Some Bulgarian historians question the identification of the Bulgars as a Turkic tribe and suggest an Iranian origin.In the 670s, some Bulgar tribes, the Danube Bulgars led by Asparukh and the Macedonian Bulgars, led by Kouber, crossed the Danube river and settled in the Balkans with a single migration wave, the former of which Michael the Syrian described as numbering 10,000. The Bulgars are often not thought to have been numerous, becoming a ruling elite in the areas they controlled. However, according to Steven Runciman a tribe that was able to defeat a Byzantine army, must have been of considerable dimensions. Asparukh's Bulgars made a tribal union with the Severians and the \"Seven clans\", who were re-settled to protect the flanks of the Bulgar settlements in Scythia Minor, as the capital Pliska was built on the site of a former Slavic settlement.\n\nDuring the Early Byzantine Era, the Roman provincials in Scythia Minor and Moesia Secunda were already engaged in economic and social exchange with the 'barbarians' north of the Danube. This might have facilitated their eventual Slavonization, although the majority of the population appears to have been withdrawn to the hinterland of Constantinople or Asia Minor prior to any permanent Slavic and Bulgar settlement south of the Danube. The major port towns in Pontic Bulgaria remained Byzantine Greek in their outlook. The large scale population transfers and territorial expansions during the 8th and 9th century, additionally increased the number of the Slavs and Byzantine Christians within the state, making the Bulgars quite obviously a minority. The establishment of a new state molded the various Slav, Bulgar and earlier or later populations into the \"Bulgarian people\" of the First Bulgarian Empire speaking a South Slav language. In different periods to the ethnogenesis of the local population contributed also different Indo-European and Turkic people, who settled or lived on the Balkans.\n\nThe Bulgarians are usually regarded as part of the Slavic ethnolinguistic group. However the controversial issue of their ethnogenesis is a popular subject in the works of the nationalist scientists. The fierce debates started in the 19th century and the questionable proportions of the presumed Thracian, Bulgar, and Slavic ancestry, have depended on the geopolitical situation of the country and on ideological and political predilections. These suppoused proprtions have been changed several times during the 20th century, emphasizing usually the Slavic part of Bulgarian ancestry, related to the traditionally strong Russophilia in the country. However, during the 1970s the Thracology was especially supported by the communist authority, as an attempt to underline the indigenous influence into the Bulgarian ethnogenesis. After the fall of Communism, the spiritualized image of the Thracians began to fade. Following the cooling of the relations with Russia, and the country's EU accession, the opinion on significant Bulgar genetic impact, was launched among nationalist circles, that lately have downplayed the country's Slavic ancestry.\n\nAccording to a triple analysis – autosomal, mitochondrial and paternal — of available data from large-scale studies on Balto-Slavs and their proximal populations, the whole genome SNP data situates Bulgarians in a cluster with Romanians, Macedonians and Gagauzes, and they are at similar proximity to Montenegrins and Serbs.\n\nThe First Bulgarian Empire was founded in 681. After the adoption of Orthodox Christianity in 864 it became one of the cultural centres of Slavic Europe. Its leading cultural position was consolidated with the invention of the Cyrillic script in its capital Preslav at the eve of the 10th century. The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy in the country had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into neighbouring cultures and it also stimulated the development of a distinct ethnic identity. A symbiosis was carried out between the numerically weak Bulgars and the numerous Slavic tribes in that broad area from the Danube to the north, to the Aegean Sea to the south, and from the Adriatic Sea to the west, to the Black Sea to the east, who accepted the common ethnonym \"Bulgarians\". During the 10th century the Bulgarians established a form of national identity that was far from modern nationalism but helped them to survive as a distinct entity through the centuries.\n\nIn 1018 Bulgaria lost its independence and remained a Byzantine subject until 1185, when the Second Bulgarian Empire was created. Nevertheless, at the end of the 14th century, the Ottomans conquered the whole of Bulgaria. Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an inferior class of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and a small portion of the Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete Islamisation. Orthodox Christians were included in a specific ethno-religious community called \"Rum Millet\". To the common people, belonging to this Orthodox commonwealth became more important than their ethnic origins. This community became both, basic form of social organization and source of identity for all the ethnic groups inside it. In this way, ethnonyms were rarely used and between the 15th and 19th centuries, most of the local people gradually began to identify themselves simply as \"Christians\". However, the public-spirited clergy in some isolated monasteries still kept the distinct Bulgarian identity alive, and this helped it to survive predominantly in rural, remote areas. Despite the process of ethno-religious fusion among the Orthodox Christians, strong nationalist sentiments persisted into the Catholic community in the northwestern part of the country. At that time, a process of partial hellenisation occurred among the intelligentsia and the urban population, as a result of the higher status of the Greek culture and the Greek Orthodox Church among the Balkan Christians. During the second half of the 18th century, the Enlightenment in Western Europe provided influence for the initiation of the National awakening of Bulgaria in 1762.\n\nSome Bulgarians supported the Russian Army when they crossed the Danube in the middle of the 18th century. Russia worked to convince them to settle in areas recently conquered by it, especially in Bessarabia. As a consequence, many Bulgarian colonists settled there, and later they formed two military regiments, as part of the Russian military colonization of the area in 1759–1763.\n\nDuring the Russo-Turkish Wars (1806–1812) and (1828–1829) Bulgarian emigrants formed the Bulgarian Countrymen's Army and joined the Russian army, hoping Russia would bring Bulgarian liberation, but its imperial interests were focused then on Greece and Valachia. The rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire led to a struggle for cultural and religious autonomy of the Bulgarian people. The Bulgarians wanted to have their own schools and liturgy in Bulgarian, and they needed an independent ecclesiastical organisation. Discontent with the supremacy of the Greek Orthodox clergy, the struggle started to flare up in several Bulgarian dioceses in the 1820s.\n\nIt was not until the 1850s when the Bulgarians initiated a purposeful struggle against the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The struggle between the Bulgarians and the Greek Phanariotes intensified throughout the 1860s. In 1861 the Vatican and the Ottoman government recognized a separate Bulgarian Uniat Church. As the Greek clerics were ousted from most Bulgarian bishoprics at the end of the decade, significant areas had been seceded from the Patriarchate's control. This movement restored the distinct Bulgarian national consciousness among the common people and led to the recognition of the Bulgarian Millet in 1870 by the Ottomans. As result, two armed struggle movements started to develop as late as the beginning of the 1870s: the Internal Revolutionary Organisation and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano. The issue of Bulgarian nationalism gained greater significance, following the Congress of Berlin which took back the regions of Macedonia and Adrianople area, returning them under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Also an autonomous Ottoman province, called Eastern Rumelia was created in northern Thrace. As a consequence, the Bulgarian national movement proclaimed as its aim the inclusion of most of Macedonia, Thrace and Moesia under Greater Bulgaria.\n\nEastern Rumelia was annexed to Bulgaria in 1885 through bloodless revolution. During the early 1890s, two pro-Bulgarian revolutionary organizations were founded: the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization and the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee. In 1903 they participated in the unsuccessful Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomans in Macedonia and the Adrianople vilayet. Macedonian Slavs were identified then predominantly as Bulgarians, and significant Bulgarophile sentiments endured up among them until the end of the Second World War.\n\nIn the early 20th century the control over Macedonia became a key point of contention between Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia, who fought the First Balkan War of (1912–1913) and the Second Balkan War of (1913). The area was further fought over during the World War I (1915–1918) and the World War II (1941–1944).\n\nMost Bulgarians live in Bulgaria, where they number around 6 million, constituting 85% of the population. There are significant Bulgarian minorities in Serbia, Turkey, Albania, Romania (Banat Bulgarians), as well as in Ukraine and Moldova (see Bessarabian Bulgarians). Many Bulgarians also live in the diaspora, which is formed by representatives and descendants of the old (before 1989) and new (after 1989) emigration. The old emigration was made up of some 2,470,000 economic and several tens of thousands of political emigrants, and was directed for the most part to the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil and Germany. The new emigration is estimated at some 970,000 people and can be divided into two major subcategories: permanent emigration at the beginning of the 1990s, directed mostly to the U.S., Canada, Austria, and Germany and labour emigration at the end of the 1990s, directed for the most part to Greece, Italy, the UK and Spain. Migrations to the West have been quite steady even in the late 1990s and early 21st century, as people continue moving to countries like the US, Canada and Australia. Most Bulgarians living in Canada can be found in Toronto, Ontario, and the provinces with the most Bulgarians in Canada are Ontario and Quebec. According to the 2001 census there were 1,124,240 Bulgarian citizens in the city of Sofia, 302,858 in Plovdiv, 300,000 in Varna and about 200,000 in Burgas. The total number of Bulgarians stood at over 9 million.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, ethnic Macedonians, most of the Serbian Torlaks and Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia self-identified as Bulgarians.\n\nBulgarians are considered most closely related to the neighbouring Macedonians; indeed it is sometimes said there is no discernible ethnic difference between them. The ethnic Macedonians were considered Bulgarians by most ethnographers until the early 20th century and beyond with a big portion of them evidently self-identifying as such. The Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia and most among the Torlaks in Serbia have also had a history of identifying as Bulgarians and many were members of the Bulgarian Exarchate, which included most of the territory regarded as Torlak. The greater part of these people were also considered Bulgarians by most ethnographers until the early 20th century and beyond.\n\nThe Bulgarian culture has largely the product of influence of incoming cultures and is now going through westernization, especially the cuisine.\n\nBulgarians speak a Southern Slavic language which is mutually intelligible with Macedonian and to a lesser degree with Serbo-Croatian, especially the western dialects. The lexical similarities between Bulgarian and Macedonian are 86%, between Bulgarian and each other Slavic language are 71%–80%, but with the Baltic languages they are 40–46%, while with English are about 20%. Only fewer than a dozen of Bulgarian words are derived from Turkic Bulgar.\n\nBulgarian demonstrates some linguistic developments that set it apart from other Slavic languages shared with Romanian, Albanian and Greek (see Balkan language area). Bulgarian was influenced lexically by medieval and modern Greek, and Turkish. Medieval Bulgarian influenced the other South Slavic and Romanian. With Bulgarian and Russian there was a mutual influence in both directions. The language of each other was official or lingua franca of each other in the Middle Ages and the Cold War. Recently, Bulgarian has borrowed many words from German, French and English.\n\nThe Bulgarian language is spoken by the majority of the Bulgarian diaspora, but less so by the descendants of earlier emigrants to the U.S., Canada, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nBulgarian linguists consider the officialized Macedonian language (since 1944) a local variation of Bulgarian, just as most ethnographers and linguists until the early 20th century considered the local Slavic speech in the Macedonian region. The president of Bulgaria Zhelyu Zhelev, declined to recognize Macedonian as a separate language when the Republic of Macedonia became a new independent state. The Bulgarian language is written in the Cyrillic script.\n\nIn the first half of the 10th century, the Cyrillic script was devised in the Preslav Literary School, Bulgaria, based on the Glagolitic, the Greek and Latin alphabets. Modern versions of the alphabet are now used to write five more Slavic languages such as Belarusian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian and Ukrainian as well as Mongolian and some other 60 languages spoken in the former Soviet Union. Medieval Bulgaria was the most important cultural centre of the Slavic peoples at the end of the 9th and throughout the 10th century. The two literary schools of Preslav and Ohrid developed a rich literary and cultural activity with authors of the rank of Constantine of Preslav, John Exarch, Chernorizets Hrabar, Clement and Naum of Ohrid. Bulgaria exerted similar influence on her neighbouring countries in the mid- to late 14th century, at the time of the Tarnovo Literary School, with the work of Patriarch Evtimiy, Gregory Tsamblak, Constantine of Kostenets (Konstantin Kostenechki). Bulgarian cultural influence was especially strong in Wallachia and Moldova where the Cyrillic script was used until 1860, while Church Slavonic was the official language of the princely chancellery and of the church until the end of the 17th century.\n\nThere are several different layers of Bulgarian names. The vast majority of them have either Christian (names like Lazar, Ivan, Anna, Maria, Ekaterina) or Slavic origin (Vladimir, Svetoslav, Velislava). After the Liberation in 1878, the names of historical Bulgar rulers like Asparuh, Krum, Kubrat and Tervel were resurrected. The old Bulgar name Boris has spread from Bulgaria to a number of countries in the world.\n\nMost Bulgarian male surnames have an \"-ov\" surname suffix (Cyrillic: \"-ов\"), a tradition used mostly by Eastern Slavic nations such as Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. This is sometimes transcribed as \"-off\" or \"-of\" (John Atanasov—John Atanasoff), but more often as \"-ov\" (e.g. Boyko Borisov). The \"-ov\" suffix is the Slavic gender-agreeing suffix, thus \"Ivanov\" () literally means \"Ivan's\". Bulgarian middle names are patronymic and use the gender-agreeing suffix as well, thus the middle name of Nikola's son becomes \"Nikolov\", and the middle name of Ivan's son becomes \"Ivanov\". Since names in Bulgarian are gender-based, Bulgarian women have the \"-ova\" surname suffix (Cyrillic: \"-овa\"), for example, \"Maria Ivanova\". The plural form of Bulgarian names ends in \"-ovi\" (Cyrillic: \"-ови\"), for example the \"Ivanovi\" family ().\n\nOther common Bulgarian male surnames have the \"-ev\" surname suffix (Cyrillic: \"-ев\"), for example \"Stoev\", \"Ganchev\", \"Peev\", and so on. The female surname in this case would have the \"-eva\" surname suffix (Cyrillic: \"-ева\"), for example: \"Galina Stoeva\". The last name of the entire family then would have the plural form of \"-evi\" (Cyrillic: \"-еви\"), for example: the \"Stoevi\" family ().\n\nAnother typical Bulgarian surname suffix, though less common, is \"-ski\". This surname ending also gets an \"–a\" when the bearer of the name is female (\"Smirnenski\" becomes \"Smirnenska\"). The plural form of the surname suffix \"-ski\" is still \"-ski\", e.g. the \"Smirnenski\" family ().\n\nThe ending \"–in\" (female \"-ina\") also appears rarely. It used to be given to the child of an unmarried woman (for example the son of \"Kuna\" will get the surname \"Kunin\" and the son of \"Gana\" – \"Ganin\"). The surname suffix \"-ich\" can be found only occasionally, primarily among the Roman Catholic Bulgarians. The surname ending \"–ich\" does not get an additional \"–a\" if the bearer of the name is female.\n\nMost Bulgarians are at least nominally members of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church founded in 870 AD (autocephalous since 927 AD). The Bulgarian Orthodox Church is the independent national church of Bulgaria like the other national branches of the Orthodox communion and is considered a dominating element of Bulgarian national consciousness. The church was abolished once, during the period of Ottoman rule (1396—1878), in 1873 it was revived as Bulgarian Exarchate and soon after raised again to Bulgarian Patriarchate. In 2011, the Orthodox Church at least nominally had a total of 4,374,000 members in Bulgaria (59% of the population), down from 6,552,000 (83%) at the 2001 census. 4,240,000 of these pointed out the Bulgarian ethnic group. The Orthodox Bulgarian minorities in the Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Greece, Albania, Ukraine and Moldova nowadays hold allegiance to the respective national Orthodox churches.\n\nDespite the position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as a unifying symbol for all Bulgarians, small groups of Bulgarians have converted to other faiths through the course of time. During Ottoman rule, a substantial number of Bulgarians converted to Islam, forming the community of the Pomaks or Muslim Bulgarians. In the 16th and the 17th centuries Roman Catholic missionaries converted a small number of Bulgarian Paulicians in the districts of Plovdiv and Svishtov to Roman Catholicism. Nowadays there are some 40,000 Roman Catholic Bulgarians in Bulgaria, additional 10,000 in the Banat in Romania and up to 100,000 people of Bulgarian ancenstry in South America. The Roman Catholic Bulgarians of the Banat are also descendants of Paulicians who fled there at the end of the 17th century after an unsuccessful uprising against the Ottomans. Protestantism was introduced in Bulgaria by missionaries from the United States in 1857. Missionary work continued throughout the second half of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. Nowadays there are some 25,000 Protestant Bulgarians in Bulgaria.\n\nBoris Christoff, Nicolai Ghiaurov, Raina Kabaivanska and Ghena Dimitrova made a precious contribution to opera singing with Ghiaurov and Christoff being two of the greatest bassos in the post-war period. The name of the harpist-Anna-Maria Ravnopolska-Dean is one of the best-known harpists today.\nBulgarians have made valuable contributions to world culture in modern times as well. Julia Kristeva and Tzvetan Todorov were among the most influential European philosophers in the second half of the 20th century. The artist Christo is among the most famous representatives of environmental art with projects such as the Wrapped Reichstag.\n\nBulgarians in the diaspora have also been active. American scientists and inventors of Bulgarian descent include John Atanasoff, Peter Petroff, and Assen Jordanoff. Bulgarian-American Stephane Groueff wrote the celebrated book \"Manhattan Project\", about the making of the first atomic bomb and also penned \"Crown of Thorns\", a biography of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria.\nAccording to Mensa International, Bulgaria ranks 2nd in the world in Mensa IQ test-scores and its students rate second in the world in SAT scores.\nAlso, international MENSA IQ testing completed in 2004 identified as the world's smartest woman (and one of the smartest people in the world) Daniela Simidchieva of Bulgaria, who has an IQ of 200. As of 2007 CERN employed more than 90 Bulgarian scientists, and about 30 of them will actively participate in the Large Hadron Collider experiments.\n\nFamous for its rich salads required at every meal, Bulgarian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of dairy products and the variety of local wines and alcoholic beverages such as rakia, mastika and menta. Bulgarian cuisine features also a variety of hot and cold soups, an example of a cold soup being tarator. There are many different Bulgarian pastries as well such as banitsa.\n\nMost Bulgarian dishes are oven baked, steamed, or in the form of stew. Deep-frying is not very typical, but grilling—especially different kinds of meats—is very common. Pork meat is the most common meat in the Bulgarian cuisine. Oriental dishes do exist in Bulgarian cuisine with most common being moussaka, gyuvetch, and baklava. A very popular ingredient in Bulgarian cuisine is the Bulgarian white brine cheese called \"sirene\" (сирене). It is the main ingredient in many salads, as well as in a variety of pastries. Fish and chicken are widely eaten and while beef is less common as most cattle are bred for milk production rather than meat, veal is a natural byproduct of this process and it is found in many popular recipes. Bulgaria is a net exporter of lamb and its own consumption of the meat is prevalent during its production time in spring. \nBread and salt tradition in context of welcoming, which is spread in Balto-Slavs, is the usual welcoming of strangers and politicians.\n\nBulgarians may celebrate Saint Theodore's Day with horse racings. At Christmas Eve a Pogača with fortunes is cooked, which are afterwards put under the pillow. At Easter the first egg is painted red and is kept for a whole year. On the Baptism of Jesus a competition to catch the cross in the river is held and is believed the sky is \"opened\" and any wish will be fulfilled.\n\nBulgarians as Albanians nod the head up and down to indicates \"no\" and shake to indicate \"yes\". They may wear the martenitsa (мартеница)—an adornment made of white and red yarn and worn on the wrist or pinned on the clothes—from 1 March until the end of the month. Alternatively, one can take off the martenitsa earlier if one sees a stork (considered a harbinger of spring). One can then tie the martenitsa to the blossoming branch of a tree. Family-members and friends in Bulgaria customarily exchange martenitsas, which they regard as symbols of health and longevity. When a stork is seen, the martenitsa should be left on a tree. The white thread represents peace and tranquility, while the red one stands for the cycles of life. Bulgarians may also refer to the holiday of 1 March as Baba Marta (Баба Марта), meaning \"Grandmother March\". It preserves an ancient pagan tradition, possibly celebrating the old Roman new Year, beginning on 1 March, identical with Romanian Mărțișor. Pagan customs found their way to the Christian holidays. The ancient ritual of kukeri (кукери), similar to Slovenian Kurentovanje, Busójárás and Halloween, is performed by costumed men in different times of the year and after Easter. This seeks to scare away evil spirits and bring good harvest and health to the community. Goat is symbolized, that was left from the Thracian cult of Dionysian Mysteries. The ritual consists of dancing, jumping, shouting and collect gifts from the houses in an attempt to banish all evil from the village. The adornments on the costumes vary from one region to another. The Thracian Heros remains in the image of Saint George, at whose feast the agriculture is celebrated, a lamb is traditionally eaten, accomplished with ritual bathing. Saint Tryphon's fertility and wine is attributed a Thracian origin, considered to preserve the cult to Sabazius as the Kukeri. This is followed in February by Pokladi, a tradition of setting massively large fire and jump over as at the Kupala Night and a competition between couples to eat an egg on a thread is held. Another characteristic custom called nestinarstvo (нестинарство), or \"firedancing\", distinguishes the Strandzha region, as well as Dog spinning. The authentic nestinarstvo with states of trance is only preserved in the village Balgari. This ancient custom involves dancing into fire or over live embers. Women dance into the fire with their bare feet without suffering any injury or pain.\nSlavic pagan customs are preserved in Bulgarian Christian holidays. The Miladinov brothers and foreign authors noticed that even pagan prayers are preserved quoting plenty of Slavic pagan rite songs and tales remained in Bulgarians, including Macedonians and Pomaks, mainly dedicated to the divine nymphs samovili and peperuna for the feasts surva, Saint George's Day, Koleda, etc. with evidence of toponymy throughout the regional groups linking directly to the deities Svarog, Perun, Hors and Veles, while the regional group Hartsoi derive their name from god Hors. Songs dedicated to the Thracian divinity Orpheus were found in Pomaks, who is said to marry the samovili. The old Bulgarian name of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple was \"Gromnitsa\" and \"Perunov den\" dedicated to the supreme Slavic thunder god Perun. In the mix of Christian and pagan patrons of thunder, at Saint Elijah's feast day Ognyena Maria is worshiped, the Slavic goddesses assisting Perun that took a substitutional dual position of the Christian Mother of God. The custom for rain begging Peperuna is derived from the wife of Perun and the god of the rain Dodola, this was described by a 1792 Bulgarian book as a continued worship of Perun at times of absence of rain with a ritual performed by a boy or a girl dressed like Perun. Similar rain begging is called German. In case of continuous lack of rain, a custom of driving out the zmey from the area is performed. In the dualistic Slavic belief the zmey may be both good tutelary spirit and evil, in which case is considered not local and good, but evil and trying to inflict harm and drought. Saint Jeremiah's feast is of the snakes and the reptiles, there is a tradition of jumping over fire. At the Rusalska Week the girls don't go outside to prevent themselves from diseases and harm that the dead forces Rusalii can cause. This remained the holiday of the samovili. The men performing the custom are also called Rusalii, they don't let anybody pass through between them, don't talk with each other except for the evening, avoid water, if someone lacks behind a member swoops the sword over the lacker's head to prevent him from evil spirits. If the group encounter on their way a well, dry tree, old cemeteries, crossroads, they go round them three times. Before leaving rusalii say goodbye to their relatives as if they went to war, which is not surprising because some of them are killed. When two rusalii groups met there was a fight to the death in which the dead were buried in special \"rusaliyski cemetery.\" Each year there are holidays in honour of wolves and mouses. A relief for the scared believers is celebrated at the Beheading of St. John the Baptist, when according to Bulgarian belief all the mythical figures go back to their caves in a mythical village in the middle of nowhere Zmeykovo of the zmey king, along with the rusalki, samodivi, and return at Annunciation. According to other beliefs the danger peaks at the so-called few days around the New Year Eve \"Dirty Days\", this time starts at Koleda, which merged with Christmas, when groups of kids koledari visit houses, singing carols and receiving a gift at parting. It is believed that no man can go in Zmeyovo and only the magpie knows the location of this place. At many of the holidays a sexual taboo is said to be practiced to prevent conceiving a vampire or werewolf and not to work, not to go to Sedenki or go out. Live fire is set in case of epidemics. Babinden for example is rooted in the mother-goddess. On the day of St. Vlas, the tradition of a \"wooly\" god Veles established itself, a god who is considered to be a protector of shepherds, and bread is given to the livestock on that day. The ancient Slavic custom to marry died people occurred in Bulgarian society. Survakane is performed each new year with a decorated stick by children, who hit adults on the back for health at the New Year Eve, usually in exchange of money. In the Chech region there is a custom forbidding \"touching the land\", i.e. construction and agriculture, at the equinox on 25 March and the same custom is found in Belarusian Volhynia and Polesia.\n\nBulgarian mythology and fairy tales are mainly about forest figures, such as the dragon zmey, the nymphs samovili (samodivi), the witch veshtitsa. They are usually harmful and devastating, but can also help the people. The samovili are said to live in beeches and sycamores the, which are therefore considered holy and not permitted burning. Samovili, although believed to be masters of everything between the sky and the earth, \"run away\" from fraxinus, garlic, dew and walnut. Walnut remained in Christianity to be used in prayers to \"see\" the dead in Spirits Day. Dictamnus is believed to be their favourite herb, which is intoxicating. The samovili are spirits in Bulgarian beliefs are the diseases themselves and punish people, kidnap shepherds, make blind the people or drown them and are in white colored dress, they are in odd numbers, which suggest they are ones of the \"dead\". Epic heroes as Prince Marko are believed to be descended from the samodivi. The elm is believed to scare the evil forces. Sacral trees in Bulgarian beliefs are beeches and oaks. Hawthorn is believed to expel all evil forces and is applied to cure suspected vampires. The tradition forbids killing of sacred animals - deer, while it is hold a belief the samodivi runaway from horse. The alleged as \"unclean\" animals resembling the devil such as the goat are, however, exempted from being eaten as the holy ones. The zmey is transhuman and can turn \"into\" animals, plants and items, he is also \"responsible\" for diseases, madness and missing women. The female version of the Slavic zmey is Lamia and Ala is another version. The girls who practiced Lazaruvane and other rituals \"could not\" be kidnapped by the zmey. The main enemy of the Sun is the zmey, which tries to eat the Sun, which scene is preserved in church art. The sun is painted one eyed as recorded by beliefs Perun stabbed one of the sun's eyes to save the world from overheating. The born on Saturday are thought as having supernatural powers, those born at the wolves' holidays and a number of people are alleged as varkolaks and vampires. The most spread Bulgarian view of the vampire was that of a rolling bulbous balloon of blood derived from the Slavic term \"pir\" \"drink\". Rusalka is believed to be a variety of the samodivi and Nav', but the latter are considered little fairies. The Thursdays remained feasts of Perun in Bulgarian beliefs. The wind and the hot steam of the bread is believed to be the souls of the dead. From Easter to Feast of the Ascension it is believed that the death are in the flowers and the animals. Mora in Bulgarian beliefs is a black hairy evil spirit with four firing eyes associated with nightmares when causing someone to scream, similarly to Kikimora. Polunoshtnitsa and Poludnica are believed to be evil spirits causing death, while to Lesnik, Domovnik and Vodnik a dualistic nature is attributed. Thanks to the Vlshebnik, a man of the community, a magician and a priest, communication with the \"other\" world was held. Torbalan is the Sack Man used to scare children, along with Baba Yaga, who is a witch in her Bulgarian version \n\nKuma Lisa and Hitar Petar are the tricky fox and villager from the fairy tales, the tricked antagonist is often Nasreddin Hoca, whereas Bay Ganyo is a ridiculed Bulgarian villager. Ivancho and Mariika are the protagonists of the jokes.\n\nDespite eastern Ottoman influence is obvious in areas such as cuisine and music, Bulgarian folk beliefs and mythology seem to lack analogies with Turkic mythology, paganism and any non-European folk beliefs, sо in pre-Christian times the ancient Bulgars were much inferior to the Slavs in the ethnogenesis and culture that resulted in modern Bulgarians. The Slavic language was officialized at the same time with Christianity, so Slavic paganism has never been a state religion of Bulgaria or more influential than Tengriism. Most of Bulgarian land lack any pagan archeology left from the Bulgars, despite early Christianization and that during most of the pagan period medieval Bulgarian borders spread significantly only in today's northern Bulgaria. Although legacy indicating ancient Bulgar culture is at most virtually absent in modern Bulgarian culture, some authors claim there is a similarity between the dress and customs of the Chuvashes, who descend from the Volga Bulgars, and the Bulgarian ethnographic group \"Kapantsi\" from Targovishte Province and Razgrad Province, among whom the claim that they are direct descendants of Asparukh's Bulgars is popular., but Slavic elements are found among them.\n\nThe Bulgarian folk costumes feature long white robes, usually with red embrdoiery and ornaments derived from the Slavic Rachenik. \nThe Bulgarian folk costume is considered to be mainly derived from the dress of the ancient Slavs, the female dress with the overgarments joined at the shoulders that evolved from Sarafan and all the types of soukman, saya and aprons fasten at the waist are said to be directly descended from the ancient Slavs only with negligible mutation. The women's head-dress, which turned to be a must for the Bulgarian costume is a decoration with flowers optionally on a headband, that distinguishes all the Balto-Slavic peoples and is not found in western cultures. The male dress is of likewise origin, usually Riza \"robe\", poyas \"belt\", poturi \"full-bottomed breeches\" typical for the Slavs and often a tsarvul and kalpak for shoes and jacket. Among the most similar relatives of the latter for example is Ukrainian hutsul, but the kalpak is attributed to Ottoman influence. The male skirt fustanella appears on the dress only of the Macedonian Bulgarians and is of indigenous Balkan origin or influence. In some dress of Thrace the symbol of the snake as in medieval tombs is found and is considered a Thracian cultural legacy and belief.\n\nFolk songs are most often about the nymphs from Bulgarian and West Slavic mythology (samovili) and the epic heroes (yunaks). Instruments Gadulka, Gusla Duduk, gaida Dvoyanka are analogous to other Slavic gudok, dudka and Dvodentsivka. Kaval is common in the Balkans and Turkey and is akin to Arab Kawala, as well as Tapan, Goblet Drum, Zurna. The most spread dance is a circle dance called horo and khorovod. Songs are generally loud. Recent eastern influences from the genre music chalga and turbo-folk even brought a prestige for the masculine voices of females.\n\nValya Balkanska is a folk singer thanks to whom the Bulgarian speech in her song \"Izlel ye Delyo Haydutin\" will be played in the Outer space for at least 60,000 years more as part of the Voyager Golden Record selection of music included in the two Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977.\n\nAs for most European peoples, football became by far the most popular sport for the Bulgarians. Hristo Stoichkov was one of the best football (soccer) players in the second half of the 20th century, having played with the national team and FC Barcelona. He received a number of awards and was the joint top scorer at the 1994 World Cup. Dimitar Berbatov, formerly in Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Bayer Leverkusen and others, the national team and two domestic clubs, is still the most popular Bulgarian football player of the 21st century.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century Bulgaria was famous for two of the best wrestlers in the world – Dan Kolov and Nikola Petroff. Stefka Kostadinova is the best female high jumper, still holding the world record from 1987, one of the oldest unbroken world records for all kind of athletics. Ivet Lalova along with Irina Privalova is currently the fastest white woman at 100 metres. Kaloyan Mahlyanov has been the first European sumo wrestler to win the Emperor's Cup in Japan. Veselin Topalov won the 2005 World Chess Championship. He was ranked No. 1 in the world from April 2006 to January 2007, and had the second highest Elo rating of all time (2813). He regained the world No. 1 ranking again in October 2008.\n\nThe national symbols of the Bulgarians are the Flag, the Coat of Arms, the National anthem and the National Guard, as well other unofficial symbols such as the Samara flag.\n\nThe national flag of Bulgaria is a rectangle with three colours: white, green, and red, positioned horizontally top to bottom. The colour fields are of same form and equal size. It is generally known that the white represents – the sky, the green – the forest and nature and the red – the blood of the people, referencing the strong bond of the nation through all the wars and revolutions that have shaken the country in the past.\nThe Coat of Arms of Bulgaria is a state symbol of the sovereignty and independence of the Bulgarian people and state. It represents a crowned rampant golden lion on a dark red background with the shape of a shield. Above the shield there is a crown modeled after the crowns of the emperors of the Second Bulgarian Empire, with five crosses and an additional cross on top. Two crowned rampant golden lions hold the shield from both sides, facing it. They stand upon two crossed oak branches with acorns, which symbolize the power and the longevity of the Bulgarian state. Under the shield, there is a white band lined with the three national colours. The band is placed across the ends of the branches and the phrase \"Unity Makes Strength\" is inscribed on it.\n\nBoth the Bulgarian flag and the Coat of Arms are also used as symbols of various Bulgarian organisations, political parties and institutions.\n\nThe horse of the Madara Rider is preserved on the back of the Bulgarian stotinka.\n\n\n"}

Cecilia is a trans woman. Her life story was one of four main storylines in the 2017 ABC miniseries \"When We Rise\" about LGBT rights in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nCecilia was born in Hong Kong in 1965 and later immigrated to Los Angeles with her family in 1984. A year later, she moved to San Francisco to attend City College of San Francisco before transferring to Golden Gate University in 1987 with a degree in international management. Afterwards she spent a few years working as a court interpreter in Santa Clara County, and as a well-paid sales trainer at a financial company.\n\nCecilia has spent much of her adult life advocating for health related issues affecting the LGBT community. This has included working as a HIV test counselor at UCSF AIDS Health Project, HIV Program Coordinator at API American Health Forum and as Deputy Director at the Transgender Law Center. Additionally, Cecilia is the first transgender woman and first Asian to be elected to lead the Board of Directors of the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration, and the first transgender woman as well as the first person living openly with HIV to Chair the San Francisco Human Rights Commission.\n\nCecilia founded San Francisco Transgender Advocacy and Mentorship (SF TEAM) to provide events for the transgender community through the San Francisco LGBT Community Center. She was also one of the founders of the annual Trans March.\n\nIn 2013, Cecilia made headlines by making San Francisco the first city in the country to pay for gender reassignment surgery for uninsured transgender patients through her appointment to the Health Commission by Mayor Edward Lee. Through her appointment Cecilia was also able to provide training to San Francisco Department of Public Health staff members around transgender issues called “Transgender 101”.\n\nCurrently, Cecilia serves on the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, the current chair of US PLHIV Caucus and is also the Senior Director of Strategic Projects at the Transgender Law Center.\n\nIn 1992, Cecilia decided to go into transition. She became estranged from her family due to their lack of understanding towards her being transgender. She also had to resign from her around-the-clock position as a sales trainer at the financial company to facilitate the process. She then relied on her court interpreter job as the sole source of income, whose employment contract was soon terminated following a judge noticing her physical changes due to transition. She eventually ended up living on the streets and had to resort to sex work for livelihood. Being a sex worker then subjected her to sexual and physical violence. She also turned to drugs for self-medication. In the same year, she was diagnosed as HIV positive.\n\nIn 1995, almost 3 years after having been homeless, Cecilia was stabbed during a sexual assault attempt and taken to the emergency room.

{"id": "5780736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5780736", "title": "Charles R. Knight", "text": "Charles R. Knight\n\nCharles Robert Knight (October 21, 1874 – April 15, 1953) was an American wildlife and paleoartist best known for his paintings of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. His works have been reproduced in many books and are currently on display at several major museums in the United States.\n\nKnight was born in Brooklyn, New York City.\n\nAs a child, Knight was deeply interested in nature and animals, and spent many hours copying the illustrations from his father's natural history books. Though legally blind because of astigmatism and a subsequent injury to his right eye, Knight pursued his artistic talents with the help of specially designed glasses, and at the age of twelve, he enrolled at the Metropolitan Art School to become a commercial artist. In 1890, he was hired by a church-decorating firm to design stained-glass windows, and after two years with them, became a freelance illustrator for books and magazines, specializing in nature scenes.\n\nIn his free time, Knight visited the American Museum of Natural History, attracting the attention of Dr. Jacob Wortman, who asked Knight to paint a restoration of a prehistoric pig, \"Elotherium\", whose fossilized bones were on display. Knight applied his knowledge of modern pig anatomy, and used his imagination to fill in any gaps. Wortman was thrilled with the final result, and the museum soon commissioned Knight to produce an entire series of watercolors to grace their fossil halls. His paintings were hugely popular among visitors, and Knight continued to work with the museum well into the 1930s, painting what would become some of the world's most celebrated images of dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, and prehistoric humans.\n\nOne of Knight's best-known pieces for the American Museum of Natural History is 1897's \"Leaping Laelaps\", which was one of the few pre-1960s images to present dinosaurs as active, fast-moving creatures (thus anticipating the \"Dinosaur Renaissance\" theories of modern paleontologists like Robert Bakker). Other familiar American Museum paintings include Knight's portrayals of \"Agathaumas\", \"Allosaurus\", \"Brontosaurus\", \"Smilodon\", and the Woolly Mammoth. All of these have been reproduced in numerous places and have inspired many imitations.\n\nKnight's work for the museum was not without critics, however: many curators argued that his work was more artistic than scientific, and protested that he did not have sufficient scientific expertise to render prehistoric animals as precisely as he did. While Knight himself agreed that his murals for the Hall of the Age of Man were \"primarily a work of art,\" he insisted that he had as much paleontological knowledge as the museum's own curators.\n\nAfter Knight established a reputation at the American Museum of Natural History, other natural history museums began requesting paintings for their own fossil exhibits. In 1925, for example, Knight produced an elaborate mural for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County which portrayed some of the birds and mammals whose remains had been found in the nearby La Brea Tar Pits. The following year, Knight began a 28-mural series for Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, a project which chronicled the history of life on earth and took four years to complete. At the Field Museum, he produced one of his best-known pieces, a mural featuring \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Triceratops\". This confrontation scene between a predator and its prey would inspire a huge number of imitations, establishing the two dinosaurs as \"mortal enemies\" in the popular consciousness. The Field Museum's Alexander Sherman says, \"It is so well-loved that it has become the standard encounter for portraying the age of dinosaurs\".\nKnight's work also found its way to the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh, the Smithsonian Institution, and Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History, among others. Several zoos, such as the Bronx Zoo, the Lincoln Park Zoo, and the Brookfield Zoo, also approached Knight to paint murals of their living animals, and Knight enthusiastically complied. Knight was actually the only person in America allowed to paint Su Lin, a giant panda that lived at Brookfield Zoo during the 1930s.\n\nWhile making murals for museums and zoos, Knight continued illustrating books and magazines, and became a frequent contributor to \"National Geographic\". He also wrote and illustrated several books of his own, such as \"Before the Dawn of History\" (Knight, 1935), \"Life Through the Ages\" (1946), \"Animal Drawing: Anatomy and Action for Artists\" (1947), and \"Prehistoric Man: The Great Adventure\" (1949). Additionally, Knight became a popular lecturer, describing prehistoric life to audiences across the country.\n\nEventually, Knight began to retire from the public sphere to spend more time with his grandchildren, who shared his passion for animals and prehistoric life. In 1951, he painted his last work, a mural for the Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Two years later, he died in Manhattan.\n\nKnight has been hailed as \"one of the great popularizers of the prehistoric past\", and as having influenced generations of museum-goers. Examples of Knight's work frequently appeared in dinosaur books published in the US during the first half of the twentieth century. Many works released since then also include examples of Knight's paintings; for example, Stephen Jay Gould used one of Knight's paintings for the cover of his 1991 book \"Bully for Brontosaurus\" and another in his 1996 book \"Dinosaur in a Haystack\". Though many other paleoartists have succeeded Knight (most notably Zdeněk Burian) Knight's paintings still remain very popular among paleontology enthusiasts. A commemorative edition of Knight's 1946 book \"Life Through the Ages\" was recently published by Indiana University Press, and a 2007 calendar of Knight's paintings is also currently available. Additionally, fantasy artist William Stout has compiled a series of \"Charles Knight Sketchbooks\", which contain many rare and previously unpublished drawings and studies by Knight. \nBecause Knight worked in an era when new and often fragmentary fossils were coming out of the American west in quantity, not all of his creations were based on solid evidence; dinosaurs such as his improbably-adorned \"Agathaumas\" (1897) for example, were somewhat speculative. His depictions of better-known ceratopsians as solitary animals inhabiting lush grassy landscapes were largely imaginative (the grasslands that feature in many of his paintings didn't appear until the Cenozoic).\nAlthough Knight sometimes made musculoskeletal studies of living animals, he did not do so for his dinosaur restorations, and he restored many dinosaurs with typical reptilian-like limbs and narrow hips (Paul, 1996). In the 1920s, studies by the celebrated palaeontologists Alfred Romer and Gerhard Heilmann (Heilmann, 1926) had confirmed that dinosaurs had broad avian-like hips rather than those of a typical reptile. Knight often restored extinct mammals, birds and marine reptiles in very dynamic action poses, but his depictions of large dinosaurs as ponderous swamp-dwellers destined for extinction reflected more traditional concepts (Paul, 1996). In his catalogue to \"Life through the Ages\" (1946), he reiterated views that he had written earlier (Knight, 1935), describing the great beasts as \"slow-moving dunces\" that were \"unadaptable and unprogressive\" while conceding that small dinosaurs had been more active. Some of his pictures are now known to be wrong, such as the tripod kangaroo-like posture of the hadrosaurs and theropods, whereas their spinal column was roughly horizontal at the hip; and the sauropods standing deeply in water whereas they were land-dwellers. Knight also drew dinosaur tails dragging on the ground, whereas they were held out approximately horizontally.\nThe late Stephen Jay Gould was one of Knight's most well-known fans, notably refusing to refer to \"Brontosaurus\" as \"Apatosaurus\" because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name. Gould writes in his 1989 book \"Wonderful Life\", \"Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day\".\nOther admirers have included special effects artist Ray Harryhausen, who writes in his autobiography \"An Animated Life\", \"Long before Obie (Willis O'Brien), myself, and Steven Spielberg, he put flesh on creatures that no human had ever seen. […] At the L.A. County Museum I vividly remember a beautiful Knight mural on one of the walls depicting the way the tar pits would have looked in ancient times. This, plus a picture book about Knight's work my mother gave me, were my first encounters with a man who was to prove an enormous help when the time came for me to make three-dimensional models of these extinct beings\". Paleoartist Gregory S. Paul has also mentioned Knight as a big influence on him.\nIn 2012 a book about Knight and his art written by Richard Milner titled \"Charles R. Knight The Artist Who Saw Through Time\" was published.\n\nAn homage to the painter was also made in the IMAX feature film, \"\", in which he was portrayed by actor Tuck Milligan.\n\n \nKnight's works are currently included as part of the permanent collections of these colleges, libraries, museums, and zoos:\n\nIn addition, a touring exhibit, Honoring the Life of Charles R. Knight, was launched in 2003 and has visited several locations throughout the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Knight's dark side see: Brian Regal, 'Henry Fairfield Osborn: Race and the Search for the Origins of Man' (Ashgate, 2002).\n"}

He was a vocal critic during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and braved potential detention and death threats to condemn human rights abuses and other atrocities the regime undertook.\n\nThe process for his potential beatification opened in 2012 and he is titled as a Servant of God. He has also been referred to as the \"bishop of the poor\" for his dedication to the poor and oppressed.\n\nEnrique Alvear Urrutia was born on 31 January 1916 in Cauquenes in Chile as the eighth of eleven brothers to Clorindo Alvear Zurita and Teodorinda Urrutia Pérez; his brother was Eduardo.\n\nHe spent his education first in his hometown and then in the Luis Campino Humanities Institute before he pursued a law degree from 1934 in the Pontifica Universidad Católica de Chile. In one spiritual retreat of Monsignor Carlos Casanueva Opazo he discovered his call to the priesthood and he began his ecclesial studies.\n\nHe received his ordination to the priesthood in the Santiago Cathedral on 20 September 1941 from José María Caro Rodríguez and then started pastoral work in archdiocese. He first worked as a professor in addition to being a spiritual director for seminarians. Pope John XXIII appointed him in 1963 as a bishop assigned as one of the auxiliaries for the Talca diocese while making him the Titular Bishop of Columnata. He received his episcopal consecration a month after the appointment from Raúl Silva Henríquez; the co-consecrators were Manuel Larraín Errazuriz and Eladio Vicuña Aránquiz. In 1965 he was appointed as the Bishop of San Felipe; he held that position until he resigned in 1974. But since he was under the retirement age Pope Paul VI named him as one of the two auxiliaries for the Santiago archdiocese as well as the Titular Bishop of Sita. He served as a Council Father in the Second Vatican Council in the second to fourth sessions.\n\nHe opposed human rights abuses during the Pinochet dictatorship and defended the regime's victims all the while braving potential detention and death threats. In the evening on 11 September 1973 - against the advice of his aides - he went to prisons to inquire about people who were rounded up in a wave of arrests as part of Pinochet's coup against the sitting President Salvador Allende. There was also one occasion where bombs were placed in his office in a failed attempt to intimidate him into silence. He later became involved with the Episcopal Conference of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nHe died on 29 April 1982 and his remains were interred in the Marian shrine Nuestra Señora de Lourdes in Quinta Normal until their transferral on 13 April 2008 to the San Luis Beltrán church. Pope Francis - during his trip to Chile in 2018 - made an unscheduled visit to the late bishop's tomb for some brief moments of reflection.\n\nThe beatification process was initiated in the Santiago archdiocese; initial steps towards opening the cause came on 16 December 2011 when the then-Archbishop (now cardinal) Ricardo Ezzati Andrello named the Enrique Alvear Urrutia Foundation as the official actor for promoting the cause. Ezzati later inaugurated the diocesan phase for the cause on 9 March 2012 and closed it later on 3 December 2014; during 2013 the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared \"nihil obstat\" (no objections) to the cause.\n\nThe current postulator for the cause is the Jesuit priest Pascual Cebollada Silvestre.\n\n"}

The museum shows memorabilia of the late president, from his stint in the armed forces down to his presidency. The large cenotaph which contains the glass-encased coffin in which the widely believed embalmed body of Marcos was on public display shortly after his remains were brought in Ilocos Norte from the United States in 1993 until his body was re-interred at the Heroes' Cemetery in Taguig on November 18, 2016. A wax replica of Marcos remains to be displayed inside the glass coffin.\n\nOn September 28, 1989, Marcos died of lung, kidney and liver complications in Hawaii, three years after he, his family and allies were exiled. In 1986, Marcos fled the country in the face of a nonviolent revolution \"people power\" which set the end of his regime. The odyssey of his remains began when the government of President Corazon Aquino denied Marcos' return to the Philippines. Thus Marcos' remains was interred in a private air conditioned mausoleum at Byodo-In, a Japanese Buddhist temple, on the island of Oahu.\n\nIn September 1993, after having been kept in a refrigerated, glass-topped coffin inside an air-conditioned crypt for four years, Marcos' remains were finally taken to the Philippines. The newly elected president who succeeded Aquino, Fidel Ramos, second cousin of the late president, allowed Imelda Marcos, Marcos' widow, to bring her husband's body home but refused her demand for a hero’s burial.\n\nEventually, after series of rituals and ceremonies, Marcos' remains were interred in a mausoleum in his hometown for public display, according to his family President Benigno Aquino III, son of the late Corazon and Benigno Aquino Jr., tasked Jejomar Binay to determine if Marcos should be buried in the Heroes' Cemetery. Binay made his recommendation, though Aquino has not yet made a decision. Just recently, the new president, Rodrigo Duterte approved Marcos burial in the cemetery and was buried in the place on November 18, 2016.\n\nFrank Malabed, Marcos' mortician, states that he has helped preserve the body during its interment at the former mausoleum in Barac. It took him three weeks to restore Marcos' body so that Filipinos would recognize it. Local morticians maintain and check it regularly. Formaldehyde was used to preserve the body before it was flown to the Philippines.\n\nIt was reported on August 2016, that Historian Antonio Montalvan II said that a close Marcos family friend of his revealed that the body displayed on the glass coffin was a wax figure and not the preserved remains of Ferdinand Marcos. Montalvan added that the real body of Marcos is buried underneath the glass coffin.\n\nA wax replica of Marcos' remains was reportedly left inside the glass coffin on the day Marcos' real body was interred at the Heroes' Cemetery.

Klausner was the great uncle of Israeli author Amos Oz.\n\nJoseph Klausner was born in Olkeniki, Vilna Governorate in 1874. At the turn of the 20th century, the Klausners left Lithuania and settled in Odessa. Klausner was active in the city's scientific, literary and Zionist circles. He was a committed Zionist who knew Theodore Herzl personally and attended the First Zionist Congress.\n\nIn 1912, Klausner visited Palestine for the first time, and settled there in 1919. In 1925, he became a professor of Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He specialized in the history of the Second Temple period. Although not an Orthodox Jew, he observed Sabbath and the dietary laws. He had a wide grasp of the Talmud and Midrashic literature.\n\nJoseph Klausner was a member of the circle of Russian Zionist political activists from Odessa, which included Ze'ev Jabotinsky and Menachem Ussishkin. Although not a 'party man,' he supported Revisionist Zionism. In July 1929, Klausner established the Pro-Wailing Wall Committee to defend Jewish rights, and resolve problems over access and arrangements for worship at the Western Wall. His house in Talpiot neighborhood of Jerusalem was destroyed in the 1929 Palestine riots.\n\nDespite his Zionist ideology, Klausner had numerous disagreements with Chaim Weizmann. The two were candidates in the presidential election of 1949; Weizmann was declared the first President of Israel.\n\nKlausner earned his Ph.D. in Germany. One of his most influential books was about Jesus. The book \"Jesus of Nazareth\", and its sequel, \"From Jesus to Paul\", gained him fame. In it, Klausner described how Jesus was best understood as a Jew and Israelite who was trying to reform the religion, and died as a devout Jew. Herbert Danby, an Anglican priest, translated the work from Hebrew into English so that English scholars might avail themselves of the information. A number of clergymen, incensed at Danby for translating the book, demanded his recall from Jerusalem. Later in his career, he was given a chair in Jewish history.\n\nAmos Oz wrote about Klausner in his semi-autobiographical work \"A Tale of Love and Darkness\".\n\nIn both 1941 and 1949, Klausner was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought.\nIn 1958, he was awarded the Israel Prize in Jewish studies.\nIn 1982, in recognition of his scholarly achievements, the State of Israel issued a stamp with his picture on it.\n\n\n\n"}

She was born in 1810 and died in 1915. She was one of the few Myaamia who was not removed from Indiana in 1846.\n\nKiilh-sooh-kwa was born in 1810 in an area she described in an interview in 1906 as near present-day Markle, Huntington County in northeast Indiana. Separate sources suggest she was born at the Forks of the Wabash, closer to present-day Huntington, Huntington County, Indiana. She was the granddaughter of Myaamia Chief Mihšihkinaahkwa (var. \"Little Turtle\"). Her father, Wok-shin-gah (var. \"Crescent Moon\") was Mihšihkinaahkwa's son. Her mother was Nah-wah-kah-mo-kwa (var. \"Snow Woman\").\n\nHer first husband was John Owl, the son of Chief John Owl. In 1826, the pair wed in an area referred to as Seek's Village around the Eel River. John passed away with the first year or two of their marriage. In 1832, Kiilh-sooh-kwa wed Shaw-pe-nom-quah (var. \"Anthony Revarre\"), who was of half Native American, half French descent trader. Together Kiilh-sooh-kwa and Shaw-pe-nom-quah had six children, four of whom died in infancy. Her two surviving children were a son, Wa-pe-mung-quah (var. \"Little White Loon, Anthony Revarre, Jr.\"), and a daughter, Wan-nog-quan-quah (var. \"Snow, Mist, or Fog; Blowing Snow; Happy Fawn; Mary E. Johnson\").\n\nLittle is documented of her young adult life, though in 2013 she was described by the Smithsonian Institution as an important midwife in Indiana who understood and used plant knowledge related to childbirth. In her later years, she lived in Roanoke, Indiana on but forty acres of what remained of her family's and her nation's territory. She only spoke in her native language despite some sources suggested she understood some English. One of the few English words that she knew and used frequently was \"rheumatism,\" given her affliction with the disease. She was described in 1905 as \"a big woman, of swarthy appearance, and...a devotee of the pipe, which she has with her almost incessantly\" and, separately, was described as a devout Catholic.\n\nIn 1915, a Fort Wayne-based newspaper reported that, \"if a stranger called, the old woman would grasp the hand and give a firm grip, and after looking you over would in her quaint way and feeble voice mutter a few words in her native tongue, that if interpreted would be a hearty welcome.\" An estimated 15,000 attendees celebrated her 100th birthday in Roanoke and her centennial was well-documented in Indiana newspapers.\n\nShe passed away on 4 September 1915 at her home in Roanoke after spending a few weeks ill and confined to her bed. Her death was described as \"without a struggle, for death was only a break in the well worn thread of life.\" Her passing was characterized in 1917 as a loss of \"the last royal Miamis and the oldest resident of the State of Indiana, who had enjoyed a national reputation.\" Her funeral services were held at St. James Catholic Church in Roanoke and she was buried in the I.O.O.F. Cemetery (Glenwood Cemetery) in Roanoke.\n"}
{"id": "1532157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1532157", "title": "Kim Dotcom", "text": "Kim Dotcom\n\nKim Dotcom (born Kim Schmitz, 21 January 1974), also known as Kimble and Kim Tim Jim Vestor, is a German-Finnish Internet entrepreneur and political activist who resides in Queenstown, New Zealand. He first rose to fame in Germany in the 1990s as an Internet entrepreneur.\n\nDotcom is the founder of now-defunct file hosting service Megaupload (2005–2012). Earlier, he achieved notoriety in Germany as a teen hacker who received a two-year suspended sentence for selling identities that he had siphoned from telephone operators' client database. Since the closure of Megaupload, he has been accused of criminal copyright infringement and other charges, such as money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud, by the U.S. Department of Justice. \n\nOn 20 February 2017, a New Zealand court ruled that Dotcom, as well as co-accused Mathias Ortmann, Bram van der Kolk and Carter Edwards, could be extradited to the US on fraud charges related to Megaupload. Dotcom denies any wrongdoing and has accused US authorities of pursuing a vendetta against him on behalf of politically influential Hollywood studios. On 5 July 2018, the New Zealand Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's ruling. His lawyer said that he would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 2013, Dotcom launched another cloud storage service called Mega, although he later severed all ties with the service in 2015. He also started and funded the Internet Party. The party contested the 2014 New Zealand general election under an electoral alliance with the Mana Movement, and the 2017 general election, but failed to win any seats at either election.\n\nDotcom was born Kim Schmitz in 1974 in Kiel in the north of Germany in what was then politically West Germany. His mother was Finnish, from Turku, so he holds a Finnish passport and has siblings in Finland. His father was German.\n\nHe has been called one of the world's \"largest tech entrepreneurs\". He changed his surname to Dotcom in 2005, as \"a homage to the technology that made him a millionaire\". At the time, he was living in Hong Kong, where he set up Megaupload.\n\nPrior to his arrest in New Zealand, he enjoyed a luxurious life. In 2001, his main source of income was a company called Kimvestor, which he valued at 200 million euros. He is known for spending his money on expensive cars and boats. On one occasion he spent $1 million chartering a 240-foot luxury yacht which he moored in Monte Carlo harbour during the 2000 Monaco Formula One Grand Prix, and threw lavish parties for guests including Prince Rainier of Monaco. \n\nAccording to U.S. officials, he owned at least 18 luxury cars, and three cars with vanity license plates that read HACKER, MAFIA, and STONED. He has taken part in the Gumball 3000 international road rally: in 2001 in his Mercedes Brabus SV12 Megacar, and in 2004. In an interview with the Belgian television station VTM, he said that in Morocco during the 2004 rally, a car was blocking him and he \"had to bump him off the road. Nothing happened to him\". He said that he subsequently found out it was the Chief of Police in a civilian car. Despite his flamboyant image, he is a teetotaller.\n\nHe was granted permanent residence in New Zealand on 29 November 2010. At the time his residency application was being considered, Dotcom had made charitable contributions in New Zealand and was planning a huge fireworks show for the city of Auckland at a cost of NZ$600,000. He leased a NZ$30M mansion at Coatesville, in the electorate of John Key near Auckland, owned by Richard and Ruth Bradley, the British founders of Chrisco, and considered one of the most expensive homes in the country. He wanted to buy the mansion when the lease expired. \n\nBefore his arrest in New Zealand, he was the world's number-one-ranked \"\" player out of more than 15 million online players. On 23 January 2012, he lost the position and dropped to number two.\n\nIn 2007, Dotcom met Mona Verga, whom he described as his \"soulmate\" and the \"love\" of his life, and married her on 10 July 2009. He became the father of twin girls (his fourth and fifth children) when Verga gave birth in Auckland a month after he was released on bail from Mt Eden prison. On 17 May 2014, Dotcom announced on Twitter that he was separated from his wife Mona and was filing for divorce. Four days earlier, Mona had left her directorship positions in the Dotcom family's companies.\n\nIn November 2017, Dotcom announced he would marry his fiancé, Elizabeth Donnelly, on 20 January 2018 - the anniversary of the raid during which he was arrested. Dotcom is 21 years older than Donnelly. They had been dating for two years and in 2017 moved to Queenstown to live.\n\nAs a teenager, Schmitz acquired a reputation in his native Germany after saying that he had bypassed the security of NASA, the Pentagon and Citibank under the name of Kimble – based on the character of Dr Richard Kimble in the long-running television programme \"The Fugitive\". He also stated that he hacked corporate PBX systems in the United States and said he was selling the access codes at $200 each, bragging that \"every PBX is an open door to me\".\n\nIn 1994, he was arrested by German police for trafficking in stolen phone calling card numbers. He was held in custody for a month, released and arrested again on additional hacking charges shortly afterwards. He was eventually convicted of 11 counts of computer fraud, 10 counts of data espionage, and an assortment of other charges. He received a two-year suspended sentence – because he was underage at the time the crimes were committed. The judge in the case said the court viewed his actions as \"youthful foolishness\".\n\nIn 2001, Schmitz bought €375,000 worth of shares of the nearly bankrupt company and subsequently announced his intention to invest €50 million in the company. The announcement caused the share value of Letsbuyit.com to jump and Schmitz cashed out, making a profit of €1.5 million. One commentator suggested that Schmitz may have been ignorant of the legal ramifications of what he had done, since insider trading was not made a crime in Germany until 1995, and until 2002 prosecutors also had to prove the accused had criminal intent.\n\nDotcom moved to Thailand to avoid investigation where he was subsequently arrested on behalf of German authorities. In response, he allegedly pretended to kill himself online, posting a message on his website that from now on he wished to be known as \"His Royal Highness King Kimble the First, Ruler of the Kimpire\". He was deported back to Germany where he pleaded guilty to embezzlement in November 2003 and, after five months in jail awaiting trial, again received a suspended sentence, this time of 20 months. After avoiding a prison sentence for a second time, he left Germany and moved to Hong Kong in late 2003.\n\nDotcom found Hong Kong to his liking and registered Kimpire Limited in December 2003, soon after moving there. He set up a network of interlinked companies, including Trendax, which he said was an artificial intelligence-driven hedge fund that delivered an annual return of at least 25%. However, Trendax was never registered with Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission and the company was legally not allowed to accept investments or to conduct trades. After moving to New Zealand, Dotcom was convicted for failing to disclose his shareholding to the Securities and Futures Commission, and was fined HK$8,000.\n\nWhile living in Hong Kong, Dotcom visited New Zealand for 10 days in December 2008 and again for two months from August 2009. On his 2009 visit, he bought 12 cars, valued at $3.2 million, and leased a helicopter on a stand-by basis. He applied for residency and received it in November 2010. Immigration New Zealand made its decision on his application (despite his foreign convictions and despite his \"persona non grata\" status in Thailand) after officials used a special direction to waive \"good character\" requirements. Warwick Tuck, head of Immigration New Zealand, said that New Zealand granted Dotcom residency under the \"investor plus\" category, which allows people to gain residency if they invest $10 million in New Zealand. It was anticipated that Dotcom would contribute to New Zealand through investment, consumption and philanthropic activities – he has given $50,000 to the mayoral fund following the Christchurch earthquake, another $50,000 to a rugby player who was left in a wheelchair after an on-field injury and funded a $600,000 fireworks display in Auckland harbour. Mr Tuck says Dotcom disclosed his previous convictions and these had been considered; they occurred more than 16 years earlier and did not involve harming anyone. Dotcom also told Immigration New Zealand his convictions had been \"erased\" from his record under Germany's clean-slate legislation.\n\nDespite granting him residency, Immigration New Zealand expressed concern that their decision might attract criticism that they had allowed Dotcom to buy his way into the country, and officials tried to keep it secret. Officials red-flagged his application: \"We are requesting that this application be kept as confidential as possible to avoid further media speculation or attention.\" Dotcom's residency status subsequently became the subject of intense media speculation when it came to light that Auckland Mayor John Banks had become involved, and that New Zealand's intelligence services had illegally spied on him (see below) – which they were not allowed to do because he had residency. Immigration New Zealand officers judged Dotcom's convictions in Hong Kong too minor to consider deporting him.\n\nIn October 2014, it became public that on 10 September 2009, Dotcom had been caught driving at 149 km/h in a 50 km/h zone. He pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving, and on 14 September 2009, was convicted under his former name of Kim Schmitz. The court fined him $500 and $130 court costs, and banned him from driving for six months. On his residency application of 3 June 2010, he answered \"No\" to the question, \"Have you ... been ... convicted of an offence (including a traffic offence) committed in the last five years involving dangerous driving.\" Immigration New Zealand said it was looking into the matter, which raises the possibility that Dotcom could be deported.\n\nJohn Banks met Dotcom when he was Mayor of Auckland. He asked Dotcom for help putting on a fireworks display in the city's harbour. Banks later attended a New Year's Eve party thrown by Dotcom at the city centre apartment of now bankrupt property developer David Henderson. He said it provided a great view of the fireworks display detonated over the Waitematā Harbour. Banks said he offered advice to the millionaire on how to apply for Overseas Investment Office permission to buy the Coatesville mansion Dotcom had been renting since coming to New Zealand.\n\nOn 28 April 2012 Dotcom revealed he also donated $50,000 to John Banks' mayoralty campaign in 2010, and that Banks asked him to split the donation in two, allowing the Banks campaign to claim them as anonymous by falling within the anonymous limit of $25,000. In 2014, Banks was found guilty of filing a false electoral return, with evidence from Dotcom playing a major part in the case. This conviction was subsequently overturned on appeal following the discovery of new evidence, and a planned retrial was later cancelled and a verdict of acquittal entered. Among Dotcom's revelations was a phone call from Banks, thanking him for the contribution. Dotcom subsequently recorded a song titled \"Amnesia\", which mocks John Banks' inability to remember the $50,000 donation.\n\nA poll in October 2012 found the New Zealand public had a more favourable view of Kim Dotcom than of Banks.\n\nIn February 2003, at the same time he registered Trendax, Dotcom set up another company called Data Protect Limited, but changed the name to Megaupload in 2005. Megaupload was a file hosting and sharing online service in which users could share links to files for viewing or editing. In \"10 Facts about the Megaupload Scandal\", Dotcom describes the company like this: \"Megaupload is a provider of cloud storage services. The company's primary website, Megaupload.com, offered a popular Internet-based storage platform for customers, who ranged from large businesses to individuals. This storage platform allowed its users to store files in the Internet \"cloud\" and to use, if needed, online storage space and bandwidth.\" The company was successful. However, millions of people from across the globe used Megaupload to store and access copies of TV shows, feature films, songs, porn, and software. Eventually it had over 150 employees, US$175 million revenues, and 50 million daily visitors. At its peak Megaupload was estimated to be the 13th most popular site on the Internet and responsible for 4% of all Internet traffic.\n\nOn 5 January 2012, indictments were filed in Virginia in the United States against Dotcom and other company executives with crimes including racketeering, conspiring to commit copyright infringement, and conspiring to commit money laundering. Two weeks later (20 January), Kim Dotcom, Finn Batato, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk were arrested in Coatesville, Auckland, New Zealand, by New Zealand Police, in an armed raid on Dotcom's house involving 76 officers and two helicopters. Assets worth $17 million were seized including eighteen luxury cars, giant screen TVs and works of art. Dotcom's bank accounts were frozen denying him access to US$175m (NZ$218m) in cash, the contents of 64 bank accounts world-wide, including BNZ and Kiwibank accounts in New Zealand, Government bonds and money from numerous PayPal accounts.\n\nDotcom was remanded to Mt Eden Prison. He subsequently reported: \"The first night I didn't have a blanket, soap, toothpaste or toilet paper. They didn't provide us with the basic things... Every two hours, they would wake me up. I was deprived of sleep. I wrote a complaint. I said, 'This is torture, this is sleep deprivation'.\" He said he was treated like a convicted criminal and was \"stunned to be locked up in prison over claims of criminal copyright infringements when accused murderers were bailed to await trial\". On 22 February, North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned previous rulings and released Dotcom on bail. The judge considered there was no longer a significant risk that Dotcom would flee the country as all of his assets had been seized by this time, no new assets or bank accounts had been identified, and he had \"every reason to stay to be with his family and fight to keep his assets.\"\n\nOn 28 June 2012, High Court of New Zealand Justice Helen Winkelmann found that the warrants used to seize Dotcom's property were illegal because they were too broad. \"These categories of items were defined in such a way that they would inevitably capture within them both relevant and irrelevant material. The police acted on this authorization. The warrants could not authorize seizure of irrelevant material, and are therefore invalid.\" News emerged later that the Crown knew it was using the wrong order while the raid was in progress and Dotcom should have been given the chance to challenge the seizure. The Crown also revealed that police had handed seized hard drives to FBI staff who copied them at the police crime lab in South Auckland and sent the copies back to the US. Justice Winkelmann ruled that handing the hard drives seized in the raid to the FBI was in breach of extradition legislation and the FBI's cloning of the hard-drives was also invalid.\n\nDeclaring the search warrants to be invalid was a significant victory for Dotcom because he was struggling to pay his mounting legal bills. At a hearing in the High Court on 28 August 2012, Justice Judith Potter allowed Dotcom to withdraw approximately NZ$6 million (US$4.8 million) from his seized funds. He was also allowed to sell nine of his cars. The amount released was to cover $2.6 million in existing legal bills, $1 million in future costs, and another $1 million in rent on his New Zealand mansion.\n\nIn May 2012, a district court judge ruled that the FBI should hand over all its evidence against Dotcom relating to the extradition bid. The Crown appealed, but the ruling was upheld by the High Court. The Crown appealed again and in March 2013, the Court of Appeal quashed the previous court decisions. Crown lawyer John Pike, on behalf of the US Government, argued that the district court had no power to make disclosure decisions in an extradition case and that \"disclosure was extensive and could involve billions of emails\". The Court of Appeal agreed stating that extradition hearings were not trials and the full protections and procedures for criminal trials did not apply. Dotcom's lawyer, Paul Davison, QC, appealed to the Supreme Court. In May 2013, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, so it will make the final decision on whether Dotcom should receive all the FBI investigation files before the extradition hearing.\n\nA series of subsequent court decisions delayed every attempt to hold a hearing focused on extradition. In March 2013, Dotcom won a Court of Appeal ruling allowing him to sue the GCSB, rejecting the attorney-general's appeal against a ruling in December 2012. A month later, Dotcom appeared in court again, seeking compensation from police over the raid on his house, which earlier had been deemed illegal.\n\nIn November 2017, Dotcom and his former wife Mona accepted a confidential settlement from the police over the raid. The settlement came after a damages claim was filed with the High Court over the \"unreasonable\" use of force when the anti-terrorism Special Tactics Group raided his mansion in January 2012. Settlements have already been reached between police and Bram van der Kolk and Mathias Ortmann who were also arrested. The \"New Zealand Herald\" reported that their settlements were six-figure sums and \"it is likely Dotcom would seek more as the main target in the raid\". Commenting on the settlement, Dotcom said: \"We were shocked at the uncharacteristic handling of my arrest for a non-violent Internet copyright infringement charge brought by the United States, which is not even a crime in New Zealand\".\n\nIn February 2014, the New Zealand Court of Appeal deemed the raids on Kim Dotcom to be legal but not the FBI's taking of information. Dotcom appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. In December four of the five judges agreed with the Court of Appeal that the raid was legal and ordered Dotcom to pay $35,000 costs. Chief Justice Sian Elias dissented, saying there had been a miscarriage of justice as the search warrant was too broad.\n\nA month before the Supreme Court decision, Dotcom's legal team quit after he had spent $10 million on his defence, financed the Internet Party, but then ran out of money. When the US tried to have his bail revoked, a new lawyer, Ron Mansfield, helped keep him out of prison. In December 2014, events took another turn when the High Court in Hong Kong ruled that the United States \"did not have a clear path to serve a legal summons on Dotcom's filesharing company\" and he could take a case to get back $60 million seized by authorities there. In making this decision, Judge Tallentire said, \"No one can say when that process of extradition will be completed given the appeal paths open to the various accused. Indeed, no one can say if it will ever be completed\".\n\nAfter his arrest by the New Zealand police in January 2012, Dotcom had an ongoing dispute with Prime Minister John Key about when Key had first become aware of Dotcom. Dotcom argued that Key had been involved in a plan to allow him into New Zealand so that he could then be extradited to the US to face copyright charges. Key had consistently said he had never heard of Dotcom until the day before the New Zealand police raid on his mansion in Coatesville.\n\nOn 24 September 2012, Mr Key revealed that, at the request of the police, the New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) had spied on Dotcom, illegally helping police to locate him and monitor his communications in the weeks prior to the raid on his house. The GCSB are not allowed to spy on New Zealand citizens or permanent residents; Dotcom, though not a citizen, had been granted permanent residency. Three days later, the Prime Minister John Key apologized for the illegal spying. \"I apologize to Mr Dotcom. I apologize to New Zealanders because every New Zealander… is entitled to be protected from the law when it comes to the GCSB Government Communications Security Bureau, and we failed to provide that appropriate protection for him.\"\n\nIn December 2012, Chief High Court judge Helen Winkelman ordered the GCSB to \"confirm all entities\" to which it gave information sourced through its illegal spying. This opened the door for Dotcom to sue for damages – against the spy agency and the police. The Crown appealed but in March 2013, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision.\n\nThe mistakes by authorities attracted widespread media coverage and Key's handling of the affair was criticised by opposition parties in Parliament. Political commentator Bryce Edwards said the GCSB's involvement and the botched search warrants \"turned the pursuit of (Dotcom) and the operations of our law-enforcement agencies into the stuff of farce\". A \"Waikato Times\" editorial said that the announcement of the illegal spying \"heightened suspicions that this country's relationship with the United States has become one of servility rather than friendship. ... It is preposterous to suggest Mr Dotcom threatens our national security. The Government's unquestioning readiness to co-operate with American authorities seriously corrodes our claims to be an independent state.\" \"The Sunday Star-Times\" commentator Richard Boock compared the Dotcom saga to Watergate and suggested it might eventually 'bring down' John Key. The story made headlines overseas, including in the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"New York Times\", \"The Guardian\", and the \"Hollywood Reporter\" which specialises in legal and entertainment issues.\n\nIn September 2013, Dotcom revealed he aspired to enter New Zealand politics. On 27 March 2014, Dotcom founded the Internet Party. In May 2014, it was announced that the Internet Party would form a political alliance with the Mana Party, led by local activist and sitting Member of Parliament Hone Harawira. The deal was brokered to serve the Mana Party financially, with the combined structure's political campaign in the 2014 general election being primarily funded by Dotcom. In contrast, the fledgling Internet Party was to benefit from the possibility of seats in parliament in the event that the combined structure were to achieve a greater percentage of the country's vote, helped along by the Mana Party's existing seat. Due to his citizenship status, Dotcom was ineligible to become a member of parliament, and Laila Harré, a veteran of left-wing politics and trade unions, was chosen as leader of the Internet Party.\n\nOn 16 September 2014, Dotcom held an event in the Auckland Town Hall five days before the election in which he promised to provide 'absolute proof' that Key knew about him long before he was arrested. The event was billed as the 'Moment of Truth' and included the release of an email dated 27 October 2010 from Kevin Tsujihara, the chief executive of Warner Bros to a senior executive at the Motion Picture Association of America – the lobby group for the Hollywood studios. \"The New Zealand Herald\", which broke the story, contacted Warner Bros., who said the email was a fake.\n\nIn the 2014 general election, the joint Internet Party and Mana Movement gained 1.42% of the nationwide party vote but failed to win any seats. Dotcom, who was not a candidate because he is not a New Zealand citizen, sank $NZ3.5 million dollars into the Internet Party, the largest personal contribution to a political party on record in New Zealand, according to the national Electoral Commission. \"I take full responsibility for this loss tonight,\" Dotcom told reporters as election results became clear, \"because the brand—the brand Kim Dotcom—was poison for what we were trying to achieve\". The Serious Fraud Office investigated the email and determined that it was a forgery.\n\nThe media criticised Dotcom for 'failing to deliver' at the Moment of Truth after saying for three years that he could prove John Key had lied in relation to his copyright case. After the election, in which the Internet Mana alliance failed to win a seat, public support for Dotcom seemed to dissipate. Dotcom said in January 2015 he had become such 'a pariah' in New Zealand that he might as well leave the country.\n\nThe party remained leaderless until 8 February 2017, when Suzie Dawson was appointed as its new leader for the 2017 general election. The Mana connection was dropped and the party contended as the single entity the Internet Party. The Internet Party ran 8 party list candidates. The party won only 499 votes (0.0%) and failed to win any seats in the New Zealand House of Representatives.\n\nThe Internet Party was deregistered on 12 June 2018 because its membership had dropped below the 500 required for registration.\n\nAfter three years' legal wrangling, involving two supreme court cases and 10 separate delays in the proceedings, extradition proceedings finally got underway in an Auckland court on 21 September 2015.\n\nThe wrangling continued at the hearing with Dotcom and his colleagues saying that they were unable to present a proper defence because the US had threatened to seize any funds they try to spend on international experts in Internet copyright issues. Dotcom's American lawyer, Ira Rothken, said they would need about US$500,000 to get evidence from the appropriate experts. Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig, an international expert in copyright and fair use, provided his written opinion for free. He said there were no legal grounds to extradite Dotcom and the allegations and evidence made public by the US Department of Justice \"do not meet the requirements necessary to support a prima facie case that would be recognised by United States federal law\".\n\nOnce the hearing finally got under way, Crown prosecutor Christine Gordon, on behalf of the US Government, called it a \"simple scheme of fraud\". Defence Lawyer Ron Mansfield's 300 page submission began with the argument that the case should be thrown out because the United States Supreme Court ruled in a parallel case in 1982 that copyright infringement was a civil matter and could not be prosecuted as criminal fraud.\n\nThe Crown also made numerous references to intercepted Skype conversations between Dotcom and his co-defendants. Christine Gordon said one message written by Dotcom, when translated from German, read: \"At some point a judge will be convinced about how evil we are and then we are in trouble.\" Mr Mansfield said this sentence was used repeatedly by Ms Gordon during her submission \"with the knowledge that it would make international media headlines\". Mansfield had the passage translated by three independent academics who said it had a very different meaning and should read: \"At some stage a judge will be talked into how bad we allegedly are and then it will be a mess.\"\n\nOn 23 December 2015, North Shore District Court Judge, Nevin Dawson, announced that Dotcom and the three other Megaupload co-founders were eligible for extradition. He said the US had a \"large body of evidence\" which supported a prima facie case. An immediate appeal was lodged by Dotcom's lawyer.\nIn February 2017, the New Zealand High Court upheld the earlier decision of the district court that Dotcom and his three co-accused could be extradited to the United States. However, Justice Murray Gilbert accepted the argument made by Dotcom's legal team that he and his former Megaupload colleagues cannot be extradited because of copyright infringement. The judge said he made this decision because: \"online communication of copyright protected works to the public is not a criminal offence in New Zealand\". However, Justice Gilbert said there were \"general criminal law fraud provisions\" in New Zealand law which covered the actions of the accused and they could be extradited on that basis.\n\nDotcom saw this decision as a major victory saying: \"The major part of this litigation has been won by this judgement - that copyright is not extraditable.\" The ruling opened the door to further appeals because the warrant which was served on him when he was arrested on 20 January 2012, stated he was being charged specifically with \"copyright\" offences. Both sides are expected to challenge aspects of the ruling before the New Zealand Court of Appeal and eventually the Supreme Court.\n\nOn 5 July 2018, the New Zealand Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision that Dotcom and the three co-accused could be extradited to the United States. In particular, the Court, disagreeing with Justice Gilbert, found that, even during the time of Megaupload's operations, it is a criminal offence in New Zealand to possess digital copyrighted works with an intention to disseminate them. Accordingly, Dotcom and his co-accused could be extradited on the basis of copyright infringement to stand trial in the United States. Dotcom's lawyer said that he would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a lengthy article on TorrentFreak, Dotcom said that he was not guilty of insider trading in Germany. He said the judge and prosecutor offered him a suspended sentence if he pleaded guilty. \"I took the deal and moved on with my life instead of spending the next few years in court rooms defending my innocence.\" Commenting on his business activities in Hong Kong, he said: \"Hong Kong, what an awesome place to do business and to host my new phantom persona. I should write a book about doing business in Hong Kong, that's how good it is.\"\n\nDotcom also wrote: \"I made mistakes when I was young and I paid the price. Steve Jobs was a hacker and Martha is doing well after her insider trading case. I think over a decade after all of this happened it should NOT be the dominating topic. I am 37 years old now, I am married, I have three adorable children with two more on the way (twin girls – yeah) and I know that I am not a bad person. I have grown and I have learned. Making this into an issue about my past is unfair to everyone else working at Mega. Our business is legitimate.\" \"We have spent millions of dollars on legal advice over the last few years and our legal advisers have always told us that we are secure and that we are protected by the DMCA, which is a law in the US that is protecting online service providers of liability for the actions of their users.\"\n\nIn regard to Megaupload, Dotcom says he believes the company had actively tried to prevent copyright infringement – its terms of service forced users to agree they would not post copyrighted material to the website. Companies or individuals with concerns that their copyright material was being posted on Megaupload were given direct access to the website to delete infringing links. Megaupload also employed 20 staff dedicated to taking down material that might infringe copyright. Dotcom also explained that Megaupload was responsible for the transfer of 800 files every second and that it would be impossible to police all that traffic. In addition, US privacy laws, such as Electronic Communication Privacy Act, prohibit the administrators from looking into the accounts of the users.\n\nOn 1 March 2012, Dotcom gave his first interview to New Zealand media after his arrest to John Campbell of Campbell Live. He said the services offered by his Megaupload site were not significantly different from comparable services using cloud technology such as Rapidshare or YouTube, and he has just been used as a scapegoat because of his involvement with hacking activities in the past. He explained the close ties of his case to that of Viacom vs YouTube in which the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) shielded YouTube from the infringement of its users and described his surprise when he was arrested without trial or a hearing.\n\nDotcom says that he is a legitimate businessman who has been unfairly demonized by United States authorities and industry trade groups such as the RIAA and MPAA. He blames former US President Barack Obama for colluding with Hollywood to orchestrate his arrest and has spoken out against his negative portrayal in the media. In regard to the illegal spying conducted by GCSB, Dotcom said they were not spying to find out where he was. \"The GCSB was utilised to surveil all my communication in order to give the U.S. Government full access to all my communication, without the requirement of a warrant,\" he said. In May 2013, Dotcom released a 39-page white paper that links his prosecution to Hollywood studios. He states that the US government prosecuted him in return for contributions from the studios to President Barack Obama. He released the paper to coincide with the visit to New Zealand of United States Attorney General, Eric Holder, head of the US Justice Department, which oversees the FBI.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister John Key added to speculation about Hollywood's role in October 2012 when it was announced he was going on a four-day visit to meet top studio executives. Key said the trip was intended to promote New Zealand as a good country to produce movies, but he was planning to meet with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), which had described Dotcom as \"a career criminal\". Using Twitter, Dotcom said that Chris Dodd was \"responsible for the destruction of Megaupload & the abuse of my family\".\n\nIn November 2013, \"The New Zealand Herald\" senior journalist David Fisher published \"The Secret Life of Kim Dotcom: Spies, Lies and the War for the Internet.\" The book covers aspects of Dotcom's personal life and reveals that he fears for his life. He is quoted telling a friend \"Don't just let it go\", if he is killed as part of US allegations of copyright breaches associated with Megaupload.\n\nFollowing the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, Dotcom launched a group called Young Intelligent Hackers Against Terrorism (YIHAT). He said that he had hacked Sudanese bank accounts belonging to Osama Bin Laden and offered a $10 million reward for information leading to Osama's capture on his now-defunct kimble.org site.\n\nDotcom participated in a mock funeral procession for public broadcaster TVNZ 7 in downtown Auckland, on the day of its final broadcast. He had warmed to one of its more notable shows, \"Media7\", for its championing of Internet freedom, and had been interviewed on the show at least once.\n\nIn February 2012, Lindsey Stirling released Lord of The Rings Medley, a music video funded by Dotcom.\n\nIn August 2012, Dotcom released a song titled \"Party Amplifier\" as a sample of his upcoming album. Dotcom was already in the process of recording the album with friend and producer Printz Board (who wrote \"Yes We Can\" for Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign) when he was arrested. Printz and Dotcom recorded more than 20 songs at Neil Finn's Roundhead Studios in Newton, Auckland – one of which is called \"Mr President\" – an electronica protest against Barack Obama, who Dotcom believes was involved in shutting down Megaupload.\n\nIn June 2012, Dotcom announced on Twitter the launch of Megabox, a new music streaming service to rival Spotify. He announced in October 2012 that Megabox would launch on 19 January 2013, the first anniversary of the closure of Megaupload and the raid on his Auckland property. However, later said that Megabox would be launched a few months after Mega.\n\nOn 2 November, Dotcom announced a new file storage service, similar to Megaupload, using the domain name me.ga. It was to be launched 19 January 2013, but the African state of Gabon, which controls the .ga domain, cancelled the me.ga name on 6 November 2012. The site has since registered the names mega.co.nz and mega.net.nz. The new file hosting service offers file encryption to enhance user privacy and security. As a result of this encryption, Dotcom and mega.co.nz will not know of the content of the uploaded data, allowing for the claim of plausible deniability to be made should new charges arise. In January 2013, Dotcom offered a $13,500 reward to anyone able to defeat the site's security system.\n\nDotcom has been involved in the local community in Auckland. In December 2012, he announced that he would be playing the part of Santa Claus in the play \"MegaChristmas\", run by Auckland's Basement Theatre. In a local ceremony on the first of that month, he turned on the Franklin Road Christmas lights and delivered a speech before the display.\n\nOn 4 September 2013, Kim Dotcom stepped down as director of Mega, and announced he was working on a music streaming service called Baboom. Dotcom says it will be more advanced than Megabox.\n\nOn 10 September 2013, Dotcom announced that he would play 100 people in \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\" at New Zealand's first Digital Entertainment Expo, DIGITAL NATIONZ. The former world number one would play a mix of challengers from the audience who could win prizes for beating him, as well as play against celebrities for charities Y for Youth and Starship Hospital.\n\nOn 25 December 2014, Dotcom helped stop the Christmas DDoS attacks on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network by giving Lizard Squad 3,000 $99 one year MEGA accounts which would then be converted to lifetime accounts worth approximately $300,000.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, Dotcom posted a statement to his website saying to have information relevant to the investigation into the July 2016 murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich. Dotcom said that he had proof that Rich was the source of the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak, and that he was willing to provide evidence if US special counsel Robert Mueller could guarantee his safe passage from New Zealand to the United States. Seth Rich's family issued a statement calling Dotcom's statements \"ridiculous, manipulative, and non-credible.\" Also in 2017, the biographical documentary \"Kim Dotcom: Caught in the Web\", directed by Annie Goldson, premiered at the New Zealand International Film Festival.\n\n"}

He is best known for his 2017 song \"Gucci Gang\", which peaked at number three on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and is certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. His other songs include \"I Love It\" (with Kanye West), \"Boss\", \"Esskeetit\", and \"Drug Addicts\". He released his debut studio album, \"Lil Pump\", on October 6, 2017.\n\nGazzy Garcia was born August 17, 2000 in Miami, Florida. In a 2018 interview with J. Cole, he stated that both of his parents are from Colombia and that they divorced when he was six years old. He also mentions having an older half-brother.\n\nWhen he was thirteen years old, his cousin, Lil Ominous, introduced him to Omar Pineiro, better known as Smokepurpp; the two eventually became collaborators. Garcia and Piniero were expelled from multiple district schools. Garcia, thereafter, enrolled in an opportunity high school but was expelled in the tenth grade for fighting and inciting a riot.\n\nLil Pump's rap career began when Smokepurpp produced a track and asked him to freestyle over it. The single produced was independently released in 2016 on the music streaming website SoundCloud, as his debut single, \"Lil Pump\". Lil Pump quickly followed the song with singles \"Elementary\", \"Ignorant\", \"Gang Shit\", and \"Drum$tick\", each possessing over three million streams. The success of his tracks on SoundCloud earned him recognition among the South Florida underground rap scene, in a style known as \"SoundCloud rap\". He co-headlined the No Jumper tour in 2016, and also performed at the Rolling Loud Festival.\n\nLil Pump began 2017 by releasing the singles \"D Rose\" and \"Boss\", which were major hits on SoundCloud, collecting a combined 70 million streams. The popularity of \"D Rose\" led to a music video being produced by Chicago based director Cole Bennett, also known as Lyrical Lemonade. The music video was released on YouTube on January 30, 2017, and has gained 145 million views as of July 2018. On June 9, 2017, Lil Pump signed a record deal with Tha Lights Global and Warner Bros. Records, just two months before his seventeenth birthday. However, in January 2018, his contract with Warner Bros. Records was voided because he had been a minor at the time of signing.\n\nIn July 2017, Lil Pump announced through Twitter that his debut album was in the works and would be released in August. Although the album was not released in August it was pushed back and he instead released the song \"Gucci Gang\", which became his first \"Billboard\" Hot 100 entry, peaking at number three on November 8, 2017. The song was certified gold and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on January 11, 2018 and as of July 31, 2018 is certified triple platinum.\n\nOn October 6, 2017, he released his debut commercial studio album, \"Lil Pump\", featuring Smokepurpp, Gucci Mane, Lil Yachty, Chief Keef, Rick Ross, and 2 Chainz. \n\nLil Pump released \"I Shyne\" on January 18, 2018 with producer Carnage. Following reports that he had left his former label Warner Bros. Records and the contract had been voided on the grounds of him being a minor when he signed, competition rose to sign Lil Pump with offers reportedly as high as $8 million to $12 million or more, and artists such as Gucci Mane and DJ Khaled taking interest in him. Lil Pump sparked rumors he had signed with Gucci Mane's imprint, 1017 Records, in February 2018. Nonetheless, he re-signed another contract with Warner Bros. for $8 million on March 12, 2018.\n\nOn April 13, 2018, Lil Pump released \"Esskeetit\", which debuted and peaked at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In July 2018, he released the single \"Drug Addicts\" alongside a music video which features Charlie Sheen.\n\nOn September 7, 2018, Lil Pump collaborated with Kanye West and comedian Adele Givens for the track \"I Love It\". The track went straight to number 1 on the Canadian Hot 100.\n\nLil Pump announced in August 2018 a tour to promote his upcoming album \"Harverd Dropout\", but it was cancelled a month later due to \"unforeseen circumstances\". On October 5, 2018, he released \"Multi Millionaire\" as a single featuring Lil Uzi Vert.\n\nOn October 25, 2018, EDM DJ-producer Skrillex released the song \"Arms Around You\", which is a collaboration he made with Lil Pump, XXXTentacion, Maluma and Swae Lee.\n\nOn February 15, 2018, Lil Pump was arrested for discharging a weapon in an inhabited place. According to his manager, three men attempted to break into his home in San Fernando Valley at around 4 pm before shooting into the door. Police found the bullet may have come from inside the home, coming back later with a search warrant before finding an unloaded handgun below the balcony with ammunition elsewhere in the residence. Lil Pump's mother was subsequently investigated for endangering a minor and having an unsecured firearm at the home.\n\nOn August 29, 2018, Lil Pump was arrested for driving without a license in Miami.\nOn September 3 he announced that he would be going to jail for 'a few months' for a parole violation stemming from the arrest. However, he appeared on the live American television show \"Saturday Night Live\" on September 29. Lil Pump's manager told \"Billboard\" in October 2018 that the rapper had served a prison sentence, but did not give any further details.\n\n"}

His father, Kikubhai Desai, was an Indian film producer and owner of Paramount Studios (later Filmalaya) from 1931 to 1941. His productions, mainly stunt films, included \"Circus Queen\", \"Golden Gang\", and \"Sheikh Challi\". Manmohan Desai's older brother, Subhash Desai, became a producer in the 1950s and gave Manmohan his first break with the Hindi film \"Chhalia\" (1960). Subhash later went on to produce \"Bluff Master\", \"Dharam Veer\", and \"Desh Premee\" with Manmohan as the director.\n\nHis wife was Jeevanprabha Desai. She died in April 1979. He was engaged to actress Nanda from 1992 until the time of his death in 1994. He had one son Ketan Desai who is still involved in the film industry. Ketan is married to Kanchan Kapoor, daughter of Shammi Kapoor and Geeta Bali.\n\nOn 1 March 1994, per news Manmohan Desai fell from the balcony in Girgaon as the rail he was leaning on collapsed and died. Very little is known about his death except that he was suffering from chronic back pain. Rumours of him committing suicide have not been confirmed.\n\nManmohan Desai was known for his family-centered, action-song-and-dance films which catered to the tastes of the Indian masses and through which he achieved great success. His movies defined a new genre called masala films. A common theme in his films were the lost and found plot where family members would be separated and reunited.\n\nHe had a string of hits with Amitabh Bachchan in the 70s and early 80s which helped cement Bachchan's status as a superstar of Indian cinema. He worked with Amitabh on \"Amar Akbar Anthony\", \"Parvarish\", \"Suhaag\", \"Naseeb\", \"Desh Premee\", \"Coolie\", \"Mard\" and \"Ganga Jamuna Saraswati\"; all but the last were box office successes. He was one of the directors who had a special working relationship with Amitabh Bachchan, the others being Yash Chopra, Prakash Mehra, Ramesh Sippy, and Hrishikesh Mukherjee. Of these, only Yash Chopra went on to make hits beyond the 1980s.\n\nHe often worked with the same actors in several different films:\n\n\nApart from Bachchan, Manmohan Desai worked with such leading male stars as Raj Kapoor in the 1960 film \"Chhalia\", Shammi Kapoor in \"Bluffmaster\" (1963), Rajesh Khanna in \"Sachaa Jhutha\" (1970) and \"Roti\" (1974), Randhir Kapoor in \"Raampur Ka Lakshman\" (1972), Shashi Kapoor in \"Aa Gale Lag Jaa\", Dharmendra in \"Dharam Veer\" (1977). 1977 was an exceptional year for him. All four of his films released that year were huge hits: \"Parvarish\", \"Amar Akbar Anthony\", \"Chacha Bhatija\" and \"Dharam Veer\". The first two were with Amitabh, and the latter two were with Dharmendra.\n\nManmohan Desai worked with writers such as Salim-Javed, Prayag Raaj, K.K.Shukla, and Kader Khan, and lyricists such as Anand Bakshi, Sahir Ludhianvi, Qamar Jalalabadi, Gulshan Bawra, and Shailendra. Early in his career he worked with composers Rahul Dev Burman, Kalyanji Anandji, later with Laxmikant Pyarelal and in the 1980s with music composer Anu Malik.\n\nOut of the 20 films that Desai directed in his career span of 29 years (1960–1989), as many as 13 films were stupendous hits. His success ratio was 65 percent in an industry where flops abound. His favourite playback singer was Mohd Rafi. In most of his movie, Mohd Rafi was used to sing all of his songs. When Kishore Kumar's voice was frequently used on Amitabh Bachchan by other Directors, he used Mohd Rafi's voice on Amitabh Bachcan in films like Suhaag and Naseeb. His biggest hits of Mohd Rafi song was Pardah Hai Pardah from Amar Akbar Anthony and John Jani Janardhan from Naseeb. Manmohan Desai once said that Mohd Rafi's voice is God's voice.\n\nTowards the end of his career, Desai's previously successful stories and style began to lose favour with audiences. Critics accused him of self-parody. His last film as a director \"Ganga Jamuna Saraswati\" and the films he produced with his son Ketan Desai directing, \"Allah Rakha\" (1986), \"Toofan\" (1989) and \"Anmol\" (1993) failed at the box office.\n"}

{"id": "2010169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2010169", "title": "Marsha P. Johnson", "text": "Marsha P. Johnson\n\nMarsha P. Johnson (August 24, 1945 – July 6, 1992) was an American gay liberation activist and self-identified drag queen. Known as an outspoken advocate for gay rights, Johnson was one of the prominent figures in the Stonewall uprising of 1969. A founding member of the Gay Liberation Front, Johnson co-founded the gay and transvestite advocacy organization S.T.A.R. (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries), alongside close friend Sylvia Rivera. A popular figure in New York City's gay and art scene, Johnson modeled for Andy Warhol, and performed onstage with the drag performance troupe, Hot Peaches. Known for decades as a welcoming presence in the streets of Greenwich Village, Johnson was known as the \"mayor of Christopher Street\". From 1987 through 1992, Johnson was an AIDS activist with ACT UP.\n\nJohnson was born Malcolm Michaels Jr. on August 24, 1945 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. She had six siblings and her father, Malcolm Michaels Sr., was an assembly line worker at General Motors while her mother, Alberta Claiborne, was a housekeeper. Johnson attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church as a child and was a devout Christian throughout her life, often taking an interest in Catholicism and other faiths. Johnson first began wearing dresses at the age of five but stopped temporarily because she would get harassed by boys who lived near her house. In a 1992 interview, she described being the young victim of sexual assault by an adolescent. Johnson's mother told her that being homosexual is like being \"lower than a dog\", but Johnson said that her mother was unaware of the LGBT community. After Johnson graduated from the former Edison High School (now the Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Academy) in Elizabeth in 1963, she left her home for New York City with $15 and a bag of clothes. She waited on tables after moving to Greenwich Village in 1966.\n\nJohnson initially called herself \"Black Marsha\" but later decided on \"Marsha P. Johnson\" as her drag queen name, getting \"Johnson\" from the restaurant Howard Johnson's on 42nd Street. She said that the \"P\" stood for \"pay it no mind\" and used the phrase sarcastically when questioned about her gender, saying \"it stands for pay it no mind\". She said the phrase once to a judge, who was humored by it and released her. Johnson variably identified herself as gay, as a transvestite, and as a queen (referring to drag queen). According to Susan Stryker, a professor of human gender and sexuality studies at the University of Arizona, Johnson's gender expression may be called \"gender non-conforming\" in absence of Johnson's use of \"transgender\", which was not used broadly during her lifetime.\n\nJohnson said her style of drag was not serious (or \"high drag\") because she could not afford to purchase clothing from expensive stores. She received leftover flowers after sleeping under tables used for sorting flowers in the Flower District of Manhattan, and was known for placing flowers in her hair. Johnson was tall, slender and often dressed in flowing robes and shiny dresses, red plastic high heels, and bright wigs, which tended to draw attention. \nJohnson sang and performed as a member of J. Camicias' international, NYC-based, drag performance troupe, Hot Peaches, from 1972 through to shows in the 1990s. When The Cockettes, a similar drag troupe from San Francisco, formed an East Coast troupe, The Angels of Light, Johnson was also asked to perform with them. In 1973, Johnson performed the role of \"The Gypsy Queen\" in the Angels' production, \"The Enchanted Miracle\", about the Comet Kohoutek. In 1975, Johnson was photographed by famed artist Andy Warhol, as part of a \"Ladies and Gentlemen\" series of Polaroids. In 1990, Johnson performed with The Hot Peaches in London. Now an AIDS activist, Johnson also appears in The Hot Peaches production \"The Heat\" in 1990, singing the song \"Love\" while wearing an ACT UP, \"Silence = Death\" button.\n\nJohnson said she was one of the first drag queens to go to the Stonewall Inn, after they began allowing women and drag queens inside; it was previously a bar for only gay men. On the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, the Stonewall uprising occurred. While the first two nights of rioting were the most intense, the clashes with police would result in a series of spontaneous demonstrations and marches through the gay neighborhoods of Greenwich Village for roughly a week afterwards. \n\nJohnson has been named, along with Zazu Nova and Jackie Hormona, by a number of the Stonewall veterans interviewed by David Carter in his book, \"Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution\", as being \"three individuals known to have been in the vanguard\" of the pushback against the police at the uprising. Johnson denied she had started the uprising, stating in 1987 that she had arrived at around \"2:00 [that morning]\", and that \"the riots had already started\" when she arrived and that the Stonewall building \"was on fire\" after cops set it on fire. The riots reportedly started at around 1:20 that morning after Stormé DeLarverie fought back against the police officer who attempted to arrest her that night. \n\nCarter writes that Robin Souza had reported that fellow Stonewall veterans and gay activists such as Morty Manford and Marty Robinson had told Souza that on the first night, Johnson \"threw a shot glass at a mirror in the torched bar screaming, 'I got my civil rights'\". Souza told the Gay Activists Alliance shortly afterwards that it \"was the shot glass that was heard around the world\". Carter, however, concluded that Robinson had given several different accounts of the night and in none of the accounts were Johnson's name brought up, possibly in fear that if he publicly credited the uprising to Johnson due to her well-known mental state and gender nonconforming, then Stonewall, and indirectly the gay liberation movement, \"could have been used effectively by the movement's opponents\". The alleged \"shot glass\" incident has also been heavily disputed. Prior to Carter's book, it was claimed Johnson had \"thrown a brick\" at a police officer, an account that was never verified. However, many have corroborated that on the second night, Johnson climbed up a lamppost and dropped a bag with a brick in it down on a cop car, shattering the windshield.\n\nFollowing the Stonewall uprising, Johnson joined the Gay Liberation Front and participated in the first Christopher Street Liberation Pride rally on the first anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion in June 1970. One of Johnson's most notable direct actions occurred in August 1970 when she and fellow GLF members staged a sit-in protest at Weinstein Hall at New York University after administrators canceled a dance when they found out was sponsored by gay organizations. Shortly after that, she and close friend Sylvia Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) organization (initially titled \"Street Transvestites Actual Revolutionaries\"). The two of them became a visible presence at gay liberation marches and other radical political actions. In 1973, Johnson and Rivera were banned from participating in the gay pride parade by the gay and lesbian committee who were administering the event stating they \"weren't gonna allow drag queens\" at their marches claiming they were \"giving them a bad name\". Their response was to march defiantly ahead of the parade. During a gay rights rally at New York City Hall in the early '70s, photographed by Diana Davies, a reporter asked Johnson why the group was demonstrating, Johnson shouted into the microphone, \"Darling, I want my gay rights now!\"\n\nDuring another incident around this time, which landed Johnson in court, she was confronted by police officers for hustling in New York, and when they went to apprehend her, she hit them with her handbag, which contained two bricks. When Johnson was asked by the judge why she was hustling, Johnson explained she was trying to secure enough money for her husband's tombstone. During a time when same-sex marriage was illegal in the United States, the judge asked her what \"happened to this alleged husband\", Johnson responded, \"Pigs killed him\". Initially sentenced to 90 days in prison for the assault, Johnson's lawyer eventually convinced the judge to send her to Bellevue instead.\n\nWith Rivera, Johnson established the STAR House, a shelter for gay and trans street kids in 1972, and paid the rent for it with money they made themselves as sex workers. While the House was not focused on performance, Marsha was a \"drag mother\" of STAR House, in the longstanding tradition of chosen family in the Black and Latino LGBT community. Johnson worked to provide food, clothing, emotional support and a sense of family for the young drag queens, trans women, gender nonconformists and other gay street kids living on the Christopher Street docks or in their house on the Lower East Side of New York. \n\nIn the 1980s Johnson continued her street activism as a respected organizer and marshal with ACT UP. In 1992, when George Segal's Stonewall memorial was moved to Christopher Street from Ohio to recognize the gay liberation movement, Johnson commented, \"How many people have died for these two little statues to be put in the park to recognize gay people? How many years does it take for people to see that we're all brothers and sisters and human beings in the human race? I mean how many years does it take for people to see that we're all in this rat race together.\"\n\nBy 1966, Johnson lived on the streets and engaged in survival sex. In connection with her sex work, Johnson was arrested many times—by her count, over 100—and was also shot once, in the late-1970s. Johnson spoke of first having a mental breakdown in 1970. According to Bob Kohler, Johnson would walk naked up Christopher Street and be taken away for two or three months to be treated with chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic medication. Upon returning, the medication would wear off over the course of one month and she would then return to normal. Between 1980 and her death in 1992, Johnson lived with her friend Randy Wicker, who invited her to stay the night one time when it was \"very cold out—about 10 degrees [Fahrenheit]\" ().\n\nThough generally regarded as \"generous and warmhearted\" under her Marsha persona, Johnson's dark side sometimes emerged under Johnson's \"male persona as Malcolm\", often resulting in Johnson being hospitalized and sedated. During those moments when Johnson's violent side emerged, according to an acquaintance Robert Heide, Johnson could be aggressive and short-tempered and speak in a deeper voice and, as Malcolm, would \"become a very nasty, vicious man, looking for fights\". This dual personality of Johnson's has been described as \"a schizophrenic personality at work\". It had been this reason that gay activists had been reluctant at first to credit Johnson for helping to spark the gay liberation movement of the early 1970s due to her mental state. A 1979 Village Voice article titled \"The Drag of Politics\" by Steven Watson reported that Johnson's saintly personality was \"volatile\" and listed a roster of gay bars from which she had been banned. At the time of her death in 1992, Johnson was said to be increasingly sick and in a fragile state, according to Wicker.\n\nShortly after the 1992 pride parade, Johnson's body was discovered floating in the Hudson River. Police initially ruled the death a suicide, but Johnson's friends and other members of the local community insisted Johnson was not suicidal and noted that the back of Johnson's head had a massive wound. According to Sylvia Rivera, their friend Bob Kohler believed Johnson had committed suicide due to her ever-increasing fragile state, which Rivera herself disputed, claiming she and Johnson had \"made a pact\" to \"cross the 'river Jordan' (aka Hudson River) together\". Randy Wicker later said that Johnson may have hallucinated and walked into the river, or that she may have jumped into the river to escape her harassers, but stated she was never suicidal.\n\nSeveral people came forward to say they had seen Johnson harassed by a group of \"thugs\" who had also robbed people. According to Wicker, a witness saw a neighborhood resident fighting with Johnson on July 4, 1992. During the fight he used a homophobic slur, and later bragged to someone at a bar that he had killed a drag queen named Marsha. The witness was not successful in relaying this information to the police. Other locals stated later that law enforcement was not interested in investigating Johnson's death, stating that the case was about a \"gay black man\" and wanting little to do with at the time. Johnson was cremated and her ashes were released over the river by her friends following a funeral at the local church. Police allowed Seventh Avenue to be closed while her ashes were carried to the river.\n\nIn November 2012, activist Mariah Lopez succeeded in getting the New York police department to reopen the case as a possible homicide.\n\nThe 2012 documentary \"Pay It No Mind – The Life and Times of Marsha P. Johnson\" heavily features segments from a 1992 interview with Johnson, which was filmed shortly before her death. Many of her friends from Greenwich Village are interviewed for the documentary.\n\nJohnson appears as a character in two fictional film dramas that are based on real events, including \"Stonewall\" (2015), where she is played by Otoja Abit, and \"Happy Birthday, Marsha!\" (2016), where she is played by Mya Taylor. Both movies are creative interpretations, inspired by the Stonewall uprising.\n\nThe 2017 documentary, \"The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson\", follows trans woman Victoria Cruz of the Anti-Violence Project as she investigates Johnson's murder. Like \"Pay It No Mind\", it relies on archival footage and interviews.\n\nNew York City artist Anohni produced multiple tributes to Johnson, including baroque pop band Antony and the Johnsons (named in Johnson's honor), and a 1995 play about Johnson, \"The Ascension of Marsha P. Johnson.\"\n\nAmerican drag queen and TV personality RuPaul has called Johnson an inspiration, describing her as \"the true Drag Mother.\" During an episode of his show \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" in 2012, RuPaul told her contestants that Johnson \"paved the way for all of [them]\".\n\nIn 2018 the \"New York Times\" published a belated obituary for her.\n\n\n\n\n"}

There is a claim that the Buddha's birth was miraculous via his mother's dream of a white elephant. This does not mean that the Buddha had a virgin birth like the Christian gospels of the birth of Jesus Christ. Buddha's mother was not a virgin, but Buddha was the product of a miraculous conception and a miraculous birth. The Mahāvastu and Lalitavistara explicitly state that no carnal act took place for Buddha's conception; the Buddhacarita is ambiguous. Buddha did also have a miraculous birth. He was born out of the side of his mother.\n\nIn the Mahapadana-sutra, Digha ii. 12, is the description of the incarnation of the Vipassī Buddha.\n\"Now Vipassi, brethren, when, as Bodhisat, he ceased to belong to the hosts of the heaven of Delight, descended into his mother’s womb mindful and self-possessed.\"\n\nOther miracles and powers that Gautama Buddha was said to have possessed and exercised include the six higher knowledges (Abhijna): Iddhi, telepathy, super-hearing, divine seeing, and seeing past lives. These are described in the \"Mahasihanada Sutta\" and other suttas in the Pali canon.\n\nThe Twin Miracle at Sravasti is also considered as the Buddhist miracle par excellence.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36182422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36182422", "title": "Pangool", "text": "Pangool\n\nPangool (in Serer and Cangin) singular: Fangool (var : \"Pangol\" and \"Fangol\"), are the ancient saints and ancestral spirits of the Serer people of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania. The Pangool play a crucial role in Serer religion and history. In a religious sense, they act as interceders between the living world and the supreme being Roog or Koox. In a historical sense, the ancient Serer village and town founders called Lamanes were believed to be accompanied by a group of Pangool as they travelled in search of land to exploit. These Lamanes became guardians of Serer religion and created shrines in honour of the Pangool, thus becoming the custodians of the Pangool cult.\n\nThere are several Pangool in Serer religion and each one is associated with a specific attribute, have their own , means of worship, etc. The symbol of the Pangool is the serpent, represented by two coiled snakes.\n\n\nThe etymology of \"fangool\" comes from the Serer phrase \"Fang Qool\" which means the sacred serpent the plural of which is \"pangool\". Fangool means serpent.\n\nThere are two main types of Pangool: non-human Pangool and human Pangool. Both are sacred and ancient, but the former is more ancient as a general rule. The non-human Pangool include ancient sacred places with vital spiritual energies and personalized as such. These Pangool generally are the personifications of natural forces. Human Pangool on the other hand became Pangool once they are canonized after death. Thus some are ancient, others are medieval. Through their intercession with the divine, they form a link which transmits vital energies. Not every dead ancient ancestor is canonized as Pangool.\n\nPangool can be subdivided further into:\n\nIn addition to these, Pangool can be further categorized depending on their character and nature, such as:\n\nBlood is a sign of life in Serer cosmogony and these types of Pangool fulfill a vital role in Serer society, and are seen as one of the most ancient and powerful. The Fangool Ngolum Joof (var: Ngolum Diouf) is one of these \"blood Pangool\". In many cases, offerings of alcohol rather than the sacrifice of domesticated animals are made to these \"blood Pangool\".\nIn contrast to the \"blood Pangool\", the \"milk Pangool\" such as Moussa Sarr, Njemeh (var: Ndiémé) of Languème and Njoxona, etc., are those Pangool who are peaceful in nature and character. They even reject anything that symbolizes violence or things that may evoke destruction or death, i.e. iron, weapons, gunpowder, blood and the colour red. They usually are the protectors of Serer cities and the defenders of the weak.\n\nThe history regarding the veneration of the Pangool is found within the hermeneutics of Serer religion, oral tradition and archaeological discoveries. \nPrior to the widespread veneration of the Pangool, the religious habit of the ancient Serers included holding prayers at the beginning of the rainy season. The branches of the \"Njambayargin\" tree (bauhinia rufescens) were fetched by these ancient people because they believed the tree to possess elements which boosted the growth of their crops and produce much fruit. Ritual prayers were made to the supreme spirit Roog (or Koox among the Cangin), totally distinct from the prayers that would later become afforded to other Serer spiritual entities such as the Pangool. In Serer cosmogony, trees play a vital role in the creation narrative, as they were the first things created on Earth by the divine, followed by animals (non-humans). The exact date as to when the Pangool cult became prevalent cannot be stated with a degree of accuracy.\n\nLamane Jegan Joof founder of Tukar c. 11th century, is reported to have been accompanied by a group of Pangool when he migrated from Lambaye with his brother Ndik following a disagreement with his relative the king of Lambaye. After his migration, he founded Tukar, previously in the Serer pre-colonial Kingdom of Sine, now part of independent Senegal. Tukar is one of the , and the Pangool affiliated with it are devotedly venerated in the Serer religious calendar, such as the 'Raan festival which takes place once a year on the second Thursday after the new moon in April. The descendants of Lamane Jegan Joof (the Joof family of Tukar) play a vital role in this religious affair.\n\nThe Pangool are related to the transcendence of the divine. In the Serer home, the altar of the Pangool can not conceal that of the divine.\n\nThe Pangool provide the vital energies relating to the realities of the Serer people especially those forces outside the control of humanity. The religious practices and representations of the Pangool helps the Serer people dominate the hostile forces of nature, hence the advent of the Pangool veneration. Through their sacred intercession with the divine, these Pangool act as protectors and transmitters of vital energy to the world of the living. They can be humans, plants, animals, places, supernatural beings, etc. Animals and trees are viewed by the Serers as extended relatives of human beings, because they came from the same divine placenta at the time of the coronation.\n\nMany Pangool are spirits of early ancestors who had died. They represent both Pangool of the paternal line (\"pangool o kurcala\") and those of the maternal line (\"pangool o ƭeen yaay\"). These ancestors guide and protect their descendants. Many have a master of the cult who knows how to evokes the ancestor. The earlier Pangool were not human beings, but superior beings created by Roog at the time human beings were created. They were believed to have been created by the divine in order to help human kind. It is for this reason why the terms Pangool and \"Nguus\" (Serer word for genie) are sometimes used interchangeably. Because some Pangool are linked to Serer lineages, only the head of the lineage schooled in the rituals can make a libation to the relevant Pangool or Fangool (the ancestor).\n\nIn the other world, the ancestors are the actual carrying-holders of transcendent sacred energies. However, the Pangool are superior in title because they were not transformed in the sacred energy. Thus the distinction between a \"fangool\" (non-human) and a human-ancestor lies in the mode of their participation in the transcendence. In either case, Roog is the first source of the transcendence of sacred energies.\n\nOfferings of fruits, vegetables, crops, milk, or the sacrifice of domesticated animals are made to the Pangool in different places, eg: at the foot of trees, in forests, at community shrines, etc. There are Pangools whose scope is therapeutic, those who deliver justice (see also Takhar – spirit of justice) and those who are personal Pangool\n\nThe following table provides a sample of Pangool, their attributes and the part of they protect :\n\n\n"}
{"id": "371878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371878", "title": "Paul Williams (The Temptations)", "text": "Paul Williams (The Temptations)\n\nPaul Williams (July 2, 1939 – August 17, 1973) was an American baritone singer and choreographer. Williams was noted for being one of the founding members and original lead singer of the Motown group The Temptations. Along with Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant, Otis Williams , and fellow Alabamians Eddie Kendricks and Melvin Franklin, Williams was a member of The Temptations during the \"Classic Five\" period. Personal problems and failing health forced Williams to retire in 1971. He was found dead two years later as the result of an apparent suicide.\n\nPaul Williams was born and raised in the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham, Alabama. He was the son of Sophia and Rufus Williams, a gospel singer in a gospel music vocal group called the Ensley Jubilee Singers. He met Eddie Kendricks in elementary school; supposedly, the two first encountered each other in a fistfight after Williams dumped a bucket of mop water on Kendricks. Both boys shared a love of singing, and sang in their church choir together. As teenagers, Williams, Kendricks, and Kell Osborne and Willie Waller performed in a secular singing group known as The Cavaliers, with dreams of making it big in the music industry. In 1957, Williams, Kendricks, and Osborne left Birmingham to start careers, leaving Waller behind. Now known as The Primes, the trio moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and eventually found a manager in Milton Jenkins, who moved the group to Detroit, Michigan. Although The Primes never recorded, they were successful performers, and even launched a spin-off female group called The Primettes, who later became The Supremes.\n\nIn 1961, Kell Osborne moved to California, and the Primes disbanded. Kendricks returned to Alabama, but visited Paul in Detroit shortly after. While on this visit, he and Paul had learned that Otis Williams, head of a rival Detroit act known as The Distants, had two openings in his group's lineup. Paul Williams and Kendricks joined Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Elbridge Bryant to form The Elgins, who signed to the local Motown label in 1961, after first changing their name to The Temptations.\n\nAlthough the group now had a record deal, Paul Williams and his bandmates endured a long series of failed singles before finally hitting the Billboard Top 20 in 1964 with \"The Way You Do the Things You Do.\" More hits quickly followed, including \"My Girl\", \"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\" and \"(I Know) I'm Losing You.\"\n\nWilliams sang lead on several of the group's songs, and served as the main lead singer during the group's early years. His early leads include, \"Your Wonderful Love\" (1961), \"Slow Down Heart\" (1962), \"I Want a Love I Can See\" (1963), and \"Oh, Mother of Mine\" (1961) (the group's first single) and \"Farewell My Love\" (1963) both shared with Eddie Kendricks. Considered the Temptations' best dancer, Williams served as the group's original choreographer, devising routines for his group and The Supremes (most notably their trademark \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" routine), before Cholly Atkins took over that role for all of Motown's acts. Williams' later leads on Temptations songs include, \"Just Another Lonely Night\" (1965), \"No More Water in the Well\" (1967), a cover version of \"Hey Girl\" (1969), and his signature song \"Don't Look Back\" (1965).\n\nWilliams also sang lead with Dennis Edwards, who joined in 1968, on Motown's first Grammy Award-Winner \"Cloud Nine\". One of his best-known lead performances is his stand out live performance of \"For Once in My Life,\" from the television special \"TCB\", originally broadcast on December 9, 1968 on NBC. The live version of the song \"Don't Look Back\" is also frequently cited as one of his standout performances. He also took over the lead vocal for live performances of \"My Girl\" following David Ruffin's departure from the group.\n\nWilliams suffered from sickle-cell anemia, which frequently wrought havoc on his physical health. In 1965, Williams began an affair with Winnie Brown, hair stylist for The Supremes and a relative of Supremes member Florence Ballard. In love with Brown but still devoted to his wife and children, Williams was also depressed because Cholly Atkins' presence now made Williams' former role as choreographer essentially, but not completely, obsolete. Life on the road was starting to take its toll on Williams as well, and, having previously consumed nothing stronger than milk, he began to drink alcohol heavily, namely Courvoisier, which, according to Otis Williams, was hard to take.\n\nIn the spring of 1969, Williams and Brown opened a celebrity fashion boutique in downtown Detroit. The business was not as successful as planned, and Williams soon found himself owing more than $80,000 in taxes (US$ in dollars). His health had deteriorated to the point that he would sometimes be unable to perform, suffering from combinations of exhaustion and pain which he combated with heavy drinking. Each of the other four Temptations did what they could to help Williams, alternating between raiding and draining his alcohol stashes, personal interventions, and keeping oxygen tanks backstage, but Williams' health, as well as the quality of his performances, continued to decline and he refused to see a doctor.\n\nOtis Williams and the other Temptations decided to resort to enlisting an on-hand fill-in for Paul Williams. Richard Street, then-lead singer of fellow Motown act The Monitors and formerly lead singer of The Distants, was hired to travel with The Temptations and sing all of Williams' parts, save for Williams' special numbers such as \"Don't Look Back\" and \"For Once in My Life\", from backstage behind a curtain. When Williams was not well enough to go on, Street took his place onstage. In April 1971, Williams was finally persuaded to go see a doctor. The doctor found a spot on Williams' liver and advised him to retire from the group altogether. Williams left the group and Street became his permanent replacement. In support of helping Williams get back on his feet, The Temptations continued to pay Williams his same one-fifth share of the group's earnings, and kept Williams on their payroll as an advisor and choreographer, and Williams continued to help the group with routines and dance moves for the next two years.\n\nBy early 1973, Williams made his return to Motown's Hitsville USA recording studios, and began working on solo material. Kendricks, who had quit the Temptations just before Williams left, produced and co-wrote Williams' first single, \"Feel Like Givin' Up\", which was to have been issued on Motown's Gordy imprint with \"Once You Had a Heart\" as its b-side. However, after Williams' death was ruled a suicide in August 1973, Motown decided to shelve the sides, because the song \"Feel Like Givin' Up\" was just too literal to bear and the single was not released.\n\nOn August 17, 1973, Paul Williams was found dead in an alley in a car having just left the new house of his then-girlfriend after an argument. A gun was found near his body. His death was ruled a suicide by the coroner; Williams had expressed suicidal thoughts to Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin months before his death.\n\nWilliams' funeral was held on August 24, with his family and former bandmates in attendance. He was survived by his wife, Mary Agnes Williams, and five children: Sarita, Kenneth, Paula, Mary and Paul Jr. Paul Jr later joined a Temptations splinter group, The Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards. Williams also had three other children, Paul Williams Lucas, Anthony Johnson, and Derrick Vinyard, with three girlfriends. Williams is buried at Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery, Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan in Lot 275, Grave #4, Section #G.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Williams' death caused the Williams family to suspect that some form of foul play was the actual cause of Williams' death. According to the coroner, Williams had used his right hand to shoot himself on the left side of his head. In addition, a bottle of alcohol was found near Williams' left side, as if he had dropped it while being shot. The gun used in the shooting was found to have fired two shots, only one of which had killed Williams.\n\nAs a member of the Temptations, Paul Williams was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013. Both of his solo recordings were later released by Motown on Temptations-related compilations in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn 1998, NBC aired \"The Temptations\", a four-hour television miniseries based upon an autobiographical book by Otis Williams.

He lived in Paris, London, and Geneva, where he designed and built animated dolls, or automata, to help his firm sell watches and mechanical birds.\n\nConstructed between 1768 and 1774 by Pierre Jaquet-Droz, his son Henri-Louis (1752-1791), and Jean-Frédéric Leschot (1746-1824), the automata include \"The Writer\" (made of 6000 pieces), \"The Musician\" (2500 pieces), and \"The Draughtsman\" (2000 pieces).\n\nHis astonishing mechanisms fascinated the kings and emperors of Europe, China, India, and Japan.\n\nSome consider these devices to be the oldest examples of the computer. \"The Writer\", a mechanical boy who writes with a quill pen upon paper with real ink, has an input device to set tabs, defining individual letters written by the boy, that form a programmable memory. It has 40 cams that represent the read-only programme. The work of Pierre Jaquet-Droz predates that of Charles Babbage by decades.\n\nThe automata of Jaquet-Droz are considered to be some of the finest examples of human mechanical problem solving. Three particularly complex and still functional dolls, now known as the Jaquet-Droz automata, are housed at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire (art and history museum) in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.\n\nHe once constructed a clock that was capable of the following surprising movements:There were seen on it a negro, a dog, and a shepherd; when the clock struck, the shepherd played six tunes on his flute, and the dog approached and fawned upon him. This clock was exhibited to the King of Spain, who was delighted with it. \"The gentleness of my dog,\" said Droz, \"is his least merit; if your Majesty touch one of the apples, which you see in the shepherd's basket, you will admire the fidelity of this animal.\" The King took an apple, and the dog flew at his hand, and barked so loud, that the King's dog, which was in the room, began also to bark; at this the Courtiers, not doubting that it was an affair of witchcraft, hastily left the room, crossing themselves as they went out. The minister of Marine was the only one that ventured to stay. The king having desired him to ask the negro what o'clock it was, the minister obeyed, but he obtained no reply. Droz then observed, that the negro had not yet learned Spanish.\n\n\n\n__notoc__\n"}

At the age of 17, Hughes learned to play the drums, and when Scott and Rice-Oxley formed a small covers band in 1995 he was invited to join as drummer. They later invited future lead singer Tom Chaplin to join the band, although Hughes initially objected, later stating, \"The idea of giving someone who's already the loudest person you know a microphone was not something that I was particularly keen on.\"\n\nHughes then went to university at University College London where he received a degree in Geography. He took a job as a secretary at the BBC in order to support himself and the band while they lived and practiced in a flat on Upper Clapton Road in London. He also had a job as a supply teacher for a short time. It has been said that the song 'Put it Behind You' was written by Rice-Oxley for Hughes after he had broken up with a girlfriend, and that much of the album 'Perfect Symmetry' - in particular the track 'You Don't See Me' - was also written about him and his unrequited love for a music journalist who broke his heart by marrying another man. Hughes is known to be the most humorous member of the band. Since \"Under the Iron Sea\" was released he has provided additional backing vocals for the band. He was married, presumably to his long-time girlfriend, in 2010.\n\nHe is a Human Rights activist with Amnesty International. On 3 November 2011 Hughes spoke at the Oxford Union about his work with Amnesty International, and his campaign for justice for Troy Davis.\n\nHughes collects \"Nikon\" brand cameras and calls himself \"Nikon Guy\". He is a great lover of photography and updates the site Keane with \"photoblogs\" with photographs of the band on tour. He is a fan of the Irish rock band U2, and other bands and groups like The Smiths, The Beatles and Björk. His favorite song from the album \"Hopes and Fears\" is \"Bend and Break\" and \"Put It Behind You\" from Under the Iron Sea. Hughes is colourblind to green and brown, as said in a video where Richard answers 50 fan questions (can be found on the band's YouTube channel.)\n\nHughes uses Yamaha drums, Zildjian cymbals and Vic Firth drumsticks. He also used Sabian cymbals in the past. \n\nDrums: Yamaha absolute maple \n\nCymbals: Zildjian: \n\nKeane took the initiative to participate in War Child (foundation to help children in countries at war). Richard is an activist who defends human rights, together with Amnesty International. He is also very involved in the case of Troy Davis, sometimes wearing T-shirts with the message \"I am Troy Davis\" during his tour in the United States.

The military violently dispersed protest participants, and Samira and other women were beaten, given electric shocks, strip searched, and videotaped by the soldiers. They were also subjected to virginity tests. The tests were allegedly carried out to protect the soldiers from claims of rape.\n\nAfter succeeding in placing the case in front of a civilian court, a court order was issued in December 2011 to stop the practice of “virginity tests”. However, in March 2012, a military court exonerated Dr. Adel El Mogy from charges laid in connection with the virginity testing of Ibrahim.\n\nIbrahim vowed to take her case to the international courts.\n\nIn early March 2013, Ibrahim came under criticism after Samuel Tadros, writing in \"The Weekly Standard\", accused her of posting anti-Semitic and anti-American statements on her Twitter account. These statements included quoting Adolf Hitler, writing: \"I have discovered with the passage of days, that no act contrary to morality, no crime against society, takes place, except with the Jews having a hand in it. Hitler.” In reaction to a suicide bombing of a bus of Israelis in Bulgaria, she wrote \"Today is a very sweet day with a lot of very sweet news.” In 2012 on the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, she tweeted \"Today is the anniversary of 9/11.

She has used the pseudonym Ms. Marvel and has served as a member of the Fantastic Four and the female wrestlers known as the Grapplers.\n\nCreated by Mike Carlin and Ron Wilson, the character first appeared in \"Thing\" #27 (September 1985).\n\nSharon Ventura met Thing at the time when he was involved with the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation (UCWF). Inspired by him, she signed up for the Power Broker's program in order to have her strength augmented and join the UCWF. The Power Broker (actually Curtiss Jackson), employed Dr. Karl Malus to create super-powered wrestlers for his competitions. Sharon was unaware of the criminal activities of Jackson or Malus. While boosting their subjects' strength, the pair addicted the subjects to a drug, ensuring their obedience. It has been implied that she was raped while a prisoner of Malus, which caused her to temporarily develop an intense hatred and distrust of men. Sharon managed to break free before Malus administered the drug. She adopted the costume which UCWF minder Ann Fraley (Auntie Freeze) had arranged for her, taking the name Ms. Marvel. Alongside the Thing, she battled the Grapplers and the UCWF wrestlers. She then battled the She-Hulk.\n\nLater, Sharon was used by the Power Broker to determine if the augmentation could be reversed. Alongside Captain America, she battled the Power Broker.\n\nSharon later joined the Fantastic Four, and alongside the Fantastic Four she battled Diablo. Shortly after joining the Fantastic Four, Sharon was mutated by cosmic rays and took on strength and appearance similar to that of Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the Thing. Although she never officially retired her Ms. Marvel moniker, she became more popularly known as the She-Thing and it is by this name she is most known to comic book fans. She later first encountered Aron the Rogue Watcher, and battled the She-Hulk. With She-Hulk, She-Thing battled Dragon Man. With the Fantastic Four and Frightful Four, she was captured by Aron. They escaped and defeated their clones. Sharon later battled the Hulk. She-Thing was offered the chance to be human again by Doctor Doom while a then-powerless Ben Grimm chose to use one of Reed Richards' machines to revert to the Thing to save She-Thing. Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled the Time Variance Authority. She-Thing left the Fantastic Four soon after and began working for Doctor Doom. Sharon claimed to be doing this so that Doom would cure Ben as he had her. She was sent by Doctor Doom to spy on the Fantastic Four, where she first met Alicia Masters. With Mister Fantastic and the Thing, she was captured by Aron, but rescued by the Molecule Man and Doctor Doom. Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled the Secret Defenders. Alongside the Fantastic Four, Lyja, and the Inhumans, she battled Doctor Doom. When she refused to betray her friends in the Fantastic Four to Doctor Doom, Doom spitefully mutated her into a much more monstrous form. After a bout of insanity, she briefly joined the Frightful Four and battered Sue Storm Richards to within inches of her life. \n\nYears later, She-Thing had a guest appearance in \"Marvel Knight\"s 4, a spinoff of the main \"Fantastic Four\" book. The appearance established that she was indeed alive and well in the Marvel Universe and her attire implied she was still residing with Wingfoot. Her absence was poked fun at, as she stated that she couldn't believe anybody still had her number.\n\nSharon Ventura was later seen again in her She-Thing form.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, a Skrull impersonating Sharon's \"She-Thing\" persona is killed by the Skrull Kill Krew. The real Sharon is recovered alive from a downed Skrull ship after the final battle of the invasion. Sharon attends a support group meeting with the others who were replaced by Skrulls.\n\nSharon has since been revealed as a prisoner in the Raft, with evidence suggesting that she is part of a plot to destabilize the Fantastic Four.\n\nIn the post-Secret Wars Marvel Universe, Ms. Ventura has returned to her original human appearance, and has been seen wrestling in her original outfit.\n\nAs Ms. Marvel, Sharon had superhuman strength and endurance, thanks to augmentation of her physical attributes by Dr. Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker. The mutagenic effect due to exposure to cosmic radiation that turned her into the She-Thing later greatly increased her physical attributes and durability.\n\nSharon is highly proficient in hand-to-hand combat, and skilled at various martial arts, including tae kwon do and American boxing. She is also an expert stuntwoman, scuba diver, skydiver, motorcyclist, mountain climber, skier, lion tamer, and wrestler. She attended a military academy until she was expelled.\n\nAs part of Ben Grimm's Fantastic Four, she demonstrated her intelligence by solving complicated situations with her intuition and cunning.\n\nSharon Ventura's Ms. Marvel appearance appears as an alternate costume for Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) in \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "366537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=366537", "title": "Shinji Ikari", "text": "Shinji Ikari\n\nShinji's portrayal differs depending on the media in which he is shown such as in the official manga adaptation where he is written from the author Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's point of view as well as other spinoff series. Shinji became highly popular, having appeared and topped in multiple popularity polls. Nick Verboon of \"Unreality Mag\" states \"poster boy/protagonist Shinji is one of the most nuanced, popular, and relatable characters in anime history.\n\nDirector Hideaki Anno described the hero, Shinji Ikari, as a boy who \"shrinks from human contact\", and has \"convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person, so much so that he cannot even commit suicide.\" He describes Shinji and Misato Katsuragi as \"extremely afraid of being hurt\" and \"unsuitable — lacking the positive attitude — for what people call heroes of an adventure.\" When compared to the stereotypical hero, Shinji is characterized more by lack of energy and emotion than by heroism or bravery.\n\nShinji has an Oedipus complex, and is characterized by a libido-destrudo conflict.\n\nShinji's relationship with his Evangelion and status as a pilot is very ambivalent; the entire series can be seen as a bildungsroman revolving around Shinji.\n\nShinji has often been seen as a version or reflection of the creator of \"Evangelion\" and Anno has referred to the plot line as a metaphor of his life.\n\n\"Ikari\" means \"anchor\" in Japanese. Shinji was named for Gainax co-founder Shinji Higuchi; it can be translated to \"child of god.\" \"Evangelion\" character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto based his design of Shinji on his design of Nadia, the title character of Gainax's popular 1990-1991 TV series, \"\".\n\nMegumi Ogata, who voiced Shinji, found the last scene of \"End of Evangelion\" difficult to perform. Ogata regards Shinji Ikari as one of her \"most memorable\" roles.\n\nShinji makes his first appearance in the first episode where he is invited to Tokyo-3 by his father Gendo Ikari. Unbeknownst to Shinji however, his father told him to come so he could serve as the pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. Shinji reluctantly agrees and defeats the Angel Sachiel, initially experiencing difficulty, but brutally destroys the Angel after Unit-01 goes berserk. After the Angel attack, Shinji begins to attend school in Tokyo-3 and meets Toji Suzuhara and Kensuke Aida who would become his first true friends. When the Angel Ramiel appears and attempts to destroy Nerv headquarters, Shinji and fellow pilot Rei Ayanami work together to destroy the Angel. When a nuclear-powered machine intended to fight the Angels runs amok, he and his guardian Misato successfully stop it. Shinji later meets Asuka Langley Soryu, an eva-pilot from Germany, and the two successfully defeat Gaghiel.\n\nShinji, Rei and Asuka assault the explosive angel Sahaquiel, risking their lives to the extreme in order to do so. They defeat the Angel thanks mostly to Shinji's efforts. Shinji later gains supreme synchronization skill, causing Shinji to realize that he was born to pilot the Eva, and he receives praise from the commanding officers of NERV. Shinji, Rei and Asuka are later sent to fight the dark Angel Leliel, whose reverse AT field sucks Shinji into a parallel universe. Shinji confronts the Angel, during which he also confronts his inner self, forming arguments and philosophies. He is brutally freed from the powerful Angel through the intervention of his mother Yui, whose soul is within the Eva, which epically, gruesomely splits the Angel's massive body into two.\n\nAfter Shinji is forced to fight the Bardiel-controlled Eva-03 while Toji is trapped within, Shinji decides to quit Nerv. Zeruel soon appears and decapitates the other Evangelion units. Shinji realizes that only he can defeat it, and returns to NERV. Midway during the battle, however, Unit-01's power supply runs out, eventually causing Shinji to attain a 400% sync ratio with the unit, allowing him to continue his assault and frees the Evangelion in the process. As a result, he is trapped within its core for a month before being released. After Rei sacrifices herself to save Shinji and then is subsequently revived through one of her clones while Asuka becomes comatose, Shinji begins to suffer with depression. He meets Kaworu Nagisa and the two become friends. However, it is later revealed that Kaworu is in fact the final Angel and Shinji is forced to kill him, giving Shinji extreme mental trauma.\n\n\"The End of Evangelion\" continues Shinji's story, portraying his downward spiral into depression and eventual loss of the will to live. He is in this state for the majority of the film, remaining catatonic while all the NERV officers, including Misato, are killed. Shinji then decides to pilot the Eva to save those who are still alive, but a bakelite release ordered by Misato accidentally blocks the entrance of Unit-01. When Shinji learns of Asuka's defeat, the Evangelion moves on its own to let Shinji become the transcendent, powerful hero once again. Shinji's Ego cause the Eva's AT field to manifest in the form of gigantic, dreadful, divine wings. Despite this, after witnessing the mangled, mutilated corpse of Unit-02 being carried by the Mass Production Evas, Shinji's trauma becomes even worse as the Human Instrumentality Project begins. Shinji's intense emotion summons the Lance of Longinus stuck on the Moon all the way down to Earth. Shinji's Ego continues to resist Lilith-Rei and SEELE's assaults on his soul; but when Lilith-Rei takes the form of Kaworu Nagisa, Shinji's Ego weakens, as Yui's soul from inside the Eva tells Shinji that Rei is \"all of Shinji's hopes and dreams\". Lilith-Rei and SEELE ultimately defeat Shinji's Ego. The fusion of the Lance of Longinus with the Eva recreates a Tree of Life. Shinji and the Eva, now possessing both the Fruit of Wisdom and the Fruit of Life, become \"God\". Shinji, now one with all other humans, converses with them, particularly Rei and Kaworu. It is revealed that Shinji and Eva's absorption of a Fruit of Life and a Fruit of Wisdom meant that Eva, and the pilot inside, will continue to exist forever, \"even after the Sun, the Moon, and the planets are gone\". He eventually converses with Yui, whom he wonders what will do, until he finally decides that he wants to live and returns to Earth. Asuka appears next to him and Shinji attempts to strangle her for an un-clarified reason, but stops himself and breaks down after Asuka regains consciousness and caresses his face.\n\nIn \"Rebuild of Evangelion\" Shinji returns as the central protagonist in \"\", where he is shown to be more outspoken than his TV counterpart. In this film, Shinji's role is very much the same as that of the anime series. He is assigned to be the pilot of Unit-01 and works alongside Rei to defeat the Angel Ramiel. In \"\", Shinji continues his duties as pilot of Unit-01, albeit reluctantly. After the battle with Bardiel, wherein his father forced him to critically injure Asuka, Shinji retires from his duties and leaves NERV. When Zeruel consumes Rei, Shinji returns and defeats the Angel by seemingly fusing with the Evangelion. In \"\", set fifteen years later, Shinji is awakened to a changed world caused by the Third Impact which he started. Everyone treats Shinji poorly, except Kaworu. A clone of Rei now pilots Mark 09, aka The Vessel of Adams. After Shinji realizes that he did not save Rei, he and Kaworu pilot Eva-13, one of the Four Adams and the most powerful known Evangelion which the two operate. They attempt to erase Third Impact by using the spears of Longinus and Cassius allegedly lodged in Lilith, but instead start Fourth impact after Shinji pulls the two spears of Longinus out from Lilith, ignoring Kaworu and Asuka's warning. Eva-13 then eats the Twelfth Angel and ascends to divinity. However, Kaworu sacrifices himself to stop the Fourth Impact, leaving Shinji losing his will to live. The fourth film is yet to be released.\n\nShinji appears in most manga adaptations of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", including Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's manga adaptation. The manga generally follows the plot of the anime with occasional alterations in events. In this manga, Shinji's role is very similar to his anime counterpart, although changes in characterization are apparent. This is due to the fact the manga is written from Sadamoto's point of view involving Shinji. Sadamoto was inspired to write the manga after learning of Shinji's role in the first episode of the television series. Shinji is also a primary protagonist in \"\" and \"\" where he is portrayed in a different light than his anime counterpart.\n\nShinji, alongside other \"Evangelion\" characters, makes frequent appearances in video games, such as \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" for the Nintendo 64. Shinji is also a playable character in the popular cross-over video game franchise Super Robot Wars where he and other \"Evangelion\" characters work with characters from various other mecha series.\n\nShinji has received critical acclaim as a character. Shinji ranked 25th on IGN's first top 25 anime characters list. Editor Chris Mackenzie commented that the IGN staff loved him \"not for what he is, but for what he could be\". In 2014, IGN ranked him as the greatest anime character of all time, observing that he is a \"genuine work of art\", saying that heroes \"are often who we want to be\", and noting he was different from it: \"he was perhaps the most emotionally true-to-life character in anime history.\" In a \"Newtype\" poll from March 2010, Shinji was voted as the most popular male character from the 1990s. The 19th and the 20th \"Animage\" Grand Prix ranked him the best male character of the year.\n\nPete Harcoff, a reviewer for Anime Critic, gave a positive review of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" yet maintained a negative view of Shinji's character, stating that Shinji was ineffective and disappointing to watch. Shinji's role in the Rebuild of Evangelion films got a better response as he was noted to be friendlier with other characters in contrast to his role in the TV series. Theron Martin from Anime News Network listed the scene from \"\" in which Shinji saves Rei as the \"Best Scene\" in the site's feature \"The Best (and Most Notable) of 2011.\" Martin praised Shinji's determination in such scene as \"this is the first time in the entire franchise that he whole-heartedly goes after something because he \"wants\" it, rather than because he's expected to or has no choice.\"\n\nSpike Spencer, Shinji's English voice actor, has received praise for his role, particularly for his performance in \"The End of Evangelion\". Mike Crandol of Anime News Network praised the subtle nuances that Spencer brought to the role, as he felt that Spencer had improved over his previous performances where he tended to parody Shinji's inner turmoil. Pete Harcoff, while critical of Shinji's character, also complimented Spencer, stating that he delivered a solid performance as Shinji. Nick Verboon of \"Unreality Mag\" states \"poster boy/protagonist Shinji is one of the most nuanced, popular, and relatable characters in anime history.\n\n"}

She has been a featured singer on several albums of Garifuna music, and has toured internationally with the Belizean group \"Garifuna Collective\" and Garifuna Women's performance band \"Umalali\", one of the groups selected for performances at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. \n\nSofía Blanco Arzú was born in 1953 in Livingston, Guatemala to Virginia Arzú Norales and Anastasio Blanco Vargas. Her family heritage was Garifuna and she lived in the San José barrio of Livingston, near the home of noted paranda singer Ursino \"Fidu\" Cayetano. Unlike other Garifuna of her generation, she attended school, but left after fourth grade. From a young age, she participated in musical performances and developed an interest in preserving the music heritage of the Garifuna people. At the age of 20, she married the composer Gregorio Baltazar Roche, with whom she raised two children, Silvia and Gregorio Baltazar Blanco.\n\nThough she began singing in the paranda, by the 1980s, Blanco's voice and style were more suited to \"gayusa\", a call and response type of singing accompanied by a base drum and a flourishing drum providing rhythm with maracas punctuating the beat. Traditionally used for ritual songs and dance performances during the rites, the leader performs the call and is answered by the choir. She performed with the group \"Despertar Garífuna Marcos Sánchez Díaz\" (Marcos Sánchez Díaz Garifuna Awakening), which was a group dedicated to preserving and promoting Garifuna heritage. In 1992, Blanco produced a double album with the Guatemalan Tourism Institute (), which contained the music performed at the \"Primer Encuentro de Músicos de la Tradición Popular Garífuna\" (First Gathering of Musicians of the Garifuna Popular Tradition). In 1997, while performing with the Afro-Guatemalan Organization () in Belize, she met Ivan Duran of Stonetree Records, who produced the music of Andy Palacio.\n\nThrough that meeting, Duran was inspired to launch the Garifuna Women's Project, seeking out female performers and recording them. Because the women had not performed professionally before, Duran worked with Blanco and the others recording in venues where they were more comfortable than they were in a recording studio. For ten years, Blanco worked with Duran and Palacio to gather the traditions of Garifuna women in music, while continuing her international performance career. In 2006, she participated in the anniversary CD \"Ten Years of Stonetree\" and the following year, performed in the chorus for \"Wátina\", Palacio's last album. In 2008, \"Umalali: The Garifuna Women's Project\" was released by Stonetree and in the United States by the Cumbancha label. Among the songs Blanco performed on the album were \"Nibari\" (My Grandchild), with lyrics composed by her husband and her own lyrics written for \"Yunduya Weyu\" (The Sun Has Set). \"Nibari\" was the opening track of the album and earned Blanco praise as one of the \"Garifuna's most accomplished voice(s)\" and a comparison by Sarah Weeden of National Public Radio to the emotional performances of Edith Piaf. To promote the album and pay homage to Palacio, who died unexpectedly that same year, she toured with the Garifuna Collective giving performances in Los Angeles, Belize, and then across Europe for two months. \n\nThe reception of the album, sparked the creation of a band of the same name, \"Umalali\", which was composed of members from Palacio's Garifuna Collective, featuring Blanco, Desere Diego, and Chella Torres, as singers. In 2009, they toured in Canada. That same year, Blanco founded in Livingston, \"Iseri Laruga\" (New Dawn), a Garifuna youth music and dance troupe, which performs along the Caribbean coast and in central Guatemala. In 2010, the group was invited to Walt Disney World near Miami, Florida, to perform and she conducted a workshop on Garifuna music traditions in Guatemala City for artists from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Guatemala, and Panama. That same year, she toured with \"Umalali\" on a tour that began in Seattle, and held performances in San Diego and Chico, California, before appearing in New Hampshire and culminating in a performance at the Cultural Olympiad for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver. In 2011, Blanco collaborated with Aurelio Martínez on \"Laru Beya\" and was recognized by UNESCO as \"cultural ambassador and spokesperson for the Garifuna's musical heritage\". When she is not touring, she works in the family convenience store in Livingston and though she has considered stopping touring, she performed in Miami in 2018.\n\n"}

Suriya's performances in both films were praised, winning him a Best Actor nomination for the former and the Best Supporting Actor for \"Pithamagan\" at the 51st Filmfare Awards South. The following year, he played dual roles—a hunchback and a college student—in \"Perazhagan\". Suriya's performance was again praised, and he received his first Filmfare Best Actor award. He was also acclaimed for his performance as a student leader in Mani Ratnam's \"Aaytha Ezhuthu\" (2004).\n\nIn 2005, Suriya starred in three films: \"Maayavi\", \"Ghajini\" and \"Aaru\". His performance in \"Ghajini\" as a businessman with anterograde amnesia was widely praised. \"Maayavi\" and \"Aaru\" were moderately successful. Over the next two years, Suriya starred in \"Sillunu Oru Kaadhal\" (2006) and \"Vel\" (2007). Although the former was a box office bomb, \"Vel\", where he played twins, was commercially successful. Suriya's next appearance was in the romantic drama, \"Vaaranam Aayiram\" (2008). His dual role as father and son earned him another Filmfare Best Actor award.\n\nSuriya's next three films were \"Ayan\" (2009), \"Aadhavan\" (2009) and \"Singam\" (2010). The latter, in which he starred with Anushka Shetty, was his most commercially successful film to date and spawned two sequels: \"Singam II\" (2013) and \"Si3\" (2017). The actor made his Hindi and Telugu cinema debuts in Ram Gopal Varma's two-part gangster drama \"Rakta Charitra\" (2010). Suriya then played the Buddhist monk and creator of Shaolin Kung Fu, Bodhidharma, and his fictional descendant Aravind, in \"7aum Arivu\" (2011). His only 2012 release was \"Maattrraan\", in which he played conjoined twins. In 2015, Suriya released \"36 Vayadhinile\", the first film from his 2D Entertainment production company. He played three roles for the first time in Vikram Kumar's science fiction film, \"24\" (2016). It became one of the year's highest-grossing Tamil films and his performances earned him a Critics Award for Best Actor at Filmfare.\n\n\n"}
