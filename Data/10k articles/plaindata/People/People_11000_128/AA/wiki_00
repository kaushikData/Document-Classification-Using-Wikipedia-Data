He began painting at an early age, winning a prize at the age of 10 for his painting of 'Bamburgh Castle at sunset'. He had his first exhibition at the age of 18, at the local library in his home town, Ponteland, and has been taking commissions ever since. His watercolour paintings have been exhibited worldwide in the UK, Italy, the US and the Middle East.\n\nHe trained as an illustrator/graphic designer at Newcastle upon Tyne College of Art and Technology from 1978 to 1982. Although his course did not touch on watercolour in the first year as he was being trained in other mediums including acrylic and gouache, he practised using watercolours in his spare time. Early influences were established international artists including the American, Winslow Homer, who had lived at Cullercoats in the North east of England, not far from where Alan lives now. He also admired the work of Rowland Hilder, who he described as a master of cityscapes, John Singer Sargent and Sir William Russell Flint.\n\nHe left college with an HND in Applied Design and became self-employed in 1984 using the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. He also commenced a series of lecturing jobs at Newcastle College of Art and Technology, South Tyneside College, Derwentside College and Cleveland College of Art, covering a 20-year timescale. He opened his own Gallery of Fine Art in Eldon Garden, Newcastle in 1998 to 2002 and then went on to open his own studio in Ponteland.\n\nHe has been a member of the Fine Art Trade Guild for over 10 years.\nReed's work often includes street scenes. Newcastle upon Tyne is a source of inspiration and the city's football fans heading for St James Park football ground have been one of many local subjects. Scenes of Durham city, Northumberland castles and Norfolk are also amongst his extensive portfolio amassed over three decades of painting. He also has an array of images of Scotland, in particular Edinburgh and the east coastline and has exhibited on a regular basis in Scotland. For three successive years (1992,1993 and 1994) his work was shortlisted for the Sunday Times Watercolour Competition. In September 2010 Alan was 1st runner up in \"The Bath Prize\" with his original painting of \"The Royal Crescent, Bath\". His painting \"The Roman Baths by Torchlight\" was also highly commended. He has had a number of solo exhibitions since 1981 including those at the Mall Galleries in London and has been a regular exhibitor of rowing scenes in the Stewards' enclosure at the Henley Royal Regatta along with exhibitions in his native Newcastle.\n\nIn 1991 Alan was introduced to Italy by Susan; the holiday was to have a lasting effect on him. Impressed by the landscape, Alan subsequently travelled to various regions throughout the country from the Veneto to Piedmont, Tuscany, Umbria, the Amalfi Coast and Abruzzo. He has completed several commissions to paint famous towns and cities including San Gimignano, Florence and Venice. In 2005 he held an exhibition of his work entitled \"The Light\" in Marostica, which was featured on Italian television and local press.\n\nAlso in 2005 Reed was commissioned to paint two watercolours for a client in Oman. This became the catalyst for regular painting trips to The Gulf, including Dubai and Kuwait as well as Oman. common feature of his work in this region has been the dhows at rest in calm harbour waters, the distinctive Arabic architecture and the activity in the life of the Souks. Alan has enjoyed an ongoing relationship with the Bait Muzna Gallery in Muscat since 2007. He had a joint exhibition with landscape photographer Malcolm MacGregor titled \"Mystical Oman\" in April 2010 opened by his Highness Sayyid Tarik Al Said. sketch book studies of Oman have attracted significant interest and have been printed as a handmade leather bound limited edition reproduction sketch book featuring watercolours to celebrate Oman's 40th Renaissance.\n\nAlan was born in Corbridge, Northumberland, England, eldest son of Kenneth and Gillian Reed. Kenneth Reed is also an artist, specialising in paintings of golf courses. Alan's grandfather, Thomas Reed also painted and his great grandfather carved ship figureheads. Alan now lives in Ponteland, Northumberland where his gallery and studio are based within his own home. He married his wife Susan in 1993 and they have two children and three grandchildren. They both share strong family ethics and a Christian faith along with a unique bond following an operation on 27 June 2001 at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital. Susan needed a kidney transplant and although her mother was tested she was not compatible. Alan's kidneys were and he donated one of his own to Susan. story was featured on BBC 1's Songs of Praise on Sunday 5 November 2006.\n\nAlan's approach to painting is described in a book entitled \"Landscapes in Watercolour\" by Theodora Philcox, a lecturer in art at Warwickshire.

With no record of violence, he was arrested at 26 years old, wrongfully convicted, and incarcerated for 18 years before finally being exonerated and released. He was awarded $1.4 million for the time he spent imprisoned, and the prosecutor who put him in prison was ultimately disbarred for concealing exculpatory evidence and using false testimony in the case.\n\nGraves grew up in Brenham and is the oldest among his four other siblings in his family. He is a father with three children. He worked at Magnetic Instruments in Brenham for three years before moving to Austin to work as an assembly line worker at Dell. In the spring prior to his arrest, Graves lost his job at Dell and returned to Brenham.\n\nIn 1992, Graves was charged with and convicted of murdering a family of six people in Somerville, despite the lack of a motive or any physical evidence connecting Graves to the crime scene. In lieu of physical evidence, the conviction was based upon the testimony of Robert Carter, who later admitted he had committed the crime on his own, and was executed. Graves was twice scheduled for execution by lethal injection.\n\nGraves was imprisoned at the Allan B. Polunsky Unit. Following Graves' exoneration and release, he testified at a Senate subcommittee hearing about the conditions of his imprisonment, and following his testimony, Mother Jones declared the prison to be the second-worst in the United States.\n\nAfter 12 years on death row, Grave's conviction was overturned by a federal appeals court in 2006, yet he was not released until four years later.\n\nFollowing approval from district attorney Bill Parham, Graves was released from prison on October 27, 2010. In June 2011, Graves was awarded $1.4 million for the time he spent on death row under the Tim Cole Compensation Act. Following this, the prosecutor who had sent Graves to prison, Charles Sebesta, was disbarred on June 11, 2015, for withholding exculpatory evidence in Grave's case, and for using false testimony to secure the conviction.\n\nFollowing his release, Graves founded a scholarship, the Nicole B.

{"id": "3373624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3373624", "title": "Ashraf Pahlavi", "text": "Ashraf Pahlavi\n\nPrincess Ashraf ol-Molouk Pahlavi (, , 26 October 1919 – 7 January 2016) was the twin sister of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran (Persia), and a member of the Pahlavi Dynasty. She was considered the \"power behind her brother\" and was instrumental in the 1953 coup which led to him taking the throne. She served her brother as a palace adviser and was a strong advocate for women's rights. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, she lived in exile in France, New York, Paris and Monte Carlo and remained outspoken against the Islamic Republic.\n\nAshraf Pahlavi was born in Tehran on 26 October 1919, five hours after her brother Mohammad Reza. Her parents were Reza Pahlavi, a military commander, who would become the Shah of Persia, and Tadj ol-Molouk, the second of his four wives. She had 10 siblings and half-siblings.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Ashraf Pahlavi, her older sister Shams, and their mother were among the first significant Iranian women to cease wearing the traditional veil.\n\nAshraf Pahlavi was not permitted to attend university and instead was married in 1937, at the age of 18, to Mirza Khan Ghavam, whose family was politically allied with her father.\n\nIn 1953, Ashraf Pahlavi played an important role in Operation Ajax as the one who changed Mohammad Reza Shah's mind in giving consent to the CIA and SIS to start the operation. The Shah had originally opposed the operation and for a while resisted accepting it. In early 1953, she met with CIA agents who asked her to talk to her brother since she was the only one who was able to influence him. As historian Stephen Kinzer's book \"All the Shah's Men\" recounts, \"Ashraf was enjoying life in French casinos and nightclubs when one of [Kermit] Roosevelt's best Iranian agents, Assadollah Rashidian, paid her a call. He found her reluctant, so the next day a delegation of American and British agents came to pose the invitation in stronger terms. The leader of the delegation, a senior British operative named Norman Darbyshire, had the foresight to bring a mink coat and a packet of cash. When Ashraf saw these emoluments, Darbyshire later recalled, \"her eyes lit up and her resistance crumbled.\" By her own account, Pahlavi was offered a blank check if she agreed to return to Iran from her enforced exile in France, but refused the money and returned of her own accord.\n\nSome historians argue that the coup would have occurred with or without Ashraf Pahlavi's persuasion of her brother. In an \"International Journal of Middle East Studies\" article, writer Mark Gasiorowski states that the Shah \"was not consulted about the decision to undertake the coup, about its manner of execution, or about the candidate chosen to replace Mossadegh\" and that the coup was instead largely executed by the United States and others looking to undermine Mossadegh's leadership.\n\nAshraf Pahlavi was a strong supporter of women's rights in Iran and the world during her brother's reign. In 1967, Pahlavi worked with the United Nations as the Iranian delegate to the Commission on Human Rights as well as the Economic and Social Council. In 1975, she was heavily involved with the International Women's Year, and addressed the United Nations.\n\nThough an instrumental force in legitimizing gender reforms, her philosophy on gender was not particularly introspective: \"I confess that even though since childhood I had paid a price for being a woman, in terms of education and personal freedom, I had not given much thought to specific ways in which women in general were more oppressed than men.\" By her own account, she was a strong supporter of the rights of women to basic life necessities such as \"food, education, and health\" and was not a radical reformist. She cited \"chronic apathy\" from many governments as the underlying issue that prevented women's rights reforms from being implemented around the world.\n\nAshraf Pahlavi's women's rights stance was called into question after the publication of her 1976 \"The New York Times\" op-ed piece, \"And Thus Passeth International Women's Year.\" In a March 1976 article in \"The Nation\", writer Kay Boyle criticized Ashraf for her touting of International Women's Year as succeeding in widening the global vision of sisterhood, while approximately 4,000 of the Princess's own \"sisters\" were political prisoners in Iran with virtually no hope of a military trial.\n\nIn her 1980 memoirs, Pahlavi acknowledges the poor conditions of women in Iran and expresses concern, as she writes, \"the news of what was happening to Iran's women was extremely painful…[they] were segregated and relegated to second-class status…many were imprisoned or exiled.\"\nAdditionally, Pahlavi worked as an activist for human rights and equality. She was an advocate for the international spread of literacy, especially in Iran, where her brother Mohammad Reza Shah was a major proponent of the anti-illiteracy movement. She served as a member on the International Consultative Liaison Committee for Literacy.\n\nAshraf Pahlavi was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt in the summer of 1977 at her summer home on the French Riviera, during which fourteen bullets were fired into the side of her Rolls Royce automobile. Her Lady-in-waiting was killed but Pahlavi left the scene unharmed.\n\nAfter the 1979 revolution, Ashraf Pahlavi asked David Rockefeller to support her brother Mohammad Reza's attempts to find asylum.\n\nShe also attacked U.S President Jimmy Carter and the United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim for not giving their support to her late brother the Shah during the start of the Revolution.\n\nIn 1994 she attended the funeral of former president Richard Nixon.\n\nAshraf Pahlavi argued that she was \"attacked for financial misconduct\" because she was engaged \"in the administration of various organizations\". By her own account, she was of limited financial means when Mossadegh sent her into exile in Paris. However, in later years she was said to have accumulated a large fortune. She attributed her wealth to increases in the value of lands that she had inherited from her father Reza Shah, and income from inherited businesses. Nevertheless, it has been purported that part of the story behind the build up of her fortune may have been that during the Iranian industrial boom, which was driven by a surge in oil prices, Pahlavi and her son Shahram took 10% or more of a new company's stock gratis in return insuring (sic) the delivery of a license to operate, to import, to export, or to deal with the government. Government licenses were said to be given only to a few well-connected companies in each field. As a result, the need to get and keep a license became a cost that had to be met.\n\nIn 1979, \"The New York Times\" reported that a document dated 17 September 1978 from Ashraf's office requested a transfer of $708,000 from her Bank Melli account to her account at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Geneva under the code name 'Sapia'.\n\nIn 1980, Pahlavi published an article in \"The New York Times\", in which she came out in defense of herself and her family's financial situation. In the article, she argued that her wealth was not accumulated through \"ill-gotten gains\" and attributed her fortune to inherited land, which \"drastically increased in value with the development of Iran and the new prosperity that was there for all\". She noted that many other Iranians profited from the sale of their own real estate, but were not accused of financial misconduct because of close ties to the clergy and Khomeini. She also defended her brother, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, stating that, contrary to the claims made by some Khomeini supporters, the Shah did not profit from the Pahlavi Foundation. The Princess wrote that she planned to \"fight these slanders with all my means and through whatever judicial means are available.\"\n\nPsychologically, Ashraf Pahlavi had low self-esteem when she was younger. She did not like \"what she saw in the mirror.\" She \"wished for someone else's face,…, fairer skin, and more height.\" She always imagined that \"there were so few people in this world shorter than I.\" Perhaps this motivated her to be bold. In her memoirs she wrote:\n\nHer brother, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (Mohammad Reza Shah) was her closest friend. In her memoirs, she remembers looking upon him with a sense of wonder as a child, writing, \"long before we reached adulthood, his voice became the dominant one in my life.\"\n\nSome sources mention a connection between her and drug trafficking; she said: \"My detractors have accused me of being a smuggler, a spy, a Mafia associate (once even a drug dealer)\".\n\n\nPahlavi's first marriage was to Mirza 'Ali Muhammed Khan Ghavam, Nasir ud-Daula (1911–?). They were married in March 1937 and divorced in 1942. Ghavam was the Assistant Military Attaché for Iran in 1941 in Washington DC and the eldest son of H.H. Mirza Ibrahim Khan Ghavam, Qavam ul-Mulk. She had one son from her first marriage, H.H. Prince (Vala Gohar) Shahram Pahlavi-Nia (born 18 April 1940, Tehran). In 1966 he married 16-year-old Niloufar Afshar, and the couple had one son, Cyrus, in 1969. Pahlavi-Nia had another son, Amir Ebrahim (born 1974) out of wedlock with Naz Alam, a daughter of the Shah's longtime minister of court and confidante, Asadollah Alam. In 1987 Shahram and Naz had an Islamic marriage ceremony in the US Virgin Islands.\n\nPavlavi's second marriage was to (Sahib ul-Izza) Ahmed Chafik Bey (21 September 1911 – 1976). He was the director-general of Civil Aviation and fourth son of H.E. (Hazrat Sahib ul-Sa'ada) Ahmad Shafiq Pasha, the minister of the Khedivial Court of Egypt. They married in 1944 in Cairo, and divorced in 1960; he went on to a second marriage to Deloris Pianezzola, and died of cancer in 1976, in Tehran. They had two children, Captain H.H. Prince (Vala Gohar) Shahriar Mustapha Chafik (15 March 1945 – 7 December 1979), assassinated in Paris, and H.H. Princess (Vala Gohari) Azadeh Pahlavi-Chafik (1951–2011).\n\nPahlavi married a third and final time on 5 June 1960 (at the Iranian Embassy in Paris) to Mehdi Bushehri (1916–?), who was the Director of the Maison d'Iran (House of Iran), Paris. They had no children together, and were often separated while Pahlavi lived in exile in New York City and Mehdi Bushehri remained in Paris.\n\nIn a 1980 interview with \"The New York Times\" journalist Judy Klemesrud, Pahlavi stated, \"I have never been a good mother. Because of my way of life, I was not with my children very much\".\n\nAfter the Revolution Princess Ashraf divided her time between Beekman Place which she sold before moving to Park Avenue in New York City, Paris and in Juan-les-Pins, on the French Riviera.\n\nPrincess Ashraf Pahlavi died on 7 January 2016 in Monte Carlo at the age of 96. She had suffered from Alzheimer's disease. Her death was announced by her nephew and the imperial family's head, Reza Pahlavi on his Facebook page.\n\nRobert F. Armao, an adviser, said the cause was \"old age\". Armao related that Princess Ashraf died in her sleep at home in Europe, but declined to name the country, citing concern for the safety of her family.\n\nHer funeral took place on 14 January 2016 in the Cimetière de Monaco in Monaco, attended by members of the Pahlavi family, including Empress Farah Pahlavi.\n\nAt the time of her death, she was the oldest living member of her family.\n\nAshraf Pahlavi wrote two books in English:\n\nAdditionally, she wrote one book in French:\n\nHer three books were published following her 1980 \"The New York Times\" article \"I Will Fight These Slanders\". In accordance with her promise to fight the \"slanders\" about her and her family, her books are largely concerned with clearing up what she viewed as misconceptions about the Pahlavi dynasty. She again addresses the questions about her personal financial situation, writing in her most widely read book, her memoir \"Faces in a Mirror\", \"I had inherited about $300,000 when my father died (and about 1 million square meters of land near the Caspian Sea, as well as properties in Gorgan and Kermanshah, which would later become extremely valuable)\" In the introduction to this book, Pahlavi writes that she wants \"very much to explain to Western readers what they have failed to understand about the nature of Iran's culture and heritage…about the nature of the so-called Islamic revolution\", Generally, her books are viewed as too autobiographical and steeped in emotion to be used as serious historical references: \"The Library Journal\" called Pahlavi's \"Faces in a Mirror\", \"little more than a personalized homily on the Pahlavis' virtues and the perfidy of nearly everyone else in the world.\"\n\nBefore the 1979 revolution, Pahlavi translated several books from French into Persian, including books on nursing and child care.\n\n\n\n"}

According to one article, \"every decade brings a new Brit Pack, another disparate group of actors backed by the media to achieve simultaneous Hollywood stardom.\" However, the term is most closely associated with the crop of British actors which emerged in the late 1980s, because of the prominence of the American Brat Pack actors at that time.\n\nThe journalist Elissa Van Poznak interviewed Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, Paul McGann, Bruce Payne, Spencer Leigh, and Colin Firth for \"The Face\" magazine, in January 1987. The magazine had also intended to interview Daniel Day-Lewis but he was busy filming \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\". The title of the interview was \"The Brit Pack\". The moniker stuck and has been referenced in subsequent articles concerning the actors. An issue of the 1988 magazine Film Comment stated that 'Rupert Everett, Gary Oldman, Miranda Richardson, and Daniel Day-Lewis' were the leaders of the pack.\n\nIn July 1993, an article for \"The Face\" was titled \"The New Brit Pack\", which included Jaye Davidson, Naveen Andrews, Jude Law, David Thewlis, Craig Kelly, Samuel West and Rufus Sewell.\n\nUnlike the Brat Pack or other similarly defined groups of American actors, \"Brit Pack\" actors have rarely associated with each other socially or in film. As a 1988 article put it, the Brit Pack \"aren't seen together at parties or in restaurants or in gossip columns. And since British cinema has had no equivalent to Hollywood's Eighties conveyor-belt youth movies – \"Weird Science\", \"About Last Night...\", \"St. Elmo's Fire\", et al. – they don't keep re-meeting each other on-screen either\". Nonetheless, Bruce Payne and Tim Roth had both appeared in the \"Tales Out of School\" television series, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth both appeared in \"Meantime\" and \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\", Gary Oldman and Colin Firth appeared together in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Bruce Payne and Spencer Leigh both appeared in \"Smart Money\".\n\nCurrently, the phrase 'Brit Pack' is often used to describe any disparate group of young British actors and actresses of rising prominence. No group has emerged which is as readily identifiable as the group from the 1980s.\n\nIn 2014, it was used to describe a new wave of actors born in the late 1970s and early 1980s who were garnering success in Hollywood. These actors include Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston, Henry Cavill, James McAvoy, Tom Hardy, Eddie Redmayne and Rupert Friend.\n\n"}
{"id": "58712831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58712831", "title": "Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales", "text": "Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales\n\nThe coat of arms of the Prince of Wales is the official heraldic insignia of the Prince of Wales, a title traditionally granted to the heir apparent to the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, formerly the Kingdom of Great Britain and before that the Kingdom of England.\n\nThe coat of arms, in its current form, was devised for Charles, Prince of Wales in 1958. It contains the badges and elements taken from all four of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom as well as from the many titles the prince holds as heir apparent.\n\nThe history of the coat of arms is closely linked with that of the Royal coat of arms of England and the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. However, as the noted antiquarian and heraldist Charles Boutell wrote in 1863, \"The Arms of the Prince of Wales have a distinct individuality of their own, with which nothing ought to be directly associated.\"\n\nThe coronets of the Prince and the Peers of the realm were regulated by King Charles II by Royal Warrant, signed on 9 February 1661. Part of the warrant proclaimed: \"Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, That the Son and Heir Apparent of the Crown for the time being, shall use and bear his Coronet composed of Crosses and Flower-de-Lized with one Arch; and in the midst a Ball and Cross, as hath our Royal Diadem\".\n\nIn other words, the heraldic coronet used in the Prince of Wales's coat of arms is similar to the heraldic crown (St. Edward's crown) used in the Royal arms, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has only one. Boutell wrote that: \"It should be noticed, however, that this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the Sovereign and heir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales\". The coronet is also used by the Prince of Wales's consort, in her coat of arms.\n\nThe heir's coronet was confirmed in another Royal Warrant signed on 19 November 1917 by King George V. The warrant proclaimed: \"by the son and heir apparent of the sovereign and his successors a coronet composed of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch and in the midst a ball and cross as in the royal crown.\"\n\nCurrently there are three physical examples of coronets used at one time or other as part of the Honours of the Principality of Wales; the Coronet of Frederick, the Coronet of George and the Coronet of Charles. However these physical manifestations have not affected the graphical representation of the coronet in heraldic art.\n\nBeginning with the reign of King Edward I, a label of three points Azure (or blue) was used by his son, the future King Edward II, to differentiate his arms from those of his father. Without such a label their arms would be identical. Within heraldry this system of differentiating arms is called cadency. The label is placed on the chief (or top) of the shield of arms, with the ends extending across from the dexter to the sinister sides of the shield. It was Prince Edward the Black Prince, heir of King Edward III, who first used a label of three points Argent, also white or silver. This has been the label of the heir apparent ever since, without regard to the system of cadency used by other members of the royal family.\n\nThe Prince of Wales's crest follows closely that of the Sovereign, but always with the appropriate label of difference displayed. This crest depicts a \"Lion Or, passant guardant, wearing a coronet of the Heir, and differenced on the shoulders with a label of three points Argent.\" The lion always stands on a larger coronet of the Heir, which then sits on a golden helmet or the Royal Helm. From the sides flow the gold and ermine mantling of the royal family.\n\nSimilarly to the crest, the prince's supporters follow those of the Sovereign. On either side of the shield of arms and standing on gold scrollwork are the royal supporters: the Lion and the Unicorn. Both beasts have the prince's label charged around their necks, again as an appropriate mark of difference. The lion on the dexter side, an ancient symbol of England, is crowned with the coronet of the Heir. The beast has been a supporter of the English royal arms since the reign of King Henry VIII. The white unicorn of Scotland on the sinister side, was incorporated into the royal arms from the Scottish royal arms after the Union of the crowns in 1603.\n\nPrince Charles was appointed a Knight of the Garter in 1958. Since the founding of the Order in 1348, almost every Prince of Wales has been appointed to the Order. The Order of the Garter is represented in the coat of arms by its namesake the blue buckled garter, which bears in gold letters the motto, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense\", French for \"Shame upon him who thinks evil of it\".\n\nUnder the coat of arms is a scroll bearing the motto \"Ich dien\", German for \"I serve\". The motto of uncertain origin first appeared on the arms of Edward of Woodstock, or the Black Prince. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales by his father King Edward III on 12 May 1343. Legend holds that the Black Prince took the motto as well as the ostrich feathers from King John the Blind of Bohemia, who was killed fighting alongside the prince and his father at the Battle of Crécy in 1346. The motto is also a near homophone for \"Eich Dyn\", \"Your Man\" in Welsh.\n\nThe Prince of Wales as part of his full achievement of arms has many Heraldic badges, which represents the history and sovereignty of his many titles.\n\nThe Prince of Wales's feathers badge comprises \"A plume of three ostrich feathers Argent enfiled by a royal coronet of alternate crosses and fleur-de-lys Or\" with the motto 'Ich Dien' on a dark blue ribbon. The badge is probably the most recognisable element of the Prince of Wales's coat of arms. It has become synonymous as a personal insignia of the prince and also of the Principality of Wales itself. In a personal capacity the badge is granted as a Royal Warrant of Appointment to companies that regularly supply of goods and services to the Prince. Currently there are 170 companies which are entitled to display this badge with the words 'By Appointment to HRH The Prince of Wales' underneath. The badge can be depicted on all premises, delivery vehicles, stationery and advertisements as well as on the individual products themselves. Other organisations associated with Wales or the prince incorporate the badge into their own insignia including many Welsh regiments of the British Army (such as the Royal Regiment of Wales) and the Welsh Rugby Union.\n\nFeathers used as either a crest or a badge have been an ancient heraldic badge of the House of Plantagenet. However it was not until its incorporation into the heraldic achievements of the Black Prince that the feathers have become an omnipresent feature of the coats of arms of the Prince of Wales.\n\nOn 10 December 1901 a warrant signed by King Edward VII approved the addition of a badge of the Red Dragon to the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales. The proclamation stated that: \"on the sinister side a representation of the Badge of Wales, namely, on a mount vert a Dragon, passant gules, differenced (as in the Crest) with a label of three points argent.\" This was to complement the feathers badge, which was to be depicted on the dexter side of the prince's crest.\n\nThe Red Dragon, or \"Y Ddraig Goch\", has been a symbol associated with Wales since the time of Cadwaladr, King of Gwynedd in the 7th century. It was not until the beginning of the House of Tudor that the Red Dragon became a royal badge of the kings of England. Henry Tudor (later King Henry VII) displayed the Dragon of Cadwaladr on his battle standard. The red dragon became an official royal badge of the sovereign (representing Wales) according to a warrant issued in 1801. The warrant at the same time also confirmed the Tudor rose as a royal badge for England, the thistle for Scotland and the golden harp for Ireland.\n\nThe arms of the Duke of Cornwall are: \"Sable, fifteen bezants, five, four, three, two and one.\" These arms were derived from those of Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans, son and heir of King John, who was also Count of Poitiers (or Poitou), represented by arms made up of peas (poix) or gold coins.\n\nUpon the accession of the prince's mother as Queen Elizabeth II on 6 February 1952, Prince Charles was automatically made the Duke of Cornwall. As such he is able to display the arms of the duchy on his coat of arms. This title has been granted to every heir apparent since 17 March 1337, in accordance with a charter issued by King Edward III for Prince Edward the Black Prince, his eldest son and heir.\n\nThe family of the Prince of Wales is entitled to use certain heraldic features. The consort of the Prince of Wales (titled the Princess of Wales) is granted a unique coat of arms upon marriage, based on the impaling of the prince's arms (on the dexter side) and her father's arms (on the sinister side). The consort is also entitled to use the prince's supporters (with the appropriate label) and the use of the prince's coronet over the arms. The current consort; Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, was granted a coat of arms on 17 July 2005 upon her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales.\n\nThe children of the heir apparent were given their own distinct coronet, unlike any other grandchildren of the sovereign. This was confirmed in the 1917 Royal Warrant, which proclaimed: \"to all the sons and daughters of the son and heir apparent of us and of our successors a coronet composed of two crosses pattée (or crosses formy) four fleurs-de-lis and two strawberry leaves.\" The wives of the sons of the Prince of Wales use the same coronet as their husbands. Such as arms borne by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, which was granted to her in 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

The brothers presented illusions that they and others claimed to be supernatural.\n\nThe Davenports began in 1854, less than a decade after Spiritualism had taken off in America. After stories of the Fox sisters, the Davenports started reporting similar occurrences. Their father took up managing his sons and the group was joined by William Fay, a Buffalo resident with an interest in conjuring. Their shows were introduced by a former \"Restoration Movement\" minister, Dr. J. B. Ferguson, a follower of Spiritualism, who assured the audience that the brothers worked by spirit power rather than deceptive trickery. Ferguson was apparently sincere in his belief that the Davenports possessed spiritual powers.\n\nThe Davenports' most famous effect was the box illusion. The brothers were tied inside a box which contained musical instruments. Once the box was closed, the instruments would sound. Upon opening the box, the brothers were tied in the positions in which they had started the illusion. Those who witnessed the effect were made to believe supernatural forces had caused the trick to work.\n\nThe Davenports toured the United States for 10 years and then traveled to England where spiritualism was beginning to become popular. Their \"spirit cabinet\" was investigated by the Ghost Club, who were challenging their claim of being able to contact the dead. The result of the Ghost Club's investigation was never made public. In 1868 the team was joined by Harry Kellar. Kellar and Fay eventually would leave the group to pursue their own career as a magician team.\n\nThe Davenport brothers were exposed as frauds many times. The stage magician John Nevil Maskelyne saw how the Davenports' spirit cabinet illusion worked, and stated to the audience in the theatre that he could recreate their act using no supernatural methods. With the help of a friend, cabinet maker George Alfred Cooke, he built a version of the cabinet. Together, they revealed the Davenport Brothers' trickery to the public at a show in Cheltenham in June 1865.\n\nMagicians including John Henry Anderson and Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin worked to expose the Davenport Brothers, writing exposés and performing duplicate effects. A pair of amateur magicians followed the brothers around Britain, tying the Davenports into their box with a knot that could not be easily removed and thus exposed the trick to audiences who demanded their money back. The impresario P. T. Barnum included an exposé of the Davenports in his 1865 book \"The Humbugs of the World\".\n\nThe Davenports were rejoined by William Fay for a final American tour before William Henry's death in 1877. Fay settled in Australia and Ira Erastus lived in America until the two reunited in 1895 and toured with a show that failed.\n\nThe magician John Mulholland also exposed the tricks of the Davenport brothers:\n\nA number of things immediately become less miraculous when it is known at times the Davenports employed as many as ten confederates. It was a night when a confederate was used that Alexander Herrmann (the stage magician known as Herrmann the Great) described in an article in the \"Cosmopolitan Magazine\". The performance was being given in Ithaca, New York, and many Cornell College students were in the audience. They had brought \"pyrotechnic balls so made as to ignite suddenly with bright light.\" When the lights were struck the Davenports were found to be on opposite sides of the stage waving musical instruments around in the air.\n\nAccording to the magician Harry Houdini, Ira had confessed to him that he and his brother had faked their \"spirit\" phenomena. Houdini in his book \"A Magician Amongst the Spirits\" (1924) also reproduced a letter from Ira claiming \"we never in public affirmed our Belief in spiritualism.\" The spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle refused to accept the exposures of fraud, and insisted that in private Ira was a practicing spiritualist.\n\nIn 1998, skeptical investigator Joe Nickell discovered the Davenport's scrapbook from the museum at the Lily Dale Spiritualist Assembly. Nickell examined newspaper clippings, personal notes and photographs from the scrapbook. He concluded that Doyle was correct about Ira endorsing spiritualism in private and Houdini was also correct about their public \"spirit\" phenomena being the result of trickery. According to Nickell \"taken as a whole, the evidence of the scrapbook does indicate that Ira Davenport was a practicing spiritualist, or at least pretended to be, although he and his brother used trickery to accomplish the effects they attributed to spirits.\"\n\n\n"}

He is widely regarded for his expertise in the fields of design, usability engineering, and cognitive science. Norman was also part of a select team flown in to investigate the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. He is also a co-founder and consultant with the Nielsen Norman Group.\n\nMuch of Norman's work involves the advocacy of user-centered design. His books all have the underlying purpose of furthering the field of design, from doors to computers. Norman has taken a controversial stance in saying that the design research community has had little impact in the innovation of products, and that while academics can help in refining existing products, it is technologists that accomplish the breakthroughs. To this end, Norman named his website with the initialism \"JND\" to signify his endeavors to make a difference.\n\nNorman had been splitting his time between co-directing the dual-degree MBA and Engineering program at Northwestern University and consulting with the Nielsen Norman Group. Norman announced that he would no longer teach full-time after the 2009–2010 academic year.\n\nNorman is an active Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where he spends two months a year teaching. He also holds the title of Professor Emeritus of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nHe is on numerous educational, private, and public sector advisory boards, including the editorial board of \"Encyclopædia Britannica\".\n\nIn 2014, Norman returned to the University of California, San Diego as newly appointed director of The Design Lab.\n\nIn 1957, Norman received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from MIT. Norman continued through college until 1962, in the process earning M.S. in EECS and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Mathematical Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter graduating, Norman took up a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University and within a year became a lecturer.\n\nAfter four years with the Center, Norman took a position as an associate professor in the Psychology Department at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Norman applied his training as an engineer and computer scientist, and as an experimental and mathematical psychologist, to the emerging discipline of cognitive science. Norman eventually became founding chair of the Department of Cognitive Science and chair of the Department of Psychology.\n\nAt UCSD, Norman was a founder of the Institute for Cognitive Science and one of the organizers of the Cognitive Science Society (along with Roger Schank, Allan Collins, and others), which held its first meeting at the UCSD campus in 1979.\n\nTogether with psychologist Tim Shallice, Norman proposed a framework of attentional control of executive functioning. One of the components of the Norman-Shallice model is the supervisory attentional system.\n\nNorman made the transition from cognitive science to cognitive engineering by entering the field as a consultant and writer. His article \"The truth about Unix: \"The user interface is horrid\"\" in \"Datamation\" (1981) catapulted him to a position of prominence in the computer world. Soon after, his career took off outside of academia, although he still remained active at UCSD until 1993. Norman continued his work to further human-centered design by serving on numerous university and government advisory boards such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). He currently serves on numerous committees and advisory boards like at Motorola, the Toyota National College of Technology, TED Conference, Panasonic, \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", and many more.\n\nNorman published several important books during his time at UCSD, one of which, \"User Centered System Design\", obliquely referred to the university in the initials of its title.\n\nIn 1993, Norman left UCSD to join Apple Computer, initially as an Apple Fellow as a User Experience Architect (the first use of the phrase \"User Experience\" in a job title), and then as the Vice President of the Advanced Technology Group. He later worked for Hewlett-Packard before joining with Jakob Nielsen to form the Nielsen Norman Group in 1998. He returned to academia as a professor of computer science at Northwestern University, where he was co-director of the Segal Design Institute until 2010. In 2014, he returned to UCSD to become director of the newly established The Design Lab housed at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology.\n\nNorman has received many awards for his work. He received an honorary degree from the University of Padua in Padua, Italy. In 2001 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, and in 2006 he received the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science. In 2009 Norman was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Design Research Society.\n\nIn his book \"The Design of Everyday Things\", Norman uses the term \"user-centered design\" to describe design based on the needs of the user, leaving aside what he deems secondary issues like aesthetics. User-centered design involves simplifying the structure of tasks, making things visible, getting the mapping right, exploiting the powers of constraint, designing for error, explaining affordances and seven stages of action. In addition, Norman discusses the closely related term \"human-centered design\" at length.\n\nIn his book The Things that Make us Smart: Defending the Human Attribute in the Age of the Machine, Norman uses the term “Cognitive Artifacts” to describe “those artificial devices that maintain, display, or operate upon information in order to serve a representational function and that affect human cognitive performance”. Similar to his The Design of Everyday Things book, Norman argues for the development of machines that fit our minds, rather than have our minds be conformed to the machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Foster (November 5, 1839 – December 23, 1902) was a major in the 7th Missouri State Militia Cavalry during the American Civil War. Afterwards he was a St. Louis, Missouri newspaper editor who fought a duel with rival editor and former Confederate John N. Edwards.\n\nFoster was born in Greene County, Missouri.\n\nHe was a staunch Unionist whose brother Marshall was murdered by secessionists in early 1861 on his way to vote. During the American Civil War, on Emory formed a Unionist Home Guard company called \"Foster's Mounted Rangers\" in which he served as captain, enlisting on August 28, 1861. He later enlisted in the Federally funded Missouri State Militia, being elected major of the 7th MSM Cavalry. He and his men engaged in skirmishes around his new home in Warrensburg, Missouri and Foster gained a reputation as an aggressive commander.\n\nOn August 15, 1862 after a two-day march from Warrensburg, Missouri to Lexington, Missouri, he was ordered to take 800 men on a 20-mile march to Lone Jack, Missouri to engage Confederate troops that were attempting to capture Jackson County, Missouri in what would become the Battle of Lone Jack.\n\nUpon arrival, Foster's force encountered an 800-1,600 man sleeping Confederate recruiting force under Colonel John T. Coffee and Lieutenant Colonel John Charles Tracy and routed them. However, the firing of Foster's artillery alerted other Confederate recruiting commands in the area of his presence and intent. Confederates under Colonels Vard Cockrell, Upton Hays, and DeWitt C. Hunter were joined by Lt. Col. Tracy and a fierce five-hour battle ensued the next morning. The Federals withdrew after Foster was wounded and Col. Coffee's command joined Cockrell.\n\nFoster and his brother were severely wounded, unable to withdraw, and were taken to a cabin. The cabin was captured by the Confederates and Foster was about to be executed by a member of Quantrill's Raiders when an 18-year-old Cole Younger physically threw the gunman out sparing Foster and his brothers life. They gave $1,000 and their handguns to Younger who then delivered them to the Foster sons' mother in Warrensburg (all despite Younger's being a member of the Confederates).\n\nIn 1876, Younger as a member of the James-Younger Gang was captured in the botched Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery. Foster was to forcefully argue for a parole for Younger in the 1890s. Also arguing for the parole was future Secretary of War Stephen Benton Elkins whose only taste of combat had been at Lone Jack, an experience which he said filled him with disgust of war.\n\nAfter the war he became an editor at the St. Louis Journal.\n\nOn September 4, 1875 he fought a duel north of Rockford, Illinois with Edwards, who was then an editor of the St. Louis Times (after leaving the Kansas City Times in 1873).\n\nThe dispute had centered on an August 25 article by Edwards talking about the mistreatment of Jefferson Davis at the Winnebago County, Illinois Fair. The Journal replied the same day \"the writer of the Times article had lied, and knew he lied, when he wrote it.\"\n\nEdwards demanded a retraction and Foster refused saying the editorial was not directed at Edwards personally. On August 30 Edwards challenged Foster to a duel:\n\nTheir seconds made the arrangements and at 5 pm the two met in a field and both missed as Foster smoked a cigar. Foster commented, \"A little high.\"\n\nEdwards demanded a second fire, \"I will go on if it takes a thousand fires.\"\n\nFoster refused a second fire.

In 1906, he started writing in socialist and academic journals, mainly on economic subjects, but also on other topics. Before World War I he gained some fame by discussing with Otto Bauer about the origins of inflation in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In this period he belonged to the Marxist Centrists, of whom Karl Kautsky and Rudolf Hilferding were the most prominent spokesmen.\n\nHe participated as minister of finance in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919. After the overthrow of the Soviet Republic he fled to Vienna.\n\nIn 1920 he went to the Soviet Union, where he started working for the Comintern, specializing in international economic problems and agrarian questions. In years 1922-1927 he was working at the department of trade in the Soviet embassy in Berlin. In the 1930s he became an economic adviser to Joseph Stalin. He survived the purges of the 1930s.\n\nDuring World War II he advised the Soviet Government in matters of post-war reparations. He attended the Potsdam Conference of 1945 as an expert. Like most of his compatriots living and working in Moscow, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but he also remained active in the Hungarian Communist Party.\n\nHe authored the economic reports the congresses of the Comintern discussed between 1921 and 1935. A large number of his writings were studies of the international economic conjuncture, in which he made great effort to assess quantitative trends in output, investment and employment using official economic data from numerous countries. He also extensively studied German imperialism.\n\nIn 1946 he published \"The Economic Transformation of Capitalism at the End of the Second World War\", in which he argued that the capitalist system was more inherently stable than had been hitherto believed. This led to the closure of the Institute which he headed. (See: Paolo Spriano, \"Stalin and the European Communists\". London: Verso, 1985). Finally, in 1949 he would make his self-criticism. Though he remained a leading academic economist, his prestige had diminished. In the second edition of the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" he was qualified as a \"bourgeois economist.\"\n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, he reappeared on the scene, but the new men in power in the Kremlin believing in the virtues of peaceful co-existence were not interested in Varga's predictions of the outbreak of a \"necessary\" economic crisis in the United States. In 1954 and 1959 he received the Lenin Orders, in 1954 he obtained a Stalin Prize and in 1963 a Lenin Prize. After his death, his selected works in three volumes were published in the Soviet Union, Hungary, and East Germany.\n\nVarga never returned to living in his native Hungary. Because he was very close to Mátyás Rákosi, he was several times invited as an economic advisor to Hungary. In this period (1945-1950) he had specialized in economic planning, pricing and monetary reforms, i.e. reforms the Hungarian Communists now in power were carrying out. After the fall of Rákosi caused by the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the take-over by the Kádár team, Varga's advisory work was not appreciated anymore.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his rendition of \"Bayan Ko\", which became the anthem for the opposition to the Marcos regime during the 1986 People Power Revolution, and for his song \"Anak\", the best-selling Philippine music record of all time. He is heavily associated with Pinoy rock.\n\nHe is well known internationally, and within the Philippines and Asia-Pacific region, claiming fame as one of the best musician-songwriters of the Philippines.\n\nFreddie Aguilar's musical beginnings started when he was young. At the age of 14, he wrote songs about his family who are now knows as the Peralta Family from Bukidnon. It was said that these people were exceedingly handsome and beautiful people that stole the hearts of many. When he was 17-years-old, Aguilar played his first guitar. By the time he was 20-years-old, Freddie Aguilar performed on stage for the first time.\n\nFreddie Aguilar studied Electrical Engineering at De Guzman Institute of Technology but did not finish the degree program. Instead he pursued music, became a street musician, and then a folk club and bar musician.\n\nAt the age of 18, Aguilar parted ways with his family and quit college. After realizing and regretting his mistakes five years later, he composed the song \"Anak\".\n\nFreddie Aguilar's influences include British and American folk-rock stars like Cat Stevens and James Taylor. He is also heavily influenced by his Filipino heritage, nationalist feelings, and tries to constitute a musical exploration of the Filipino ethos.\n\nFreddie Aguilar's \"Anak\" not only broke the Philippine record charts in 1979, but it also hit the no. 1 spot in Japan and achieved considerable popularity in other countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and parts of Western Europe.\nThe song has become so famous that, by some counts, it has been recorded in as many as a hundred versions in 23 languages throughout the world. \"Billboard\" reported that the song was the number two world hit of the 1980s. As of 2006, it was unsurpassed as the highest-selling record of Philippine music history.\n\nEven before Aguilar's rendition of \"Bayan Ko,\" Aguilar created and performed songs targeted at social injustices. His album, \"Magdalena\" included songs about a girl forced into prostitution as a result of poverty and the Christian-Muslim clashes in his song \"Mindanao.\" After the album, Freddie Aguilar also sang about the injustices suffered by the powerless, poverty, and the arrogance of superpowers in a song about the U.S. and Russia.\n\nFive years after the composition of \"Anak\", Freddie Aguilar joined protests against the Marcos regime and began writing and performing songs that criticized the excesses of the government. Some of the songs that caused him to be banned from mainstream media include: \"Kata-rungan\" or \"Justice\" (speaking for the unjustly accused), \"Pangako\" (\"Promise\") (a leader's unfulfilled pledges to an abandoned people), and \"Luzvi-minda\" (an acronym for Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao, calling on Filipinos to wake up to the reality of oppression). One of the songs he was most remembered for during that time was his interpretation of \"Bayan Ko\" (\"My Country\"), in which he added a verse to the original piece.\n\nIn 1978, Aguilar first recorded \"Bayan Ko\" in a patriotic effort to, in his words, \"jolt back those who were starting to forget who we really are.\" He also provided a rendition of the song as it is inspiring and gave him excitement and a surge of power. The song was originally composed in 1928 by Constancio de Guzman, with lyrics by poet Jose Corazon de Jesus, during a time of struggle for Philippine independence from US occupation. It emerged once again during the Marcos regime as the unofficial anthem of the emergent \"people\" of \"People Power\", the new democratic nation opposed to authoritarianism that is widely credited with the deposing of Ferdinand Marcos. In 1983, the assassination of Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino triggered massive demonstrations against the Marcos dictatorship, and Aguilar's rendition of \"Bayan Ko\" was blared on the radio and speakers mounted on jeepneys throughout the streets of Manila and the provinces of the Philippines. At the funeral of Senator Aquino, Freddie Aguilar sang \"Bayan Ko\" and felt that Aquino was a man of action who even gave his life for the freedom of the Philippines. During the performance, Freddie Aguilar did not feel scared anymore and felt strong and confident. He then decided to join the cause as well. Aguilar, along with APO Hiking Society and other Pinoy pop musicians who took a stand against dictatorship, joined other protest singers in music and street performances as part of the anti-Marcos rallies.\n\nA few years later, Aguilar campaigned for the presidential candidacy of Corazon Aquino in the national election that would lead to the 1986 revolt.\n\nAguilar mentioned in an interview with ABS-CBN News that the lyrics of the song combines the love the Filipinos have for their country, commemorate the Aquino family, and commitment to the country. Even in this modern time, Filipinos will identify \"Bayan Ko\" as the nation's protest anthem.\n\nOn January 18, 2008, Aguilar received the Asia Star Award from the Asia Model Award Festival in Korea.\n\nAguilar still lives in the Philippines, and continues to perform. He currently has moved to his own place dubbed \"Ka Freddie's\". He still has a strong following in the Philippines and among many Filipinos living overseas.\n\nOn July 14, 2016, Aguilar has been appointed as one of the 15 commissioners of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA). Aguilar has been advocating for the creation of a new department called \"Department of Culture and Arts\". During the campaign and the Inauguration of president Rodrigo Duterte, Aguilar performed “Para sa Tunay na Pagbabago”, which is one of Duterte's campaign jingles to the tune of Ipaglalaban Ko. Aguilar is President Duterte's favorite singer.\nIn 1978, he married Josephine Queipo and with her had 4 children: Maegan, Jonan, Isabella, and Jeriko.\n\nOn October 17, 2013, Aguilar openly admitted, in spite of the controversy that followed, that he is in a relationship with a 16-year-old girl, with plans to marry and even have children, as his partner insisted that she is willing to have a baby.\n\nOn November 22, 2013, Aguilar, under Islamic rites, married his partner in Buluan, Maguindanao. Aguilar had converted to Islam six months prior to these reports, so that he could marry his then 16-year-old girlfriend. His Muslim name is Abdul Farid.\n\nOn January 3, 2018, Aguilar's residence in North Fairview, Quezon City was destroyed by a fire, which was reported to have started at his music room. The fire destroyed most of Aguilar's valuables estimated at around , including his art collection, awards, musical instruments, records, and other personal memorabilia. Aguilar was at a bar along Tomas Morato Avenue during the fire. His wife, son Jonan, and mother-in-law were all inside his residence during the fire, but were able to escape unharmed with the help of their neighbors.\n\nIn chronological order [date or year of release]:\n\n\n"}

He was a prosecutor in the trial that followed the Abraham Lincoln assassination. He was appointed to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers in 1866, to rank from March 13, 1865.\n\nBurnett was born in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1838. He was the son of Henry Burnett (1801–1876), an abolitionist, and Nancy (née Jones) Burnett (d. 1880). His paternal grandfather, Samuel Burnett, a native of Morristown, New Jersey was, at one time, prominent and influential. He as educated had a considerable fortune, but lost most of his property during the Revolutionary War, along with Robert Morris, and emigrated west to Ohio around 1798. He was also a descendant of William Burnett, a colonial governor of New York and New Jersey.\n\nHe was determined not to become a farmer, he ran away from home to get an education. He attended Chester Academy and, later, Hiram College where he was taught by later President James A. Garfield.\n\nIn 1855, he began his studies at Ohio State National Law School, in Poland, Ohio, graduating in 1859. Following his graduation, he begins reading law with Judge Benjamin F. Hoffman, law partner of David Tod, who later served as Governor of Ohio. He was admitted to the bar in 1860, and began practicing in Warren, Ohio.\n\nIn 1861 when the Civil War broke out, Burnett joined the 2nd Ohio Cavalry, where he rose to the rank of major in 1862. After being trampled by a horse and seriously injured in 1863, however, he transferred to the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Department of the Ohio, working for Joseph Holt, the Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army.\n\nIn 1865, he was appointed brevet Colonel in the Judge Advocate Corps.\n\nAfter the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, Burnett was called upon by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to be an Assistant Judge Advocate General. Along with him were John Bingham and Joseph Holt, the Judge Advocate General. The accused conspirators where George Atzerodt, David Herold, Lewis Powell, Samuel Arnold, Michael O'Laughlen, Edman Spangler, Samuel Mudd and Mary Surratt.\n\nThe trail began on May 10, 1865. The three spent nearly two months in court, awaiting a verdict from the jury. Holt and Bingham attempted to obscure the fact that there were two plots. The first plot was to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the Confederate prisoners the Union had. The second was to assassinate Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward to throw the government into chaos.\n\nIt was important for the prosecution not to reveal the existence of a diary taken from the body of Lincoln's assassin John Wilkes Booth. The diary made it clear that the assassination plan dated from 14 April. The defence surprisingly did not call for Booth's diary to be produced in court. Holt was accused of withholding evidence, but it was never proven.\n\nOn June 29, the eight were found guilty for their involvement in the conspiracy to kill Lincoln. Arnold, O'Laughlen and Mudd were sentenced to life in prison, Spangler six years in prison and Atzerodt, Herold, Paine and Surratt were to hang. They were executed July 7, 1865. Surratt was the first woman in American history to be executed. O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Arnold, Spangler, and Mudd were pardoned by Andrew Johnson in early 1869.\n\nFollowing the completion of the trial, in October 1865, Burnett asked to be mustered out on December 1, 1865, which was granted. Senator John Sherman and Holt asked for him to be appointed a brevet brigadier general, which he accepted in May 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Burnett for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.\n\nIn late 1865, he moved to New York City where he resumed the practice of law with Judge Thomas W. Bartley, former Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court and Governor of Ohio, until 1869. Following his practice in New York, Burnett and his second wife moved back to Ohio where he then practiced law with Jacob Dolson Cox, another former Governor, and John F. Follett, who later served as a U.S. Representative, until 1872, when he started a practice in New York with Edwin W. Stoughton.\n\nBurnett again moved to New York, this time in Buffalo, where he served as counsel to the Buffalo and Erie Railroad (where his father-in-law was treasurer), until 1874. After the railroad, he formed several law practices in New York with various prominent men, including \"Emott, Burnett & Hammond\" (with former Judge James Emott, Henry B. Hammond, and Charles C. Emott in 1875), which litigated for and against the Railways, \"Emott, Burnett & Kidder\" (with Camillus George Kidder in 1877), \"Bristow, Peet, Burnett, & Opdyke\" (with Benjamin Bristow, a former Secretary of the Treasury, William Peet, and W. S. Opdyke in 1878), and \"Burnett & Whitney\" (with Edward Baldwin Whitney in 1883). He was notable involved in representing the English bondholders in the Emma Silver Mine litigation.\n\nIn 1898, President William McKinley, his close friend, appointed Burnett federal district attorney for the southern district of New York. Upon completion of his four-year term, he was reappointed by McKinley's successor, Theodore Roosevelt, for another four-year term in 1901, which he served in until his retirement in 1906.\n\nOn October 27, 1858, Burnett married Grace \"Kitty\" Hoffman (1842–1864), the daughter of Benjamin F. Hoffman, a judge. Together, they were the parents of:\n\n\nAfter his first wife's death in 1864, he married Sarah Gibson Lansing (1846–1877), the daughter of Brig. Gen. Henry Livingston Lansing (1818–1889), treasurer of the Buffalo and Erie Railroad, and Catharine Olivia (née Gibson) Lansing (1818–1897), on September 4, 1867. Her paternal grandfather was Barent Bleecker Lansing and her maternal grandparents were Henry Bicker Gibson (1783-1863), banker and president of the Rochester and Syracuse Railroad, and one of the richest men in Western New York, and Sarah (née Sherman) Gibson (herself the aunt of William Watts Sherman). Before her death in 1877, they were the parents of:\n\n\nAfter his second wife's death and burial at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo in 1877, he married for the third and final time to Agnes Suffern Tailer (1858–1932) on January 31, 1882 at the Church of the Ascension at Fifth Avenue and 10th Street in Manhattan. She was the daughter of Edward Neufville Tailer, a prominent New York merchant and banker, and the granddaughter of Thomas Suffern and Edward Neufville Tailer, Sr. (descendants of William Tailer, colonial governor of Massachusetts). The guests at their wedding included Mr. and Mrs. William H. Vanderbilt, William and Alva Vanderbilt, Cornelius and Alice Claypoole Vanderbilt, William Seward and Eliza Vanderbilt Webb, Gen. James Watson Webb, Ogden and Mary Wilson Goelet, Col. and Mrs. Delancey Kane, and others.

Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.\n\nHe was a member of the Metropolitan Club, the Century Association, Union Club, the Colonial Club, and the Goshen Driving Club. He also served as past president of the Ohio Society of New York, for four years, and the Loyal Legion.\n\nSeeking a country home away from the city, Burnett and his wife purchased a horse-breeding farm in Goshen, New York, known as \"Hillside Farm,\" where he raced his stock on the amateur circuit. The 193-acre estate was sold in 1917.\n\n\n\n"}

Serving as a high-ranking official at the Winter Palace during the Russian Revolution of 1917, Ratiev is best known for saving the imperial treasures from being looted during the revolutionary turmoil. Ratiev spent several years in the Gulag but had his sentence commuted, at which point he retired to Tbilisi, Georgia where he remained until his death.\n\nIvan Ratiev was born in Oryol of a branch of the Georgian princely house of Ratishvili, which had emigrated to the Russian Empire in 1724. His father was an officer in the Russian army. Ivan Ratiev graduated from the Oryol Cadet Corps and then from the Nikolayevsky Cavalry College. In 1890 he joined the 44th Nizhegorod Dragoon Regiment, deployed in Georgia. There he married, in 1896, Ekaterina Irakliyevna, the Serene Princess Gruzinskaya (February 13, 1872 – 1917), a great-granddaughter of King Heraclius II of Georgia and a lady-in-waiting of the empress consort Alexandra Feodorovna.\n\nRatiev retired from army service due to a trauma sustained in a horse race at Tbilisi in 1907. He then studied at Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris and, after his return to Russia, worked for the Ministry of the Imperial Court. He was assigned to an army cavalry unit of the Winter Palace with the rank of rittmeister. By the imperial order of December 6, 1913, he was made a lieutenant-colonel (podpolkovnik) of the Imperial Guard cavalry and an acting Police Master of the Winter Palace. Promoted to the rank of colonel in 1916, Prince Ratiev was appointed as a deputy commandant of the Winter Palace in April 1917, two months after the February Revolution overthrew the tsar Nicholas II. \n\nDuring the storm of the Winter Palace by the Bolshevik revolutionaries on October 25, 1917, Ratiev did not flee, but ordered his guardsmen to evacuate the former imperial treasures to safer areas of the Palace. He dispatched his 16-year son Dimitri and two most trusted grenadiers to guard the secret depository, which, among other precious objects, housed the tsar's scepter incorporating the Orlov diamond. He then negotiated with the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, who oversaw the storm of the Palace, thereby saving the treasures of the Palace from being looted and destroyed. The Soviet leadership publicly expressed their gratitude to Prince Ratiev on the pages of \"Izvestia\" (November 5, 1917) for \"self-sacrificing efforts to protect and preserve the people's treasures\" and appointed him the chief commandant of the Winter Palace and of all state museums and palaces of the Petrograd district.\n\nIn March 1919, Ratiev escorted the \"golden echelon\", a train carrying Russia's gold reserve, upon the transfer of the Russian government from Petrograd to Moscow. The road to Moscow was uneasy, Ratiev being pressured into surrendering the train and even being fired upon at Tver. Ratiev retired from the state service shortly thereafter and worked \nas a translator for various organizations of Moscow for several years. His subsequent life was marred by the loss of his wife and a son, who drowned while swimming in the river. \n\nIn March 1924, Ivan Ratiev, his daughter Olga, and sister Sophia were arrested on charges of being members of \"a counterrevolutionary monarchist organization.\" Due to his service in 1917, Ivan Ratiev's sentence of 5 years in Gulag was commuted to exile to Ekaterinburg, where the family spent 3 years. In 1931, Ratiev moved to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, where he lived as a \"state pensioner\" and died at the age of 90.\n\nRatiev's daughter, Olga (died 1987), was married to the Russian Rurikid prince Yuri Sergeyevich Lvov (1897–1937), a grandnephew of Prince Georgy Lvov, the Russian Prime Minister in 1917. Their daughter, Ekaterina, married the noted Georgian physicist Professor Vladimir Roinishvili.\n"}

He was the last Independent to serve as Governor of Rhode Island until Lincoln Chafee (2011–2015).\n\nBorn in Newport in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, he was the son of Samuel and Elizabeth Collins. He stood forth as a staunch advocate of the independence of the Thirteen Colonies. An admirer of George Washington, he was selected by the governor of Rhode Island in 1776 to carry a letter to Washington informing him of the condition of the colony and soliciting counsel upon the best method to adopt for its defense. Later (1782) he was made bearer to the President of Congress of a statement of Rhode Island's reasons for rejecting the Impost Act. During the American Revolution, Rhode Island was for the most part an agricultural area and as such opposed the restrictions of a national government.\n\nIn 1778, Collins represented Rhode Island in the Second Continental Congress, where he served until May 1781, when he was superseded by William Ellery. He was, however, re-elected in 1782 and held the position until 1783.\n\nWithin the state the agricultural interests vigorously advocated a paper currency. Collins espoused their cause and in 1786 was elected governor. During his term in office the issuance of paper money, which had been ceased at intervals since 1750, was resumed. It was provided by law that should any creditor refuse to accept the bills of the state the debtor might secure a discharge by depositing the amount of his debt with one of the judges of the state superior court or the court of common pleas. This law led to the suit of \"Trevett vs. Weeden\", which resulted in a decision looking toward the right of courts to declare legislative enactments unconstitutional.\n\nIn 1786 Collins was elected governor of Rhode Island and took office on May 3, 1786.\n\nWhen George Washington was inaugurated as President on April 30, 1789 Rhode Island was one of only two of the thirteen original states (along with North Carolina) not to have ratified the United States Constitution and was, technically speaking, an independent nation with Collins as it chief of state.\n\nAnti-Federalist elements in Rhode Island, up to 1790, vigorously fought against the calling of a convention to decide upon entering the Federal Union, but in that year (January 17) gave its sanction to such a call by a majority of one vote in the General Assembly. This vote was cast by Collins, who had come to realize the importance of a Federal connection. The vote cost him his popularity and the governorship. He left office on May 5, 1790. The Rhode Island General Assembly ratified the United States Constitution on May 29.\n\nLater in 1790 Collins was elected to the 1st Congress but did not take his seat.\n\nCollins was married to Mary, daughter of John Avery of Boston, and his daughter Abigail married John Warren. Collins died at Newport and was buried on his farm, \"Brenton Neck\", near Brenton Point in that city.\n\nHis grandson and namesake, John Collins Covell (1823–1887), was a principal of the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind and West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind.\n\nThe Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the Revolution holds an annual observance of Rhode Island Independence Day (May 4) at Governor Collins' grave.\n\n"}

Kuchma took office after winning the 1994 presidential election against his rival, the incumbent Leonid Kravchuk. Kuchma won re-election for an additional five-year term in 1999.\n\nHis presidency was surrounded by numerous corruption scandals and the lessening of media freedoms. Corruption accelerated after Kuchma's election in 1994, but in 2000–2001, his power began to weaken in the face of exposures in the media.\n\nOn his watch the Ukrainian economy continued to decline until 1999, whereas growth was recorded since 2000, bringing relative prosperity to some segments of urban residents. During his presidency, Ukrainian-Russian ties began to improve.\n\nAfter a successful career in the machine-building industry of the Soviet Union, Kuchma began his political career in 1990, when he was elected to the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament); he was re-elected in 1994. He served as Ukrainian Prime Minister between October 1992 and September 1993.\n\nFrom July 2014 until October 2018 Kuchma was a special presidential representative of Ukraine at the semi-official peace talks regarding the ongoing War in Donbass.\n\nLeonid Kuchma was born in the village of Chaikine in rural Chernihiv Oblast. His father Danylo Prokopovych Kuchma (1901–1942) was wounded in World War II and eventually died of his wounds in the field hospital #756 (near the village of Novoselytsia) when Leonid was four. His mother Paraska Trokhymivna Kuchma worked at a kolhoz. Kuchma attended the Kostobobrove general education school in the neighboring Semenivka Raion. Later he enrolled in Dnipropetrovsk National University and graduated in 1960 with a degree in mechanical engineering (majoring in aerospace engineering). The same year he joined the Communist Party of Soviet Union. Kuchma is a candidate of technical sciences.\n\nIn 1967 Kuchma married Lyudmyla.\n\nAfter graduation, Kuchma worked in the field of aerospace engineering for the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau in Dnipropetrovsk. At 28 he became a testing director for the Bureau deployed at the Baikonur cosmodrome.\n\nSome political observers suggested that Kuchma's early career was significantly boosted by his marriage to , an adopted daughter of Gennadiy Tumanov, the Yuzhmash chief engineering officer and later the Soviet Minister of Medium Machine Building.\n\nAt 38 Kuchma became the Communist party chief at Yuzhny Machine-building Plant and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. He was a delegate of the 27th and 28th Congresses of the Communist Party of Soviet Union. By the end of the 1980s, Kuchma openly criticized the Communist Party.\n\nIn 1982 Kuchma was appointed the first deputy of general design engineer at Yuzhmash, and from 1986 to 1992, he held the position of the company's general director. From 1990 to 1992, Kuchma was a member of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament). In 1992 he was appointed as Prime Minister of Ukraine. He resigned a year later, complaining of \"slow pace of reform\". He was re-elected into parliament in 1994.\n\nKuchma resigned from the position of Prime Minister of Ukraine in September 1993 to run for the presidency in 1994 on a platform to boost the economy by restoring economic relations with Russia and faster pro-market reforms. Kuchma won a clear victory against the incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk, receiving strong support from the industrial areas in the east and south. His worst results were in the west of the country.\n\nKuchma was re-elected in 1999 to his second term. This time the areas that gave him strongest support last time voted for his opponents, and the areas which voted against him last time came to his support.\n\nDuring Kuchma's Presidency, he closed opposition papers and several journalists died in mysterious circumstances. According to historian Serhy Yekelchyk President Kuchma's administration \"employed electoral fraud freely\" during the 2000 constitutional referendum and 1999 presidential elections.\nIn October 1994, Kuchma announced comprehensive economic reforms, including reduced subsidies, lifting of price controls, lower taxes, privatization of industry and agriculture, and reforms in currency regulation and banking. The parliament approved the plan's main points. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) promised a $360 million loan to initiate reforms.\n\nHe was re-elected in 1999 to his second term. Opponents accused him of involvement in the killing in 2000 of journalist Georgiy Gongadze (see also SBU, \"Cassette Scandal\", Mykola Mel'nychenko), which he has always denied. Critics also blamed Kuchma for restrictions on press freedom. Kuchma is believed to have played a key role in sacking the Cabinet of Viktor Yushchenko by Verkhovna Rada on 26 April 2001.\n\nKuchma's Prime Minister from 2002 until early January 2005 was Viktor Yanukovych, after Kuchma dismissed Anatoliy Kinakh, his previous appointee.\n\nIn 2002 Kuchma stated that Ukraine wanted to sign an association agreement with the European Union (EU) by 2003–2004 and that Ukraine would meet all EU membership requirements by 2007–2011. He also hoped for a free-trade treaty with the EU.\n\nIn his inaugural address Kuchma said:\n\nKuchma signed a \"Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership\" with Russia, and endorsed a round of talks with the CIS. Additionally, he referred to Russian as \"an official language\". He signed a special partnership agreement with NATO and raised the possibility of membership of the alliance.\n\nAfter Kuchma's popularity at home and abroad sank as he became mired in corruption scandals, he turned to Russia as his new ally. He said that Ukraine needed a \"multivector\" foreign policy that balanced eastern and western interests.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2000, Kuchma's bodyguard Mykola Melnychenko was allegedly eavesdropping Kuchma's office, later publishing the recordings. The release of the tapes – dubbed \"Kuchmagate\" by the Ukrainian press – supposedly revealed Kuchma's numerous crimes. In particular, his approving the sale of radar systems to Saddam Hussein (among other illegal arms sales) and ordering the Ukraine's police minister to \"take care\" of the journalist Georgiy Gongadze.\n\nIn September 2000, Gongadze disappeared and his headless corpse was found mutilated on 3 November 2000. On 28 November, the opposition politician Oleksandr Moroz publicised the tape recordings implicating Kuchma in Gongadze's murder. In 2005 the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office instigated criminal proceedings against Kuchma and members of his former administration in connection with the murder of Gongadze. In 2005 the press reported that Kuchma had been unofficially granted immunity from prosecution in return for his graceful departure from office in 2005.\n\nCritics of the tape point to the difficulty of Melnychenko recording 500 hours of dictaphone tape unaided and undetected, the lack of material evidence of said recording equipment, and other doubts which question the authenticity and motive of the release of the tape. Kuchma acknowledged in 2003 that his voice was one of those on the tapes, but claimed the tapes had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.\n\nThe General Prosecutor of Ukraine's Office canceled its resolution to deny opening of criminal cases against Kuchma and other politicians within the Gongadze-case on 9 October 2010. On 22 March 2011, Ukraine opened an official investigation into the murder of Gongadze and, two days later, Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kuchma with involvement in the murder. A Ukrainian district court ordered prosecutors to drop criminal charges against Kuchma on 14 December 2011 on grounds that evidence linking him to the murder of Gongadze was insufficient. The court rejected Melnychenko's recordings as evidence. Gongadze's widow Myroslava Gongadze lodged an appeal against the ruling one week later.\n\nDuring the trial of Oleksiy Pukach, he claimed that Kuchma and (Kuchma's head of his Presidential Administration, Volodymyr Lytvyn) were the ones who ordered the murder of Gongadze. Pukach was convicted and sentenced to life for his part in the murder of Gongadze.\n\nFirst Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin claimed 20 February 2013 that his office had collected enough evidence confirming Kuchma's responsibility for ordering Gongadze's assassination. Kuchma's reply the next day was, \"This is another banal example of a provocation, which I've heard more than enough in the past 12 years\".\n\nKuchma's role in the election crisis of 2004 is not entirely clear. After the second round on 22 November 2004, it appeared that Yanukovych had won the election by fraud, which caused the opposition and independent observers to dispute the results, leading to the Orange Revolution.\n\nKuchma was urged by Yanukovych and Viktor Medvedchuk (the head of the presidential office) to declare a state of emergency and hold the inauguration of Yanukovych. He denied the request. Later, Yanukovych publicly accused Kuchma of a betrayal. Kuchma refused to officially dismiss Prime Minister Yanukovych after the parliament passed a motion of no confidence against the Cabinet on 1 December 2004. Soon after, Kuchma left the country. He returned to Ukraine in March 2005.\n\nKuchma said in October 2009 he would vote for Victor Yanukovych at the Ukrainian presidential election, 2010. In a document dated 2 February 2010 uncovered during the United States diplomatic cables leak, Kuchma in conversation with United States Ambassador to Ukraine John F. Tefft, called the voters' choice between Yanukovych and Yulia Tymoshenko during the second round of the 2010 presidential election as a choice between \"bad and very bad\" and praised (the candidate eliminated in the first round of the election) Arseniy Yatsenyuk instead.\n\nIn September 2011 Kuchma stated that he believed that Yanukovych was the real winner of the 2004 election.\n\nLeonid Kuchma has been active in politics since his presidency ended. He aligned himself with President Viktor Yushchenko in 2005, but later raised concerns about the president in correspondence with then U.S. Ambassador to the Ukraine, John Tefft. Kuchma endorsed Yanukovych for president in 2010.\n\nKuchma represented Ukraine at negotiations with the armed separatist in the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces on 21 June 2014 to discuss President Petro Poroshenko peace plan. His role as a diplomat has been received positively by the west and Russia as well as the public in Ukraine.\n\nOn 11, February 2015, Kuchma was one of the signatories of a draft plan to end the conflict in Donbas. The summit was known as Minsk II. The plan ensured that a ceasefire was implemented and reaction from leaders in Europe was generally positive.\n\nIn March 2015, Kuchma delivered an address and called on the west for greater involvement in the region. He criticized the action of Russian backed forces in the attempt to seize the town of Debaltseve.\n\nKuchma decommissioned the Chernobyl power plant's reactor.\n\nIn September, 2015 Kuchma was again appointed as the representative for Ukraine at the Trilateral Contact Group. The group met in Belarus to discuss ending the conflict in Donbas. The choice of Kuchma comes nearly a decade after his presidency ended.\n\nIn early 2017, Kuchma spoke out against the transport blockade of Donbass. In March 2017 at the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) in Minsk, he demanded the Russian Federation repeal their decree on the recognition of passports issued in separatist-held areas.\n\nOn 2 October 2018 Kuchma stepped down as Ukraine’s representative in the Trilateral Contact Group due to his age.\n\n\n\n\nLeonid Kuchma is married to Lyudmyla Kuchma since 1967. She is the Honorary President of the National Fund of Social Protection of Mothers and Children, \"Ukraine to Children\" and is also known as a paralympic movement in Ukraine supporter.\n\nKuchma's only child, daughter Olena Pinchuk, is married to Viktor Pinchuk, a Jewish industrialist and philanthropist whose Victor Pinchuk Foundation regularly hosts Ukraine-dedicated and philanthropic fora at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. Olena Pinchuk has a son Roman (born in 1991, from her previous marriage with Ukrainian businessman Igor Franchuk) who attends Brown University, and two daughters with Viktor Pinchuk, Katerina (born in 2003) and Veronica (2011). Olena Pinchuk founded the ANTIAIDS Foundation in 2003. According to the Ukrainian magazine \"Focus,\" Olena Pinchuk was amongst the \"top 10 most influential women\" in Ukraine as of 2010.\n\nVictor Pinchuk recently made headlines when it was revealed that one of his lobbyists was previously picked by Donald Trump for national security aide. It was also revealed that his Foundation made significant contributions to both Trump and Clinton campaigns.\n\nKuchma was an amateur guitar player in his younger years. He was also known for his skill at the complicated card game \"preferans.\"\n\nIn 2003, he published his book \"Ukraine is not Russia\" ().\n\nAfter retirement, Kuchma was allowed to keep the state-owned dacha in Koncha-Zaspa for his personal use upon completion of his state duties. The government order #15-r that would allow for Kuchma to keep his estate was signed by the acting prime-minister Mykola Azarov on 19 January 2005. Kuchma was also allowed to keep his full presidential salary and all the service personnel, along with two state-owned vehicles. That order also stated that these costs would be paid out of the state budget.\n\nKuchma was awarded the Azerbaijani Istiglal Order for his contributions to Azerbaijan-Ukraine relations and strategic cooperation between the states by President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev on 6 August 1999.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13097343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13097343", "title": "Military career of George Washington", "text": "Military career of George Washington\n\nThe military career of George Washington spanned over forty years of service. Washington's service can be broken into three periods (French and Indian War, American Revolutionary War, and the Quasi-War with France) with service in three different armed forces (British provincial militia, the Continental Army, and the United States Army).\n\nBecause of Washington's importance in the early history of the United States of America, he was granted a posthumous promotion to General of the Armies of the United States, legislatively defined to be the highest possible rank in the US Army, more than 175 years after his death.\n\nVirginia's Royal Governor, Robert Dinwiddie, appointed Washington a major in the provincial militia in February 1753. In that year the French began expanding their military control into the \"Ohio Country\", a territory also claimed by the British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania. These competing claims led to a world war 1756–63 (called the French and Indian War in the colonies and the Seven Years' War in Europe) and Washington was at the center of its beginning. The Ohio Company was one vehicle through which British investors planned to expand into the territory, opening new settlements and building trading posts for the Indian trade. Governor Dinwiddie received orders from the British government to warn the French of British claims, and sent Major Washington in late 1753 to deliver a letter informing the French of those claims and asking them to leave. Washington also met with Tanacharison (also called \"Half-King\") and other Iroquois leaders allied to Virginia at Logstown to secure their support in case of conflict with the French; Washington and Half-King became friends and allies. Washington delivered the letter to the local French commander, who politely refused to leave.\n\nGovernor Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the Ohio Country to protect an Ohio Company group building a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out the company's crew and began construction of Fort Duquesne. With Mingo allies led by Tanacharison, Washington and some of his militia unit ambushed a French scouting party of some 30 men, led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville; Jumonville was killed, and there are contradictory accounts of his death. The French responded by attacking and capturing Washington at Fort Necessity in July 1754. He was allowed to return with his troops to Virginia. The experience demonstrated Washington's bravery, initiative, inexperience and impetuosity. These events had international consequences; the French accused Washington of assassinating Jumonville, who they claimed was on a diplomatic mission similar to Washington's 1753 mission. Both France and Britain responded by sending troops to North America in 1755, although war was not formally declared until 1756.\n\nIn 1755, Washington was the senior Colonial aide to British General Edward Braddock on the ill-fated Braddock Expedition. This was at the time the largest ever British military expedition ventured into the colonies, and was intended to expel the French from the Ohio Country. The French and their Indian allies were able to ambush the expedition, mowing down over 900 casualties including the mortally-wounded Braddock. During what became known as the Battle of the Monongahela, British troops retreated in disarray but Washington rode back and forth across the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces to an organized retreat.\n\nGovernor Dinwiddie rewarded Washington in 1755 with a commission as \"Colonel of the Virginia Regiment and Commander in Chief of all forces now raised in the defense of His Majesty's Colony\" and gave him the task of defending Virginia's frontier. The Virginia Regiment was the first full-time American military unit in the colonies (as opposed to part-time militias and the British regular units). Washington was ordered to \"act defensively or offensively\" as he thought best. In command of a thousand soldiers, Washington was a disciplinarian who emphasized training. He led his men in brutal campaigns against the Indians in the west; in 10 months units of his regiment fought 20 battles, and lost a third of its men. Washington's strenuous efforts meant that Virginia's frontier population suffered less than that of other colonies; Ellis concludes \"it was his only unqualified success\" in the war.\n\nIn 1758, Washington participated in the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a friendly fire episode in which his unit and another British unit thought the other was the French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. In the end there was no real fighting for the French abandoned the fort and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley. Upon his return to Virginia, Washington resigned his commission in December 1758, and did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.\n\nAlthough Washington never gained the commission in the British army he yearned for, in these years he gained valuable military, political, and leadership skills, and received significant public exposure in the colonies and abroad. He closely observed British military tactics, gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution. He demonstrated his toughness and courage in the most difficult situations, including disasters and retreats. He developed a command presence—given his size, strength, stamina, and bravery in battle, he appeared to soldiers to be a natural leader and they followed him without question. Washington learned to organize, train, and drill, and discipline his companies and regiments. From his observations, readings and conversations with professional officers, he learned the basics of battlefield tactics, as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics. He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars. On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of about 1,000 men, and came only in remote frontier conditions.\n\nWashington never gained the commission in the British army that he yearned for, but in these years he gained valuable military, political, and leadership skills, closely observing their tactics, gaining a keen insight into their strengths and weaknesses that proved invaluable during the Revolution. He learned the basics of battlefield tactics from his observations, readings, and conversations with professional officers, as well as a good understanding of problems of organization and logistics. He gained an understanding of overall strategy, especially in locating strategic geographical points.\n\nWashington demonstrated his resourcefulness and courage in the most difficult situations, including disasters and retreats. He developed a command presence, given his size, strength, stamina, and bravery in battle, which demonstrated to soldiers that he was a natural leader whom they could follow without question. Washington's fortitude in his early years was sometimes manifested in less constructive ways. Biographer John R. Alden contends that Washington offered \"fulsome and insincere flattery to British generals in vain attempts to win great favor\" and on occasion showed youthful arrogance, as well as jealousy and ingratitude in the midst of impatience.\n\nAs political tensions rose in the colonies, Washington in June 1774 chaired the meeting at which the \"Fairfax Resolves\" were adopted, which called for, among other things, the convening of a Continental Congress. In August, Washington attended the First Virginia Convention, where he was selected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress. As tensions rose further in 1774, he assisted in the training of county militias in Virginia and organized enforcement of the boycott of British goods instituted by the Congress.\n\nAfter the Battles of Lexington and Concord near Boston in April 1775, the colonies went to war. Washington appeared at the Second Continental Congress in a military uniform, signaling that he was prepared for war. Congress created the Continental Army on June 14, 1775. Nominated by John Adams of Massachusetts, who chose him in part because he was a Virginian and would thus draw the southern colonies into the conflict, Washington was then appointed General and Commander-in-chief.\nWashington assumed command of the colonial forces outside Boston on July 3, 1775 (coincidentally making July 4 his first full-day as Commander-in-chief), during the ongoing siege of Boston. His first steps were to establish procedures and to weld what had begun as militia regiments into an effective fighting force.\n\nWhen inventory returns exposed a dangerous shortage of gunpowder, Washington asked for new sources. British arsenals were raided (including some in the West Indies) and some manufacturing was attempted; a barely adequate supply (about 2.5 million pounds) was obtained by the end of 1776, mostly from France. In search of heavy weapons, he sent Henry Knox on an expedition to Fort Ticonderoga to retrieve cannons that had been captured there. He resisted repeated calls from Congress to launch attacks against the British in Boston, calling war councils that supported the decisions against such action. Before the Continental Navy was established in November 1775 he, without Congressional authorization, began arming a \"secret navy\" to prey on poorly protected British transports and supply ships. When Congress authorized an invasion of Quebec, Washington authorized Benedict Arnold to lead a force from Cambridge to Quebec City through the wilderness of present-day Maine.\n\nAs the siege dragged on, the matter of expiring enlistments became a matter of serious concern. Washington tried to convince Congress that enlistments longer than one year were necessary to build an effective fighting force, but he was rebuffed in this effort. The 1776 establishment of the Continental Army only had enlistment terms of one year, a matter that would again be a problem in late 1776.\n\nWashington finally forced the British to withdraw from Boston by putting Henry Knox's artillery on Dorchester Heights overlooking the city, and preparing in detail to attack the city from Cambridge if the British tried to assault the position. The British evacuated Boston and sailed away, although Washington did not know they were headed for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Believing they were headed for New York City (which was indeed Major General William Howe's eventual destination), Washington rushed most of the army there.\n\nWashington's success in Boston was not repeated in New York. Recognizing the city's importance as a naval base and gateway to the Hudson River, he delegated the task of fortifying New York to Charles Lee in February 1776. Despite the city's poor defensibility, Congress insisted that Washington defend it. The faltering military campaign in Quebec also led to calls for additional troops there, and Washington detached six regiments northward under John Sullivan in April.\n\nWashington had to deal with his first major command controversy while in New York, which was partially a product of regional friction. New England troops serving in northern New York under General Philip Schuyler, a scion of an old patroon family of New York, objected to his aristocratic style, and their Congressional representatives lobbied Washington to replace Schuyler with Horatio Gates. Washington tried to quash the issue by giving Gates command of the forces in Quebec, but the collapse of the Quebec expedition brought renewed complaints. Despite Gates' experience, Washington personally preferred Schuyler, and put Gates in a role subordinate to Schuyler. The episode exposed Washington to Gates' desire for advancement, possibly at his expense, and to the latter's influence in Congress.\n\nGeneral Howe's army, reinforced by thousands of additional troops from Europe and a fleet under the command of his brother, Admiral Richard Howe, began arriving off New York in early July, and made an unopposed landing on Staten Island. Without intelligence about Howe's intentions, Washington was forced to divide his still poorly trained forces, principally between Manhattan and Long Island.\nIn August, the British finally launched their campaign to capture New York City. They first landed on Long Island in force, and flanked Washington's forward positions in the Battle of Long Island. Howe refused to act on a significant tactical advantage that could have resulted in the capture of the remaining Continental troops on Long Island, but he chose instead to besiege their positions. In the face of a siege he seemed certain to lose, Washington then decided to withdraw. In what some historians call one of his greatest military feats, executed a nighttime withdrawal from Long Island across the East River to Manhattan to save those troops.\n\nThe Howe brothers then paused to consolidate their position, and the admiral engaged in a fruitless peace conference with Congressional representatives on September 11. Four days later the British landed on Manhattan, scattering inexperienced militia into a panicked retreat, and forcing Washington to retreat further. After Washington stopped the British advance up Manhattan at Harlem Heights on September 16, Howe again made a flanking maneuver, landing troops at Pell's Point in a bid to cut off Washington's avenue of retreat. To defend against this move, Washington withdrew most of his army to White Plains, where after a short battle on October 28 he retreated further north. This isolated the remaining Continental Army troops in upper Manhattan, so Howe returned to Manhattan and captured Fort Washington in mid November, taking almost 3,000 prisoners. Four days later, Fort Lee, across the Hudson River from Fort Washington, was also taken. Washington brought much of his army across the Hudson into New Jersey, but was immediately forced to retreat by the aggressive British advance. During the campaign a general lack of organization, shortages of supplies, fatigue, sickness, and above all, lack of confidence in the American leadership resulted in a melting away of untrained regulars and frightened militia. Washington grumbled, \"The honor of making a brave defense does not seem to be sufficient stimulus, when the success is very doubtful, and the falling into the Enemy's hands probable.\"\n\nAfter the loss of New York, Washington's army was in two pieces. One detachment remained north of New York to protect the Hudson River corridor, while Washington retreated across New Jersey into Pennsylvania, chased by General Charles, Earl Cornwallis. Spirits were low, popular support was wavering, and Congress had abandoned Philadelphia, fearing a British attack. Washington ordered General Gates to bring troops from Fort Ticonderoga, and also ordered General Lee's troops, which he had left north of New York City, to join him.\n\nDespite the loss of troops due to desertion and expiring enlistments, Washington was heartened by a rise in militia enlistments in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. These militia companies were active in circumscribing the furthest outposts of the British, limiting their ability to scout and forage. Although Washington did not coordinate this resistance, he took advantage of it to organize an attack on an outpost of Hessians in Trenton. On the night of December 25–26, 1776, Washington led his forces across the Delaware River and surprised the Hessian garrison, capturing 1,000 Hessians.\nThis action significantly boosted the army's morale, but it also brought Cornwallis out of New York. He reassembled an army of more than 6,000 men, and marched most of them against a position Washington had taken south of Trenton. Leaving a garrison of 1,200 at Princeton, Cornwallis then attacked Washington's position on January 2, 1777, and was three times repulsed before darkness set in. During the night Washington evacuated the position, masking his army's movements by instructing the camp guards to maintain the appearance of a much larger force. Washington then circled around Cornwallis's position with the intention of attacking the Princeton garrison.\n\nHugh Mercer, leading the American advance guard, encountered British soldiers from Princeton under the command of Charles Mawhood. The British troops engaged Mercer and in the ensuing battle, Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent reinforcements under General John Cadwalader, which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton, with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton. The British lost more than one quarter of their force in the battle, and American morale rose with the great victory.\n\nThese unexpected victories drove the British back to the New York City area, and gave a dramatic boost to Revolutionary morale. During the winter, Washington, based in winter quarters at Morristown, New Jersey, loosely coordinated a low-level militia war against British positions in New Jersey, combining the actions of New Jersey and Pennsylvania militia companies with careful use of Continental Army resources to harry and harass the British and German troops quartered in New Jersey.\n\nWashington's mixed performance in the 1776 campaigns had not led to significant criticism in Congress. Before fleeing Philadelphia for Baltimore in December, Congress granted Washington powers that have ever since been described as \"dictatorial\". The successes in New Jersey nearly deified Washington in the eyes of some Congressmen, and the body became much more deferential to him as a result. Washington's performance also received international notice: Frederick the Great, one of the greatest military minds, wrote that \"the achievements of Washington [at Trenton and Princeton] were the most brilliant of any recorded in the history of military achievements.\"\n\nIn May 1777, the British resumed military operations, with General Howe attempting without success to draw Washington from his defensive position in New Jersey's Watchung Mountains, while General John Burgoyne led an army south from Quebec toward Albany, New York. Following Burgoyne's capture of Fort Ticonderoga without resistance in early July, General Howe boarded a large part of his army on transports and sailed off, leaving Washington mystified as to his destination. Washington dispatched some of his troops north to assist in Albany's defense, and moved most of the rest his forces south of Philadelphia when it became clear that was Howe's target.\nCongress, at the urging of its diplomatic representatives in Europe, had also issued military commissions to a number of European soldiers of fortune in early 1777. Two of those recommended by Silas Deane, the Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Conway, would prove to be important in Washington's activities. Lafayette, just twenty years old, was at first told that Deane had exceeded his authority in offering him a major general's commission, but offered to volunteer in the army at his own expense. Washington and Lafayette took an instant liking to one another when they met, and Lafayette became one of Washington's most trusted generals and confidants. Conway, on the other hand, did not think highly of Washington's leadership, and proved to be a source of trouble in the 1777 campaign season and its aftermath.\n\nGeneral Howe landed his troops south of Philadelphia at the northern end of Chesapeake Bay, and turned Washington's flank at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777. After further maneuvers, Washington was forced to retreat away from the city, allowing British troops to march unopposed into Philadelphia on September 26. Washington's failure to defend the capital brought on a storm of criticism from Congress, which fled the city for York, and from other army officers. In part to silence his critics, Washington planned an elaborate assault on an exposed British base in Germantown. The October 4 Battle of Germantown failed in part due to the complexity of the assault, and the inexperience of the militia forces employed in it. Over 400 of Washington's troops were captured, including Colonel George Mathews and the entire 9th Virginia Regiment. It did not help that Adam Stephen, leading one of the branches of the attack, was drunk, and broke from the agreed-upon plan of attack. He was court martialed and cashiered from the army. Historian Robert Leckie observes that the battle was a near thing, and that a small number of changes might have resulted in a decisive victory for Washington.\nMeanwhile, Burgoyne, out of reach from help from Howe, was trapped and forced to surrender his entire army on October 17, ten days after the Battle of Bemis Heights. The victory made a hero of General Gates, who received the adulation of Congress. While this was taking place Washington presided from a distance over the loss of control of the Delaware River to the British, and marched his army to its winter quarters at Valley Forge in December. Washington chose Valley Forge, over recommendations that he camp either closer or further from Philadelphia, because it was close enough to monitor British army movements, and protected rich farmlands to the west from the enemy's foraging expeditions.\n\nWashington's army stayed at Valley Forge for the next six months. Over the winter, 2500-3000 out of 11,000 men died (estimates vary) from disease and exposure. The army's difficulties were exacerbated by a number of factors, including a quartermaster's department that had been badly mismanaged by one of Washington's political opponents, Thomas Mifflin, and the preference of farmers and merchants to sell their goods to the British, who paid in sterling silver currency instead of the nearly worthless Continental paper currency. Profiteers also sought to benefit at the army's expense, charging it 1,000 times what they charged civilians for the same goods. Congress authorized Washington to seize supplies needed for the army, but he was reluctant to use such authority, since it smacked of the tyranny the war was supposedly being fought over.\n\nDuring the winter he introduced a full-scale training program supervised by Baron von Steuben, a veteran of the Prussian general staff. Despite the hardships the army suffered, this program was a remarkable success, and Washington's army emerged in the spring of 1778 a much more disciplined force.\n\nWashington himself had to face discontent at his leadership from a variety of sources. His loss of Philadelphia prompted some members of Congress to discuss removing him from command. They were prodded along by Washington's detractors in the military, who included Generals Gates, Mifflin, and Conway. Gates in particular was viewed by Conway and Congressmen Benjamin Rush and Richard Henry Lee as a desirable replacement for Washington. Although there is no evidence of a formal conspiracy, the episode is known as the Conway Cabal because the scale of the discontent within the army was exposed by a critical letter from Conway to Gates, some of whose contents were relayed to Washington. Washington exposed the criticisms to Congress, and his supporters, within Congress and the army, rallied to support him. Gates eventually apologized for his role in the affair, and Conway resigned. Washington's position and authority were not seriously challenged again. Biographer Ron Chernow points out that Washington's handling of the episode demonstrated that he was \"a consummate political infighter\" who maintained his temper and dignity while his opponents schemed.\n\nThe victory at Saratoga (and to some extent Washington's near success at Germantown) were influential in convincing France to enter the war openly as an American ally. French entry into the war changed its dynamics, for the British were no longer sure of command of the seas and had to worry about an invasion of their home islands and other colonial territories across the globe. The British, now under the command of General Sir Henry Clinton, evacuated Philadelphia in 1778 and returned to New York City, with Washington attacking them along the way at the Battle of Monmouth; this was the last major battle in the north. Prior to the battle Washington gave command of the advance forces to Charles Lee, who had been exchanged earlier in the year. Lee, despite firm instructions from Washington, refused Lafayette's suggestion to launch an organized attack on the British rear, and then retreated when the British turned to face him. When Washington arrived at the head of the main army, he and Lee had an angry exchange of words, and Washington ordered Lee off the command. Washington, with his army's tactics and ability to execute improved by the training programs of the previous winter, was able to recover, and fought the British to a draw. Lee was court martialed and eventually dismissed from the army.\nThe war in the north was effectively stalemated for the next few years. The British successfully defended Newport, Rhode Island against a Franco-American invasion attempt that was frustrated by bad weather and difficulties in cooperation between the allies. British and Indian forces organized and supported by Sir Frederick Haldimand in Quebec began to raid frontier settlements in 1778, and Savannah, Georgia was captured late in the year. In response to the frontier activity Washington organised a major expedition against the Iroquois in the summer of 1779. In the Sullivan Expedition, a sizable force under Major General John Sullivan drove the Iroquois from their lands in northwestern New York in reprisal for the frontier raids.\nWashington's opponent in New York was also active. Clinton engaged in a number of amphibious raids against coastal communities from Connecticut to Chesapeake Bay, and probed at Washington's defenses in the Hudson River valley. Coming up the river in force, he captured the key outpost of Stony Point, but advanced no further. When Clinton weakened the garrison there to provide men for raiding expeditions, Washington organized a counterstrike. General Anthony Wayne led a force that, solely using the bayonet, recaptured Stony Point. The Americans chose not to hold the post, but the operation was a boost to American morale and a blow to British morale. American morale was dealt a blow later in the year, when the second major attempt at Franco-American cooperation, an attempt to retake Savannah, failed with heavy casualties.\n\nThe winter of 1779–80 was one of the coldest in recorded colonial history. New York Harbor froze over, and the winter camps of the Continental Army were deluged with snow, resulting in hardships exceeding those experienced at Valley Forge. The war was declining in popularity, and the inflationary issuance of paper currency by Congress and the states alike harmed the economy, and the ability to provision the army. The paper currency also hit the army's morale, since it was how the troops were paid.\nThe British in late 1779 embarked on a new strategy based on the assumption that most Southerners were Loyalists at heart. General Clinton withdrew the British garrison from Newport, and marshalled a force of more than 10,000 men that in the first half of 1780 successfully besieged Charleston, South Carolina. In June 1780 he captured over 5,000 Continental soldiers and militia in the single worst defeat of the war for the Americans. Washington had at the end of March pessimistically dispatched several regiments troops southward from his army, hoping they might have some effect in what he saw as a looming disaster.\n\nWashington's army suffered from numerous problems in 1780: it was undermanned, underfunded, and underequipped. Because of these shortcomings Washington resisted calls for major expeditions, preferring to remain focused on the principal British presence in New York. Knowledge of discontent within the ranks in New Jersey prompted the British in New York to make two attempts to reach the principal army base at Morristown. These attempts were defeated, with significant militia support, in battles at Connecticut Farms and Springfield.\n\nSeptember 1780 brought a new shock to Washington. British Major John André had been arrested outside New York, and papers he carried exposed a conspiracy between the British and General Benedict Arnold. Washington respected Arnold for his military skills, and had, after Arnold's severe injuries in the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777, given him the military command of Philadelphia. During his administration there, Arnold had made many political enemies, and in 1779 he began secret negotiations with General Clinton (mediated in part by André) that culminated in a plot to surrender West Point, a command Arnold requested and Washington gave him in July 1780. Arnold was alerted to André's arrest and fled to the British lines shortly before Washington's arrival at West Point for a meeting. In negotiations with Clinton, Washington offered to exchange André for Arnold, but Clinton refused. André was hanged as a spy, and Arnold became a brigadier general in the British Army. Washington organized an attempt to kidnap Arnold from New York City; it was frustrated when Arnold was sent on a raiding expedition to Virginia.\n\nWashington was successful in developing an espionage network, the kept track of the British and loyalist forces, well misleading the enemy into the strength of the American and French positions, and their intentions. British intelligence, by contrast, was poorly done. Many prominent loyalists had fled to London, where they convinced Lord Jermaine and other top officials that there was a large potential loyalist fighting force that would rise up and join the British as soon as they were in the vicinity. This was entirely false, but the British relied upon it heavily, especially in the southern campaigns of 1780-81, leading to their disasters. Washington deceived the British in New York City marching his entire army, the entire French Army, around the city all the way to Virginia, where they surprised Cornwallis and his army. The greatest failure of British intelligence was the misunderstanding between the senior command in London, and New York regarding the need to support Burgoyne's invasion of New York. British communication failures and lack of intelligence on what was happening led to the surrender of Burgoyne's entire army.\n\nWashington used systematic reconnaissance on enemy positions by scouts and sponsored Major Benjamin Tallmadge who set up the Culper spy ring. Washington distrusted double agents, and was fooled by Benedict Arnold's treachery. Washington paid close attention to espionage reports, and acted on them. He made sure his intelligence officers briefed one another; he did not insist on prior approval of their plans. His intelligence system became an essential arm in molding the Americans partisan style asymmetrical strategy. This laid the groundwork in the 1790s for Washington to formulate intelligence gathering as an important tool in presidential power.\n\nA British army under General Cornwallis, fighting its way through the Carolinas and Virginia, made its way to Yorktown to be evacuated by the British Navy. Washington coordinated an elaborate operation whereby both the French army in New England and the American Army in New York slipped off to Virginia without the British noticing. Cornwallis found himself surrounded, and a French naval victory against the British rescue fleet dashed his hopes. The surrender of Cornwallis to Washington on October 17, 1781 marked the end of serious fighting. In London, the war party lost control of parliament, and the British negotiated the Treaty of Paris (1783) That ended the war. Hoping to gain the United States as a major trading partner, the British offered surprisingly generous terms.\n\nWashington designed the American strategy for victory. It enabled Continental forces to maintain their strength for six years and to capture two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. Some historians have lauded Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals, preservation and command of the army, coordination with the Congress, with state governors and their militia, and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. On the day of battle, however, Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals. Washington was not a great battlefield tactician; he sometimes planned operations that were too complicated for his amateur officers to execute. However, his overall strategy proved to be successful: keep control of 90% of the population at all times (including suppression of the Loyalist civilian population); keep the army intact; avoid decisive battles; and look for an opportunity to capture an outnumbered enemy army. Washington was a military conservative: he preferred building a regular army on the European model and fighting a conventional war, and often complained about the undisciplined American militia.\n\nOne of Washington's most important contributions as commander-in-chief was to establish the precedent that civilian-elected officials, rather than military officers, possessed ultimate authority over the military. This was a key principle of Republicanism, but could easily have been violated by Washington. Throughout the war, he deferred to the authority of Congress and state officials, and he relinquished his considerable military power once the fighting was over. In March 1783, Washington used his influence to disperse a group of Army officers who had threatened to confront Congress regarding their back pay. Washington disbanded his army and announced his intent to resign from public life in his \"Farewell Orders to the Armies of the United States.\" A few days later, on November 25, 1783, the British evacuated New York City, and Washington and the governor took possession of the city; at Fraunces Tavern in the city on December 4, he formally bade his officers farewell. On December 23, 1783, Washington resigned his commission as commander-in-chief to the Congress of the Confederation at Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nIn the fall of 1798, Washington became immersed in the business of creating a military force to deal with the threat of an all-out war with France. President John Adams asked him to resume the post of commander-in-chief and to raise an army in the event war broke out. Washington agreed, stipulating that he would only serve in the field if it became absolutely necessary, and if he could choose his subordinates. Disputes arose over the relative rankings of his chosen command. Washington selected Alexander Hamilton as his inspector general and second in command, followed by Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Henry Knox. This hierarchy was an inversion of the ranks these men had held during the revolution. Adams wanted to reverse the order, giving Knox the most important role, but Washington was insistent, threatening to resign if his choices were not approved. He prevailed, but the episode noticeably cooled his relationship with Henry Knox, and impaired Adams' relations with his cabinet. The resolution of this affair brought no opportunity for rest: Washington engaged in the tedious task of finding officers for the new military formations. In the spring of 1799, the relaxation of tensions between France and the United States allowed Washington to redirect his attention to his personal affairs.\n\nGeorge Washington died on December 14, 1799, at the age of 67. Upon his passing he was listed as a retired lieutenant general on the rolls of the US Army. Over the next 177 years, various officers surpassed Washington in rank, including most notably John J. Pershing, who was promoted to General of the Armies for his role in World War I. With effect from 4 July 1976, Washington was posthumously promoted to the same rank by authority of a congressional joint resolution. The resolution stated that Washington's seniority had rank and precedence over all other grades of the Armed Forces, past or present, effectively making Washington the highest ranked U.S. officer of all time. \n\nHistorians debate whether Washington preferred to fight major battles or to utilize a Fabian strategy to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks followed by a retreat so that the larger British army could not catch him. His southern commander Greene did use Fabian tactics in 1780–81; Washington did so only in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By summer 1777 Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.\n\n\nThe following are summaries of battles where George Washington was the commanding officer.\n\n\n"}

He made his theatrical debut a year before graduating, at the Bulandra Theater, in Truman Capote's \"The Grass Harp\". His screen debut came in Dan Pița's \"Nunta de piatră\" (1972); he would later appear in the same director's \"Filip cel Bun\" (1975). Other directors with whom he has worked include Alexandru Tatos (\"Mere roșii\", 1975; \"Secvențe\", 1982; and \"Secretul armei secrete\", 1988), Virgil Calotescu (\"Buletin de București\", 1982; and \"Căsătorie cu repetiție\", 1985), Nae Caranfil (\"Asfalt Tango\", 1996; and \"Filantropica\", 2002) and Cătălin Mitulescu (\"The Way I Spent the End of the World\", 2006). In all, he has appeared in more than sixty films.\n\nDiaconu worked with Lucian Pintilie both in film (the 1981 \"De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?\") and in theater: Gogol's \"The Government Inspector\" at Bulandra, and Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" at the Nottara Theater. Liviu Ciulei hired him at Bulandra in 1972, and he remained there for a decade, before moving on to Nottara. At Bulandra, he appeared in \"Twelfth Night\" and \"The Tempest\", both under Ciulei's direction; and in Marin Sorescu's \"Răceala\", directed by Dan Micu. At Nottara, he appeared in Alexander Ostrovsky's \"The Forest\"; \"Ultimul bal\", after Liviu Rebreanu's \"Forest of the Hanged\"; and Mihai Ispirescu's \"Într-o dimineață\". He became the director of Nottara Theater in 2004, working as such until his resignation in 2011.\nA participant in the Romanian Revolution, he was rehearsing a play at Nottara when Nicolae Ceaușescu's final speech began on 21 December 1989. During the day, he and his colleagues organized students to go to area factories and urge workers to declare an immediate strike. He spent the night outdoors with students, believing that, although the uprising lacked familiar leaders who could be trusted, the crowd at least recognized popular actors' faces. During the night, Securitate secret police fired through apartment windows, while the next morning, Diaconu saw that agents had quietly killed people with brass knuckles. However, he soon noticed that a revolution was in full swing, the boulevards leading to the city center packed with advancing workers who had trapped two tanks, one of which he rode to the Central Committee building from which Ceaușescu had spoken the previous day. Later, he was among several figures to appear before a microphone in Palace Square. Addressing a throng chanting anti-Ceaușescu slogans, he repeated an appeal for calm.\n\nIn 1990 he became the country's first actor to resign his contract with a theater and become a freelancer. Other theaters with which he has appeared include Theatrum Mundi and the National Theatre Bucharest. He taught acting at his alma mater between 1977 and 1978, and again from 1991 to 1998. He wrote three books that appeared under the Communist regime. The first, \"Șugubina\" (1977), is a volume of short stories. The second, \"La noi, când vine iarna\", was initially published as a children's book in 1980 and was republished as a novel for adults in 2013. The third, \"Scaunul de pânză al actorului\" (1985), includes sketches about the theatrical world. He was obliged to join the Romanian Communist Party during his second year of university, due to the high grades he had achieved.\n\nHe began his political career in 2008, when he was elected to the Senate for Argeș County as a member of the National Liberal Party (PNL). While there, he served on the culture committee; his term expired at the following election. In May 2012, he was named Culture Minister in the new Victor Ponta cabinet, but was forced out of office the following month when the High Court of Cassation and Justice ruled there was a conflict of interest between his ministerial position and his managerial role at the theater.\n\nIn March 2014, when the PNL failed to include him on its list of candidates for that year's European Parliament election, Diaconu decided to run as an independent. Although his candidacy was initially rejected by the electoral authorities because the 2012 court decision had found him ineligible for political office, an appeals court placed him on the ballot, finding that he could in fact run for other offices than the one involved in the older case (that is, Senator). During the campaign, he built up the image of an independent persecuted by bureaucratic institutions determined to keep him out of office, benefiting from favorable media coverage. He won some 380,000 votes or 6.8% of the national total (ahead of two political parties that won seats), assuring him a term as an MEP. As an independent, he was only required to win 3.1% of the vote in order to secure a seat; he obtained double digits in the counties of Constanța (13.3%) and Botoșani (10.4%). He is thought to have significantly eroded the PNL vote, with one party member, Nicolae Robu, claiming Diaconu cut its performance by nearly half. In the European Parliament, he sits with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group, and is vice president of the Culture Committee.\n\nIn 1980 he married Diana Lupescu, herself an actress; the couple have two children. In 2012, he was the subject of an investigation by prosecutors for having helped hire her as a director at Nottara in 2007, despite the fact that she did not meet the necessary qualifications.\n\n"}
{"id": "26178989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26178989", "title": "Mirza Sayyed Mohammad Tabatabai", "text": "Mirza Sayyed Mohammad Tabatabai\n\nMohammad Tabatabai (Persian: آیت الله میرزا سید محمد طباطبائی, also known as Mohammad Sang-e-laji,; 22 December 1842 – 28 January 1920) was one of the leaders of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution who played an important role in the establishment of democracy and rule of law in Iran. He was the son of Sayyed Sādegh Tabātabā'i, one of the influential clerics during the reign of Naser ad-Din Shah Qajar. His paternal grandfather, Sayyed Mehdi Tabātabā'i, was a reputed clergy in Hamedan. He is the father of Sayyed Sādegh Tabātabā'i editor of \"Ruznāmeh-ye Majles\", the Majles newspaper. \n\nHe is entombed inside a family tomb in Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine in Rey.\n\nMirzā Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i was born in Karbala, Iraq. The family moved to Hamedan when he was two years old, and to Tehran, when he was eight. He received education in the sciences, (Arabic) literature, Islamic jurisprudence and doctrines from his father, and philosophy from Mirzā Abol-Hasan Jelveh. For a period of time he was also a pupil of Sahaikh Hadi Najmābādi.\nThe latter has been the spiritual father of a number of individuals who later played significant roles in bringing about the Constitutional Revolution of Iran, such as Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda and Mirza Jahangir Khan Sur-e Esrafil.\n\nIn 1881 he left Iran for the purpose of Hajj, however as a result of his late arrival, he undertook an Umrah Hajj, after which he settled in Samarra, Iraq, where he became a pupil of Ayatollah Mirzā Mohammad Hasan Hosseini Shirāzi and completed his studies with him. Following the death of his father, he took his entire family to Samarra and for some ten years advised Ayatollah Shirāzi on political matters. On the recommendation of Ayatollah Shirāzi, he finally returned to Tehran. Due to his independent mind, in Tehran he kept away from state officials and individuals in positions of power. In his public speeches, he emphasized on the merits of freedom and incessantly stirred up the sense of loving freedom amongst his audiences. In this, he went so far as to suggesting republicanism as a viable alternative to monarchism. His latter views polarised his audiences, driving some away, and attracting some more closely instead. His ascetic lifestyle, however, very effectively protected him against personal attacks by his detractors. His emphasis permanently revolved around a national government, respect for the rule of law, equality before law, and the indiscriminate application of justice in the society.\n\nThe spark leading to the Constitutional Revolution of Iran is by some held to be the foot whipping of some sugar merchants in Tehran in December 1905, by the then Governor of Tehran, Ahmad Alā od-Dowleh, for disobeying the order by the government to lower the price of sugar. Following this event, a large number of people from Bazaar, together with some clergy, took sanctuary (known as \"Bast\" ) in \"Shah's Mosque\" (\"Masjed-e Shah\" – \"Imam Khomeini Mosque\" since 1979) in Tehran. They were however forcibly removed from this place by the agents of the then Chief Minister of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah, Ain ad-Dowleh. Following this, on the suggestion of Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i a large number of Ulema of Tehran retired to Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine and formulated a set of demands to be presented to Mozaffar ad-Din Shah. The single most important demand to be made at this juncture from Shah turned out to be the demand for establishing an \"Edālat'khāneh\" (عدالتخانه - House of Justice), of which the specifics were left unspecified. According to Keddie, this lack of detail may have been intended for preserving unity amongst the more radical modernizers and the traditional Ulema. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah accepted the demand for setting up an \"Edālat'khāneh\" and for good measure also dismissed the unpopular Governor of Tehran. Following this, the Ulema ceased their protest and returned to Tehran. The \"Edālat'khāneh\" was to be the genesis of what later became Iran's \"Majles\".\n\nMozaffar ad-Din Shah and his Chief Minister, Ain od-Dowleh, reneged however on their promises. Not only did they not establish an \"Edālat'khāneh\", but violence against people continued unabated, both in Tehran and in other provinces of Iran. At this stage popular preachers such as Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani (father of the celebrated Iranian writer Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh) and Shaikh Mohammad Vā'ez began their most vociferous attacks on the establishment. This led to Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani being ordered to leave Tehran, an act that led to strong protests by the public. In the course of ousting Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani from Tehran, a young Sayyed (a descendant of prophet Mohammad) was shot dead by an officer, an event that led to a large mass of clergy leaving Tehran in protest and taking \"Bast\" in Qom in July 1906. This move was followed by between 12,000 and 14,000 merchants and tradesmen taking \"Bast\" in the British Legation in Tehran, bringing the commerce in Tehran to virtual standstill. In passing, it should be remarked that the orthodox historical view in the present-day Iran is that the role of the British at this juncture in the history of Iran was by no means a benevolent one, but calculated, the calculation being aimed at marginalising the religious elements of the revolutionary movement. It is well known that it was for exactly the lack of clarity as regards the role of Islam in a post-revolution era that such Constitutional Revolutionary of the first hour as Sheikh Fazlollah Noori came to take the side of Mohammad-Ali Shah and became an anti-revolutionary. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the status of Sheikh Fazlollah Noori as a revolutionary has been fully restored. \n\nDuring this time Iranians began to increase their demands, demanding not only the dismissal of Shah's Chief Minister, Ain od-Dowleh, but also establishment of a national consultative assembly, what came to be known as, and become, \"Majles\". The name of \"Mashrouteh\" (مشروطه), signifying a new political system, was floated around this time. At the end of July 1906, Mozaffar al-Din Shah dismissed his unpopular Chief Minister Ain od-Dowleh, and in early August 1906 he accepted the proposed institution of \"Majles\". The first \"Majles\" came into being in October 1906, immediately after the Deputies of Tehran were elected. A committee of experts drafted the \"Fundamental Law\", which Mozaffar al-Din Shah signed, after some delay, in December 1906. A longer \"Supplementary Fundamental Law\", drafted in 1907, was signed by the new Shah, Mohammad-Ali Shah, in October 1907 (Mozaffar al-Din Shah died on 3 January 1907). These two charters formed the core of the Iranian written Constitution, to be supplanted by a new written Constitution after the Revolution of 1979.\n\nThe rules governing the election of Deputies of \"Majles\" were originally drafted by Mozaffar al-Din Shah. His delay in making this document available led Mirzā Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i to visiting him personally at Sāheb'qrāniyeh Palace for enquiry. He left the Palace with the draft of these regulations in his hands. After some changes in this draft, it was finally ratified by Mozaffar al-Din Shah. Copies of this were subsequently dispatched to all cities in Iran. This event was celebrated on Monday 10 September 1906 by ornamenting the streets of Tehran with decorative light bulbs.\n\nTabatabai died in Tehran in 1920, at the age of 77.\n\nOf the religious minority groups in Iran, only Zoroastrians had a Zoroastrian Deputy in First \"Majles\". During the legislative period of this \"Majles\", Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i deputised also the Iranian Christians in \"Majles\". During this period, the Iranian Jewish community were deputised by Ayatollah Sayyed Abdollah Behbahāni.\n\nAccording to Keddie, Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i \"appears to have had genuinely liberal proclivities and considerable contact with other liberals, believed that a constitution would be the best way to limit the power of uncontrolled autocrats who were selling Iran to the Western powers.\"\n\nWith the sudden rise in the price of sugar in 1905 (see above), Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i proposed that instead of serving tea at religious gatherings, such as at \"Rozeh-Khāni\"'s, the poor be given cash. In making this suggestion, he was also aiming at improving the state of public health, as he believed that not in all large gatherings the tea was being served in hygienically clean utensils, thus spreading transferable diseases amongst the population.\n\nSayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i founded the \"Islāmieh School\" (مدرسه اسلامیه) in Tehran where modern teaching methods were used. He appointed his brother, Assad'o'llah Tabātabā'i, as the Head of this school. During a celebration, on 28 October 1905, Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i delivered a speech to the school in which he expanded on the necessity of learning and establishment of modern schools in Iran.\n\n\n\n"}

He is retired from the (interfaith) Graduate School of Philosophy and Religions, Abac Assumption University (Thailand), where he was professor of philosophy and religious studies; and from National Taiwan University, where he was distinguished chair professor in the Graduate School of Liberal Arts. In 1983–84, he taught and researched at Tamkang University in Taiwan while on sabbatical from Purdue University, where he had taught since 1969 and been a (full) professor since 1981. In 1985 he moved to the Orient, taking up residence there \"en permanence\". He continued publication in Buddhism and deconstruction and also did interdisciplinary writing and conferencing on postmodernism (in literature and Religious Studies) throughout this period. A Carmelite lay tertiary (1982–present), he began to write more extensively both on the application of Derridean thought-motifs to Catholic theology, and on Catholic meditation (see Christian Meditation and see Contemplation), making an invited presentation in 1999 on ‘Catholic Meditation in Tibetan Vajrayana Form’ for the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Federation of Asian Bishops Councils (See \"Proceedings\" for 2nd Day, Feb. 2, 1999, here).\n\nIn Thailand since 1994, he researched Theravada Buddhism and also underwent training in Vipassanā-Satipatthana meditation (Wat Mahathat, Bangkok). He organized and chaired the Thai delegation of Buddhist and Catholic scholars from Assumption University to the quadrennial international meetings of the Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies (1996, 2000), having begun presenting papers there in 1992. After a return of two years to teaching in Taiwan, he formally retired from university teaching as of summer, 2002, and currently lives in the United States of America where his three children, Lorinda-marie, Jon-carlo, and Clara-marie, and his several grandchildren reside.

He was educated at the Dragon School (in Oxford) and then Winchester College. He won a scholarship to New College, Oxford where he studied mathematics and classics. In 1934, he went to study topology at Princeton University, obtaining a PhD in 1937 with Solomon Lefschetz as his supervisor. At Princeton he met fellow English mathematician Alan Turing. He became a fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1938/1939.\n\nDuring World War II, Turing had been recruited to work at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. Turing wrote to Wylie around December 1940, who was by then teaching at Wellington College, inviting him to work at Bletchley Park. He accepted, and arrived in February 1941. He joined Turing's section, Hut 8, which was working on solving the Enigma machine as used by the \"Kriegsmarine\". He became head of the crib subsection, and allocated time on the bombe codebreaking machines.\nHugh Alexander, successor to Turing as head of Hut 8, commented that \"except for Turing, no-one made a bigger contribution to the success of Hut 8 than Shaun Wylie; he was astonishingly quick and resourceful and contributed to theory and practice in a number of different directions\".\n\nWylie transferred in Autumn 1943 to work on \"Tunny\", a German teleprinter cipher. He married Odette Murray, a WREN in the section. In 1945, soon after the victory in Europe, Wylie demonstrated how Colossus — electronic machines used to help solve Tunny — could have been used unmodified to break the Tunny \"motor wheels\", a task which had been previously done by hand. While at Bletchley Park, he became president of the dramatic club. He had also played international hockey for Scotland, but according to fellow codebreaker I. J. Good, he \"never mentioned any of his successes\".\n\nAfter the war, he was a fellow at Trinity Hall until 1958 and lectured in mathematics. He was the Ph.D. advisor for Frank Adams, Max Kelly, Crispin Nash-Williams, William Tutte and Christopher Zeeman. With Peter Hilton, he authored \"Homology Theory: An Introduction to Algebraic Topology\", published in 1960.\n\nIn 1958, he became Chief Mathematician at GCHQ, the UK signals intelligence organisation. In July 1969, he was sent a draft paper by James H. Ellis, another GCHQ mathematician, about the possibility of what was termed \"non-secret encryption\", or what is now more commonly known as public-key cryptography, on which Wylie commented \"unfortunately, I can't see anything wrong with this\". He retired in 1973, and taught at Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (later Hills Road Sixth Form College) in Cambridge for seven years. He was elected an honorary fellow at Trinity Hall in 1980.\n\nWylie supervised five PhD students at Cambridge, through whom he has 1037 \"descendants\" according to the American Mathematical Society Mathematical Genealogy Project. In addition he influenced the intellectual development of generations of pupils at the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys / Hills Road Sixth Form College where he taught maths and classical Greek and where he also produced plays, such as Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\" and coached the school Chess Team which rather than playing other schools, played and usually won against college and university teams. He also came out of retirement temporarily to teach Mathematics at Long Road Sixth Form College.\n\nAfter retirement from teaching, Wylie was instrumental in the founding of the Liberal Democrats and in the Cambridge-based University of the Third Age (U3A) and at the time of his death was preparing to read in the next Cambridge Greek Play, Aeschylus' \"Agamemnon\".\n\nShaun \"Doc\" Wylie, as he was known to his pupils and students, possessed an incisive insightful intellect and was a man who brought good humour to those around.

He was an inspiration to those who came in contact with him.\n\nHis eldest son, the late Keith Wylie (1945–1999), a barrister, was a croquet international and open champion of Great Britain.\n\nHe died on 2 October 2009.\n\n\n"}

While working as a labourer on the \"Dawson Road Project\", he moved on to Winnipeg where he met John Christian Schultz and fell under the influence of the adherents to the Canadian Party. His political involvement in the Red River Settlement from then on led to his capture at Fort Garry where he was held hostage with others. On 4 March 1870 Scott was marched out of Fort Garry's east gate and was executed on the wall by the provisional government of the Red River Settlement led by Louis Riel.\n\nScott's execution led to the Wolseley Expedition – a military force said to be sent to protect Canada from American annexation, but widely believed to confront Louis Riel and the Métis at the Red River Settlement, authorized by Sir John A. Macdonald. Thomas Scott's execution highlights a time of severe conflict between settlers and the Métis in Canadian history. His execution led to Riel's exile, and to Riel's own execution for treason in 1885.\n\nLittle is known of Thomas Scotts' early years. He was born in the Clandeboye area of County Down, in what is today Northern Ireland in 1820. Raised as a Presbyterian, he became an active Orangeman. Scott emigrated to Ontario in 1863 along with his step-brothers, Joseph Bath and Christian Aiello. On his arrival at Red River, he worked as a labourer on the \"Dawson road\" project, connecting the Red River and Lake Superior. He took part in a strike in 1869, for which he was fired and convicted of aggravated assault. Scott then moved to Winnipeg, where he met John Christian Schultz and became a supporter of the Canadian Party. Scott backed the annexation of the Red River Settlement to Canada, and the rest of his life revolved around this conflict. Scott had persecuted many metis, or \"Half Breeds\" in Winnipeg, and his first town, Ottawa, with a mysterious man named Gnez Noel.\n\nScott was employed by the Canadian government as a surveyor during the Red River Rebellion. He was first arrested and imprisoned in December 1869 at Upper Fort Garry by Louis Riel and his men while trying to attack the fort along with 34 other volunteers. Thomas Scott had briefly escaped Upper Fort Garry in January with John Christian Schultz and Charles Mair. In February 1870, Scott, alongside several volunteers amassed a rescue party outside John Christian Schultz's house in Kildonan that sought to free any remaining prisoners at Fort Garry. Summarily, the Métis released the prisoners and the rescue party was dispersed. Scott and several volunteers marched to Portage, but passed too close to Fort Garry, where Scott was captured and imprisoned by Riel's garrison once again. Charles Mair and John Christian Schultz travelled through America and later reached Ontario to urge the government for an extensive military expedition to the Red River Settlement. The joint-military operation of the Wolseley Expedition dispatched the Ontario 1st and 60th rifles alongside British troops in May 1870. It has been reported that Thomas Scott suffered severe diarrhea during his second incarceration, which was said to have had a negative effect on both Scott and his captors. During his captivity, Scott was an extraordinarily difficult, opinionated, and verbally abusive individualist who refused to acknowledge his captors' legal authority. There is some evidence that Thomas had an altercation with a group of guards that had brought him out and injured him so severely that Louis Riel had him locked into another cell with a stronger lock, partly for his own safety. It has also been documented that Scott's fellow prisoners had asked that he be removed due to his obnoxious behaviour while in captivity. He was eventually executed for committing insubordination following a trial.\n\nWhile in jail, Scott became a nuisance as he caused trouble with the guards and made attempts at escaping. He was then brought in front of a court where they found him guilty of defying the authority of the Provisional Government, fighting with guards, and slandering the name of Louis Riel. Scott was not alone in being sentenced to death, but the other sentences were never carried out. On 4 March 1870, unlike the other members of his group, he faced the firing squad. His execution was watched by 100 bystanders. Many eyewitnesses disagree on multiple aspects of Scott's execution from disagreement on his last words and actions to the manner of his death. What is agreed upon is that he was shot while blindfolded by a firing squad against the east side gate of Upper Fort Garry. It was reported that Scott was kneeling in the snow praying fervently up until he was shot. Other witnesses reported that he had been yelling wildly that his execution was unjust and that his execution was murder. The weapons that were used by the firing squad were ordinary hunting weapons (supposedly muskets) and it was observed that the men who shot these guns were intoxicated. At the time of fire, the men in the firing squad stood 60 meters away from Scott. It was also debated whether or not Scott died immediately when shot by the firing squad.\n\nMétis leader John Bruce claimed that only two bullets from the firing squad actually hit Scott, wounding him once in the left shoulder, and once in the upper chest. A man came forward and discharged his pistol close to Scott's head, but the bullet only penetrated the upper part of the left cheek and came out somewhere near the cartilage of the nose. Still not dead, Scott was placed in a makeshift coffin, from which he was later reported to cry:\nJohn Bruce said that he was left there to die of his injuries.\n\nA similar account was reported by Reverend George Young, who was told by Major George Robinson that Scott was confined to a roughly made coffin on the presumption that he had died when shot on by the firing squad. Robinson said that five hours later he and Riel entered the room where Scott's coffin was being kept and heard Scott beg for death. Robinson fled the room, Riel closed the door and, a few moments later, Robinson heard a shot and presumed that Scott was then dead. This account was cast into suspicion, though, as Riel had fired Robinson as the editor of \"New Nation\" on 19 March 1870, so it remains unclear whether or not these accounts are based in fact or acted to defame Riel in retaliation for Robinson's dismissal. \n\nUpon Scott's death, Reverend George Young forwarded Thomas Scott's documents to his brother Hugh. These documents included Scott's commendatory letters and certificates of good character written by Presbyterian minister of whose church Scott had been connected to in Ireland. Additionally his life savings were sent to his brother. It has been suspected that because it was a such substantial amount ($103.50), that this money might have indicated an immoral lifestyle.\n\nIt is not known where Scott's body was laid to rest. In 1870, the supposed burial site of Thomas Scott was revisited by a party of men led by Reverend Young. The purpose of this expedition was to bring his body back to Ontario. The party found the reported site of his burial just outside the Hudson's Bay Company store, dug 6 feet down. There they discovered the fruit tree box that was meant to be Scott's coffin. The box was discovered partially open and measuring 5 feet, 8 inches in length. No body was found once the box was opened. The box contained only dirt and shavings of some sort. The length of the box has thrown into question whether Scott had ever been buried at that site. He was 6 feet, 2 inches tall and would not have fit into this makeshift coffin which had been said to have been nailed shut. Later, John Bruce claimed that Goblet, a man who had attended the actual funeral, had told him that a week after Scott's execution a hole had been cut in the ice of German Creek about a quarter of a mile from the mouth of the River La Seine. Scott's body was brought to this site and tied in heavy chains and then sunk into the water. Another theory is that his body was taken out of the coffin by a Fenian Winnipeger, the proprietor of the Red Saloon, under whose floor it was buried. Years later, when the site of the business was torn up for road construction, a skeleton was found. Some suggest that the skeleton belonged to Thomas Scott.\n\nThough relatively unknown during his lifetime, once news of Scott's death made it to Ontario he was regarded as a martyr by the English-speaking, Protestant population. With opinions divided along ethnic lines during the century following Scott's death, English speaking historians have depicted the execution of Thomas Scott as the murder of an innocent victim. His execution was used to explain Louis Riel's fall from federally recognized politics. It was held that Riel could not be dealt with legitimately because he was seen as a murderer by Ontario. Additionally, the marginalization of Métis peoples in Canada was justified by the Anglo-Canadians memory of a brutal murder dealt to one of their own (Thomas Scott).\n\nBy contrast, French Canadian speakers and sympathizers have emphasized Scott's problematic behaviour, as mentioned above. It was stated by historian Lyle Dick that the martyrdom of Scott created a \"rallying symbol\" for expansionists who wanted the armed force be sent to the Northwest. This fostered higher recruitment rates for the Red River Expedition and hastened its dispatch. Upon learning about Scott's death, the Canadian government dispatched the Wolseley Expedition to Fort Garry from Ontario to seize the fort and force Louis Riel, now branded a murderer, to flee the settlement. Scott's religious affiliation to the Orange Order had repercussions in Ontario as well. The Toronto Globe had published an article that stated, Scott was cruelly murdered by the enemies of the Queen, country and religion.\n\nThe Red River Settlement was reportedly affected by the execution of Thomas Scott as well. It was said that the Red River Settlement had adopted a new social atmosphere following Scott's execution of sullen hostility towards the leadership of Louis Riel. On 14 April 1870, Sir John A. Macdonald had written to the Earl of Carnarvon, that Thomas Scott's men were calling for retribution against Riel for the unjust murder of Thomas Scott. The Scott incident was known to intensify and complicate negotiations with the provisional Red River government and Ontario. Shortly after the death of Thomas Scott, the Manitoba Act was passed and the creation of the Canadian province of Manitoba had occurred.\n\nThe Thomas Scott Memorial Orange Hall was constructed in 1902 and is located on Princess Street in Winnipeg. The hall was named in commemoration of Scott.\nThomas Scott and his execution is portrayed in sources by many historians controversially. As mentioned, there is plenty of speculation of his behavior in prison, the event of his execution and the way in which he died and was laid to rest. In Louis Riel (comics), Chester Brown portrays Scott as a nuisance. According to Brown, Scott was aggravating, insulting, and rude while imprisoned in Fort Garry. These qualities are supposedly what may have led to his execution. In the George Bloomfield directed movie, Riel (film), Thomas Scott's trial and execution is briefly portrayed. He is depicted as loud and uses offensive words such as \"savage.\" He is only depicted in this way however, after he is convicted and led to his execution.\n\nJ. M. Bumsted, a specialist on the topic of the Red River Rebellion, also discusses many popular portrayals of Thomas Scott in his work, \"Thomas Scott's Body: And Other Essays on Early Manitoba History.\" It is important to note that even Bumsted stresses that many stories may have been elaborated on. According to Bumsted, Louis Riel explains Scott's execution for two reasons. First, Scott's negative behavior and actions while in prison, as described by many other historians. Second, Scott is portrayed simply as a pawn being played in a bigger political game. Historians who expand on the behavioral issues claim that both the guards and other captors were aggravated by Scott's words and actions. He is said to have been threatening towards Riel and the guards and used constant obscene language. It is argued in some works that these behaviors are typical of captives who believe they are held unjustly, which Scott certainty believed. Also mentioned earlier, Scott is reported to have suffered diarrhea. It is commonly said by historians that this would have caused him aggravation, resulting in his negative behavior. The diarrhea combined with the annoying behavior however, is argued to have been reason to execute Scott as he was too much to deal with. Bumsted also discusses Scott's portrayal as a \"ringleader\" in a labour strike against Dawson Road superintendent John Snow, leading to justification for execution. Scott is also portrayed as a heavy drinker and a \"barroom brawler.\" Contradictory, Scott is also portrayed in some works as being quiet and inoffensive, just powerful and determined. His execution in these stories is portrayed as being a factor of a personal animosity between him and Riel. This animosity is depicted in many different versions ranging from Scott offending Riel by telling him to move out of his way on the street, to a rivalry over love for the same women. This version has Scott rescuing a Metisse named Marie from a flood. Scott subsequently protected Marie from Riel and his \"clumsy\" courtship of her. This led to a hatred of Scott by Riel, causing him to want him executed.\n\nAccording to Bumsted, the only thing commonly agreed throughout these depictions is that Scott's execution was a political mistake by Louis Riel and the Metis.\n\n"}

It was important that humanitarian personnel had safe and unimpeded access and the coming into force of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict was welcomed. The Council further noted that enlisting children under the age of 15 into the national armed forces was classified as a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe resolution supported the call of the Secretary-General Kofi Annan for an \"era of application\" international standards concerning the protection of children in armed conflict. Parties to conflict that were using child soldiers were called upon to end such practices while a dialogue would be established with the parties to develop plans to end their recruitment and use. There was concern at the list of parties violating their international obligations attached in the annex of the Secretary-General's report and further steps would be taken.\n\nMember States were called upon to adopt measures through national legislation to control arms trafficking in states that did not respect international law (the Fourth Geneva Convention) relating to the military use of children and protection of civilians during war. The Council was determined to include provisions for the protection of children in the mandates of peacekeeping operations. There was concern at reports of sexual exploitation of women and children, particularly cases involving humanitarian workers and United Nations peacekeepers. \n\nThe Security Council requested the implementation of counselling and HIV/AIDS testing services for United Nations peacekeepers, police and humanitarian personnel. All concerned parties and other states were called upon to ensure that the rights of children were incorporated into peace and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration processes, and to abide by commitments made to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu. \n\nFinally, the Secretary-General was instructed to submit a report by 31 October 2003 on the implementation of the current resolution, including a specific section on the protection of children in all of his future country-specific reports. \n\n\n"}
