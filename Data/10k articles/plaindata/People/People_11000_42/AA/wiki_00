Matei Cantacuzino belonged to the Phanariote Greek Cantacuzino family, which had long settled in the Danubian Principalities.\n\nAlexandros Kantakouzinos was born during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792, during which Russia occupied parts of the Danubian Principalities for several years. In 1791, Matei Cantacuzino entered Russian service, and the family followed the departing Russian troops to the Russian Empire. Alexandros Kantakouzinos served as a chamberlain to the Russian tsar. As young man, he married the Ukrainian noblewoman Elisabeta Darahan, a grand-niece of the last Hetman of Ukraine, the last sovereign lord of the Zaporozhian Cossacks. The matrimony made Alexandros a married-in-member of the influential Rozumovski clan – his wife's cousins, who at this time held such eminent positions as Ambassador to the Austrian court in Vienna, and Minister of Education in St. Petersburg. His brother, Grigore Cantacuzino-Deleanu served in the Imperial Russian Army and rose to the rank of colonel, before being killed in the Battle of Borodino in 1812 against Napoleon's invasion of Russia.\n\nIn 1812, after another Russo-Turkish war, Eastern Moldavia was annexed to the Russian Empire, and Alexandros' father, his mother and his siblings and their families returned to their ancestral home. In 1821, along with his brother Gheorghe (1786–1857), Alexandros joined the forces of Alexandros Ypsilantis, the leader of the Greek secret society \"Filiki Etaireia\", when he crossed the Pruth into Moldavia and launched an anti-Ottoman revolt. The rebellion in the Danubian Principalities was swiftly crushed, but before its final defeat, Ypsilantis sent his younger brother Dimitrios along with Alexandros Kantakouzinos to the Peloponnese in Greece, where a parallel rebellion had broken out in March.\n\nKantakouzinos participated in the capture of Monemvasia and the Siege of Tripolitsa, but in 1822 he fell out with Dimitrios Ypsilantis and joined the camp of his rival, the Phanariote Alexandros Mavrokordatos. He later left Greece and settled in Dresden. He returned to Greece in 1829, after Count Ioannis Kapodistrias became Governor of Greece. As Greek independence became internationally recognized, he bought up the estates (\"çifliks\") of several Ottoman grandees in Attica, most notably the \"mufti\" of Athens and Omer Pasha of Karystos, from whom he purchased Tatoi (the future summer residence of the Greek royal family).\n\nAlexandros Kantakouzinos died in 1841 in Athens.\n\nHis children included:\n\n"}

His death influenced changes in the way Victoria Police respond to people presenting as mentally ill, and in the use of tasers.\n\nTyler Jordan Cassidy was shot by police and died on 11 December 2008 at All Nations Park in Northcote, Victoria. Before the shooting Cassidy had armed himself with two large knives which he had stolen from a nearby shopping centre and threatened members of the public, insisting that they call the police. In the park, police demanded that Cassidy drop the knives, but he did not. After attempting to subdue Cassidy twice with OC spray, three officers fired ten shots from their Smith & Wesson Model 10 .38 Special revolvers, with five of these striking Cassidy. \n\nThe Coroners Court of Victoria found that there was much public commentary of the incident and that the death of \"a 15-year-old boy at the hands of the Victoria Police both shocked and bewildered us as a community.\" The competence and impartiality of the internal police investigation was questioned. The Coroner's Inquest heard 34 days of evidence from 63 witnesses and the brief of evidence was 3,710 pages long.\n\nFrom the inquest: \"He [Cassidy] had been capsicum-sprayed twice without effect and advanced on an officer who became trapped at the top of a skate park bowl, the coroner found. Three of the police fired at him after a warning shot and several shots at his legs failed to stop Tyler moving forward with the knives towards [Leading Senior Constable Colin Dods]. Tyler had been drinking excessively during the night and was found to have a post mortem blood alcohol level of between 0.09g/100ml and 0.11g/100ml.\"\n\nState Coroner Jennifer Coate rejected a submission from Cassidy's family that the officers used disproportionate force worthy of criminal charges, or that Cassidy had been standing still when he was fatally shot.\n\nThe incident was blamed on a lack of training and information gathering performed by Victoria Police. Subsequently, all police officers who might come into contact with individuals who appear to be mentally ill in the course of duty are required to undergo a two-day training course twice a year.\n\nFollowing the closing of the case by Australian police and determining that the officers acted within the bounds of their duty, Cassidy's mother, Shani Cassidy, appealed to the United Nations for a review of the process by which fatal police shootings are investigated by the Victoria Police Homicide Squad. The author of the UN submission, Anna Brown, expected no additional evidence regarding the investigation to be elicited. Among the complaints were allegations of poor investigative police work. Three of the four police officers involved attended a police function where alcohol was served the night before the fatal shooting occurred, but no alcohol or drug testing was administered at the time of the incident. Ten shots were fired but no bullets were recovered from the crime scene. Dods received a private phone call from his commanding officer immediately after the event; an issue Dods himself was highly critical about when cross examined. Gunshot residue testing was significantly delayed, possibly leading to inconclusive results. No reconstruction was requested of the officers.\n\nShani Cassidy made complaints over the integrity of Victoria Police. She alleged that her son's name was disclosed to the media as well as a \"demonising\" report of the incident less than three hours of it occurring. Assistant Commissioner Cartwright, then the appointed officer for communicating with the media regarding the event, was accused of disclosing Cassidy's name by the family's counsel, but Victoria Police has strongly denied these accusations.\n\nAt one time Shani Cassidy was secretly recorded by homicide detectives during an interview. Her appeal to the UN raised her complaint that following the incident Victoria Police attempted to exculpate themselves.\n\nIn June 2015, \"The Age\" reported that this Wikipedia page had been edited by Victoria Police at least 17 times to November 2014, apparently to give a more favourable impression of the officers' conduct and the subsequent investigation.\n\nFormer chief commissioner of Victoria Police Christine Nixon has suggested that Cassidy's death prompted further community debate about the use of Tasers by Victoria Police. In 2010 Tasers were trialed in Bendigo and Morwell \"because of the high use of OC spray, incidents involving people with a mental illness, sieges and instances where offenders have used weapons.\" In 2016 Tasers were made more widely available to Victoria Police. Deputy Commissioner Wendy Steendam said \"What Tasers do for our members is to actually offer them another option in resolutions of incidents where they're having violent confrontations or where people are attempting to self-harm.\"\n\nIn May 2016, lawyer Michael McDonald was found to have defamed Sergeant Colin Dods and ordered to pay damages. Justice Kevin Bell described the defamatory comments, made online, as \"very grave. The publication caused (Sergeant Dods) to suffer continuing intense distress, humiliation and embarrassment and thereby great harm in his reputation,\" the judge said.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3062381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3062381", "title": "Dieudonné Saive", "text": "Dieudonné Saive\n\nDieudonné Joseph Saive (23 May 1888 – 12 October 1970) was a Belgian small arms designer who designed several well-known firearms for Belgian armsmaker Fabrique Nationale, including the FN Model 1949 and the FN FAL (\"Fusil Automatique Leger\" or Light Automatic Rifle). He is also known for modifying several of John Browning's firearms designs, including the 1931 Baby Browning and Browning Hi-Power pistol.\n\nIn 1921, the French military requested that Fabrique Nationale create a new semi-automatic nine millimetre pistol with a 15-round magazine. John Browning, who was FN's chief weapons designer, initially declined to respond to the French request because he felt standard single-row magazines holding seven or eight rounds (such as was used in his Colt's Model 1911) were sufficient. Saive, who was then Browning's assistant at FN, set to work designing a high-capacity, double-row magazine. Saive mated his experimental magazine to a modified FN Model 1903 for testing. Saive then provided the completed magazine to Browning who developed two 9 mm pistol designs using locked and unlocked breeches. Browning and Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Co. submitted a U.S. patent application for the locked-breech version of the pistol on June 28, 1923. The patent was granted on February 22, 1927, four months after Browning's death at FN's plant in Liège, Belgium. Colt's elected to concentrate on manufacturing its hugely successful Model 1911 instead of either of Browning's new 9 mm pistols so Browning's son Val offered the design to FN. This pistol design, modified after Browning's death, was offered as the 13-shot FN Browning Model 1922 or \"Grand Rendement\" (meaning High Yield).\nFollowing the expiration of the patents on the Model 1911, Saive redesigned the \"Grand Rendement\" to incorporate the best features of both pistols in the FN Model 1928, which still bore Browning's name.\n\nIn 1928 Saive traveled to Yugoslavia to set up the state arsenal in Kragujevac.\n\nIn 1929, Saive returned to Belgium where he oversaw the manufacture of the commercial version of the Browning Automatic Rifle. By 1930, Saive was promoted to become FN's chief weapons designer (\"Chef de Service\"). Saive improved the operating mechanism of the .30 cal. M1919 Browning M2 AN aircraft machine gun in 1932, increasing its rate of fire to 1,200 rpm. In 1938, he made additional improvements to the M2 further increasing its rate of fire to 1,500 rpm.\nDuring the same period, Saive continued to improve the \"Grand Rendement,\" and by 1934 the French term \"Grande Puissance\" (\"Hi-Power\") was first applied to the evolved design which became the French GP-35 self-loading pistol or FN Browning Hi-Power.\nThe Hi-Power was the first 9×19mm handgun to utilize a true staggered-column magazine. The large magazine enabled the weapon to carry a total of fourteen cartridges without an excessively oversized or protruding handgrip.\n\nFrance declined to adopt the \"Hi-Power\" for its armed forces, instead using the Modèle 1935 pistol. Despite this rejection, the \"Hi-Power\" was a sales success with more than 56,000 produced by May 1940, mostly for the Belgian military. It was used extensively in World War II by many nations including the British Commonwealth and Chinese forces. More than 65,000 Hi-Power pistols were also used by German forces, renamed \"Pistole 640(b)\", after the Nazis captured FN's manufacturing plant in Liège on May 12, 1940.\nSaive fled the German invasion, eventually arriving in London in mid-1941. He was soon at work at the Enfield Design Department at the Drill Hall in Cheshunt, England, recreating production drawings for the Hi-Power and further developing his design for a gas-operated rifle called the \"EXP-1\", later the FN \"Model 1949\". By June 1943, the British modified Saive's technical drawings to produce the \"Mk. I U.K.\" model of the \"Hi-Power\".\nIn April 1943, China requested 180,000 Hi-Powers with hollow wooden shoulder stocks that also served as holsters through a Mutual Aid Plan with Canada. The Chinese were familiar with the C96 Mauser Broomhandle that came with a stock/holster and wanted the same thing for the Hi-Powers they requested. The Canadian contract was with the Inglis firm who hired Dieudonné Saive and Rene Laloux, both Belgian engineers, to work on production. After the war, the Browning \"Hi-Power\" was adopted as the standard military service sidearm of many Western countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia. Slightly modernized versions remain in production today, three-quarters of a century later.\n\nSaive's Gas-Operated Rifle Designs\n\nSaive is most famous for his series of gas-operated self-loading rifle designs, which used a tipping bolt to lock the action. His \"FN-49\" rifle went into production, and was later developed into the widely successful \"FN FAL\" selective-fire battle rifle.\n\n\n"}

During his career, he served in World War One, commanded Company K of the 372nd Infantry Regiment ultimately rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was President of the West Medford Men's Community Club and Chair of the Citizen's Committee bringing Boy Scouts Troop No. 11 to the area. Dugger was the first African American to be appointed to the Medford City Planning Board and to have a Medford public park named after him, \"Dugger Park.\" Dugger died in 1939.\n\nDugger was born in Finchley, Virginia, on June 6, 1894. As a young boy he moved with his family to Natick, Massachusetts, where he received his elementary education and was a member of the Boys' Patrol. Dugger's family eventually moved to Boston and he attended Boston English High. During his high school years, he was a track star and a member of his school's military regiment. Upon graduation in 1914, Dugger signed up for the National Guard and later enlisted in the famous Company L of the 6th Massachusetts Infantry. He was commissioned first lieutenant on October 14, 1917 at Fort Des Moines, and weeks later married a West Medford native, Madeline Mabray Kountze.\n\nIn June 1918, Dugger began his duty overseas. The British had been training American soldiers as they arrived but refused to train the 92nd and 93rd Divisions. To avoid trouble, the United States turned these men over to the French Army, who had been requesting extra troops. In addition to racism, the men faced the many maladies of war. Dugger's son, Cortland, recounts:\n\n\"They slept in the trenches... Everything they did — they ate, they did, they fought in the trenches... in rain, sleet, whatever else, cold weather. It was an awful war... You know they were gassed, their clothing wasn't adequate, they had a whole host of diseases over the place.\"\n\nDugger won distinction for bravery and returned home in March 1919. He joined the Boston Police Force and later the Postal Service, where he worked until his retirement fifteen years later. Edward and Madeline had six children between 1919 and 1930, and had a house built on Jerome Street in West Medford for their big family. During this time period, Dugger had been commissioned a Major and made Captain of Company K of the 372nd Infantry Regiment. He became the commanding officer in December 1930 and devoted much of his energy to the unit until his retirement in 1936.\n\nAt home and in the community, Dugger served as a model of duty and leadership. He was President of the West Medford Men's Community Club and Chair of the Citizen's Committee that brought Boy Scouts Troop No. 11 to the area. In 1936, he was appointed the first black member of the Medford City Planning Board by Mayor Irwin. However he would serve for only two years due to illness.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1938, Dugger retired from all these positions. He had been sick with polycystic kidneys for many years and found his health failing. On March 5, 1939, Dugger died in the U.S. Naval Hospital Chelsea, Massachusetts, at the age of 44.\n\nLater in 1939, for the first time in its history, the City of Medford honored an African American citizen in naming a public park after him. Called the \"Dugger Park\", the area along the Mystic River at Harvard Avenue has grown to include tennis and basketball courts, a baseball field, and a playground. Attorney Matthew Bullock remarked at the dedication that the park was \"destined to be a large factor in moulding the lives of the children of this community.\" And indeed it was. The park plays host to myriad community events and a sign post at the intersection of Harvard Avenue and Mystic River Road boasts graffiti letting passersby know that local children consider it: \"The Action Plase [sic]\" .\n\nIn addition to Dugger Park, the Medford Public Library, has an exhibit about Dugger under \"Leaders in the Military.\"\n"}

He wrote for many Italian papers and contributed to the press in France, Great Britain and Belgium. He was also a prolific novelist, mainly focused on religious themes.\n\nBorn at Moliterno, Basilicata, at the time part of the Kingdom of Naples, his birth name was Ferdinando Petruccelli and he added \"della Gattina\" (name of a farm of his own) to his surname in order to avoid the Bourbon police who persecuted him for political reason. His father Luigi was a physician and member of the Carbonari while his mother Maria Antonia Piccininni was a noblewoman from Marsicovetere.\n\nGrown up in religious circles and because of the abuses received as a child, he developed a strong anticlericalism which will be reflected in his works. During his young age, he devoted himself to the study of Latin and Greek. Later, he attended the University of Naples, graduating in medicine but he chose the path of journalism.\n\nIn 1838, he began his career for the Neapolitan newspaper \"Omnibus\" and, in 1840, he traveled to France, Great Britain and Germany as a correspondent for \"Salvator Rosa\" and \"Raccoglitore fiorentino\". Because of his liberal ideas, he was arrested for his membership in Young Italy and was sent under guard to his native town.\n\nReturned to Naples in 1848, Petruccelli was elected deputy of the Neapolitan parliament and founded \"Mondo vecchio e mondo nuovo\", a newspaper who accused the Bourbon dynasty of misgovernment in both internal and foreign policy and, for the frequent attacks on the crown, it was suppressed by the magistracy. After the suspension of the constitution promulgated by the king Ferdinand II few months before, he took part in the riots of the same year. The revolt failed and he was forced to escape to France, while the government sentenced him to death and confiscated his properties.\n\nDuring his French residence, he broadened his political and cultural horizons, thanks to contacts with renowned thinkers. He attended courses at the Sorbonne and the Collège de France, studied French and English literature and pursued a brilliant career as a journalist, becoming known and appreciated in Europe. Nicknamed, nicely, \"Pierre Oiseau de la Petite Chatte\" (French translation of his surname), he entered the world of French journalism thanks to Jules Simon and Daniele Manin, who appreciated the intervention of \"Mondo vecchio e mondo nuovo\" in favour of the Republic of San Marco.\n\nPetruccelli became correspondent of French and Belgian journals such as \"La Presse\", \"Journal des débats\", \"Revue de Paris\", \"Le Courrier français\" and \"Indépendance Belge\". In 1851, he fought with the French republicans against the coup d'état of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (later known as Napoleon III) but, after the failure of the rebellion, he was expelled from France. He settled in England, where he met Giuseppe Mazzini, Louis Blanc, Lajos Kossuth and other refugees. He worked for \"The Daily News\" of Charles Dickens and other newspapers like \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"Cornhill Magazine\".\n\nIn 1859, he was correspondent of the Second Italian War of Independence and, in 1860, of the Expedition of the Thousand, following Giuseppe Garibaldi from Calabria until his entry in Naples. With the birth of the Kingdom of Italy, he was a member of the Italian parliament, sitting on the benches of the left for several years, and contributed to Italian newspapers and magazines such as \"L'Unione\", \"L'Opinione\", \"Fanfulla della Domenica\", \"Cronaca bizantina\" and \"Nuova antologia\".\n\nIn 1866, Petruccelli was correspondent for the \"Journal des Débats\" during the Third Italian War of Independence and, in 1868, he married an English writer, Maude Paley-Baronet, whom he met in London in 1867. In 1870 he followed the Franco-Prussian War, recouting the events from the Parisian barricades and, after the fall of the Paris Commune, he was expelled from France by order of Adolphe Thiers (against which he turned bitter words) for having defended the Communards.\n\nHe lived the rest of his life plagued by a paralysis that prevented him from writing but, with the help of his wife, he was able to continue his activity. Petruccelli died in Paris in 1890 and his corpse was cremated. The Neapolitan municipality proposed to carry his ashes to the cemetery of Poggioreale but his wife refused and they were buried in London, respecting the will of Petruccelli.\n\nDuring his time, Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina wasn't much appreciated in Italy, rather he was rejected by many (especially the clerical hierarchies because of his marked anticlericalism), with the exception of authors such as Salvatore Di Giacomo and Luigi Capuana. He was acclaimed in foreign countries, especially in France, where his work received positive reviews from Alphonse Peyrat, Ernest Renan and Jules Claretie, who said about his war correspondence of Custoza : \"Nothing could be more fantastic and cruelly true than this tableau of agony. Reportage has never given a superior artwork\", while Justin McCarthy regarded him as \"a brilliant, audacious, eccentric Italian journalist\". In the 20th century, Petruccelli was praised by Luigi Russo and Indro Montanelli, who considered him the \"most brilliant italian journalist of the 19th century\" and his reports \"would enchant for their freshness and modernity\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "602030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=602030", "title": "Fijians", "text": "Fijians\n\nFijians () are a nation and ethnic group native to Fiji, who speak Fijian and share a common history and culture.\n\nFijians, or \"iTaukei\", are the major indigenous people of the Fiji Islands, and live in an area informally called Melanesia. Indigenous Fijians are believed to have arrived in Fiji from western Melanesia approximately 3,500 years ago, though the exact origins of the Fijian people are unknown. Later they would move onward to other surrounding islands, including Rotuma, as well as blending with other (Polynesian) settlers on Tonga and Samoa. They are indigenous to all parts of Fiji except the island of Rotuma. The original settlers are now called \"Lapita people\" after a distinctive pottery produced locally. Lapita pottery was found in the area from 800 BCE onward.\n\nAs of 2005, indigenous Fijians constituted slightly more than half of the total Fijian population. Indigenous Fijians are predominantly of Melanesian extraction, with some Polynesian admixture.\n\nAustralia has the largest Fijian expatriate population, according to the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, while Fijians were also the fifth largest Pacific ethnic group living in New Zealand; a decrease of 8 percent between 1996 and 2001. The estimated Pacific Islander population size is 231,800 in 2001 Fijians comprising about 7,000 of that. Outside Oceania, a substantial Fijian diaspora is found in other anglophone countries, namely Canada, United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe \"Bose Levu Vakaturaga\" (Great Council of Chiefs) once passed laws and regulations governing the indigenous Fijian people. Until its disbanding by the Military of Fiji following the 2006 coup, the Great Council of Chiefs met yearly to discuss native Fijian concerns. The council, which was formerly responsible for appointing Fiji's president, was composed of 55 Fijian chiefs selected from the 14 provinces. Included in the council were three appointees from the island of Rotuma and six appointed by the Minister of Fijian Affairs. The Minister of Fijian Affairs consulted with the President as part of the selection process. Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka was given a lifetime appointment on the council.\n\nThe Tabua is a much revered whale's tooth which is used in both public and private occasions or ceremonies. The tooth is considered sacred.\n\nYaqona (pronounced yung-gohna), otherwise known as kava – another important traditional custom – is an infusion prepared from the root of \"Piper methysticum\", a type of pepper plant. The plant itself is also often referred to as yaqona or the kava plant. Yaqona is extremely important in indigenous Fijian culture – in the time of the 'old religion' it was used ceremonially by chiefs and priests only. Today, yaqona is part of daily life, both in villages and in urban areas and across all classes and walks of life. 'Having a grog' or 'drinking grog', as drinking kava is sometimes known, is used for welcoming and bonding with visitors, for storytelling sessions or merely for passing time.\n\nThe native Fijian language belongs to the Central Pacific (Fijian – Polynesian) branch of the Austronesian family.\n\nAbout 86 percent of the land in Fiji is owned by indigenous Fijian people. In 1876, Sir Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, the British colonial Governor, prohibited the sale of Fijian land to non-ethnic Fijians. This controversial policy continues today. The Governor also banned the employment of native Fijians as labourers, and in 1878, began importing indentured labourers from India to work in the sugarcane fields. The effects of this immigration created an ethnic polarisation and rampant Anti-Indian sentiment, which has proven to be politically challenging to Fijian race relations.\n\nIndigenous Fijians overwhelmingly report as being Christian, with the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma claiming the loyalty of 66.6% (1996 census). Other significant denominations include the Roman Catholic Church (13.3%), the Assemblies of God (6.2%) and the Seventh-day Adventists (5.1%). About 8% belong to other churches from a large number of denominations. Only about 0.8% report as following non-Christian religions or no religion.\n\nApproximately 70% of indigenous Fijians are farmers, many of which are sustenance farmers. They commonly grow such crops as sugar cane, cassava, rice, sweet potatoes, and bananas.\n\nHistorically, Fijians were known as the canoe building experts of the Pacific, using them to trade with Tonga. They were usually large double-hulled canoes, called a Drua (pronounced nDroo-ah), with each side being similar except one was shorter and served as a type of outrigger. These were united by beams, with a platform on it that extended beyond the sides.\n\nThe Lapita people, named after their distinctive pottery style, were the first people to inhabit Fiji in about 3000 BCE, and evidence of their settlements exist throughout Fiji – particularly around the Sigatoka Sand Dunes. They were followed by the Melanesians in about 500 BCE, and relatively recent trading with the Polynesian Tongans has added to the cultural mix. In the Lau group of islands, aspects of both cultures still intermingle. There was active commerce between Tonga and Fiji, and later in the history of this relationship, the Fijians in the Lau Islands (Eastern Fiji) became vassals to the King of Tonga. One particular reason Tongans and Samoans came to Fiji was to build the Drua (large double-hulled canoes) which they couldn't build on their own islands because of the lack of proper timber.\n\nFrom the early 19th century, both European and Chinese traders visited Fiji for its sandalwood, hardwoods, beche-de-mer, marinelife and, more recently, gold. The British ruled Fiji from 1874 to 1970. In 1970, Fiji became a fully independent nation with constitutional arrangements to ensure that traditional Fijian interests were preserved.\n\nHis Royal Highness Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, presented the Instruments of Independence to Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara on 10 October 1970 at a massive gathering at Albert Park in Suva. In 1972, the first general elections were held using the 1970 constitution. In 1987, two military coups were staged. The first coup was bloodless, and the second coup severed ties with the British Monarchy. A controversial and racially divisive new constitution was adopted in 1990, and in 1992 the first general election was held under the auspices of the new constitution.\n\nThe constitution was revised again in 1997 and was deemed to be more equitable by the many racial groups in Fiji. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a violent coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political and racial turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. Re-elected in May 2006, Qarase was ousted in a military coup on 5 December that year, led by the Commander of the Royal Fiji Military Forces (RFMF), Commodore Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama, who initially appointed himself acting President, but in January 2007 assumed the position of interim Prime Minister, promising a return to democracy in the near future. This did not eventuate, however; elections were not held until 2014.\n\n\"See main on Fijian traditions and ceremonies and Culture of Fiji.\"\n\nThe Fijian traditions and ceremonies are historically based and share commonalities throughout the time line\n\nIn August 2008, shortly before the proposed People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress was due to be released to the public, it was announced that it recommended a change in the name of Fiji's citizens. If the proposal were adopted, all citizens of Fiji, whatever their ethnicity, would be called \"Fijians\". At present, the word \"Fijian\" does not denote a nationality, and refers exclusively to indigenous Fijians. Citizens of Fiji are referred to as \"Fiji Islanders\". The proposal would change the English name of indigenous Fijians from \"Fijians\" to \"itaukei\".The indigenous word for Fijian is \"Kaiviti\" Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase reacted by stating that the name \"Fijian\" belonged exclusively to indigenous Fijians, and that he would oppose any change in legislation enabling non-indigenous Fijians to use it. The Cabinet at its meeting on 30 June 2010 approved the Fijian Affairs [Amendment] Decree 2010. The new law effectively replaces the word 'Fijian' or 'indigenous' or 'indigenous Fijian' with the word 'iTaukei' in all written laws, and all official documentation when referring to the original and native settlers of Fiji. \nAll Fiji citizens are now called 'Fijians'\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12285704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12285704", "title": "Francis Dickens", "text": "Francis Dickens\n\nFrancis Jeffrey Dickens (15 January 1844 – 11 June 1886) was the third son and fifth child of Victorian English novelist Charles Dickens and his wife Catherine Dickens née Hogarth.\n\nFrancis Dickens was nicknamed \"Chickenstalker\" by his father after the character Mrs. Chickenstalker in the Christmas book \"The Chimes\" that he was writing at the time of Francis's birth; however he came to be called Frank by those who knew him. He was born in England and went to school in Germany to train to become a doctor. Giving up this ambition, he obtained a commission in the Bengal Mounted Police and served in India for seven years.\n\nFollowing his father's death in 1870 he inherited some money, but he soon went through this, and his aunt, Georgina Hogarth (Catherine Dickens' sister) used her influence with family friend Lord Dufferin, then Governor General of Canada, to get Francis Dickens a commission in the North-West Mounted Police.\n\nDickens joined the North-West Mounted Police as a Sub Inspector in Canada in 1874 shortly after the March West which brought the original police force of 300 members to the modern provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. He would remain in the force 12 years, serving at Fort Walsh, Fort Macleod and Fort Pitt, getting promoted to Inspector in 1880.\n\nDuring the North West Rebellion of 1885, Francis Dickens was in charge of the defence of Fort Pitt on the North Saskatchewan River. Francis Dickens' diary written during his charge at Fort Pitt, though very brief, is an important document of the events of the siege that led to the evacuation of the mounted police from the fort. On his website, David J. Carter describes the events at Fort Pitt.\nThis site [Frog Lake, following Cree attacks on priests and Hudson's Bay Company employees and family members] was 35 miles northwest of Fort Pitt. Dickens sent out three scouts to reconnoitre. When they returned they were attacked by Cree warriors; one escaped unharmed, one was wounded – played dead then crawled to the 'fort', the other Constable Cowan was killed within sight of Fort Pitt. Then the warrior cut out young Cowan's heart and ate a piece of it before the horrified defenders of the fort. \nThe NWMP detachment were outnumbered and outgunned 200 to 20. Negotiations led to the civilians agreeing to become prisoners of the Cree and Big Bear. The Chief gave Dickens and his men a short time to abandon the fort. This they did, and travelled amongst the ice pans in a leaky scow. Scouts from Fort Battleford reported that everyone at Fort Pitt had been massacred; however, after six days on the river Dickens and his men arrived at Battleford and received a hero's welcome.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the Mounted Police in 1886 (for reasons of ill health — he was becoming increasingly hard of hearing among other infirmities) Frank was going to embark on a series of lecture talks in the US (as his father had successfully done), but died of a heart attack at a friend's house in Moline, Illinois the night of his first speech. He was 42 years old.\n\nContemporary portrayals of Francis Dickens (such as the character Inspector Dicken in the romantic novel \"Annette the Metis Spy\"), conformed to a conventional heroic type, reflecting the dominant view of the Rebellion held by (English-speaking) Eastern Canada. However, some of his superiors in the Mounted Police held unfavorable opinions about his overall competence, echoing his father Charles Dickens, who wrote in a letter to his friend on being asked by his son for three hundred pounds, a horse and a gun to set himself up as a gentleman farmer in the colonies, that the consequence of the first is that he would be robbed of it, the second, that it would throw him, and the third, that he would shoot his own head off.\n\nIn histories of the Mounted Police, Francis Dickens is described as a tragic character, struggling to live in the shadow of his great father. Charges against him include drunkenness, laziness and recklessness. David Carter in the third chapter of his book questions the evidence that these claims are based on. An article in a special RCMP issue of the Canadian history magazine The Beaver called \"Francis J. Dickens, An Ordinary Officer\" gives a balanced picture, pointing out his twelve years of service during which time many men in the fledging police force on the plains deserted or were discharged for misconduct, while others have gone so far as to say that he was partly responsible for the deterioration in relations between the NWMP and the Blackfoot in the 1880s!\n\nThe events surrounding Frog Lake and the battle of Fort Pitt are treated in \"The Temptations of Big Bear\" (1973) by Rudy Wiebe. In recent decades, Francis Dickens has been depicted as a comic figure. In \"W.G. Grace's Last Case\" (1984), by William Rushton, in a fantastic plot that includes fictional characters like Jekyll and Hyde and Dr. Watson, Francis Dickens encounters Apache Indians and (anachronistically) meets the famed cricketer of the title during the latter's team's 1872 North American tour. \n\nFrancis Dickens later was the subject of a comic novel by humorist Eric Nicol, \"Dickens of the Mounted\" (1989). The book is a series of fictional letters, a mock document purporting to be a record of Dickens's correspondence spanning his twelve years in Canada, only \"edited\" by Nicol. It is still frequently mistaken for non-fiction. \nFrank Dickens also appears in the science fiction novel that deals with the NWMP in an alternative history, \"The Apparition Trail\" (2004) by Lisa Smedman. \n\nIn the novels \"The Winnipeg Wolf\" and \"The Search for Spade\" belonging to the \"Inspector Bucket NWMP\" series by Jeremy Allen the leading character, Francis Bucket, is based on Francis Dickens.\nHe is played by Joe Prospero in the TV mini-series \"\". In 2007 a Fringe festival play called \"Dickens of the Mounted\" based on Nicol's novel toured several Canadian cities.\n\nFrancis Dickens is a character in Matthew Pearl's 2009 novel, \"The Last Dickens\". Dickens also appears in Bill Gallaher's \"The Frog Lake Massacre\" (2008).\n\n\n\"The Diary of Francis Dickens\", edited by Vernon LaChance, Kingston Jackson Press, 1930\n\"Francis Jeffrey Dickens\", The Canadian Encyclopedia, (entry by John Evans) \nEric Nicol, \"Dickens of the Mounted: The Astounding Long-lost Letters of Inspector F.

Roach is widely regarded as one of the best boxing trainers of all time. He is the enduring boxing coach of the eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao, five-time and four-division world champion Miguel Cotto, former WBC Middleweight Champion Julio César Chávez Jr., defensive master and three-time world champion James Toney, former UFC Middleweight and eleven-time Welterweight Champion Georges St-Pierre, as well as top prospects Jose Benavidez, Peter Quillin, and Vanes Martirosyan. Roach was the trainer of two-time women's world champion Lucia Rijker. He has also trained former junior welterweight champion Amir Khan.\n\nRoach was trained by his father Paul Roach at a young age along with his brothers Joey and Pepper. As a teenager, he was a dominant force in the New England amateur and AAU ranks. Roach turned pro in 1978, fighting as a lightweight and won his first 10 bouts. Roach trained under legendary trainer Eddie Futch and went 26–1 before appearing in a historic match at the Boston Garden on June 11, 1982.\n\nThe card that night was the first of two times that all three Fighting Roach Brothers appeared at the same time.\n\nBrothers Joey and Pepper won their undercard bouts but in the main event, Freddie lost a unanimous decision to Rafael Lopez. Freddie would rebound and go on to contend twice for regional championships. \nLate in his career, Roach, who was known for being able to take on a barrage of punches, began showing early signs of Parkinson's disease. Futch asked Roach to retire but the boxer refused and continued to fight with his father as his trainer. He went on to lose five of his last six fights before retiring at age 26. His best payday was $7,500.\n\nAfter his retirement from fighting, Roach worked in a variety of jobs around Las Vegas including telemarketing and a busboy before taking a job with his former trainer and mentor Eddie Futch as an unpaid assistant in 1986. He excelled in his new position and worked as Futch's assistant for five years.\n\nIn 1991, actor Mickey Rourke returned to boxing midway through his acting career, and hired Roach to train him in Hollywood, California. In 1995, when Rourke decided to quit boxing, he gave gym equipment to Roach, and it can be found in the Wild Card Boxing Club on Vine Street.\n\nRoach owns the Wild Card Boxing Club in Los Angeles and works alongside his brother Pepper. He is one of the most popular trainers in boxing. Roach's prized ward is eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao. Roach also once trained Oscar De La Hoya for his May 5, 2007 superfight against Floyd Mayweather Jr.. His first world champion was Virgil Hill, whom he took over from his own former trainer, Eddie Futch. He is also the former trainer for British boxers Gary Stretch (former WBC super welterweight Champion) Training Stretch for his WBO Middleweight Championship challenge against Chris Eubanks and Amir Khan, who became the WBA Light Welterweight Champion on July 18, 2009 and the IBF Light Welterweight Champion on July 23, 2011, under Roach's tutelage. Roach also trains welterweight boxer Zachary \"Kid Yamaka\" Wohlman among many others. and can usually be seen nearby when his boxers are interviewed.\n\nIn the world of mixed martial arts (MMA), Roach has trained former UFC Heavyweight Champion Andrei Arlovski and was one of his primary trainers for Arlovski's victory over Ben Rothwell on July 19 at Affliction's inaugural show. He has also trained MMA fighter Dan Hardy for his fight with Marcus Davis at UFC 99 as well as MMA greats, Tito Ortiz, Anderson Silva, and BJ Penn. In May 2010, he began a training engagement with Georges St-Pierre in advance preparation for the fighter's successful UFC welterweight title defense against Josh Koscheck at UFC 124. Roach has also trained many other prominent mixed martial artists, such as: pro-boxer and kickboxer, and former EliteXC Lightweight Champion, K.J. Noons, Roger Huerta, and Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou. In March 2010, Roach expressed interest in wanting to train former Pride FC and WAMMA Heavyweight champion, Fedor Emelianenko.\n\nRoach suffers from Parkinson's disease. \nAs chronicled in the HBO series \"Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel\", he is able to actively control the disease through medication, injections and his training of boxers. Roach's doctors feel that his active in-ring training routines with his fighters and tremendous eye-hand coordination that he has to exhibit have made it possible to slow the progress of the disease.\n\n\n\"As of August 1, 2011:\"\n\n"}
{"id": "172313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172313", "title": "Gerd Müller", "text": "Gerd Müller\n\nGerhard \"Gerd\" Müller (; born 3 November 1945) is a German retired footballer. A prolific striker renowned for his clinical finishing, especially in and around the six-yard box, he is regarded as one of the greatest goalscorers of all time.\n\nAt international level with West Germany, he scored 68 goals in 62 appearances, and at club level, after 15 years with Bayern Munich, he scored a record 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga games and an international record 66 goals in 74 European club games. Averaging more than a goal a game with West Germany, Müller is now 17th on the list of all time international goalscorers, despite playing fewer matches than every other player in the top 25. Among the top scorers, he has the third-highest goal-to-game ratio.\n\nNicknamed \"Bomber der Nation\" (\"the nation's Bomber\") or simply \"Der Bomber\", Müller was named European Footballer of the Year in 1970. After a successful season at Bayern Munich, he scored ten goals at the 1970 FIFA World Cup for West Germany where he received the Golden Boot as top goalscorer. He scored four goals in the 1974 World Cup, including the winning goal in the final. Müller held the all-time goal-scoring record in the World Cup with 14 goals for 32 years. In 1999, Müller was ranked ninth in the European player of the Century election held by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), and he was voted 13th in the IFFHS' World Player of the Century election. In 2004, Pelé named Müller in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.\n\nBorn in Nördlingen, Germany, Müller began his football career at his hometown club TSV 1861 Nördlingen. Müller joined Bayern Munich in 1964, where he teamed up with future stars Franz Beckenbauer and Sepp Maier. The club, which would go on to become the most successful German club in history, was then still in the Regionalliga Süd \"(Regional League South)\", which was one level below the Bundesliga at the time. After one season, Bayern Munich advanced to the Bundesliga and started a long string of successes. With his club, Müller amassed titles during the 1960s and 1970s: he won the German Championship four times, the DFB-Pokal four times, the European Champions' Cup three consecutive years (the first West German team to win it; Müller scored in the 1974 final replay and the 1975 final), the Intercontinental Cup once, and the European Cup Winners' Cup once.\n\nA supremely opportunistic goal-scorer, he also became German top scorer seven times and European top scorer twice. Müller scored 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga matches for Bayern Munich, almost 100 goals more than the second-most successful Bundesliga scorer, Klaus Fischer. He holds the single-season Bundesliga record with 40 goals in season 1971–72, a record that is particularly impressive because unlike other top-flight national leagues, the Bundesliga only has 18 teams and therefore only 34 games per season. Müller averaged a goal per game or better in seven of his 14 seasons. He scored 68 goals in 62 German international games. He held the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, striking 85 goals in 1972, until his total was surpassed 40 years later in 2012 by Lionel Messi.\n\nAfter his career in the Bundesliga he went to the United States, where he joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1979. He played three seasons with this team, scoring 38 goals, and reaching, but losing, the league final in 1980. He was a 2nd-team NASL All Star in 1979.\n\nMüller scored 68 goals in 62 games for West Germany. He was Germany's all-time leading scorer for almost 40 years until surpassed by Miroslav Klose in 2014, though Klose required more than double the number of caps to do so, scoring his 69th goal in his 132nd appearance. Müller's international career started in 1966 and ended on 7 July 1974 with victory at the 1974 World Cup at his home stadium in Munich. He scored the winning goal for the 2–1 victory over Johan Cruyff's Netherlands in the final. His four goals in that tournament and his ten goals at the 1970 World Cup combined made him the all-time highest World Cup goalscorer at the time with 14 goals. His record stood until the 2006 tournament, coincidentally held in Germany, when it was broken by Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who also required more matches than Müller to achieve his tally. Müller also participated in the 1972 European Championship, becoming top scorer with four goals (including two in the final) and winning the Championship with the West German team.\n\nAfter Müller ended his career in 1982, he fell into a slump and suffered from alcoholism. However, his former companions at Bayern Munich convinced him to go through alcohol rehabilitation. When he emerged, they gave him a job as a coach at Bayern Munich II. There is also a collection of apparel released by sporting giants Adidas under the Gerd Müller name. It is part of the Adidas originals series. In July 2008, the Rieser Sportpark, in Nördlingen, where Müller had begun his career, was renamed the Gerd-Müller-Stadion in his honour.\n\nIn October 2015, it was announced that Müller is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn his book, \"\", author David Winner writes, \"Müller was short, squat, awkward-looking and not notably fast; he never fitted the conventional idea of a great footballer, but he had lethal acceleration over short distances, a remarkable aerial game, and uncanny goalscoring instincts. His short legs gave him a strangely low center of gravity, so he could turn quickly and with perfect balance in spaces and at speeds that would cause other players to fall over. He also had a knack of scoring in unlikely situations.\"\n\nThe impression that Gerd Müller was not very fast may stem from his short appearance. He did not run very much, but this is rather typical of people with fast-twitch muscle fibers – they rely on short bursts of speed. Speed and agility were always Gerd Müller's greatest assets – and this enabled him to reach an extreme acceleration and be first to the ball. He also regularly soared higher than much taller defenders while jumping for the ball. His team mate Franz Beckenbauer has emphasized Müller's unusual speed: \"His pace was incredible. In training I have played against him and I never had a chance.\"\n\nA goals tally in bold indicates that Müller was the competition's top scorer for that season.\n\nMüller scored 68 goals in 62 games for West Germany. His 14 goals in FIFA World Cup tournaments were a record between 1974 and 2006. This score was bettered in 2006 by Brazil's Ronaldo, and eight years later by German Miroslav Klose, who also broke Müller's record for goals for Germany.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He resides in South Beach (Miami Beach, Florida) and Park City, Utah.\n\nPrewitt competes in professional and occasionally amateur motorsport road races and has driven in nearly 200 endurance racing or sprint races worldwide. He was the #1 American and finished 4th of 819 international drivers from 58 countries in the 2015 International Endurance Series Championship. He has been a competitor in the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series and at international FIA races including 24 Hours of Daytona, 24 Hours Nürburgring, Dubai 24 Hour, 24 Hours of Barcelona and Silverstone Britcar 24-Hour.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s he was one of the early creators of personal computer products, developing popular software and hardware while helping build a new industry. He provided consulting services to IBM and is credited with inventing hard disk drives and world's first local area network (LAN) for their first portable computer, the IBM 5100, and their first desktop computer the IBM 5120.\n\nHe created the technology and trademarked Hotplug the computer's industries standard method of replacing computer system components without the need for stopping or shutting down key parts such as disk drives, disk controller or host adapter and power supplies. Prewitt's first patent details were disclosed in 1987 in USA and Europe related to development of the technology however the filings were not completed. The trademark was issued by the USPTO and other countries in 1992 under \"Computer & Software Products & Electrical & Scientific Products Trademarks\".\n\nSkilled in computer programming and engineering, Prewitt founded and managed a number of technology firms. The largest and best known was Core International, a developer of disk array, computer data storage and backup products. Core created and in 1990 marketed the world's first disk drives, disk controller or host adapter and power supplies that were hot pluggable or swappable. Prewitt was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until 1993 when the company was sold to Sony.\n\nPrewitt is the Managing Member of Prewitt Enterprises, a Florida-based agricultural and investment business.\n\nPrewitt grew up in the Daytona Beach, Florida area and lived there from 1963 to 1976. There he had his first exposure to auto racing; volunteering at Daytona International Speedway. He built his first computer in 1967 at 13. It performed simple math, which he disliked so much in school, and operated his phonograph. He joined the Civil Air Patrol as a cadet and earned his way to the second highest rank (Cadet Lt. Colonel), learning leadership, search and rescue, about the military and the value of providing community service. Prewitt learned how to fly a plane, soloed at 16 and shortly thereafter earned his Private Pilots License at the youngest age allowed.\n\nAs a teenager, Prewitt learned sailing, fishing, boating and scuba diving and developed skills in mechanics, engineering, electronics, navigation and construction. After school and in summers, he worked at jobs building homes and in a restaurant washing dishes and cooking. In high school, he rented out the family houseboat. He was interested in painting and photography – he produced and sold a number of images.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Prewitt continued building boats, managing his business and began to focus on computer programming. Between 1972-1975 he learned various programming languages using an IBM 1130. In the early 1970s, Prewitt dreamed of designing, building and selling a generation of small business computers with a price tag much less than the going rate of $50,000. Convinced that there was a market, Prewitt unsuccessfully sought venture capital to get his plans off the ground. In 1975, he built an Altair 8800. That same year, at the age of 21, Prewitt obtained his first business applications customer when he sold, designed and wrote computer programs for the IBM 5100 and System/32 as part of the business he had started at age 16. He joined the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) and participated in autocross events.\n\nPrewitt was born in Hutchinson, Kansas. Prewitt's father joined the US Air Force underage at 13 years old using his older brother's ID and then switched to the US Navy at 17 serving in World War II and Korea. His father left the military after 18 years (1945–62), did odd jobs and then worked as a mailman for the US Postal Service until his death. Prewitt's father was honored as a Kentucky Colonel by the Governor of Kentucky. His mother was a Registered nurse and lives in the Daytona Beach, Florida area.\n\nPrewitt married his first wife Florine Andrews in August 1980 and divorced after 23 years in early 2004. They have two sons, Calvin and Tim. He married Corinne Brody (Loria) in October 2007. She has a son, Alex.\n\nPrewitt attended All Souls Catholic School (1960–63) in Sanford, Florida until 3rd grade while his father served in the military. He attended Port Orange Elementary School (1963–65) from 3rd to 5th grade when his family moved to Allandale, Florida. In 1966, his family moved to Ormond Beach, Florida where he attended Osceola Elementary (1965–66), Seabreeze Jr. High (1966–69) and then graduated from Seabreeze High School (1969–72). At 16, he attended Burnside-Ott Aviation in Miami, Florida where he soloed. After high school, Prewitt attended Daytona Beach Community College (1972–76) studying business and computer science but left without earning a degree. He transferred to Florida Atlantic University (1976–78), Boca Raton, Florida where he continued his studies in business and computer science. Prewitt dropped out of college to focus on his business.\n\nPrewitt's working career began at the age of 13. He started in construction helping build homes for an Ormond Beach, Florida builder. He also worked busing tables and washing dishes before a promotion to cook at a couple of local restaurants. At 16, Prewitt started his first business. While attending community college, he built boats, worked as a painter, an accountant and for the yard crew at the Howard Boat Works marina. Prewitt's final jobs where he was employed by someone else were as a lab assistant helping students in his college and as a computer programmer for a company providing business applications on mainframes and mini computers.\n\nPrewitt started his first business when he was 16 and a junior in High School. \"Ranger Systems\", had four divisions: Ranger Manufacturing, Business World, Rent a Houseboat and Ranger Automotive Engineering.\n\nHe used the manufacturing part of the business to build electronics, computers and fiberglass boats from 13' fishing runabouts to a 40' houseboat. Business World did marketing, photography, printing and advertising. Prewitt wrote brochures, shot pictures, placed ads and ran a printing press. The biggest and most profitable division was Rent a Houseboat. Prewitt took the family boat and turned it into a rental business. He sometimes used a small boat to travel to school and quickly reach the houseboat. Prewitt did everything from writing contracts to maintenance. Prewitt frequently missed classes to unstop a toilet or revive the boat engine. The automotive division focused on repairs.\n\nPrewitt operated Ranger Systems from 1970 to 1975 until his focus switched to computer programming and the personal computer industry.\n\nIn 1975, Prewitt created International Computer to continue building, selling, installing and programming computers. This was the period when he started developing storage devices which ultimately became his most successful products. He had customers that were located from mid to south Florida in manufacturing, hotel, service, legal, medical, construction and agricultural industries. Prewitt flew to their offices by initially renting aircraft and then by using his own.\nPrewitt started Southeast Computer Consultants with a partner in late 1977.\n\nIn late 1979, Prewitt as sole owner created Core International from the assets of International Computer and Southeast Computer Consultants. Initially Core was created as a for-profit association of owners and operators of small IBM computers. It sold mail-order computer supplies and developed software for users of the IBM 5100, 5110 and IBM 5120 systems.\n\nPrewitt built his first computer storage product for the IBM 5100 series because the machines did not have hard disk drives. Prewitt contracted with Control Data Corporation to manufacture the key component. Even though it was a niche product, the product became popular almost overnight when IBM discontinued its 5100 series and their customers turned to Core for parts and supplies. Within two years, Prewitt had sold $2.5 million worth of disk drives.\n\nCore's second hardware and major software product also catered to the IBM orphans, a device and software that allowed IBM 5110/20 users to transfer data and programs from old bulky computers into new personal computers, which in 1981 were revolutionizing the computer industry. Core's software was called PC51 and allowed any DOS personal computer to use, unmodified, any BASIC program written for the IBM 5110/20 series computer. IBM consequently approached Core to become an IBM dealer. Customers could buy an integrated IBM PC, which completely replaced IBM's 5100 computers, or optionally attach their 5100 to Core's local area network, connecting all machines. These were revolutionary products and Core was the only source.\n\nThe company expanded internationally to include offices in Europe and Asia. In 1986, \"Inc Magazine\" selected Core as 21st in their annual list (Inc. 500) of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the U.S.. By 1990, Core was well known as an industry leading developer of disk array, computer data storage and backup products. COREtest became the industry standard and most often quoted benchmark used to test, evaluate and compare performance of hard disk drives.\n\nMany of Prewitt's products were the first of their kind, had no direct competition and were widely regarded for their superior performance and reliability. He was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Core until 1993 when the company was sold to Sony.\n\nPrewitt is the Managing Member of Prewitt Enterprises, a Florida-based agricultural and investment business with offices in Boca Raton and Miami, Florida, and in Park City, Utah. The agricultural part of the business grows oranges and at its peak produced more than 1.5 million half gallon cartons of orange juice per year with much of it used in Tropicana's Pure Premium. The investment division is active in private and public businesses in both the U.S. and internationally.\n\nPrewitt is the Managing Member of Prewitt Management, a Florida-based fine-art photography business with offices in Boca Raton, Florida; Miami, Florida and Park City, Utah. Prewitt's photography is often of nature and panoramic landscapes.\n\nPrewitt first became active in racing while growing up in Daytona Beach, Florida in the 1970s and driving in SCCA events. He became serious in 2004 after attending Skip Barber Racing School.\nToday, Prewitt is a professional level driver in selected International and North American Endurance road race events supporting his sponsors and EveryLapCounts.com, a global fund raising effort for children's charitable causes. He enjoys Endurance rather than Sprint racing.\n\nFinished as the #1 American and 4th out of 819 international drivers from 58 countries in the 2015 International Endurance Series Championship. As of June 2015, Prewitt qualified for a career total 194 races (140 Sprint and 54 Endurance) and drove in 29 endurance (24 hours or longer) events at 33 tracks. He has won 73 firsts, 30 seconds and 10 third places for 41% wins in 180 starts and for 63% podium finishes. He has a low 3.61% did not finish (DNF) incident rate.\n\nFor the last 5 years he has mostly driven for Cor Euser Racing in a BMW 120d, BMW M3 and Lotus Evora.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Prewitt won numerous 1st place and class wins while racing in Historic Sportscar Racing (HSR), Rolex Endurance Series and the Historic GT Series. He won the 2006 National Auto Sport Association (NASA) National Championship at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course while driving the Porsche 911 GT3 RS that won 2nd place in class for the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, he captured numerous lap records in SCCA, PBOC Motorsports Club and National Auto Sport Association (NASA) classes and was overall winner in the PBOC 2005 and 2006 Race Series season.\n\nPrewitt is a sport fisherman. Over the years, he has caught and released more than one thousand Billfish with many of them tagged for science research. Most of these were captured \"stand up\", not using a fishing chair and on light tackle. Prewitt was selected as Atlantic Ocean Angler of the Year 1992, recognized and awarded by International Game Fish Association (IGFA) as the angler who Tagged & Released the most Sailfish in 1990, 1991 and 1992 and White Marlin in 1992. In 1989, \"Power and Motoryacht Magazine\" named him one of America's Top Ten Anglers of 1988.\n\nIn 1988, he won the Bahamas Billfish Championship (BBC). This annual award recognizes the overall champion of six tournaments located in the Bahamas held on Bimini, Cat Cay, Walker's Cay, Berry Islands and the Abacos.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, Prewitt served as a Commissioner on the Architectural and Code Enforcement Boards prior to his 2001 unopposed election to the Town Commission of Manalapan, Florida where he held office until the town was reapportioned in 2002. Prewitt served on the Florida Atlantic University Executive Advisory Board and Palm Beach Countywide Beaches & Shores Council.\n\nPrewitt is dyslexic, thus has difficulty reading and spelling.\n\nIn March 2009, Prewitt bought a house in Park City, Utah, that had belonged to Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney since 1999.\n\nPrewitt's wife, Corinne, is a graduate of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and was an Assistant County Manager for the $7 billion Miami-Dade County government, overseeing strategic planning, human resources, and technology initiatives.\n\n"}
{"id": "43989664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43989664", "title": "Heinrich Pommerenke", "text": "Heinrich Pommerenke\n\nHeinrich Max Pommerenke (born July 6, 1937 in Bentwisch – December 27, 2008 in Asperg) was a German serial killer. Detained since 1959, he was the longest-serving prisoner in the Germany until at the time of his death.\n\nPommerenke came from Bentwisch, Mecklenburg, where his father worked at the Rostock Port. His father died during the War and his mother left her two children after the war in 1949 and moved to Switzerland, and from then on Pommerenke lived with his grandparents in Mecklenburg. When he was still a student, he committed his first rape. After completing a painting apprenticeship and another rape, Pommerenke fled East Germany for West Berlin in 1953. There he was picked up by authorities, whom contacted his mother. He was then sent to live with his mother in Zürich. His sister, who had been in a children's home for three years, had already been able to move there a year before. Pommerenke found work at a fair in Schaffhausen, but when he was again accused of rape, he was expelled from Switzerland and prevented from entering the country for ten years. Other offenses such as robberies and moral crimes were committed during this time in southern Germany and the Austrian city of Bregenz.\n\nWith a dense series of murders and attempted murders, Pommerenke struck fear and terror in the Black Forest area. He showed a certain affinity to trains, stations and railway enbankments, but without a single modus operandi, his actions could not be assigned to him until his arrest. Pommerenke lived in Hornberg at the time.\n\nAccording to Pommerenke's later confessions, his murderous spree was triggered when he a film screening of \"The Ten Commandments\" by Cecil B. DeMille in a movie theater in Karlsruhe. After the presenation of the golden calf by slightly clothed women, he had come to the conclusion that all women are the root of evil and that it was his mission to punish them.\n\nThat same evening he committed the first murder in a park near the cinema. The body, who was raped and whose throat was slit, was that of 49-year-old Hilde Konter, found on February 26, 1959 at the motorway junction in Durlach.\n\nIn March 1959, Pommerenke abused 18-year-old Karin Wälde in a wooden hut on the outskirts of Hornberg, killing the young woman with a stone and throwing her body across the river enbankment at the nearby railway embankment; her body was discovered on March 25, 1959 on the banks of the Gutach.\n\nOn May 30, 1959, in Singen, Pommerenke penetrated through the window of a 18-year-old store clerk in her parents' house and attempted to strangle her; however, the victim was able to free herself and call for help, whereupon Pommerenke fled. The woman was able to give the police the following day an exact description of the person, but he was not associated with the previous two murders.\n\nOn May 31, 1959, shortly before midnight at the main railway station in Heidelberg, Pommerenke boarded the tourist special train D 969 to Finale Ligure on the Italian Riviera. In the train he murdered 21-year-old Dagmar Klimek with a knife stab to the chest, threw her body on the Rhine Valley Railway towards Basel just behind Freiburg im Breisgau near the Ebringen breakpoint from the train, then pressed the emergency brake, so that the train two miles further south of Schallstadt could come to a standstill. Pommerenke got out of his bed, returned to the corpse and dragged it to a nearby dirt road, where he committed sexual acts on it. Dagmar Klimek was reported by her friends as missing the following day when the train reached the Swiss Bellinzona; a connection with the emergency brake at Schallstadt, in which two witnesses saw a figure climbing out of the train, was not made. On June 5, 1959, Klimek's body was found at the embankment near Ebringen; the forensic examination revealed that the cause of death was a stab wound, while the other injuries as a result from the fall from the train were non-fatal. The investigations of the Freiburg police were initially in the sand, also because the car in question, which was transferred with the help of the Federal Criminal Police Office after a few days to Freiburg, had been repeatedly cleaned several times, so that no usable traces could be secured. There was no concrete evidence from the survey carried out on co-travelers at their holiday destinations in Italy, which involved a lot of travel.\n\nOn June 2, before the Klimek murder became known, Pommerenke attacked a 25-year-old waitress near the Triberg im Schwarzwald train station, beating her down with an ironed wood and robbing her purse.\n\nOn June 6, while cycling around in Karlsruhe, Pommerenke injured two women severely by stabbing them in the necks.\n\nOn June 8, Pommerenke broke into the room of a 15-year-old girl through an open window and severely injured her by stabbing her in the neck, but was put to flight by her father, who had come to her aid. The police were able to secure a sole imprint of the offender at the scene.\n\nOn June 9, Pommerenke raped and strangled 16-year-old Rita Walterspacher near Baden-Baden, dumping her body in a nearby wooded area where she as found the following day. Again, the investigators lacked, as in the previous murders, any leads.\n\nOn June 10, Pommerenke stole a small caliber rifle and an air-pressure pistol during a break-in in a weapons shop in Baden-Baden. With this pistol he invaded on June 18 a ticket office at Durlach station, seizing 540 Deutsche Mark and escaping unrecognized. On the same day he picked up a suit from a tailor in Hornberg, ordering it under his own name. He next left his own worn-out clothes and a package back in which was the small-caliber rifle which he wanted to use in a few days.\n\nA footprint was secured at the scene in Durlach station, which corresponded to the track secured on June 8, and the description provided to police with the first evidence of a connection between the burglary and the murders. On June 19, a man named Schneider from Hornberg reported that he had found a small-caliber rifle and provided personal data of the perpetrator; the same day Pommerenke was recognized in Hornberg and was finally arrested on the station's forecourt.\n\nIn the course of the ensuing interrogations, Pommerenke admitted to a total of 65 offenses, including the four murders, seven attempted murders, two rapes and 25 attempted rapes, six robberies, ten burglaries and six thefts.\n\nPommerenke's trial began on October 3, 1960 before the district court of Freiburg im Breisgau. Of the offenses confessed by him, 38 were not prosecuted, since at the time he had not reached the age of 21. The appraisers Hans Ruffin and Christoph Staewen declared the defendant guilty. On October 22, he was sentenced to life imprisonment six times and another 15 (from single sentences 165) years in prison; it was the most severe sentence of a West German court of the post-war period.\n\nFrom 1960 Pommerenke was imprisoned in the Bruchsal prison; suspecion of the sentence was repeatedly denied on the grounds that he continued to be a high-security risk.\n\nAt the end of 2006, Pommerenke was transferred to Hohenasperg, where the central hospital of Baden-Württemberg prison was located, where he would undergo social therapy. The therapy, however, was canceled after a year, since Pommerenke was moved the Heilbronn prison.\n\nOn December 27, 2008, Pommerenke died due to leukemia in Hohenasperg, at the age of 71. The body was cremated and the ashes scattered at sea. He was, until his death, Germany's longest-serving prisoner. In this regard, he has since been replaced by Hans-Georg Neumann.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41883840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41883840", "title": "Ioan A. Bassarabescu", "text": "Ioan A. Bassarabescu\n\nIoan Alecu Bassarabescu (commonly rendered I. A. Bassarabescu; December 17, 1870 - March 27, 1952) was a Romanian comedic writer, civil servant and politician, who served one term (1926-1927) in the Senate of Romania. His work, mainly in prose form, is remembered as an accomplished and noteworthy contribution to Romanian literature, capturing the dreary life of provincial clerks in the early 20th century. Not interested in producing a singular novel, like his mentor Gustave Flaubert, he concentrated instead on the sketch story genre.\n\nIn his debut stage, Bassarabescu belonged to \"Junimea\", the mainly literary and politically conservative club. He was friends with Titu Maiorescu, \"Junimea\" leader, and with the \"Junimist\" author Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești (with whom he is often compared). Married into a political family, Bassarabescu had joined the Conservative Party by 1906, and, although still mainly active as a teacher, received high appointments in the bureaucracy.\n\nDuring World War I, Bassarabescu he supported the Central Powers and was even appointed Prefect of Prahova County under a German-led occupation. This put his political career on hold until 1925, when he joined the People's Party. Moving into right-wing populism in the 1930s, Bassarabescu had stints in the National Agrarian Party and the National Christian Party, and joined the official National Renaissance Front in 1939. His last years were spent in seclusion: losing his fortune to Allied carpet bombing, stripped of his Romanian Academy membership by the communist regime, he died suddenly in a road accident.\n\nBassarabescu descended from \"boyar\" families that occupied court positions in Wallachia: his father, Alecu, was a \"pitar\"; his mother, Elisa, was the daughter of a \"staroste\", relatives with General Romulus Boteanu. Alecu had received a progressive education at the Saint Sava Academy; his colleagues there later instigated the 1848 Revolution in Wallachia. Although he had settled in the Danube port of Giurgiu, his own family was more closely associated with Bucharest, the national capital. Noted members of this branch include Nicolae \"Nae\" Bassarabescu, who worked as a journalist in the liberal-radical press, later setting up the first newsstand chain in town, and composer George Bassarabescu.\n\nOne of the couple's seven children, Ioan Alecu was born in Giurgiu, an ethnic Romanian baptized into the Romanian Orthodox Church. In 1877, the family left the city because of Ottoman bombardments during the Romanian War of Independence, settling in Bucharest. The eight-year-old Bassarabescu was first enlisted at school in Bucharest's Yellow Ward, and later in the Green Ward.\n\nEnrolled at Saint Sava National College, Bassarabescu was classmates with various intellectual luminaries and political figures of his generation, among them Constantin Banu, Ion Livescu and Scarlat Orăscu. Influenced by their teacher, classical scholar Anghel Demetriescu, they formed their own literary club, which held its meetings in the Saint Sava basement. Together, they put out the makeshift literary review \"Armonia\", described by an aging Bassarabescu as polygraphed \"with the faintest and least readable violet letters to have ever been used for writing in this world.\" It was soon replaced by a less makeshift periodical, the bi-monthly \"Studentul Român\". Bassarabescu published his first short stories in that paper, and then in the youth review \"Generația Viitoare\", before being hosted (with words of praise and encouragement) by the literary supplement of \"Românul\" newspaper.\n\n\"Studentul Român\" only put out three issues, closing down due to a \"lack of funds\", but not, as Bassarabescu quipped, to a \"lack of scientific and literary contributions\". By this time, the Saint Sava pupils began attending literary- and social-themed conferences at the Romanian Atheneum. It was there that Bassarabescu met the successful writer Alexandru Vlahuță, who gave him some of his first literary pointers. Soon, Bassarabescu's pieces were hosted by \"Revista Nouă\", a literary journal managed by Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu (1893). This was an impressive feat, to judge by Bassarabescu's own words: \"imposingly grand\" and \"too expensive\" venture, \"Revista Nouă\" had fascinated him and his Saint Sava colleagues. He also dabbled in parodic poetry, some of which was published by the Symbolist review, \"Literatorul\".\n\nBy 1896, after such permutations, Bassarabescu was firmly affiliated with \"Junimea\", contributing to the \"Junimist\" tribune, \"Convorbiri Literare\", and cultivating a friendship with its founder, Titu Maiorescu. Like his generational colleague Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești, Bassarabescu joined in just as the \"Convorbiri Literare\", for long disregarded by Maiorescu, was entering its decline stage. As noted by literary historian Zigu Ornea, the stories of Bassarabescu and Brătescu-Voinești were a rare diversion, the magazine having grown \"monotonous\", \"suffocated by bulky specialized studies\". Bassarabescu was not dissuaded by such problems: he would contribute to the magazine throughout most of his life. He managed to impress a wide range of professionals, from the \"Junimist\" novelist Duiliu Zamfirescu (who guessed in him a future \"great writer\") to the independent Ilarie Chendi.\n\nBetween his move from \"Revista Nouă\" to \"Junimea\", Bassarabescu had enlisted at the Literature and Philosophy Faculty of the University of Bucharest (graduated 1897), while also working as a Finance Ministry clerk. At around that time, he had moved to Ploiești city, Prahova, where he would live for most of his life, and became a teacher of geography and French. Various sources have it that his relocation occurred in 1896 or 1897, but, according to literary historian George Călinescu, Bassarabescu had spent 1898 working as a substitute teacher in Focșani. Around that moment, his work appeared in the review \"Noutatea\", put out in Iași by Berman Goldner-Giordano.\n\nIn January 1900, with the start of a new \"Convorbiri Literare\" series, Bassarabescu was co-opted onto the journal's editorial committee, overseen by geographer Grigore Antipa. According to Ornea, the panel membership evidenced in itself that political \"Junimism\" had mutated into eclecticism: Antipa was a National Liberal, and one regular member, Dimitrie Voinov, a socialist. Like other \"Convorbiri Literare\" contributors, Bassarabescu saw his work published in the more radical right-wing \"Sămănătorul\" magazine, but he did not necessarily identify with the \"Sămănătorul\" agenda. He was invited to publish there by his mentor Vlahuță, who rewarded his contribution with an original canvas by painter Nicolae Grigorescu. In 1903, he answered a similar call from Livescu, publishing in the new magazine \"Revista Teatrelor\".\n\nPolitically, he leaned toward the mainstream Conservative Party, which had Maiorescu as chief doctrinaire. It is probable that Bassarabescu began frequenting the Ploiești Conservative chapter in or around 1901, making friends with political boss Temelie Dinescu, and courting his intellectual daughter, Ecaterina Dinescu. From about 1906, he registered formally with the Conservative Party.\n\nIn April 1904, Bassarabescu married Ecaterina Dinescu. The modest ceremony was compensated by a sizable dowry (including a family home on R. Stanian Street) and a honeymoon in Venice. Temelie Dinescu died just four months after the event, leaving them ownership of another home, located on a street that was named in his honor. Some time after, Ecaterina gave birth to a daughter, Maria-Elisabeta (whom both parents nicknamed \"Cireșica\", \"Little Cherry\").\n\nThe first bound collection of Bassarabescu's novellas and stories was released (as \"Nuvele\") in 1903, with Editura Socec. In 1907, Editura Minerva and \"Biblioteca pentru toți\" published two other selections, \"Vulturii\" (\"The Eagles\") and \"Norocul\" (\"Luck\"). With Mihail Sadoveanu, A. de Herz, Emil Gârleanu, George Ranetti and some others, he was employed by the National Theater Bucharest to work on professional translations of comedy and drama. As Livescu recounts, this was a project heralded by manager Pompiliu Eliade, who had recently been \"appalled\" by the poor-quality translations already in circulation. Bassarabescu was assigned to work on comedies by Georges Courteline, and, Livescu argues, did an \"excellent\" job. In 1908, Socec published his adaptation of a 15th-century farce, \"Master Pierre Pathelin\" (as \"Ovidiu Șicană\"). His wife also wrote poetry and prose, published in reviews such as \"Luceafărul\", \"Convorbiri Critice\" or \"Epoca\", usually under the pen name of \"Irena Mohor\".\n\nDuring those years, the Bassarabescu family played host to a long succession of writers visiting Ploiești. Bassarabescu became rather close friends with two senior figures on the cultural scene: the Ploiești literary theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and satirist Ion Luca Caragiale. In March 1908, Bassarabescu affiliated with the prototype Romanian Writers' Society, and was elected a member of its steering committee. As such, he had a say in the scandal during which the Society, which was Christian-only, moved to reprimand a Jewish Romanian writer, Eugen Porn, and was in turn accused of antisemitism. Bassarabescu took a partisan position, acknowledging that some of Porn's concerns were valid, but concluding that Porn was rather the anti-Romanian.\n\nA Freemason, he was proposed for membership in the Romanian Academy by Duiliu Zamfirescu and seconded by Maiorescu, themselves Freemasons. He was elected a corresponding member on March 25, 1909. Also in 1909, Socec published another selection of his writings, \"Noi și vechi\" (\"New Ones and Old Ones\"). Some two years later, Bassarabescu received high appointment in the Education Ministry, as Inspector for the Arts for Minister Constantin C. Arion. In 1912, he was commissioned as Inspector-General for Education.\n\nThe onset of World War I marked a turn in Bassarabescu's life. During Romania's neutrality years (1914-1916), he adapted himself to the Germanophile sentiments of his \"Junimist\" and Conservative peers. He gave lectures at the Bucharest Conservative Club, on topics such as \"Realpolitik\" and the British Empire. He also joined \"Junimea\" geographer Simion Mehedinți in putting out \"Dumineca Poporului\" review, but contributed his trademark satirical pieces, rather than political articles. Such works were grouped in the 1916 volume \"Nenea\" (\"Old Chap\"), published with Alcaly.\n\nEventually, Ferdinand I of Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary, the German Empire and the other Central Powers. It came as a shock for the Germanophiles. Although subject to the Romanian Army draft, Bassarabescu managed to avoid being called into active duty, and was instead appointed captain of a military reserve in Mogoșoaia train station. Through their personal contacts, both Mehedinți and Maiorescu tried to get Bassarabescu appointed to an even safer position, at a postal censorship bureau.\n\nIn the second half of 1916, the Central Powers broke through Romania's line of defenses, forcing the government and the Army to withdraw northeast, into Moldavia; Bucharest was abandoned. In these circumstances, Bassarabescu checked himself into a Bucharest hospital, claiming that he suffered from a \"severe cold\". This allowed him to stay in German-occupied territory, and, in the Romanian loyalist ranks, labeled him a probable deserter. As historian Lucian Boia notes, the suspicion is still standing: an entry in Maiorescu's diary shows that Bassarabescu had left the hospital on at least one occasion during the interval of his supposed illness.\n\nIn the wake of the Battle of Bucharest, Bassarabescu was held in captivity and processed by the German Army. Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, a \"Junimist\" in the German ranks, intervened for his release, and then employed him at the Bucharest Police Prefecture — Bassarabescu served there as Divisional Chief from February to April 1917. The Germans then forced Bassarabescu back to his adoptive Ploiești and to his schoolteacher's career. According to writer Victor Eftimiu, who knew and befriended Bassarabescu, this assignment suited him perfectly: \"Himself a shy man [like his characters,] he was content with sticking to his provincial schoolteacher's job.\"\n\nA year later, with peace negotiations under way between the Central Powers and Romania, Bassarabescu was reintegrated into the civil service by the emergency cabinet of Alexandru Marghiloman, a Germanophile Conservative. On May 7, 1918, he was made Prefect of Prahova County. He lasted there for a full nine months, earning respect from the populace and defending its interests in disputes with the German occupiers.\n\nThe Armistice with Germany on the Western Front revolutionized Romania's positioning and brought Marghiloman's administration to a standstill. On the very day of the Armistice, Bassarabescu handed in his resignation. The loyalist regime which took over suspended Bassarabescu from his teaching post, and subjected him to a military inquiry. He was eventually cleared, even praised for his efforts as Prefect, and allowed to resume his work in education. He also resumed his literary activity, which resulted in the 1919 volume \"Un dor împlinit\" (\"A Satisfied Longing\", Steinberg Publishers), followed in 1923 by another Socec edition of \"Nuvele\" and \"Moș Stan\" (\"Old Man Stan\", Editura Cultura Națională). In 1923, he joined the Writers' Society literary tour of Transylvania, sharing the stage with Eugeniu Botez, Al. T. Stamatiad, Ion Minulescu and others.\n\nThroughout the war and down to Marghiloman's death, Bassarabescu held on to the presidency of a declining Prahova Conservative chapter. The whole party, now redesigned into a \"Conservative-Progressive\" group, was becoming numerically insignificant. According to Bassarabescu's own claim, this was because, in post-war Greater Romania, \"mediocrity\", \"obscurantism\" and \"fishing in murky waters\" had become the standard of political life. Marghiloman, he argued, was a \"sailor\" in an age that preferred \"corsairs\". In the mid-1920s, Bassarabescu himself abandoned the Conservative-Progressives, and made a successful return to national politics. He joined the People's Party (PP) of Alexandru Averescu. In exchange, he was made Vice President of the PP section in Prahova and, following the June 1926 election, a Senator for that county.\n\nIn office only until the 1927 recall, he worked on the short story selections \"Un om în toată firea\" (\"A Fully Grown Man\"), published that year with Socec, and \"Domnu Dincă\" (\"Mister Dincă\"), which came out, in 1928, at Casa Școalelor. Two more small volumes of his works were published in the Cartea Românească digest: \"Spre Slatina\" (\"Onwards to Slatina\"), then \"Pe drezină\" (\"On the Draisine\"). In 1930, the Grand Orient of Romania elected Bassarabescu one of its Masonic Lodge Officers—demoted to honorary member in 1933, and affiliated with the regional \"Libertatea\" Lodge in 1937. There was also a proposal to make him a full member of the Romanian Academy, where, in 1928, he was giving a formal speech narrating \"two epochs in Romanian literature\". According to his own recollections, although he passed one round of voting, he was eventually sidelined and another candidate took the seat (1931).\n\nIn 1932, the PP split between a conservative group, headed by Averescu, and a radical one, led by Octavian Goga. Bassarabescu sided with the latter, leaving the PP to join Goga's National Agrarian Party (PNA). This was a problematic political move: the PNA was firmly planted on the antisemitic right-wing, albeit its prejudice was mild enough to even allow some Jews into party ranks. At the time, his more virulently antisemitic colleague, Brătescu-Voinești, was gathering support for purging the literary world of what he called \"abject\" Jewish influences. Bassarabescu occasionally joined in, such as when he cosigned Brătescu's letter to novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, an ambiguous document which implied that Sadoveanu had given in to such Jewish influences.\n\nThree years later, Bassarabescu followed the National Agrarians into their merger with the National-Christian Defense League, and became a member of the resulting National Christian Party (PNC). This was a more evidently antisemitic organization, unwelcoming of all Jewish PNA members, and publishing open statements against \"the kikes\". As noted by Bassarabescu himself, he was still a PNC member in May 1938, \"upon the chief's [Goga's] death\". His literary work at the time was an anthology of Romanian literature, edited in collaboration with Petre Haneș (published 1937). In 1935, \"Convorbiri Literare\", in the process of recovering unknown writings by the late Maiorescu, also published four letters that Maiorescu had sent to Bassarabescu decades before.\n\nBassarabescu benefited from the rise of an authoritarian single-party regime during the early month of World War II. He made a publicized bid to join the National Renaissance Front, and was accepted into its ranks on Christmas Day, 1939. In 1940, Casa Școalelor put out his \"Opere complete\" (\"Complete Works\"). As a guest of the Romanian Atheneum, Bassarabescu introduced the public to the largely forgotten work of a 19th-century female writer, Sofia Cocea.\n\nHe was by then a highly decorated member of the establishment: a recipient of the Order of the Crown (commander), the Order of the Star of Romania (officer) and the Cultural Merit Order (officer). His work focused on recollections from an earlier age, such as a 1942 piece about his youthful encounters with Vlahuță, in \"Gazeta Cărților\", a literary newspaper. In 1943, Editura Cugetarea put on sale his definitive collection of \"Proză\" (\"Prose\"), which included some of his memoirs. As Eftimiu notes, they are self-deriding pieces, acknowledging \"a mediocre destiny\".\n\nThe Bassarabescu family fortunes turned during the carpet bombing campaign of 1944. While the Bassarabescus fled for their safety to nearby Slănic, their Stanian Street lodging was destroyed; they moved to their Dinescu Street residence. Upon war's end, Bassarabescu was also targeted for political retaliation. In 1948, the new communist regime stripped Bassarabescu and 112 others of their Academy membership.\n\nThe same year, Ecaterina Bassarabescu died, leaving Ioan Alecu to be cared for by daughter Maria-Elisabeta. The latter was a career woman, who had graduated law school and was among the first Romanian female judges. On March 27, 1952, Bassarabescu himself died, the result of a car accident in Ploiești. Although Călinescu and Eftimiu simply note this is a fact, later sources describe the circumstances of this accident as generally suspicious.\n\nIn death, Bassarabescu was recoverable. According to Eftimiu, communism allowed Bassarabescu's work to be published \"in tens of thousands of copies\", \"a circulation that they have never had before.\" The Giurgiu County library in his native city bears his name since 1991.\n\nThe chief sources of inspiration behind Bassarabescu's comedic and realistic style were two \"Junimist\" figures: the Romanian classic Ion Luca Caragiale, and his own friend, Brătescu-Voinești. In their immediate temporal setting, Brătescu-Voinești and Bassarabescu were both influential on other noted, non-\"Junimist\", authors of short prose: Emil Gârleanu and (for a while) Mihail Sadoveanu. Beyond this generation, they also influenced the novels or novellas of Lucia Mantu, Marius \"G. M. Vlădescu\" Mircu and Cezar Petrescu.\n\nThe eye of such writers is firmly focused on a class of individuals, described for instance in Călinescu: \"the isolated folk of provincial boroughs, small-time functionaries of the Romanian Railways, minuscule bourgeois women grinding the great passions of life.\" Contrary to Brătescu-Voinești, he did not depict such men and women as existential losers or \"misfits\", but as entirely content with their mediocrity, their \"terrestrial ideal\": \"these people\", Călinescu writes, \"do not suffer, because they do not aim for, or better said they do not foresee, any existence that would be better than theirs.\" The telegraphist Domițian, protagonist of \"Vulturi\", identifies perfection with a hefty state pension; Mister Guță, of the eponymous story, will only accept the company of women who share his obsession for oleander flowers.\n\nAs another distinguishing feature, Bassarabescu replaces Caragiale's sarcasm with a \"lyrical\", \"tenderly grotesque\", layer, while offering \"the surprise of a humane bedding\" within the provincial soul. His smile, Victor Eftimiu notes, was one \"of compassion\", his gaze \"filtered by tears\", like that of a Romanian Anton Chekhov. Literary critic Eugen Lovinescu finds, in most of Bassarabescu's writings, \"the same family atmosphere with its links of solidarity, with all the hardships of finding their daughters husbands, with sisters that will devour each other out of love, with brothers that will carry on their shoulders the maintenance of their entire household\". This, Lovinescu believes, was the quintessential \"Romanian family\" of the urban milieu, with only a lack of \"fantasy\" and failure at pacing preventing Bassarabescu from producing the great Romanian urban novel. (According to Eftimiu, there is in fact an unpublished Bassarabescu novel, as well as a screenplay.)\n\nBassarabescu's most lyrical pieces may be characterologic studies of sheer timidity, or other debilitating emotions. In writing \"Un om în toată firea\", Bassarabescu shared his own experience as a schoolteacher. He found it impossible to fail a grown man trying to pass his primary school exam, even after discovering that he steals notes from his own daughter. Elsewhere, a luncheon among family and friends end in collective weeping: people at the table morn their very victim, a long-suffering turkey \"with a memorable past\". This \"tenderly grotesque\" particularity came through another major influence on Bassarabescu, which distinguishes him among Caragiale's followers: Gustave Flaubert, whose ironic-but-sympathetic accounts of provincial life are at the source of Bassarabescu's \"Bovaryistic literature\". Such a melange, Călinescu writes, allowed Bassarabescu to cut \"his own profile, with just a minimal literary activity.\" In \"Pe drezină\", possibly his most Bovaryistic story, the female protagonist dreams of escaping her drab marriage (to an obese station master), for just a taste of life in the capital. Her ideal of what that life is largely shaped by her one-time visit to Bucharest's Gara de Nord.\n\nSeveral of Bassarabescu's sketch story works as recognized as tiny masterpieces of the \"still-life\" variety. This means that they suggest a deep layer of meaning just by describing the assortments of a room, or an object apart, without any actual human presence. \"Acasă\" (\"Home\") is a careful inventory of a room seemingly rented by a partying and womanizing officer, including the half-pleading, half-threatening, letter he receives from his desperate supplier of \"colonial goods\". According to Călinescu, such works may even be paralleled to modern art in their studied depiction of \"urban dreariness\". For a relevant case, he cites the sketch story fragment: \"At once, through the beer garden gates, a man showed up carrying with him a giant plank resting on a pole. On this plank, a poster. On the poster, in large handwriting and red paint: 'Gentlemen, today our buffet is serving you vanilla ice cream'.\"\n\n"}

He was the son of Edward Blake and Sarah (Parkman) Blake and nephew of Dr. George Parkman. The Parkmans and Blakes were two prominent families of the Boston Brahmins who were well respected merchants. Blake established himself as a merchant and real estate broker and also served in the Massachusetts Artillery as Major of Independents Cadets beginning in 1830. In 1831, while conducting business aboard the ship \"Mentos\", two pirates boarded the boat where Blake witnessed their arrest. He testified against the pirates in the first of his many court appearances.\n\nOn May 12, 1835, he married Marianne Wildes of Boston and ran his brokerage on State Street. He was appointed City Marshal of Boston on May 1, 1840 at an annual salary of $1,000.00. Blake's term as Marshal was a quiet one and most of his activities involved overseeing July 4 celebrations on the Common, taking a census of buildings, banning illegal hay scales along the wharf, and clearing the streets of snow. He also passed a leash law forbidding large dogs to roam the streets. The most violence he saw was snowball fights, against which he swiftly levied hefty fines. For his due diligence, he received a salary increase of $100 in 1844.\n\nBlake was replaced as Marshal by Ira Gibbons in 1845, and he returned to the more lucrative business of real estate. He opened an office on State Street and later, as his business grew, moved to Congress Street. In 1847, Blake, along with police officer Samuel D. Fuller, helped recover articles stolen from Ebenezer Mann, another merchant. Blake and Officer Fuller would meet again under more serious circumstances.\n\nIn May 1849, the City of Boston was growing weary of their City Marshal, Francis Tukey, and 17 citizens petitioned to have Blake return to fill the post, but Tukey held on. Later that year, Tukey was in the unenviable position of coordinating the investigation into the disappearance of Blake's uncle, Dr. George Parkman.\n\nOn November 23, 1849, Blake's uncle, Dr. George Parkman, never returned home for lunch. The Parkman family asked the doctor's business manager, Charles M. Kinglsey, to search for him, and James and his brother Edward joined the effort. While Edward went to City Marshal Tukey to appeal for police help, James combed the streets of Boston. Tukey sent police officers to drag the river and search the areas the doctor frequented. On November 25, James was standing outside the Harvard Medical College, speaking to police officer Trenholm, when he was approached by one of the professors from the College, John White Webster.John Webster hurriedly approached him, hand outstretched. He was not wearing a coat, even though the weather required it, and it seemed as if he had just come from the College. James was confused as he only had a passing acquaintance with the Professor and yet here was Webster holding his hand while explaining he had a meeting with his uncle on the day he went missing. He never suspected that he was conversing with the man who would later be hanged for Parkman's murder.\n\nAfter this strange encounter, while still searching, James met William V. Thompson, the City Clerk. Thompson told James that he had seen his uncle the afternoon of November 23, just after 2:00 p.m. He also told him he had spoken to Dr. Webster about George Parkman and Webster told him that Parkman was angry and excited regarding Webster's failure to pay on the outstanding debt to him. On November 30, 1849, Parkman's remains were found by the College janitor in Dr. Webster's privy. James requested his own Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles T. Jackson, be present to examine the remains. There was little doubt they had found his uncle.\n\nJames recounted his meeting with Webster in the court trial. At the end of the twelve-day trial, Webster was found guilty. Amid the furor of the verdict, Blake returned to his business.\n\nBlake was involved in other court cases, either as a juror or a plaintiff. Two of his appearances as plaintiff involved the burglary of his clothes. James Henry Blake died on August 1, 1874 in a boating accident in the Boston Harbor.\n\n"}

On March 4, 1976, he posthumously received the Medal of Honor, the United States' highest military award, for his selflessness and courage in the face of lethal danger.\n\nLance Peter Sijan, also known by his Serbian name Lazar Šijan (), was born to Sylvester and Jane Sijan on April 13, 1942, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His father, who owned a restaurant, was an ethnic Serb, his parents emigrated from Serbia during World War I; his mother was an Irish-American. Lance was the eldest of three children. Sijan graduated from Bay View High School in 1960. Immediately after his graduation he attended the Naval Academy Preparatory School at the United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, Maryland. After completion of the program, he gained an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado. He played on the academy's football team for three years, but quit the team in his final year to concentrate on his studies. Graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Humanities in 1965, he was awarded a second lieutenant's commission and began Undergraduate Pilot Training. After its completion, he was assigned to the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 366th Fighter Wing, stationed at Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam. He flew as a pilot and systems officer in an F-4 Phantom.\n\nOn the night of November 9, 1967, for his 52nd combat mission, Sijan and pilot Lt. Col. John Armstrong were tasked with a bombing mission to Ban Laboy ford in Laos. As they rolled in on their target to release their ordnance, their F-4C (AF Ser. No. 64-0751) was engulfed in a ball of fire due to the bomb fuses malfunctioning and causing a premature detonation on their release. Sijan managed to eject from the aircraft, and although likely rendered unconscious in the ejection, his parachute landed him on a rocky limestone karst ridge adjacent to the target.\nFrom the night of 9/10 November to the morning of 11 November, no electronic or radio signals were heard from either Sijan or Armstrong. However, early on the morning of 11 November, Sijan made radio contact with a Misty FAC F-100F aircraft that was flying over his crash site. For the duration of that day, the USAF launched a massive effort to locate his position, and 'soften up' the numerous enemy air defences in his area. At dusk, the SAR forces were finally able to position a CH-3 Jolly Green Giant helicopter near Sijan's position. (During this overall rescue operation, over 20 aircraft were damaged by anti-aircraft fire, and many had to return to base. One A-1H aircraft was shot down, though its pilot was soon rescued by a SAR helicopter on station. Sijan, refusing to put other airmen in danger, insisted on trying to crawl to a jungle penetrator lowered by the helicopter, and he opposed the helicopter's Para-Jumper (PJ) coming down to find and rescue him. Sadly, the helicopter crew could not see him in the heavy jungle, and strangely, they did not deploy the PJ to find and rescue Sijan. After the Jolly Green hovered for 33 minutes, and upon hearing no further radio transmissions from Sijan, the on-scene SAR commander (flying in an A-1H Skyraider aircraft) suspected a trap, and thus ordered the Jolly Green and the entire SAR armada to withdraw. Search efforts continued the very next morning, but they were called off when no further radio contact was made with Sijan. He was then listed in a MIA casualty status.\n\nDuring his violent ejection and very rough parachute landing on the karst ridge, Sijan had suffered a fractured skull, a mangled right hand, and a compound fracture of the left leg. He was without food, with very little water, and no survival kit; nevertheless, he evaded enemy forces for 46 days. During this entire period, Sijan was only able to move by sliding on his buttocks and back along the rocky limestone ridge and later along the jungle floor. After managing to move several thousand feet, Sijan crawled onto a truck road along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, where he was finally captured by the North Vietnamese on Christmas Day, 1967. Very emaciated and in poor health, Sijan was imprisoned in an NVA camp. Soon thereafter, he managed to incapacitate a guard and escape into the jungle, but was recaptured several hours later.\n\nSijan was transported to a holding compound in Vinh, North Vietnam, where he was placed in the care of two other recently captured POWs, Air Force Major Robert R. Craner and Air Force Captain Guy Gruters. Although in terrific pain from his severe wounds and brutal beatings and torture from his captors, Sijan had not disclosed any information other than what the Geneva Convention guidelines allowed (name, date of birth, service, rank, and service number). Suffering terribly from exhaustion, malnutrition, and disease, he was soon transported to Hanoi, under the attentive care of both Craner and Gruters. However, in his weakened state, he contracted pneumonia and died in Hỏa Lò Prison (better known as the \"Hanoi Hilton\") on January 22, 1968.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Sijan was promoted posthumously to captain on June 13, 1968. His remains were repatriated on March 13, 1974, and were positively identified on April 22, 1974. He was buried with military honors in Arlington Park Cemetery in Milwaukee. His former cellmate USAF Colonel Craner recommended him for the Medal Of Honor, with supporting testimony provided by his other fellow cellmate, USAF Captain Gruters. Sijan received the Medal Of Honor posthumously in 1976, with his parents (Sylvester and Jane Sijan) receiving it on his behalf on March 4, 1976, from President Gerald R. Ford.\n\nSijan's military decorations and awards include:\n\nThe President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\nSIJAN, LANCE P.\nRank and organization: Captain, U.S. Air Force, 4th Allied POW Wing, Pilot of an F-4C aircraft.

Sijan ejected from his disabled aircraft and successfully evaded capture for more than 6 weeks. During this time, he was seriously injured and suffered from shock and extreme weight loss due to lack of food. After being captured by North Vietnamese soldiers, Capt. Sijan was taken to a holding point for subsequent transfer to a prisoner of war camp. In his emaciated and crippled condition, he overpowered 1 of his guards and crawled into the jungle, only to be recaptured after several hours. He was then transferred to another prison camp where he was kept in solitary confinement and interrogated at length. During interrogation, he was severely tortured; however, he did not divulge any information to his captors. Capt. Sijan lapsed into delirium and was placed in the care of another prisoner. During his intermittent periods of consciousness until his death, he never complained of his physical condition and, on several occasions, spoke of future escape attempts. Capt. Sijan's extraordinary heroism and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty at the cost of his life are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Armed Forces./S/GERALD R. FORD\nSijan's heroism and courage brought him numerous honors. The United States Air Force created the Lance P. Sijan Award, recognizing individuals who have demonstrated the highest qualities of leadership in their jobs and in their lives. It has become one of the U.S. Air Force's most prestigious awards.\n\nBecause Sijan was the first graduate of the United States Air Force Academy to receive the Medal of Honor, a cadet dormitory, Sijan Hall, was named after him. The dormitory was dedicated on Memorial Day, 1976.\n\nSijan's high school in Milwaukee set up a scholarship in his honor, presented each year to the student who best exemplifies Lance Sijan's examples of leadership and courage.

She is considered as the \"mother of Philippine women's literature\" and the \"bridge from oral to literary tradition\".\n\nBorn to a wealthy and prominent family in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, Florentino began to write her first verses in Ilocano at a young age. Despite her potential, she was not allowed to receive a university education because of her gender. Florentino was instead tutored by her mother, and then a series of private teachers. An educated Ilocano priest taught her advanced Spanish and encouraged her to develop her voice in poetry.\n\nFlorentino married a politician named Elias de los Reyes at the age of 14. They had five children together. Their son Isabelo de los Reyes later became a Filipino writer, activist and senator. Due to the feminist nature of her writings, Florentino was shunned by her husband and son; she lived alone in exile and separately from her family. She died at the age of 35.\n\nHer lyrical poetry in Spanish, and especially that in Ilocano, gained attention in various international forums in Spain, Paris and St. Louis, Missouri. Her literary contributions - particularly 22 preserved poems - were recognized when she was included in the \"Encyclopedia Internationale des Oeuvres des Femmes\" (International Encyclopedia of Women’s Works) in 1889. She is believed to be the first Filipina to receive this international recognition, an homage that occurred after her death at a young age.\n"}

{"id": "55282815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55282815", "title": "Michael Burnham", "text": "Michael Burnham\n\nMichael Burnham is a fictional character on \"\" portrayed by American actress Sonequa Martin-Green. She originally appears as the First Officer of the under Philippa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) until she commits mutiny and is stripped of rank. Burnham is later recruited by Gabriel Lorca (Jason Isaacs) on the as a science specialist after serving only six months of her life sentence, with Lorca viewing Burnham as an asset in the war against the Klingons. She serves as the series lead. The character is introduced as an anthropologist helping the Earth-based Starfleet understand and engage with new cultures in outer space.\n\nThe character is the first black female to lead a \"Star Trek\" television series, as well as the first leading character that has never been a Starfleet captain. (However, Burnham is captain of the ISS \"Shenzhou\" in the mirror universe.) Bryan Fuller conceived the character based on the cultural impact of Nichelle Nichols' portrayal of Uhura, Mae Jemison and Ruby Bridges. She is also revealed as the foster sister to Spock. Burnham is an orphan after her parents are killed by Klingons, until she is taken in by Sarek (James Frain). Controversy of the character arose with the decision to connect her history to Spock's family, with debates of continuity discussed among Trekkies. There was also controversy in casting a black female protagonist, which spawned debate online and accusations of racism. Development of the character was largely praised by critics leading up to the debut for having a black female lead for the first time in \"Star Trek\" history and reviews of Martin-Green's performance have been positive.\n\nIn December 2016, it was announced that Martin-Green would serve as the series lead of \"Star Trek: Discovery\", with the character initially named \"Rainsford\". In previous iterations of \"Star Trek\", Spock had never mentioned a sister. Executive producer Alex Kurtzman has explained that the specifics of Burnham's backstory would be revealed in a way that would not break the existing canon continuity. Unlike previous \"Star Trek\" leads, Burnham was not made a starship captain, \"to see a character from a different perspective on the starship—one who has different dynamic relationships with a captain, with subordinates, it gave us richer context\".\n\nThe character was originally to be referred to only by the name Number One, to honor the character of that name portrayed by Majel Barrett in the original \"Star Trek\" pilot \".\" With changes in the pre-production storyline, the character is found guilty of mutiny and no longer a First Officer by the end of the pilot episode. Thus, the Michael Burnham name was revealed during the first episode, quickly making \"Number One\" her informal name, the same as First Officer William Riker's informal name on the series \"\".\n\nSeries creator Bryan Fuller deliberately gave Martin-Green's character a traditionally male name, which he had done with the female leads (George, Jaye and Chuck) in three of his previous series. Martin-Green decided that the character was named after her father. Executive producer Aaron Harberts spoke to \"TV Guide\" and explained the reason for calling the character a traditionally male name, explaining, \"We've worked on many shows with Bryan and it's a motif. It's his signature move to name his lead women with names that would typically be associated as male.\" He felt the name was \"cool and different\" and pitched it himself explaining, \"[I was] thinking of female columnist Michael Sneed, who writes for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", and The Bangles' bassist Michael Steele.\" He added, \"And, of course, an archangel is named Michael as well, and it just had a lot of potency for us.\" Sonequa Martin-Green expressed enthusiasm about the name, liking the symbolism and anticipating a more gender-fluid and equal opportunity future. Of the name, she said, \"I appreciated the statement it makes all on its own to have this woman with this male name, just speaking of the amelioration of how we see men and women in the future.\"\n\nBryan Fuller had numerous inspirations for conceiving the character of Michael Burnham. He cited the cultural impact of Nichelle Nichols' portrayal of Uhura saying, \"I couldn't stop thinking about how many black people were inspired by seeing Nichelle Nichols on the bridge of a ship [as Lt. Uhura in The Original Series]\". Another inspiration came from the legacy of Ruby Bridges, the first black child to attend an all-white elementary school in Louisiana, as well as Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel in space.\n\nMartin-Green referred to her character as being \"the only human to have not just attended the Vulcan Science Academy but excelled as well, [which] speaks to Burnham's intellect and just sheer level of intelligence\". She referred to her character as \"highly disciplined, highly principled, and the Vulcan-Human dichotomy that lives within her is emblematic of her personality. It is the two realities living within me at all times.\"\n\nThe casting process was difficult for producers. They searched long and hard to find an actor to pull off Burnham's divided nature between Vulcan and human. Harberts said, \"We read a lot of people and they either went way too robotic and chilly or way too emotional. What's beautiful about Sonequa's performance is she's capable of playing two, three, four things at once. She's got such a great command of her craft, she's able to be aloof but warm; logical but able to surrender her emotional side to the audience.\" Alex Kurtzman felt the character's portrayal needed to have \"remarkable duality inside her\" between being \"highly emotional\" while also being \"contained\". \"Unlike Spock, who is half-human, half-Vulcan, she is all human, but she's been trained with the kind of Vulcan emotional-suppression ideology, and that is very challenging for her... you can see that wrestling match going on in every moment. That was the single most important thing to define the character, and I think we just had a sense that [Sonequa] intuitively understood it.\" He went further to express the challenges in casting an actor for the part saying, \"It's a tough thing to learn with actors. You either have the ability to roll that off your tongue, or you don't. And if you don't, everything kind of trips over itself... And when [Sonequa] read, we all breathed a massive sigh of relief, because she brought an instant authenticity to it. It was very clear that the language was not going to be difficult for her.\"\n\nSonequa Martin-Green first met with \"Discovery\" co-creator Bryan Fuller at New York Comic-Con in October 2016. Fuller talked to her about Burnham, a human orphan raised on planet Vulcan alongside Spock (Leonard Nimoy) from the original series, leading to a conflict with her two cultural identities. Knowing that her character Sasha would be killed off \"The Walking Dead\", she shot a video audition. However, AMC refused to release her from her contract, leading CBS to look elsewhere. Fuller revealed that he had long set his sights on Martin-Green to star in \"Discovery\", but CBS pushed back because AMC would not release her from her contract until Sasha's death was shown on-screen. CBS' second premiere date delay from May to September was due to the restrictions of Martin-Green's contract, though the first delay opened the door for her to land the role. She auditioned in person in December, and then began shooting in January. On getting the part, she expressed nervousness and excitement saying, \"When I first got started, I had my freak-out phase. I had my almost catatonic moment where I thought, 'What is happening?' And I knew very quickly that I couldn't live there and that I couldn't create there. I owed it to the story and I owed it to the legacy to get it together. And I had to focus myself in gratitude. I had to focus myself on the passion for the vision for the story that we're doing.\"\n\nThe casting for Michael Burnham, under the pseudonym \"Commander Rainsford\" leaked in December 2016, with many speculating Martin-Green's previous role as Sasha on \"The Walking Dead\" would come to an end. Following the announcement, Nichelle Nichols tweeted \"All my love @SonequaMG, I've been smiling since I heard. You're gonna knock em dead.\" Charlie Jane Anders for \"Wired\" felt Martin-Green's casting fulfilled Gene Roddenberry's ultimate vision saying, \"It's all too easy to see Star Trek's humanism as merely a matter of embracing science and rejecting barbarism—but that's missing what makes Trek's version of humanism so powerful. Diversity was always a key part of Star Trek's vision of a better future for humanity. In the ideal world of the 24th century, every human being has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential, either in the sciences or elsewhere; anything less doesn't represent real progress.\" Showrunner of \"The Walking Dead\" admitted it was unfortunate that the casting leak happened, spoiling events to come, but that \"The folks over at Star Trek got lucky with the timing\".\n\nOn the importance and impact of the role, Martin-Green said, \"My casting says that the sky is the limit for all of us. I think what we're seeing now in our media is this push to diminish and to devalue and to make people feel that the sky is not the limit for them, that they are meant for the ground. So having me as the first black female lead of a Star Trek just blasts that into a million pieces. I am eternally grateful that the diverse casting of our show means that we are now a part of the conversation and hopefully a part of making the world a better place, as cliché as this sounds. Because I really believe it and think its vital for us all right now\". Nichols and Martin-Green both posed together on the red carpet at the \"Star Trek: Discovery\" premiere. Martin-Green shared on Instagram that Nichols whispered, \"Enjoy this time. It's yours now.\" Sonequa Martin-Green praised Nichols thereafter saying, \"What a blessing, what a woman. I stand on your shoulders Nichelle Nichols\".\n\nFollowing the release of the first trailer for \"Discovery\" in May 2017, some fans expressed outrage at the decision to have a black woman helm the series, in addition to the depiction of an Asian, female captain. Referred to as \"white genocide in space\", the decision to create a diverse cast sparked debate online on the question of what had been referred to as 'forced diversity'. Media outlets, including \"The Chicago Tribune\" and \"The New Yorker\" referred to the impact of Uhura and the kiss between the character of Uhura and of Captain Kirk as being the first interracial kiss on American television, and its subsequent societal impact that Trek fans would be aware of, making the criticisms baffling.\n\nGeorge Takei, the actor who played Sulu in \"\" offered his view on the issue of cast diversity in the \"Star Trek\" franchise. He said, \"You know, when you go out into space, you're going to have even greater diversity. These so-called trolls haven't seen a single episode of the new series because it hasn't been aired. And they don't know the history of 'Star Trek,' that Gene Rodenberry created this with the idea of finding strength in our diversity.\"\n\nMartin-Green spoke out on the criticism, saying she \"would encourage [critics of the diverse cast] to key into the essence and spirit of \"Star Trek\" that has made it the legacy it is—and that's looking across the way to the person sitting in front of you and realizing you are the same, that they are not separate from you, and we are all one. That's something 'Star Trek' has always upheld and I completely believe that is why it's been a mainstay in society in the hearts of so many people for so many decades. [...] It's one of the foundational principles of \"Star Trek\" and I feel if you miss that then you miss the legacy itself. I'm incredibly proud to be the lead of this show and be at the forefront of an iteration of Star Trek that's from the eyes of a black woman that's never been done before, though obviously there's been other forms of diversity that have been innovated by Trek. I feel like we're taking another step forward, which I think all stories should do. We should go boldly where nobody has gone before and stay true to that.\"\n\nBurnham was born to human parents, who were killed when she was a child during a Klingon raid on a Human-Vulcan research facility on Doctari Alpha, where the family lived. She was then adopted by the Vulcan ambassador Sarek (James Frain) and his human wife Amanda (Mia Kirshner), who are also the biological parents of Starfleet officer Spock, and moved to the Vulcan homeworld. She was the first human to attend both the Vulcan Learning Center and Vulcan Science Academy as a xenoanthropologist. After completing the academy she was brought by Sarek, who shared his Katra with Burnham, to the USS \"Shenzhou\" to rejoin her people.\n\nThe decision to make Burnham related to the history of original series character Spock was controversial. Beth Elderkin for \"io9\" decided that it \"breaks canon\" and that \"It seems unlike Spock to completely ignore someone who seemed to be a major part of his life—especially one who came into his life after such tragedy.\" In contrast, Laurie Ulster of \"TrekMovie.com\" felt the decision was \"not that big of a deal\", clashing with Elderkin's point about Spock, citing the fact that Spock never mentioned his half-brother Sybok until he showed up, or revealed his parents were Sarek and Amanda, as well as the numerous \"secret siblings\" placed in \"Star Trek\".\n\nIn the series premiere of \"Discovery\", she has already served under Captain Georgiou on the USS \"Shenzhou\" for seven years. The series opens with \"Shenzhou\" encountering the Klingons, with Burnham committing an act of mutiny, breaking Starfleet regulation to give the order to fire first, avoiding a full-scale war, in an attempt to save her captain and ship against the Klingons. Her plan is unsuccessful and she is detained. In \"Battle at the Binary Stars\", Burnham escapes the brig and convinces Georgiou to take T'Kuvma hostage. However, T'Kuvma kills Georgiou. In a moment of emotional weakness, Burnham kills T'Kuvma, making him a martyr. She is convicted of mutiny, stripped of rank, and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn \"Context is for Kings\", USS \"Discovery\"s Captain Gabriel Lorca brings Burnham back to duty with a temporary war-time assignment as a scientist on his crew, praising her risk taking behaviour as valuable in the war. She is met with hostility among the \"Discovery\" crew, being viewed as responsible for starting the war with the Klingons. Burnham eventually befriends her roommate, Sylvia Tilly (Mary Wiseman). In , Lorca orders Burnham and Landry (Rekha Sharma) to find a way to weaponize Ripper, a violent macroscopic Tardigrade found on the USS \"Glenn\". Burnham hypothesizes that Ripper's behavior on the \"Glenn\" was defensive in nature and that he was not inherently dangerous, since biological analysis showed him to be herbivorous. But with the Klingons attacking Corvan II, Landry was desperate for results and fired a phaser at him, causing him to maul her to death. She also overcomes her fear of opening the last will of Georgiou through Tilly's coercion. She learns Georgiou left her with a telescope, a prized possession handed down through her family for hundreds of years, noting Burnham as a curious explorer and believing she has her own command at this point. In , Burnham voices her concerns about the spore drive jumps used on Ripper as Saru is acting captain upon Lorca's abduction by Klingons. Saru is outraged at Burnham for turning the spore-drive offline without his knowledge, and searching for compatible DNA sequences to replace Ripper. Burnham suggests a human host replacement would be possible, but Saru disregards her point, calling her a predator. Later, Burnham asks if he is afraid of her, but he tells her he is jealous because he wanted to learn everything from Georgiou and she did instead, and rather than she become captain and teach him, her actions led him to be unprepared as acting captain for today. Burnham gives Saru the telescope Georgiou gave her, feeling she doesn't deserve it. Saru lets Burnham free Ripper back into space, and Stamets becomes the host replacement needed, injecting himself with tardigrade DNA.\n\nIn , Sarek is almost killed and Burnham is forced to save him. She discovers he chose his biological son Spock over her, as Sarek was given only one option of which child to send to the Vulcan Expedition Group, with the Vulcans considering both children \"experiments\" (half-human and full human indoctrinated in Vulcan culture). The decision is ultimately pointless as Spock chose Starfleet, after Burnham was forced to go. After retrieving Sarek, Burnham attempts to get Sarek to open up to her about their encounter. Sarek pretends to be unaware, but Burnham can tell he is lying, saying he can do better. She says they will have the conversation one day, and leaves calling him \"father\" to spite him after he said they were technically not family because they are not related. She also develops a friendship with Ash Tyler (Shazad Latif), who helps her through Sarek attempting to push her away. In , Harry Mudd (Rainn Wilson) takes over \"Discovery\" and keeps the ship in a time loop so he can complete his mission to sell the ship to the Klingons. Burnham appears uncomfortable as, during this time, a party is occurring and she struggles with her romantic feelings for Tyler. Stamets (Anthony Rapp), the only one aware of the time loop, warns Burnham while also helping her with her feelings for Tyler. Burnham and Tyler dance and kiss, before Mudd kills him. Burnham manipulates Mudd into turning back time again to save him, revealing who she is and how high a prize she is for the Klingons. She kills herself to convince Mudd to do so, although the next time around, Burnham successfully tricks Mudd and he is sent away. Burnham and Tyler are left to imagine their first kiss, which they only know of because Stamets has told them about it happening. In , Burnham and Tyler go with Saru to the planet Pahvo to discover the technology behind the Klingons' cloaking technology, where they kiss again and renew their romance. In , Burnham convinces Lorca to let her enter the Klingon Sarcophagus ship, where Burnham gets into a fight with Kol (Kenneth Mitchell), ultimately escaping and retrieving Philippa's badge. An attack is made on Kol's ship, blowing it up. Burnham notices Tyler's PTSD attack caused by seeing L'Rell (Mary Chieffo) and later learns that Tyler allowed her to sexually abuse him in order to stay alive.\n\nIn , the USS \"Discovery\" transports to the mirror universe. Burnham learns she earned the rank of captain on the ISS \"Shenzhou\". During her career, she won medals for Valor, for being a Master of Poisons, and for 100 kills. While in command of the ISS \"Shenzhou\", she was ordered to hunt down Gabriel Lorca, who was attempting a coup against the emperor. Her shuttlecraft was destroyed during this operation and she is presumed dead. Burnham is forced to disguise as her Terran counterpart on the ISS \"Shenzhou\" in order to retrieve the data files on the \"Constitution\"-class USS \"Defiant\", to uncover how it crossed into the mirror universe's past. Burnham and Lorca play the part of their Terran selves. Ensign Connor, who is now Captain Connor, attempts to kill Burnham in an attempt to maintain his new position, but fails. The ISS \"Shenzhou\" applaud Burnham for her killing as she takes the captain's chair. Later, Burnham appears exhausted keeping up the act, and goes to her quarters where she and Tyler, who joined Burnham as her personal bodyguard, have sex.\n\nIn , Burnham becomes increasingly agitated with her facade as Mirror Burnham, and questions how long you can keep a facade up until you actually become something you initially weren't. She is alarmed by Mirror Saru, who is a nameless slave in this universe, and decides to name him Saru in honor of her friend. Mirror Saru is shocked by her friendly gesture. Burnham is tasked to destroy a rebel base on the planet Harlak. Instead, she and Tyler opt to form a secret alliance with the Vulcans, Klingons, Andorians and Tellarites who oppose the Terran Empire. Voq appears, the mirror universe counterpart of the Klingon she fought at the Binary Stars, and asks Mirror Sarek, known as The Prophet, to mind meld with Burnham to see if her intentions are pure. Mirror Sarek is taken aback by Burnham's memories, and concludes she is a compassionate person who means them no harm. Burnham becomes curious of Voq's ability to forge alliances with other alien races, in order to find the solution to the Klingon war in her universe. Voq's explanation triggers Ash who speaks in Klingon and attacks Voq. Burnham convinces Mirror Voq to spare Tyler's life. When Burnham and Tyler return to the ISS \"Shenzhou\", having faked the attack, she confronts Tyler. Tyler admits he doesn't think he is actually Ash Tyler. It becomes apparent Tyler is actually Voq and speaking with Mirror Voq set off his true nature, having been brought on the USS \"Discovery\" originally as a sleeper agent all along. Burnham is confused, but then realizes Tyler is the one she fought at the Binary Stars. Tyler, now mentally fully turned into Voq, attempts to kill her. Burnham is unable to defend herself, and Mirror Saru arrives and attacks Tyler, saving her. Burnham fakes Tyler's execution, actually transporting him to the \"Discovery\" ship together with the files from the where he is held captive. Later, Burnham is dismayed to learn her falsities at Harlak have been uncovered by the silent emperor, who turns out to be her former captain Philippa Georgiou's mirror version.\n\nIn , Burnham and Lorca are transported to the ISS \"Charon\", as the revelation that Georgiou is the emperor weighs down on her, making her feel the situation is a reckoning for her betrayal of her own Georgiou. Lorca refuses to bow to Georgiou, and is taken to an agony booth. Georgiou suspects Burnham of deception, and holding a knife to her neck asks why she has come here, revealing she is aware that she conspired to kill her and take her throne with Lorca. Burnham is left shocked by this revelation of her mirror counterpart's betrayal as well. When she refers to the emperor as \"Philippa\", she is outraged, as she would normally refer to her as \"mother\". Later, Burnham reveals prior to her execution that she is from another universe, using Prime Philippa's insignia as proof. Emperor Georgiou agrees to make a deal with Burnham to exchange the spore drive technology in exchange for her freedom to go home. Later, Burnham learns more about her mirror counterpart's history. In this universe, due to Terran supremacy, rather than Sarek and Amanda raising Michael after her parents were killed, Emperor Philippa Georgiou did instead. However, Mirror Burnham's quest to hunt down Lorca appears to be a ruse, as she was conspiring against her own adoptive mother to kill her and take her throne with Lorca, who Mirror Burnham once viewed as a father figure, until she grew up and it became romantic. Georgiou tells Burnham about Lorca planning to \"cross time and space itself to take what was rightfully his\" and Burnham puts the pieces together, along with Georgiou's sensitivity to light (the single biological difference between the Terrans and humans), that Lorca is from the mirror universe and their crossing over was not an accident.\n\nIn , Burnham works out a plan to deliver Georgiou to Lorca in the same way she planned. Burnham tells Lorca she will stay in exchange for \"Discovery\"s safe passage home, but it is a ruse, as Georgiou and Burnham begin attacking and killing Lorca's men. Eventually, Burnham gets the upper hand on Lorca with a phaser, telling him that they would've helped him get home, because that's who Starfleet is, and that is who she is, which is why she won't kill him. Georgiou, however, kills him instead. She then allows Burnham to go back home, with her reign as emperor gone given Lorca's rebellion, deciding to die killing Lorca's men. However, Burnham saves Georgiou at the last minute, holding onto her, as they are transported back to the \"Discovery\" and into the prime universe.\n\nIn , the \"Discovery\" jumps nine months ahead in 2257, with the Federation suffering significant losses in the war with the Klingons. Burnham reveals to Admiral Cornwell and Sarek about the arrival of their guest, Emperor Georgiou. Burnham asks Cornwell to give Emperor Georgiou political asylum, feeling sympathy for her, despite not being her Georgiou. Later, Tilly convinces Burnham to confront Ash, who is now fully recovered with dual memories, feeling deep remorse for Voq's actions. Sarek tells her not to regret loving someone, encouraging her further. Burnham ultimately ends their relationship. Ash begs her, saying he can't make it without her, but Burnham explains she was lost after the battle of the binary stars, and having to reclaim life is punishing and solitary.\n\nIn the season one finale, , Emperor Georgiou poses as Prime Georgiou, enlisted by Starfleet to end the war however she sees fit in exchange for her freedom. Burnham, Tilly and Tyler accompany her to Qo'nos. Ultimately, Burnham is forced to stop Georgiou's genocidal attack on the Klingon home planet, outraged at Cornwell and Starfleet for enabling the act. Burnham manipulates Georgiou to give her the explosive device, by telling her if she doesn't, she will have to watch her daughter die again. Georgiou reluctantly agrees and walks off to her freedom. Burnham offers L'Rell a peace treaty, to call off the Klingons' planned invasion on Earth in exchange for the device as a measure of peace and diplomacy in order to end the war. Ash reassures a reluctant L'Rell to take charge. After the incident, Burnham's act of diplomacy in finishing the war ends with her, and many of the the \"Discovery\" crew, decorated by Starfleet with the Medal of Honor for their heroic actions. Burnham is fully reinstated as a Commander in Starfleet, her record is expunged, she is pardoned by the Federation President, and she becomes the Chief Science Officer for the \"Discovery\". Burnham and Tyler decide to go their separate ways, Tyler planning to find a union between humans and Klingons with L'Rell, and Burnham back aboard \"Discovery\". On their course to Vulcan to pick up the new \"Discovery\" captain, they receive a transmission from Captain Christopher Pike of the USS \"Enterprise\".\n\nPrior to the release of the television series, an original tie-in novel taking place in 2255, one year prior to the pilot, was announced. The novel titled \"Star Trek Discovery: Desperate Hours\" sees Burnham face the challenge needed in being a first officer upon recent promotion. The synopsis describes Burnham's journey as \"To save thousands of innocent lives, Burnham must infiltrate the alien ship. But to do so she needs to face the truth of her troubled past, and seek the aid of a man she has tried to avoid her entire life—until now.\" She also works with her foster brother Spock, who visits the \"Shenzhou\" along with Captain Pike.\n\nWriting for E! News, Chris Harnick reviewed the first two episodes of \"Discovery\"—\"The Vulcan Hello\" and \"Battle at the Binary Stars\"—and considered Martin-Green's performance the strongest element of the show. He praised her acting as a human raised in a Vulcan world by saying, \"[T]he emotional conflict between the two ideologies in Michael Burnham is perhaps the most interesting part of the series, and presents a fascinating window into the world of \"Star Trek: Discovery\".\" Writing for the episode \"Context Is for Kings\", Mallory Ortberg of \"Vulture\" referred to Martin-Green as \"the standout\" who is \"given a lot more to work with and is, in turn, captivating, charming (I didn't know I wanted to see her scrabbling through a series of Jefferies tubes reciting Alice in Wonderland to herself until it happened), and heartbreakingly winsome.\"\n\nChaim Gartenberg for \"The Verge\" praised the uniqueness of Burnham in comparison to previous \"Trek\" protagonists saying, \"[she] isn't like any protagonist we've seen in \"Star Trek\" so far, and not only because she doesn't command a starship or space station. She's a far more rounded, human character than any of the previous captains, with some serious trauma from a Klingon attack in her youth that's left her predisposed to hate the warrior race. And while \"Star Trek\" has plumbed the 'main character has demons' well in the past—most notably with Sisko in \"Deep Space Nine\", and Picard in the later films, when it comes to the Borg—Burnham feels far more compelling for not being a flawless human being in other respects, as her series-protagonist predecessors were.\"\n\n\"TV Guide\" listed Sonequa Martin-Green in the ranking of \"The 25 Best TV Performances of 2017\" coming at 14. The article highlighted, \"Martin-Green has delivered the sort of performance that lights up every moment she's on screen. This is how stars are born.\" \"CultureFly\"s David Bedwell included Burnham in their list of \"11 Best TV Characters of 2017\" saying, \"With their first ever black female lead and a character that's hardly straight-laced, Sonequa Martin-Green gets a lot to sink her teeth into.\n\n\"Variety\" added Martin-Green among the list of Top Breakout TV Stars of 2017 in the role of Burnham. Joe Otterson said, \"Despite a lot of negative news coming out ahead of \"Discovery's\" premiere (including multiple premiere date delays), Martin-Green deftly took on the challenge of leading the new installment of the iconic sci-fi franchise. Her portrayal of convicted Starfleet mutineer Michael Burnham made the new show truly binge-worthy.\"\n\nMartin-Green was chosen as \"TVLine\" performer of the week for the episode \"The Wolf Inside\", as she \"conveyed the resulting shock in gut-wrenching fashion, her eyes welling up with tears as Burnham was forced to point a phaser at the man she thought she loved.\" They went further saying, \"Equally adept at big action scenes and quiet character moments, Martin-Green has been the glue holding Star Trek: Discovery together all season long—and all those weeks of repressed emotion just made this week's splendid showcase all the more impactful. Here's hoping Burnham lives long... and prospers.\"\n\nIn reviewing the full season, Marissa Martinelli of \"Slate\" felt that Martin-Green saved \"Discovery\" from \"getting lost in a maze of plot twists [...] As a human raised by Vulcans, it would have been easy to make Burnham yet another Spock or Data, her humanity buried under layers and layers of logic. Instead, Martin-Green plays her with a fierce charisma and warmth, making Burnham not only a compass in the wilderness but a light in the darkness, too.\" Although the reviewer also felt Burnham's arc wrapped up \"too neatly\".\n\nSome critics had a negative reaction to Burnham's arc. Andy Vandervell for \"Wired\" expressed disappointment in the conclusion of Burnham's first season arc saying, \"I can see what they were trying to do with the finale in completing Michael Burnham's journey from mutineer to saviour of the Federation, both literally and figuratively, but the execution was so clumsy and anti-climactic it just undercut all the emotional weight of her story.\" Zack Handlen for \"The A.V. Club\" commented, \"I can sort of see how Burnham changed (the trip to the Mirror Universe taught her the consequences of brutal thinking), but the show has done such a terrible job at establishing the character and motivations of Starfleet and the Federation that the sudden decision to commit murder on such a massive, unprecedented scale is at once shocking and utterly weightless.\"\n\nLiz Shannon Miller for \"IndieWire\" and James Luxford for \"Metro\" appreciated the conclusions of Burnham's arc. Miller said, \"Burnham's lengthy speech to the council awarding her and her fellow crewmen with well-deserved honors had plenty of standout moments. But there's something interesting about her choice to invoke Voq's official title within the Klingon Empire, which speaks to how both civilizations are now struggling to sort out their place in the world\", while Luxford commented, \"It's great to see Burnham redeemed.\" Scott Collura for \"IGN\" said, \"There's a nice symmetry to Burnham and Voq/Tyler's journeys between the pilot episode and this finale, with Michael once again staging a sort of mutiny, only this time doing so for all the right reasons and with the support of her friends too.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "562838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=562838", "title": "Military career of Simón Bolívar", "text": "Military career of Simón Bolívar\n\nThe military and political career of Simón Bolívar, (July 24, 1783 – December 17, 1830), which included both formal service in the armies of various revolutionary regimes and actions organized by himself or in collaboration with other exiled patriot leaders during the years from 1811 to 1830, was an important element in the success of the independence wars in South America. Given the unstable political climate during these years, Bolívar and other patriot leaders, such as Santiago Mariño, Manuel Piar, José Francisco Bermúdez and Francisco de Paula Santander often had to go into exile in the Caribbean or nearby areas of Spanish America that at the moment were controlled by those favoring independence, and from there, carry on the struggle. These wars resulted in the creation of several South American states out of the former Spanish colonies, the currently existing Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, and the now defunct Gran Colombia.\n\nIn his twenty one-year career, Bolívar faced two main challenges. First was gaining acceptance as undisputed leader of the republican cause. Despite claiming such a role since 1813, he began to achieve this only in 1817, and consolidated his hold on power after his dramatic and unexpected victory in New Granada in 1819. His second challenge was implementing a vision of unifying the region into one large state, which he believed (and most would agree, correctly) would be the only guarantee of maintaining American independence from the Spanish in northern South America. His early experiences under the First Venezuelan Republic and in New Granada convinced him that divisions among republicans, augmented by federal forms of government, only allowed Spanish American royalists to eventually gain the upper hand. Once again, it was his victory in 1819 that gave him the leverage to bring about the creation of a unified state, Gran Colombia, with which to oppose the Spanish Monarchy on the continent.\n\nThe idea of independence for Spanish America had existed for several years among a minority of the residents of northern South America. In 1797 the Venezuelans Manuel Gual and José María España, inspired by exiled Spaniard Juan Bautista Picornell, unsuccessfully attempted to establish a republic in Venezuela with greater social equality for Venezuelans of all racial and social backgrounds. Nine years later, in 1806 long-time Venezuelan expatriate Francisco de Miranda led a small group of mostly British and American foreign volunteers in an attempt to take over Venezuela and set up an independent republic. Like Gual and España's conspiracy, Miranda's putsch failed to attract Venezuelans of any social and economic class, in fact local Venezuelans organized the resistance to Miranda's invasion and quickly dispersed it. The lack of interest on the part of the Venezuelan Criollos is often explained by their fear that the loss of the removal of Spanish control might bring about a revolution that would destroy their own power in Venezuela. Nevertheless, in the decades leading up to 1806, Criollos had often been at odds with the Spanish Crown: they wanted an expansion of the free trade that was benefiting their plantation economy and objected to the Crown's new policy of granting social privileges that had been traditionally been reserved for whites (\"españoles\") to Pardos through the purchase of certificates of whiteness (\"gracias al sacar\"). So the Criollos' failure to support Gual, España and Miranda, which would have created a state under their control, needs to also be understood by the fact that a national identity separate from the Spanish had not yet emerged among them.\n\nIn neighboring New Granada tensions also existed with the Crown but had not evolved into an outright desire for separation. In 1779 the Revolt of the Comuneros pitted middle-class and rural residents against the royal authorities over the issue of new taxes instituted as part of the Bourbon Reforms. Although the revolt was stopped and the leaders punished or executed, the uprising did manage to slow down the economic reforms that the Crown had planned for New Granada. In the subsequent decades, a few New Granadans, like Antonio Nariño, became intrigued by the ideas of the French Revolution and attempted to promote its values by disseminating translated documents like the \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\". Again, this was a minority and not necessarily a sign that the majority in New Granada did not see themselves as members of the Spanish Monarchy.\n\nThe break with the Crown came in 1808 with the disappearance of a stable government in Spain. The crisis was precipitated by Napoleon's removal of Bourbon Dynasty from the throne of Spain (he convinced Ferdinand VII to abdicate, and his father Charles IV to renounce any claim to returning to the throne he had abdicated only months earlier) and his invasion of Spain. As the entire Spanish world rejected the new Bonaparte Dynasty (Napoleon gave the crown of Spain to his brother, the King of Naples and Sicily), Spain itself fell into chaos and it took almost a year for a coordinated, centralized provisional government (the Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies) to form. Even then, the rapid and large French advances in the Peninsula seemed to make the idea of a stable government in Spain pointless. By 1810, the Supreme Junta was cornered in the island city of Cadiz during the two-year Siege of Cádiz. Throughout Spanish America, people felt it was time to take the government into their own hands, if a Spanish world, independent of the French, were to continue to exist at all, and therefore in 1810 juntas were set up throughout the Americas, including in Caracas and Bogotá, just as they had been in Spain two years earlier.\n\nIn 1809 a twenty-six-year-old Bolívar had retreated to his estate in the Valleys of Aragua, refusing to openly participate in calls for the establishment of a Venezuelan junta, because the plans did not consider the option of independence. He was still in his country estates when a junta was successfully established on April 19, 1810. The new Junta of Caracas chose him to be part of a delegation to the United Kingdom to seek British aid. The delegation did not have much success, but Bolívar did return in December 1810 with Francisco de Miranda, who saw an opportunity in the political turmoil to return to Venezuela.\n\nCivil war broke out between the provinces of Venezuela that recognized the Caracas Junta and those that still recognized the Regency in Spain that had replaced the Supreme Central Junta. The situation became more tense when a congress, called by the Caracas Junta, declared independence on July 5, 1811, sparking rebellions in favor of the Regency and Cádiz Cortes in Valencia. Bolívar's first military service was as an officer under Miranda's command in the units created to put down this revolt. Bolívar was promoted to colonel and made commandant of Puerto Cabello the following year. At the same time that Frigate Captain Domingo de Monteverde was making fast and vast advances into republican territory from the west (his forces had entered Valencia on May 3, 1812), Bolívar lost control of San Felipe Castle along with its ammunition stores on June 30, when the royalist prisoners held there managed to take it over and attack the small number of troops in the city. Deciding that the situation was lost, Bolívar effectively abandoned his post and retreated to his estate farm in San Mateo. Miranda also saw the republican cause as lost and authorized a capitulation with Monteverde on July 25.\n\nThe terms of the Capitulation of San Mateo, which Monteverde approved but which Miranda never came to sign, granted amnesty and the right to emigrate from Venezuela to all republicans, if they chose to do so. Nevertheless, there was great confusion among the republicans as to what the treaty actually contained or if Monteverde would keep his word. It was in this uncertain environment that Miranda chose to abandon the country before Monteverde occupied Caracas. In the early morning of August 1, Miranda was sleeping in the house of the commandant of La Guaira, Colonel Manuel María Casas, when he was awakened by Casas, Bolívar, Miguel Peña and four other soldiers, who promptly arrested Miranda for treason to the Republic and turned him over to Monteverde. For his apparent services to the royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bolívar a passport, and Bolívar left for Curaçao on August 27.\n\nIn Curaçao Bolívar learned that Monteverde had broken the promises given in the Capitulation of San Mateo. Many of the republicans who had stayed behind were arrested and the property of many republicans, both in Venezuela and in exile, were confiscated to make up for the large deficits the government faced. Bolívar decided to rejoin the patriot cause and made his way to Cartagena de Indias, which had established itself as an independent republic on November 11, 1811 (in reaction as much to events in Spain as to attempts by the junta in Bogotá to control it) and joined a few days later in a confederation with four other provinces, the United Provinces of New Granada. In the weeks before arriving in Cartagena in October 1812, Bolívar began to analyze the collapse of the Venezuelan republic and published his thoughts in December in his Cartagena Manifesto. In the document Bolívar blamed the failure on the federal nature of the Venezuelan republic, which had allowed provinces to ignore the needs of other provinces threatened by Monteverde's advance, and the intransigence of the Venezuelan population to the republican cause, among other things. He saw the Venezuelan case as a warning to the divided New Granada and urged it to retake Caracas from the royalists. He enlisted as an officer in the army of the New Granadan Union and led forces in the Magdalena Campaign against cities in the lower Magdalena River that had refused to accept Cartagena's authority or that of the Union, and then attacked Ocaña. His success in these operations convinced the congress of the Union to authorize his plans to invade Venezuela in May 1813, and thus began his Admirable Campaign.\n\nHis reentry into Venezuela marked a new, more violent phase of the wars of independence. Monteverde's troops had already carried out atrocities: he had allowed his soldiers to loot many of the cities he occupied and several of his commanders became notorious for torturing and killing civilians suspected of collaborating with the Republic. Bolívar also faced the fact that by 1813 much of the older aristocrats, who had led the republic, had abandoned the cause of independence, and the general population had turned against republicanism even before its collapse. In order to drive a wedge between Venezuelans and Peninsulares, Bolívar's instituted a policy of no quarter in his Decree of War to the Death, in which he promised to kill any Peninsular who did not actively support his efforts to restore independence and to spare any American even if they actively collaborated with Monteverde or the royalists.\n\nBolívar's push towards Caracas was aided by the fact that the general population, which had welcomed Monteverde a year earlier, had become disillusioned by his failure to implement the terms of the San Mateo Capitulation or the Spanish Constitution of 1812, which the capitulation promised. Monteverde also faced attacks on two fronts, since Santiago Mariño had already opened a front on the east in January 1813. Bolívar's forces easily defeated the overtaxed and underpaid royalist army in a series of battles, entered Caracas on August 6, 1813, and laid siege to Monteverde, who had retreated to Puerto Cabello. In Caracas Bolívar announced the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic, but placed himself at the head of a military government, since the situation did not allow for the restoration of the old authorities or new elections. Bolívar would base his subsequent and enduring claim to be the sole head of the Venezuelan republic and commander-in-chief of its forces on this accomplishment, although even at this time he was not universally acknowledged as head of the state or the republican forces. Mariño, based in Cumaná, did not recognize Bolívar's claim, but did collaborate with him militarily. Reprisals were carried out against Peninsular royalists that were captured. It was in during this period that the republican city fathers of Caracas, following the example of Mérida, granted Bolívar the title of Liberator and office of captain general in the Church of San Francisco (the more appropriate site, the Cathedral of Caracas, was still damaged from the 1812 earthquake).\n\nBolívar and Mariño's success, like Monteverde's a year earlier, was short-lived. The new Republic failed to convince the common people that it was not a tool of the urban elite. Lower-class people, especially the southern, rural \"llaneros\" (cowboys), flocked to the royalist cause. \"Llaneros\" played a key military role in the region's struggle. Turning the tide against independence, these highly mobile, ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed Bolívar out of his home country once more. By 1814, the regular royalist army headed by Governor and Captain General Juan Manuel Cajigal was overshadowed by a large, irregular force of \"llaneros\" recruited and led by José Tomás Boves. With the royalist irregulars displaying the same passion and violence that Bolívar had demonstrated in his \"war to the death\" decree, the republicans suffered their first major setback at the Battle of La Puerta on June 15, 1814, and Boves took Caracas on July 16. The republicans and Criollo royalists in Caracas, who also feared Boves's \"llanero\" hoards, had to flee en masse to Mariño's strongholds in the east. The combined forces of Mariño's and Bolívar were defeated again at Aragua de Barcelona on August 18, at a cost of 2,000 royalist casualties of the 10,000 troops they fielded, most of the 3,000 combatants in the republican army, in addition to many civilian casualties. Due to their series of repeated reverses both Bolívar and Mariño were arrested and removed from power by José Félix Ribas and Manuel Piar, each representing the two republican commands then in place in Venezuela. A few days later Ribas and Piar decided not to try them and instead released them into exile. On September 8, Bolívar and Mariño set sail for Cartagena de Indias, leaving Piar and Ribas to lead the increasingly encircled republicans.\n\nEarlier in March 1814, Ferdinand VII had returned to the throne. The Sixth Coalition's advances made it impossible for Napoleon to continue holding Ferdinand or fighting in Spain. Once in Spain, however, Ferdinand was not pleased by the revolution in government that had been undertaken in his name, and by May he had abolished the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and began persecuting and arresting the liberals responsible for its creation. To deal with the Americas, Ferdinand organized the largest expeditionary force that Spain ever sent to the Americas up to that time. Colonel Pablo Morillo, a veteran of the Spanish struggle against the French was chosen as its commander. The expeditionary force was made up of approximately 10,000 men and nearly sixty ships. Originally, they were to head for Montevideo in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, another region that had fallen out of royalist control, but soon it was decided to send these forces to the Venezuela and New Granada, where the war had become exceedingly savage. Realizing that this change in plans would not go over well with the soldiers, the news was kept from them until they were at sea. When the expeditionary force arrived in Venezuela, it found that most of it had been restored to royalist control, save for Margarita Island, which surrendered to it with no blood shed. With Venezuela pacified, plans were quickly made to subdue neighboring New Granada, and the bulk of the troops moved to the coastal city of Santa Marta, which had remained in royalist hands since 1810.\n\nLike many other Venezuelan republicans who fled to New Granada after the second wave of royalist victories, Bolívar once again entered into the service of the United Provinces and fought against cities that had refused to acknowledge its authority. His forces took Bogotá on December 12, 1814, after an eight-month-long war, and was promoted to captain general for his efforts. He was then given the task of capturing the royalist stronghold, Santa Marta, but Cartagena, the obvious base from which to launch this offensive, refused to give him the necessary soldiers and supplies, so infighting broke out. As Santa Martan forces gained ground against the divided republicans in northern New Granada, Bolívar left for Jamaica on May 8, 1815. Cartagena would fall to Morillo in December 1815 and Bogotá in May of the following year.\n\nNow thirty-two years of age, he found himself in exile for the second time. In Jamaica, Bolívar once again issued a manifesto explaining his view of the failure of the republican cause in Venezuela. His famous Letter from Jamaica, though ostensibly written to one man, was an appeal to Great Britain specifically and the European powers in general to aid the cause of Spanish American independence, but it found no significant response. So he turned to the small and isolated republic of Haiti, that had freed itself from French rule, but being composed of mostly former slaves, received little aid from either the United States or Europe. Bolívar and other Venezuelan and New Granadan exiles were warmly received by the Haitian president Alexandre Pétion. The growing exile community would receive money, volunteers and weapons from the Haitian president enabling them to resume plans to continue the struggle for independence. There was debate, however, over who should be in charge, but his ability to win over Pétion and a Curaçaoan sea merchant, Luis Brión (he is traditionally referred to by the Spanish form of his name), who had just acquired a much-needed warship in England to aid the embattled Cartagenan Republic, forced the other Venezuelan leaders to grudgingly accept his leadership. Pétion, for his part, convinced Bolívar to expand the fight for independence to include the liberation of slaves.\n\nThe émigrés successfully captured a beachhead at Los Cayos on March 31, 1816. Bolívar proclaimed the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic and in two decrees of June 2 and July 16 declared the freedom of slaves conditional on their joining the republican forces. Shortly thereafter, Margarita Island, safely separated by water from Morillo's forces, rejoined the republican cause and became a second base of operations. Operating under the command of Mariño, Piar and Carlos Soublette the republican expeditionaries captured more coastal towns. On July 14 Bolívar led an assault against Ocumare de la Costa, which ended in a debacle in which Bolívar abandoned Mariño, Piar and the rest of his forces, and fled by sea. Piar's forces managed to fight their way from the Caribbean coast to the southern Llanos, where the vast and underpopulated terrain and the forces forming under José Antonio Páez protected them from the royalist army. Mariño retreated to his home province of Cumaná, where he could rely on personal connections to maintain a base of operations. After failing to find support along the coast, Bolívar returned to Haiti. In the intervening months the divided republican leaders unable to agree on a single leader, decided to compromise and in October offered Bolívar the military command, with the understanding that a separate civilian government would be formed. In Haiti Bolívar gathered new supplies and organized a second expedition, named by history as the Jacmel Expedition for the city from which it departed, and on December 31, 1816, landed in Barcelona controlled by Mariño, who by this point barely accepted Bolívar as head of the republicans.\n\nBolívar took the forces he brought from Haiti to the Orinoco region, which was mostly controlled by Piar. Piar was making headway against the royalists of Angostura, and was preparing to lay siege to the city. The siege proved difficult and long, since Angostura had a lifeline in the river itself. Bolívar's reinforcements were useful and the city fell in August 1817. Angostura proved to be an immensely valuable base. From it the republicans had access to foreign trade in Caribbean and beyond via the Orinoco. The river's tributaries also provided access to the Venezuelan and New Granadan Llanos to the west, especially those in Casanare, where refugees from Morillo's troops had organized themselves under Francisco de Paula Santander. In Angostura Bolívar began publishing the \"Correo del Orinoco\" newspaper, an official organ of the revolutionaries, which was circulated not only in Venezuela, but in the Caribbean and in Europe. Under Páez and Piar, the republican armies had begun to recruit the local \"llaneros\" who, after Morillo disbanded Boves's informal units, no longer had an outlet for quick enrichment and social advancement under the royalist banner. This, however, posed the challenge to the Criollo republican leaders of channeling the \"llanero's\" energy, while not re-igniting the race war that had occurred under Boves. In this environment leaders like Piar, who in recent years had begun to emphasize his Pardo roots as he built a Pardo and \"llanero\" following, became suspect, and this weakness proved useful to Bolívar, when the moment came to reassert his position as head of the nascent republic.\n\nThe first overt challenge to his rule came with the meeting of the \"Congresillo of Cariaco\" on May 8 and 9 under the auspices of Canon José Cortés de Madariaga—who had been a member of the Junta of Caracas and had just returned to Venezuela after being imprisoned in Spain—Luis Brión and Santiago Mariño. The eight-member Congress proposed to restore the 1811 Constitution and establish a permanent government that could negotiate a recognition by other nations. Mariño offered his and Bolívar's resignation in order to allow the Congress to elect a new executive. The Congress restored the triumvirate and selected Fernando Rodríguez del Toro (who was at the moment exiled in Trinidad), Francisco Javier Mayz (one of the eight deputies of the Congress) and Simón Bolívar as the new triumvirate. To replace in an interim manner the two who were not present, the Congress chose Francisco Antonio Zea and Canon Cortés de Madariaga. It made Mariño general-in-chief of the republican forces and established La Asunción as the temporary capital of the Republic. It sent word to Bolívar to present himself as soon as military conditions permitted to take his place in the triumvirate. Less than a month later, Rafael Urdaneta and Antonio José de Sucre, who remained loyal to Bolívar, lead a group of officers that forced the triumvirate to dissolve itself. By June, Bolívar, aware of its rise and fall, compared its existence to \"cassava bread in hot soup\" and noted that at the moment in Venezuela only those who could command by force could truly do so.\n\nIt was clear to Bolívar by mid-1817 that he need to set a clear example that he would not tolerate challenges to his leadership. After the fall of Angostura Piar had become upset at Bolívar's leadership and decided to leave the area. He requested a passport from Bolívar, which he granted. Piar had begun to leave the area, when Bolívar changed his mind and accused Piar of plotting to kill all whites in the area and setting up a black and Mulatto republic (a \"pardocracia\") in imitation of Haiti. Piar was tracked down, court-martialed and found guilty. On October 16 he was executed. Although Piar's crime had ostensibly been fomenting racial hatred, it was understood that his true crime had been not recognizing Bolívar authority. After Piar's execution, Mariño, whom Bolívar's confidant and chronicler Daniel Florencio O'Leary later admitted had been more guilty of insubordination than Piar, fell in line and dropped any other pretensions to an independent leadership.\n\nHis political position secured, Bolívar began to expand the scope of his military activity. He met with Páez for the first time in January 1818, who accepted Bolívar as head of the republicans. Páez, however, refused to take his powerful \"llanero\" cavalry outside of the Llanos, where they were extremely effective in holding off and defeating Morillo's formal army. Bolívar was, therefore, left alone in a mid-year attempt to take Caracas, which failed. Nevertheless, by the end of the year, the republicans were secure enough in southern Venezuela, that Bolívar felt it was time to convene a new Venezuelan congress to give the republican government a permanent form. Elections were held in republican areas and to pick representatives of the provinces of Venezuela and New Granada under royalist control, among the troops of those areas. The Congress of Angostura, consisting of twenty-six delegates, began holding sessions in February 1819. The highlight of the opening session was Bolívar's \"Address at the Congress of Angostura\", now seen along with his \"Cartagena Manifesto\" and \"Jamaica Letter\" as a foundational exposition of his political thought. The same day the Congress elected Bolívar president of the Republic and ratified his command of its armies.\n\nAfter the opening of the Congress, Bolívar conceived of a daring, yet risky, plan of attacking New Granada which had been a Spanish stronghold for the past three years. If he could liberate New Granada he would have a whole new base from which to operate against Morillo. Central New Granada held great promise since, unlike Venezuela, it had only been recently conquered by Morillo and it had a prior six-year experience of independent government. Royalist sentiment was not strong. But it would be hard to take the initiative against the better prepared and supplied royalist army. To surprise it, Bolívar decided to move during the Venezuelan \"invierno\", the rainy season, when the Llanos flooded up to a meter and the campaign season ended. Morillo's forces would be evacuated from the Llanos for months and no one would anticipate that Bolívar's troops would be on the move. This decision, however, would mean literally wading in waist-deep, malarial water for days before attempting to scale the Andes. Understandably the plan received little support from the Congress or even from the master of the Llanos himself, Páez. With only the forces he and Santander had recruited in the Apure and Meta River regions, Bolívar set off in June 1819.\nThe small army consisted of about 2,500 men: 1,300 infantry and 800 cavalry, including a British legion. It took a route that went from the hot and humid, flood-swept plains of Colombia to the icy mountain pass of the Páramo de Pisba, at an altitude of 3,960 meters (13,000 feet), through the Cordillera Oriental. After the hardships of wading through a virtual sea, the mostly \"llanero\" army scaled the mountains poorly clothed and ill-prepared for the cold and altitude of the mountains. On both legs of the trip many became ill or died. Despite some intelligence that Bolívar was on the move, the Spanish considered the route impassable, and therefore, they were taken by surprise when Bolívar's small army emerged from the mountains on July 5. In a series of battles under the auspices of Francisco Mariño y Soler the republican army cleared its way to Bogotá. First at the Battle of Vargas Swamp on July 25, Bolívar intercepted a royalist force attempting to reach the poorly defended capital. Then at the Battle of Boyacá on August 7, the bulk of the royalist army surrendered to Bolívar. On receiving the news, the viceroy, Juan José de Sámano, and the rest of royalist government fled the capital so fast that they left behind the treasury, an incredible coup for Bolívar and Santander. On August 10 Bolívar's army entered Bogotá.\n\nWith New Granada secure under Santander's control, Bolívar could return to Venezuela in a position of unprecedented military, political and financial strength. In his absence the Congress had flirted with deposing him, assuming that he would meet his death in New Granada. The vice-president Francisco Antonio Zea was deposed and replaced by Juan Bautista Arismendi. All this was quickly reversed when word got to the Congress of Bolívar's success. By year's end Bolívar presented himself before the Congress and asked it to decree the union of Venezuela and New Granada in a new state, Colombia. It did so on December 17 and elected him president of the new country. The Constitution that the Congress had just written for Venezuela became null and void and a new congress was set to convene within two years.\n\n1820 proved to be a banner year for Bolívar. His dream of creating a new nation was becoming a reality. Morillo no longer had the upper hand militarily and by late March reports began to arrive about the success of the Riego Revolt. The revolt meant that the reinforcements that Morillo's expeditionary force desperately needed would not be coming. Moreover, in June the official orders to reinstate the Cádiz Constitution arrived and were implemented. The new Constitutional government in Spain radically changed policy towards the rebellions in America. It assumed that the revolutionaries, as liberals, were either fighting for, or could be co-opted by, the Spanish Constitution. Although this might have been true in parts of Spanish America at the start of the decade, by 1820 most Spanish Americans did not trust Fernando VII to keep his oath to the Constitution for long. More importantly, it had always been Bolívar's stance that the wars were between two sovereign states, and therefore, the question of reconciling with the Spanish Monarchy under the 1812 Constitution was never a consideration.\n\nDespite this, Morillo continued with negotiations and focused on getting a ceasefire and bringing the war in line with the law of nations. This was achieved in two treaties signed on November 25 and 26 in Santa Ana de Trujillo, which established a six-month cessation of hostilities and regularized the rules of engagement. The negotiations were also important because the Spanish government for the first time tacitly granted Colombia national status, rather than seeing its representatives as mere rebels. Spain did not of course recognize Colombia, but the negotiations papers referred to it as such, rather than with the previous denominations of \"Bolívar's forces\" or \"the Congress at Angostura.\" The ceasefire allowed Bolívar to build up his army for the final showdown everyone knew was coming. By the end of the year, the Constitutional government granted Morillo his long-standing request to resign and he left South America. He was replaced by Miguel de la Torre.\n\nThe truce did not last all six months. On January 28 the \"cabildo\" of Maracaibo, which had been in secret negotiations with the republicans aided by native son Rafael Urdaneta, declared the province an independent republic, which chose to join Colombia. La Torre took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed, when Bolívar returned to Venezuela in April 1821, leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela, save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Hostilities continued until the surrender of Puerto Cabello in 1823, but the main front of the war now moved to southern New Granada and Quito.\n\nWith the Spanish Monarchy collapsing in South America and the uncertainty of constitutional rule in Spain, provinces of the Presidency of Quito began to declare independence. In October 1820 a coup in Guayaquil set up a junta, which declared Guayaquil a republic. Portoviejo and Cuenca followed suit in the next few weeks. Quito remained in royalist control under the Audiencia President, Field Marshal Melchior Aymerich, and by January 1821 had defeated the forces sent by Guayaquil against it. Bolívar was determined to ensure that the Presidency of Quito become part of Gran Colombia and not remain a collection of small, divided republics. To this end, Colombian aid in the form of supplies and an army under Antonio José de Sucre began to arrive in Guayaquil in February. Throughout 1821 Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides were exhausted and signed a 90-day armistice. The following year, at Battle of Pichincha on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito. The territory of New Granada was secure. From Puerto Cabello royalist make a counterattack at Battle of Lake Maracaibo. However the main focus now became neutralizing the royalist Army in Peru.\n\nJosé de San Martín had already made incursions into Peru starting in 1820. He had been declared Protector of Peruvian Freedom, in August 1821 after liberating parts of the country, but the important cities and provinces still remained royalist. Bolívar and San Martín held a meeting in Guayaquil on July 26 and 27, 1822, in which they discussed plans to liberate Peru and it was decided that Bolívar and Gran Colombia would take over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Martín departed from the scene. For the next two years Colombian and Peruvian patriot forces gain more territory. On February 10, 1824, Bolívar was given immense political powers when a Peruvian congress named him dictator of Peru, which made Bolívar the head of state of a second country and allowed Bolívar to completely reorganize the political and military administration of Peru. Bolívar, assisted by Sucre, decisively defeated the remnants of the royalist cavalry on August 6, 1824, at the Battle of Junín. Sucre then destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the royalist army at Battle of Ayacucho on December 9. South American independence was now all but secured. The only royalist area in the continent was highland country of Upper Peru, El Callao and Chiloé.\n\n\"For details, see Bolivian War of Independence\"\n\nBolívar was now president of both Gran Colombia and Peru and had been granted extraordinary powers by the legislatures of both countries to carry out the war against the Spanish Monarchy. Since Bolívar was tied up with the administration of Quito and Peru, the liberation of Upper Peru fell to Sucre and O'Connor, and within a year in April 1825, the task had been completed. A congress of Upper Peru on August 6, 1825, chose to name the new nation after the Liberator and called it the Republic of Bolívar. (The name would later be changed to Bolivia.) With independence secured for all of Spanish South America, Bolívar's political life entered a new phase. He now had to turn to consolidating the large nations he had created out of the former Spanish provinces. And dissension began to brew in the north as the regions of Gran Colombia began to chafe under the centralized government.\n\nDuring 1826, internal divisions had sparked dissent throughout the nation and regional uprisings erupted in Venezuela, and Gran Colombia appeared to be on the verge of collapse. An amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the Venezuelan rebels, but political dissent appeared in New Granada as a consequence of this. In an attempt to keep the nation together, Bolívar called for a constitutional convention at Ocaña to be held in April 1828. To prevent the splintering of Gran Colombia, Bolívar proposed to introduce an even more centralist model of government, including some or all of the elements he had been able to place in the Bolivian constitution: a lifetime presidency with the ability to select a successor, and a hereditary third chamber of the legislature. These proposals were deemed anti-liberal and met with strong opposition, including from a faction forming around Santander, who by now was openly opposed to Bolívar politically.\n\nThe Convention of Ocaña (April 9 to June 10, 1828) met under a cloud. Many felt that the breakup of the country was imminent. Addressing these fears, the Congress went in the opposite direction that Bolívar had hoped, and drafted a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government with greatly reduced the powers for the central administration. Unhappy with this outcome, pro-Bolívar delegates left the convention and the constitution was never ratified.\n\nAfter the failure of the convention, Bolívar proclaimed himself dictator on August 27, 1828, through an Organic Decree of Dictatorship. He considered this as a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, though it only increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents. On September 25, 1828 an attempt to assassinate Bolívar failed, but it illustrated the tense political atmosphere in Gran Colombia. Although Bolívar emerged physically intact from the event, he was, nevertheless, greatly affected. Dissent continued, and new uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela and Quito during the next two years. Gran Colombia finally collapsed in 1830. Bolívar himself died in the same year at age 47 on December 17. His closest political ally at the time, Sucre, who was intending to retire from public life, had been murdered earlier on June 4, 1830.\n\nBolívar's legacy continued in the successor states to Gran Colombia. Many of the officers who had fought by him were not only involved in the revolts that led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia, but continued to play important political and military roles in the decades and wars that followed. Bolívar's political thought—his emphasis on a strong, centralized government—became the basis of conservative thought in nineteenth-century South America.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41072863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41072863", "title": "Richard Harrow", "text": "Richard Harrow\n\nRichard Harrow is a fictional character on the television series \"Boardwalk Empire\" played by actor Jack Huston.\n\nRichard Harrow was a sharp shooter in the US Army during World War I. He was badly disfigured during the war, losing his eye, upper jaw and most of the cheekbone on the left side of his face. He has also suffered some throat damage which causes him to speak in a low, muffled voice. Because of his appearance, Harrow wears a tin mask in public that was molded to mirror the intact right side of his face.\n\nAfter the war he returned to Wisconsin where his twin sister, Emma, cared for him while his wounds healed. Once he was able to care for himself he left to live in Chicago.\n\nRichard meets fellow veteran Jimmy Darmody (Michael Pitt) in an army hospital in Chicago, and they become fast friends. To prove his loyalty, Richard kills a local gangster who had disfigured a young prostitute with whom Jimmy was close. Jimmy invites Richard to stay with him and his family, and brings him into his bootlegging outfit.\n\nRichard accompanies Jimmy back to New Jersey, where he becomes a hit man working for Jimmy under Atlantic City political boss Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi). Richard then moves into the Thompson home where he acts as a bodyguard to Nucky, his companion Margaret Schroeder (Kelly Macdonald) and her two small children. At first Margaret and her children are frightened by Richard's appearance, but they eventually warm up to him.\n\nRichard is now established as the right hand man on Jimmy's bootlegging crew. Jimmy and Richard have now gone into business with Charlie \"Lucky\" Luciano (Vincent Piazza), Meyer Lansky (Anatol Yusef) and Al Capone (Stephen Graham). Richard has also moved into the Darmody household, where he befriends Jimmy's wife Angela (Aleksa Palladino). Angela, a painter, asks Richard if she can do his portrait; he reluctantly agrees. During their session, Richard confides in Angela that he and his sister have not spoken since he left home. Richard then voluntarily removes his mask, and she paints his portrait.\n\nRichard ventures out into a secluded forest during a remembrance day memorial, intending to commit suicide. As he puts a shotgun in his mouth, a hunter's dog runs off with his tin mask. Richard chases the dog, and finds two hunters sitting around a campfire, who convince him to keep on living.\n\nRichard serves as Jimmy's lieutenant throughout a turf war with Nucky, and remains loyal even as they suffer serious financial losses. Richard is deeply saddened by Angela's death at the hands of Philadelphia gangster Manny Horvitz (William Forsythe), and begins to wonder if their business is worth the price they pay. \n\nTo mend fences with Nucky, Richard and Jimmy go to Alderman James Neary (Robert Clohessy), scheduled to testify against Nucky, force him to type a note at gunpoint exonerating Nucky, then Richard shoots him in the head and stages his death as a suicide. When Nucky calls Jimmy and says they have captured Horvitz, both Jimmy and Richard sense a trap, and Richard offers to go along. Jimmy refuses, however, and tells Richard to live a good life. After Jimmy is murdered, Richard moves in with Jimmy's mother Gillian (Gretchen Mol) at her estate.\n\nOne year later, Richard is a permanent resident at the late Commodore's estate, which Gillian has since turned into a brothel. Richard now acts as a caretaker at the brothel, and looks after Jimmy's son Tommy. Richard seeks vengeance on Manny Horvitz, who is now a member of Nucky's organization, for the death of Angela. Richard waits outside the Horvitz home and then shoots Horvitz in the face with a shotgun as he opens the door to leave his house.\n\nRichard ventures off one evening to a veteran's legion for support and to discuss compensation which has been promised to wounded veterans. It's here that Richard meets Paul Sagorsky (Mark Borkowski), a bitter drunk who lost his son in the war. Richard looks after Paul when he is injured in a bar fight, and meets Paul's daughter Julia (Wrenn Schmidt). He falls in love with her, and they begin a courtship, despite her father's objections. \n\nLater in the season, Gillian's brothel is occupied by New York gangster Gyp Rosetti (Bobby Cannavale), who is at war with Nucky Thompson. Fearing for Tommy's safety, Richard attempts to remove the boy to Julia's house, but Gillian finds out about the plan and, angered, she has Rosetti's men kick Richard out. Richard arms himself and methodically kills most of Rossetti's men one by one through the house, recovering Tommy, whom he leaves at the Sagorsky home. Richard then flees Atlantic City.\n\nOne year later, Richard makes his way to his childhood home in Wisconsin to visit his twin sister Emma (Katherine Waterston). Richard returns home to find Emma widowed, pregnant and in debt. During his visit with his sister, Richard finds it difficult to put down the family dog. During this time Richard is tracked down by a former client who had hired Richard previously to carry out an assassination contract that was not honored. They corner Richard in the barn; during the ensuing struggle, Richard kills one of the gangsters, but the other one breaks Richard's hand and nearly kills him. Emma arrives just in time and kills the gangster, saving Richard's life. Richard realizes he is a danger to his sister and decides to go back to Atlantic City.\n\nUpon returning to Atlantic City, Richard bumps into Paul Sagorsky, who is dying of cirrhosis of the liver. Richard finds out that Julia and Paul are locked in a custody battle with Gillian over Tommy. Richard returns to the Sagorsky's home to help Julia, whom he marries. To provide for his new family, Richard gets a job washing dishes at the Onyx Club, with the help of Nucky.\n\nWhen Gillian is arrested for murder, Richard and Julia see an opportunity to get permanent custody of Tommy. Gillian claims that the body found on her estate was that of her son, Jimmy, and with the body having been cremated, there is no way to prove otherwise. In order to undermine her story, Richard asks Nucky for the location where Jimmy's body is actually buried. Nucky agrees to tell Richard, but for a price: he must eliminate New York gangster Dr. Valentine Narcisse (Jeffrey Wright), who is causing problems for Nucky and his associate Chalky White (Michael K. Williams). As he prepares to shoot Narcisse, he hesitates and his hand shakes, and he accidentally kills White's daughter Maybelle when she unexpectedly steps into the line of fire. Richard is mortally wounded in the ensuing gunfire, but manages to make his way to the Atlantic City Boardwalk, where he dies. His dying visions show him returning to the farm in Wisconsin to meet his entire family, with his face complete and healed.\n\nJack Huston was interviewed by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. Huston stated that he was told that his character was going to die on the episode of Harrow's death. Huston stated that it was very appropriate for Harrow, a tragic character, to die tragically. Being honored instead of upset about the ending, Huston claimed that the writers wrote \"the most unbelievably beautiful ending, and it made so much sense.\" Glad to have played a longer-than-initially-expected role in \"Boardwalk Empire\", Huston stated that it was the start of his career in acting. Terence Winter said that if Harrow was not fatally wounded after shooting Maybelle, then Harrow would have committed suicide. Huston agrees that Harrow would have done that, for fact of killing Maybelle would be unforgivable in Harrow's mind. Huston stated that at first \"Richard was a brilliant killer\"; then he gives up killing, losing confidence; later, he was intuitive and expected himself to err; after shooting Maybelle he hesitates, allowing himself to be shot. Huston posited that Harrow's scrapbook became a reality: he fell in love, married, and had a family. Regarding Harrow's vision at the end of his life, Huston stated \"In a way he reached heaven in his life.\"\n\n"}

He was known as the \"crate boy\" for Jazzy Jay, who was the DJ for Afrika Bambaataa. He later claimed that Bambaata sexually molested him.\n\nGrowing up in the Castle Hill Houses in The Bronx, Savage was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome as well as epilepsy. He became a member of the Universal Zulu Nation at the age of 14. Savage used to spend time with D.J Jazzy Jay while he recorded records in the early 1980s. Savage states, \"The best time I had in hip hop, when I was a kid was being paid after the parties, we were being paid [by Bambaataa] in White Castles Hamburgers\".\n\nSavage got his start in the music industry in 1986 when Jazzy Jay built his recording studio in the Bronx on Blondel Ave. He paid his dues by running errands for Jazzy. In 1986, Jazzy Jay teamed up with Rocky Bucano to start Strong City Records. Soon, Jazzy moved the label to Allenton Ave in the Bronx, where Savage convinced the DJ's to play records of Strong City artists on rap radio and in rap clubs. soon after in 1988 Strong City Records was acquired by MCA Records to become Strong City / MCA / Uni Records. There, Savage worked on Strong City Record acts such as Busy Bee Starski, Def Duo, Ultimate Force, Ice Cream Tee, Nu Sounds, BZ2 M.C.'s, and other groups like Brand Nubian, Showbiz & A.G, Fat Joe, which all worked out of Jazzy Jay Studios. \n\nA few years later, he left Strong City Records and began working for Dick Scott Entertainment the management company for the New Kids on The Block, Marky Mark, Boys to Men. At Dick Scott Entertainment, Savage worked as an artist liaison for the rap group Snap! whose single \"I Got The Power\" went #1 on the weekly charts in Spain, UK, Netherlands, Switzerland, as well as the Eurochart Hot 100. In 1990 the song hit #2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Savage also handled for Dick Scott Entertainment other groups as Doug E Fresh, Ikey Cee, and Show Biz & A.G. In 1990 while working with the rap pop group SNAP Ronald \"Bee-Stinger\" Savage carved the term Six elements of the Hip Hop Movement. The Six Elements Of The Hip Hop Movement are: Consciousness Awareness, Civil Rights Awareness, Activism Awareness, Justice, Political Awareness, Community Awareness. \nWhile working as an artist liaison at Dick Scott Entertainment, he suffered a mild stroke from the constant stress at his job which ended his career in the music industry.

In 2008, Savage was elected to the New York State Democratic Committee with the help of former NYS Assemblyman Peter M Rivera. Savage was honored by the NAACP with an award in recognition of his devotion and commitment and uplifting youth in the community. Ronald Savage is also the founder of the New York State College Fair Day.

Savage also stated in an interview in London, \"I don’t recognize the term hip hop Culture because that is a term Bambaataa coined and I don’t know what his intention was when he coined the term, but what I do recognize is hip hop and I salute the rebirth of the hip hop movement\".\n"}
{"id": "2274728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274728", "title": "Siegfried and Nightmare", "text": "Siegfried and Nightmare\n\nSiegfried is a young German knight that, driven mad after killing his father, becomes possessed by the evil sword Soul Edge and physically transforms into the demon known as Nightmare. Though Siegfried does temporarily regain his sanity after Nightmare is defeated by Xianghua in \"Soulcalibur\" (only to be taken over by Soul Edge again shortly after), it is not until after the events of \"Soulcalibur II\" that he is freed from the sword's control entirely and went on to pierce the cursed sword using Soul Calibur. He then seeks atonement for the atrocities he committed as Nightmare. In their final confrontation in \"Soulcalibur IV\", Siegfried successfully destroyed Soul Edge and freed himself from the evil power.\n\nNightmare first appeared in one of the possible endings for the Siegfried character in \"Soul Edge\". In the sequel \"Soulcalibur\", he was given a name and featured as a central character. Ever since then, Nightmare has been the owner of the powerful evil sword Soul Edge, and thus the objective of most other characters in the story. Appearing in every game of the series, Nightmare has served as a recurring antagonist in contrast to the protagonist role played by Siegfried, as well as serving as Siegfried's archenemy.\n\nIn his \"Soul Edge\" debut, Siegfried is a 16-year-old former child of Frederick Schtauffen, a brave knight in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation following the Italian Wars. Named by his mother after the legendary Germanic hero Sigurd, Siegfried had joined a band of brigands called the Schwarzwind after his father has had left on a foreign crusade, only to unintentionally kill his own returning father during an ambush. Driven insane by this act, Siegfried convinced himself that someone else was to blame for his father's death, thus embarking on a journey to find the legendary weapon known as Soul Edge and use it to take revenge. \n\nHe traveled first to Ostrheinsburg Castle belonging to the noble Stefan, who he believed to be the possessor of Soul Edge; and he joined in its forces as a Landsknecht, rising in its ranks with the hopes of acquiring Stefan's blade. During a siege on the castle, Siegfried saw an opportunity to kill Stefan, running off with his prized possession into the Black Woods, but the sword held no power. Frustrated, he continued to search for the real Soul Edge, growing increasingly more insane for its power as time passed. He finally managed to come across the real Soul Edge, lying beside the corpse of the corrupted pirate Cervantes de Leon that lit up in a hellish blaze of fire and attacked him. Siegfried raised his mighty zweihänder and defeated his lingering spirit, the fiery demon Inferno, breaking his sword in the process and earning the right to wield the Soul Edge for himself. But at the moment that Siegfried obtained the cursed blade, the Evil Seed emanated from him in a beam of light that rained across the entire world, leading only to death and destruction. Soul Edge tempted Siegfried to wield it with a promise to resurrect his dead father in exchange for gathering souls for its consumption. Not knowing that he is just being used, Siegfried agreed and started killing people to gather souls. Eventually, Soul Edge consumed him and Nightmare is borns, transforming him into the Azure Knight. \n\nIn \"Soulcalibur Legends\", Siegfried is saved from the Evil Seed by a group sent by the Masked Emperor to investigate it. Once brought to him, the Emperor requested that he resurrect Soul Edge to defeat the Ottoman Sultan Barbaros, who wielded Soul Calibur. The Emperor reminded the reluctant Siegfried of his father - who lived in the Empire's service and died protecting it - and he finally accepted the request, starting a journey alongside Ivy Valentine and court jester Iska Farkas. Siegfried travels around the world, gathering Soul Edge's shards and receiving help from Sophitia, Astaroth, Mitsurugi, Taki and Lloyd Irving, eventually forming a bond with them, despite the fact that they all wish to either take Soul Edge away from him or destroy it. Along the way, Siegfried manages to defeat several Guardians of the Soul Edge shards and restore Soul Edge's power. Using it, Siegfried defeats Barbaros. The Masked Emperor gets Soul Calibur and reveals that she planned to defend her people by annihilating all possible enemies with the combined powers of it and Soul Edge. However, she is unsuccessful in seizing Soul Edge from Siegfried, and an event seemingly similar to the Evil Seed takes place during their battle. He defeats Inferno when the demon tries to stop him in the form of Nightmare and succeeds in sealing Soul Edge, replacing it with the sword Requiem. Siegfried saves his allies, and together they march against the Empire's army. He confronts and defeats the Masked Emperor and stop her conquest. As he leaves her, Soul Calibur, and Soul Edge behind, Iska betrays him and takes both swords but Siegfried emerges victorious. As Iska dies he exclaims that in the end all will betray Siegfried and that only those with power will prevail in the end, leaving those without it to suffer and ultimately die. As Siegfried leaves, he takes the unsealed Soul Edge with him again.\n\nIn \"Soulcalibur\", his group of followers (Astaroth, Aeon Calcos, and Ivy) aided him in Soul Edge's quest to devour souls for a resurrection ceremony to be performed in his chosen stronghold, Ostrheinsburg. But as the ceremony was about to take place, both Aeon Calcos and Astaroth have been defeated, and Ivy had left after learning the truth of her past from Taki. Two young warriors confronted Nightmare: Kilik and Xianghua. After a raging battle, the evil sword shattered and Siegfried regained some of his humanity and managed to briefly break free from Soul Edge's control. But along came the memories of the sins he committed when he was consumed by Soul Edge. Moreover, he realized that he had been the one who murdered his father, and that his \"resurrection\" was only an illusion brought by his mind. Siegfried meditated on all he had done and decided that if he was to be successful in his new resolve, he must distance himself from the civilized society so that he never kills again. He could not see his mother until he was fully redeemed.\n\nBy \"Soulcalibur II\", the balance between the restored Soul Edge and Siegfried was broken, and Soul Edge was able to take over Siegfried's mind. He has been well aware that although he had regained his sanity and learned to accept his past sins, he was not yet fully redeemed. At first it was for short periods of time during his sleep, but eventually he took Siegfried's body completely and used him to cause destruction once more. Four years passed, as he had assumed the azure armor for a second time, becoming Nightmare all over again, desperately pursuing fragments of the Soul Edge that he might fully restore it. As Nightmare plundered powerful souls and recovered shattered fragments, the cracks in Soul Edge healed one by one. His goal nearing completion, Nightmare returned to Ostrheinsburg for the restoration of the evil sword's true power. Raphael Sorel, a French former-nobleman pursuing the blade for his own scheme, challenged Nightmare and was completely defeated, but managed to pierce Soul Edge's eye with his rapier in one final attack when Siegfried's will awakened and he struggled to free his mind from the influence of evil. The sword now in agony lost control over Siegfried, and allowed him to defeat Inferno and break free once again. Siegfried then discovered Soul Calibur, released from Inferno's body after its defeat, and impaled Soul Edge's eye with it. Both swords sealed, Siegfried abandoned his old armor and left with them, swearing to seal away Soul Edge for all eternity and atone for his sins. \n\nHis fate would not release him so easily, however. In \"Soulcalibur III\", Zasalamel revived \"Nightmare\" in essence. Created as an avatar for a disembodied Inferno using the original armor as a shell, he pursued and eventually recovered his true body, Soul Edge. Nightmare also met Tira, who became his servant and manipulated others into protecting Soul Edge and sacrificing souls for Nightmare, to eventually become sacrifices themselves. Meanwhile, Zasalamel manipulated Siegfried, leading him to Nightmare, and wielding Soul Calibur, he clashed against Soul Edge. At the moment the swords struck a burst of energy was released; Siegfried was mortally wounded, while Soul Edge and its body were pulled into a warped dimension, eventually returning to Ostrheinsburg. \n\nIn \"Soulcalibur IV\", Soul Calibur revived Siegfried, while Inferno restored Soul Edge fully and strengthened his hold over the animated armor that was Nightmare. Inferno then claimed the entire city of Ostrheinsburg as a vessel due to the fact that Nightmare lacked the capacity to contain his consciousness, and as a result, the city became cursed and many of its inhabitants were corrupted. Tira continued serving Nightmare and manipulating Astaroth, Sophitia and others into serving Soul Edge, in order to weaken Soul Calibur and provide Nightmare with the strength necessary to destroy the spirit sword. Nightmare would then clash against Siegfried in a final duel, though his plans were interfered with the appearance of Algol and the Tower of Remembrance. \n\nAs revealed in \"Soulcalibur V\", Siegfried gathered his staunchest allies from the Schwarzwind, having reformed the bandits into mercenaries, including Hildegard von Krone and Viola. One day, after more than a decade of service protecting humanity from the malfested, Siegfried discovered that Soul Calibur had transformed into a new one-handed sword—a clear harbinger of Soul Edge's return. A new champion to wield Soul Calibur would need to be found and the now 40-year-old Siegfried assigned the task to the young Z.W.E.I., a wandering swordsman who had joined his group. Meanwhile, Soul Edge regained consciousness with what little pieces of it were found and collected by its servants; allowing Nightmare to gain a new body and assume the alias of Graf Dumas. From there, Dumas worked his way into the grace of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to be awarded the Kingdom of Hungary, exploiting the war with the Ottomans to initiate a widespread search to find the remaining fragments to restore Soul Edge to its former glory, while simultaneously wanted to consume more souls under the guise of massacring the \"malfested\", the cursed sword's minions. Unknown to him however, his former servant, Tira had been working to create a new Nightmare as she is not satisfied with Dumas. One of his soldier, Patroklos Alexander; whom he manipulated for the massacre in exchange for searching his sister Pyrrha, revolted and fled from service. Dumas eventually met with Patroklos and Pyrrha again; this time revealing himself as Nightmare, and forced Pyrrha's hidden Soul Edge power to consume her, causing Patroklos to abandon her. Nightmare then initiated a war throughout Europe with his newfound power, but is eventually struck down and killed by Z.W.E.I., whom he previously tried to hunt before. Though after Pyrrha Omega kills Z.W.E.I., Inferno made her his new host for Soul Edge,but was eventually defeated by Patrokalos and together the siblings use Soul Edge to Piece Soul Calibur and sealing them back into the Astral Chaos. \n\nSiegfried also appeared playable in \"\", where he is 40-years-old. \n\n\"Soulcalibur VI\" serves as a retelling of the events in the original \"Soulcalibur\". Shortly after becoming Nightmare, Siegfried slaughters thousands of innocents in an attempt to resurrect his father, with Soul Edge mimicking Frederick's voice to manipulate Siegfried. Nightmare is eventually defeated by Kilik and Xianghua. After the Azure Knight's defeat, Siegfried reawakens in a nearby forest wracked with guilt over his memories of his atrocities as Nightmare and his role in his father's death. After facing off against multiple people who want revenge on him for Nightmare's crimes, his soul is partially purified by Sophitia, giving him the motivation to take down Soul Edge for good. After hearing the voice of Soul Calibur cry for help, he grips Soul Edge and becomes Nightmare once more to prevent Soul Edge from consuming Soul Calibur. He then waits for his chance to regain control of his body once more.\n\nOutside of the \"Soul\" series, Nightmare appeared in \"Seme COM Dungeon: Drururuaga\" where the player can obtain him as an \"ally\" and use his armor along with Soul Edge. Soul Edge also appeared as an enemy in \"Namco x Capcom\" where its shards became Charade and was fought as enemies, and made a cameo in \"Retro Game Challenge\". A Sackboy costume of Nightmare was released as a DLC for \"LittleBigPlanet 3\".\n\nIn 2000, Epoch C-Works released a series of action figures based upon the original \"Soulcalibur\", amongst them Nightmare. The semi-posable figure came with equipable weapons from the title in the same package. In 2003, Todd McFarlane Productions released a Nightmare sculpture amongst a set of five based on characters from \"Soulcalibur II\". The immobile figure was modeled after his primary outfit and stood six inches tall with a base. In the web series \"Death Battle\", Nightmare fought Guts, the protagonist from \"Berserk\", in his standard, Night Terror, and Inferno forms. He lost as Guts was able to cut through Soul Edge in half. \n\nSiegfried and Nightmare both appear in \"Soulcalibur\" manga and make a guest appearance as cards in a mobile video game \"Outcast Odyssey\" and in many cards in \"Universal Fighting System\". They are also both featured on the official \"Soulcalibur VI\" arcade stick.\n\nIn his debut, Siegfried appeared as a young man with short blond hair and blue eyes, covered in simple knight armor. Following his redemption in \"Soulcalibur\" and beyond, he retains the armor but his hair has grown longer, past shoulder length. During \"Soulcalibur\"\" he also gains a long scar dashing over his right eye. In \"Soulcalibur III\", he returns with armor bearing the motif of a phoenix as well as feathers on his pauldrons. As of \"Soulcalibur IV\", his armor remains the same, but a second layer of crystalline armor covers with an intricate design and wields Soul Calibur instead of Requiem. He also gains a long blue scarf as well, completing the 'knight in shining armor' visage. His weapon in Soul Edge was originally Faust, a simple zweihander (two-handed sword) with a basic design, but swapped it for Requiem, a large blade with a flat end and a black lining in the center. He continues to use this sword from \"Soulcalibur\" all the way to \"Soulcalibur III\" and resumes its use in \"Soulcalibur V\". In \"Soulcalibur V\", Siegfried's appearance begins to take on the traits of his father, and has grown a stubble. His hair is swept up with a couple bangs hanging down and his scar still remains. In all games, he is left-handed.\n\nUsually a standalone character, Siegfried is an unlockable character in \"Soulcalibur.\" In \"Soulcalibur II\", he only appears as Nightmare's alternate costumes. The 2P costume is Siegfried mid-transition into Nightmare, featuring his human form with a grotesque dragon-like arm, a golden right eye and ruined armor based off his Soulcalibur design. Nightmare's bonus costume is Siegfried in standard platemail without any mutations to his body.\n\nEven though Nightmare originally debuted in \"Soulcalibur\", its predecessor, \"Soul Edge\", featured a prototype of his character. In the home version, an extra character named \"Siegfried!\" (an alternate version of normal Siegfried taken from his no-input ending, where he was consumed by the cursed sword Soul Edge) was added as an unlockable character. This early version has crimson armor and a more flesh-like design, almost as if he were part of Soul Edge itself; he has no story nor ending, and only used Siegfried's Soul Edge without effects. Nightmare has appeared as a playable character in all the main sequels to \"Soulcalibur\", visually different for each game. \n\nSiegfried's blade is powerful and has long range, but it has a slow swing. In addition to standard attacks, Siegfried fights with multiple stances. This allows him to mix up his attacks, allowing him to play mind games with his opponent. Mastering the stance changes will allow the player to maintain control over the battle and perform damaging combos against the opponent. 1UP.com recommended Siegfried in \"Soulcalibur IV\" for both beginners and experts of the series due to his easy combos despite his slow movements. \n\nNightmare's moveset before the events of \"Soulcalibur III\" was nearly identical to Siegfried's (barring a couple of exclusive moves in each moveset). However, Nightmare's fighting style was altered after Siegfried was freed from Inferno's influence between \"Soulcalibur II\" and \"Soulcalibur III\". Siegfried retained a majority of his old moveset while Nightmare's new moveset became a brutish twist of Siegfried's moveset. Nightmare's moveset relies far less on stances and mindgames and focuses more on overwhelming the opponent with strong blows and otherworldly might. As such, Siegfried is seen as a technical stance character focused on mindgames and mix ups while Nightmare is an aggressive rushdown character focused on punishing his opponent's mistakes with his raw power. Despite \"Soulcalibur VI\" being a reboot that takes place during the events of \"Soulcalibur\", Nightmare and Siegfried retain these differences in their movesets.\n\nInferno is the physical manifestation of the cursed sword Soul Edge's own soul and the true antagonist within \"Soul\" series, where it mostly started out as the final boss in \"Soul Edge\" (originally listed as \"SoulEdge\") until \"Soulcalibur II\", including the reboot/retelling game \"Soulcalibur VI\". It fights using the attack style of other fighters from its memories of past battles and will switch to a random one at the start of each round. Though it exists in its own dimension, Chaos (a realm where time and space never exist), it has used duplicity such as in the case of tricking Siegfried into expanding its will, and in more extreme cases utilized Cervantes' flaming corpse and later the remnants of Nightmare's armor to create an avatar for itself. Within Chaos, Inferno can manifest itself as a flaming and mostly skeletal body for itself, creating weapons to match whichever fighting style it currently uses, particularly Siegfried's being its primary likeness at most part. \n\nInferno, along with Soul Edge is destroyed by Siegfried at the end of \"Soulcalibur IV\", though its will continues to live in the leftover shards of Soul Edge and later manifests itself in a new Soul Edge. However, after the new Nightmare was slain, Inferno choose Pyrrha as its new host until being defeated by her brother and Soul Edge along with Soul Calibur were both sealed away in the astral chaos. Its will and power has, directly and indirectly, affected several other characters in the series, such as the Evil Seed event that caused many to turn somewhat evil or insane. It has also caused the creation of several life forms or modification of them, such as Ivy's sword, Charade, Necrid and Abyss.\n\nIn \"Soulcalibur VI\", Inferno's gameplay is similar to his original \"Soul Edge\" counterpart as being an enhanced version of certain Soul Edge wielders than as a mimic fighter, in this case, its main alter-ego Nightmare instead of Cervantes. Due to its final boss role despite being an unlockable character, Inferno is banned from online matches and official tournaments.\n\n is the secret final boss of \"Soulcalibur III\", replacing the normal final boss Abyss if certain requirements are met. Its appearance has been a mystery as it is not player-controllable, is given very little mention in-game (its profile only stated that it is the result of Soul Edge and Soul Calibur fusing with Nightmare's remains), and does not appear or mentioned in future games. The official artbook of \"Soulcalibur V\" mentions the creature as the personification of \"Catastrophe\" residing in Astral Chaos who is very powerful that even Soul Calibur's creator, Algol avoids confronting it for the time being.\n\nNight Terror utilizes a complete version of Soul Edge as its weapon with a fighting style simply referred to as \"Memories of Nightmare?\". It borrows many moves from Nightmare, albeit greatly amplified, including having greater range and power or becoming unblockable. Notably, Night Terror is the only character in the history of the series who cannot be defeated by ring outs; whenever it is knocked off the stage, it simply flies back using its wings.\n\nSiegfried's overall reception in the series has been positive. Outlets such as Eurogamer, Gameplanet and GamesRadar commented positively on his redesigns for \"Soulcalibur IV,\" and \"Soulcalibur VI\". IGN has too praised Siegfied for an appealing design and a powerful yet graceful fighting style while listing him together with Nightmare at a top of their top ten list for the series in 2008, where they both were called \"a perfect representation of the series' core conflict,\" and opining that \"a Soul game simply feels incomplete without an appearance by the warring personalities of Siegfried and Nightmare.\" In 2013, \"Complex\" ranked Siegfried/Nightmare the best character in the series, citing his duality as the reason that makes the character \"one of the most fascinating characters in the entire series.\" In a preview of \"Soulcalibur V\", Siliconera said the franchise would not be same without Siegfried or Nightmare. The Gamer listed him as the 12th most powerful \"Soulcalibur\" character in 2017, praising his role and impact in the series. \n\nGameAxis Unwired expressed mixed thoughts about the character in \"Legends\" due to the fact he is the only playable character at first as the rest are unlockable. Additionally, the lack of his relationship with Nightmare not being featured as usual earned criticism. Expressing disappointment by the lack of famous characters in \"Soulcalibur V\", GameSpy noted that at least Siegfried's return might at least encourage him to play the game, citing lack of interest with the new cast.\n\nNightmare has received praise both as an aspect of Siegfried and as a series villain, and has been described as \"one of the most memorable fighting-game villains in history.\" \"The New York Times\" noted his size and appearance alongside Astaroth's as standouts in the series, adding \"they offer characters made for the sort of player who would have preferred Sonny Liston to Muhammad Ali, or Shaquille O'Neal to Michael Jordan.\" Others have been critical of the character's strength, such as \"JIVE Magazine\" which described him as one of several \"total crutches for mediocre players\" in \"Soulcalibur II\".\n\nNightmare placed first in UGO.com's \"Top 11 SoulCalibur Fighters\" article, with the writers statement \"Was there ever really any question? Not for us...\" and praise for his strength and role as a \"badass, playable villain.\" IGN listed him as a character they wished to see in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" as a playable guest villain, though noted he was also \"too extreme\" for the series. In a later article on the \"Soul\" series itself, they noted \"a \"Soul\" game simply feels incomplete without an appearance by the warring personalities of Siegfried and Nightmare\", and praised the contrast between Siegfried's angelic figure and Nightmare's demonic form. In \"Game Informer\"s 2009 list of best fighting game characters, Nightmare placed second.\n\nIn a 2002 poll by Namco prior to the release of \"Soulcalibur II\" regarding their favorite character, Siegfried placed ninth with 2.5% of the tally, tied with Mitsurugi. In Bandai Namco's 2015 poll, Siegfried was voted the sixth most popular characters from the series, followed by Nightmare.\n\n"}
{"id": "3024853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3024853", "title": "Tobias Beecher", "text": "Tobias Beecher\n\nTobias Beecher is a main character on the television show \"Oz\", played by Lee Tergesen. He is one of only nine regular characters to survive the entire run of the show. The others are Bob Rebadow, Ryan O'Reily, Miguel Alvarez, Arnold \"Poet\" Jackson, Sister Peter Marie Reimondo, Tim McManus and Dr. Gloria Nathan.\n\nBeecher, a successful attorney and family man, is an alcoholic who hits and kills a nine-year-old girl while driving drunk. He is offered a plea bargain that would have allowed him to serve his sentence in a minimum security prison, but Beecher, not wanting to do any time at all, instead goes to trial seeking an acquittal. The effort fails and the judge, a family friend of the Beechers, decides to make an example of him and sentences him to 15 years in the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary (\"Oz\") with a chance for parole after four.\n\nBeecher's personal transformation forms a major part of the show's drama. Arriving in Oz without any street skills and having a naturally timid personality, he becomes an easy target for abuse and is hardened by his experiences. He later remarks that, in Oz, he \"became the man he always was and never knew\". Despite having done terrible things while in Oz, Beecher often tries to atone.\n\nBeecher quickly learns that he is out of his element when he witnesses fellow arrival Miguel Alvarez getting shanked right before entering Cell Block E, or \"Emerald City.\" He is roomed with monstrous inmate Simon Adebisi during his first week in the titular facility. Approaching him in friendship, fellow inmate Vernon Schillinger offers to be his new cellmate. Beecher, completely unaware that Schillinger is the leader of the Aryan Brotherhood, naively accepts the offer, only to be \"initiated\" into prison life when Schillinger rapes him and burns a swastika onto his right buttock. Beecher is routinely abused as the Brotherhood's sex slave, or \"prag\". In attempting to deal with the trauma, Beecher starts using heroin and develops an addiction. This is quickly noticed by prison psychologist Sister Peter Marie Reimondo, who arranges for Beecher to attend group drug counseling.\n\nIn preparation for a prison talent show, Schillinger has Beecher get a \"makeover\" from one of Em City's drag queens. At the show, Beecher sings a rendition of \"I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)\" while dressed in women's clothing and makeup. Among other tortures, Schillinger makes Beecher beg to have sex with his wife before a conjugal visit, forces him to eat pages of a law book, polish Schillinger's boots with his tongue, and orders him to tear up pictures of his family. In an attempt to reach him, Sister Pete arranges for Beecher to meet with the mother of his DUI victim. Beecher is too ashamed to speak, however, and the girl's mother angrily lashes out at him.\n\nEventually, Schillinger tires of Beecher and forces him to leave the cell wearing a Confederate Flag t-shirt. Beecher, fearing he will be killed by a black inmate, goes to Irish-American inmate Ryan O'Reily, who provides him with PCP. Beecher then seeks out Schillinger, smashes the acrylic glass wall of his cell, and sends a broken shard flying into his eye. Beecher almost commits suicide immediately afterward, but is restrained by guards and put in solitary confinement. After being released, he confronts Schillinger in the prison gym's basketball court. He assaults Schillinger, ties him down, then defecates upon him in front of other inmates. This earns him respect from inmates such as O'Reily, Alvarez, and even Adebisi. When a riot erupts in Em City, Beecher sides with O'Reily in the chaos, defending him from an attack by the Muslims, as neither belongs to any strong gangs.\n\nBeecher shares a cell with James Robson, an Aryan who tries to make Beecher perform oral sex on him. Beecher bites off the tip of Robson's penis, landing him in solitary. There, he is interviewed by Alvah Case, who is investigating the riot. Upon his release from isolation, Beecher threatens to manipulate Sister Pete's psychiatric reports to ruin Schillinger's chances at parole. Frightened, Schillinger tries to put a hit on Beecher. He resorts to blackmailing corrections officer Diane Whittlesey with knowledge that she had shot prisoner Scott Ross during the riot. Whittlesey reluctantly agrees to the hit if Schillinger will keep quiet. Beecher disappears and Schillinger subsequently meets with Whittlesey to see his dead body. Whittlesey reveals that she recorded their conversation. Schillinger is arrested for conspiracy to commit murder, lengthening his sentence.\n\nDespite Beecher's celebratory mood, his new cellmate, Augustus Hill, warns him that Schillinger will be out for revenge. McManus also forces Beecher to confront the judge who sentenced him; she expresses remorse for her ruling and apologizes to him. Beecher responds that she was right in her ruling, but adds that he can't forgive her. After Hill is transferred to a different cell, Beecher is paired with Chris Keller, a charming sociopath. Later, Beecher receives word that his wife has killed herself; Schillinger brags that the Aryans actually killed her and staged the death as a suicide. Beecher gradually finds he is attracted to Keller, only to learn that Keller is working with Schillinger. After driving Beecher to start drinking again, the two corner him with the help of an Aryan guard, Karl Metzger, and break his arms and legs.\n\nKeller discovers that he has genuinely fallen in love with Beecher, and is desperate to win back his trust. However, Beecher refuses to forgive him. Beecher then kills Metzger by sharpening his fingernails and slashing his throat. Later, Beecher stabs Keller shortly after his release from the infirmary. When Schillinger's son Andy is sent to Oz, Beecher befriends the young man and arranges to share a cell with him. While Beecher does not mistreat Andy, he leads Schillinger to believe that he is going to sleep with him. Moved by Beecher's kindness, Andy renounces his father and his white supremacist ideology. Schillinger arranges to have his own son killed, having him thrown in solitary and getting a prison guard to deliver heroin on which he overdoses. Beecher feels guilty for his part in Andy's death and, following advice from Muslim leader Kareem Saïd, resolves to beg forgiveness from Keller and Schillinger. Beecher finally forgives Keller after saving him from Schillinger's attack and the two reunite as lovers.\n\nBeecher tries to bury the hatchet with Schillinger further by having a private investigator at his father's law firm search for his younger son Hank. However, Schillinger thinks Beecher was trying to turn Hank against him and orders his son to kidnap Beecher's children. Hank severs the hand of Beecher's son and mails it to him in Oz. Hank kills Beecher's son before ultimately releasing his daughter. Schillinger also pays another prisoner to tell Beecher that Keller is responsible for the kidnapping. Enraged, Beecher tries to kill Keller. When Beecher learns the truth, he tries to apologize to Keller, but Keller casts him aside. Upon learning that Hank has been acquitted due to a legal technicality, he approaches Chucky Pancamo in order to commission a hit. Beecher has second thoughts and tries to cancel the hit, only to learn that Hank is already dead.\n\nWhen Schillinger learns of Hank's death, he plots revenge — all chance of which is lost after Keller falsely confesses to having hired the hitman. Keller does so to make himself Schillinger's target instead of Beecher, and is transferred to Massachusetts not long afterwards. Beecher and Schillinger then are involved in a victim-attacker interaction program led by Sister Pete, who is trying to help Beecher fight his inner conflicts. With Keller in Massachusetts for confessing to Hank's murder, Beecher is up for parole and falls in love with his attorney, Katherine McClain. McClain does what she can for Beecher, but he is denied parole. Later that day in the library, Schillinger and Robson come by to taunt Beecher. Before they can harm him, Saïd appears and stabs them both.\n\nFearing a war between the Aryans and Muslims, Sister Pete suggests Beecher act as a mediator between Schillinger and Saïd. In the first mediation, Beecher says that Saïd and Schillinger are very alike despite drastic differences in beliefs. Pancamo informs Beecher that Agent Pierce Taylor has implicated him in Hank's murder, and will likely inform Schillinger that Pancamo arranged the hit of his son. Shortly after, Keller is transferred back to Oz and, now suspected of a series of murders, is isolated from the general population and Beecher. During another mediation in which homosexuality is discussed, Beecher attacks Schillinger when he denies ever raping him. Afterwards, convicted rapists Franklin Winthrop and Adam Guenzel arrive in Oz, the latter being a friend of Beecher's family. Beecher, fearing for Guenzel's safety, recruits the Italians to protect him. Schillinger forces Winthrop, now a prag for the Aryans, to tell the homophobic Guenzel about Beecher's past relationships with men and spread false rumors about the pair.\n\nSchillinger offers to let Beecher reunite with Keller if he convinces McManus to transfer Guenzel to a cell block where the Italians won't protect him. Beecher initially refuses, but gives in when Guenzel assaults and humiliates Beecher. Beecher later finds a bloodied Guenzel in the gym following his gang rape by the Aryans. Saïd counsels a guilt-stricken Beecher to give up his relationship with Keller and help Guenzel any way he can. Beecher asks Sister Pete to talk to Guenzel and Schillinger; afraid that Guenzel will eventually inform on the Aryans, Schillinger arranges for Guenzel to die during a staged escape attempt. Beecher tells the authorities about Schillinger's rapes of Winthrop and Guenzel and his involvement with Guenzel's death. Warden Leo Glynn moves Schillinger to solitary. Beecher sees Keller, who has just been found guilty of murder, and the two share an intimate kiss.\n\nBeecher is transferred to a safer unit, as McManus sees that he is being targeted by the Aryans for testifying against Schillinger. Beecher's father, Harrison, appeals Keller's death sentence until Winthrop kills him to join the Aryans. Beecher is paroled, inherits his father's law firm, and gets Keller's sentence overturned. However, Beecher is sent back to prison after a lonely Keller arranges for him to get caught buying drugs. Upon returning to Oz, Beecher severs ties with Keller. In an attempt to make Beecher forgive him, Keller switches a prop knife for a real one before a prison production of \"Macbeth\", resulting in Schillinger's death when Beecher stabs him. When Beecher rejects Keller for the final time, Keller throws himself backwards over a railing while screaming \"Beecher, DON'T!\", both committing suicide and implicating Beecher as his killer. At the end of the series, Beecher awaits trial for Keller's death.\n\n"}

He was also involved in running whiskey into Indian Territory and rustling stock. Starr was the grandfather of Henry Starr and father in-law to Belle Starr, through her marriage to Sam Starr. \nStarr's father was James Starr, a Cherokee leader and a signer of the Treaty of New Echota in December 1835. This treaty had a large impact on the unity and well being of the Cherokee Nation, and many tribal members disagreed with its signing. James Starr was targeted for assassination by Cherokee opposing the treaty, followers of the anti-Removal National Party led by John Ross, and on more than one occasion narrowly escaped death.\n\nA violent series of confrontations eventually led to a Cherokee civil war. Treaty supporters, including the Starr family, James Starr and his six sons, opposed the Ross faction. In retaliation for the attempts on his father's life, Tom Starr became a guerrilla leader in civil war activities. He was accused of attacking and murdering Ross supporter and trader, Benjamin Vore, and his family, at their home near Fort Gibson in 1843. In November 1845, James Starr and his son Buck were attacked at their home by thirty-two armed men and both were killed. Tom Starr witnessed the event but escaped and vowed to avenge the life of his father. The Ross faction of the Cherokee Nation placed a price on Starr's head, and declared him and his surviving brothers outlaw. At least 34 politically related murders were committed among the Cherokee in 1845 and 1846.\n\nThe internal Cherokee conflict ended with a formal truce in 1846. The resulting peace treaty between the two factions included a special clause pardoning citizens of the Cherokee Nation for offenses and crimes, and this pardon was extended to Tom Starr. Starr settled land in the southern portion of the Canadian District of the Cherokee Nation, near present-day Briartown, Oklahoma. The Starr brothers and their extended family used the base for a series of crimes, including arson and the theft of cattle, horses and supplies. Starr was alleged to have killed 100 men throughout his lifetime, although the figure is probably exaggerated. Starr also served in Confederate forces during the American Civil War as a scout for General Stand Watie and was acquainted with William Clark Quantrill.\n\n\n\n"}

He was known best for his research into the relationship between infrasound and ghostly apparitions.\n\nDuring 2001 Tandy was asked to investigate the cellar of Coventry's Tourist Information Centre and in 2004 he was part of a research group looking for paranormal activity in Warwick Castle. In both cases he found high levels of infrasound present. Tandy also conducted large-scaled experiments including one experiment on 750 participants at London's Royal Festival Hall.\n\nTandy also wrote a computer column for the newspaper \"Coventry Telegraph\". He was also an associate member of the Society for Psychical Research.\n\nVic Tandy had an interest in traditional conjuring skills and tricks used by stage magicians. He believed this type of knowledge allowed him to detect hoaxes. He was at the time of his death a fully paid member of the \"Leamington and Warwick Magic Society\".\n\nDuring the early 1980s Tandy was working in a research laboratory for a medical manufacturing company, when, in his own words: \"I was sweating but cold, and the feeling of depression was noticeable – but there was also something else. It was as though something was in the room with me.\" Tandy then claimed to have seen a spirit emerging in his peripheral vision, but when he turned to face the figure, it vanished.\n\nHe discovered the cause of the \"haunting\" by accident. The next day Tandy, a keen fencer, was polishing his sword when he noticed that the blade was vibrating even when clamped in a vice. From this Tandy developed the idea that infrasound might be present in the laboratory. Further experimentation showed that the infrasound trapped in the laboratory was at its highest next to Tandy's desk, right where he had seen the ghost. The infrasound was found to have come from a newly installed extractor fan.\n\nTandy went on to recreate his experience, and with the assistance of Dr. Tony Lawrence, he was able to publish his findings in the \"\". Their research led them to conclude that infrasound at or around a frequency of 19 Hz, has a range of physiological effects, including feelings of fear and shivering. Though this had been known for many years, Tandy and Lawrence were the first people to link it to ghostly sightings.\n\nTandy also appeared in the \"Ghosts on the London Underground\" documentary.\n"}
